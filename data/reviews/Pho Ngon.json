{"text":"Ridiculous. 10 minutes standing by the table, waiting for it to be cleaned before I sat down, 25 minutes waiting for the order to be taken, 20 minutes waiting on Pho. Never got it. I had to leave, by that time my lunch break was over. Can't imagine what was going on there before if they're so proud of their New Management."}
{"text":"The food is great, but if you have any kind of allergies please do your research. I took my girlfriend there and made them aware of her allergies. The waitress reassured us that is was okay to eat. 5 mins later she had an allergic reaction to her meal. They need better training."}
{"text":"Pho N'gon is possibly one of the best and cleanest places to eat Vietnamese food. Here are the reasons why I will go back:  1. The place was super clean and neat.   2. There were two Pho restaurants in Korea Town, but I decided on Pho N'gon because it was AMAZINGLY clean. I was amazed at the decor and modern bathrooms  3. The Pho was especially delicious, just enough taste and without the MSG. The spring rolls were fabulous without being overly-greasy.   4. The staff was super kind, without being too annoying. She showed a great concern for the food and our satisfaction. I also noticed that she was always up on her feet, like cleaning the tables(unlike other waitress' who just sit on their butts all day and do absolutely nothing)  I will be going back to Pho N'gon very soon.  P.S - My boyfriend tells me there is a little surprise in the men's bathroom. Why not check it out when you're in Korea Town, you will not be disappointed. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I ordered the house special, which is the special in most houses as the name, \"Dac Biet\", means \"special\". Raw beef, with tendon, brisket, flank, tripe, and fatty flank; topped with thinly shaved onions (which cook practically instantly when you flip the noodles and mix the bowl up) and scallions. The soup was incredibly clear but deep in flavor; beefy but not murky. The more I ate, the more I could literally feel the threads on my shirt tightening up to resist the role as host to the smell molecules from attaching themselves."}
{"text":"This used to be our go-to lunch place after visiting the regional farmers market. Today was the first time we visited after they changed management.  What a HUGE letdown. The broth of their pho was flavorless even though it had a distinctive dark color. I walked out and paid at the counter with 1/2 bowl of my lunch unfinished.   The huge sign outside their door about new management should be a warning to old customers who came here for the food. I wish they would tell me where the old chef and staff went and I'll gladly follow. But we won't be returning here for sure."}
{"text":"Waited 45 mins without food. Didnt even get water for 15mins..We had to leave the place without food. Will never come back again"}
{"text":"La meilleure pho que je connaisse. Tout est frais. Pas de viande à fondue comme ça l'arrive d'habitude."}
{"text":"I have gone twice. First time we went I loved the food but the service was poor. Second time, I ordered take out and they did not give me or my boyfriend what we ordered and the service at the register was poor. I like the food but the wait staff could brush up a bit."}
{"text":"I have not had Pho in the past, although I was definitely curious as I have heard so much about it.  I also have never had either beef tendon or tripe.  So not knowing what I wanted, I ordered the combination Pho that included top round, flank, beef tendon, beef ball, and tripe.  The food came out quickly, and it was phenomenal.  I seriously enjoyed it so much that I will always order the combination.  The addition of fresh bean sprouts, Thai basil, jalapeño, and lime really complimented the flavor of the broth and meats.  I was so impressed with the quality of the food, I ordered a cured ham Banh mi to go so that I could try that for a midnight snack.  Very convenient location, and very reasonable prices.  Recommend highly!"}
{"text":"I really like their Pho. Other posters have complained about the broth, but that's my favorite part. I suppose it's a matter of taste, but I very much like that the broth is not over spiced with cinnamon and other spices. The noodles are great, the meat quantity is good. Great Pho."}
{"text":"First of all, I want to say that I am not a chronic complainer about restaurants. I travel a lot and have eaten in a lot of restaurants across the country. This was absolutely the biggest rip off of a restaurant that I have ever, repeat ever, that I have been to. I ordered a combo stir fry and got about 2 pieces of beef, 2 pieces of tough chicken, 2 shrimp and no pork. I only give them one star because I couldn't give them none. And, to cap it off, when I told the waitress, she laughed. Save your money, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This place is clean because its still brand new.   We tried this place out and ordered some spring rolls and two bowls of their Pho.  The spring rolls were pretty small and very oily.   The Pho broth was good, but there was little meat / content.  We had to reorder again two more bowls of Pho, and to be honest we were still hungry after the second bowl."}
{"text":"The pho and vermicelli noodles were both very good. The broth was authentic and quite flavorful and the meats were very tasty. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Although good but the service was not there and then more than half the menu they were out of it............its not that we went in late close to closing time ....which was a big disappointment and would be really desperate to go back there now ....."}
{"text":"What a surprise!  We visited for lunch today.  The food is out of this world.  I will definitely make this a regular spot."}
{"text":"I order Togo only three times there, first time I order banh xeo ( Vietnamese pan cake) I have to say wow one banh xeo extra meat and shrimp for $12.  Second times smoothie is super suck all pounder for 4.50. Third time 2 banh mi, 1 grill pork and 1 Cha lua, 5:50 each. Banh mi okay not bad but $5:50 i recommend more meat. If anyone want Vietnamese sandwiches go to LE sandwiches. Less than $3:00 and you will get more meat."}
{"text":"I prefer the Pho here to all the other pho places I've tried in the area as well as in China town. The Pho was served piping hot, which is only notable because I've been served too many luke warm Pho's at other places in the area. It's very clean, the noodles were well cooked, and there was a decent amount of beef.  I agree that the broth is somewhat mild, though I find it preferable to places that have too much cinnamon flavor, or are too oily. The portions aren't as enormous as a lot of other pho places, so get the large."}
{"text":"Had I written a review after having their Bun Thit Nuong, I would have rated Pho Ngon 4 stars. It was some of the best I have ever had and the portion was huge.   I went back with a Vietnamese friend one evening and found the food average this time.  I opted for the Vietnamese papaya salad and spring rolls with grilled pork. I love Thai papaya salad and found the Vietnamese version quite different. I liked the jerky style beef pieces on the salad but the salad itself was not very flavorful except for being a little spicy. The spring rolls with dipping sauce were bland and the rice paper wrap didn't have the perfect texture.   My friend ordered a bowl of Pho and said it was not as good as the one from a highly rated Pho place in Chicago suburbs she frequents, not to mention it was almost 30% more expensive than the Pho in Chicago suburbs. $9 for a bowl of pho is pricy.   They do have several Vietnamese hot pots on the menu which you don't normally see in Vietnamese restaurants. I may give them a try one day."}
{"text":"Pho is great. If you are looking for authenticity. ..then this is the place. Food service is prompt with a smile.  Take out orders are always accurate  and still hot when you eat it.  Great find"}
{"text":"Wasn't too memorable for pho', but it wasn't bad. Bathrooms were clean, so that's pretty good. I think you could do better on this stretch."}
{"text":"Love this place, been coming since they were next door, except the food is even better now they are pho ngon, staff is always super friendly and the Tom Yum hot pot is one of the best in Charlotte, plus they carry Ban Mi which I love and is my staple for lunch.  Highly recommend trying this place"}
{"text":"Pho Ngon is Ngon! The pho dac biet was delicious, as was the banh mi and egg rolls (cha gio) Admittedly $4 for 2 egg rolls is entirely too expensive, and $5.50 for thit nuong banh mi is also high. But If you're craving for it, it beats driving all the way to Asian corner for a Le's banh mi  ;-) I'm so happy the LA crawfish owner decided to change his focus and leave the seafood behind but stick to what they do best so now there is delicious pho to eat in south Charlotte! Cam on nhieu!"}
{"text":"I was deeply disappointed this time. Being their customer for the 6th time within 1.5 month, I decide to update/revise/change my opinion toward this restaurant. I took a grilled chicken vermicelli with an imperial roll. I specified no salad in my order except cucumbers  and they said they can replace the salad with more vermicelli rice noodle. OK fine, I appreciated their gratitude. After I got home I opened my order, my lord! Only half of the box of rice noodle with the chicken on top. Apparently the chicken was deep-fried, dry, and very chewy. The size of thi is order is actually much smaller than what we normally get when dining in (see photo)."}
{"text":"Hunting for Korean food we ended up in downtown K-town. And then we decided to get ... pho.  The venue is new and clean. My friend noticed the brand of condensed milk that they use for their Vietnamese coffee.  They use the good shit. A good sign.  The server was the nicest lady ever. The super large bowl of pho is ginormous. They use the skinny noodles (some people like them, some don't) which were perfectly cooked. The broth was tasty but not as potent as other places. A bit fishy and fatty for my taste but decent.  I would have given the place 3 stars except that I almost overdosed on MSG.  The second I got into the car I could barely see straight.  MSG exhaustion started to set in... my mouth went instantly dry... so tired..I  zzZzzzzzzzz."}
{"text":"This place started out great - until they underwent new management (by one of the Central pho places). The only saving grace is their vermicelli bowl, which is so well-crafted that you'd think it'd be an indication that they'd make other great dishes. The pho is dark but bland, and the papaya salad is the worst I've tasted since my own, at my first attempt many years ago. Ride up to Pho Cali instead if you want good Vietnamese."}
{"text":"I love the food there. It's so fresh and delectable.  My recommendations are Cantonese Chow Mein, Pad Thai, Satay chicken or beef. It's delicious and never a regret. I also love the service! All the staff there are so friendly and kind. Very helpful and have a constant smile on their face. Oh, and best of all I love how it's late night! Fri and Sat this restaurant is opened till 4:00a.m. If you're in need of food, they have you covered and the only restaurant opened. They also have this pho-king spicy challenge that is really entertaining and fun. Check out their hall of shame and hall of flame, genius concept! and even better to watch it in action. It's an awesome place, can't complain!"}
{"text":"It's a fairly small place, no bells and whistles but one thing you can't go wrong here is the superb Pho. I've been there perhaps over a dozen times and keep going back for their Dac Viet soup. It's #8 on the menu, it's a must try. Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"I was here for the Grande Opening a few years ago, and I tell you what; if I was craving for Vietnamese food anywhere South of Bloor, this is unquestionably the only place I would go.  First & foremost, CLEAN WASHROOM.  Thank Goodness for that, because this hipster neighborhood is crammed with tiny storefronts and legobox restaurants that somehow evade the health inspector again & again, Pho Ngon's diligence on their cleanliness compared to it's competitors is simply first rate.     Things you won't find here: - taste of cutting corners - rats - cockroaches - nonchalant staff - stale meat  Things you will find: - f&%king beautifully cooked meat - evidence of Lysol or Mr. Clean - friendly service - a girl with a nice.....personality  I don't frequent this area, not my scene.  Opening a pho restaurant here was a bold move, but I was glad to see that the owners had the fish balls to back it up.  Try their meat & rice dishes, I asked how the chef cooked it.  He wouldn't tell me.  So I resorted to begging, and he still wouldn't tell me.  I was going to give him my \"I'm a big guy and I'm angry\" face, but his meat cleaver was HUGE!"}
{"text":"Important things first: cash only (they have an ATM) and very inexpensive.   Most dishes were $8-12 tax in before tip. The portions were good and it was yummy. Service was fairly quick. We were never brought waters though, although the reason we didn't ask either was because we were under the impression that there was no bathroom. (I had asked our waiter if there was a bathroom in both French and English and he just gestured outside randomly... But I think he didn't just understand me because when we were leaving I saw the bathroom. weird.) They were playing acoustic versions of 90's hits. There were tv's playing the Food Network. It's located on the side of the highway.  I would describe it as a Vietnamese diner with good soup and fair service. Probably your best bet for something close to the Saint-Michel flea market."}
{"text":"Better than Saigon Palace, both food and atmosphere. The pork sandwich was 10/10. The meat is cooked to perfection. I got the grilled shrimp and grilled pork bun, I would definetely recommend. Friend got the Pho and he agreed it is better than Saigon Palace."}
{"text":"Was in the mood for Pho. My mom and I got pho bowls and they were delicious. Very good sauce options to add some spice as well. I mixed the garlic chili and the regular chili sauce. My Dad got the ribs. My boyfriend got the chicken curry and it was unlike any curry we had before (not like Indian or Thai curry). It was delicious. The place itself is hard to find. I used the directions from the app and it told us we were there in the middle of the road. The building itself in the end was beside us but the entrance is not there. We spent some time trying to find it but it was well worth it in the end!!!"}
{"text":"If I could give more stars I would. The location is super convenient (which isn't the case for most Viet places here) and the smell of the food itself had me sold! Our food came out fast and hot despite us having a 15+ table. I ordered the bun thit nuong w/ egg rolls and a PHO dac biet both were equally as delicious. Recommending this to all my friends and will be back often!!!"}
{"text":"Service: our waitress was sweet. Food came out fast after we ordered. Only a few tables were there when we walked in so we got seated quickly.   Food: I got summer rolls to start off and they were yummy. The dipping sauce is not peanut-y like Doan's, so I liked it a lot. The man boo got a regular pho combo and I got the Vietnamese pancake (banh xeo). He liked his pho, he said it was meatier than most places. I tasted his pho before he added all the hoisin and Sriracha in it and I like it for a restaurant pho. Lol. Being Vietnamese, my mom makes the best pho so I don't usually order pho when I eat out. So if I like it then it's probably really good to a lot of people. My pancake was good! It was a pale yellow, not bright yellow like most places, hope that meant less food color was used. Regardless, it was delicious. My only concern with the pancake was that it only came with one. Most places, you get two. I was still hungry after my meal so I ordered hu tieu xao (stir fry noodles). Although it was a little bit on the oily side for me, it was yummy and came with a lot of veggies (not complaining).   Atmosphere: nice and clean. The only thing that took away one star was I don't like how smokey it was in there when they were cooking our food. The kitchen definitely needs better ventilation because we smelled like food when we left.   With all that being said, I hope they take care of the ventilation issue because I would like to come back and try other food on the menu!"}
{"text":"Best vietnamese on my side of town-- Steele creek/ayrsley but not the best I've ever had. Still the portions are great, customer service is great, and the veggies in the bun are plentiful and fresh. I would recommend if you're on this side of town. However if you're in the mood for really good vietnamese with a lot of variety and vegetarian options-- and you don't mind the drive -- I would suggest Ben Than out in Matthews."}
{"text":"It used to be delicious. However it recently went under new management. Took a unique authentic Vietnamese dish off the menu, bun rieu. Also, the new management served burnt flavorless chicken wings to us during one of the slowest times for restaurants 3:00pm - 4:00pm.  The bun bo hue broth was great, but the medium had 7 pieces of meat...in total. It no longer has pork hocks or huyet which are staples in bun bo hue and made this place authentic and a notch above the others in charlotte.  Additionally, it lacked many drinks which used to be on the menu -- coconut juice being the biggest necessity.  No longer worth my 40-min commute to eat here.  The only perk was the bubbly sweet server that saved this entire situation."}
{"text":"I got the stir fry and it was ok. So okay in fact that by the time I was halfway down the street I forgot if I had ate anything or not."}
{"text":"The best Vietnamese food we've had outside of Hawaii!!! I had the Pho (combination) and Taro Bubble Tea. The Pho was delicious and served piping hot.  The regular size is more than enough for 2 people.  The Taro Bubble Tea was a nice end to my lunch."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, management has changed at this location and the food has taken a turn for the worst. If you like An Hoa on Central, you'll probably like this location as they're owned by the same people but my family has always thought An Hoa was mediocre in comparison to other Vietnamese restaurants in the Queen City.  We ordered pho and hu tieu mi dac biet and we're disappointed with both. The pho had very little beef flavor and overwhelmingly tasted of anise, suggesting that the beef bones were not simmered for long and too much anise was used to compensate for the lack of flavor. The broth was also incredibly fatty, indicating that they did not frequently scoop impurities that float to the top during the cooking process. By default, pho broth should be clear and free of oil beads at the top. You should only get fatty broth if you request it and we did not.  The hu tieu mi wasn't as disappointing as the pho. You get a variety of noodles to choose from including our favorite, clear noodles. It had a decent amount of toppings and the quail egg was the cherry on top for me. However, the taste was compromised by too much sesame oil. Underneath it all, we could also tell that the seafood was on the side of fishy. My sister ended up passing some of the fishier toppings to me since four years of college helped me develop a higher tolerance for subpar food.  On the plus side, portions were very generous. A medium bowl here is easily a large bowl elsewhere. You also get plenty of vegetables on the side and they can replenish if you run out for your table.   Service-wise, it was average. We arrived at 8PM on a Saturday and the place was 1/4 full. We were seated quickly and we got our drinks soon after. Approximately 10 minutes after we placed our orders, one person received their dish and that's when we realized that our table was out of spoons and sauce dishes. We didn't see our server until she came back with the rest of our food and that's when we were able to request missing items. Once we were served, our server came back to our table occasionally to see if we needed refills for drinks and/or vegetables.  All in all, I don't think we'll be back to this location unless we're not feeling the drive to better restaurants further in the city."}
{"text":"Resto où le service est ultra rapide, bon et pas cher. Un grand choix de combo et de plats...Mais ce qu'il reste de meilleur c'est leur fameuse soupe tonki pour nous aider à passer notre dûr hiver  quebecois ou notre hangover du dimanche!...ils font même pour emporter!"}
{"text":"Wasn't feeling well so I optioned for some pho today.. This was one of the place I bookmark! Typical place for pho and other Vietnamese dishes! I had the medium size bowl of pho with beef meatballs. My cousin have cellophane noodle soup.. I wouldn't say it's great. I have had better. Customer service was pleasant and quick..  I do like their Vietnamese ice coffee. Not sure if I'll be back since there's a lot of Vietnamese restaurants around Steele Creek!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Pho places in Queen City. Good food, great service, and nice location."}
{"text":"This place was great. Not sure what the complaints are for. I had the crispy spring rolls, small chicken pho, and Thai tea with boba. No complaints from me. Everything tastes great and came out fast! The prices were reasonable. I like the fact they have small, medium, or large sizes for the pho because I can never finish your typical bowl of pho. I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Alright so I had decided it  was time to try a few new pho places.  Went for lunch with a few friends here goes the list of everything that went wrong, it must have had something to do with the law of attraction, it was working against me.   We placed an order of bubble tea, received our drinks and noticed no tapioca balls. Asked the waitress over to see if she had mixed up our order, she just said they did not have tapioca balls. Wish I had been informed of that before I ordered the \"bubble tea\".   So we ordered pho, two different kinds. And also decided to order the crispy spring rolls.  The rolls were flavorless and overly greasy.   The pho : - not enough broth - tastless broth - very thick noodles - i had to ask for limes and herbs since there was only 2 to share in between 4 people   Now to add on to the fact that I was not enjoying my broth, half way through I notice a nice piece of hair on my noodles. Yupppp thats extra flavor for you.   The only reason they are getting 2 stars instead of 1 is that at least the waitress did not charge me for that pho and also gave me the option to order anything else from the menu free of charge, even though I did not.   When it came time for our check, she had done the calculations wrong and we had got charged an extra $12.  We sent the check back and had it fixes. We payed in cash so had to wait for some change, and when that came it was half of what we were supposed to get, so had to send that back as well.   Now do you see what I meant by the law of attraction? Yes, this place will not see me or my friends again."}
{"text":"So I tried this place today and being Vietnamese I'm never optimistic about Vietnamese restaurants in the Charlotte area they always seem to know how to disappoint. I always like to order a lot and try out all different dishes before I judge a place, so I had the combination vermicelli noodles, the quail appetizer and also the grilled pork banh mi. I was impressed with the banh mi the grilled pork actually tasted like grilled pork with a nice smokey char taste, so it was grilled the correct way and oven baked stir fried like other places do and call it grilled pork. Quail was great and, also the noodles was on point. I order the stir fried seafood noodles for my mom and seafood stir fry with rice for pops, and them being traditional Vietnamese and we owning a cafe ourselves they the hardest to satisfy bc they always say they can make it better them self but it's was good. So I will be back to try everything else. Forget to mention service, the waitress I got was exceptional and very knowledgable of the menu when I tested her on things lol me being difficult."}
{"text":"Looking for a great cozy spot for some wholesome pho soup...well this spot should be on your list of places to try some great pho soup. I recently found this place with a friend of mine and we loved their pho soup. Portions are great and so are the prices. Tried their  flank and beef pho soup and loved. Their soup broth is just perfect and super tasty. I recommend their large soup portions as the extra large is way too big. Large is just perfect size and medium is ok if you are not so hungry. The soup comes with a side plate of fresh herbs, hot peppers and bean sprouts ..all very fresh and add great taste to the soup.  Must not forget to mention their delicious imperial rolls...perfect appetizer. The place itself is simple and very busy. Service is friendly as well  Will definately go back!"}
{"text":"Underdog Challenge 22/30  I stumbled into Pho Ngon looking for eat after having driven through 17th and been unable to find a place decent enough. Finally after I almost gave up hope as I was exiting past 14th st I spotted Pho and quickly parked my car and ran in.  It was empty and they were just minutes to closing but the old man was kind enough to let me know I was more than welcome to order anything off the menu and stay. But I felt bad and had friends to catch up with so I ordered a sate sub and shredded beef rolls to go.  The food was amazing, the sub was crispy and seemed to have the right portion of herbs, veggies, and meat. It's a shame no one was around to bear witness to me setting the world record for the fastest time to inhale a sub. I was still hungry and the beef shredded rolls was polished off."}
{"text":"I have a penchant for hole in the wall spots and this one pleasantly surprised me with how tasty their dishes always are. I love noodle bowls and this place has a good one, I also absolutely adore summer rolls. Definitely would recommend this place to anyone in good of good, reasonably priced take out."}
{"text":"I gave Pho Ngon a try and it was the worse experience I've ever had for Vietnamese food. As you can see in the picture I posted the Pho I ordered was extremely oily. It's the worse Pho I've ever had in my life. I ordered the seafood one but my girl got the flank and it was just as bad. In fact she got sick later. I complained to my server and she said she would talk to the manager. Several minutes later we saw her again but she didn't come to our table. Finally I waved her over. I asked her if the manager was coming. She had this perplexed look on her face and started babbling then said hold on ill go back to manager. She came back and said the manager said it was cooked the way it's supposed to be. I told her I've eaten pho many times and it never tasted as nasty as this. They gave me a lousy 10% off. As we were leaving the manager finally came out to me. He was very argumentative and said it was cooked as expected. I told him I've had pho at plenty of places and it never tasted like that. Obviously I won't be going back. Do yourself a favor and avoid this place. There's a much better Pho location a block down the road. They know how to make it properly and their service is much better. Try Pho Cali instead 9107 S Tryon St Charlotte, NC  28273 United States"}
{"text":"My whole family requested we do 5 stars. We came for Pho and I have had it in Chinatown as my best experience, this surpasses that. Broth was so beautiful, generous portion of basil, bean sprouts and lime... A little fish sauce and perfection! My husband got the stir fry and it was fantastic as well, great sauce and portion size with nice fresh everything. Definitely coming back :)"}
{"text":"The 1 star is not for their food. It's for their service.  It's my pet peeve that restaurants need to honor the hours they post. On their door and in Yelp, it says they close at 9 pm on Thursday.   I stopped by, hoping to enjoy some Vietnamese food on my way to the airport and walked in their food at 8:45 pm. The hostess said they were closed. But then she said if I got something simple then she could ask the kitchen. I quickly settled on a banh mi sandwich.   But no. Not good enough.   If the employees want to be OUT the food at 9 pm, THEN CLOSE AT 8:30 pm!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I am giving this place 3.5 stars, but am rounding it up to 4 because it's one of those places that has potential to be a lot better.  Anyone who goes here needs to know that it will have growing pains.  Here's the rundown:  1. Pho noodles are thick (fresh) -- I consider this to be a very very good thing.  If you want thin packaged dry noodles, you can ask for them (barf).  2. Noodles are nice but the broth is a bit bland.  This is very common for those pho broths that don't use MSG (see Ossington joints).  This broth could use more star anise and maybe more bones to give it a fuller flavor.  MSG haters will probably enjoy this a lot.  I like MSG in my soup, so it was slightly disappointing.  3. Staff was super nice and the decor is modern and ridiculously clean.  They even have a shower for their staff to use.  I got a peak at it and it's straight up ballah!  4. Fried rice.  What the hell?  Ok, my friend ordered this.  Was quite good actually for fried rice.  Not really my thing.  5. Spring rolls (fried) were nice.  Not overly greasy, extremely large or too small.  Good size and fresh.  6. Cold rolls (with shrimp) was ok.  The wrap had a bit of oil on it and it was a little firmer than I would have liked.  Another second in warm water would easily solve that problem.  7. Decent location for a pho joint.  There's not many options of this genre in the area.  8. As a side -- their main chef was not there that day, this may have affected the quality of the food slightly, and one menu item (banh xeo/Vietnamese crepe) wasn't available.  9. As another side -- the menu opens left to right!  I felt right at home.  It is also much more abbreviated than the menus you see at other Viet places, but I am sure they would accommodate you for items not on the menu.  As I recall, there was no Vietnamese language on the menu either.  Will definitely check it out again."}
{"text":"Favorite bowl of Pho to date! I couldn't believe how the broth stayed hot cooking the bean sprouts. The waitress told me they even dip the ceramic bowls into boiling water to ensure the perfect temperature. I usually have to dip my meats into a half and half of hoisin & sriracha sauce but broth was perfectly flavored. My boyfriend got the chicken curry with vermicelli. We loved the spices and vegetable combination. We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"I've only been here once before when they first opened and since they were still fairly new, I thought that maybe they were still trying to figure things out. That time, my friends and I all ordered pho and it was very oily and tasteless. I actually don't normally order pho when I go eat at Vietnamese restaurants since nothing beats my mother's but I do know a good bowl of pho when I eat one. For a place that translates to \"delicious pho\", their pho is the worst I've had.   I've told my parents about this place and that they may want to avoid it but since they knew I didn't care much for pho, they didn't believe me, and we ended up here for dinner last night. My parents have never gotten the chance to go before and they wanted to try it out because after all, how could a place called \"delicious Pho\" not have delicious pho?  Even though it was a Sunday night, the place only had a couple of customers. We all got just water and a taro bubble tea for my little brother. It took about 5 minutes for us to receive our waters which seemed a little strange. My father and little brother each ordered pho and my mother and I each ordered bun dac biet (a combination vermicelli bowl.) The pho looked good when it came out but the flavor ended up being just as bad as I remembered it. The noodles in my brother's bowl were hard and all clumped together. The bun dac biet is my most favorite thing to get and it looked very promising when it came out. The bowl was full of meat and veggies so I was super excited to eat it. The noodles were really soft and slippery and it was actually hard to pick up with chopsticks since it kept slipping right through. The meat, however, was full of flavor and the veggies tasted fresh so it was disappointing when the fish sauce it came with ended up being very plain? It seemed watered down and even after I poured two of the little cups of fish sauce into my bowl, my food still tasted the same as it did without the sauce. My mother also asked for a side of clear soup and that soup ended up being way saltier than my fish sauce. Like how is that possible?? So remember how I said we also got a bubble tea? There was still no sign of that and we were almost done with our food. We reminded the waitress twice and the first time, she ran off (yes, she actually ran) to go get it.. At least that's what we assumed. When we didn't hear a blender after a while, we asked her about it again. She said they forgot about it(?) and rushed off again. Don't worry, they remembered this time. We all finished our food because we were starving but in the car, my parents said its been a very long time since they've had such bad Vietnamese food and won't be back.  I'd give this place a zero star rating for the food if I could and the only reason they're getting two is because 1) the bubble tea was very good and refreshing and 2) Even though we had to remind our waitress about the bubble tea, the service itself was good. They were polite and fast. A little too fast. We felt bad because the waitresses were actually zooming around the place. (Don't get me wrong, we were impressed with their commitment but worried that they were stressed out.)"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite to eat during lunch. I just got a banh mi, and it wasn't bad! I thought it was pretty filling, and as I came here with someone, I just got something because I was pretty much full when I came in there.   Interior wise, it's nice, clean, and pretty chill. I think I saw someone in the corner eating a hot pot. If you do order the Bun bo hue, I believe there are good days and bad days? I don't know, but I think if you're going to ask might as hope it's a good one right?  In the end, I only ate half of my banh mi and saved the other half for later.  I think this place is pretty good, as far as the banh mi, it wasn't bad, but at the same time it wasn't to die for and there are probably better places to get banh mi. If I ever get the chance to come back here I would like to try their pho."}
{"text":"This place had decent food, but the service was horrible. We ordered chicken wings and fries for our young kids and when the wings came out we were told there were no fries and given no substitution. On top of that, the wings were overcooked (fried) and had very little meat.   Three of us ordered Pho noodle dishes and they came out at completely different times. My daughter got hers a full 5 minutes after me and wife's order came after the rest of us had finished eating. There was no explanation or apology.   We ended up stopping on the way home to get my young kids some food... since the wings were garbage and the fries were \"all gone\"."}
{"text":"Not bad.  Not a huge pho fan and this was my first experience with it.  Place was pretty big and service was friendly.  Probably won't be back.  Food seemed fresh and I'm sure if I liked Pho more I'd be back.  Prices were reasonable!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for a Bahn-mi but had to get it to go because the restaurant was way too hot. I told the girl this and she replied that she was cold. They didn't have a single fan going. Fix the A/C or turn on the fans. So I had to eat my sandwich out on the patio where the bugs are. I hate to do that."}
{"text":"Of course this was during my lunch break, I seem to be eating out a lot more for lunch now a days...  anyways, our break was an hour and this just made the cut off time!  When we got there we had to wait a couple minutes for them to clean off a table (even though they had plenty of other ones already available). It did not seem that long for the waitress to come over and grab our drink orders - and I ordered an appetizer (summer rolls).  The summer rolls were yummy. They seemed to use fresh leafy greens, but the rice wrapper was a little thicker than others which made it a little harder to \"rip\" when I bit into it.  I ordered a number 2; it did not take that long for the food to arrive at the table. It was pretty hot, so that's good. The broth is beef based so it was on the darker side. The plate of \"toppings\" all seemed really fresh and tasted delicious!  However... the server did not check on us until basically we were almost done (just sipping on broth). Also when the checks came I was paying with cash (my total was $12.45). She gave me $7... what happened to my .55 cents?!? I thought this was rather rude and I felt \"gypped\".  The Pho was not the best I have had, but I will probably came back for lunch since this is the closest one to my work, but I will be more cautious about the money situation...  Also, my coworker's bill (I cannot remember the total) was paid with a card and the total was different than what he was previously given two minutes prior on the receipt. I looked at the receipt and I noticed she did not have his beverage on it and that's where the different amount came from. I have worked in the restaurant business for several years and I would never charge someone's card a different amount without even telling them before I do. The service was not horrible, but not good either. She gave us our drinks, our food, and the checks. I believe she needs a little more training in work ethic though.   P.S. I did leave her $2 (plus the .55 cents she neglected to give me). Which is a 20% tip."}
{"text":"First time I ever had the pho and it was pho-king delicious! The broth is awesome. I had the brisket. Started off with 2 different types of rolls.2 fresh summer rolls and 2 grilled pork rolls. The pork was a bit salty and good, but the summer rolls were awesome. Loved the selection of condiments on the table. Service was fast and friendly. The sweet tea was good, too. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Pho Ngon has some great Pho. Jammed full of ingredients, it is such a filling and great-tasting soup. There was a bit of a wait to be seated as the place was packed. The service was friendly and reasonably quick."}
{"text":"This place has become my little solo-sancturary for meals I want to have alone. I often crave Pho or Vermacelli (sp?) and just want to get away by myself and this is where I head now! It's very delicious, almost always open, clean (enough), and has great service! What more could you ask for in a local vietnamese joint?!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Ordered com tam suon dai han, pho, bum thit nuoung.  For 8 people, they already put on gratuity, didn't know til I got home."}
{"text":"Great food.. Just had the pho (very good) and banh mi (excellent) the service is where I dock 2 stars.. Very sweet but one waitress flat out ignored me and the other was doing what she could despite being the hostess.. Waited forever for drinks.. Waited forever for food and had to ask 3x for condiments for soup.. Will come back and hope for better service"}
{"text":"I took my girlfriend out to this restaurant. Hands down one of the worst food experiences I've ever had. The food is so horrible you wouldn't feed to your dog. The portions are small. The server didn't refill my cup of water once. I had to GET UP MYSELF, GRAB THE PITCHER AMD REFILL. And while checking out they got rude and demanding for tip for a service the wasnt existent. I am a generous tipper. I always tip 20% minimum for average service. But this was just horrible. Do yourself a favor and find a different spot. The staff was rude and very disrespectful"}
{"text":"Love the banh mi, it's the same price as a burger so I don't know why anyone is complaining about that, and I would buy this over a burger any day , sure le's is cheaper and has more meat. But if you are true Viet like myself, you know the quality over there is very poor and the bread taste stale. I rather pay to get the best and this is the best banh mi in Charlotte hands down. Can't wait to try the other dishes if I could get myself to order anything else, but there banh mi is my new daily craving."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this place.  My wife and I have been here twice for dinner, and both times it was empty.  But, we don't know why, because we love it. So don't be alarmed if there aren't a lot of people.  The menu offers a good selection of items, and it's pretty easy to understand what your ordering (not always the case with Vietnamese places).  My wife got the stir fry and really enjoyed it.  I got a rice noodle bowl, and it was excellent.  A great spot.  Try it out"}
{"text":"The pho here is probably the best pho in Charlotte.  They give the right about of meat with pho and broth.  Some places will give you a lot of noodles and not enough broth.  The veggies are fresh.  We also had the clay pot fish.  There's not a fishy taste to it because cat fish is usually the fish used for the clay pot dish.  I really enjoyed it.  When making this dish you need the correct flavor but also cook it long enough so that the flavor covers the fishy taste. If there's a fishy taste, that means it's uncooked or prepared wrong.  Trust me, I'm Vietnamese, I know lol."}
{"text":"I am a bahn mi lover and people around Charlotte swear that le's bahn mi is best in Charlotte, and I disagree Pho Ngon has hand down best bahn mi in Charlotte actually it is the best bahn mi I have had period. The pho is great and the summer rolls are awesome but the bahn mi is amazing!"}
{"text":"Visiting town and had a great bowl of Pho here. When price is also reasonable and service great it's a win!"}
{"text":"Pho here is actually by far the best in Charlotte yet. Service is great! Ordered the pho with tendons and it was delicious. The only downfall is their pho price is really high. The most expensive that I've been too."}
{"text":"Food was good, have had better Pho noodle soup though. Customer service was just ok as well. Probably will go back to Pho Calli. If they make it more than a year I will try it again."}
{"text":"The food and service was great! Just vegetarians/vegans beware, they don't offer vegetable stock for their pho. Came specifically for pho and couldn't get it. Most places do offer vegetarian pho... That's the only reason I gave it 1 star less than 5."}
{"text":"My favorite pho place, hands down! The staff is friendly and the service is pretty quick for the limited amount of ppl they have on the floor."}
{"text":"Not the best pho but it's near by so we went. The pho is below average but it's hard to find good pho in mtl so this sort of still hit the pho craving spot. It's very busy usually and the tables are very close together, sometimes u will also be sharing tables with strangers."}
{"text":"We passed by this place on the car and got hungry - and decided to have a take-out order of Grill Pork Chop on Rice.   Upon opening the box at the hotel, it was a total disappointment.   The box had a lot of rice and half piece of pork chop less than 50% of my palm (very very small).   There was nothing else in it  (e.g. vegetables) .   Worse, the pork chop tasted foul - like a re-grilled or was going bad.  The quality and quantity were totally unacceptable.   They must known that we were not local and would not go back because it was a take-out.    Avoid this place if you can."}
{"text":"I have found my favorite hot pot in Charlotte. Even though the weather is warming up I may have to keep coming back for that delicious tom yum broth. The hot pot here is great because all the vegetables and meats come along the rim of the pot keeping the table clear of unnecessary dishes. I love efficiency! The dish comes with a little bit of everything which is great for those of us who don't want to commit to just one thing. Included in the standard price were beef, chicken, shrimp and mussels. The vegetables were a little less plentiful but sufficient. The noodles were fresh and delicious. I also appreciated that they asked if we understood the hot pot process since we have always just muddled along hoping we were doing it right.   I have been for lunch once since they moved from their previous location and branding (LA Crawfish) and while I love the stir fry dishes they have (so much food!) the service is a little slow. I hope they are able to work that out so I don't have to sheepishly sneak back to my desk because my lunch ran over.   Overall this is a great addition to the Ayrsely area and worth a visit. I am almost missing the cold weather so I could properly enjoy my new favorite hot pot."}
{"text":"Was really excited to try this place out after getting my nails done next door. Unfortunately the girl working today was a sad little b****... someone needs to teach her how to be polite and give good service. Her crappy attitude and expressions at my questions about the menu were so aggravating. I left before my blood was boiling any further. Whoevers daughter this is, teach her some manners and how to talk with people. If this happened outside of the establishment little girl would've gotten slapped. Taking my business elsewhere and never returning!"}
{"text":"I was here at 8pm and the Pho and Vermicelli was delicious!! The staff was nice and overall had an amazing how experience."}
{"text":"This was my first trip here. We all ordered Pho and it came out fairly quick! Everyone enjoyed their meals, even though we agreed it wasn't the best Pho we ever ate. Garnish add-on plate was full, fresh and delicious.  The waitress was friendly but she didn't check on us often. When we got the bills, they only had food on them and when she ran cards and returned them magically they had drinks billed and charged on those that ordered something other than ice water? Kind of odd. Seems they can't get the billing correct. Plus my total charged was even different than what the receipt said, only by a penny - but still."}
{"text":"I went a few days ago to this restaurant and it is just ok. Good price and ok service."}
{"text":"Had the shrimp stir fry with vegetables. Asked for it spicy. Meal was great. Fresh vegetables. Great flavor and fresh cilantro etc. Great food and spice was excellent."}
{"text":"Those of you in the west Beltline/Bankview/Lower Mt Royal areas might recall a place at 1439 17th Ave SW called \"Noodle King\" that was IMO the best Viet place on the entire stretch of Uptown 17. I used to get their lemongrass chicken on rice- ohhhhhh, their rice was always perfect- at least once a week. They left for 32nd Ave NE a few years ago and left in their wake the dreadful Pho VK. Well I'm happy to report that the place has changed again and it's now, as of Sept 2, Pho Ngon (say it like it's one word- \"fungon\") and got takeout there (I live maybe one minute's walk up the hill) the last two days. Superb! Really excellent. I've tried veggie spring rolls, chicken salad rolls, a rice bowl with chicken sate, and a noodle bowl with grilled pork and pork spring rolls. All have been delicious, better than co do and not bad value. 10% off everything in Sept."}
{"text":"Let's get down to business....Pho!!!  Yesterday was an icky day and the pho at Pho Ngon hit the spot.   Since I had to share with a little Pho connoisseur (my niece) I opted for the large bowl. The large bowl is $11. We got the pho bo vien with flank. My friend got the pho tai nam.   We were both very happy with the portion and taste of our pho. I order flank steak in my bowl but they put eye round instead. I didn't make a fuss about it.   Inside it's very dark and quiet. The servers are attentive and helpful. However the parking and parking lot are odd.   I will be back to try some of their other dishes.

{"text":"Tried this today for lunch with a buddy of mine, the place is pretty small and it's very full, so if you plan on going around lunch time you'll probably have to wait a little bit for a table.  Anyway we each took a large PHO with grilled chicken, it comes with all the fixins, sprouts, basil, extra cilantro. Ask for some hot peppers for extra spice! The soup came nice and hot, the broth was very flavourful. The chicken was also very good. The noodles are a little all dente that's the way I like it!  The best part is the price. Large soup 9$ and it's very filling for a nice lunch. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Made a quick stop while passing through Charlotte, very convenient from the highway and the banh mi's are really good.   We ordered the Roast Pork Banh Mi and the Cured Ham Banh Mi, both are $5.50 each. Admittedly this is the most expensive banh mi I've ever purchased, but there was a lot of meat in the roast pork. Maybe the ingredients are harder to find in this part of the country and that's why they are more expensive than usual. Despite the price, the bread is 100% authentic and fresh and both meats were delicious, though we preferred the roast pork's flavor. I think they tone down the spice here, which I missed the chili sauce that I'm used to getting. I'm sure that's something I could order if/when I pass by here again.   We also ordered a taro boba smoothie ($4.50), it was good as well. The boba pearls were a little undercooked. The location inside was really clean and well decorated, and the staff very friendly. I'd definitely stop here again if I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS DEFINITELY NOT KNOWN FOR THEIR SERVICE. I waited twenty minutes just to get boba tea without boba... That's the whole point of boba tea. When we told them, they didn't even apologise for not telling us they were out of boba nor did they do anything about it. The food was mediocre but took forever to get to us. It wasn't even that busy that day. I am not happy with my experience here and will not be going back."}
{"text":"Wasn't sure what we were going to get when we got here because there was no one there on a Sunday afternoon but my boyfriend and I were pleasantly surprised with how good their food tasted!   Being from California, I am spoiled when it comes to food.  We've been on the hunt for a decent pho place since I moved to SC last October.  Finally I'm happy to have found this place but sadly it's 3 hours away.    Place is clean and the price is reasonable with the portion!  I've been to not very good Pho places in SC and NC where the cost is anywhere from 11 dollars to 15 dollars for a large and the bowl is the size of a kids meal.    My boyfriend got the large #1 combination Pho with a side of meatballs.  He absolutely loved his pho.  Says it's the best he's ever had.   I got the Hu Tieu and I'll be honest, I've had better in California but it was good enough for me.    Boyfriend says this is his new favorite pho place and that it's a must go to place when we visit Charlotte!   Staff was very nice as well.  Yes, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Pretty good vietnamese food. Tried the pho and also stirfried seafood egg noodles. Both pretty good. The rolls were decent as well. Takes a while to get the check but overall a good place to get vietnamese food"}
{"text":"My son just returned last week from a 2.5 excursion in SE Asia, including Cambodia and Vietnam. He loves Pho, so we were looking for something nearby for lunch on Sunday, 11/6/16. This place is hard to find in that it is behind other shops and you park at another restaurant and have to walk through a very desolate, spare little patio area and the signage is not adequate (it seems like you're going into the Nail Bar next door). However, now that we know where it is. We will be back; the service was friendly and the food was very fresh, well prepared and delicious. The teas were a bit too sweet and limeade too sour but the dishes each of us had were very fresh and good. Recommend; there isn't much on this side of town like this; a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Ahh Pho N'gon ....I'm so sorry to do this to you, because you were my first ROTD...but you are being downgraded.  After the wonderful Grand Opening specials were done, Pho N'gon just failed to wow me. With all the delicious cheaper Korean food nearby, I simply can't be bothered to eat here anymore.  Their pho is good (better than Pho Rex across the street), but the menu doesn't have a lot going on. Boring. Get some special dishes or something.  The service continues to be good and the place is really clean. But really, Pho N'gon is just average."}
{"text":"At first, I thought the world was against me. I tried to go to Pho Ngon two different times and they were closed. Once was when they switched to new management and then the second time was on a Thursday. But third time was definitely the charm. I liked it so much that I have been back within a week! And soon they will be opened 7 days away so I will no longer need to make sure what day of the week it is before getting my fix.   So I'm Vietnamese (which is why I'm very particular about the Vietnamese places I go to) and if you didn't know \"Ngon\" means good. So in short this place should \"Good Pho\" translated. 9/10 times though I go with someone who always wants pho. So I use this time to try other staples of Vietnamese cuisine that usually gets lost in the sauce.    Combination Vermicelli noodles was great! They really load it up with egg rolls, flavorful grilled pork, a skewer of shrimp and of course all of the fresh veggies. It was a huge beautiful portion. Then moving on is a Banh Xeo, it was a mix between fluffy and crispy which is exactly how mama should make it! It is basically this yellow pancake filled with bean sprouts and grilled pork. You take the lettuce leaf and take a piece of the banh xeo with the garnishes and you roll it up and dip into the fish sauce.   Then we got the combination sandwich, it had grilled pork, chicken and cuts of ham. The bread was crispy on the outside with a great meat to bread ratio, no skinny sorry sandwich here! Last but not least papaya salad, Vietnamese style. Which means it's marinated in fish sauce and is spicy with jerky on top! Definitely on the spicer side if you are not use to spicy things but not spicy compared to Thai/Laos/Cambodian style papaya salad.   And to drink I got a Da Chanh, which is fresh squeezed limeade and it was wonderful! I was bummed that I wanted an avocado shake but they were out of avocados.   The place was clean and the service was fine! I can't believe you are still reading and haven't gone to try this place yet!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious!!! I enjoyed the Pho here. Very clean and the staff is very friendly. I recommend this place for anyone who wants good vietnamese food and a good experience."}
{"text":"After a day at the ROM with my friends I was super hungry and super broke.... Pho to the rescue! I strayed from I usual Pho Hung (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/pho-hung-toronto) and opted for something in Korea Town.  First I ordered the cold shrimp rolls and to be honest they were meh. Next was the Pho soup, I wouldn't say the broth was bland but it certainly tasted different then any other Pho broth I have ever had. Their Pho is only available in \"Special\" (don't play with your testicles Marie and eat your soup...) and rare beef (mine is still mooing).  I am told the mens washroom has an off homage to soccer, but I'll let the boys explain it... I am glad I tried this place and it wasn't bad but I still like Pho Hung better."}
{"text":"Pho is good but the taste is different from visit to visit... But always delicious. One of the better broths in the city.  Service is quick and efficient but not friendly. Spring rolls and imperial rolls are bad (almost no filling and not tasty) I like to go there when I am in a rush.... For a good soup or a good plate of mixed grilled meats with rice."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on NYE and I was thoroughly impressed by the food and service.   Shortly after being seated the restaurant was suddenly full and the our server, of two servers total on the floor, handled this rush adeptly.   I got a medium-sized pho dac biet with a Vietnamese iced coffee and my fiancée got the bún with egg rolls.  My pho came with some of the freshest herbs and other accoutrements that went well with such a full, flavorful broth. I had just a bite of one of the egg rolls and enjoyed that a lot.  Do yourself a favor and swing by this place for some delicious and affordable Vietnamese cuisine."}
{"text":"Finally back to Pho Ngon, this time meeting a friend for lunch. As before, I went with the Pho Ga. It didn't take long before a very large bowl (the \"large\" must be the size of a swimming pool) arrived complete with chicken, noodles and all the fixings.  Broth was rich and smelled heavenly. There were plenty of noodles and a reasonable amount of thin sliced white meat chicken. After adding the requisite cilantro and basil and bean sprouts then squeezing the lime, I only needed to squirt sriracha and start the dive. Delicious."}
{"text":"This restaurant is run by the same people that owned the now defunct La Boiled Crawfish. The food served here is your run-of-the-mill Vietnamese food, however, it was terribly overpriced for the quality and portion you get. Every item on the food and drink menu was at least $2-$3 more expensive than your usual Vietnamese restaurant. $4 for two small goi cuon?! Robbery. $4 for a lackluster Thai Tea/Vietnamese coffee?! Pass. Above all else, what disappointed me most was the Banh Mi. The best thing about La Boiled Crawfish was their delicious Banh Mi, so I was excited to see that they offered it at their new establishment. Unfortunately, it wasn't anything like their old Banh Mi. Never mind that the sandwiches were way too expensive at $5.50, it was also much smaller, light on the meat, and taste-wise didn't compare to the one offered at their previous restaurant which I would happily pay $5.50 for.  The big positive about this restaurant is the staff. They were very polite, friendly, and helpful. The waitress was prompt with refilling our drinks, checked on our table frequently, and the food came out quickly. Unless I'm in the vicinity, I wouldn't go out of my way to come eat at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Pho dac biet medium  sized. Fresh spring rolls with sweet  tea. Not your typical meal on wheels! Damn Viet Cong! Always after me lucky  charms"}
{"text":"In town on vacation and man, it's cold outside! We wanted hot soup, so decided to come for the soup. So, so good. We got no. 15 (??) and the shrimp stir fry. We'll definitely be back next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"We went on a quiet night, but the food was hot and fresh and the service attentive.  This was a tucked away little place, but very clean and reasonable."}
{"text":"service was below average had to ask for water every time I wanted my glass filled don't like doing that . The rolls where below average as well. The soup was good but not great compared to other places I've tried it didn't impress me . I'm giving it 3 stars because it not expensive but it's more like a 2.5 for me. Another thing is they only take cash I can understand no credit cards but not debit just makes things inconvenient."}
