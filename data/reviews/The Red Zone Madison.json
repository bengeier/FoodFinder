{"text":"Great food all the way! Love it! Friday's fish tacos are some Madison's best. The staff and service are always friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Well, what do you expect from a local college bar? We went here with a conference group to do trivia. It was ok, but all of the questions were science-related so that wasn't fun at all. It seemed like everyone who came were big science nerds, which really didn't make me feel comfortable at all. I just don't feel super comfortable when there's a lot of nerdy scientists talking about random sciency stuff. Eww. The drink selection is ok, they have a couple single malts, though not many. And very few liqueurs and cordials, as expected. But it's reasonably cheap and reasonably close to stuff. They don't have a drink menu, so you have to ask them exactly how much each thing costs."}
{"text":"Watched the Badger game at the Red Zone on Saturday. Lots of tvs made viewing and talking with friends easy. Burgers and fries were surprisingly fast and remarkably delicious! I expected fast food, highly processed burger and greasy fries, but received a thick perfectly cooked (still pink in the center) burger and crisp fries with a nice amount of salt. Beer was cold and plentiful."}
{"text":"Game days? Fine. You're still better off at Luckys, Jordan's Big10 or sconnie if the band doesn't come through.  Not a game day? Don't even bother. It's too big for the amount of staff, bouncers power trip, the music at night is barely audible and the beer specials aren't enough to make it good. Every single time I come here I think to myself \"Why am I doing this again.\"   Halloween is a perfect example. Less than 1/3 full every year with all the unfriendly security company and bouncers.  If you can't keep people in a bar in Madison on Halloween? Something ain't right.  Save yourself and walk across the street and down to luckies or any of the other bars on regent."}
{"text":"Big spacious nice open area.  Great for hosting video game tournaments.i would not eat here again though. The shrimp basket was some of the worst bar food I have ever had"}
{"text":"This place is creepy, I don't know who would party here if it weren't game day. Ordered chicken tenders, took 40 mins (actually that's a lie, I'm still sitting here waiting) Bad food, bad service and bad ambiance."}
{"text":"This is purely a college gameday review.  My adult son and I visited here last weekend before heading into Camp Randall.  Typical game day crowd...and very crowded outside....but if you slipped inside there was plenty of space, good music and open bars for drinks.  Oh, and they had all the other games on plenty of TVs which is exactly what we wanted.  I would recommend it again on game day."}
{"text":"Recently stopped in for lunch. The new spicy turkey gyro is amazing, thanks Drew, perfectly prepared lunch."}
{"text":"They're open really early on game days so it makes for a good pre-camp randall stop. Prices are low and the fried cheese curds are satisfying. I wasn't into my brat though. If was too sweet and basically tasted like a giant breakfast sausage.  I don't know that I'd come here during a non-gameday drink before 11am occasion, but in that particular situation they acquit themselves well enough."}
{"text":"What's not to love about this place?! It's a perfect game day spot as well as lunch or dinner out. I've always been greeted with a smile by staff, even when they're really busy. The food always exceeds my expectations, not just your regular bar food. Their music venue is also one of the best in Madison!"}
