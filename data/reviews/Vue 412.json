{"text":"I chose this restaurant for the reunion of my girlfriend and i after five months apart- and I couldn't have picked better! The food was very good though portions were large, the view was spectacular, and the staff were incredibly kind and respectful.  We shared the hummus appetizer, which was very good.  the bread and chips for the hummus were amazing.  I then ordered the scallops, which were very good, and my girlfriend ordered the chicken alfredo which was delicious.  Even though we showed up 45 minutes early, they still accommodated us and gave us a gorgeous table by the window.  I did mention in the reservation that it was a reunion and every staff member was very sweet about it.  The manager was the sweetest- after we finished our meal we sat in the exit waiting to leave and he came up to us, brought us back to the window and took pictures of us in front of the gorgeous view of Pittsburgh.  It was very special for a manager to take such a personal interest in a customer, or pair of customers.  It was, overall, an incredibly romantic spot.  I wouldn't change a thing."}
{"text":"While the food is amazing here, we can also say the same about the service! Nate is half the reason we keep coming back!! He truly makes the dinning experience unforgettable with his quirky/enthusiastic personality and always adds a personal touch to our drink requests. He's always ensuring that our food comes out flawless and makes us feel like we are his #1 customers. We absolutely love it here and would 100% recommend it! It's especially great for larger groups who want to get an amazing view of the entire city too!!"}
{"text":"Great view of downtown Pittsburgh and Heinz Field.   Strawberry salad with chicken at lunch time was very good.   Reasonable prices for the location.  Attentive service.  Restrooms are not handicap accessible."}
{"text":"Overall a terrible experience - we didn't even stay to eat. I gave it 2 stars because the view is great. I made a reservation for 8 & when we got there we were told it would be a short wait. Almost an hour later we still weren't seated. The hostess apologized but didn't really seem to care. Once we were finally seated the waiter told us some of the menu items we wanted were unavailable. At that point we left and had an amazing dinner at Altius instead."}
{"text":"I give the view 4 stars. We rode the incline up and it was a short walk to the restaurant. We arrived at 1pm and the two of us were seated by the window, which was nice.   I give the food 2 stars. I had a flatbread (recommended by the waitress) and my husband had the Cuban sandwich. Both were very mediocre. Edible, but certainly nothing I would purchase again. I would have been much more pleased with chipotle, had one been available. The salads and burgers and I saw coming out of the kitchen didn't look appetizing and I saw one man salting his burger, which is never a good sign.  Service was also mediocre.   I have no idea why this place has 4 stars on Yelp.  Would I come back? No."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. My boyfriend and I arrived at 9:20 on a Friday evening after traveling from Washington, D.C. We were greeted by the hostess who asked if we had a reservation and we replied no. She then quickly said well we don't have any seats by the window, however we could clearly see a two person table directly next to the window. We told her that was fine, we would take anything (we were starving after driving 5 hours). She told us to wait while she checked and came back to tell us the kitchen closed and we could not be seated. Immediately after she greeted the woman behind us who said I have a 9:30 reservation and was promptly seated. How could that be if the kitchen was closed? As someone who was a waitress for years I know best practice is to seat your customer and the kitchen does not close 40 minutes early! Awful. Will never return."}
{"text":"Average food, especially for the higher prices. View was really nice, though. Wouldn't recommend to someone looking to eat on My. Washington though."}
{"text":"We were visiting Pittsburgh with the kids and rode the incline to get a view of the city. It was lunch time and we were hoping to eat lunch on Mt Washington as a family before heading back. Other restaurants would not serve us with our young children.   When I came to Vue 412, I asked the manager if they would serve us and he said \"they would be honored\". This won me over. But the great hospitality continued throughout our entire experience. The manager came by multiple times to express his gratitude for our having lunch with them and asked how everything was.   The food was good. I felt it was a bit pricey for what I got, but the friendliness of the entire staff made up for this in my mind."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Vue 412 and it's an Awesome restaurant!!' The food is to die for and the staff is top notch!!! The owner helped us decide what to order and he was right.....yummy Duck. The chef talks to everybody and even served us our dinner. I highly recommend this place!  We will definitely return! D Manna"}
{"text":"Ate here with the wife a few days ago. I really think the Yelp rating should be higher.  Made reservations for 6:30.  We were led to our table immediately upon walking in at 6:25. The table was against the window side of the restaurant on the open air deck. That's one of the best views in the city.  Could see all 3 rivers and surrounding area.  The food was very, very good and the prices were reasonable. Best I've had in quite awhile. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"$9 for a salad that consisted of lettuce a few pieces of tomato they should be ashamed.  The waitress forgot to put in my order. Good way to ruin my anniversary \"brunch\" which was really just lunch.  Won't be back the vue is not worth it."}
{"text":"Very nice place with a beautiful view. Food and service was excellent. We would definitely return to this place!"}
{"text":"Mr. Roman, thank you for getting back to me. Yes it was our first time as I just moved to Pittsburgh and had family visiting. I understand the pricing but the mussels definitely weren't worth the $19 as there was nothing to them. Also they forgot to make my boyfriends dinner and the waiter said he would take care of it but we paid for it. We didn't want to complain because we did have a nice time and we will try you again. Also we have no problem paying the prices nor do we expect a restaurant with that view to not be more than normal but portion size and timing of everything wasn't what we expected. We spent over 3hrs there. I work in the service industry so I understand what it takes to work out the kinks in a new establishment so we will be back to see how you grow. Thank you and your staff for making it fun."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service. Best view in town! Went for my Mother's birthday and couldn't asked for a better experience."}
{"text":"I think Vue 412 will only continue getting better. I think there were some problems when they were first settling in (I don't think they've been around too too long.) But this place is worth a visit now!  The view, obviously, is great. I had a table right beside the window (I came on a weekday evening, and it was very slow.) And you can see ALL of the city. It's gorgeous.  The food is good.They have a nice variety of things, and it's all done very well. Dessert is a must!!!   The only negative part about the place is the decor. It's not very clean or modern inside. I feel like they could have had a good opportunity to really make this place sharp, but it's not. The pictures online look better than the place actually does. This isn't a dealbreaker necessarily, but it's worth noting.  All in all, if you're looking for somewhere nice to take an out-of-towner or just want a nice date night, Vue 412 is perfect"}
{"text":"In town on business and stopped in for dinner. It was delicious! I had the pork loin and it was on of the best I have had. The asparagus was also very good. It has a great view over the city and rivers. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Terrible experience over the weekend when my family went for lunch.  We were seated by the hostess. After waiting 15-20 min for a server to come give us menus/wait on us, I had to go to the hostess and request them.  She gave the wrong ones (dinner).   Another 15-20 minutes pass and we have to ask again if we have a server...  After ordering, took at least an hour to get our food.  Out of 7 meals, only one was properly prepared (burnt veggie burger, missing/wrong ingredients, brown lettuce, wrong orders).  Only received drink refills when we questioned about where our food was.  Waitress was nice but absent. Despite the great views, I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I won't bury the lead - we will go back to Vue 412.  First time diners and the evening started with a nice greeting and table by the window. As it is on Mt. Washington the \"Vue\". Is great.  Our waiter, Nathan was fabulous. He described the specials and allowed us to order one course at a time.  The Bada Bing Shrimp was great. Very tangy and not overly breaded. And fairly large pieces of shrimp.  A test for us is always what the wait staff do with used silverware. Ours was replaced after each course.  The bread was warm (another test) and dipping oil was great. Infused (hate that word) with sun dried tomatoes.  We both ordered Chicken Picatta with artichokes.  Very good. Cream sauce was flavorful but not too heavy. Also, served hot.  The grand finale was peanut butter creme brulee.  Fabulous.  Overall a wonderful date night and we will be back."}
{"text":"I had a bad feeling about this the moment we sat down.  We went to Vue412 for lunch this past Saturday.  We had reserved a table for 12.  None of us had ever eaten at this restaurant, so I checked out their menu offerings online a day or so prior.  They actually had a few menus listed on their website.  A standard dinner offering (which also included sandwiches that had been listed as \"lunch only\"), a Friday-Sunday lunch menu and a couple of banquet menus.  So, of course, I was expecting to be presented with the weekend lunch menu as advertised...  As we were seated, we were presented with the standard dinner menu (full priced entrées, of course) instead of the more reasonably appointed lunch selections.    Well, no problem, as the dinner menu did include a selection of lunch sandwiches (see above)...  The waitress greeted us and then proceeded to explain that all of the dinner selections from the menu were available to order, but that the sandwiches on the menu were not available for this particular lunch...  She then proceeded to describe an alternate stable of sandwiches that were being prepared for the day.  So, the present menu was rendered rather useless unless we really were set on the $38 Filet for our quaint luncheon.  I will expand on the quality and value of the food momentarily.  The next item I need to take issue with was the general knowledge of the wait staff.  Let me first preface this by saying that our waitress was very polite and even patient with our larger party.  She even went the extra step to bring some extra fries out to the kids at the table and was kind enough to accommodate one of our more picky youngsters.  This was the key aspect which earned star #2 of my review.  But.... Every time we asked a question regarding an item on, or in most cases NOT on the menu, we were presented with an \"I'm not sure, let me check with the kitchen.\"  Now, I'm nothing if not realistic, and I realize that this is not out of the ordinary, but it seemed that most every question no matter how simple (\"Do you have American cheese?\") was responded to in this manner.  Also, through the meal, it felt almost as if she was overwhelmingly busy with tables even though we were the only party in this section of the restaurant.  The food quality was above average.  I could tell that the ingredients to each of the items ordered were carefully selected and of high quality.  But, again, I do feel that dinner pricing for lunch fare is a bit egregious.  I ordered a steak sandwich (again, not on any of the advertised menus), and they must have known that I am trying to really watch my caloric intake as it included about 2oz. of the steak trimmings from their butchered entrée cuts.  Again, I'm realistic, its a fancy restaurant, I wasn't expecting the Jumbo Special from Uncle Sam's (awesome steak sandwiches).  Now, my wife decided to try the Mediterranean Salad: celery, cucumber, chickpeas, pepperoncini, black olives, grape tomatoes, feta, grilled flatbread and an oregano vinaigrette (actual menu description).  The presentation of the salad was very pleasing.  A large bed of greens with some flatbread wedges nested on top (one of which fell to the ground as the waitress was serving it.  Not replaced, but I digress).  As she dug into the salad, she concluded that substance did not hold priority to presentation.  3 black olives, 3 grape tomatoes (halved so that there was an illusion of 6), and the bare minimum of feta cheese allowable with still being able to claimed feta cheese on the menu description.  Now today's economy has been tough, and I am sure they are simply trying to control costs, but for $18, I would assume that a few extra olives from the can and another tablespoon or two of feta cheese wouldn't cut too deeply into the profit margin of this item.  But, hey, everything was tasty.  One of the other diners ordered the steak salad, and we were notified that they were out of mesculn, but could substitute spinach or romaine... at 1:30 on a Saturday... tough luck, eh dinner crowd?  Although I did not partake, I am told that the desserts were fantastic...  Sufficed to say, I did not feel that we really got much bang for our buck on this outing.  Who knows, maybe I am just revealing myself as an uncivilized, low cultured simpleton.  But, I do know that I will most likely not be making a return trip to this establishment.  The view was great, but I feel that it has been way overvalued in the experience.  The hiccups in the logistics of the menu and the service could certainly be attributed to growing pains, but for these prices, there is not much margin for these types of issues.  I read a previous review about a similar experience on New Year's.  It would seem that busy or slow, this place has some wrinkles to iron out.  At these prices, one would be much better served to head to the Lemont, Monterey Bay or one of the other fine dining establishments on Mt. Washington."}
{"text":"The Vues were incredible! Took my elderly aunts visiting from out of town to this restaurant and we had a very pleasant experience. The filet mignon and Veal dishes are amazing! Place has 3 separate floors all with very accessible views of the city! Great food! Great Service!"}
{"text":"We had a guest come in from out of state.  We wanted to take her to a place with good food and a nice ambiance. We used to LOVE Tin Angel. But,  Vue412 absolutely DID NOT disappoint either!  Very friendly staf f. Gorgeous view of the Point. I had the Shrimp ala Ramone and it was very good.  Others had the Veal Marsala and Veal Parmigiana which were both delightful.  Thank you for an awesome experience! We will most certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Wow - totally impressed with this restaurant - the ambiance was perfect - good beer list - only had apps but the hummus and Bada bing shrimp were delicious.  The views from the bar were amazing - JJ em was the most gracious of hosts and the service of Nate was super attentive and superior.  Will certainly come back each time I come to town!!!!"}
{"text":"We arrived on a weekday without a reservation and quickly got a seat. The staff was extremely friendly.  The view was perfect for us as we are from out of town and loved to see Pittsburgh from Mount Washington.  The Chef was very good and passionate about his food. We were with a few internationals and he brought out some of food to make them feel at home. My steak was cooked exactly as specified.   I would absolutely recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Ate there 3 times already. Everything wonderful and prices reasonable. Great friendly people and service. Much needed addition to Grandview Avenue dining scene."}
{"text":"Great view! Food mediocre. I ordered a salad with shrimp. The lettuce was brown, and the shrimp was frozen and obviously just thawed. My friend ordered the Burg burger, and instead of the pork belly, as advertised, he got four French fries on the burger. He did get three strips of pork belly when he questioned the substitution. The service was very good. The wait staff runs up and down three flights of stairs. I would recommend drinks and an appetizer, and eat your main meal elsewhere."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this restaurant only has 3 1/2 stars, and I am a foodie. We went back and forth about whether to even give it a shot, because of the overall rating, but it was excellent. This is our first time visiting Pittsburgh, and we decided to ride the Duquesne Incline to see the skyline and the rivers from above.  Once we stood in line at the bottom, rode up, and did some observing we didn't feel ready to turn around and go back down, so we checked yelp, and other restaurants seemed to either be three dollar signs or poorly rated (or both), so we decided to give two dollar signs and average reviews a shot. The views from this restaurant are incredible. The salad and entrée portions were small (you probably won't have leftovers), but plenty filling and very delicious. The desserts are huge, and the tiramisu stood out as especially good. I think I've only had better tiramisu twice before, and one of those times was in Venice. Our waitress was really kind and funny, and very sweet with our daughter. It was pricey (pricier than we ever go out for), but I have to imagine that the real estate up there is very expensive! It was definitely worth the price for a special occasion, and the food and view made it an experience, not just a meal."}
{"text":"Overall very good experience. There is a nice variety on the menu and the food was really good. We had the Crab & Corn dip and Aroncini as appetizers and liked both; they were nicely portioned, and the Aroncini was cooked perfectly and was delicious. We both opted for a seafood dish that had shrimp, scallops, and lump crab and were not disappointed. Service was good and Steve, the bar manager, was great. We sat downstairs where the bar is, which provided a relaxing and casual atmosphere; a little less formal than the main dining room, which we liked. Would recommend and do plan to return."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here to celebrate our anniversary and boy am I glad we chose this restaurant.  The meal was delicious and the service was impeccable.  The entire wait staff was so friendly and professional.  The general manger was friendly and genuine.  All in all we had a great experience at Vue 412 and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Well after all the reviews, we decided to make our own mind up and have dinner.  I hate to say that we were not impressed.  From waiting almost 45 minutes for our table, to the bartender being our waiter, food selections not available, poor quality of food and then desert that tasted more like stuffed shells than cannoli the only thing positive I can say is that nathan made the whole evening bearable and there is a lovely view if you get a window seat.    Another side note....parents, if you are paying top dollar for food and you are going to bring babies and toddlers out to eat please take some advise, learn how to control your kids.  That being said screaming babies and uncontrolled kids should be removed so that others can enjoy their dinners that they are paying good money for.    I really think Vue 412 could be a wonderful place if they get their act together.  Good quality food and service.  That's what counts!  Best wishes."}
{"text":"Best spot on Mt Washington The old Tin Angel is transformed. It's updated, bright and the view..... New owner knows what he's doing. 1st Class service. Let the tradition continue... At Vue 412!"}
{"text":"This was a great find! We took the incline up and were just looking for a drink at the top. We wandered in to Vue 412 and found an amazing view of the Pittsburgh skyline and a nice vibe. They had good happy hour specials and everyone there was really friendly. Good drinks, good food... we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First time here. Good was well prepared with decent portions. Husband had the filet that melted in your mouth. The sea bass was perfectly prepared. Wait staff were knowledgable and attentive without being overbearing. Ask for Adam. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible. 20 minutes for menus, 55 minutes for food after ordering. Major issues with each dish (burned, missing ingredients, brown lettuce). Avoid this place. Tourist trap."}
{"text":"This was hard to grade because elements were exceptional and elements were just OK.  First, the positive:  - The view, that's why you're here and it doesn't let you down. Spectacular view where you find yourself staring out the window at nothing in particular; it's just stunning!  - The service was near the best of any experience I've had, anywhere. From the time we arrived, through the initial bar service, to the manager and chef checking in; it was a welcoming experience without being overly bearing. Some higher end services like an initial sample from the chef and a soup sampling for me while my dining guest was having a salad and I had nothing...those were subtle but welcome additions to the experience.  The cons:  - The food was generally inconsistent. Our flatbread appetizer was fantastic, the home made pizza dough was very good and the flavor of the pizza was very good. On the other hand, we had a risotto appetizer that was fried and served in marinara that wasn't horrible, it just felt and tasted like something you would get at a good bar or chain restaurant...not fine dining. The inconsistency continued for the main course. My two sides were excellent but then the sear on my scallops, that had been done perfectly, had lost it's crunch by the time the dish reached the table and they were served on a bed of spinach that generally lacked flavor.  - Let's face it, you're here for the view. Aside from that, the aesthetics of the restaurant were somewhat dated. The downstairs bar is very pretty but other elements, like lighting fixtures and butcher paper on the white linen table clothes, didn't seem to fit.  - Generally, the menu lacked creativity. Main courses were served with traditional sides prepared in a traditional way. For a fine dining experience, I'm hoping to feel the chef's personality coming through the dishes.  Ultimately, I would love to give the place another try. The food was good enough that I'd like to try other dishes. With a bit of polishing, this could be a top-tier experience. In the mean time, it's an above average food experience, with exceptional service and a world class view."}
{"text":"I hosted my daughter's 21st birthday party at Vue 412 and everything was perfect!  We held the party in a private room upstairs which has an enclosed deck with a beautiful view and more than enough space for the 16 of us in the main room.  (The space would accommodate more if people were dining on the deck and plus there was another small room up there that we didn't use). The room had everything we needed including its own kitchenette/bar area, a flat screen TV, a pulldown screen to project our slideshow, and restrooms right outside the door.   There are three levels of pre-order buffet categories for large groups, each with many options from which to select entrees and sides. Having this pre-ordered fixed menu was so convenient and helped me predict the price as well. We could bring our own wine or order from their bar. They provided a custom birthday cake. All the food was delicious!   And the service was fantastic! The event coordinator, Jackie, is super sweet and helpful; the restaurant manager, Joe, was very nice and came up to meet me as I was decorating and then again to say a few words of welcome to our group; Nate was very helpful in helping me get the room set up between trying to take care of his lunch crowd; our waitresses, Sabrina and Dana, were awesome -- very nice, professional, and gave us great service.  I highly recommend Vue 412 for special occasions such as ours! It couldn't have gone better!"}
{"text":"Dined at Vue 412 last night and left a bit underwhelmed. Very friendly staff which was the best part of the experience. Obviously a terrific view which our party enjoyed. Food was mixed, there were six of us. The prime rib was a hit, as was the spaghetti squash. The pasta dishes were just OK. Scallops were good. I had the halibut special which was small and a bit overcooked. Wasn't very good. The dinners were served two at a time with an overly long time between the servings. Seemed like several minutes between servings which was awkward. Prices were fairly reasonable given the locale.  Wouldn't be in a hurry to go back, but given how friendly the staff was might give another shot."}
{"text":"They ran out of everything but excuses and apologies!!!!   A party of 7 people for a birthday celebration turned into sheer disappointment.  We wanted to start the evening with a bottle of champagne.....they were out of champagne.  We asked for bread with the salad......they were out of bread.  Next, an order of red and white wine for the table.....they were out of the red wine we ordered.   The entrees were cold and presented with different sides than those listed on the menu.    After they were removed for reheating, the dinners came back on a small plate after the rest of the table had already finished eating with what looked like frozen bagged vegetables on the side.  When we questioned this, we were then served a plate of cold smashed potatoes.  There were several people walking around but only one waitress to handle the entire dining room.  The manager appeared to remain outside at the front door, avoiding any involvement with the operation. We heard nothing but apologies the entire evening.  We felt like we were in a Saturday Night Live skit!  And how did they remedy this?  More apologies.  I could go on, but suffice is to say, don't waste your time.  There are several other restaurants which offer a great view with great food and great service without apologies and excuses."}
{"text":"I recently stopped here for lunch after riding the nearby incline. Though we arrived shortly before they stopped serving lunch we were seated and served from the lunch menu. The burgers were to die for and the desserts were absolutely amazing. The wait staff were all very friendly despite the challenges of serving in a three story restaurant with a tight floor plan. There was an entire wall of windows which provided an astounding view of the downtown. I would highly recommend Vue 412 for a nice lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and awesome attention by hostess, server and even the Chef came out to make sure our food tasted good. The view is spectacular. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"We stopped here after riding the incline for drinks and desserts. It took a while for someone to come to the door to get us and they acted like there wasn't much room for us even though the downstairs was empty. The wine was great and the desserts were too but they took a very long time to come out.   Our server was friendly and the atmosphere was dark, quiet, and classy. Definitely a great view."}
{"text":"We were seated right away for our reservation. The hostess and server were both friendly and efficient. Portions were excellent and the food was overall very good to excellent.The osso buco cuts were huge; the sea scallops were big and fresh. The view is of course outstanding. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Came to do the Duquesne Incline and this restaurant is few doors down. Apparently  President Bill Clinton has visited here as well. Food was very tasty and I had the creme brûlée for dessert. They do have a lunch menu that ends at 3:00 pm. which is less pricey than their dinner menu.  But of course the view is better at night with the city lights. There's a bar downstairs which is where people stop to have a drink and go. Upstairs is the formal dining room."}
{"text":"As soon as my boyfriend and I took our first bites, we knew we would be coming back! We chose not to sit right next to a window because it was so cold but we were still able to see the view without having to be so close, which we loved. Our waitress was very attentive, when she first greeted us, she asked if we were celebrating anything. We told her our anniversary, thinking she was just making conversation, but after our meal she brought us a glass of cotton candy to celebrate! It was totally unexpected but so appreciated! The whole meal was amazing and worth every penny. Definitely would be coming back for another special occasion!"}
{"text":"Visited view for our 28th anniversary on September 24 2016. We were promptly greeted and seated beside the window with great views of the city. We ordered the spicy shrimp appetitizer which was fantastic. My wife had the salmon and I ordered the crabcakes. Both meals were outstanding and our server was great. The only negative I can say of the evening was the person who greeted us at the door was sloppy and her appearance better suited for a shot and beer joint, but it was all uphill after that. Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"View was nice. Waiter (Rob) was fantastic. The butternut squash ravioli was the best dish at our table, flavorful and cooked well. The gnocchi was a little gummy but the vodka cream sauce was very good.  The spaghetti and meatballs were awful, the pasta was overcooked, the sauce was very bland, and the meatballs were heavy and rock like.   The service was very quick and our waiter was patient and personable. The view of the city was nice but the windows were dirty which made taking a decent picture impossible. The music was at just the right level for conversation but the dining room did get quite noisy as it filled in.  I would probably go back to try lunch or dessert but would not have dinner again."}
{"text":"Amazing food, service, and view! Lonnie and chef Cam were the best! Chef Cam came out to check on us. Made adjustments for our lower carb diet, older person in our party and our fun group. Definitely will be back when we want a special dinner. Best food on Mt. Washington that we have tried so far."}
{"text":"Excellent service, food and cocktails!  This is one of the three best fine-dining restaurants with a city view on Mt. Washington, along with Altius and Monterey Bay."}
{"text":"Visited on Valentine's day and I was disappointed. I read some great reviews on yelp but was not satisfied with the food or decor of the place. Its interior could use a major make over. It's like the place is stuck in the 80's. New interior design is in order. The food was average as nothing stood out. It was pretty foggy on this night so the views were not as speculator as it would have been. All in all good service, average food, and a major interior design update needed"}
{"text":"This restaurant has become my new favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh! This past weekend I and my family had the opportunity of meeting the manager Joe and 2 of his staff Dana and Chris. This restaurant has arguably one of the finest views of the city of Pittsburgh that there is,  and it is made better still by the kindness and attentiveness of Joe and his team. We so enjoyed the restaurant on Saturday that we came back again on Sunday!!!. You will want to try the mussels, and the shrimp appetizer and the tiramisu was one of the best we've had, ever. Thank you Joe Dana and Chris for making this weekend one of the best we've had in some time, and we look forward to returning to your awesome restaurant on our next trip back into your beautiful city!"}
{"text":"Amazing View, Amazing Food, Amazing Service!  My boyfriend and I visited Vue 412 on a Tuesday evening for his birthday. I had made a reservation a week prior and let them know we would be celebrating his birthday.   When we arrived, our table was ready for us, nicely seated on the second floor next to the window. Our server Sabrina happily greeted us and started us off with bread. We placed drink orders. I had a glass of wine and my boyfriend had a signature fall cocktail. Sabrina took her time making the drink perfectly! As we browsing the menu, the manager Joe came over to chat with us. Joe was so awesome to talk to. He really seemed to be genuinely interested in the guests that came to his restaurant. We also were able to get to know him and his experience working at Vue412 just by chatting with him, not to mention he was funny and gave great free compliments! Joe made sure to let everyone in the restaurant know it was my boyfriend's birthday and made sure that the food and service was exceptional.  Our appetizers: Bada Bing Shrimp & Greens & Beans  Our Meals: Tortelacci & Parmesean Chicken AMAZING! The portions were plenty and the flavors were delicious! I actually couldn't finish the Greens & Beans because I wanted to have room for my entre. I had plenty of leftovers to take for lunch the next day. The Gnocci served with my Parmeasean Chicken was cooked perfectly. With every bite, everything was more delicious.   After our food, Sabrina and the staff sang happy birthday with a cotton candy sparkler glass & complimentary lemon drop shots. She also cut the cake I had brought along. As if she hadn't done enough already, Sabrina went out of her way to unlock the upstairs patio to make sure my boyfriend and I could get a picture with the best view in the house. She took multiple photos and really made us feel like celebrities!  My boyfriend said he couldn't have asked for a more perfect night. Of course we came for the view, and the food was sensational.  (Currently craving more Greens & Beans! MMMMM!) But we will definitely be returning soon because of the overall experience we had with the staff at Vue412. Thank you for making it a night to remember!"}
{"text":"Vue 412 is certainly very good, and like the other restaurants in the area, the View of 412 is excellent. You simply won't go wrong by stopping in here.  Everyone we interacted with was genuinely friendly and helpful.  While dressed up fairly nice, the overall building architecture is older, and it doesn't seem much has been done with the walls, ceiling, or general infrastructure. Everything is a little dated, and due to the common open-air nature of a lot of these restaurants, a couple flies were buzzing around. I'm particular sensitive to that, but my diner partner didn't notice or mind.  The menu was relatively small, which I like. They should remove or relocate their lunch menu -- they mention much less expensive sandwiches that are unavailable after 3pm.  The food itself was very good. The presentation was great, the flavors were good. We had the beans and greens, which was simple but good. We also had the caprese salad which was fine, but the tomatoes weren't very tasty and the balsamic seemed thick and over reduced. The beet salad was great.  The salmon was cooked nicely and was a decent portion.  The Pork Osso Bucco was huge, falling off the bone, and delicious. It was served with a red sauce over a nice yellow garlic polenta. The dish was really solid, and the portion size was immense. Delicious!  The main course was a little slow coming out, despite having appetizers first, which came out lightning fast.  The cocktails were good, but tasted watered down.  Our server was very friendly, full of helpful recommendations, and genuinely wanted to ensure we had the best possible time while we were there.  I'm rounding up to 4 stars for this review, despite some obvious problems, the food, service, and view is what this place is about. I'll attach a picture of the view from my seat."}
{"text":"I had an amazing experience at Vue 412.  The service was amazing and very attentive.  The food was incredible, all very elegantly prepared and tasted fantastic.  The view is obviously the crown jewel and there's really no table with a bad view.  We sat by a window.  Great menu with a variety, my wife is vegetarian and there were many options for her.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I came here for restaurant week and had a 7:30pm reservation with another couple for a double-date.  We were seated downstairs which is not as nice as the other floors because it sort of had a basement vibe. The view, though, is amazing.  It seems they were understaffed and the staff got overwhelmed by the number of guests as we had to wait a long time for food.  I did not see any staff just hanging around and wasting time-- they were definitely working hard.  The appetizers took about 30-40 minutes to come out and they didn't all come out together so we ended up sharing as they arrived.  I got the mussels and the sauce that it was in was spicy and warm, but the sausage that was in it was cold...   Then we waited another 45 minutes for the main course to come out and it must have been sitting out because it was cold so I didn't really enjoy it.  Dessert only took about 10 minutes to come out because they were pre-prepared, even the creme brulee, which I don't think should ever be pre-prepared.  Overall, I did not enjoy my food because it was cold but I didn't send it back because I felt bad for the waitstaff.   During the time we were there, the waitstaff apologized several times to other patrons at the bar because of how long they waited.  I did not notice any turnover in the tables downstairs... basically everyone downstairs waited a long time for food.  We left the restaurant around 9:30...  Overall, I was very disappointed with the food.  They do have a lot of potential and perhaps they're much better when there are fewer guests, but I would not recommend them based on my experience."}
{"text":"I came to Vue 412 this morning for Mother's Day brunch with my parents. We had a reservation and were there a tad early. My mom and I checked in with the hostess and she mumbled something about her husband would seat us. But dude never came. We didn't care much because my dad was on his way but when he got there maybe 10 minutes later, we still weren't seated. People just looked at us and moved along. So. Okay.   So we get seated and wait a good while for the waiter. We are there for brunch and don't see brunch buffet anywhere. They sit us on the lowest level of the restaurant. There are three floors. So we are waiting for someone to take drink orders and I notice my moms water glass already has lipstick smudged all over it. Gross. And one of the coffee cups was also dirty. Some of the silverware wasn't washed that well either. Waiter finally comes, takes our drink orders and hustles off. We are told brunch is on the third floor. Which seems weird as hell.   We have to traipse up two big flights of stairs to this top level where they only seat parties of like 15 to get to this fairly mediocre brunch buffet. The food, while having lots of choices, wasn't amazing. You're definitely paying for the view. So we had to wait in a line to get food, seemed a bit disorganized. And had to go balance our plates while we walked back down various stairways while trying not to bump into people. My mom doesn't have great knees. This was tough.   Our food is cold by time we get downstairs. The coffee we ordered is also cold because waiter must've poured it while we were long gone. So we ate. I forgot to ask for syrup and at first the waiter just told me I'd have to walk back upstairs with my plate to get it but he graciously grabbed it for me. Points for him. For that.   Water wasn't refilled much even when I asked. The coffee never got that hot when refilled. My dad tried to use a Just Pay Half deal and they wouldn't accept it since it was a brunch or something. So now we have to come back even though we don't really want to. The buffet was no better than a glorified hotel brunch to me. I don't know. Got a weird vibe from the place. Weird service. Saw some ants crawling around. Just wasn't fully what you hope for in terms of a nice breakfast for mom.   Anyway. That's my review."}
{"text":"My friends and I had a very disappointing experience at Vue 412 lastnight. From the moment we walked in the door to the minute we left, terrible.  Let's start with when we were first seated, the waiter literally stood in front of my chair so I could not sit down for a solid 2 minutes to join the rest of my party. Move it, bud! We then proceeded to attempt to order a bottle of wine, however, every single bottle we wanted they were \"out\" of until the 4th try. We actually thought they were kidding.  Moving on to the food... Our salads came out after our meals, which was 30 minutes after ordering them. The lemon basil vinaigrette was nothing short of being ranch dressing and for $9, the portion was really small. It was white and creamy. Nothing lemon, basil, or vinaigrette about it. None of my party wanted our salads after our meals. The manager did remove the salads from our checks, which was the right thing to do, but I sent mine back all together. My gnocchi with Italian sausage arrived to the table cold, however, the remainder of my partied food was warm. Once reheated, it was pretty good but again, a really small portion  One of my friends has a gluten allergy, so she asked for a side of fries with her meal (fries are on the menu). Her food arrived 5 minutes after everyone else's and was missing the fries. When she asked the cook, who delivered her meal without the fries, he asked like he was doing her SUCH a huge favor by throwing some fries in the fryer since they don't typically serve them. I didn't understand since again, fries are on the menu.  To top the night off, when I went to use the restroom, the stall was out of toilet paper and the trash can overflowing. That was the icing to the cake.  The view at Vue 412 is unbeatable, but you can get the same view with a better meal and service at Monterrey Bay or one of the other better restaurants on Mt Washington. The inside of the restaurant is very out dated and the outside looks like a night club.  Trying to make up for the horrible experience we had, the manager gave us 3 free desserts to try, which I did really appreciate. The lemon cello cake was delicious and the only reason I am giving this review a 2 star. I am glad I tried Vue 412, however, I don't think I'll return."}
{"text":"The first thing you notice about this place is the view. Glass walls run the length of the three floors overlooking Point State Park, Rivers Casino and the ball parks. Once we were seated we had a wonderfully attentive waitress who took our drink orders and told us about the specials. Our group ordered the filet, lamb chops and short ribs. We also had the spinach, mashed potatoes and green bean sides. The menu didn't indicate that the entrees came with a starch and a veggie so we could have skipped the extra sides.  We all enjoyed our entrees immensely. We then ordered the creme brûlée and coconut cream pie for dessert which were mediocre at best. Both lacked any real flavor and were disappointing after the great entrees and sides.   Accolades for the wine list, entrees and sides.  Thumbs down for the desserts. But overall check this place out."}
{"text":"My parents and I are from outside of Pittsburgh and went to the Tin Angel (former restaurant here) for special occasions. It was my parents' 40th anniversary, and they wanted to be in the same place where they had so many fond memories -- and the best view! They were glad they could get a reservation easily for the time they wanted and were really happy with how clean and well run the restaurant is. The staff really made their anniversary special with great presentation (sparklers!). And they said their food was great -- filet, salmon, asparagus, potatoes, chocolate cake. They were really pleased and said how nice everyone was and how hard they were working. My dad texted me a photo of the view. Can't wait to go when I'm in town!"}
{"text":"They have the best butternut squash ravioli I've ever had! Our waiter was super friendly and food was delicious! Will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"The Vue burgers was the best burger I have had in a long time. The view from the dining area is awesome. The manager is very friendly!"}
{"text":"Had a real nice time celebrating our 27 year anniversary. Duck Pate is so full of flavor. Orange Manhattan cocktail is delish. We were there on a weeknight and not busy so the chef came out and talked with us a couple times which was nice."}
{"text":"We recently had our department Christmas dinner here with a dozen people or so. They set us up in the bar area, which was great, allowing us to all have a great view of the City while we dined. Our food was excellent (no complaints from 13 people). Everyone was happy with the diverse menu. Our server (Dana) was awesome...she handled our entire group amazingly...without a hitch. Thank You to her. The Bartender & Staff were great...and tremendously accommodating. The Manager came down to introduce himself & thank us for choosing the venue, which was a kind gesture and appreciated. A perfect place for our department Dinner."}
{"text":"This place was mediocre. Not worth how expensive it is. Traveled from out of town and this place was suggested. Waiter was rude and food was gross and over priced."}
{"text":"What an amazing experience we had at Vue 412! My husband and I certainly picked the perfect place for superb dining with beautiful surroundings. We were seated at the window so we had a fantastic view from atop Mt Washington.  The servers were friendly. We were given an orange bread with fig compote. It was savory and a great way to start.  I had the tomato salad and my husband had the Moroccan Tomato soup. Both were flavored just right.  We were given a savory sorbet to cleanse the palate before our main meals. Again, delicious. For our main meals I got the porkchop dinner and he got the chicken Alfredo. Mine was delicious and his was beyond heavenly. The best chicken Alfredo either of us have ever eaten.  Now, the desserts sounded so tempting that we each got one and shared. The poached pear was seasoned perfectly and the Black Forest custard was creamy and very tasty. The Chef, Miko (spelling?), visited each table and explained how the dishes were prepared. He has only been there 2 weeks and you can see the passion he has for preparing amazing food. He worked in Japan and Germany for many years perfecting his craft. He incorporates flavors from his past experiences, pays homage to the region's history, and does this all wrapped up in amazing French style cooking. Sous chef, Sean, develops amazing hot and cold soups. You have to check this place out! The best part of his mission is to make delicious food that is affordable for the enjoyment of locals and visitors alike.  The atmosphere is laid back. We were in jeans and the people at the next table were more dressed up. It gives off a warm vibe of people coming together to enjoy an amazing meal."}
{"text":"Me and a friend from out of town decided to try this restaurant after hearing my roommate rave about it. It definitely lived up to the hype. From the moment we entered Vue 412 the service was incredible including the manager who made us feel very welcome. I ordered the lobster Mac and cheese and haven't stopped thinking about it since. This will definitely be the spot I take everyone from now on so I can impress them with an amazing view and even more amazing food."}
{"text":"We reserved this for my daughter's graduation. We chose because of the view but were very impressed with the service and the food! We were a party of 8 and had prime rib, filet, salmon, crabcakes and lobster mac and cheese(with a full lobster on top!) Our waiter was very attentive and answered all of our many questions about the menu choices, wine and beer recommendations. Everyone loved their food and the overall experience.  When another waiter saw me taking a picture, he offered to take it and got the whole amazing skyline.  I would recommend this for any special event or dinner out.  The prices were reasonable for a fine dining establishment.  We would definitely go again."}
{"text":"The service made our visit! The manager Joe and waiter Nathan made us feel so welcomed! The about section says not good for kids and this is completely untrue! They had a great kids menu and Nathan was so wonderful with our son! The view was spectacular! I had the lobster Mac and cheese which was very good!"}
{"text":"Great view, ok food. We went here on a date night after doing the incline and walking around. The restaurant does have a wonderful view of the point and Pittsburgh. We were definitely over dressed with many patrons in jeans and tshirts. They had a lunch menu and dinner menu (lunch being just smaller portions of the dinner menu). I enjoyed their lobster special, which tasted fresh. My date got the veal parmesan, which was ok- not great. All in all, it was an okay place for a date, though a little pricey for the atmosphere and food quality. One of those places you go to once but probably not a return spot for us."}
{"text":"I give it two stars for the view but I can pay $2.50, take the incline, and have an even better view. When reviewing a nice restaurant, I evaluate on 3 things - ambiance, service, and of course food/drink. The ambiance was not what I was expecting, the restaurant didn't seem to have air conditioning and on a 90 degree day, it was getting really toasty in there. Additionally, it was really dated and for being under the impression that the restaurant had recently opened, it was lacking heavily in this area. As for the service, it felt almost nonexistent beyond the lovely hostess who was nice. The waitress didn't introduce herself, didn't go over the menu, etc. All things I would expect when paying $20+ for a small piece of salmon. Weirdly enough, our waitress was LOVELY to the table right next to us (an older couple), so it really felt like it came down to her assuming who would tip better - her loss. And finally, the most important thing - food & drinks. I can withstand bad service if you are going to provide me with an exceptional culinary experience. We ordered the hummus as a starter, which flavor wise was fine, but the way that it had been prepared made it pretty dry when it got to the table. I ordered the salmon and my friend ordered the bolognese. I ate some of both and both were lackluster. The salmon was fishy and overcooked, you can only say \"blackened\" when applying seasoning, not when you are pan searing it to the point of dehydrating the fish. The bolognese was too sweet and too watery. Bolognese is a robust, meaty and heavy sauce, if it looks more like soup - that's an issue and means it's not being prepared properly. Additionally, we got the chocolate cake to share and it tasted like an overly iced store bought cake. So overall, for the hype and excitement about this establishment, I would recommend finding a different restaurant if you actually are looking for a good food experience."}
{"text":"I went to Vue 412 with my girlfriend last night and overall it was a great experience. From the time I made the reservation to our whole dining experience, the staff was very courteous and knowledgable. After sitting down and looking at the menu, we noticed it was quite different from the online menu we viewed previously due to there being a new chef. Needless to say the view was priceless and a perfect setting for a date night. We started with the duck tacos (recommended from our waiter, Adam) and risotto balls which were both very good and had great flavor. Only a minor complaint that our entrée (spaghetti bolognese) came out as we were still finishing up our appetizer. Our bolognese was delicious and definitely hit the spot. We then got tiramisu and creme brûlée for dessert which was the perfect end to our meal. My only complaint as far as the dining experience was the choice of music that played throughout the restaurant. It sounded like it was the pop hits of the late 90s/early 2000s and meant more for a college Pregame rather than a nice dinner at a well todo restaurant.  While the music was off putting, the food and staff were great and when I'm back in town, I'd definitely dine here again!"}
{"text":"Vue 412 is a welcome addition to Mt. Washington. It has of course a wonderful view of the city. The menu is very creative and wide ranging. Lunch selections went from mussels to  good looking burgers. And the waitstaff was \"Pittsburgh\" friendly. The price point was very reasonable for the quality of the food. Will return soon to have dinner. It is worth the trip up the mount!"}
{"text":"We had the hamburger, hummus which they forgot to bring out. Tacos and sauce was really bad and cold, quesadillas and something else all cold but the Riesling wine was very good and the negroni was very good."}
{"text":"I had such an amazing night at Vue 412! We had a large party and staff were quick to accommodate all of us when we arrived. I was taken aback by the view of course. Just gorgeous, it was hard to take my eyes off the giant windows which display the city perfectly. Our waitress was great - very sweet girl who handled our large party well.   We shared the hummus plate which was delicious. My friends and I shared a bottle of wine which was reasonably priced. Osso bucco entree was delicious - packed with savory flavor. The meat literally fell off the bone. I didn't even touch my knife to it once. Asparagus was fresh and cooked to perfection. The risotto which accompanied my meal was excellent as well - cheesy and creamy. I couldn't wait to eat my leftovers and I can't wait to come back to this new restaurant."}
{"text":"A wonderful choice for a celebration dinner. My husband and I went last night to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  Great selection of cocktails, amazing food and terrific service. Topped off by a fabulous view of the city from our table. We were treated to a free drink for our anniversary from Vue 412, then met a special couple at the bar who sent us drink to celebrate - it was so sweet. Brandi is a top notch server who took great care of us the whole time. Definitely recommend this place for a special night."}
{"text":"After reading other reviews, we decided to go there since the only real complaint was the time to get served. It was a great choice! The view is unbeatable and the food is tasty! The owner/manager, Joe, was very friendly and checked with us twice. Our server, Nate was fantastic! We had the Berry Salad, Calamari, Spicy Shrimp appetizer, Strip Steak, Lobster Mac-n-Cheese, Scallops, Chicken Artichoke Piccata, and Squash Ravioli. Everything was delicious! We ended with Cappuccino, Créme Brûlée, and Tiramisu.  It did take a while for our main courses to arrive, but it was worth the wait and it was beautiful to enjoy the magnificent view!  We were very pleased and we sent a couple people there on our way back to the incline."}
{"text":"Everything was spot on.  Making, then changing the reservations, to our greeting, pleasant and easy. Service was excellent, food was outstanding. We talked about our meals for the rest of the night. Cannot wait to go back. Similar menu to their Roman Bistro. Salmon perfect, pasta amazing. Beans and greens will bring us back soon. Casual dress, great prices, great view."}
{"text":"We were visiting Pittsburgh and everyone said we had to go to Mt Washington. So we did and of course had to stop for drinks. Vue 412 was where we stopped. The view of course was magnificent. Dana's drinks were perfect. I had a dirty martini which they had their own recipe including blue cheese stuffed olives. It definitely was the best I ever had. My wife had the blood orange Bellini which she said was delicious. Joe the owner , came over and gave us a history of the area . He is a very personable and we enjoyed talking with him. He made us feel very welcome. It felt like he was an old friend or even family member. We didn't eat but my wife did order the chocolate cake which was rich and decadent.  We will be back to Pittsburgh regularly since my son bought a house there and we are looking forward to having dinner at Vue 412."}
{"text":"What a hot day when we rode the incline. So we were on the prowl for drinks and some food. We found this place because they had an employee sitting outside so you could easily tell that they were open for business. The posted menu showed a veggie burger. Fingers crossed that it wasn't made with eggs, we went in and sat in the bar area which had a fantastic view! The bartender was very friendly and chatty. He took our drink order. Confirmed that the veggie burger was indeed vegan (yay!) and so we each ordered one. Sadly we were later told that they didn't have any made. Ok, no worries, we'll just drink our drinks.  Then to our great surprise out comes one veggie burger! Apparently they had enough ingredients to cobble together to make one. Perfect! We shared it and it was just enough for our tummies. We were only visiting Pittsburgh, but we'd definitely go back.  Thanks for a great snack!"}
{"text":"First things first, the vue is amazing! You can see the entire city of Pittsburgh from your table! The top upstairs area is the best spot for a great view. Our waiter, Lorenzo was spot on with his service and gave the best food recommendations! I ordered bang bang shrimp, calamari, and lobster mac n cheese which were all shareable sizes for two people. The shrimp and lobster mac were impeccable however the calamari was just ok. Overall, this is a gem in disguise in mount Washington. I will definitely be back to try more food and to enjoy the vue!!"}
{"text":"It was our first time there yesterday and we loved it!! It was Valentine's Day and everything was amazing!!! The service was great as well! 8:30 reservation with a window seat and they definitely captured the mood of romance I was going for! It made our night!  I'm so glad I chose this place over Altius because we had our own table for two and we were able to have privacy from other customers. I didn't want to leave cuz I was so enchanted with the setting and the food! The Valentine's menu was wonderful as well !! I'd definitely go back! We came from out of town and I had planned that reservation blindly and I definitely made the right choice! Thank you VUE 412! We had the best Valentine's Day! I wish I remembered our servers name, he's a bartender there too and he was fabulous!!! Just FABULOUS! I'm a server too so I'm very judgmental with other ones lol lol! But he made our night there even better! He even made us a list of other Pittsburgh activities going on. We loved him! And we loved Vue 412!!"}
{"text":"A delicious meal, great service, and that gorgeous view made for a fantastic evening.  Our server was very personable, knowledgeable about the menu, and helped us choose a nice bottle of vino!  We started with the mussels, which were delicious and huge! I had a spicy chicken pasta dish as my entree, and really enjoyed it. It had a very nice kick to it and was full of flavor. I ended with the cranberry creme brûlée. Hands down one of the best creme brûlées I've had in the city.  I am excited to return soon!"}
{"text":"First review so I'm going to keep it simple: great service, great food, amazing view."}
{"text":"Oh my word. A *prime* example of a place being overrated just because of the view.  There was a worker wearing sweatpants who I think may have been a chef and ermmm doesn't really match the ambience of the place.  (Valentine's Day menu) LOBSTER BISQUE: Salty and way too chunky. (Waiter did say \"oh the crab bisque?\" At first so I don't know if it was even lobster) PRIME RIB: Huge cut of meat and a baked potato. Portion size was crazy so I guess it was worth the money. Bland and a little fatty so it was too chewy rather than tender.  I did happen to get a glass of Merlot and that was the best part of the meal, lol.  Couldn't bear getting a dessert because I didn't want to stay any longer. They treated us well with service so that'll be the only reason I won't give it a 1 but the food..  that's enough to not bring me back.  If you're making your way up to the incline, don't waste your time here and spend the extra bucks at Lemont or maybe Altius."}
{"text":"food was great, service was extremely slow for not being crowded. glad we came, view was beautiful but would've expected snappier service (dirty plate & cup removal) for a place viewed as upscale."}
{"text":"I'm going to write a thorough review of this one... Because if you are like me and considering the comments and ratings for Vue 412, and weighing the 4 star overall rating against some of the negative reviews, and on the fence about trying it out, this is for you. Plus, the manager replies to reviews on here and seems genuinely interested in improving his restaurant, so perhaps this will help him too. My husband wanted me to cancel our reservation after reading the reviews, but I convinced him to give it a try. I knew I was going to be in BIG trouble if this didn't go well;)  I booked through Open Table and requested a window table, explaining this was my first time on Mt. Washington and the whole reason we chose this restaurant. I called to inquire about parking on our way there. The hostess that answered the phone needs to work on her presentation. She was not rude, but she definitely does not have the kind of demeanor you want making the first impression for the restaurant. She informed me there was a parking lot across the street, but did not mention it cost $10. No other parking options were given. No thanks for choosing us, no see you soon, no thanks for calling, no is there anything else I can help you with (which is phone service 101). Given the fact that View 412 takes some pretty hard hits for service in the reviews, she needs to step it up big time. She must not have checked us in via open table because we did not get our points:(  We arrived, \"greeted\" by the same hostess from the phone. No smiles, no welcome to Vue 412. I'm pretty sure she just looked at us until we spoke first. We were seated right away, not at a window table as requested and given 2 menus for a party of 4.  Then, our server Jennifer greeted us. Super nice, knowledgeable about the menu and specials, helpful, attentive, on time. She provided great service throughout and we were there for about 3 hours (by choice).   I had the halibut special (served over Parmesan risotto). My husband and the other gentleman with us both had scallops, and his wife had shrimp scampi. We also had the shrimp appetizer. Dessert was creme brûlée and lemon mascarpone cake. Every single item was cooked perfectly and absolutely delicious. I'm extremely picky about seafood, much more so than anyone I know.... And it was all very impressive, fresh, presented well, seasoned or seared perfectly, etc.  I think the 4 out of 5 stars is an accurate rating because there are obviously a few minor kinks that need to be worked out here. Once that happens, this is easily going to be a 5 star restaurant. These kinks I am referring to are: -the hostess needs to go or be held to a higher standard of service. She is the first impression and not delivering. Everyone else there seems to be working so hard to do a great job, she is not doing her part and is letting the team down. -We were informed by Jennifer that there currently is no drink menu because it is being revamped. I'm a person that needs a drink menu if I'm not ordering beer or wine. I told her to just have the bartender make me something sweet, but not overly sweet and with ginger...any kind of liquor is ok. I was brought what seemed to be an adult version of a Shirley Temple. It was not good at all. I should have sent it back, but I did not, nor did I complain about it. But, I did switch to a Reisling that was fantastic. -The other issue we noticed, is that whoever is doing the ordering hasn't quite figured out how to meet the demand yet. They were out of a lot of items (greens and beans appetizer, grey goose, one of the red wines, etc). In fact, they even ran out of dinner menus and our party of 4 had to share 2, which was no big deal to us. However, there were a few open tables and it could have been an issue if the 6 top beside us got seated and there were zero menus to present them with. -The atmosphere could easily be amped up a bit. With a location and set up like that, I would definitely go for a more trendy vibe, but it kind of felt retro to me.  A summary of the MANY positives...the view is AMAZING from any table. The food was OUTSTANDING. The service (excluding the hostess) was IMPECCABLE.   On the service, since that is the category most criticized (referring to everyone except the hostess)....Not only was our server, Jennifer, fantastic, but we must have had 2 or 3 other employees refill water and deliver food. All were very pleasant. One man, possibly the manager, was at our table twice and inquired about our satisfaction both times. When we were on the sidewalk exiting, one of the kitchen employees happened to be out there and saw our friend drop her after dinner mint, he ran back inside and brought her a handful.   Sorry for the really long review, I rely heavily on reviews so always do my part. I don't want anyone missing out on this great place because of a couple of negative reviews"}
{"text":"We had the best meal! We are from out of town and we were enjoying the Duquesne incline. Came up the funicular and found this little gem was open. We popped in for a pumpkin ale - the ale was spectacular! I ordered a light salad and my husband ordered shrimp scampi. The shrimps were large and bathed in butter. Excellente!"}
{"text":"The view of the city was beautiful. I had the crab cakes. They were delicious! My date had the steak and lobster. He said it was delicious!  Oh yea! The meat and cheese tray was great too! Creme brulee is great if you have room for dessert. We shared. Laurence our waiter from New York was great."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere, view and service. We just stopped by for coffee and dessert and were treated very kindly by the manager. He told us about the history of The Three Rivers and other historical landmarks - they were easy to point out through the huge window with an amazing view of Pittsburgh. He was very kind to us and the kids, showing everybody not just respect but genuine care."}
{"text":"4.5/5   Came here for lunch after a long drive during the memorial weekend. Got a drink and a berry salad. They were both okay, but with the view like that it's hard to not enjoy the atmosphere. The restaurant definitely feels a bit dated but maintained well.   Now for the highlight!!!   I got the Lobster Mac & Cheese as the entree and it is freaking delicious  !  The lobster tail has a nice white wine flavor, and that ball of lobster butter really take this dish to the super amazing level , perhaps the best lobster Mac and cheese I've ever had.    The lunch portion goes for under $20 bucks (18 if I remembered correctly), which is a bargain for any lobster dishes. Oh and the place has a great city view over the Pittsburgh skyline no matter where you sit. The veal Marsala dish is quite big but it's dinner portion. Pretty good as well! - Pittsburgh is an amazing city. Hopefully I could visit again soon! And if you are around the tram area, this might be the best place to dine in. I'll definitely come back to get this lobster Mac and cheese again!"}
{"text":"The service here is definitely worth the five stars alone! Add the absolutely stunning view and good food and twist more could you ask for! It is truly a great place! Definitely recommend this to anyone!"}
{"text":"Waiter was attentive, but brought half our table food, brought the food for another table near us, then five minutes later brought the rest.  (Never do that).  Told us they could not serve any bread because they ran out.  Prosciutto and romaine salad was good.  Ordered my burger medium-rare and it came out well done. Ceviche entree was more appropriate as an appetizer.  Overall, the food took forever and was underwhelming to say the least."}
{"text":"Great food and great views of the city! Took the incline to get to the restaurant and enjoyed the history behind the incline. Their crème brûlée was fabulous. Enjoyed this spot on our last night in the Burgh. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"View is awesome and service is extraordinary.   A member of my party needed something rather urgently from a pharmacy and the restaurant manager Joe drove me to the store in his car.   Such amazing Pittsburgh service.   Our waiter Patrick is equally awesome.   Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Excellent food!!  Thank you Chef Cam.  Compliments to the new front of the house manager for his professionalism and hospitality.  Our server was also fabulous!  We loved our dining experience!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very accommodating, the host let us have a table with a better view when requested, the bartender made our group cocktails not on the menu, and the waitress gave a sparkler in cotton candy for a birthday celebration. Menu is not current on open table. Would recommend dressinh up if you're going."}
{"text":"The staff is so friendly and pleasant it's a pleasure.  Oh the food is delicious. But the View is amazing."}
{"text":"I visited Vue 412 during Pittsburgh's restaurant week.  The food was good but the service left a lot to be desired.  During our meal spanning over 2 hours, water was never refilled.  Entrees were brought out before we were even half way done with appetizers.  We ordered a bottle of wine and then a second different bottle but were not given new glasses.  Just really no attention to detail.  For the price point service was less than expected.  There are many restaurants in the area with food of equal quality and better service."}
{"text":"We walked to the restaurant after taking the Incline to the top of the mountain. It happened to be the first place open and we walked in around lunch time. Seven of us say at the bar and enjoyed the view. The place is really dated but the food and service was great! We ordered a bunch of appetizers.  Recommend!"}
{"text":"You can't beat the view but that's about the only thing you can't beat here.  We had reservations for an early dinner (5:30) since we were seeing a show that evening.  We were seated right beside a service area where they have their scheduling computer.  It was clear that there was much confusion with who was taking care of which tables in their 3-story facility.  It was very distracting and annoying as the manager, dressed in dirty cargo pants, and the servers were trying to figure out what they were doing, grouped literally 2-feet from our table, and as the manager and our server repeatedly coughed...apparently they were both ill.    Here is a list of other transgressions.  The manager had to summons our server to take our order after almost an 1/2 hour even though there were very few people in the restaurant...our server appeared to be, uhmmmm, not of clear mind as we could barely understand what he was saying as well as some strange behavior...my filet special was WAY over cooked but that was because they gave me someone else's steak, which the manager admitted and was going to take care of but never did.  The server did however take our wine off the bill for the \"long wait.\"...the server brought my wife's left-overs and informed us that he had dropped it on the floor but only lost three of the gnocchi before repackaging it and somehow expecting that this way o.k.!     I will say, the food, my overdone steak notwithstanding, was very good and the wine selection was not bad, which is the only reason I gave a 2-star rating instead of 1-star.  But for a restaurant with an asset like the view from Mt. Washington to be that unprofessional was astounding.  It really is a shame.  Will not return."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. The view is your typical Mount Washington overlook of the city, but a plus is that they had mirrors all around so you could take it in no matter your seat. The portions were large and actually tasty -- unlike other Mount Washington restaurants that simply think they can get by because of their view. I did find it odd that they had craft paper atop of the linens and I tried to get our server to loosen up a bit but he was being a little stuffy (I don't put much stake in this - he was great overall just not much personality - hey it could have been an off night for him..). Overall, I do recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My partner and i always come here and our experience is usually some what delightful. This visit was nothing the same. Our server was okay! Long story short my partner and I are heading to good ole max & ermas $40 later"}
{"text":"This is my second five-star review for Vue 412.  We dined here on December 10th for our family Christmas dinner with our children.  I can't even begin to tell you how pleased we all were with the food, and especially the service.  Our waiter, Nathan was outstanding.  He was very friendly, and the service he provided was above and beyond.  He was always checking in to make sure we had enough to drink, to make sure our appetizers were fine, and that we were all happy with our dinner selections.  The food was incredible.  My sons both had the Osso Bucco, and they raved about it, and the portion was quite substantial.  There was also the Tortellacci, Scallops, Veal Parmigiana, and I dined on a special of steak topped with crab.  Everyone raved about their dishes, and the portions were all plenty.  Thank you again to our server Nathan for the excellent service, and for making our family Christmas dinner even more special.  We will definitely ask to be seated at your table the next time we dine."}
{"text":"When I called to see if the they had valet parking I was told if I wanted valet parking to go to the Lemont.  We were uncomfortably cold as every time the door was opened we were hit with a blast of cold air.  Our waitress was very nice but kept getting our order mixed up.  Our dinners were barely warm.  My husband did not care for his filet.  He said it tasted more like flank steak.  My lobster (which was not very tender) was in a sauce along with potatoes which were in some kind of gravy.  The presentation was terrible.  Will not be going again!"}
{"text":"My recent visit here was a delite. We've heard good and bad things about this place but the service was great and our food was very hot and delicious. I had the special that night which was Cod with red skinned potatoes and broccolini while my boyfriend had the Osso Buco. Both dishes were absolutely delicious. The view of the city might be the best part of the whole experience. I definitely recommend Vue 412 to anyone who doesn't mind spending a little extra money on a nice evening on Mt Washington"}
{"text":"We made a last minute reservation for a party of 14! The serving team was very attentive. The food was delicious! Some of our favorites included the scallops, veal Marsala and surf & turf! The view is incredible and a short walk from the Duquesne Incline. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"I stopped at this restaurant as I was in Pittsburgh for work. The place is less than a block outside of the top of the Desquesne Trolley which traveled up Mt. Washington. There were several other restaurants on the same block, but this spot seemed particularly modern and hip for the old and antiquated area. The view is breathtaking and definitely a great location for a romantic dinner. It was also very small and calm as well which also adds to the romantic dinner spot. We sat at the bar which was ran by a very friendly and sweet bartender (I didn't catch her name) but she definitely made us feel welcome and comfortable even though we were just passing through for a drink. They have a nice selection of wines and beers as well."}
{"text":"The view was about the only good thing about this place. The food was wayyy overpriced. I feel like they heated up a frozen prime rib for me. The service was okay, but for being the only ones in the restaurant, it sure did feel rushed. Would never recommend this place."}
{"text":"Outstanding every thing on menu we ate was superb. That never happens. They have a new chef and they better keep her. Overall an outstanding experience."}
{"text":"Lousy food, lousy service, incompetent chef, dingy atmosphere. Pittsburgh has many great restaurants. Don't waste your time at this one which won't last."}
{"text":"We came here tonight for restaurant week. The ambiance, the food, the service, and the affordability combined gives it a five star. We did the 3 course restaurant week special for 35.18. Our server Liz and the manager Joe were welcoming and very helpful.  The mussel appetizer was to die for. Served in a spicy sauce with sausage and lots of peppers-ask for a spoon because you're not going to want to waste this.  My boyfriend and I split the seafood trio pasta and the hangar steak. I especially enjoyed the garlic cream sauce and papardelle noodles with the pasta. We enjoyed the strawberry creme brûlée (which was just right-not too sweet) and the caramel cheesecake. My boyfriend had to keep swatting my fork away from his plate because it was so good.   Beautiful view. Great music selection. Excellent food."}
{"text":"Visited vue 412 for dinner and had a wonderful experience.  The food was delicious, the atmosphere was relaxing and the view was spectacular.  The prices are very reasonable for the area and location compared to others on mt Washington.  I really enjoyed the manager greeting the table and getting to know you like it was a mom and pop establishment where they value the patrons who visited.  If looking for parking there is a parking garage or if can find street parking which maybe a walk for you.  I suggest taxi, Uber, or Lyft.  If near the Duquesne incline, it's only a few store front down from it.  The management staff is very accommodating as we are planning an event in the future and they provided different options as which of the three floors we wanted, if wanted to use their third floor which is for private parties and they can do a buffet or do full or partial menu.  Definitely a place we are going to visit again."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews and the close vicinity to the Duquesne Incline station, I thought this would be a good place to try and boy did I make the right choice! First off, the service was excellent. It wasn't crowded yet so we got window seating with perfect view of the city. Liz our server was super friendly and helpful about the sights and museums in the area. The manager came by several times to check us and made conversation. I was very impressed and can't even recall the last time we received such attentive service. Bonus points for sure! For appetizers we ordered the meatballs w/ricotta and the mussels PEI. Both delicious...I forgot to take the pics until we already started digging in! I ordered the osso buco which is always a must when i see it on the menu. Not many Italian restaurants serve this dish so I feel if it's on the menu, then its worth ordering! I  must say that this was the best osso buco I've had...maybe ever! It never tastes exactly the same but this one was super tender yet there was a slight outer crisp that was seasoned to perfection! My hubby got the special which was the braised short ribs. It was also delicious. The mashed potato sides. Brussel sprouts, squash medley was all tasty and cooked nicely! We were so full but wanted to try their dessert so we ordered it to go...death by chocolate and the limoncello cake! We plan on visiting Pittsburgh again this summer with our other boys and this place is definitely on our list!"}
{"text":"We were there for a birthday and the food was excellent and the staff very accommodating. We had a baby with us and the staff were great with her. We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"We were excited to try Vue412. Getting to look out over Pittsburgh and enjoy a new restaurant. We went on a Thursday and it was a quiet night there. We got a great table overlooking Heinz Field and the rivers. It was lovely. The wine selection was very nice with nothing too crazy expensive. The menu, too, was terrific. I was the one who couldn't decide, but everyone else found something right away. We got...lobster mac-n-cheese, chicken Romano, chicken parmesan, and salmon with tortellini. Everything dish was prepared so well. They were all terrific. Our favorite; the lobster mac-n-cheese. The person in our party that doesn't usually finish meals polished this off!! We got one dessert to share; death by chocolate. Yum! The owner/manager came over to the table twice (Joe). He was very nice. He told us a little trivia about the rivers we didn't know. He told us everything is made there, farmed locally, and to order. Jason, our server, brought us our calamari appetizer very quickly and our meals nicely spaced afterward. We were in a bit of a time crunch, but we didn't feel rushed. It was just right.  Pricing ran about $30 per person with 2 wines, 1 appetizer, 1 dessert and 4 entrees.   I would say, however, the ambience needs to be updated. It seems like this used to be a different restaurant and re-opened as Vue412. Oh, and the bathrooms are on the third floor!?!  But, really, try it. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"View is great. Dana the waitress is great. The food is AMAZING!! Will recommend to whom ever I speak to, thanks Vue 412!"}
{"text":"The view! Or, rather, The Vue! An incredible sight. We had seats toward the middle of the restaurant, so it was slightly blocked by others. I had the squash ravioli and it was yummy. It had sweet (squash) and savory (white wine dressing) and just enough Parmesan on top. My beau had chicken parm, and loved it. The dessert was \"death by chocolate,\" i.e. a very dry chocolate cake. The menu was a little limiting as I am a vegetarian, and my beau is allergic to seafood. The menus were also kind of, well, ugly. The prices promised something a lot fancier than it was. But the squash ravioli was good and the view incredible."}
{"text":"Joe made us feel like we were relatives visiting from Italy. We have dined in close to 14 restaurants the last two trips. Joe was impeccable in hospitality and personality.  I think the Parpadelle is not to be missed. It's a must. The shrimp was grilled perfectly for my salad. Only New Zealand's Sauvignon Blanc for our table and we were indeed pleasantly surprised that they had it. Perfect lunch. More than drop dead panoramic view of how the the Allegheny and Monaghahelia (forgive me) Rivers merge into the Ohio.... priceless view. Precious Owner. Amazing Chef! We were so pleased. Glad to be visiting this lovely town. Thank you Joe (and Nathan)."}
{"text":"I booked this restaurant in January for my sons rehersal dinner. We made our plans for food tasting with JJ. Our appointment was for late May as the dinner for 20 is in July. Very sadly, my husband passed away in early May. As we went to our scheduled food tasting, we called as we were going to be a few minutes late. We were informed, quite rudely, that our reservation for 20 was lost and that they had no tasting scheduled. We were upset , but since we were almost there, we went anyway. We met with Dan, who pretended to be a manager and we spent 2 hours with him selecting food with his promises we are all set nothing to worry about. I never heard from him again and when I called the restaurant, they say they lost our reservation again. And Dan was not a manager, but a server, and was fired. I then speak to Melissa who told me she has been there for years and she promises it will be a beautiful event. I take an hour and go over everything again. I never hear from her again. I call the restaurant and find out that she resigned two weeks later. Then in 1 summer, 4 managers later, I get the owner Rose. Who also says they lost our reservation.  This was extremely stressful to say the least and I tell her the whole story, including losing my beloved husband  right before our sons wedding.  She is stone cold and says \" I have problems too\" WOW. DO NOT DO NOT plan an event here.  These people are cold, heartless,  disorganized and DO NOT care about their customers. We are going to another restaurant and the new place was kind enough to help us a few weeks before the event. PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM VUE 412."}
{"text":"Came across this place while travelling through Pittsburgh. The lobster mac and cheese is absolutely incredible! Definitely recommend( there was so much lobster and it was cooked perfectly.  My server also recommended a wonderful wine that went great with the meal.  The manager was very nice and stopped by personally to make sure everything was going well. He also offered to let me go upstairs and open the sliding glass doors to get better photos of the view. Overall, a great experience!"}
{"text":"My wife and I both ordered different fish specials, and absolutely EVERY bite was FULL of flavor. We will definitely return to Vue 412 on our next trip to Pittsburgh.   The staff was very polite and accomodating, and the view was incredible. There isnt a bad seat in the restaurant, so that every seat has a great view of downtown from the cliffs of Mt Washington.   You NEED to check this place out."}
{"text":"The food is high quality and the service was phenomenal. The kids menu was wrong and we picked chicken fingers but they didn't have any so the manager went a few doors down to order some chicken fingers for a very picky little girl and made our dinner even more spectacular!  Will eat here again! The view is beautiful and such a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place to eat and enjoy the view of Pittsburgh. I had a beet salad with a salmon sandwich that was amazing. The service was incredible and attentive and Matt was fantastical. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant at any time of the year but we always go at Christmas time. I usually get the osso bucco which is so good that I have trouble choosing other things. Tonight I went with the special which was tempura shrimp served over risotto. I was delighted. My wife had another special, Salmon with crab and shrimp stuffing that was also over risotto. The prices are quite reasonable for the quality of the food and the service is great."}
{"text":"Great location!!!  Overall the food is very good and very affordable for Mt Washington.   Wine list is also very affordable.   They do the best they can with the size of the restaurant.  The charcuterie was average and not well presented.  The server was not prepared to tell us what was on the plate.  Entrees were good but not well timed.  Servers seemed to be very irritated with each other.  We will definitely be going back but hope the simple things are improved."}
{"text":"Honestly it's worth going here for the view alone. It's right next to le mont and the view is stunning. However, the food was delicious, the service exceptional an the chef was super nice. We had the entire restaurant to ourselves on a wed night and I felt spoiled. It's also very reasonably priced for a mt Washington restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is amazing and the view is spectacular!  The staff were really nice to my elderly father. Will definitely come back when I'm back in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Best \"Vue\" in the city!  The food was outstanding! Very friendly staff and took care of everything. Thank you so much for the great meal!"}
{"text":"Very accommodating staff and beautiful restaurant. I dined her for a work Christmas party (9 guests). We made a reservation about a week in advance and they had set up a beautiful table with an amazing view of the city. The manager introduced himself to each one of us as we arrived and took our jackets. I had the gnocchi, which was a mix of chicken parm, mushrooms and gnocchi and I LOVED IT. Great cocktails also! I plan to go back to celebrate my birthday this year."}
{"text":"This place sucked, bad food, bad service, good view!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! They want me to make this longer so blah blah blah go stillers   Ok so I did write this the day I came in so here was are experience since you wanted to know. I made reservations at 8 and when I got there the hostess told me they didn't have a table for us and they could only seat us in the lounge, which you might as well call the basement filled with lawn furniture, besides the window view it was run down and depressing down there with plastic furniture. We ordered crab dip, it was served with tortilla chips, reminded me of something I would get at eat n park. Then we got the clam chowder, almost positive it came out of a can. We also ordered a $10 Caesar salad and that took forever to come out, the waitress informed us that the salad maker quit which I though was weird for her to share with us. Oh before I forget, get a real sign outside not that plastic banner, take a walk up the street and check out altius, you're charging the same prices as them, learn what a real high end restaurant looks like. Back to the salad, when we got it it was a plate of romaine drenched in Caesar dressing, no anchovies, no croutons and no cheese. So for our entrees, I got a bacon cheeseburger with green beans. It came out without bacon on it other than that it was fine, probably a step below a red robin burger but still ok, definitely not worth $15. The green beans were fresh but came out untrimmed, every green bean had 1\" hard, woody stems coming of each end. My girlfriend got your $39 ribeye and asked for it medium rare. Your ribeye is described as having a garlic and roasted shallot butter. Here's what she got, the cheapest, thinnest piece of meat I've ever seen with so much chili seasoning on it that it was impossible to eat. Where do you shop for your meat at the 3 day super sale at shop n save, it was a joke. We immediately informed the waitress that we were not happy with the steak and told her to remove it. I found it odd that a manager wouldn't even come down to see what the problem was. Now let's get to the service, the waitress never checked in with us, never refilled the water, forgot the same beer order twice, had no clue what was on the menu and made us feel like we were at the neighborhood dennys not what's supposed to be a upscale restaurant on mt Washington. Also where do you get off charging $15 for a gin martini and teach your wait staff the difference between straight up and on the rocks, they should know those things. In conclusion you are terribly overpriced, your food is lousy and you have a terrible wait staff, but hey at least you got that view!!!"}
{"text":"If you want to go here for restaurant week you'd better go early because they run out of EVERYTHING. I pretty much picked this place for the sea bass and they were out of it. The View was the best thing about it and our sweet waitress, who was very apologetic about the slow service.   We were seated upstairs and outside on maybe the most humid evening of the year which was a bit of a let down.   The food was decent. I got the salmon for dinner which was good, although slightly overlooked. For dessert I got the lemon marscapone cake which was good but nothing special. Basically only three dessert on the menu were available because they were either out of it or it was frozen (you read that right, FROZEN).  For the location this place seems like the overall experience should be up to par with its neighbors, Altius and LeMont but it definitely falls short.    All the waitstaff was very sweet. The whole operation just seems poorly managed."}
{"text":"We had just gotten off the Incline trolley and were looking in at all the Windows when we were invited inside and escorted to the bar... Very nice.  The view really is great and we promptly received our drinks.  After that, it went downhill.  The bartender was seated a table of 3 and it seemed she couldn't handle more than one thing at a time.  My husband asked for an ice water that never came until he asked someone else.  There were dirty glasses everywhere and everything seemed like a cluster... Nobody knew what they were doing.  The mirror behind the bar should be removed because in its reflection you can see all of the crap and dirty rags and random stuff piled underneath the bar.  To top it off the waitstaff seemed to be standing around complaining about this, that, and the other thing.  2 stars for the view and the drinks, but the professionalism and cleanliness could be improved."}
{"text":"Ate at Vue 412 on a recent weekday evening and enjoyed it immensely.  The view is spectacular --as good as any on Mt. Washington and the people are very friendly and accommodating. (One example: We were a bit fussy about what table we preferred and they very nicely cleaned off a recently used one that we liked a bit better than the one we were led to.)  The menu is reasonable, the food is good and the prices are reasonable too.  The waiter could use a bit more experience with the drink menu and stock but he more than made up for that with his attentiveness and terrific service.  It really seemed like they (waiter and manager and others) were all trying hard to make it an enjoyable experience and they succeeded!   Will go back soon!"}
{"text":"Great food, service, and view. One of the best filets I have ever had. Very attentive manager checked on us several times!!"}
{"text":"We had a reservation for 10 people at 8:30pm on New Year's Eve and were very excited to visit this new restaurant. This is a long review but worth the read. I am a server and have worked in the industry for years, so it takes a lot for me to write a negative review.  We arrived and were seated in a timely manner. At around 8:45 we ordered drinks and our 4 courses from the waitress. She came back a few minutes later and let us know that they were out of 1 of 3 appetizers (the only non-seafood option) and 1 of 3 salads. This was a bit strange since it was a small menu for the night and it was only 8:30! So that was the first red flag. Our waitress was nice but seemed like she wasn't trained properly to handle this kind of situation. No one offered us a different food option and we were basically told you can order from what's there or skip the appetizer and you'll still get charged full price.   Next, we ordered a second round of drinks after about 20 minutes and it was a disaster. One of the girls in the party realized she was given the wrong bottle of wine the first time around and notified the waitress about it to bring the right one (she hadn't even drank one full glass of it). Never got it. Half the table ordered from one server and the other half from our server. Some people got drinks, some didn't. I was given the wrong drink and then not brought the correct one for 45 minutes! On a night like New Year's Eve after you've just told us that you're out of a few things on the menu, we should've been able to at least get our drinks quickly. One guy in our party ended up going down to the bar to order them because it took so long. The first course appetizers came out at a normal time but once we finished, the dishes sat on our table the entire time we were there. The salads did not come out until almost 10pm (an hour and a half after we sat down) and we quickly realized they used the same salad for the other two options. One was a bibb lettuce salad and one was a spring salad. Both had mixed greens. I understand if you run out of something to use something else, but the whole point of having three different salads on the menu is that they were supposed to be different. So that was frustrating.  We had somewhere else to be and were getting very irritated and hungry. We asked around 1015 where our food was and the waitress came back and said about 20 more minutes. We then made the decision to ask to speak to a manager and let her know our concerns. The lady seemed nice but very flustered at what was going on and didn't really have an answer as to why the service and kitchen were lacking. After talking to her and realizing we weren't getting anywhere, we decided to pay for what we had and just leave. They only made us pay for the alcohol which was nice, and we left our waitress a 20% tip on the $130 in alcohol. Had we stayed, she probably would've had a $1500 bill and gotten over 20%.   As a waitress, I probably would have stayed if there had been a little more customer service. We were never offered a round of drinks, or a discount for the appetizers we did not want when they were out of the one, and if they would've made a bit more effort, things may have been different. I know it's a new restaurant, but they were not prepared for the night at all. I would not go back on a busy night ever again."}
{"text":"The Good: The food was great.  We had a Bacon Cheeseburger and a Prime Rib Sandwich, both with french fries. Bread was good, the meats were cooked to our liking, and everything was seasoned nicley.   The Bad: The upstairs seating was on a different level than the kitchen, therefore you could not smell food when entering the restaurant.  What you could smell, did not smell appetizing. It was hard to put my finger on, but it was an instant turn-off.   The Ugly: The wait time for our food was boarder line agregous. We visited for lunch and waited over 45 mins. (after placing our order) The wait staff and management tried to smooth it over, but when you sit for an hour with nothing to eat, there is not much they could say to make it better."}
{"text":"We went here for a friends birthday.   I had the goat cheese and beat salad with steak.  The steak that was in the salad was tasteless and \"fatty\".  For a lack of better words I had to \"spit out\" the steak in my napkin because it was so chewy and fatty. They never asked what kind of dressing I wanted. I just assumed it would come with a vinegar based dressing.  The salad came with ranch.  Goat cheese and ranch do not go well together ....I would have definitely chosen a different meal. But I was not that hungry that's why I chose the salad option ... for $17 dollars.  The only reason I'm giving this place 3 stars is the service was fast and friendly and my husbands veal parmigiana was tasty. And they gave my friend a wine glass filled with cotton candy for his birthday. I would definitely go with another option . Overpriced"}
{"text":"Came here for a lovely lunch on my Mother's bday.  We had the hummus app, burgers, and salad!  The food was really good and worth the wait.  The hummus was really good.  The chips came out really hot and fresh.  The view really makes this restaurant a must to visit.  We thought it would be really cool to look at the stadium while watching the Steeler game on the tv."}
{"text":"Visiting with my family from France so I checked the reviews to make sure they'd like the food and not just the view (fantastic one at that!). Definitely worth the trip up the incline -even with that burly lady in charge of incline ticketing- Come for the view, return for the food! Friendly service, maybe on the slow side that day but they make up for it with their conversation. Party of five so we covered quite a bit of dishes and everybody returns to France with good memories of Pittsburgh dining. That was the point. Keep at it folks!"}
{"text":"Spectacular view, not the best service, food was ok. Alfredo chicken tortellini was enormous and way too cheesy and saucy for my liking. It's great for the view, but don't expect the server to know much about the dish or daily specials, or to know which wine should be served to which guest. If it were up to me, I wouldn't need to go back. Once was plenty."}
{"text":"Great food.  One of our steaks was over cooked but the manager took care of it and provided a nice desert to boot.  Would highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"It's too bad we had to give this place 2 stars, we really wanted to like it.  Very friendly staff and a great view of the city.  But my chicken came out raw, not just undercooked, straight raw.  My wife's gnocchi was undercooked and were mushy little balls of dough.  The manager made sure my chicken was cooked thoroughly and to make up the fact that my $24 meal was raw offered to buy me dessert.  It was a nice gesture but I don't think it was an appropriate response.  We're not the type of people to raise a fuss so we accepted the dessert and went on our way.  We are in town visiting so due to the fact we don't live here we won't be going back, but, if we did live here we probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"The name says it all.  Views are amazing food was pretty good. I would recommend this place in any scenario where you want to give someone a good view of the city.  I'll definitely be back.  ---Get a good table !---"}
{"text":"Hey- this place is just fine. Amazing views of the city and reasonable prices and a big menu. It's not fine dining, but you're paying for the view of the city at the top of the mountain, and I highly recommend this restaurant for any one who is on a date, looking to have a meal or a drink, or just by yourself for a treat. The staff are very friendly. I've eaten here a few times. The salads are great! The pastas are okay. A burger is 15 bucks. This place is just a nice find for anyone who wants to enjoy Pittsburgh. Take the Duquesne incline."}
{"text":"Had a late reservation here for New Year's Eve, overall, it was a great night. The restaurant is new and I always give the benefit to new places. The menu was great but they overbooked and ran out of a few menu items, not a problem, because we found other items. The food was great aside from the salads which were inconsistent and the dressing was oily. The servers were good but the table set ups were sporadic and they were running around like crazy. The bar was swamped but the drinks were consistently great. They only things stopping that fifth star was the lack of food and overwhelmed servers. I will be back to this great new restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing service. The view is fantastic!! Come for a great time. Our server Nate made it a fun lunch and we will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Celebrated my daughter's graduation from Carnegie Mellon at this restaurant with 11 guests. The restaurant staff was very accommodating. Both the owner and the chef came to our table and introduced themselves which made us feel very welcomed. It was almost as if we were dining in someone's home instead of a restaurant. The service was excellent as was the food and the view. I highly recommend the osso bucco and the scallops in particular. Should you find yourself in Pittsburgh, please make your way to this restaurant. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This was a great find. Received a smile and a welcoming handshake. The manager, Joe, was great. Friendly and made us feel like we were at his home. Our server was on top of his game as well. The food was very good. Good burgers with the most amazing fries. \"They're battered.\" Joe says.  Give this place serious consideration for lunch or dinner. Tasty treats.  The view is also one of the best in town."}
{"text":"A bit pricey for the quality of food but the view makes up for it. Good atmosphere and good food just not worth $70 for surf and turf."}
{"text":"Went for the views and the menu looked good. Views good but all behind glass. No deck. And food was way over priced and not that great. Server was nice though."}
{"text":"Been here an hour an a half and have yet to have our dinners served.  Just learned that our waitresses tables were all put on hold because they had several large parties that took precedence then was told they completely lost my dinner order.  WTF?  We're here celebrating my wife's 50th and we're told we'd be taken care of.  Sure were.  NOTTT!!!!  Update.  Food finally served after 1:50.   Food was mediocre at best.  The manager did comp the entire meal for our inconvenience.  Some 50th Birthday for my wife tho.  Don't get a redo on that one."}
{"text":"While staying at the William Penn, the bartender told us to go to Mount Washington for dinner and told us to go to Altius, they were all booked up so we stumbled upon Vue a few spots down. So happy we did, we had an amazing dinner.  The view of downtown was beautiful and the food was delicious. I had the salmon and my fiance had the filet mignon. The bottle of cabernet we ordered was excellent and a really good price, as were the martinis we had.   The service was impeccable. Nathan our waiter was so accommodating and on point. We were there for a while and not once did we feel rushed. We are from New York and were in Pittsburgh for Memorial Day Weekend. He recommended a few bars for us to hit after, which we did and they were awesome! I'd definitely come back on my next visit."}
{"text":"Not too pricey for the view and atmosphere. Food was delicious and it came out fast. My boyfriend took me here for my birthday and they reserved us a table that overlooks the city and gave me a free glass of cotton candy with a sparkler!   The only con was the menu only offers prime rib on Saturdays (we came on a Wednesday, and we're huge carnivores/prime rib fans). We also got our appetizer before the bread  other than that, would definitely return"}
{"text":"I made a reservation to Vue 412 to celebrate my boyfriends birthday. We are new to Pittsburgh and I surprised him with some family that came in town and a ride up the Duquesne Incline topped off with dinner at Vue 412. In preparation I called to reserve a window table and to have a printed custom message on our menus (the hostess happily confirmed on the phone). Needless to say I was extremely disappointed that, upon arrival (10 mins early), there was not a reserved window seat AND there were no printed menus because \"they've been busy and didn't have time\" (per the hostess). Mind you, I only received explanation after being seated and asking her. I wanted the night to be special so I didn't make a fuss. On to the next, except no so easy, no drinks after 10 minutes so the hostess brings us water. 15 more minutes and our waiter shows up to take drink and appetizer orders. A couple wrong drinks (sigh) and one wrong appetizer (grrr). At this point everyone at my table is a bit on edge - and unfortunately this was my \"fine dining\" plan for my boyfriend's birthday. Okay, okay, on to dinner - we finally receive dinner (one bottle of wine is topped during this wait). THE BIRTHDAY GUY's steak is not what he ordered!!!! Can I also mention the steak brought to his was a NY Strip and cooked to \"chef's temp\" which was well done. OMG what chef anywhere recommends well done?! I digress. Around this point the server tells us how hard fine dining is and we all discuss how loosely the term fine dining is used here. So that's our story - the service is terrible (servers and hostess are not very attentive), and even if your server writes everything down you may not get what you ordered. If you're cool with that, the food is decent and there is definitely a nice \"vue\". If service matters, this may not be the place for you. There was one staff member (not our server or the hostess) who regularly refilled our drinks - he was awesome!"}
{"text":"Fantastic meal at Vue 412. Highly recommend the lamb small plate. We shared several small plates-crab, scallops, hummus-all were delicious and beautifully presented. Entrees included Osso Bucco and shrimp Roman- so good!  Service was great too-we love a waiter with a sense of humor. And the view is amazing!  Overall it's more cozy than the standards on mt Washington. Our new favorite!"}
{"text":"Had the cowboy steak and the creme brûlée and they were both amazing.  The steak was cooked gorgeously and the brûlée had that amazing crust on top. Wine was good and the service was amazing. Not to mention the breathtaking views of Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"This was a great random restaurant we found.  The location is great and had a wonderful view of the Pittsburgh skyline.  The picture I posted doesn't reflect it properly.  The host sat us in a wonderful seat, we didn't have a reservation, and Lani was our server. We where immediately greeted, however service was slow throughout the rest of the meal as we never received water refills and it took us a while to order our drinks after putting in our food order. The food however was delicious. My sister and I split the crabcakes which were huge and perfect to share. My brother had spaghetti and meatballs which had a nice flavored sauce and my mother had the squash with scallops that were yummy.  We ordered dessert, having cheesecake, crème brûlée, and tiramisu. We had two Groupon for $20 but we're only allowed to use one, however Lani was very nice and had the Manger signed the other one so we could use it at a future visit.  Overall great experience even if the service was slow, I will return."}
{"text":"New menu is fantastic! Complete departure from the red sauce heavy previous menu. Everything is fresh and light and flavorful. The new chefs really know how to put out top notch food."}
{"text":"Vegans Rejoice! SERIOUSLY!! We went to this venue expecting to order a salad and what a surprise. Vegans...Chef Mike has you covered. His knowledge and understanding of a vegan diet was right on and so appreciated. We were served the most delicious, filling, pure and healthy meal ever! And the best part, the atmosphere overlooking the city made the whole experience worth the trip. We will definitely dine at Vue 412 any time we are in the area. Thank you Chef Mike."}
{"text":"Today was our first visit to the Vue and it wont be the last. We came for the Easter brunch. We were quickly seated and given coffee, water and juice. The view is the best, the food was delicious and warm, and the service was prompt. Only con was having to walk up 3 flights of stairs to reach the buffet on the 3rd floor. But we made it work!"}
{"text":"Fabulous view, good, delicious comfort food. Tasty cocktails. Wonderful way to end the day."}
{"text":"Beautiful view and amazing food. The service was great, too. The ambience made the restaurant feel intimate. I'd recommend the calamari and lobster mac and cheese!"}
{"text":"Best crab cakes in the city!! Chef Cam is unreal! He's went above and beyond to make our experience a great one!  Jackie the manager is a doll as well!! HIGHLY recommended!!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation thru open table and the restaurant knew nothing about the reservation. The service staff forgot items that were ordered and my daughter found strips of plastic in her shrimp scampi."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for his birthday dinner, and we loved it! We had a great view of the city and sunset and early evening. Our waiter, Joe, was very helpful with our wine selection. We split the meatball appetizer which was very good. He had the filet mignon (which in retrospect, he would have asked to be done medium rare, not medium), which came with mashed potatoes and green beans, and he loved it. I had the gnocchi with sausage and it was incredible! I can't recommend that meal enough. We split the creme brulee for dessert and they also brought us complimentary limoncello, which they make in-house and that was such a lovely treat. If you're concerned about parking, you can find free street parking down one of the side streets, or use the $10 cash lot near the restaurant. If you're visiting Pittsburgh and want a great meal for a great value, definitely go to Vue 412!"}
{"text":"My husband surprised me with dinner here for my birthday! We had amazing service and amazing food and an amazing view!! Meatball Ricotta appetizer was so good and the Filet and the Osso Bucco were perfect! Don't forget dessert... you must try the Death by chocolate!! Yum!! Everything was so great!!"}
{"text":"Wow where to begin! The service was horrible. The waitress started by rolling her eyes when we all order soft drinks. She then informed us that the kitchen was backed up and it would be about an extra 15 minutes. We all agreed. After we gave her our order we asked if we could get some bread while we waited and she said no bread at lunch (after they just said we would need to wait for our meals). After 47 minutes (yes we timed it) and the waitress not coming over once to refill our drinks, 2 of the meals arrived. We had order 3 cheeseburgers and 1 grilled cheese. The first two burgers were cold with non melted cheese. After another 10 minutes, the third cold burger and grilled cheese arrived. The food was horrible. After the food was dropped off the waitress was no where to be found. The only good service we received was from the busboy who filled our drinks and apologized for the wait. This was the WORST service and food I have ever received. Go elsewhere for kind service and good food."}
{"text":"I was amazed at not only the view, but also the food and the service. I made a reservation here for an early celebration for my boyfriend's birthday. I was called the day of to confirm my reservation, which I appreciated. We got to the restaurant on the top of Mount Washington, and there was limited parking, but we actually were able to park in the nearby neighborhood for free (VERY LIMITED). We came on a Saturday night at 7:00pm so that we could see the city during the day, as the sun set, and with the city lights. We were immediately seated at a window table with a beautiful view. Dress is business casual, at the least. The restaurant has some seating that is not windowside as well, but window tables were on a reservation or on a first come, first serve basis. Our waitress (female with dark hair) was extremely attentive and the food came out quickly. My boyfriend started with a Fall Fashioned cocktail and I had a water. We ordered mussels, which were delicious. As soon as we were finished, we got our entrees- salad with grilled shrimp and gnocchi with sausage. We also got strawberry cheesecake for dessert. Because I notified the restaurant that it was his birthday, he got cotton candy in a wine glass with sparklers and was sung happy birthday. This helped make this a wonderful birthday for him. The entire dinner meal was fabulous and I would give it a solid 4 stars. But, the overall restaurant definitely gets all 5 stars for wonderful food, great atmosphere, and wonderful service. We were overall very pleased with our experience and I highly recommend it here!"}
{"text":"Exquisite food! Perfect flavors... Great dishes. Peaceful atmosphere. Obviously a great view of the city! Service was exceptional. Jackie was our server, and she was the best waitress I have ever had. Other people also stopped by our table throughout the night to ask about how we liked the food. It was their second night with their new chef. I'll give him 5 stars!! We were served complimentary \"palate kickstarters\" that were great, as well as a complementary warm bread with an olive and raspberry compote. Delicious. All dishes were served in a very well planned out and spaced out time period. We had time to eat and enjoy each dish as well as visit, but were never waiting on the next dish you come. We left satisfied but not stuffed, and still talking about how in the world they could have created those flavors!"}
{"text":"Just as the name says, you come here for the view!   After taking the Duquesne Incline up to the top, we were looking for some lunch. There are only a handful of restaurants to choose from and it was Labor Day so many were closed. Vue 412 was among those open. We moseyed on in and were seated after waiting about ten minutes.   First things first: The view is unbeatable. We were seated near a window downstairs and it certainly kept us busy while we waited for our food to come.  Where the experience missed the mark was the food (and occasionally the service). Not only did it take really long for our food to come out without an explanation, what did come out was rather underwhelming. I ordered the bistro club and it was nothing to write home about, and I can't say the flatbread or pastas really wowed anyone at my table. The manager came around the table and was super friendly; however, our server was a little spacey and not very knowledgeable when we tried to redeem our check-in offer for a discount on the bill. She took my phone away without asking for about five minutes trying to figure out what to do with it. In the end, they honored it which was much appreciated.   Maybe it was an off day, but in the future, I would try elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!! 2thbs up ..the food was excellent but our waitress was superior (Jennifer) not only was she very prompt on removing old dishes,& quick service but she was very informative on local things to do.and the icing on the cake is it had a spectacular view of all of Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"Gorgeous views. Great food! Service was okay, a little rough around the edges. The interior could be a bit more classy. Overall great experience though."}
{"text":"The portion was good but I had the chicken piccata and the noodles were gummy. I don't recommend it."}
{"text":"First, the service at Vue 412 is incredible.  All employees seem quite knowledgeable about food, drinks, and the establishment's history. The view is incredible as well on both levels.   We both had the scallop entree and they were probably the best scallops I've ever had. They were prepared perfectly and presented beautifully. The bread and spreads that were brought out first were also excellent. They also have a nice wine list. Though vue 412 is pricey, its totally worth it! Thanks for a great evening!"}
{"text":"My experience at Vue 412 was pretty hilarious actually. I went for dinner with my 5 girlfriends. We tried to order a bottle of wine, but every time we chose a wine the waiter would come back to our table and tell us they were out. Literally happened three times. Four of us ordered salads (which are 8 bucks each al la cart) and they didn't come until AFTER our entrees were served. I swear 4 employees kept apologizing about how late the salads were, which is nice, but damn just go get my salad!!! Finally the meals came and everyone really liked their food, but the portions were SO small. Not one of us had anything left over and some of us were still hungry! The staff kept apologizing over and over to the point where it became funny. On a positive note, they took the salads off the bill and even gave us some free deserts! It's a shame that I will never return, because all the food was really good!! Vue 412, seriously... get it together!!!"}
{"text":"Fabulous restaurant! Whiskey filet is so good we went twice in one week for it. Great menu options for casual cheaper meal or expensive fancy night out. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We went to Vue 412 for light up night. I made a reservation two months in advance and asked for a table by the window. We were not seated by the window. The manager apologized and gave us a $25 gift card, which was very nice. However, that was the end of good service. It took a while to get drinks, even after asking only a few of us had our water refilled. It took a long time for our waiter to take our order. He came back 1/2 hour later to say that one person's appetizer was no longer available. We had to ask twice for bread. There were eight of us. After nearly two hours they brought only 3 salads, one of which was wrong and 3 entrees. Even after the manager was politely approached and apologized we didn't get all of the meals or salads. It was the worst restaurant experience we have ever had."}
{"text":"The star rating on this place was tough because our server was great and the food was OK (at best).   We had a good size group and we are very easy to work with. Overall service was good. Energetic and nice although at times some things were forgotten about initially.   Food was OK. Steak cooked well but the sauce tasted burnt. Polenta had no flavor. Shrimp was really good (appetizer). Ossa Bucco was good...not great.  Scallops were good. Sacchetti (Gorgonzola and fig) was very bland. Mashed potatoes and the risottos were OK. Again though they were bland.   View was beautiful as you know it will be. Overall an OK experience mainly because of how nice the server was and the view.   Not sure if It is worth the cost of the meals."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dinner with a beautiful table overlooking the Point.  The service was great and the prices were very reasonable.  We have told our friends how nice it is.  We will be back.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Awful. Don't know how it has good reviews. My filet came out way too well done, had absolutely zero taste to it and my girlfriends chicken pillard was awful, not to mention they gave us the wrong meal at first. The only good part about it was the really nice and fun heavy weighted guy, he's cool."}
{"text":"If you are looking for the PERFECT spot on Mt Washington, or maybe even all of Pittsburgh, this is your place.  The view is what drew us there, but the food is what will keep us going back. I can only speak for my own meal, which was the salmon, but I will assure you that THAT is how salmon is supposed to be prepared. It was absolutely phenomenal.. and I've eaten a lot of salmon- that was by far the best! Everyone else loved their meals as well, and finished every bite.  I had a red sangria as my drink and, again, it was perfect.   Our service was totally on point, and that paired with our amazing view of our beautiful city couldn't have been better.   Just a short walk from the top of the Duquesne Incline and the overlook, the location is very convenient and easy to find and get to. There is a parking lot right across the street that is $10 to use, but makes it much quicker and easier than searching for street parking."}
{"text":"Was only expecting the good view on a snowy night; but found a very friendly staff, JJ & our waiter; but the food was the biggest surprise.. ALL of the entree's, a meat dish, a seafood dish, and an Italian dish were EXCELLENT.  In regards to pricing, $10 more per plate than an Applebee's for the view and food quality is a no brainer. Will absolutely be back on my next return trip."}
{"text":"WOW! Yesterday my sister and I had the pleasure to dine at VUE412. Devan was so gracious and made us feel special as we arrived and were seated.  Joe,the manager, was so friendly and accommodating. We were helped with our food selections with Jennifer, our exceptional waitress!  We started with appetizers such as the crispy BadaBing shrimp with a special spicy sauce. Next was the stuffed banana peppers served in a skillet, and next the fried calamari with roasted garlic olive oil,red peppers,banana peppers with saffron aioli. All the appetizers were so flavorful. JENNIFER recommended the \"special\" for the evening and it was Surf & Turf. OMG!!!!!!! It was the BEST we have ever  eaten. The filet was cooked to perfection and soooo delicious! The lobster tail was stuffed with crab meat also so fresh and oh so mouth watering. The entrée was accompanied with tricolor carrots and roasted potatoes. The chef,BRYAN,has been there for 6 months and has brought the menu to new heights.JOE, along with his staff have elevated this restaurant's culinary skills!!!!!"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed.  We went in @ 5Pm on Saturday, June 4th.  Server was pleasant, but brut the wrong  wine. We had to flag down another server  (after 10 minutes) to get this correced.  The busses were hanging out in the restaurant and seemed to just be waiting.   The appetizer took too long and was extremely small for the price..plus the dressing was simply mayonnaise from a jar.  We each ordered a salad with grilled chicken and that took a very  long time.  The Salad was OK, but really mediocre. When we left, we observed kitchen staff seated at a table next to the front door on  smoke break. Not acceptable. This place needs to improve."}
{"text":"As an update, my husband and I joined 4 friends here for dinner overlooking the 4th of July fireworks. Sadly, my overall impression hasn't improved. The food - crab cakes and scallops - was very good, but the overall experience was lack luster. We made reservations months in advance, requesting window seats, which was not honored. I understand they can't make such a guarantee, but when we later saw the hostess sitting down at a table of 6 by the windows to watch the fireworks, we were not thrilled. We kept having to remind the server that we had ordered another drink or to bring the bread and oil. They were also out of several menu drink and food items, advising their deliveries didn't arrive as anticipated."}
{"text":"My family and I had a great experience at Vue 412! We made a reservation a few days in advance, and upon arrival our reservation was no where to be found in the system. However, the staff was quick to find us a table, and then even gave us a table that was sort of in its own room with a great view of the city. The staff and owner checked on us to make sure we were doing all right and offered to take a photo of us with downtown Pittsburgh in the background. When the food came out there was one dish that was cold, but our waitress took it back and later brought up an hot version that was clearly just made, which was appreciated. Other than that initial issue everyone in our family was happy with their meal."}
{"text":"Extremely surprised! We knew the view would be great but the food and service was excellent. Surf n turf perfectly cooked, fresh, vegetables crisp, tiramisu Good."}
{"text":"The \"Vue\" is about the only good thing about this place! We were met at door by the hosted who had extreme RBF. We were at at a table with plates with actual food particle stuck on the plate. After requesting bread several times a very small loaf came out. Service was so incredibly slow and lacking, actually it could not be considered service because our drinks were never refilled, our server never checked on us, the small amount of ketchup that was in the ramekin obviously ran out after a few fries.  As I'm writing this review right now we are still waiting on our bill we requested God only know how long ago. Seriously go anywhere else, this place will ruin your trip up the inclined railroad."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful night with my girlfriend. We really enjoyed the night view and foods. Services were friendly and kind, food is delicious, price is reasonable! Recommended for a dating"}
{"text":"We came here for our anniversary dinner and it was everything we hoped for. The ambience was reserved and warm. The food was exceptional - the scallops were the best we've had, the ravioli was really good and the tiramisu at the end topped it all off. We also got courtesy shots and a sparkler in cotton candy courtesy of the hotel owing to our anniversary. We would definitely come back and highly recommend the place!!"}
{"text":"Went here for drinks before dinner down the street. Bar and restaurant is very dated and old. Sat at the bar in the basement and was immediately greeted by the bartender cussing out the previous bartender for leaving such a mess. Turns out the old bartender was moving to be a server and the two of them continued arguing right in front of us. How unprofessional. A glass was broken behind the bar and they continued the sarcasm and arguing before finally cleaning it up. Bartender didn't have a clue what an IPA was and kept calling it a pilsner. To top it all off, we overheard the manager saying to the staff that they were cancelling happy hour that night since they were too busy and unprepared. I've never heard of a restaurant doing such a thing. The drinks were good but the service, or lack there of, was atrocious. We will never be back for this reason. Take your money down the street to Monterrey Bay Fish Grotto for a better view and overall experience."}
{"text":"We agreed with others, Liz and Joe were great.  The only issue we had was the temperature of the food.  Quantity and choices of the food we had for the restaurant week were great.  But when the food comes out either just warm or trying to be not cold, that takes away from tasting the flavors and truly enjoying a nice meal. That said....Liz and Joe assisted with that concern but I make note of it here for the kitchen as for now, I'm not positive I would go back considering the true cost of a meal here vs the food that was served. But, overall I note I'm a fan so....we'll probably give them another try."}
{"text":"This place should get a 5 star for the experience we had. It was fairly later in the evening after being really busy in the late afternoon when we called to see if we could make reservations. We walked right in and we were seated quickly right after the long bout of trying to find a parking spot; but you know men - they will find a spot no matter how long it takes. (Lol) There were no other people in the place. I enjoy getting dressed up and going to eat, but this night was a little more exciting when we had a spectacular view; wonder where they got the name? I thought the place was bigger because there were mirrors everywhere, but when we left - I realized it was pretty small. Unless there was another floor that I missed. I think that there were a good many options for dinner but I was really craving Italian. I went with the veal Parmesan which I've been without for a long time. Kind of disheartening to see other reviews that had a bad time because I really liked this place. Our waitress was super nice and did everything correctly. It was not a long wait for food, the appetizer was just enough along with the bread and olive oil that was served. My veal was really good. The dessert was a lemon cake and it was seriously so good. I was happy with all the selections. It's really close to Mt. Washington park/look out area with the skyline view which we would've spent more time at but it was literally freezing. Luckily, I was warmed up by my hand being held."}
{"text":"The food is really bad. View is okay. But the food is very very bad. Noodle is so hard, steak is very dry. No taste. 3 of us ordered 3 dishes, none of us liked it."}
{"text":"** Overpriced and very mediocre food, nothing special except the view. Better off checking out one of the other incline resturants.  I came here on Valentine's Day with my girlfriend, scheduling around 5:15 pm hoping to enjoy a nice meal and watch the sunset together (yes I know, cheesy af). It was too bad that it was rainy that day, which definitely obstructed the view, but theres not much they can do about it. Later on in the night, they definitely turned on too many lights inside which caused a bad glare on the windows to make the view hard to see which was 90% of the reason I came. Going with a dim light would make for both a more intimate experience as well as a better view in my opinion.   It was nice that we were provided window seats upon arriving, as well as a flower for my girl and coat service. However, I do have to say that the interior just didn't really match my expectations of it being a nice restaurant on the incline. A lot of the tables seemed out of place for the more upscale ambiance I expected it to have for being on the incline, especially compared to places like Le Mont, which looks and makes you feel very lavish for dining at.   I mainly choose this place for the view, and the food didn't really seem up to par with the hype or prices. We both ordered the 14 ounce prime rib entrees, as well as one lobster bisque and a merlot, the total coming a bit over $100 (no discounts were taking unfortunately for check in or groupon). We did eat on the Valentine's Day menu, so naturally prices were marked up, but in my opinion the food was extremely average and nothing special.   I will say that I am satisfied with the amount of meat that came with it, but something seemed off about the flavor and both me and my girlfriend ended up not finishing ours as some areas just didn't taste great for lack of better words. Even if this place is advertised to be more casual, I would have expected the prices to match that, but unfortunately I found this place to be very overpriced and overhyped."}
{"text":"Visited during restaurant week. We had a party of 9-7adults and 2 young children.  They gave us the enclosed patio room with an amazing view.  The restaurant week menu was varied with choice.  I had the salad with frisée, pears, goat cheese and walnuts.  Amazing.  Then the mahi mahi with porcini tortellini and asparagus.  The portions were Perfect and the entree was wonderful!   Dessert was the chocolate torte- delicious.  Our waiter, Nathan, was fun, professional and extremely accommodating- even great with the kids.   The ambience is nice but nothing over the top.  The only (semi) con, was the slow service.  We sat down at 7 and didn't receive our entrees until 8:05.  They did provide wonderful bread with a scrumptious dipping oil.  I do have to add that although the service was slow, they were quick with the kids meals, and which is always a good thing.   Summary... great views, nice ambience, great waiter, and delicious food!   Just expect to wait a while for your main entree.  Unless you're under 10 years old :).  Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Awesome food and drinks!  Our waiter, Nathan made everything amazing for my birthday. We will be going back!  Also, the owner came around and asked how everything was, which was an extra special touch."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant with friends mainly for the view- it certainly did not disappoint in that regard. The food was mediocre at best, a bit cold as if they heated it up (but not well enough). We ordered the eggplant rollatini and the hummus platter for appetizers. Skip the rollatini (cold, not fresh) but the hummus platter was very good. The parmesan chicken was decent- a large portion definitely enough to share. The service was fine but the waitstaff seemed to have beef with each other which was a bit awkward. The lighting kept going in and out so most of the time it was very dark- perhaps just a kink that the new restaurant needs to work out. Overall, the view was amazing but the food, service and ambiance were subpar."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for Thanksgiving dinner.  Everything was very good.   The staff were cordial and personable!   The stuffing, mac and cheese and gravy were particularly good."}
{"text":"Great service, food, and view. What more could you ask for? We really had a terrific meal and enjoyed our view of the city. We enjoyed the Charcuterie and Fromage starter followed by crab cakes and Osso Bucco- all terrific."}
{"text":"We came here for Valentine's Day and I was really impressed with the food! There was a lot of fog so we didn't really get to see that famous view for most of the night, but the fog went away for just a little to be able to see the beautiful city! We ordered shrimp cocktail for an appetizer and it was amazing. For our entrees, my boyfriend got the Prime Rib (a server accidentally spilled the juice on me, but another server came with club soda to dab my dress immediately which was really nice of her, accidents happen), and I got the Lobster Ravioli. Both were very delicious. I will be back to try the Lobster Mac & Cheese and see the view for real!"}
{"text":"EHH. Really empty spot, but you pay for the view.  The 4 of us cracked open a bottle of white wine- forgot what it's called, but it had some lychee flavor in it. Not bad!   STARTERS: 1) Ceviche ($22):  -1 super small portion,  +1 but a delicious variety of seafood.  -1 A bit too sour for my liking, though.  -1 I'm surprised they don't even provide chips or something with this...  SALADS: 1) Butter poached lobster ($22): -1 Butter lettuce looks like something I could buy from Safeway (which is probably the case) +1 Lobster looks dank though! Pretty decent portion size.   ENTREES: 1) SCALLOPS ($28): +1 Oh danggg. Delicious, big chunks. One of the more pricier dishes, but a good blend of flavors.  2) SALMON ($24): +1 Generous slice! They took a while to make this one because the first piece was too small. How considerate of them!  3) SHORT RIB ($25): +1 Short rib is soft and definitely slow cooked for a while.  -1 However, the sauce didn't play well..also, usually the short rib is supposed to soak up flavors. This was hella dry/bland.   Overall, the service was not bad. Super friendly, and definitely feels like someone's home that was just renovated (the bathroom feels like my grandma's). I wouldn't be dying to come here, but I like how personable they all are."}
{"text":"3 stars for the duck entree and the friendly staff. Shrimp and lobster meal was not good- have had better at Red Lobster. Too pricey for the overall quality of the food. Nice view but partially blocked by LeMont. Drink prices seemed reasonable so will probably go back for a drink sometime."}
{"text":"Excellent experience and food. Manager personally visited our table several times to be sure everything was going right. Took us upstairs to the beautiful 3rd floor for a photo op. How special?! Great food for all of us as well! We got the \"Bistro Club\" sandwich and the \"Blackened Prime Rib\" sandwich for lunch both were superb!"}
{"text":"Came during restaurant week, excellent food paired with exceptional service. Most of the dining area offers an incredible view of the city. Dim lighting and music played at a tolerable volume, definitely recommended"}
{"text":"Had a special birthday party there for 13 people.  Service was wonderful and attentive.    Bottles of wine not too overpriced.   Loved the cioppino.  Desserts huge!!  Can't wait to come back.   Their other restaurant just as good if you can't get in here!"}
{"text":"Vue 412. Upon walking in, I was greeted by a very nice host. He was extremely friendly and I love that kind of service. Our waiter and waitress were both very nice as well! A welcoming environment is always a plus when eating out!   As a whole, I have to be honest . . . Vue 412 was a miss for me. My family and I ate an early dinner (about 5pm) and the dining room was full of commotion while we were seated with employees prepping for the evening service. That should've happened earlier in the day - not after you open for dinner service. It was very bizarre. That kind host (was he the owner?) even had an altercation with an employee within earshot of our table . . .   Awkward.   Our waiter was very kind and then was absent for a long time and then we received a new waitress.   I still hope he's okay . . .   The food was really just okay. I'm glad the price-point wasn't any higher, but my meal was a $15 plate at best - not the $25 I paid (veal piccata). I tasted a bite of my wife's meal (salmon) and it really tasted good! The desserts were also very tasty and veryyy nicely presented!   We were in there for close to 2 hrs. Everything. Took. For. Ev. E. R.   The view was incredible and why the restaurant got 3 stars instead of 2! The inside decor, however, is a bit strange. It has a hint of fine dining with butcher paper on the tables...it just doesn't quite fit. Visual esthetic in a restaurant is something very important to me when dining out, and I really thought on more than a handful of occasions that Vue is a bit of a missed opportunity.   I see Vue as a place with a ton of potential! They have the location, which is more than 3/4 the battle (location, location, locat...). Nail the decor, button up the professionalism in the dining room, develop a more cohesive menu, quicken the service . . . You'll compete with the best of them and make a killing doing it. I want that for these guys because they're really nice!"}
{"text":"I went with my friend during Restaurant Week. We were actually trying to use a Groupon I bought weeks earlier (tip: they're not open Monday and Tuesday so if you get the Groupon keep that in mind).  Parking: pay street parking or there is a lot across the street for $10  We were seated by the window and it was such a fantastic view! Our waiter was so personable, helpful and honest.   I started out with the shrimp bisque since it was like 20 degrees outside. It was so warm and velvety. My friend got the steamed mussels with sausage and it was freaking yuuuuge! A meal in and of itself!  I had the seafood trio with pappardelle. It consisted of creamy soft scallops, a white fish (cod i thunk) and giant prawns. I don't think the pasta was homemade though.   For dessert we had a creme brûlée and a piece of cheesecake!  I will definitely be back for happy hour and to try my Groupon haha!"}
{"text":"The view is amazing and the dessert was excellent. The filet mignon was tender but cooked strange and the chicken romana lacked sauce and flavor. Excellent service view and dessert but just average food."}
{"text":"The chef is very friendly. Food was awesome. I got the NY Strip cooked perfectly at medium."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the more affordable restaurants with a stunning view, but that is relative. That kind of real estate means expensive menus, so it's not a value decision, you go for an experience. That being said you cannot beat the view!  Friendly service. Food could have been a little more consistent n quality for price."}
{"text":"We went as a last minute place after going up the tram on a Sunday afternoon. The view was beautiful. The service was outstanding and our favorite part of the restaurant. It does not have a kids menu but Dan, the server made us feel comfortable with our 4 year old son. I got the French bistro burger, This is a great burger. The Chef just changed the burger recipe (I hope she keeps it). My husband got the special Reuben which was good."}
{"text":"Gorgeous view, beautiful entree's and even better dessert! Server was great as well. Wonderful place to go and enjoy your dates company with some good conversation!"}
{"text":"Great service and food, their lobster mac and cheese was awesome. The view is amazing"}
{"text":"Went to Vue 412 for restaurant week.  Usually when I go anywhere during this event you get subpar service.  This was not the case at Vue.  We didn't get a window seat but still had a great view from the elevated dining area on the main entrance floor.  We didn't feel like we were on top of other couples like some places.  The ambiance was great and the staff was friendly.  Patrick was an excellent server! The owner also said hello which was a nice touch.  We loved the food.  My fiancé upgraded to filet and crab cakes which were great and I was pleased with the seafood trio.  Big shrimp & scallops- well worth the $$.  Drinks were Avg price.  $9 for Riesling and a draft blue moon.  Great time! Had a great date night!"}
{"text":"We had a lunch reservation for two with prime window seating for a fabulous view of the confluence. The pasta and bistro club were delicious. Service was great. We were not rushed into leaving at all. Would definitely recommend for anyone looking for a slightly upscale but comfortable restaurant atop Mt. Washington"}
{"text":"What a pleasant lunch Christmas Eve.  I have to confess we were headed to my go-to restaurant atop Mt. Washington, that of Grandview Saloon.  However, it was not open for lunch so saw Vue 412's sidewalk blackboard announcing its specials so headed inside.    My husband and I were cordially greeted by owner or manager perhaps? I do not know but he seemed very gracious in seating us and checking on us later at our table.  The menu had plenty of enticing options.  I went for a special -- barramundi fish with green beans and potatoes.  The fish was mild and fatty -- very tasty.  Presentation was very eye-pleasing.  And the prices for lunch (until 3pm) was very fair.  Everything I saw on the menu was in the 13.00 to 15.00 range.  Even the dinner menu options looked fairly priced in the 20's to low 30's.    Opted for the Death by Chocolate to split between the two of us and it was huge and very good, chocolaty and moist.  There was a 10 percent discount for checking into Yelp, as well.  Oh, did I forget to mention the view???  Wonderful view of the point, downtown, and the north shore.  Note that there is no outside dining when it comes time for nicer weather, but a nice venue for indoor dining.  Oh, just a P.S.  Our server was fun and outgoing but we had to watch out for anything liquid he placed in front of us, as in coffee or refilling water.  He was definitely a serious slosher/splasher.  Nervous, medical, or holiday cheer?  All was good, nonetheless!"}
{"text":"My review is not really what it was like dining here, but more of how my stomach felt afterwards.  The restaurant is beautiful, though not handicap friendly. There are two floors of tables (lower and first floor) with a beautiful view of Pittsburgh. The bathrooms are located on the second floor.  My fiancé and I ordered a lobster Mac and cheese dish and the salmon with fig. The salmon was great. The Mac and cheese had so much cheese it seemed more like a fondue pot.  Waking up this morning, my fiancé, his sister, and I have been dealing with major stomach issues. Hopefully we'll all feel better tomorrow."}
{"text":"My husband and I came for dinner. My food was delicious and steaming hot when it arrived so I personally would have rated it 5 stars. The only thing I noticed that was incorrect regarding my food was that the crab cake appetizer stated it came with a \"spicy\" remoulade. It was in no way spicy but being that I am not someone who loves spicy food I was fine with it. My husband on the other hand would have rated it a 2. His meatball appetizer came out cold. When they brought it out the second time it was lukewarm. Then minutes later our dinner came which was unfortunate for him because now he has 2 things to eat that have 2 different sauces so eating them together was not great on the taste buds. Again, my dinner was steaming. He got the gnocchi and Italian sausage and it was again, just warm. Also, it was supposed to be served with a vodka tomato cream sauce and it was not creamy at all. It looked real thin and greasy. They got real busy after we got there so he decided to just suck it up and eat what he could then have to wait for his entrée to be corrected. When we left he said he wouldn't want to come back. Being that I enjoyed my food, I was thinking who I would bring back with me! The view was gorgeous. No complaints there!"}
{"text":"We tried this place during restaurant week. The service was spotty (we were served over the banister? We got our bread halfway through the meal?) and the food was meh at best. The fish dishes ordered (salmon and bass) were the best part of the meal and came with nice vegetable sides. Lobster bisque was fine. Lobster ravioli was pretty good. Everyone seemed apologetic about the bland, room temperature creme brûlée that 3 of us had ordered and they brought us some complementary tiramisu after we reported how bad it was. It seemed like they genuinely wanted to provide good food and service but aren't quite there. My inlaws reported being unable to drink the coffee. The views were nice, though! If you want to come to the views, go for it, but just be aware that they are better than the food. You have to walk up multiple flights of stairs to get to the bathroom, so watch out for that, too, if you are not physically able."}
{"text":"My friends and I went here before Cirque du Soleil, and it was a wonderful time all around. The arancini and barrata appetizers were spot on: the risotto was cooked perfectly and had a savory crunchy shell, and the barrata cheese was served with hazelnuts roasted to perfection and honey which was a great combination. For dinner, I had the branzino, which I cannot recommend highly enough. The skin was crispy, the meat cooked perfectly, all served over a delectable ratatouille of tomatoes, carrots and zucchini. Everyone else in my party loved their dishes but was jealous of mine haha. I also enjoyed two of their Rye and Boulevard, and Manhattan-like cocktail that was right up my alley. Of course, the view was amazing, even during the daytime. Our server was attentive and helpful and our dishes arrived promptly. I'll also add that, when I left my debit card in a check book, the manager went above and beyond to help me locate it. By the time I was able to stop back, I saw the view at night, which was even more incredible. I would definitely recommend Vue 412 for anyone who's not necessarily looking for a Le Mont level experience, but after amazing good at a fair price point."}
{"text":"Six of us decided to try Vue 412 for Restaurant week based on the published fixed course menu.  We had a 7:45 reservation which likely factored into our frustrating experience whereby (1) the 3 of us who had order the Sea Bass were told 30 minutes after ordering that they had run out; (2) one person ordering a Pinot Noir with dinner was told they had run out; and (3) the 4 of us who had ordered Creme Brûlée from the dessert options were told... yep, they had run out.  I can understand a restaurant running out of certain entrees, but why would the server not be informed in a timely manner.  Same for the desserts.  And how does a restaurant run out of a wine that's served by the glass?  The food, when we did get it, was tasty enough.  And the server was very apologetic for the problems.  Still, it was very frustrating as we had come to the restaurant based on their published menu and most of us had to compromise on what we ordered. That, plus the long wait times, made for a less than satisfying experience.  The manager came over late in the ordeal and apologized for our 'inconvenience' and offered a 10% discount.  However, his apology fell flat and the discount seemed like a token amount given their failure to deliver on food and service."}
{"text":"Horrible birthday dinner!  Waited approximately 30 minutes to order.  I advised the waitress I need gluten free selections. A party of 5 we ordered appetizers and cocktails salad soup and dinners. Again I reminded the waitress I must have gluten free. She assured me that the chef is aware and on the menu it is marked .  Never received the appetizers, received the soup and salad. Waited another 40 minutes and were served the entrees.  Again I asked the waitress is this gluten free. She said yes. As I was eating I knew it wasn't.  The manager came over and said he would check , never came back!  No apology.  We received our check with the appetizers on it.  What a terrible dining experience at expensive pricing. I would never go back. The way they handled THEIR mistake was totally unacceptable!"}
{"text":"The service is Terrible.  We used our Open Table App to make a reservation for 8 pm.  Got their 15 minutes early; but waited at the bar until 9 pm.  The Hostess never communicated with us.  After some drinks at the bar,  we finally left hungry and upset.  It ruined a perfect day.  My child committed to Pitt and we were celebrating. View was wonderful ,  but not worth to headaches.  To make matters worse,  they didn't acknowledge my reservation with Open Table so we didn't get our 100 points!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this 4 stars because of the view.  It's breathtaking.  The food is just ok.  Service is great though."}
{"text":"At the top of the incline, amazing view. The food though was dissaponting. Flatbread was bland with no spices. The pasta was overcooked."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant!  View is outstanding!  But the food was great as well.  Went there on April 1 for our anniversary and they couldn't have been nicer.  Great wait staff and the chef herself came out to ask how everything was.  All too often, food on mount Washington is mediocre.  But with Vue 412, the food was excellent as was the service.  Highly recommend.  We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Saturday night - bright lights! Big cities! Nature Boy! Woooooo!! Looking at places to eat on a Saturday night after a long day of shopping and a nap - came across this spot due to the view and recommendation upon taking requests from my party.   We called ahead to see about reservations around 8 and the gent on the tele told me to come in they had gotten slow since the dinner crowd. Low key worried me that 8pm on a Saturday the place would be slow.   At any rate we headed up the side of the hill and drove up to find that parking is a nightmare. A next door restaurant has valet and a parking garage etc - this spot didn't. Took some hunting but we found a spot on a side street and walked up. The place was slow - kitchen closes at 10, we had gotten there around 8:35 and were sat next to a window that overlooks the whole city. This is the main reason that people come, and was already worth it - but decided to give the food a try as well.   Waitress (tight ponytail and bow tie?) was very attentive, inviting and accommodating. Very big fan of her skills and making us feel welcome.   Ordered a mixed drink (fall fashioned) and a caprese salad for a starter. The drink was good - specialty mixed drink they had on a special menu. The caprese salad was good - just enough of tomato, basil, and balsamic to share. Plus dinner came with bread and an oil olive concoction to share.   For an entree, went with \"Parmesan Chicken\" which is chicken parmigiana - be sure of naming practice and with recommendation of waitress fired on linguine instead of gnocchi and got it without mushrooms. This dish was very good - well prepared and season properly. The chicken was breaded well and roped with cheese as usual- and the chicken was crispy. Plus the sauce / gravy was nice combination of chunky tomato and a medium grade thickness.   For dessert - we went with a nice lemon cello marscapone cake which was like heaven on a plate. Cake and cream was perfect, topped with powdered sugar, and plated with a lemon curd sauce drizzle and a stiff peak of whipped cream.   Overall this meal had it all- a perfect view, a quiet Italian restaurant that Billy Joel would sing about, good food, great service, perfect dessert, and a dream across the table. I would say next time we will come back in warmer months to give the views a walking chance."}
{"text":"Terrible decision to go to this place for Valentine's day dinner.   First of all, we choose this place for the view, so unable to be provide a window seat is definitely a bummer, especially when we reserved a window seat but didn't get it. We reserved on their website and requested a window seat, but when we got there, we've been told that we can't have a window seat.  Then we get to sit in front of a very dirty mirror, which was disgusting to look at.  For the food, we didn't have much expectations. Still it is surprisingly bad. The steak and salmon wasn't fresh, and both over-cooked. Even the signature cake \"Death by chocolate\" was just an ordinary chocolate cake, I'd rather go to Cheesecake Factory. And the price was 87 dollars for 2.  Moreover, the service was below average. Servers barely asked if we need anything. And we waited 20 minutes for the check.  Overall, it was a very disappointing experience. Won't go again and won't recommend anyone to go."}
{"text":"Took my wife and family here for the Mother's Day brunch. The staff did well in seating us on the top floor in a private room with a full view of the city. FANTASTIC!!  My wife was very happy with the venue and the brunch was good. The place was very crowded but the overall experience was memorable and a great value!!  We will be back."}
{"text":"The food and views are awesome, but our experience was meh.   Her entree was brought out several minutes before mine. I wouldn't expect that at Eat'n'Park, much less a place that serves up $35 entrees. My medium rare steak had absolutely no pink in it. Then our soups we ordered to start our meals came out about 10 minutes after we were both well into our plates. Very disappointing for a restaurant of this caliber. No heads up that the soup was still being prepared, just dropped off well into our staggered meal. Had any of that been mentioned beforehand it would've been an afterthought, but we had assumed the server just forgot to put them in until we got them towards the end of our meal.  My meal still tasted great, as did hers, but mine wasn't cooked as I had requested and the service was just disorganized. It's a new place with a presumably new staff so I'm sure there's going to be growing pains. I'll go back, but my experience would've been incredibly disappointing if not for the quality of the meal. Here's hoping they work the kinks out."}
{"text":"We stopped in here after taking the Duquesne Incline up, and we were blown away by the view inside the restaurant. We didn't have anything to eat, but the beer selection was amazing. They had TVs on so we could watch the World Cup and the service behind the bar was fantastic. The owner gave us lots of backstory to some of the buildings that we could see from the view as we mentioned we are Canadian and don't know much history of the city. Just a fantastic little spot and we regret not having lunch because the food looked amazing."}
{"text":"One of the few places I've been to with a world class view AND incredible food at a reasonable price.  I'd eat this food at this price at a freeway side strip in an Ohio suburb.  Lonnie was a great server!"}
{"text":"Only thing good about this place is the view. Horrible service, less than mediocre over priced food."}
{"text":"The scallops were delicious.  The crab cakes were so-so.  The Dover sole special was just ok. There is a cocktail made with Effie orange vodka.  I highly suggest you try it.  Our server Sarah was excellent.  The only downside was, I had purchased a Groupon and didn't realize that it was not good on Sat night.  I asked our server to ask her manager and the manager said \" absolutely not.\"  An I'm sorry would have been a better explanation.  This restaurant has great potential with some aggressive chefs in their kitchen."}
{"text":"AMAZING view, yummy food, great food and friendly service. Can't go wrong with this one!  We have visited Pittsburgh from Oregon  the last three years to watch a Steelers game and this was our second time in. This time we met Joe- he was really cool (I think he is a manager), he was very friendly and wanted to make sure we were having a good time and enjoying ourselves. I liked it!"}
{"text":"Had dinner last night with folks from out of town. Besides the spectacular view, the food was outstanding; the staff and service were very friendly and attentive; and we didn't feel rushed.  It was a great evening and  Vue-412 over delivered in every way. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"The views from Vue 412 are spectacular and every table on all three levels has a view!      While visiting family for Christmas from the Washington DC area, we wanted to experience dinner in Pittsburgh and enjoy the city views from Mt. Washington. We were not disappointed and got some great pictures. The wait staff were attentive, and even took some great shots for us! Dana our waitress was great. A few things were a little \"off\" however!       We had a party of 9, but a small plate of bread with maybe 5 small pieces  was brought out. They said more world come out in a little whine since it was still warming in the oven.. 10 minutes later we received 2 more small plates. The white table cloths were covered with brown paper! I felt like I was eating at a crab house  back on Maryland!! The calamari and bada  bing shrimp were fantastic, but the meatballs with ricotta , which took longer to come to the table were cold!  The Chicken Romano and Lobster mac and cheese were great, as well as the chicken with artichokes and capers and the cod fish special , but the gnocchi  dish was mushy and filled with too much garlic. My  nephew could not even eat it! My mother ordered the Prime Rib which was served grilled and dry with no au jus which I thought was strange. The baked potatoes were served cold. They were happy to warm them but when they brought them back they were still cold. One other thing, the meals did not come out at the same time, so we all had to wait politely until all of the meals were served.    They took the Prime Rib off of our bill and offered two complimentary desserts to make up for the cold potatoes which was a nice gesture.  All in all we enjoyed our family meal together, but would probably try some place different next time we dine on Mt. Washington!!"}
{"text":"The view is great if you are ever in Pittsburgh! It's on top of the mountain so you can see right into the Steelers stadium. The food is expensive though but it's probably because of the location. You have to pay to park to which kinda sucks."}
{"text":"First time here. Went for restaurant week. We had incredible dinners and service was excellent as well. We will def come back.  The portions for restaurant week were large compared to other restaurants and the food was cooked to perfection. Thank you for a great night out with the family"}
{"text":"Of course the vue is fantastic!  Our server was super friendly, maybe to much so.  Forgot to tell us the special until we asked after we ordered.  Order a bottle of wine, after 15 minutes asked our waitress about our wine.  The bartender was busy with 10 ladies at the bar, we were told.  Well why not get the manager to get our bottle requested?  When the wine came server poured way to much in our glasses.  Obviously server training needed. Started with the Bada Bing Shrimp,  a spicy sauce was OK but not anything special.  I had the Osso Bucco.... Very good! Waited for our salads, which are huge, wondering why other tables had bread & oil with sun dried tomato & tapenade but we did not.  Well it did come with the salad but others received it with app.  Not sure when it should have come but servers are not consistent or others requested it early. With our salad was OK by me. Did I mention the Osso Bucco was really good!  Had a bite of salmon & it was good too.   We had a nice diner with a great view.  Probably a 3.5 diner due to my Osso Bucco!"}
{"text":"Steve the bartender and Olivia were very nice and hospitality was amazing. Would come back anytime!!"}
{"text":"music too loud and too young.( based on summer visit, not date of posting).  I did not feel comfortable as I did when it was Tin Angel.  Wondered if this was a college party. Food and service are good though.  prices decent. Spiff up your ambiance is my advice.  I will be back regardless.  ps I have returned twice since then in a just pay half deal.  They must have read my review since the Ambiance is much better"}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate a special occasion last week. We ordered three items off the menu and got a complimentary spicy shrimp appetizer. The shrimp was great and the mussels were fine (although the sausage I found to be on the dry side). The lobster mac n cheese came in a huge portion with a fair amount of lobster. However, after 10 bites, I no longer felt the desire to continue eating. It's one of those dishes where it's good for the first few bites, but then gets tiring to eat. The Osso Bucco Chardonnay (\"French inspired pork shank braised in rosemary demi\") was well prepared and we would recommend it. Our server was very kind and attentive. The view at Vue 412 is great, but just as good as any other restaurant on Grandview Ave. The seats by the window seemed limited though, at least on the top floor. Since boyfriend and I came on a weeknight (Thursday), the top level was all empty except for the two of us by around 9:15pm, which made it extra romantic!  Taste | 4 Atmosphere | 3.5 Presentation | 3 Service | 4 OVERALL | 4"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible experience at this restaurant. My boyfriend and I are from out of town and came here for our anniversary dinner. We had to wait over 30 minutes even though we had a reservation. When we were finally seated we had to wait even longer for service. The waitress took a long time to bring drinks and we wait even longer for our orders to be taken. The service at this restaurant is terrible and the food was not good either. A complete waste of money and time, I wish I could give zero stars. We will never come back to this restaurant and recommend that others avoid this place as well. The manager was also no help at all and the waitress had a very bad attitude after they messed up the food on our order."}
{"text":"Awesome food great view and best service I ever had chief came out an had a relationship with the customers and checked up on us through the meal to see if everything was to our liking"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! The manager Joe was fabulous and very accommodating to our two little children. We had the Vue burger and Chopped salad, delicious! The view is beautiful too!"}
{"text":"I could write a book about how terrible everything was, from service/atmosphere/food. Manager must know this and was clearly overcompensating hovering over us the whole night. Interrupting our conversation to awkwardly give a speech about how if we're not used to fine dining we wont understand why our meals were about to take a long time? So bizarre. My friends were just too to polite to cause a scene and we were there trying to celebrate a birthday, not spend the whole time complaining. Food took FOREVER and was terrible. Must be all that fine dining I dont know about? Oh wait, I've worked in fine service for ten years. Our water and drinks were empty all night. Ambience was non-existent. The only thing they couldn't screw up was the view. I would give zero stars if I could."}
{"text":"We went here for the view, and that was wonderful. When we arrived, they said the kitchen was backed up 15 minutes, and we agreed. The server said she had never seen the lunch menu before, and there was no children's menu. 45 minutes after we ordered, we were informed they were out of the flatbread I ordered, and I ordered a grilled cheese.    While we waited, our drinks were not refilled. Two of the plates arrived in about 10 minutes more, and they were not what was ordered. My grandsons and my grilled cheese arrived in another 10 minutes, and were actually some cheese heated on a roll, and not grilled.   The view was awesome, and the menu had great potential, but the service was very poor. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Being a native now living out of state, I was heartbroken when I heard The Tin Angel had closed, but upon a visit to Mount Washington, we discovered the place that is now there is a great replacement!  Even though we couldn't get seats upon calling ahead, we took a ride up the incline and while walking around the new owner invited us to the bar.  Great updates! Great new menu and libation offerings!  Extremely friendly and hospitable!  So Happy to have experienced it and will be back the next time we are in the Burg!  You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The Service was very attentive but not as knowledgeable as I expected for this level of restaurant. I had a couple fairly simple questions about the menu (which was excellent), nothing strange, just straightforward questions about preparation and they were met with indecisiveness and an offer to check with the kitchen. No big deal but at a place like this, you need to be able to describe the \"surf\" in the surf and turf when it isn't listed. I was told it was a white fish of some kind. Salmon is not a white fish. Again, it was good anyway but I could see some being pretty put off by that if you don't like salmon.  The entire main course was 3.5. There was nothing glaringly wrong, but the overall presentation and taste is not what I'd associate with a $45 price point. The drinks (pear martini and pomegranate Moscow mule) were 5 stars, hands down. Finished with a chocolate creme du pot or something. It was a solid 4 stars. In fairness, this place is a solid 3.5 stars with the view, but there is room to step it up. My suggestion would be to lower the prices 20-25% and reduce the menu to accommodate that. I'd be a frequent customer but I can't completely justify the value at this point with better options within walking distance."}
{"text":"I had been here before for a Sunday lunch with a friend visiting from out of town then today with a Groupon and another friend.  We we're not disappointed at all.  The mgr introduced himself to us and chatted, the waiter was very nice and attentive as well.  The food was excellent.  I had 2 appetizers, greens and beans, excellent! And eggplant rolletini, also very good.  My friend had the cod sandwich and fries.  I wish we had room for dessert, but didn't.  All in all, it was a treat to go here today!"}
{"text":"Our family went for lunch to celebrate our mom's birthday and had a great time. The food and service was excellent. The lobster Mac and cheese was amazing and the tiramisu for dessert was delicious. Great view and very friendly atmosphere."}

No valet parking, though the host greets you outside the restaurant, making you think he's in charge of the valet parking and is the first indication of just how small the restaurant space really is. We sat by the window, great view but don't come for the view, come for the service & food. Our waitress (Jennifer) was very friendly and attentive and went over all the house specials and answered all our questions. An odd point, after April 1st, they don't offer soup on the menu.  My wife had the house salad, excellent and the house dressing was outstanding. I had the chopped salad. A little different, the lettuce was not chopped, the chopped ingredients rested on a bed of spring mix lettuce, but very tasty. We had to wait for the fresh bread to come out of the oven, it was nothing special. I ordered the Osso Busso. I had read reviews on Yelp, all positive, all true. I've heard of other variations, veal, over polenta, for example. This was pork over mashed potatoes w/green beans. I have never had it before so I don't have anything to compare it to, but the pork was tender, and very flavorful. Yum! My wife often orders the crab cakes when she is out. She did again. She received two good sized cakes w/asparagus. Her revue is simple. They were the best she has ever had, period. She could only finish one of the two. We shared the death by chocolate dessert. If you have to die, this is the way to go! At the end of it all, only two comments: we most definitely will return and would order the same meals again but based upon the experience we are anxious to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Awful...awful..awful. Can I make it a negative rating?  8 of us went for dinner. Had reservations since September. Waited at least 1/2 hour before ordering. Drinks came. Another 30 - 45 minutes then they brought a mixture of salads and entrees together. Complained and they said there was a mix up. Complained to the manager and he said \"What do you want me to do?\" Really? How about catering to your customers. After waiting another 20 minutes with no one coming by to see what we wanted, where the rest of our meals and drinks where, we decided to just leave. Found the manager on the way out to tell him we were leaving. He said the meals were comp' d. Duh. Never did he offer us any incentive to come back. That's okay. We won't. Many other choices to go to than to waste your time here. Stay away."}
{"text":"We are visiting from Philadelphia, and were looking for an afforable place to eat on Mt. Washington. My husband found this restaurant online, so we gave it a try.  It did not disappoint!  The food was delicious, the view was spectacular, and the wait staff was extremely friendly and efficient.  The manager even introduced himself to us, and was also very friendly and helpful.  This restaurant is a real gem!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great people. 5 stars All day!  Suggest the Lobster MAC.   We were just visiting the area on our way home and stopped for lunch.  Glad we did.  Prices are reasonable as well.  And the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"412 Vue may be premier value on the Mount. The view is spectacular as expected. The service is outstanding (Dan). The food is excellent, osso buco,gnocchi and tortellaci. The owner/ manager very solicitous. The prices much more reasonable than many neighboring establishments. The only drawback is out off their control- a $10 parking lot across Grandview Ave."}
{"text":"Amazing service. Amazing food  Anything from burgers to seafood   Will go back frequently"}
{"text":"Hello All Great choice for a tasty PITTSBURGH dinner.   Food was outstanding. Restaurant week menu was quite spectacular.   Drinks were served promptly and made well   Joe got us in with a late reservation.    Nathan took care of us. Liz helped as well  Lester makes a mean Manhattan."}
{"text":"There's a lot of potential being a restaurant on Mt. Washington, but it's another one on the mountain that doesn't focus enough on quality.  My wife and I came here for a Valentine's Day reservation like many other couples for the view and were very excited to try a new restaurant. In the end the food turned out fine, but to say the service was slow was an understatement. Since it was a holiday, we expected it to be busy, but it took 20-30 min to get a seat even though we had reservations. After getting to the table, it took the server another 30 min to get me another drink. The entree took another 45 min and we saw 2 tables that joked about sharing sticks of gum because their food was taking so long. The server was just absent.  Maybe we will try again, but it doesn't seem worth the price/time for your standard American fare."}
{"text":"BAD! There was a large group of us, and we were expecting a better experience. Service was SLOW! There were no dishes in our group that were cooked correctly. Duck was DRY! Scallops were undercooked! Sealks were not cooked the way people requested. Manager was going to come speak to us, and never came out. Highly disappointed, will not return!"}
{"text":"This is the best place for food and view in  Pittsburgh. Reasonable in price salad exceptional"}
{"text":"My mom wanted to dine at a restaurant with a nice view for dinner so we made reservations at Vue 412.  The experience already started off badly when we arrived and were told that we had no reservations. Even when I showed them the confirmation e-mail the employee just sounded confused and tried to book me for the next available table. We had also requested seating by the window, but were told that none were available unless we would be able to finish in 45 minutes which is ridiculous. And then an hour into our meal, I receive a call from the restaurant asking if I'm going to be arriving for my reservation. Definitely left a bad taste in my mouth.  On to the food:  Complimentary Bread (5/5): served with a delicious olive and tomato tapenade.  Mussels (4/5): these were really good and the best thing we had all night.  Steak Salad (2/5): my mom found the lettuce not very fresh and her steak wasn't seasoned well.  Osso Bucco (3/5): the pork was very soft and fell off the bone, but everything was just very salty.  Veal Piccatta (2/5): the lemon sauce was very diluted and everything just tasted under-seasoned.  Overall the view was great, but not so much for the customer service and food. We also noticed that all the Caucasian customers were seated by the windows, while my party, another Asian party, and an African American party were seated in the upper area. Would not recommend dining here."}
{"text":"Great for lunch and family outings. Italian cuisine, great service and the view is breathtaking"}
{"text":"This place was awesome.. Great. Friendly people... Joe was awesome. Thanks!.. The beer is good. And the crab cake was on point.."}
{"text":"Just stopped by randomly on an evening walk but immediately loved the view, homemade cocktails (thanks Adam) and delicious - fresh - food.  It's a new place in Mount Washington but a great change of pace from some of the other spots up here."}
{"text":"I've been here twice--the first time I went was a great experience.  We had amazing seats for dinner right against the window during the sunset.  The view was amazing, and the wine and food (salmon) was excellent.    Fast forward to a month later, and based on my first experience, I suggested Vue 412 for my dad's birthday, since my family wanted to go somewhere a little more upscale.  They did a great job accommodating a party of 12, with a few younger children, and the view was again great.  However, that's where the positives stopped.  When we sat down, the menu was not what I remembered.  The first time I went, the menu was a one pager with 10 or so entree options.  This time, the menu was totally different--it was a dozen pages.  I was just disappointed that it seemed like the restaurant went from being more on the upscale side to a much more casual concept.  I got the filet and it was below average.  A few family members said their food was very much over salted.  However, we still paid for the meals as if the place was more upscale.  I guess as an earlier reviewer stated, you are simply paying for the view.  I also thought the service was a big downgrade the second time around.  We had two servers, based on the party of 12, and they had to come back 3 separate times to ask myself and other members of my family what we ordered or how we wanted our steaks done.  I understand if that happens with one person, but I'm not sure how they totally missed 3 out of 12 orders.    Long story short, raved about this place after my first visit, but probably won't be going back now that I know it is not the same formal concept I remember it being--plenty of other options in Mt. Washington with a view."}
{"text":"My husband had the restaurant week menu-superb risotto and Chilean sea bass with grilled romaine and I had the veal piccata with artichokes, capers and very tender veal with mashed potatoes. The food, view and service was fantastic. My only negative was the awful music blaring in the background-it was thump thump thump of the bass to songs like Katy Perry's \"Eye of the Tiger\" which really destroys the ambience of fine dining. They should just turn it off because the incredible view and delicious food certainly provide enough ambience."}
{"text":"I was really so excited to dine here tonight. Coleen assured me we would be well taken care of, (laughs) Well let me start by saying I had made these reservations three days in advance. I have nothing against a sports bar with a view, but don't act like I need reservations and tell me I'll be well taken care of just to seat me in what feels to be a man cave with a view. I'm sorry, a vue.There are only a few tables on the lower level. We were unfortunately pushed up against a party of 12 wildly loud elderly folk. Our entire table was unable to talk to one another because every ten seconds someone in the party would start screaming irrelevant statements. To make matters worse (Although I'm sure you don't believe me at this point)  My girlfriend found tinfoil in her salad. we actually just chose to leave. Wonderful for mix drinks and a view but not much else. Just keep that in mind. Yelp on."}
{"text":"First off, PRIME LOCATION with a great view but needs a facelift as the ambiance leaves a lot to be desired.  We went Sunday at noon, it was not particularly busy, however we had to wait a long time for a veggie burger and a salad. I had wanted to drink a glass of rose but they were out and one of the breakfast dishes was also sold out so the veggie burger was my second choice. Well the patty was burned and the avocados were missing altogether.  I will say the server (Alicia) was very nice but I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"Overall I really enjoyed Vue 412. The view is obviously great but we also enjoyed the food and the cocktails. I like that there are options for a less expensive casual meal or for an expensive night out. I also love that they put a recommended drink pairing next to the menu items.   We started the meal off with a crab and corn dip that I thought was delicious. For my meal I ordered the chicken tacos which I enjoyed. I also tasted the chicken flatbread which was awesome and the garlic fettuccini that was very rich but delicious.   The only downside with the food was I ordered the mixed green salad as an appetizer and it just came out a bed of spinach and didn't have the toppings described in the menu. The others ordered wedge salad which they said was great.  Another issue was we ordered dessert to go (death by chocolate, coconut cream pie, and cheesecake). The cheesecake was very good but the others must have been incorrect because the coconut cream pie was a cake and had no coconut and the death by chocolate was also a vanilla cake) Not sure if the waiter possibly put it in wrong but we didn't realize until we got home.   I went in the first couple weeks of the opening so I will definitely try it again."}
{"text":"I first came across Vue 412 when searching for a venue on top of Mount Washington for a graduation party for my sister. The banquet menus and pricing were easily accessible online which gave me all the information I was looking for. I called the restaurant and was easily able to reserve a room for my party and also pick the menu. As soon as we arrived we were greeted by the manager and a welcoming staff. The staff was attentive and very personable. Aside from the fantastic service, the food was unbelievable and a great value for the price. At the end of the party, our waiter, Pat, after already doing a great job, packaged up all of our leftover food to take home. Will definitely be recommending Vue 412 to others as well as will be returning back myself. They were able to make what could have been a very stressful experience, relaxing and memorable. Definitely stop in!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I dined here for dinner on New Year's Eve. I made the reservation over a month in advance and requested a table against the window since this is on Mt. Washington and overlooks the city. Unfortunately, my request was not honored even though there was an open table by the window when we arrived and for over an hour after we ordered. A couple who walked in and sat at the bar ended up getting it later. We were seated right next to the bar and by the back of the house/dishwasher so it was pretty noisy.   I also checked on their website several times leading up to New Years to see whether there was any special event or tasting menu offered and there was nothing mentioned. However, a prix fixe menu was given to us along with the regular menu when we were seated. It was not explained to us that the prix fixe was the ONLY option until I tried to order something from the regular menu. Not a big deal, but I think it should have been mentioned on the website or when we made the reservation a month prior.   The food was pretty good and portions were fairly generous. The view is obviously the highlight. I would probably go back and order off the regular menu and insist on sitting upstairs in the main dining area."}
{"text":"Tonight was fancy date night for J and I, so we picked Vue 412 since we've heard positive reviews. Man...were we wrong. First the good things: the view at Vue was great. And, that's about it. Everything else was mediocre to downright awful. Our waitress Lorraine from the UK was terrible. Initially, we took pity on her thinking that she was new and forgetful, however we later found out (from the manager) that she's \"ditzy\". We ordered the charcuterie to start. Unimpressive. The bread was hard...not crispy...hard. One of the meats had a peppermint aftertaste, which made J sick. I ordered a glass of Riesling and was told that I couldn't have that because it was not placed in the fridge like all of the other wines. Huh?!?! I got a Moscato instead. J asked for anything non-alcoholic and was told that they could give him sparkling water, but that was it. What?!?! No sodas?? Then came our entrees. J ordered the fettuccini broccoli and chicken Alfredo, and I ordered the salmon. My salmon came with asparagus, rather than spinach as the menu said, and I did not have fig and Gorgonzola cheese pasta as promised. J's Alfredo pasta was TERRIBLE.  The sauce was oily and running everywhere, not creamy as one would think. Instead of fettuccini noddles, he was given meat filled ravioli, the chicken was dry and burnt, and the entire dish tasted bland. When we expressed our displeasure with Lorraine, she responded \"I don't know what the chef is doing up there. Maybe he's sleeping. Or maybe he's high. I don't know\" What?!?! You should NEVER say that. Since J didn't touch his food, we asked for it to be taken off the bill. Lorraine told us that since he had a little bit, they were not going to do that. We asked who she spoke with and she said that there was no manager present. During dinner?!?! So we asked for the check, paid $100 and got up to leave. The hostess asked how our meal was, and when we told of our experience, she immediately rolled her eyes, said \"Oh Lorraine\" and went to get a manager. We spoke with the manager and he refunded J's meal. Needless to say, we are never going back there again."}
{"text":"Great place! My fiance came very close to closing, but the staff was perfectly friendly and did not rush us at all. We had salad, filet mignon entrees, wine, and dessert - everything was on point!  Our table overlooked the city and I enjoyed the nice, but not stuffy,ambiance. Our waitress was such a sweetheart! We were visiting the city, so she told us some little known facts and other restaurants to try. I literally wanted to move to Pittsburgh after speaking with her. This was a highlight of our trip- Definitely try it out!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant and amazing staff. Not over priced for what you get. Worth every penny. I wish I would've gone during the sunset because it is hard to get a good picture with the reflection from all the light outside."}
{"text":"The view is the reason to come here.  That cannot be beat-- and for the price of the food, it really is about the view."}
