{"text":"Good friendly service, have only been here for half price wings on Wednesdays. Dusted chicken wings are really good and have a variety of sauces to choose."}
{"text":"My friend and I had a hankering for pub food. Where to go? Looking for a new place to try, we came to Pearson Pub. This place has plenty of seating and a very large bar with TVs all over. They have daily food specials, live music and karaoke. It had your typical pub vibe, dark wooden furniture and walls, worn carpet, regulars perched at the bar; the usual. It was a lot bigger than I expected.(That's what she said, ya ya) 

I went with the Fish & Chips and my friend got Wings with Sweet Chili sauce. The fish and chips came with 2 decent pieces of Haddock, coleslaw, tartar sauce and fries. There was a little more batter than I like, but it was still good. The coleslaw and fries were perfect; plentiful and crunchy! She said the wings were good, a little kick, but not much. To me, it would've been hot as she is a spicy gal! 

It wasn't until we were done eating that we noticed people coming back to the table with bowls of something. Turns out, there's complimentary soup in the corner by the fireplace, so keep an eye out for it when you're there. 

Service was ok. We waited 15min or so before we were served. A little pet peeve of mine is when tables seated after me get served first. The drink menu is all of the usual suspects, but sadly no craft beer. Everything there was extremely OK - not better, not worse, just really OK."}
{"text":"Everything here is ALWAYS good!  The wings, the pizza, poutine and even the free soup. I highly recommend everything and the price isn't bad either. Good service, friendly staff."}
{"text":"I came for open mic night and got to try the fries (which I must say were like some mutant breed of delicious crispy crunchy exterior surrounding a moist potato inside). The rest of the food smelled good too. Good people and good atmosphere. Nice big location with lots of parking in the area and close to transit and taxis too."}
{"text":"When in Whitby this place has got to be among my top five favourites for wings.

I have not had the chance, since just arriving back in Durham to try their whole menu, however as a wing guy I was impressed, the variety of sauces and the variation of heat level was above average for local pubs.

Daily free soup and great weekly specials will make this a regular stop for me. Live entertainment, friendly service and great food,makes this one of my Durham favs."}
