Tai tai means wife or a formal way of addressing a married woman. Tai tai box I presume means lunch boxes that a tai tai prepares. Trying to go for that homey feels.

This small restaurant is the perfect place to grab a snack after my facial. Especially since I miss having kaya toast from Singapore! We ordered the kaya French toast with cheese and a cold milk tea, which were delicious! Definitely satisfied my crazy craving, and will be back for more kaya in the future. Staff were very courteous, attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Located in the plaza at Midland and Micnicoll, Tai Tai is a take out joint that is easy to miss if you're not really looking for it. This is kind of a shame in my opinion since they offer great deals for fresh oysters (ex. $5 for 6 Raspberry Point) and fresh seafood in general like a large slab of raw salmon, and octopus tentacles!! I went in to look around, and the lady working there was really nice and suggested the sashimi bento box which the chef has just prepared (there are items that are already made, but you can also order items to be made for you). So for 8.99, I get a pretty big sashimi bento (which include sweet shrimp, tuna, white tuna, salmon, octopus and saba sashimi, rice, clam salad, and pickled radishes) which also comes with a miso soup and garden salad. The bento was fantastic (especially for the price) and the sashimi were sooo fresh and delicious with the highlight being the salmon sashimi. Will definitely return to try some of their other cooked items!!

Only caveat is, the lady's english isn't the best (ok for me since I speak chinese), BUT if you're just going to order and leave it should be ok. Just don't attempt lengthy english conversation.

PS. Free green tea when waiting for your food! They also sell random japanese goodies (kind  of like a convenience store) like ramune and japanese mayo!"}
{"text":"My colleague found this new snack spot which has a great selection of rice boxes, noodles, fried chicken, French toast and sandwiches. Prices are reasonable and food is tasty. I had both the Egg and Luncheon meat sandwich and the HK style milk tea (which was Soo good even without any sugar) for $3.99. For dessert, I had a sesame and coconut toast for $2.69. I am pretty full now and can probably skip dinner. Definitely would like to try one of their rice boxes next time like the Teriyaki eel or the Korean style beef! Yum! From the prices I see on their take out menu, nothing seems to be over $5.99. I think they close early as in 6pm, so hurry and try it out during the day. :)"}
{"text":"DISGUSTING FOOD HANDLING! AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!

Went in there one day with my sister, since we were both craving sushi and it was the closest place to our house. The place looked fairly clean on the inside. It took a little bit to order due to language barriers. Understandable, not everybody can speak proper english. No problem. 

Anyways, after we had finally ordered, I requested that all fish be kept separate from my meal as I'm a strict vegetarian. Separate utensils, clean surface, etc. Not too much to ask for, right? Well, the guy shook his head 'yes' and proceeded to wipe down the dirty counter with a wet towel, after which was used to wipe his hands!!! Gross. I asked him to please wash his hands and use a clean towel to dry. \"Okay\", he said. Seconds later, he wiped down the counter again, rinsed his hands and dried with that towel. Being hungry, I finally said whatever to myself and continued to watch. With that SAME towel, he wiped down the lettuce for my rolls. I was getting quite annoyed at this point and asked for clean lettuce, not wiped down with a towel used for the counter and his hands (mind you, he didn't even use soap for his hands.) What happened next? He did the SAME THING AGAIN. WITH THE SAME TOWEL. I got so fed up, I asked for a refund and told them to cancel the order. They didn't even give me a full refund because of some technicality that they couldn't even properly explain in english (AKA it was BS and they were being cheap.) 

I would NEVER go back there if anybody paid me to. Worst service and especially terrible food handling.

Avoid it, at least for the sake of your health."}
{"text":"I doubt I will ever has a Tai Tai (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai_tai) to prepare any bento box for me as lunch. However, Tai Tai Box maybe the closest thing I would experienced!

Tai Tai Box ($8.99) was made when ordered: the deep fried items (Gillette Shrimps and Takoyaki) were all fresh and not oily at all! Side Salad and Miso Soup on the side.

Good as a take out or if you prefer to eat in, there is a little counter with 4 bar stools for your dine in pleasure.

Staff is so friendly and cheerful and even ask me to have a cup of green tea while I wait for me food.

I will be back! They even serves fresh shucked oysters (40 cents each extra for labour) or you can just buy them to shuck at home!"}
{"text":"Tried the Kaya French Toast with cheese which was better than I expected. Also tried the fish siu mai which was decent quality. I was a little disappointed they don't do seafood anymore but at least they have a variety of snacks and hot meals. The young lady working there was very polite and friendly. 3.5 stars for overall value and quality of food. I would go back to try their chicken wings and skewers."}
