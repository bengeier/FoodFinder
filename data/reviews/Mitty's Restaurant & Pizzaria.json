{"text":"I enjoyed this place the first two times I've been there.  Toppings are fresh, pizza is cooked just right, good cheese, crust just the way I like it.  

I think there was another pizza place here a few years ago.  I can't recall the name in any case.  Mittys seems to have remodeled the restaurant and it really has a nice professional appearance.  

I plan on making a third visit here soon!"}
{"text":"Been going for at least four years. Never disappointed! Get the thin deluxe pizza. The wait staff is outstanding no matter how busy they are.  Will keep going. Usually have 4-8 in our party all times.  In a nutshell, you never tried, you are missing out on a Finleyville secret!!!!"}
{"text":"I eat out 14 times a week, all over the U.S. I think it's time to start giving honest feedback; helping others make informed dining decisions. 

This was takeout:

+Pizza was very good. Quality cheese. 
+Pasta cooked perfectly. Great sauce. 
+Large portions
+Clean, very casual environment. 
+Friendly staff
-Does not accept American Express! Frustrating. We won't be back until they start accepting, as this is our only payment form. This is 2015, come on. 

Overall Grade: 75% out of 100% 
I would not recommend this restaurant, as ownership must be absent since 1982."}
{"text":"The closest to Jersey style pizza in Pittsburgh. Outstanding service. They'll give you a complimentary beverage while waiting for take-out."}
{"text":"I've been to Mitty's twice so far and have loved it both times. We kind of stumbled upon it by accident went we were going home through Finleyville and I'm super happy we did! The food is absolutely delicious and extremely inexpensive. The service is wonderful. I recommend the loaded steak hoagie. Everything on it is fresh and the steak is super tender and delicious."}
{"text":"Slow service, I don't blame the server, she was very nice, but the only one waiting on customers. Hamburger was too salty for me. Homemade chips were good! Worst part was my boyfriend was served coffee in a cup with lipstick all over it. Yuck! Won't go back."}
{"text":"Our favorite local eatery,we come about twice a month on tuesdays for their family pizza night. The price cant be beat,the salads are huge,and even drinks are included. The pizza is always excellent. Waitstaff is
 friendly. We sometimes have a short wait for a seat,but we dont mind."}
{"text":"Written here before, but couldn't help myself. Food came tonight and was wonderful. Couldn't ask for better quality. My favorite place to order."}
{"text":"Great place for pizza or wings do yourself a favor and skip breakfast frozen bagels reheated bacon over cooked eggs ."}
{"text":"This place is hidden gem! Thank goodness we spotted this on our way home one night. We wanted to stop somewhere for a quick meal as it was getting late and received quite a surprise, really quality food and service at incredibly reasonable prices. Service was great. We were greeted and seated right away, drinks never dipped below half full. The menu was just right. It of course had the traditional pizza shop options, but there were lots of surprises mixed in. The pizza burgers were too tempting to pass up, so obviously we both ordered them. And the rest was history. We were stunned when they came out. I thought, \"this looks Burgatory level\". And let me tell you, by the time I finished the last bite I was convinced that thought was now truth. If my phone wasn't dead at the time, I absolutely would have captured that moment. I guess that's just a good excuse to go back... not that I need one!"}
{"text":"Nearly the worst pizza experience I've had since dining in my elementary school cafeteria. The pizza was extremely soggy, presumably from the canned mushrooms they did not drain properly before throwing them on the pie. Based on the previous reviews, I expected fresh, quality ingredients but nothing on our pizza really fit that description. One really cool thing about Mitty's is that they make and market their own hot sauces, but it's not that cool - the \"hot\" was very very hot but one-dimensional in flavor (just hot; boring). I will say that the non-pizza foods we saw being delivered around us *looked* pretty good, especially the mac and cheese. It was also seemingly clean and our server was nice!"}
{"text":"I always love their food and the service is always really good too. I love the loaded mac and cheese and they have a kale ravioli that is good too. But one thing has me always considering this place to be top notch.

Once I went in to eat. After I got my food I heard the staff talking about the server for their credit card system had just gone down. It didn't come back up before I was ready to leave and as it went out after I ordered and didn't have cash they just told me I could come back another day and pay for it then. Well, I stopped back in 2 days later, which was a Monday, but they are closed on Mondays. OK, THAT wasn't really great at all, in fact I think it is pretty dumb but after the end of this I don't care about it.  So I went back again later when I was nearby trying to help my sister figure out why her Comcast was out. Well, Comcast was out all throughout the Uniontown and Finleyville area so again they were unable to take my payment for my meal. Finally, the next time I went by was a couple of weeks later and this time all systems were go. Since it was a while back the manager came over. He was so glad I came back after 3 total attempts to pay before that he gave ma a 25% discount off of that original meal. Now THAT was awesome."}
{"text":"This place is a great family restaurant and had a great variety of food.  We ordered the triple pepperoni pizza.  It was really good.  Also had their wings and it had the the right amount of spice.  Our server was really accommodating and had a great personality.
The place was remodeled and has plenty of room.  They do not serve alcohol, but they do allow BYOB with corking fee.  They have family pizza night on Tuesdays as well.  They ran out of the large cupcakes that looked amazing so didn't get to try those."}
{"text":"Just tried this pizza yesterday and boy, is it a new found favorite! I cannot wait to have friends and family experience this place! The pizza is inexpensive. $10.99 for a large cut pizza. The slices are small but full of gourmet flavor! The crust is very thin, but not like a cracker, more like a crusty, rising flat bread. (It's really hard to explain!!! It's just that good!) The cheese is really good, and there isn't much sauce. Out of all of the pizza places around, this place is truly unique and full of flavor! The inside is smaller if it is busy and can be very loud and hectic when busy (There was a school there when I went). Once the crowd died down, it was much more relaxing and comfortable. The staff was nice, friendly, and talkative. I cannot wait to go here again and bring everyone I know!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza has some basic components. Two pies ordered with some zucchini \"logs\". 41 bucks. The service was good and the folks are friendly and that's the positive. Next to no sauce on a soggy mess for both pies. The Hawaiian had few toppings (11 chunks of pineapple on a medium) and next to no ham. The deluxe was fine with toppings but had to be eaten with a fork as it was a soggy mess. Attempting to lift a slice resulted in a flaccid chunk of dough with the toppings sliding off. Take some time and put some sauce on the pies and cook them. The zucchini contained 3  pieces."}
{"text":"We decided to eat here because it's about 4 minutes from our house. It took 35 minutes to get our food at 4:30 on a Thursday. The waitress never came over to explain why it was taking so long. I ordered a steak hoagie that was prepared wrong. The tiny amount of meat they put on the hoagie is shameful. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Great food, great customer service! We didn't care for the steak sandwich so asked to order a pizza instead. Waitress was so friendly and didn't even question the switch! I had the fried chicken salad which was delicious and a lot to eat. The personal pizzas are a little small for someone who is really hungry. Overall though good, cheap food and a great wait staff!"}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time here and it was very good. I ordered the Black and Blue burger it was great, Messy but great!"}
{"text":"Dam I really wanted to like this place, I drive past it every day after work and decided to finally try it... Very disappointed. Yes all the ingredients are great but whoever made the pizza probably should make pizzas ever again... Unless this is how they serve them... I got a medium cheese pizza just to test them out, The dough was paper like... Seriously... The cheese is really good the sauce is good detail was good it just wasn't put together very well.. I will give them another try but as my first impression very poor"}
