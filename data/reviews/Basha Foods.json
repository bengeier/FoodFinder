{"text":"Basha foods has something for everyone. The place is huge, they stock all kinds of middle eastern goodies. You won't find everything you are looking for but I go there whenever I am in the North East. They can do better with their produce section, prices were better and the quality was a bit higher a year ago. There was an earwig in an apple we bought from there. The apples were delicious It could have happened anywhere but I wish they pay more attention to their produce section."}
{"text":"Basha Foods is a Middle Eastern supermarket in the northeast.  The expansive market houses a large bakery with tons of pita bread, an abundance of fresh produce, and an impressive meat counter that takes up the whole back of the store. They offer a wealth of meat choices including lamb and goat. There's also an olive and pickle bar, as well as aisle upon aisle of International dried and canned goods.  The spice trade is alive and well at Basha Foods, with an entire aisle dedicated to International seasonings. I picked up some peanut laddu, which is the Indian equivalent of peanut brittle shaped into a very hard ball. The cashier joked about the laddu's potential to damage my teeth. She was fun, as was the whole shopping experience at Basha Foods."}
{"text":"t's so sad, I really wanted to be a customer since I belong to the same culture! Firstly, all vegetable isn't fresh, and meat in the display turning black and their expiry date is reached. . I bought some Lebanese desert which is basically made of cheese and cream, my wife and I tried at home, and in 3-4 hours got sick and started throwing up! When we checked the expiry date it's the day of purchase. When you put people's life at risk, it's dangerous, health authority should take note and action to close the food section or even the entire store. I am a doctor, I 'll do my best to take this to the next level.  Secondly, there is no existence of customer service in this store.  I strongly don't recommend anyone to go shopping there.. That was my first and last horrible experience at Basha food international!"}
{"text":"While many middle eastern and south Asian dry good staples are available cheaper and fresher at Superstore these days, there are still a few reasons to visit Basha. The first is hard to find produce like Jerusalem artichokes, fresh almond fruit and fava beans in their pods. The second is the unusual frozen food selection like green chick peas, savory mezze pastries, and sliced coconut. Finally, it's one of only a few places you'll find more obscure dry goods like teff flour in bulk, red quinoa and sumac seasoning. If you're sick of tikka masala they have a whole row of spice mixes from around the world. Also a bonus, they are open on Canadian holidays like Christmas and Easter when other large grocery store are closed."}
{"text":"Far from where I live, but allows me to buy the few things I can't get at superstore. Cheap spices, good produce and international foods are a few things. Their beef is awesome and so is their lamb. Usually everything is pretty good here. However normal groceries aren't very cheap here."}
{"text":"Love shopping in Basha, they carry everything from Middle-East to East Asia !!!"}
{"text":"If your into middle eastern foods this is your place.  They have everything from olives, pita bread, dates to exotic foods from India.  You can even buy shisha pipes but they appear to be cheap chinese models. You definately have to be from the middle east or be familiar with these kind of foods cause you won't even know what some of this stuff is. If your into turkish cotton candy don't buy it from here...its expensive and dried out! Other than that the prices seemed fair and the service was the same."}
{"text":"I am disappointed in two things here  1. I always buy meat and Chicken from Basha, but sometimes when I buy whole chicken, I ask the guy to cut it for me, once He said He can't cut it because nobody is working with him at that time, and once He said, I will cut it but it takes time because He is alone, then I took my business else where  2. Vegetable is always old and never fresh, aside to it's price being high.  I will give Basha one more chance, If the chicken thing happened again, I think I will just go to those small meat places . I am a customer who is spending money in that store, and I should get at least the minimum of service that I expect"}
{"text":"I am stuck between a 3 and a 4 for this place... I now see all the bad reviews on here and I did not have a bad experience at all. Shopping at Costco or Superstore threatens me with anxiety - I just want to get out of those places. I feel rushed and I dislike waiting in line for 40 minutes. This Basha store on the other hand was spacious, clean, no carts clogging any aisles, no lineups and I just felt like I could breathe! Shop and breathe! I had no idea it was here or even if it would be open on a holiday Monday but we were grabbing a coffee at the Tim's on the same lot and thought we would go in and check it out. Open until 930pm! I found it quite clean even though it was 'stocking shelves time' and there were some boxes here and there on the floor. The produce section is one of the things that won me over here - I like to cook International dishes and if you are looking for some things not normally found at most grocers', come and check this place out. Plantains, big juicy mangoes, Serrano peppers, yucca, garlic Naan bread and jarred spicy olives are among some things we bought. I did see some items close to expiry and some things that had had their lids pried off sitting on the shelves - that is the not so good. The owner did come up to us, introduced himself and seemed to take great pride in his store and his employees. He stated that the store used to be an Office Depot. Many of his goods are imported directly from Lebanon.  Sam gave us little samples in his bakery area and he advised that going in at 11am was the best time when everything comes out fresh (the REALLY good stuff sells out fast).  I was also impressed with the meat section. No fresh fish (some frozen) but everything else you could think of was there. Lamb heart, testicles, liver, tripe, tongue. Nice looking ground beef, some steak, samosas, etc, etc.  There is even a housewares aisle here in this store with some nifty little gadgets. In my opinion, this store is worth taking a look at especially to get some hard to find, interesting items. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I have been their customer for 5 years. Their 5% ROYALTY IS A SCAM. It isn't 5% of overall prices. It is overall 2% or 1%.   Meat here is fine but rest of the grocery is expensive. Also please note, and this is important.   As Muslim owners, they have taken advantage of fellow Muslims in the city. When it came to Ramadan, they jacked up their prices and infact medjool dates that we got cost $17 there. Same dates were for $8.99 in superstore. The owners should be ashamed of themselves of taking advantage of those Muslim customers who are coming there to shop, showing their support, but the owner is cranking up the price as they know dates are mostly bought during Ramadan. Why isn't superstore doing that."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service. Prices were great. Lots of unique stuff. Definitely will be going back on a regular basis. Found what I was looking for quickly."}
{"text":"I can say it is just a normal store where we can get east indian groceries too. Vegetables are nt cheaper, and indeed nt always fresh. And some products are nt upto their quality. For ex: I bought ginger garlic paste from this place and in a week the taste of it turned to sour and I had to stop using that. Even rice you get from here is nt of premium quality moreover they are high priced. The only cheapest items I found here were Wheat flour( atta ) and chicken. And as this place is far from public transit, I dont prefer this place.   We have much better and many good stores similar to it in NE like sanjha punjab or apna punjab, canadian super store which are a way better than this."}
{"text":"Shopping at Basha is easy and simple, I frequently shop here for all my spices, and teas, and a selection of meat. They offer a huge variety of spices, I mean huge! Being a Halal grocery, the meat is good, I get the thinly cut short beef ribs, and occasionally the already marinated kafta,(kabob minced beef w/spices). As for fruits and veggies, the prices are great, and very ethnic variety. From Indian, African, middle eastern, this place has it all. And last, the olive oil selection and prices are great. Do register on their website to become a member and save 5% off."}
{"text":"I admit the store suffers from lack of management and poor customer service, but on the other hand there are some delicious stuff that you can only find there. I've also bought meat and chicken from there, and they were good. Hopefully their business takes off and they tackle their problems, or they will take care of the problems so their business grows faster :)"}
{"text":"Basha has amazing prices and selection! It is heaven!!! The produce is way cheaper than at other supermarkets in Calgary (though sometimes it is best if used quickly as some things don't seem to stay good as long). The bakery is fabulous - check out the fresh ma'moul. Fantastic frozen selection including great Indian breads and hard-to-find frozen vegetables like purple yam and molokhiya. Wide selection of coffees, teas, spices, grains, juices... Highly recommend Basha!!"}
{"text":"I was eating in the area and couldn't pass up dropping in to this grocery store. It's great that most grocery stores now have ethnic aisles where I can, if I'm lucky, find the spice or sauce I'm interested in. If I want something that I can't find in a regular grocery store, I need to go to a small store in China Town, Indian Village, or Litty Italy, etc. Well, T&T expanded the ethnic Asian store to supermarket size and Basha does the same for the South Asian and Middle Eastern store.  Among other things, I really needed a bag of basmati rice and I was pleased to walk down the rice aisle and choose a bag. Not a great example, because choosing between different bags of rice isn't a big deal, but the selection for spices, sauces, and prepared foods was big.  I was disappointed with the produce section. I managed to find most of what I wanted, but some of the produce was bruised and I had to select very carefully.  I'd shop here regularly if I lived in the area."}
{"text":"I am saddened.  I purposefully stopped in to grab food from the deli and bakery for lunch yesterday and there were no menus posted, no prices and not an ounce of ready-to-go food aside from baklava.  It was 12:30pm.  What the heck?  I decided to wander over to the bulk food section and as I was browsing, I saw a moth flying around in one of the nut containers.  Gross.  That has turned me off enough that I'll never darken the doors again."}
{"text":"Very good prices and always find unbeatable deals to make whole week groceries... like it for sure will shop frequently from them!"}
{"text":"This used to be an Office Depot - but I'm glad it changed to a nice little food store. I shouldn't say 'little', because it's actually pretty big! I was under the impression that it was purely Indian food, but to my surprise they sell a wide array of food from every culture! I even got a box of German chocolates (with limited English on the box) for my husband, who works nearby. This is a great place to shop ethnic (but pay attention to due dates and NEVER buy anything that has a sale sticker slapped over where the due date should be visible!)"}
{"text":"This is the Best place to shop for Middle Eastern /Asian/Indian and Pakistani food. Where else can u buy goat or camel meat and halal 100%.   Olives from all over the world and the mouth watering fresh Baklava that they bake fresh daily on site is a must try next time you are in Basha Foods International.   OLIVE Oil asle will be so confusing they must have over 25 kinds of imported olives oils."}
{"text":"Dear Basha,  This is the second occasion I have purchased expired food from your store.  Charging a premium price for a double cream feta which is almost 3 months past expiry is appalling!  Had I lived closer to you, I would have thrown it in your face.  The first time was you sold me expired goods was when you were at the Temple location and I determined it might have been because you were in the process of a move so the merchandise was not rotated and I let it slide, besides that thing has happened even at Superstore...well, fool me once shame on you...fool me twice...GO SCREW YOURSELF!  I would just once love to enter an establishment geared towards Arab/Mediterranean food and not have to double check expiry dates or question hygiene practices.  Speaking of hygiene practices- the meat pies do not taste like meat (anymore)...ewe.  Nice to lure your customers in the beginning with a quality product then pulling the switcheroo!  Fool me thrice?! NEVER!  This makes me seriously reconsider any purchase from you.  I might just leave it to purchasing pitas and jarred goods if I happen to be in the area at least that way I know I won't be second guessing myself and wondering if the expiry dates are true or if a sticker that is ambiguously placed somewhere is one you printed yourself in order to salvage your stock!  Shame on you...no wonder this place is up for sale.  Good luck with that, you seriously need it.  Hopefully the new owners can make a difference and then you might win me back."}
