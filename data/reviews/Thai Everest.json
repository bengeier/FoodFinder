{"text":"This place is way over priced in this neighborhood! Everything is additional, including veggies! Service is horrible because the owner is the waiter, the chef, and possibly the dishwasher. He's always in the back so you'd have to ring the bell on the counter for any service! Not to mention there was only one other table plus ours so I'm not sure what he's doing in the back all this time. 

The food is suppose to be made to order but was barely warm when it arrived. We ordered beef but was given chicken instead, he did offer to make another one for us, but we didn't want to wait. He then came by later and told us it's chicken breast and very expensive! Not sure how that is of any importance to us, but perhaps he just wanted us to know? He did offer us a complimentary drink for his mistake. 

As for the food, it was very blend. The Pad Thai sauce tasted more like ketchup and peanut butter. The veggie vermicelli was like a mix if leftover veggies mixed together with some broken pieces of noodles with some burnt pieces from the wok. 

Take a drive somewhere else, wasn't even worth with a Teambuy coupon!"}

Thai Everest supposed to be a \"franchise\"? As it said please call a certain number for franchise information?!

The menu is really simple with all the safe bet: pad thai, green mango salad, curry, noodles, fried rice....

Lunch Special from 11am to 3 pm is written on the chalkboard on the sidewalk outside the restaurant...and of course I ordered:

Chicken Pad Thai Lunch Special ($6.66)
- It is exactly has it is described in the menu: Stir Fried and Tossed in Tamarind Sauce, Tofu, Green Onion, Peanuts and Egg Garnish with Lemon and Orange
- It just way over sauced and tasted gluey and really stuck to my mouth... 
- white meat chicken though a healthy option but tastes a little dry and bland....

Service is though really good as I have one on one service. My waitress came and check on me and making sure everything was OK....

The set up does feels like I am in a rural part of Thailand.... nothing Thai about it bur more like a sport bar.... 

Please note: Grand Opening Special no longer in effect but their online menu and store menu both not updated."}
