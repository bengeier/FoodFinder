{"text":"This place was so good it prompted me to write my first yelp review. The food was amazing and affordable, as was the beer/wine list, and the staff was very friendly. I loved the chicken parmigiana, and the spumoni was to die for! Very highly recommended!"}
{"text":"sad to report that i literally grew up at this place and it just isnt the same. miss the old feeling."}
{"text":"Being from New York where there are hundreds of Italian restaurants, I was surprised to find the best Italian food I've ever had at Dino's Place in Cleveland. The staff is friendly and the food is delicious! I especially liked the cavatelli and the homemade bread. Dino's Place is definitely worth another trip back to Cleveland."}
{"text":"Amazing homemade food at unbeatable prices.  Soups, bread, pasta, pizza, sauce, all from scratch!  It might not look like much from the outside, but this place is a secret gem."}
{"text":"Delicious Italian food that can't be compared to any chain restaurant!  Everything is homemade and absolutely the best Italian food to be found in a restaurant.  From the homemade pastas and sauces to the veal and chicken dishes, you can't go wrong!  The breakfast is also something to enjoy with fluffy pancakes, scrumptious omelets and Frittatas!"}
{"text":"Had a Cod Fish Fry last Friday night. While I wasn't impressed with the fish, the homemade pasta was good as was the New England Clam Chowder"}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Huge portions of food that taste like they were made by your Grandma. Stay away from the chain restaurants and support your local businesses."}
