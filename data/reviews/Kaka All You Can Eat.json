{"text":"We first came here during their first month opening and it was 5/5 stars! Now we're back a few years later and it has slipped down a bit, especially in terms of presentation, portion sizes, and menu choice. They used to decorate and plate the dishes very well, but now it's just on a white dish. They used to give you exactly what you ordered, but now they give you a much smaller portion. For example, we ordered six pieces of shrimp tempura and 10 pieces of Korean beef ribs, and we got two and four, respectively. Also, they had way more choices before, but now their menu offering has shrunk, especially the dessert section. Overall, I would give it 3.5/5 stars, but I think it's still better than most ayce sushi restaurants in the area, in terms of their food. Their torched sushi was still good, like before, and the overall quality of their food is pretty fresh, although many of the dishes are on the salty side. Dinner for two with one can of Diet Coke, plus tax and 15% tip cost $77.94, so it's definitely not a cheap meal. If you factor in the price, there are probably better options for sushis ayce in the area."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my experience here for the first time! Especially loved the torched sushi and cute little deserts, wine and beer list was great too. We were the only non asian people in the restaurant but our server and hostess was very nice and we had a lovely time. Will be back sometime soon."}
{"text":"Hands down best AYCE sushi in The GTA. Get the torched sushi.  Make sure you make a reservation cause it can get super busy."}
{"text":"It's impossible to make reservations at this place. The phone goes directly to voice mail. However, that's not my reason for the poor rating. We got lucky and were seated right away at the sushi bar (it would be approx an hour wait for a table even though there were empty tables for reserved customers). The selection was extremely small compared to other AYCE restaurants. I guess their specialties are the poke bowls, torched sushi, and pressed sushi - so they thought they can just skim on everything else. Worst of all - the sashimi was tasteless. They didn't taste bad, they just had NO TASTE at all. Their specialty items were good, I'll give them that; but it was NOT worth the $28.99 for a weeknight AYCE. I came here 3 times in total - once when they first opened and it was one of the best AYCE places out there. The 2nd time was a few months later and it was already just so-so. This recent visit was the absolute worst. Everything went downhill. I will not return again."}
{"text":"Hot food is decent, but the sashimi is bland, pale and lacks flavor, its obviously previously frozen. Sushi menu lacks several basics found at other places such as the butterfish. For the price I think it's terrible value when there are better quality ayce places for less that are also not as busy."}
{"text":"We came in on a weekday at around 5 and we were seated right away without reservations. I'm not sure how common that is though. By the time we left nearly 2 hours later the place was a lot busier. The service was alright. The waitresses were polite.  I think my expectations coming in were too high regarding the food. It was ok. The torched sushi was one of the better things we ordered. I also really like the lamb and mashed potato dish. The mussels were meh. The oysters were much better. The desserts were ok but a couple of things were disappointingly unavailable. I feel like if something is unavailable, I shouldn't be tempted by pretty pictures and have my hopes crushed when I try to order it. All in all, it was ok. I'd give it a 3.5 if I could."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch. Lots of people, better to reserve if possible. The highlight for me is the grilled sushi. I really enjoyed it, gives a different taste. Its rather rare to have that in an all you can eat. The sushi is also good as well. Will go back again, but cost will add up pretty quickly."}
{"text":"I tried making a reservation during the first 2 weeks when they had the grand opening special, but it was impossible! We ended up coming for dinner on my sis's birthday on a Wednesday about 3 weeks ago. Sis called a week ahead to make a reservation. We were very excited to try this place out since the first handful of reviews were so good.   We had a reservation at 7pm, and got our table right away. We were told there was a 2hrs limit, but we were not rushed out at 9pm. Service was prompt. Almost everything came out really quickly and in the correct amount. There were no missed items, except a few dessert items near the end which I assumed maybe ran out. There was maybe 1 or 2 items from our 1st round that didn't show up till near the end, but it came none the less. The pictures on the iPad ordering confused us at first since we didn't know every order was 1 pcs only, except the maki rolls which had the number of pcs listed. Emptied dishes were also removed relatively quickly. One lady (I assumed was a manager), came by near the end of our meal to see if we were getting all our food.   For the food, there are some unique items you won't find at other Japanese AYCE, even though the menu might be a bit smaller than some of the other ones. ~Pressed & Torched Sushi were good. I liked the torched ones more than the pressed ones though. ~Sashimi was fresh, but didn't have a lot of choices. ~Skewers were ok. Not a big fan of the spice powder than put on them. Pork Belly was really dry. Chicken soft bone was good. ~Tempura items. My mom said the batter was too thick. I didn't eat them.  ~Grilled items were good. My dad really like the grilled fishes and I liked that there were some grilled vegetable items like zucchini, mushroom & asparagus, besides the standard eggplant  ~Tried the Honey Mustard Shrimp, Beef Tataki & Crazy Dragon Crazy Rolls. All were good.  ~Lobster Bisque was a good alternative to miso soup, though nothing really special about it. ~Spring egg, braised lamb with mash potato, quail, baked mussel & oyster. The more unique items were all a-okay. ~I liked the baked avocado & cheese. Had lots of chucks of avocado underneath nice melty cheese. Unlike that dark brown mushed up stuff I've had at other places. ~I also liked that they had ika sushi, one of my favs. You will be surprised you might not find them everywhere. ~Dessert was also overall good. Favs were the mango & lychee granita, creme brulee, & the cheesecake cup.  There were a few items we wanted to try, but the menu said they were unavailable. Not sure if they ran out for the night or they weren't available on weekdays. Sitting was comfy with all the pillows along the bench. Weekday Dinner was $24.99 per person. Oh another thing, service charge is not added automatically onto your bill.   Overall, I think it is one of the better AYCEs. I would return, perhaps in a few months when hopefully all the hype has died down a bit to see if they are still as good."}
{"text":"No wonder it's called Kaka. The rolls were so disappointing.. very overrated and expensive. Everything was so bland. The only good thing was the dessert."}
{"text":"This is the best AYCE sushi place I've been to because of the overall dining experience.  In addition to offering a superior selection of innovative, high quality dishes, the environment is also a cut above other similar establishments.  The tablet menu was easy to use and the wait staff were friendly and efficient.  I also liked how the seating was well spaced so that you don't feel crowded next to your fellow diners like at other places.  All in all, we were able to enjoy our meal at a relaxed pace without feeling rushed.  Please note that we made reservations for dinner on a Monday night so the weekend may be different.  I would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"They messed up my birthday reservation a few weeks ago and my wife Joan reviewed them for it. They were very quick to correct the issue and we had an outstanding dinner for my post birthday dinner. Irene, Closs and our server were amazing. The staff is epic for their customer service. Definitely coming back again and thank you for making up for my birthday! The food was awesome with the weekend specials and the salmon sashimi yum yum!!!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try this new ayce sushi restaurant. I had to call one week in advance to reserve a table. Tonight I had reserved a table at 7pm. My friends and I arrived on time but we still had to wait about 15mins to be seated. Line up was crazy as usual, tons of people packed in the front door. Inside decor is pretty nice and cozy. The seats against the walls have pillows which adds a nice touch.   We had heard and read reviews that the torched and pressed sushi is really good. But to me it was just alright. The torched beef sushi and maki rolls were pretty good though. Also the pork belly and lamb skewers were yummy. Sashimi was fresh and good. They have a large selection of items and some that other ayce restaurants don't have. I would say the food is decent though, not that great. Zucchini tempura was way too soggy. Seaweed salad too dry. Spicy salmon sushi was meh. And they put too much sauce on their special maki rolls. The other cooked foods were ok, just like any other ayce restaurant.   I really enjoyed the desserts here. They have a big selection and unique items but I was too full to try them all. My favorite is the mango slush, vanilla creme brulee and the cheesecake. Kinda sad they didn't have chocolate ice cream and the red bean ice cream wasn't even available.  Service was surprisingly very good other than being seated 15mins late for a reserved table. Food came out pretty quick and didn't miss any items. Our waiter was super nice and made sure we were ok and got all our items. We got to stay 2.5 hours as there was another reservation after us.   Would I come back again? Maybe. But definitely not my first choice especially since I had to book one week ahead."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Sunday and even with a reservation we had to wait a little.  Food was generally good, but the waiting staff was consistently getting it wrong (wrong table) and not bringing water despite being asked several times.  I can normally put up with that but when it is $30 for lunch, I expect better."}
{"text":"This is a new AYCE sushi, the food is great specially the pressed sushi!! Come on weekend as they have specially pressed sushi such as scallops and blue fin tuna (1 piece per person). Their fish is fresh but has minimal choice on sashimi. Most of the nice fish come in sushi (with rice) but the size is acceptable.   Make sure you make reservation before you come and it is always pack. Call couple days ahead!!"}
{"text":"All I can eat! That is enough for that price and quality. I ate salad, sushi, sashimi and dessert too. I liked there Mango smoothie too. I'll definitely go again with my friends."}
{"text":"Honestly not worth the money. Their pressed sushi was just ok, and everything else were mediocre as well - maybe a little better than most AYCE places out there at a lower price. They do have a wide selection of choices there (I've seen more though). The most memorable dish of the night was actually the crème brûlée"}
{"text":"Service: 4/5 Food: 2/5  I've been to KAKA once in the summer and once today... Today was my last visit... Ever.   The first time was good. Food was good and very high quality, but after my visit today, I can't say the same anymore. The food was extremely greasy and non flavourful. The pressed sushi was made poorly because it literally falls apart as soon as you pick it up, which unfortunately caused us to waste a few (sorry). The desserts have also downgraded a wholeeee lot as the selection has decreased and the taste is nothing like what it's supposed to taste like. We ordered the jasmine creme brûlée and the earl grey ganache. Please steer clear of the jasmine creme brûlée as it was probably the most vile creme brûlée I've ever had in my life. I'm not exaggerating when I say vile. As for the earl grey ganache, it did not taste bad but it did not taste like earl grey which disappointed me. Other than that, everything was mediocre and slightly below average. Will not visit anytime soon."}
{"text":"Seriously...4's and 5's?!  It's another AYCE sushi made by non-japanese always deservedly a 2.5 to 3 star rating.  The food is decent (like all the rest) and the staff are relatively quick.  But for $30 for lunch!?  I guess being the only AYCE to serve sashimi at lunch makes up for the price.  Drinks are extra!  There were a few items on their ipad menus that were out of stock, which wasn't cool because I like to fill myself up with the most $$$ foods i.e. quail.  I like to start off my meal with a nice unagi handroll.  What I got was a huge handroll of rice and an iddy-biddy piece of unagi, WHAT A JOKE, same with the rolls!  Must be an eel shortage or something.    SO what makes this restaurant unique from another AYCE sushi?  Maybe the torched charcole-ness sushi?  The middle chicken wing, cut in half to make the bowl look fuller?  I'm stumped...."}
{"text":"I've been here several times now, but I feel like the quality this time was inferior. The sashimi quality was mediocre. Salmon didn't really taste like anything. The torched sushi are still my favourite- very nicely seasoned. However, I felt like the better tasting rolls/sushi pack in too much rice so we got full really quickly. The desserts were so-so. Variety has also decreased, I think. Overall I still like this place and would come back again but hopefully they can improve their sashimi quality. Weekend dinner was $33 per person."}
{"text":"One of the best AYCE places I've been to! Akin to Spoon and Fork, it offers a variety of dishes that you won't get at another AYCE place. It's very busy, and we tried making reservations 3 hours prior without any luck. Call around 12-2 pm that day to ensure a reservation, if not earlier.   Specialities include: lamb kabobs, torched sushi, and a variety of speciality desserts, such as green tea creme brulle, chocolate lavender pudding, lychee mango icee, etc."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place manage to get a 3 1/2 stars. Horrible experience. From making reservation to the bad mannered manager with an attitude.  I called at around 3:30 to make a reservation for that evening and they told me there is no more opening for 7:00 but 5:00 6:00 8:00 and 9:00 are all open which is normal and I was ok with that.  After I confirmed with my friends and called them back about 45 mins later, I only got a message saying \"all their agents are busy\" (really?! I thought this is a small restaurant and they have call centre agents?) and got put on hold listening to music. So after 10 mins I thought maybe their phone system has a glitch because there can't be so many people calling them. I had to go out do I call them from my car and was on hold again, this time I got curious and pissed so I decided to drive to the restaurant to see what is going on. I got there while being on hold for over 20 mins. I walked in, the place was half empty and someone was standing at the reception chatting with someone. They were chatting for a while and I finally got eye contact with the lady and she just gave me a rude look and continued chatting away with her friend. After a while they were done and she looked annoyed and asked me if I have a reservation. I told her I was trying to make a reservation but was on hold on the phone for over 30 mins. She then told me they don't have any openings. I told her that I was giving a option for 4 different times slot less than an hour ago so why would there be no openings! She just shakes her head and said their seats go fast so I should have made the reservation when I could. Come on, I don't think they have a call centre to take reservations, it was just that she rather chat with her friend or too lazy to answer phone calls. I mean, that's fine but don't put people on hold indefinitely. She was rude and have this \"I don't care because I control who gets in\" attitude, she should not be in the services business. I would definitely stay away from this place because based on recent reviews from other people, their food is getting worse as well."}
{"text":"It was good but not THAT good. Pretty unique items on the menu, and the compressed sushi was actually quite tasty. However, there were a lot of items I had wanted to try after looking at reviews but many were not available... kinda disappointing. Regardless the sashimi was really thickly cut and fresh and overall the food was a thumbs up from me."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of AYCE sushi: Not until trying KAKA All You Can Eat in Markham. Outstanding customer service meets an exceedingly above average AYCE selection of sushi from seared salmon and tuna to oysters baked with cheese, excellent tempura vegetables, delicious rolls (must try the Las Vegas roll, which is a deep fried Philly roll: amazing) and a nicely curated range of desserts that include a fresh, tangy mango slush that works as a perfect pallet cleanser.   Make a reservation or be prepared to wait: we waited 15 minutes and were first seated at the bar, and then switched to a table, which we really appreciated. The food was served extremely quickly, and, like I said, the customer service was excellent.   Impressed by the food, impressed by the service, just totally impressed by this AYCE location.  So impressed, I'd drive 45 minutes any day to eat here again."}
{"text":"Love this place .Service is great. I liked their sushi .It was fresh. We were lucky to get table with no reservations. Sashimi ,Oysters ,Mussels,Skewers and deserts were my favorite. The order comes out pretty fast too."}
{"text":"I was accidentally charged twice, left a review and Kaka immediately got in touch with me to rectify the issue. The manager followed up with a phone call after some time seeing that I haven't been able to schedule a time to return to the restaurant for a refund, again reassuring that she was happy to make the refund at my convenience. I am satisfied with the way Kaka handled the situation."}
{"text":"Came here on a friend's recommendation.  It is probably the best AYCE Japanese place in Markham at the moment.  The torched sushi (salmon, beef, & tuna) was the highlight.  Love grilled (Asian) eggplant.. They serve it whole.  Place gets very busy.  They gave us an expectation that it was timed reservation.  Glad we had reservations.  There was a line up by the time we left around 7.30pm on a Wed. (Summer holidays?)  Staff - friendly."}
{"text":"Worst experience for AYCE sushi. Sashimi's are not fresh, both my girlfriend and I are feeling sick after the first round of Sashimi, which stopped us from ordering anything else after.   We were seated at the \"bar\" as all tables were full, which was the worst choice. The waiter/waitress had to constantly grab food for other tables from the bar where we had to make a way for them. Also, by sitting at the bar, we saw at least two Sushi makers not wearing gloves when handling food, which makes me wonder how we got sick.   There was also a STRICT two hour limit, which no one had informed us when we sat down. I've never see any other AYCE enforces the eating time so strictly, and not like there was a line at the door, it was close to 9PM and way passed dinner hour.   All in all, $70 for dinner for two is way overpriced for the experience we've had. We came here because of all the hype for this place, but will definitely not return."}
{"text":"Had an awesome experience here! Unbelievably rich in flavour, in every bite a flavour kicks after the other. Highly recommended if you want your mind blown!"}
{"text":"The blowtorch sushi was good, but I feel like everything else was mediocre. I feel like they don't have as many choices for sashimi compared to other aye places and not all the desserts were available when I was there.  Something I noticed about their staff is that they make an effort to speak to you and come by introducing each dish, which was a nice plus in comparison to other places in Markham. Food came really fast and filled up the table since we only had 2 people.  Booking a reservation was a pain through the phone and also had to book weeks in advance. I don't think I would come again as it's always packed - maybe when there's less people."}
{"text":"The food was excellent, lots of varieties ... Walked in and was able to get a seat quickly. Nice resto Will come again"}
{"text":"The service is too slow. Among all my orders they just serve sushi. You have to wait 15 minutes for just one skewer of meat. If you go with your friends or family you will find there a meeting room since you have to speak to each other. It was awful"}
{"text":"3.5 but rounded up bc they deserve a better average than most other ayce places.  The quality of the food is solid and they have pretty good variety on their menu.  I did find that their blowtorch sushi was a bit overdone, some of the pieces were nearly cooked through and thats not what I expect with blowtorch sushi.  They also have a tendency to slather way too much sauce on some of their grilled items (mushroom, eggplant) that becomes too overppwering and kind of...goopey and messy.  I also found it strange that their vegetables are also ordered piece by piece, it makes sense for the other items but I was not expecting to be served a single slice of mushroom and a small section of asparagus.   I guess I know better now if I go again."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. All the food was amazing.  The staff were very nice and I recommend it to anyone who loves sushi and sashimi . And You order with an iPad . We've tried a bunch of all u can eat sushi restaurants and the reviews brang us to this one . The selection and quality is good. Its worth a visit."}
{"text":"Came to this restaurant with friends again for lunch menu instead of dinner this time. We ordered our favorite one sashimi set and two sushi sets for our lunch meal. Apparently, it's quite different in terms of its atmosphere in the afternoon from the evening time. There were not too many people crowded in the restaurant around this period of time. However, we really enjoyed the moment with a quiet, trendy, cozy and full of background music ambiance even better than a noisy restaurant. On the other hand, all sashimi and sushi set came out so fresh and delicious as expected with miso soup and salad at a set price of $12.99 and $9.99 respectively. More importantly, they're so filling that you would feel so satisfying....."}
{"text":"I usually don't write reviews, but this place had such bad customer service people need to know!  I've been to this location twice and first experience was pretty good. Food was good and atmosphere was great. I've recommended it to my friends as our new \"place we need to try out\". The sushi was good and they had a great selection on their desserts which is a plus!  Fast forward to a year later, I make reservations for a Christmas dinner for my family about 1.5 months in advance! Once December came around, I called to ask if it was possible to increase my reservation table cause I had more family coming with me. Instead of \"unfortunately we cannot do that because we're fully booked\" I got a very annoyed and unpleasant response of the waiter blaming me for not calling them earlier and a lecture from them saying that if I wanted to change my reservation I needed to call them earlier. I totally understand their point, but their delivery is rude and customer service is extremely poor. Although the food is good, it doesn't make up for their poor service and snobby attitude."}
{"text":"- Portions are smaller then other AYCEs, so it's a good portion to try out different kind of food (i.e.: rolls, skewers, etc) - Salmon sashimi was fresh and cut in a just right portion (not too big, not too small) - Beef sashimi was good - The rolls surprisingly tasted good (didn't recall the names but in general they are all good) - Food came fairly quick (the order itself could be hit or miss sometimes, but just order more if they forgot something) - Green tea and vanilla creme brule tasted good, as well as the mango lychee slushi. The rest were just ok - Service was very quick and prompt  The only drawback is making a reservation could be a bit of a challenge, and I would not recommend coming in without one.  All in all, we would definitely go back if we wanna go for a planned sushi buffet splurge."}
{"text":"Lunch a la carte review   Was here on a weekday around 1 for lunch, the restaurant was quite empty at this hour which was great. The servers were very attentive and also had great smiles which is unexpected from sushi restaurants uptown. Definitely made the experience more enjoyable.   From the rave with the torch sushi, of course we had to get the torched sushi combo ($18) and we also wanted to try the grilled salmon teriyaki bento ($13). The portion for the bento was quite generous and was the perfect amount for 2 people. Came with standard soup and salad. We also got a choice of dessert that day I believe because to make up for not offering the AYCE meal, which was a bonus for us as we had intended for the a la carte option anyway. The torched sushi is a must try! Definitely something different and worth the hype. The salmon bento was also great as well, salmon was not dry and tempura was not overly covered by tempura batter. A little steep in terms of price for lunch if you want a taste of torched sushi, but if you are looking to indulge- this is one of the places to go."}
{"text":"Went in there on a Sunday afternoon around 5:30pm and there were several tables for 2 people available and we were told there is only place at the bar. I said there is a empty table over there and after 10 seconds the waitress agreed myself and my coloured friend can use the empty table located between 2 other 2 people tables that didn't look pleased that 2 coloured people were there while the waitress looked over at the people beside us as with a failed attempt to not seat coloured people beside the other customers expression. Before we sat down we were told he had to eat and leave by 7. After a minute thinking about how we were told we could only go to the bar when there were empty tables then told he needed to leave by 7 and the waitress looking over at the other customers with a apologetic look that she is bringing coloured people near them I said to my friend \"screw this place, we are out of here\" and took our money elsewhere. Did not eat the food, it could be good but got no interest in dealing with their treatment of coloured people"}
{"text":"Ill make this short and simple.   You need to make a reservation ahead of time. My friends and I did not know this, and we waited 1 hour and 30minutes for a table.  Their iPad system is a very efficient way of getting your orders in.  On the food side, I wouldn't say this is the BEST all you can eat sushi place there is, but it is defiantly worth trying. Everyone keeps telling me the torched sushi is good, however when I had mine, it tasted like butane. Handrolls were good, Sushi rolls however all tasted the same. Dessert was good.  Like I said. Pretty good place to go to, good atmosphere. Not the BEST all you can eat sushi restaurant. Worth trying though."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Amount of porton was So small and tiny We Actually had to order So many times on the same item tO get sufficient in order to satisfy our stomach... Service was not spectacular neither? Good to try it out once?Will Not go back again."}
{"text":"Thought was an awesome concept to charge a bit more to bring people the torched sushi options at an Ayce sushi place. Finally someone is doing something a bit different than any other Ayce....  The food was good. Noticed a lot of the menu items are diff than other Ayce. There is a lady that walks around... Not sure if she's the owner or manager... But seems quiet pleasant and accommodating. Our table didn't have a reservation,  but was able to squeeze us in. Was told we had a 1 hr eating time because there is a reservation after us. We went over....but still didn't rush us. Also,  came to ask of everything came out.. If not she would rush the kitchen to ensure the items came out for us. Pretty good service for an Ayce sushi..."}
{"text":"They no longer have the sweet shrimp anymore. Torched sushi are actually pretty good.  Overall it's an average ayce"}
{"text":"Came across this place when I was researching what to eat on a Weds night, but realizing how difficult it was to get a spot I pretty much gave up. After a few calls, the guy told me that all the reserved tables were fully booked; but he was also nice enough to tell me that they had some walk-in tables available but I just had to walk in. So I decided to give it a try. Got there 6:20ish, he was able to give us a table and said he needed the table back by 8 as there was a reservation. Of coz we took the table, so that was done in less than 5 mins :)  Placing your order using an iPad, pretty much like what Spring Sushi (if you had been to one) used to do. If you put 1 for quantity, most of the stuffs just literally come in 1 piece (except rolls). The torched grilled sushi (Tuna, Salmon, Beef) and the pressed sushi are the musts, good thing is sushi is not so heavy on rice..normally I don't like ordering sushi. Ox tongue, pork belly, lamb, quail skewers are quite unique. Shrimp skewers are pretty good too. Baked avocado and cheese has big chunks of avocado, and lots of cheese. Beef sashimi, even if you order 50 pieces, you won't see much as they are thinly sliced and small pieces; they are a bit on a lean side for our taste. Other sashimi is decent, pretty fresh. One thing I was totally sold on was baked oyster with cheese; they are small oysters, but still oysters. Creme Brulee (vanilla & green tea) is very smooth; mango yogurt is a little too thick; the slush is pretty neat; greentea ice cream is really good, strong matcha taste (if you like it); the cheesecake cup is pretty smooth, but too much berry sauce for my taste; meant to try sticky toffee pudding, but they missed the order.   Services are very prompt and polite. I think the place runs out of plates at the back, because I never seen wait staff would be waiting to collect your plates; which is good as the tables are pretty small. Before 7pm, we got our orders very fast; 1 minute after I pressed the send order button, our food would be coming already. But it does get busy after 7, and they missed some items we ordered; no biggie as we got stuffed by then anyway.    I would definitely recommend the place, and I would definitely return :)"}
{"text":"Food wise 4/5 stars. Service, absolute bulls***.   The servers (e.g. Oscar) literally count down your 90 minute seat time by the minute. Worst of all, our total dining time was more of less about 1hr 10minutes. We felt so rushed and his service to be so rude that night. Much better off to go to Kiku sushi nearby instead. Avoid at all costs if you respect yourself. Unbelievable in this day and age."}
{"text":"Extremely awful service , waiting ages for ages for foods. The manager there was mentioned that  ONE HOUR time limit !!! However We had to wait  20 mins for one item!! Nonetheless We were having desserts but the waitress asked to pay the bill before finishing it."}
{"text":"Not a big selection but the food was very fresh and quick. My kids love the mango slush and sashimi. Anne was our waitress, she was very patient with my three kids.  She kept on checking on us, which was a plus."}
{"text":"I made a reservation for a Saturday one week in advance with no problems. We came about 10 minutes before our reservation and were seated within 2 minutes. The servers were always around to clear the table or grab napkins for us.  The food selection looks great on paper but there were a lot of items that weren't available to try like the truffle carbonara udon. Without those special items, Kaka is pretty much the same as any other AYCE sushi place. Definitely worth a try if you are curious but won't be back again for the price point or until every item advertised is available."}
{"text":"They only have 2-3 types of sashimi. very disappointed, the sushi rice is over cooked, you cannot tell what fish is being used if you didn't see. definitely not recommended for sashimi lover."}
{"text":"Went here for a non AYCE lunch and pricewise it wasn't that bad. I still spent less than $15 for a bento box with sushi and other things. The place is really nice, modern looking and more spacious than some other places."}
{"text":"I had a torched sushi bento box lunch during a weekday. And..  it was surprisingly bad!  The fish didn't taste fresh... the flavours were not pleasing... nor the textures... rice in the pressed sushi was too smushed...   This may be TMI, but I had a stomach ache mid-meal and had to leave the table... after returning and finishing my meal, I had ANOTHER stomach ache, and had to leave the table.(!)  I wouldn't be surprised if it was induced by the food, as it seemed off somehow.  I did like the miso soup though - it had some depth of flavour. Um, other than that... the little orange slice was good... :(     I've had delicious torched sushi at a different restaurant in Toronto, so in comparison, this was quite disappointing. Also, I'm not a fan of pressed sushi from this experience, as it was too dense/tightly packed."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Average service. Must call ahead like at least a week in advance to get a table.  Very small location, very cluttered, uncomfortably seated"}
{"text":"I leave a reservation here because I couldn't get seated the day before. Upon arriving early just in case I still need to wait, I find out my name wasn't even put on the list. What's the point of picking up my call, taking down my name and number if you're not going to put me on the list. I just want some sushi and you have managed to ruin my night two days in a row.   Edit: OK the food was aite. Felt bad for leaving so few stars. Change from 1 to 4 stars."}
{"text":"Food quality I would give it 4 stars. Unfortunately it's expensive, and hard to book a table (granted, biz is too good). I hope the price would come down, otherwise it's not likely that I'll go again."}
{"text":"This place is crazy!  Came to experience the all you can eat madness with a large-ish group of people.  We took up two tables, which meant we received 2 ipads for the ordering.  This was initially okay, but then we mixed up the ipads, and didn't realize that 1 ipad was for 1 table and the other ipad was designated for the other table.  This made for some confusion when placing orders and the orders arriving at the incorrect table.  Overall I had a great time.  The food came fast, and was plentiful.  The desserts are SO worth saving a little extra space for, and are the perfect size!  I had to be rolled out of the restaurant as i was soooooo full!"}
{"text":"WORST AYCE EXPERIENCE EVER. I decided to try KAKA because of all the hype about this restaurant. First of all, they require reservations for dinner times, but they do not let you reserve online. They make you give them a call and put you on hold between 20-30 minutes MINIMUM. The food was not in good quality and the fish was not fresh. They only allow maximum seating time of an hour and a half, but the food I ordered first came out last. How do you expect people to finish in the time limit if the food never comes out on time. The food quality was not worth the wait and their service was below mediocre. I do not recommend this restaurant AT ALL."}
{"text":"I WILL NEVER EVEN GO THERE AGAIN.  TOTALLY UNORGANIZED AND I DO NOT BELIEVE A RESTAURANT LIKE THAT CAN DELIVER GOOD FOOD.  The website says business hour is 11:30 am to 11:30 pm, so I got there on Saturday and they are not open. I called more than 5 times and no one picked up the phone, however I can see there are some staff inside the restaurant... Well...I tried again on Sunday night and the waitress told me they only take reservation and you cannot get any reservation now. Until this point, I am kinda pissed off but still understandable. However, the waitress gave me bad attitude when I asked her how can I make reservation if no one picks up the phone.  They are TOTALLY not organized at all and I do not want to try their food any more. I DO NOT BELIEVE A RESTAURANT LIKE THAT CAN DELIVER GOOD FOOD. I WILL NEVER EVEN GO THERE AGAIN."}
{"text":"Wow.. I expected a lot because when it first opened it was so highly rated. This reminded me WHY I only ate a la carte. Be careful of people who rave about restaurants on social media.  Honestly, how dare you charge someone for $35 dollars for AYCE when your menu is so small?The beef sashimi was sliced very odd- You need to use a mandoline. I think in terms of appetizers, they can take a page out of Sushi Legend on Huntingwood. While their food is mediocre,they charge at least 10 dollars less, and they have way more selections in terms of sashimi. The problem with Kaka is that all their cooked dishes are lukewarm. They skimp out on ingredients.   Really? Three fishes and imitation crab meat?  The grilled salmon was clearly cooked while frozen and not all the way through. I had a really bad stomach ache after.  Yes their torched sushi is one of their selling points, but the rice was kind of hard.  It's not that great aside from the presentation. Service was extremely slow- we had asked for  our bill 5 times. Aside from that, nothing else was good except their grilled okras. The menu is very small and majority of their dishes lack flavor. Even some of their desserts tasted odd to me, especially the mango pudding. I know you can't expect much from AYCE but for the price we were charged for, I expected it to have some things to stand out.   $150 for 4 people ( NOT including tips yet), I could have just spent it at Zen Sushi or downtown.. what a waste of money."}
{"text":"Went for dinner ayce   Hands down best ayce sushi around. Food was amazing with a decent selection.  Unfortunate they don't have tuna sashimi but their variety of sushi rolls make up for it.  Torched sushi wasn't as amazing as I had heard but it was still good nonetheless.  Dessert was decent, nothing too much to point out there.  Overall they provide top notch food with impeccable service albeit pricier than most ayce sushi restaurants."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time yesterday and had made reservations. Good was decent, fried food was on the salty side. Biggest complaint is the service and their ordering system, which was a compete mess. We were getting orders from the table next to us, and majority of the things we ordered did not come. Desert was the worse, we put our first through and it seems they were not capable to making enough for everyone because nothing came, the workers were all standing in the kitchen waiting for it to be made. With average food but incredibly slow service, I'm avoiding this place at all costs."}
{"text":"Went here with a couple of friends on Saturday. The decor and atmosphere was top of the line for an AYCE sushi place. The selection of food was ok. Service was just ok. Would have given them a 3star if weren't for the massive explosive diarrhea  followed that night."}
{"text":"I know Kaka AYCE sushi has been all the rage, and we admittedly gave in to the hype and decided to give it a try for a friends birthday. It was a Friday night and the place was packed! Make sure to make reservations before you go! I have to say their sashimi was exceptional and the quality and variety of food was pretty good too.  We went there again last night and took friends with us too. So this time it was a weekday and the place was still packed. But, the food was just average this time. The sushi and the rolls were just layers of rice over very flimsy portion of fillings. The sashimi slices were super thin. And over all everything was just average.  Clearly their quality has gone down over time!  Don't think will visit again!"}
{"text":"nothing to rave about. overall wasn't bad and it's all you can eat.  most of the desserts were bad though. mango lychee slush was fine though."}
{"text":"This is my favourite all-you-can-eat place! Only been once. But seriously. Really liked the AYCE! Exclamation!"}
{"text":"I went in for lunch, it so pricey but it's worth it. Some of the dishes were quite unique compared to other ayce places. I especially liked the torched sushi, it was so good. They also had more dessert choices than other places which is a plus. Will definitely return again."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday. Need to make reseverations before going. A-okay food. I liked the torched sushi :)"}
{"text":"Fast service and very professional staff. Quality is better than your typical ayce. Torched sushi is very interesting and worth try."}
{"text":"Location: South side of First Markham Place. Parking is a nightmare on the weekends but the place was still pretty dead. I completely forgot that Labour Day counted as a weekend so AYCE lunch was $28.99!! Holy! It included sashimi, but wow.  Facility: Clean, but they seated us (a family of 3) at a table for two between two other large tables while the rest of the place was empty.  Food Quality & Price: Sashimi was great, as was the desser selection. The beef tataki was absolutely sad. They came cut into slivers in a pile of mush.   Service: About 10 minute wait for your food after you order of an iPad. Table clearing was quick. The waitresses were friendly.  Overall: It was decent, but for that price, I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Service is really good. The food is tasty. We had dinner it comes up to 33$"}
{"text":"Honestly, I am not a fan for AYCE. I have not been to AYCE resturants more than 3 times in the last 5 years.  I preferred visiting a la carte restaurants especially when it comes to Japanese food.  However, since I am in love with blow-torched sushi after having them in JaBistro, I was highly attracted by KaKa due to its location being more convenient for me.   Thanks to the advice from other reviewers, I made sure my reservation was made 2 days before heading to the restaurant.  However, restaurant was still fully booked for the weekend unless I was willing to eat after 9 p.m. so I had to move my reservation to a weekday at 5 p.m. instead.  I was glad that decision was made as the restaurant was not as busy, food came out very fast and the servers were attentive.   The blow-torched sushi did not disappoint me, although it is no JaBistro, but quality of the sushi are definitely above average.  For the price you are paying, this is really a steal. Some of the hot food was just average but some skewers were pretty tasty. My sister was a huge fan of their conch skewer.  Desserts were phenomenal for an AYCE place, both in terms of quality and selection.  I will be a more frequent visitor of AYCE now thanks to KaKa."}
{"text":"this place is poop! so expensive and forced us to tip AT LEAST 15% percent. Food not that good, rather go to kiku or ichiban"}
{"text":"Had a great experience my second time around. Waited about 30 mins for a table. We were a table for 2 which is perfect for a walk in. For a Monday the place was packed. The hostess was very good and made sure to let us know that she's doing what she can ensure us a table quickly. She even offered us the wifi password while we waited.   Once seated the service was pretty good. There were some moments it was a little slow. There seemed to be less servers than the last time I was there. The food was good and worth the amount I paid. The only thing I had trouble with was the pork belly skewer, as good as it was, was very small in portion and only had one piece on the skewer.   There were some dessert items that were unavailable but I assumed it was due to popularity. Overall, I would definitely come back and even booked for December. The manager was very hospitable and attentive."}
{"text":"I have been waiting to eat here since it opened. And came here on a Sunday night. Service could be a little better as you nees to ask for water, wasabi,  ginger.. Many of the items were sold out which is a shame,  I mean I came at 8pm. The sushi was nothing out of the ordinary nothing stood out. A lot of the items tasted the same and the selection was low. The torched sushi was good but only the salmon, grilled items were good the lobster bisque and the clam and mussles were good. The rest was meh. Even the sashimi was meh. I could have gone to another ayce for a cheaper price and better quality. And then it was dessert time. I was so excited as they lots of options and the instagram pics were so appealing. There was no mango ice cream bummer,  I mean this should be a standard. The creme brule was really good.  The mango slush was not bad, the coffee dessert was ok. The rest is a no,  like no, don't bother. I left the restaurant not full and paid $75 for 2 people after tax and tip. Not worth it. And I didn't get the sushi complimentary platter. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"NO TIME TO EAT - Overall the food is good compare to most Japanese AYCE.  Torched sushi and dessert is the best.  But this place is so hard to get an reservation.  I called Sunday to book reservation for Friday and they only have 5pm or 9pm available.  I know this place is popular, so I don't mind taking late reservation for 9pm. But when arrived, we still have to wait until 9:20pm in order to get a table. Finished taking order at 9:30pm. But by 10pm, we were told that last call in 10min including desert. We just started eating  and it's time to finish our dinner with dessert.   They shouldn't take any reservation after 9pm, or to inform their guest that kitchen is closed at 10pm, even the restaurant closed at 11pm."}
{"text":"After many attempts, I was finally able to land a reservation at this popular AYCE joint. Dont be surprised if they put you on hold for god knows how long. If they answer the phone, go buy a lottery ticket. Upon arrival, the place was packed as usual. The seating was so tight that I felt as if I was sitting with the other patrons. The ipad menu + tea took about 7-8 minutes to arrive which was not impressive. The food came lightening fast, but was all mediocre at best.  Mussels and oysters with cheese was delicious as with many other AYCE. Their beef sashimi would have been amazing if it wasn't for the orange flavor in the sauce. Sashimi was the usual AYCE quality. Blow torch sushi was your typical sushi but with an added smokey flavor - nothing to die for. The only thing special about the pressed sushi was the rectangular shape of it.   The two dishes that stood out most was the Takoyaki (octopus balls) and the beef short rib. The octopus ball was about the size of a golf ball...but the amount of octopus inside the ball was unacceptable. We found only a 5mm length of a tentacle from an octopus. Next was the beef short rib. It should have been renamed beef short rib with tenderizer. The meat was so tender that it was suspicious. But what can I say? At the end of the day this IS an AYCE joint. I plan on sticking with a-la-carte from now on.   Never going back, bye."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food and service. Great torched sushi, nice flavours, and big juicy slices of sashimi. Maki rolls were perfect sizes, and rice wasn't too dense either. Dessert was great and the staff was very friendly and helpful. Ordering by ipad was trouble free and you can keep tabs on what's still coming. Can't complain about anything with these guys. Dinner was about $35 on a weekend. There are cheaper ayce sushi places for dinner in Markham, but these guys might be the best."}
{"text":"Great services, great quantities of food unlike other all you can eat placed. DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"Seriously overhyped, not worth the long waits. The food quality and menu items just really aren't that special compared to many other places. The presentation looks good, but the taste is so so.  They're known for their blow torch sushi which again is presented well, but honestly is mediocre. It's of slightly lower quality than many other places who serve blow torch sushi that I've eaten at (though to be fair most ayce don't have them, it's usually a la carte sushi restaurants).  The service was good and the food comes quickly. Not a bad experience but definitely nothing outstanding. If you want great blow torch this isn't the place, and you will be disappointed. But if you're primarily coming for a typical ayce experience, then the blow torch sushi will be a bit of a bonus."}
{"text":"Will never go back. Very expensive, food was not fresh and servers were rude and argumentative. Sushi was not at all fresh, the roles were mushi and drenched in mayo. The hostess argued with me over 10 minutes about splitting a table which was empty to seat us, because she wanted to seat us by the door on a cold night were draft was an issue. Needless to say, no one occupied that table the entire time we were there."}
{"text":"I've never been one to revise a review, but Kaka is definitely getting a down-vote.  I totally understand how AYCE sushi places are chaotic on Friday nights, but the last thing I expect to have happen is to be pushed out of a restaurant after only been there for one hour, when there's a two hour seating time.  Both the manager and the wait staff were accusing us of having been seated since 7:30pm.  We had to instruct them to double-check our reservation that was booked for 8pm and also the ordering tablet, which was time stamped for 8:05pm.  To add insult to injury, they weren't even apologetic when we pointed out the people at the tables around us had been at the restaurant far longer than us, which they then attempted to sweep their original accusation under the table by saying that they were only trying to remind us of the 2 hour seating time limit.  That's just total horse shit.  Not being able to own up to your own incompetence, nor doing your due diligence of checking the time, before accusing your clients of wrong-doing is unacceptable.  And it didn't help that the quality and presentation of the food was far worse than my previous visit.  Let's also add to the fact that this outing was with my best friend and her family, to celebrate her brother's birthday, I was definitely not impressed and will likely never return.  Again, I understand that Friday nights can be crazy, but c'mon, if you're gonna enforce a seating time limit, at least have competent staff that is able to get it right."}
{"text":"A friend and I have to wanted to try Kaka for some time now. It took us about a month to make reservations, but we got it. All this hype, gotta try. The atmosphere was \"classy\", as one of my friends had described it. We were seated by the wall where there are cushions.. very comfy. The service was amazing! The waitress came over and explained to us how the iPad ordering system works. The food came out quick. The pressed and torched sushi was okay... the maki sushi itself was just okay as well. The DESSERTS on the other hand was above and beyond amazing! cream brûlée, lavender chocolate pot, coconut greek yogurt to name a few.   I would recommend everyone to try it once and see for themselves. I might come back again."}
{"text":"My family came here for dinner on a Friday night. The restaurant wasn't that full. We read some previous reviews before we went and expected to order oysters and scallops, but unfortunately, they weren't on the menu that night! The sushi was average. We ordered some ramen, but after we came home, we were extremely thirsty. I doubt we'll ever return again. The food quality didn't justify the price at all."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate a birthday. Had to reserve about a week in advance.   We were seated right away and the server was great. She informed us how to order via the ipad and quickly gave us tea. I had no problem redeeming the Yelp coupon for a soft drink for checking in.  The sashimi and rolls were on par with most other AYCE Japanese places. However I really liked the torched sushi here. You can taste the burntness/char. The variety of hot/cooked foods were good. And the food came pretty quickly, which was a real plus. Desserts-wise, they were just ok. We were stuffed and only ordered one of each item to share.   It was a weekday and after tax and tip it was around $36pp."}
{"text":"Even though there are already ample reviews, I must talk about Kaka's (hot)  spring egg! This egg, my goodness, was cooked to perfection with a smooth and silky yolk interior that was not 'raw', but runny and rich in all the right ways. The dashi broth looked visually alarming due to the intense dark soy colour in which my brain had associated with being too salty. However, surprisingly the broth was light and had just the right  amount of sweet and salty. Big yum!  Moving on, my other highlights were the lamb skewers, lobster bisque, the novelty of the torched sushi and the variety of desserts offered (especially the Hokkaido milk creme brulee!)  The downers: The maki rolls were not that great, both in flavour and visually. Rice to filling ratio was off as well. Torched beef roll was too saucy, plus the sauce didn't taste that great. Lastly, I really wanted to try the sticky toffee pudding but that was unavailable.  Overall I had a good experience and the ambiance was hip and lively. Compared to other AYCE restaurants, Kaka is defintely at the top!"}
{"text":"What kind of restaurant will tell you \"we don't give out queue #, you will need to wait in front of the door with no confirmation.\" This is not even the worst part, you are also subjected to the lady's mental \"order sheet\" in her head for who will be the next one in queue. There is absolutely no way this will be considered anywhere close to acceptable standard. This restaurant must having the best AYCE sushi in GTA for people continue to put up with this and hopelessly waiting outside its front door."}
{"text":"Just had the AYCE experience earlier this evening at 7:00pm, we had lunch here on a weekday, they only serve regular lunch, they only offer AYCE on weekday nights and weekends.  The lunch we had was decent, so we decided to try the AYCE.  Anyway, I called this afternoon to make a reservation for 2 with a baby stroller, the person on the phone was very accommodating, even tho he told me he would give me a table for 4 so I can seat the baby on the banquette seat, but he only have the last seat for 2 ppl, and which is fine I told him I could just have his car seat detached fm the stroller and have it beside me on the banquette, which he offered to save me a corner seat for more space.   Services: For most AYCE sushi, they are known for bad services, however this is not the case at KAKA.  Like I mentioned earlier about my baby stroller situation, we got there at 7:00pm on the dot, the manager/supervisor promptly direct us to the corner seat.  To my surprise, he even rotated the table to give us more space for the baby car seat to be seated in the corner.  Our waitress was really nice, even tho we know how to use the Ipad order system, she still showed us how to order.  Through out the whole night, she was back and forth clearing our dishes away.  Other waiter and waitress were nice as well, when they put down the baked oyster, they ensure to tell you is very hot and be careful with it.  And also because we were being polite with them, we would thank you when they put down dishes or clear the plates. You see, you should treat ppl how you wanted to be treated.  They also have a 2 hour limit, for the whole dining experience, even tho it is fully packed and long line were waiting, we never felt that they are rushing us out.  And of course we leave before the 2 hrs mark.  When we were leaving, the lady owner (at least I think shes one of the owner) came out and told us it is a busy night and she wishes that she could have given us a better seat so we could have been more comfortable with the baby and thank us again for coming and happy that we enjoyed the food.  Food:  For AYCE, the food choices here are amazing compare to others.  Lobster Bisque - good, tasted ok for ayce Onsen egg - as per my hubby, it is good, but he likes the lobster bisque better.. Lamb skewer - great, can really taste cumin in it.  Pork skewer - great, very tender  wings - average, kinda blend beef tataki - average takoyaki - excellent, crispy & hot, the way it should be all blow torched sushi & pressed sushi - great, u did never see any other ayce offer this, but not torched enough to our liking           tako wasabi sushi - excellent On to the Dessert:::::: lavender chocolate pot - excellent, you can really taste the lavender green tea & regular creme brûlée - excellent, they torch it when you order, yummy mango slush - excellent as per hubby, really refreshing, but I find it really sour.  cappuccino mousse - so so as per hubby, not much coffee flavour in it. hokkaido creme brûlée, passion fruit banana cream, earl grey chocolate - not available tonight, what a shame  Setting: Love the banquette with cushion all over the place, nicely decorated.  Remember to make reservation, as this place is crazily packed at night.   All in all, I would go back again."}
{"text":"Very pedestrian didn't like that sashimi isn't included on the lunch menu could tell that some of the rolls had been made in advance rather than to order. Service was prompt but not very friendly. On the positive side their grilled meats were very good and included lamb which is a personal favourite"}
{"text":"I'm rating this restaurant on service because it was impossible to call and make a reservation.  The line is always busy or you get an answering machine.  So we went there in person to make a reservation.  When I arrived, I stood there for a long time and no body came to ask if I was dining in.  The restaurant was not busy during lunch hour and the 3 guys behind the sushi bar who wasn't working saw me but still didn't tell the waitresses.  There was a lady (I guess the manager) who was working on her own but her back was against the entrance so she couldn't see me at all.  Finally I walked up to the shushi bar and a waitress.  In the end I left without a reservation due to availability, but in all honesty, I had no desire to dine there anymore."}
{"text":"I paid $33 plus tax for all you can eat sushi. This is significantly more expensive than other all you can eat sushi places so you would expect better service but, this was not the case. Our waitress was rude and treated us very poorly. She told us we had a two hour limit to sit but our food was taking upwards of 30-40 minutes to get to us. At around the two hour mark she told us that it was our last call. Normally this would be fine but there were 3 tables around us that had been there before we got there and were still ordering. This bothered me the most. Also, by the time we were done we were missing a significant amount of food ordered. The food was good and was definitely more high quality than a cheaper place. I would not recommend eating here because you are paying more money but are still getting the service of a cheap, run down sushi place."}
{"text":"I have been to dozen of all you can sushi places, this one is in the top 10 percent.  There is the bad AYCE, average AYCE and you have the really good AYCE.  This one is considered a really good AYCE.  I want to keep this review short.  Bottom line, more attention to details to kitchen items.  They are definitely better in terms of kitchen items compared to other places.  They also have torched sushi which most other places don't offer.  Everything else is pretty much the same standard as other AYCE places.  Drinks are not free and if I remember correctly the per person price is a little bit higher.  Another cool thing is that they use iPads for ordering.  Also make sure you call on weekend, as they can get very busy and turn people down who do not have reservations."}
{"text":"I've never experienced service so slow at an AYCE before going to Kakas. It took more then 40 minutes for us to get our orders. As a result we got less food, some even forgotten because we didn't want to order more in case too much food ended up coming. We were there for two and a half hours. Thanks to that, we didn't get enough food before the server told us it was last orders. We couldn't get any of the things we DID like again, because we didn't get most of them until after this. If it was just for things that take longer to make, like the torched sushi, I'd completely understand but it  shouldn't take 30 minutes for a bowl of ice cream."}
{"text":"Great service but super average food. Some unique dishes but nothing special and definitely not worth the price. The menu is missing some of my favourite ayce dishes such as sushi pizza, salmon roses, coconut shrimp and so many more! Nice atmosphere, friendly staff but I do not believe that I will be returning."}
{"text":"Disaster:  1. Food is nowhere near the quality of other Kaka places 2. The hostess said it was 20 minute wait to get seats, ended up being 40. 3. The service took way too long, we spent more than 2 hours waiting for our food - even had to wait 20 minutes for the bill! The total amount of time we wasted at the restaurant was more than 3 hours.  And this was all with the restaurant being half full - the waiters blamed it on their software... doesn't really help the customers."}
{"text":"Definitely not worth the price. I went with high expectations as it took us forever to get a reservation.  The torched sushi was way over torched.  The fish was basically 50% cooked through. Nothing special at all. Pressed sushi was 80% rice.  Sushi I quality is ayce avg quality"}
{"text":"Delicious torched sushi, and a wide variety of desserts!  Waited for around 15 minutes although we had a reservation, but service was very fast and our waitress was extremely attentive.  Definitely would revisit."}
{"text":"Came to the downtown location with high expectations after having visited the Markham location a few times before. For the price they charge ($35 per person as of April 2018), the overall experience was very disappointing. Tables and seats were crammed. Service was slow. Menus were dirty. Various items ordered never came. Occasionally, the same item wasn't prepared the same way on different orders (e.g. blowtorched the first time, not torched second time). Freshness of the fish was average but adequate. All in all, I would rather spend the money elsewhere."}
{"text":"The best AYCE japanese restaurant I've been to. They offer a lot of items that are not offered else where (even at normal Japanese restaurants) such as touched sushi and pressed sushi. The dessert menu is quite extensive as well, offering far beyond the normal ice cream and fried banana selections.  Make your reservations well in advance as this place books up quick. I would also recommend going in smaller groups as it would make getting a table easier.  Also I would recommend going on the weekend. The extra few dollars you pay are well worth it as the weekend menu does offer a lot more."}
{"text":"Our group of four came for dinner on Tuesday night at 6 p.m. and were seated after a short wait (they only do reservations for groups of 6 or more, otherwise walk-ins are seated on a first come, first served basis which is fair). The restaurant was about a third full when we arrived and almost at capacity halfway through our dinner. If you want a table without a long wait, come just before the dinner rush.   Overall impressions: -The food was excellent. No qualifiers along the lines of \"well it was good, considering it was ayce\" needed. We started our meal off ordering various items from the aburi and tataki sections of the menu. To say that we enjoyed the flavours, textures, and presentation of the platters would be a major understatement. I also appreciate the fact the portions were relatively small (quite literally bite-sized) but still satisfying, plus it allowed our group of four to get a taste of everything we wanted without feeling like we were stuffing ourselves to the gills. I know it's ayce, but sometimes you really need quality over quantity.  -Wait staff were friendly, knowledgable and attentive without hovering -No issues with our orders (3 rounds ordered, got everything we asked for; last round was for desserts); glasses of water were refilled without asking throughout the meal; food was delivered to the table at a steady pace; empty plates were picked up promptly  Bottom Line: Is it worth the price of premium AYCE at $35 for dinner? Absolutely : )"}
{"text":"Tried calling them like 20 times. They never answer the phone to take reservation. I even walked in at 11am to try to book but the girl just told me we are not opened and walked back inside. Honestly don't give out your number if you never ever plan to answer the phone. I even call them knowing the girl was beside the phone sitting there. Still. What kind of customer service do you plan to get if they don't even know how to treat people well for taking reservations?  In response to the staff who reply to me;  My friend called like 10 times last week during the 2-5pm time frame required by your restaurant and left a voice message. I understand that the voice msg said that u guys will not call back but how do we ever know if we made a reservation if we can leave a msg but no one ever replies back? We also tried with several friends yesterday during your required time frame as well. Not once did you guys pick up. Why don't u guys just cancel the phone line until you have a system in place?"}
{"text":"Yummy .. Don't go if you don't have reservations , super busy , super quick , reservations about a one week wait ... If u go after 9:00 .. Your chances are higher of gettin a table .. But def good food"}
{"text":"Been here in the past and food and service was adequate. They raised their prices which deterred me from patronizing as often but I was in the mood for AYCE sushi on Friday. Called to make a reservation and was told they don't take reservations on weekends so I did the walk-in and was asked if I had a reservation. WTF?!? Was told it would be over an hour wait so I went next door to Din Tai Fung instead. Am so done with this place. \"Kaka\", how apropos."}
{"text":"Went here with my work colleges as a late Christmas celebration. The place is smaller than a typical sushi buffet and the decor is dark, classy, and modern. The food quality is quite fresh with a good variety to be content. Some of their special items on the menu is limited per person. Sushi Legend use to be my favorite, but now I have this one to add in my fav list of AYCE."}
{"text":"I am giving this place a 2 star for very good reasons. I initially started with a 4 star in my mind but it gradually lost point due to other factors. And here's why.   The first impression was good. The iPad ordering is very efficient and the food came at an incredible speed. It felt like they had some extremely efficient kitchen back there. But you'll soon realize that some items are cold. So I wouldn't be surprised if some of them are pre made in batch and just sitting there. For example. The torched sushi all came cold. However, the variety is very good. I like the huge array of choices. Hence 4 stars to start.   As the meal progresses, you realize that despite the billion items on the menu, they all taste the same. Of course beef taste different than salmon but if you were to compare the different torched sushi they have. Pretty much just one taste. Now I think it is expected at a all you can eat. Things just won't be too refined. So that lost a star because it was somehow advertised as a more premium joint. It really wasn't. It does charge a premium price though. We were 4 people and had a pitcher of beer. Came to 50 per person. Minus the beer it's around 45. So for that kind of money. It's steep. Actually it's expensive. It's certain not a good price to quality ratio. You'll get a better ratio going to an ordinary all la carte restaurant. You can get a large boat for $60-70 at a better sushi restaurant and it will happily feed 4. Come to think of it. Their food is at the same level as the T&T sushi. But at least they are good for the price.   So why the 2 star. Well. Perhaps due to the speed of food delivery and how it was probably sitting out to meet the demand. Kaka made me caca. I ran to the toilet multiple times during the night. It was explosive. My girlfriend puked in the middle of the night. So I'll rule out that this is only affecting me.   There you have it. Mediocre food at premium price that gives you diarrhea. I should give it a one star but I do give them credit for the efficient ordering and \"variety\" of choices."}
{"text":"Not nice at all and worst service ever. I will never go back.   1)The service was terrible. They just wrote it down on small teared paper. They cannot take order. They mixed up and keep forgetting what we ordered. We got some plate that we didn't order, we didn't get some that we ordered several time. Also, I saw that one server( she was working for other table) dropped the order paper after receiving order. But, she didn't recognize that she lost the order paper. 2)The food is edible..., but the quality  is not good enough for that much price. Their main dish were torched sushi and plate. But, it was pretty cold and poor quality beef:( 3)There are bunch of places for having very professional service with top quality food for this price."}
{"text":"GOOD FOR ALL YOU CAN EAT SUSH in markham! Love the press sushi.  Service is ok but the  food come very fast."}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic Japanese food, please look elsewhere. I've passed by this place many times and I always look at the bento boxes for lunch. Finally gave it a try and it went downhill very quickly. We ordered a chicken don rice, a bento box with tempura, and a bento box with sashimi. The chicken don tasted more like a dessert. The sauce was super super super sweet. The sushi from the bento box looked disgusting. I could see the finger marks on the rice on the sushi. The tempura batter was super buttery and thick. Huge portions, but tastes terrible.   I've never been to kaka for AYCE, but if they can't make anything as simple as the lunch bento boxes, I can't imagine the AYCE being better, only worse. Yes quantity and price is very attractive, but quality is also very important."}
{"text":"I was at KaKa sushi for a tasting event with girlfriends. Let's say that the restaurant has enough space at this location and even the interiors are pretty well made. I state that I am not a sushi lover but I was immediately struck by the balance of each course of our meal. We were literally submerged by so many different kind of dishes, some very original like the sushi pizza, and some pretty simple but with that touch that left someone like me pretty satisfied. The Chef we had that night did a great job. Let's see whether my second visit will be as good as the first one."}
{"text":"This was not my first time here. I feel like a lot the the hype has died down surrounding kaka sushi. It was impossible to get a reservation previously. It was fairly easy to get a reservation this time though. It was a weeknight and we were celebrating a birthday. We've signed up for their birthday coupon where if you bring 5 ppl to eat ayce sushi there the birthday person is free. It's a pretty decent coupon. I find that kaka usually runs a little more expensive so I probably wouldn't come unless they had that coupon.   WE have to thank kaka sushi for putting torched and pressed sushi on the map. I think kaka was the first restaurant to offer torched and pressed sushi at ayce locations. Now i feel like its pretty standard to have those at every ayce location.  My fav sushi is the pressed salmon sushi here. I I could probably eat 60 of those pieces alone."}
{"text":"They didn't have the ipads to order and it was difficult to flag someone down everytime to order. For some reason, I found the menu limited compared to the Markham location and when you order for example 20 pieces of salmon sashimi, they'll downsize and give you 5-6 pieces instead.   However, I am impressed with the service and quality. They were attentive and the food arrived in a timely manner."}
{"text":"I mean...it's ok. I like that you can make a reservation and that they actually offer sashimi on the dinner menu. Service was a bit slow and the server kept coming back to us to ask if we were still waiting on food- like is there no way for you to check that AS THE SERVER?   Sushi quality was a little better than average AYCE, but that's also reflected in the higher price point I think(?)- not sure since I'm not an AYCE expert.   The weekend specials were pretty good so that was a redeeming quality.  Salmon was fresh- tuna seemed less so.  Probably wouldn't come back for the $45 after tax and tip price point. I would rather go back to Saku sushi in Toronto (in my reviews- check it out!)."}
{"text":"I have been to the Markham KaKa location so I can compare these two locations. The menu is smaller than markham but the quality of food is a lot better. Fish was fresh and they don't stuffed their sushi with rice to make you full. I can also taste the vinegar in the rice compared to normal AYCE buffet. You can see they put in effort in making their food by pairing different fish with different sauce/ topping. their tataki are so good I didn't feel like I was eating at a buffet!   Yes, there is no iPad ordering but instead we got better service compared to normal AYCE, our waitress checks on us regularly and tentative when we have questions. One tip is even the menu is small, never feel afraid to ask! I was a bit upset about not having miso soup or seaweed salad since I always order those two in Japanese buffet. I asked my waitress and she smile and said she could make that happen even it's not on menu. So ask!   One downside is restaurant pretty small, so come earlier or make reservation ahead of time. I would come back if I am in the area again."}
{"text":"If you saw my latest Kaka review, you would know about the disappointing experience I had with the lunch bento boxes. But alas, I decided to give it another try with their lunch buffet options and well... I was fairly disappointed. Here's a breakdown of my full experience :   The menu itself is so much more limited than their dinner buffet. In comparison to other leading sushi buffets, Kaka has about 1/3 less things to offer, which does not reflect their price inflation. All the items were greasy and the desserts tasted old. Also, yes they do have special sushi rolls but they're all so drenched in sauce, or so abundant in rice that it made it difficult to eat. I actually laughed because if you look at their special rolls, half of them are the same but with a different sauce lol...  The entire Kaka system was flawed. I don't see how they can manage a sushi buffet with how they currently operate. Yes, they utilize iPads for orders, but your order doesn't get submitted until a waiter comes along to review what you want, and then they need to actually send it to the kitchen. I think that's just so inefficient and too many extra channels to go through like please just gimme my food :( I mean, it wouldn't have been that bad if it weren't for the slow and rude service. They were extremely understaffed and so just for my order to be sent, it would be hard to flag someone down. Then, I would see my sushi in the pass, but it's not for a while until it was actually sent. (Also I ordered a miso soup in the beginning and they gave it to me at the end when I got my ice cream.......wut)   Now, I've really had the full Kaka experience : lunch buffet, dinner buffet, and lunch bento box! My overall rating is : SO NOT WORTH THE HYPE!!! Please, all other sushi buffers are preferable in comparison to this one, even if they do offer some unique foods like the torched sushi. But honestly, it's not worth the bad service and limited selection."}
{"text":"I don't know if the restaurant has changed owners and/or management but we didn't have a good experience at Kaka Sushi.  We had an early dinner reservation. When we showed up we were told they were running late and couldn't seat us right away but that we needed to be finished by 6pm as they had another group after us. This was the first time it was mentioned to us that we needed to be done in such short time. We had less than 1.5 hours to order and complete our meal. It was a surprise as we never were told before of any time limit, though we always assumed like most AYCE sushi places it was 2 hours. Nonetheless, we accepted this and proceeded to sit at our table.   What really bothered us was constant and incessant reminder during our meal by more than one server. In fact we had three different servers remind us within a span of five minutes. In fact they even advised us of last call being 5:30, not for main dishes but dessert as well. Which meant ice cream would be sitting there for a while melting. It's one thing for servers to be a bit pushy it's an entirely different level when the manager is the one pushing them and in turn rushing us to be done.   What we don't understand is why they seated us in a section that had a reservation pushed against our time slot when an entire section beside us was empty save for one table for the entire time we were there. This is bad management of seating by attempting to maximize profits, making us feel like cattle being herded around.  Finally to top it off, we felt the quality of the food has gone down. There also seems to be less selection and level of freshness and taste isn't the same as before. We enjoyed going to this restaurant in the past but unfortunately after this last experience we won't be going back again."}
{"text":"Came back for a weekend lunch, $27. Still a fan of their food overall. Just one disappointment of their spring egg as it came as room temperature.  Their service has improved a lot since my last visit. The servers are more welcoming. The manager there, Irene, was very professional and friendly. She heard that we are celebrating a birthday and gave one person 10% off. It is just something nice that I would like to point out and thank them for doing so.  I will come back again whenever I feel like some sushi. To be honest, any other a la cart resto would cost more than $27 for the amount/quality of food."}
{"text":"This place is great but on the pricey side. Order from an electronic menu, the quality and service are excellent. They have torched sushi, special rolls, hand rolls, sashimi, grilled and fried selections. I love the torched salmon. It didn't get my 5 star rating because it only has 3 kinds of sashimi and didn't have my favorite yellowtail. But I understand it's about cost control and price competition. Highly recommend if you are looking king for AYCE sushi."}
{"text":"I tried to get a reservation for a random Monday night a few days in advance, but it was a no-go.  It's so insanely popular right now that booking at least a week in advance might be the only way you'll manage to nab a spot.  After finally getting here with my family (with a reservation made two weeks in advance), the first thing my mom said about our reservation was, \"KAKA? You want to eat KAKA? Seriously?!\"    Rest assured, Kaka is by name only.  Order your dishes via an iPad, where each item chosen is considered one piece per serving (ie: order 1 sushi and you will literally get one piece).  The dishes are more creative than most, like pressed box sushi and seared/torched sushi, with dessert offerings like lavender mousse or grilled conch on skewers.  These items sounded great when perusing the menu online, but were unfortunately unavailable on the date I was there, so I can only comment on the items that were available that night.   You might want to know that I think a freebie platter of premium sushi (things like raw scallop sushi) are given to each table as a newbie/new opening promo.  Great that you get these premium items for free, but on the downside that means you're getting a whole lot of rice with those pieces, guaranteed to fill you up quickly.  But hey, it's premium and free!  Quality is not bad for all you can eat.  The downside of Kaka is that I think a lot of it lies in the novelty of the dish items.  At the end of the day, you're still getting the same ingredients that you'd get at any AYCE, just in a slightly different format. IE: Pressed box sushi still tastes like sushi.  There are plenty of cooked items too though, so that's a plus to change up the tastes a bit.   For the moment, I'd say that although Kaka is a couple dollars more than the average AYCE, it's the best AYCE spot in the city for the variety.  I hope Kaka is able to keep up the quality and continues to do well!"}
{"text":"Alright- tried for the first time and went in with high expectations. iPad is annoying to order from because you need to flag a waiter down to confirm the order everytime. Slush machine was broken- disappointment. Waitresses were friendly.   Went on a weekday and menu selection was just average. Creme brûlée was good tho. 3 stars for the friendly service."}
{"text":"I am surprised how much worse the service and food quality have declined than just a couple weeks ago. No water refill, cooled beef ribs, the guy coming to remind us the \"1 hour and a half\" time limit while the last time the manager said she wants us to sit for a good 2 hours to enjoy the food. If you want us out early, deliver the frigging order that we made!"}
{"text":"If you ever come here without a reservation, have fun waiting in line. The food is great especially the torched sushi selection and the desserts. We use an iPad to order and there are pictures so you always know exactly what you'll be getting and food comes out almost instantly. The ambience is nice and the service is decent."}
{"text":"Probably average at best. Came in on a Saturday around 7:15 and we were quoted for an hour wait for a table. We decided to sit at the bar and were seated immediately. They brought out some house specials - baked scallops and some sashimi in a ponzu sauce(?). They didn't tell us it was the house special until we told them we didn't order this. We ordered a variety of sushi, rolls, sashimi and hot foods to start. One good thing was stuff came out real quick but other than that nothing really stood out. Their charred sushi and pressed sushi is not really comparable to places downtown like Jabistro. The sashimi was fresh but sliced quite thinly. The worst thing we're the rolls - sloppy and way too much rice. For 80 bucks for two people, you're much better off going to an a la carte in my opinion.  On a side note, their matcha creme brûlée has good flavours!"}
{"text":"I visited with my friends. We booked a table before going but arrived late due to traffic. Thankfully the server had saved a table for us, so we did not need to wait. Overall the food was alright. We got our food as soon as we ordered them. The servers were prompt, and we enjoyed our time overall. There were items on the menu that we could order only once per visit. I was surprised since it sort of defeats the purpose of coming to an AYCE restaurant. Two of my friends were turned off by it, so I got to eat all three . I think they were delicacies like fish eggs on rice and fish liver pate. They were delicious but nothing too spectacular (in my opinion) to warrant a once-per-person limit. Also, they gave us wrong orders on two occasions. Kaka has been on my list since the restaurant opened. I never had the chance to visit due to how crowded it was. Unfortunately, I am not inclined to go out of my way and make a second visit. Many other options in Toronto offer an experience that is comparable or even superior."}
{"text":"I've been on hold for 30mins for reservation. Nobody picks up the phone. What is the point of having a phone number if nobody is there to answer. Very very disappointed in customer service. I dont know if they have the best ayce sushi but this is not the way to treat potential customers!! You guys should start using open table if dont have a good phone system.  Wasted my time for nothing."}
{"text":"Not typical sushi AYCE.Quality (and yummy-ness) is great (including dessert). Lots of AYCE places, the dessert is dissapointing (too runny, too little, too bland, etc). But this place, both sushi and dessert get two thumbs up! They also have `special' on the weekend (i.e. Can only order once per customer and price is already part of AYCE). This is definitely nice `touch` to try the specials. If you go with a group, you get to try different `special' menu as your group order different special. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"First things first...making a reservation is quite ridiculous. You have to call quite in advanced in order to get a table for the time and date you want. Also the process of calling in to try and make said reservation can also be a bit of a nightmare.  This place is always very busy! It's a nice atmosphere and our server was quite friendly. She asked if we've been here before and since we haven't, she explained the ordering process to help us out. Some of the food came quite quickly, while others didn't. I read a lot of yelpers raving about the torched sushi. It's...Okay. It's not out of this world. The sashimi tasted very fresh though. They had a separate menu printed on a piece of paper which you can order limited things from. I enjoyed the different options they had.  To be honest, this place is quite expensive for all you can eat. I really don't feel that my experience and food was worth the amount I spent. I'd come here again if I were invited to an outing with friends but not of my own accord."}
{"text":"Vesta, you think you got it bad when you were put on hold for 15 minutes trying to get a hold of this ridiculous establishment?  I was testing my luck today and was put on hold for 30 minutes without anyone answering!!!!!  I almost forgot I was trying to call in for a dinner reservation and not calling Revenue Canada to enquire about my tax bill or something!!!  ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS!!!!!!  WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE BEFORE EVEN STEPPING FOOT INSIDE!!!  If they can't even pick up a phone call within reasonable time, I honestly question their entire establishments service quality and food quality!!  BEWARE!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Probably the best sushi place in the downtown core. So many options and the sashimi actually taste fresh. The only place that offers both surf calm and tako. I generally don't order makis but their chef special was bomb. I highly recommend the beef tataki, so bomb. Service was good and quick. Keep in mind, we went in when it wasn't busy. The price on the other hand it higher than most places but it's worth it for the quality of food. I'm not sure if the food tasted extra delicious cause I was high but I would definitely come back and try again sober."}
{"text":"They didn't give us our crème brulee. Fish was on rice and seared as advertised.. Where's my potatoes? Lots of selection and items not available elsewhere. We ordered 26 mango lychee slushie shots. Only 25 came."}
{"text":"Tried out Kaka for lunch. You order your food on a tablet and the servers bring the food to the table. Have to say the servers were very attentive and helpful with explaining how to use their system. It's a bit pricey but the sushi and sashimi is very fresh and a better quality compared to other AYCE. The stand outs here were the Grilled Salmon Belly, Tempura Shrimp and Age Dashi Eggplant, and Lamb Skewers spiced with Cumin. I was not a fan of the Deep Fried Scallops, thought there was too much batter. For And the mussels were too stringy. I love the miniature desserts, especially the Mango Slush, Lychee Pudding and Cream Brûlée.  The perfect way to end a meal. Overall, it was a good experience."}
{"text":"One of my favourite AYCE sushi restaurants. Food is fresh and delicious. Enjoyed some of there \"specialty\" items on the menu. Service is quick and polite. Overall, nice dining experience. A little bit on the pricy side but with the some of the special items they serve that other AYCE's don't, I find it worth the money."}
{"text":"This use to be my go to AYCE sushi spot. After my previous experience at KAKA, I can no longer say this is the case. The main reason I come here is for the torched and pressed sushi. The quality of the food has gone down hill over the past year and recently is worse than ever. The torched sushi is barely even torched, their apps are unavailable half the time, servers take forever to come to your table to send the order to the kitchen. Why provide me with an ipad if i need a server to send the order? Prices have gone up and they justify it by allowing you to order 1 of the bottom 2 items on the menu, but you're only allowed to order each twie but once and then twice all at the same time. Honestly, i had no idea what she was saying. I tried to order it and it turned out to be one of their signature roll... might i add, it was pretty embarrassing to be a signature roll. All in all, it use to be a great place but unfortunately this is no longer the case."}
{"text":"KaKa in Markham was my favourite all you can eat sushi place. Hopefully it didn't go down hill like the downtown location. Came here with expectations of matching or surpassing Markham but it was terrible. Food was not great. Selection seemed less than Markham offering. Just look at my picture of beef cubes. How lazy is that? Tiny cubes = over cooked. The best thing on the menu was the coke and even that wasn't free refills."}
{"text":"I swear I was here before but in Niagara Falls (Canadian side). I remember our big family of 16 went to this AYCE Japanese restaurant (Winds) and you ordered on Ipads and it was insanely busy...fast forward to the unfortunately named Kaka and BAM! Sunday night at 8pm (reservations made 3 weeks in advance) and it was B.U.S.Y. This one lady was giving a speech to a crowd saying we shouldn't be jealous if we see people go to their tables. There is a reservation sheet they go by. Intense!  I'm not sure what the big whoop about this place is, other than the ordering on the ipad. It's AYCE which means you get sushi (check), sashimi (check), fried tempura, noodles, rice, etc... They brought our table of 4 a Sunday special which was yummy (4 kinds of sushi)...we asked for another plate, and they said only 1 per table. Oh yeah, they have this \"torched\" sushi but again, so what.  All this to say though, GREAT PLACE for groups (and there were many there on Sunday night). It's AYCE and their dessert (chocolate crème in a cup) was super delicious. I had three of them! The Korean BBQ Ribs were sweet and sticky, and our table ordered 4 plates of yumminess.  Food is efficient! No sooner had we placed our order, the rolls came out pronto. Can't complain about the service...people bring food...people clear plates. Gets the job done.  It's next to Din Tai Fung so bonus for that - if you don't want to wait, head over there for some awesome and yummy xia long bao!"}
{"text":"Experience was good but the torched sushi could be torched a bit more (needs a stronger torched flavor). Service was very slow but they were understaffed. The staff were very sweet and extremely nice! Amazing service when they managed to get around to all the tables. The winning details that won the 4 star rating was  1) vanilla creme brûlée (so creamy and delicious) 2) albacore tuna (so buttery and rich) 3) tuna tartare (my friends thought it was so-so but I loved the combination with the onions and lemon) 4) overall presentation of the food was amazing 5) food came quickly when ordered"}
{"text":"Used to be my regular spot for ayce when they just opened. Now the price is going up but everything else is going down. Poor food selection, torched sushi fall apart and other foods taste decent. During our meal, we saw a woman from the kitchen went in front of the sushi bar and started yelling to her staffs in Chinese. I won't come back"}
{"text":"This was a nice change from the regular sushi restos I go to! Especially since I'm not in this area too often. I came here on a Sunday night around 9pm and it was still surprisingly busy! I guess I could take that as a good thing! Aaaaand they close at 11pm?! Whatttt that's awesome! I can't remember how many times I've wanted late night sushi only to find out that they all close at 9:30-10! It was nice being able to go in late but still have enough time to eat before they start making last calls!   Compared to other sushi restos, I felt like they didn't have as many items to choose from, I was pretty bummed with the dessert options too! No fried banana, fried milk pudding, mango yogurt?!?  but from the options they did have, it was all delish!!   They served some in house specials that were not on the menu like tuna and salmon sashimi, each in its own sauce. The salmon had a lemon-y sweet dressing while the tuna had a pepper-y savoury salty dressing, both sooo tasty! They also served grilled scallops (1 per person) covered with a corn chowder-like sauce   Let's take about the torched sushi....YUM! Flavours and ingredients are so fresh! It was perfectly made and melted in your mouth!   I would definitely come back. They have a nice variety of sushi that I wouldn't normally have where I live so I really enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"I came here as heard it was good and made reservations 3 days ahead, however many have warned me that the quality has gone down and you don't need a reservation.  Half of the tables were empty and no line up which tells me news the rumours are true. With all the AYCE sushi places in the city and GTA, this is by far one of the priciest with the least selection. Honestly there was so little to choose from considering the vast amount of grilled, special rolls, and tempura options others have.  The iPad menu was confusing. The picture of the rolls don't represent how many you get.  When you order you have to remember that some are by piece while others may come in pairs or three's. Why wouldn't you indicate how many come per order beside the picture if they are going to vary. Sashimi is by piece so if you want 12 pieces, you have to push the add button 12 times.  You also only get 1 tablet per table, and when you have a table of 5 people all waiting one by one this took away from the enjoyment.  Everything was small compared to the picture. No presentation.  Many things were not available and was really a disappointment. So many better places than this.  Adults are $32.99. For every category they offered, they give you about 30% less variety than most places. A disappointment for the price paid. This place won't last. People will go once for the novelty and never go back. For those who think this place was good clearly have not had good sushi. In reality sushi drowned in horrible sauces and  the portions were so small. I laughed as one reviewer commented on the chicken wings. I fully agree. They were so tiny, it was like eating frog or quail legs, I don't think we were eating chicken lol!"}
{"text":"Updated review - since my last visit, they have certainly made it a bit easier to make reservations.  Mind you, they only take reservations between 12pm to 6pm (unlucky for those who are trying to call in after work).  This at least allows my experience to be more enjoyable.  In their defense, once you have a reservation, your table in generally ready at the time reserved.    Orders are done via iPad, and the food comes very quickly once ordered.  I've tried both weekday and weekend, and you get a special plate of more 'exotic' sushi on a weekend, such as scallop sushi which is my favourite of the plate.    The torch sushi is the item that really shines here - it's easily the best stuff on the menu, the only downside is that it's a lot of rice to eat and can fill you up really quickly.    For dessert, there is certainly more variety than most other AYCE.  You have your usual green tea ice cream etc, but there is also green tea creme brulee and some other dessert with jasmine in it which is quite surprising.  The mango slush dessert is literally a tiny cup of mango slush, makes me want to order 10 of them and dump them into a bigger cup as a drink.    However, at about $40/pp, it really is quite a bit.  If possible, I would come here on a week night instead because the menu is virtually the same except for the exclusive week end plate of sushi mentioned earlier."}
{"text":"Quite a good place for AYCE, but take note that this is a restaurant selling Asian fusion. While the fish is fresh and tasty, don't expect a variety of fancy sashimi - instead, you'll find aburi (torched) sushi and pressed sushi.  When we went, Kaka was doing their featured special weekend menu. Each of us got to choose a dish we wanted. My dad and I got the monkfish liver, my mom ordered the Hokkaido scallop nigiri, and my sister got the salmon tartare with salmon roe. I was not a fan of the liver... It lacked all taste and was very much like spongey canned tuna. My sister thoroughly enjoyed her order, though she did complain that there was a bit too much rice.  My family has quite a small appetite, so we weren't really able to order the same scale of spread as everyone else. That said, we did find some noteworthy items: - Lamb skewers (small orders, but very fragrant of cumin) - Grilled shrimp skewers (a little oily, but the shrimp is super crispy, to the point where you can eat the shell!) - Pressed salmon sushi (there smoked fish flavour is a little overwhelming, but the flavours are delicious!) - Salmon belly (can't go wrong with this delicious piece of fatty goodness) - Vanilla crème brulee (tastes better than the green tea one... Maybe that's why the portions are smaller) - Mango lychee slush (so amazingly addicting!)  Some disappointments were: - Grilled squid (the sauce added on top was too sweet and overpowered the flavour) - Hand rolls (the rice to fish ratio was way overboard; there was too much rice) - Green tea crème brulee (interesting idea, but didn't quite deliver)  Overall, the servers were quite good with ensuring all orders were served. That said, we found them to be quite understaffed - they had to run around frantically. Some orders were missed (e.g., my salmon avocado hand roll, which was a massive portion when it arrived - had a huge chunk of rice with two big slices of avocado), but it was fine for the most part. Still found the place slightly pricey, but totally worth it for my Mom's birthday dinner!"}
{"text":"I was more than thrilled to come back here for a second time, but it most definitely will be my last.  Made a reso for 6 at 7pm and the person who took it down had failed to tell me that I'd have to be out by 9pm. If I had known that, I certainly would've preferred to come at a time where I wouldn't be rushed out. One waitress even had the audacity to tell us that the reso at 9pm was waiting on our table. Needless to say, the customer service was well below par.  I'd like to think that I have a reasonable amount of tolerance, but there's only so much you can take before your patience runs out. In the process of placing our first order, we were receiving multiple orders of food to our table that we couldn't have possibly ordered.. (not a single apology was issued, but then again it's an ayce sushi restaurant so what was I expecting). It just seems to be my luck, since I've experienced wrong food being delivered to my table on multiple occasions.  The food was good and I still had a great time with my friends, but everything else left a sour taste in my mouth. The one star is solely based on their beef torched sushi (absolutely divine!).  Anyways, I'm disappointed this experience didn't live up to my first time here and like I said before, I definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"What's the hype over this place?  I came in with expectations. Many people told me that they're the best AYCE around and the price is totally worth it. Our party of 5 arrived and was seated immediately and tea arrived shortly. They explained how to order with the iPad and the number of pieces that comes with which rolls. They told us that we have a 2 hour seating limit and half an hour before it over, they will come by and see if we want anything else. Service was great. Decor was modern.  Food was whatever. Kudos for trying to be creative and thinking outside the box but their food just suck. Their torched beef sushi had no beef flavours (as do many other flavourless sushi/rolls), they put so much rice in their aburi, sashimi were sliced so thinly, many of their items on their menu weren't available and it's not even because it was end of service (our reservation was for 6pm). For $30/pp I'd be better off going to an a la carte with better quality. We didn't leave full because it wasn't worth wasting prime real estate (our tummy) with this food.  I'm on the fence on coming back - they had so much potential!"}
{"text":"How to meet my needs for a Japanese AYCE restaurant:  1. Serve at least moderate quality food. 2. Bring me that moderate quality food really really quickly.  Kaka checks both boxes on that list for me.  I went with my family recently to Kaka in Markham. It was priced on the higher end of AYCE at $29 for an adult lunch on a weekend. They use the fancy schmancy iPad-based ordering systems which makes life so much easier than having to write stuff down, or to flag down a server. Food selection variety was good, and 95% of the food was something I would be satisfied with at a sit down non-AYCE Japanese restaurant. The only exception was the clearly still frozen salmon sashimi. This dropped my rating 0.5 stars.  Service was top notch. Everyone was friendly and brought food over real quick, which is exactly what you want when you're stuffing your face. No complaints whatsoever about service during the meal. However, as we neared the 1 hour mark, we were told that this was \"last call\" and that we had to leave. WTF? So if you're expecting to be able to sit and eat and eat and eat (which fatties like myself enjoy), then you're shit out of luck here. You're capped at an hour of gorging yourself. This dropped my rating another 0.5 stars.  All in all, I was pleased with the experience at Kaka. By the way, does anyone else find it a little weird that the restaurant's name, spelled differently but sounding the same, means shit in Spanish (ca ca)?"}
{"text":"Perfectly sized mango slush treats. Overly pricey in my opinion.  Food: 4/5 AYCE has good selection. Service: 4/5 Speedy and diligent. Environment: 4/5 Modern. Could use deep cleaning. Washrooms: 4/5 Clean. Worth it?: 2/5 Too pricey.  AYCE iPad ordering.  As far as AYCE sushi in the area goes, this place has a great selection. Quality is also better than most but I was disappointed by the pressed and torched sushi not being torched enough. Seems as if they just put it on the top rack of the oven. The highlight was definitely the mango slush. Tastes fresh and is a must try. I think they are sized perfectly to not take away from the rest of the meal.  You won't catch yourself having to ask for more tea as service is diligent and quick. Did not have an issue with missing items like some other AYCE sushi places. They do suffer from sushimi pieces counting error.  I would return if invited out but I won't be coming back  on my own accord. Experience was okay but is just too expensive for what you're getting in my opinion."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Food was meh, it was not filling and expensive. The taste, while decent, was not good enough to command such a premium price. Don't expect much from complimentary miso soup and salads -- it's awful."}
{"text":"Updating review to include KaKa's a la carte lunch menue.  My coworkers and I Love the new lunch menue!!  The torched set was too expensive previously and you can't get full from it.   These new bentos offer much better variety and value.  Thanks for offering these new combos, we will be visiting even more often from now on  :)"}
{"text":"I had the chance to enjoy a quick lunch here yesterday and I gotta say the hype is f'real. KAKA has managed to bring the refined elements of fine dining sushi to the masses at affordable prices while maintaining high quality levels.  On my visit yesterday I didn't get to experience the AYCE element as their lunch time is an a la carte selection. Normally this would disappoint me but I wasn't terribly hungry and felt that killing myself with what I normally eat at an AYCE might prove to be unwise for my afternoon of work ahead.  On my servers recommendation I went with the torched sushi set for about $17.99. The torched sushi is what KaKa is famous for so naturally I had to have this. It came with Miso soup, green salad, 3 pieces of torched red tuna, 3 pieces of torched salmon (with a spicy mayo and jalapeno slices) and 2 pieces of hamichi (sp?). Every piece was absolutely amazing, the fired sushi essentially melting on my tongue like butter. I was absolutely floored with this experience.  The venue is gorgeous and staff are extremely well spoken, friendly and helpful, so full marks all around for the total dining experience. This place should be 5 stars but I would like to return to experience their dinner time AYCE offerings before awarding that final coveted star. If it's anything like the a la carte options I'm sure they'd get 6 stars if such a thing existed!  Cannot wait to come back! Join me will you?  Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"It's quite pricey but worth trying at least once. The service is good since you can order via iPad. The only downside is once it's ordered you cannot unorder it. We did try their torch and pressed sushi, they are pretty unique but at an all you can eat, it really all taste just the same to me and I was just trying to stuff it all in.  I think I would come here again for a la cart to really appreciate it.  Other than that my family enjoyed the mango slush deserts a lot! We kept ordering and ordering. They come in mini shot glasses which was super small. We had to order 20. I think they should consider serving them as mango slush drinks in a cup. That would be great!!  I enjoyed their sashimi during lunch, it was fresh as well as the beef sashimi.  I was super hyped up about their desserts from all the Instagram posts, unfortunately I was a bit dissapointed. They did not have all their selection available. As wel I tried the mousses and the creme brûlées and it was nothing special.  It was actually my moms birthday. They gave us 10% off her meal. So we only got around $2 off. They said they would bring a birthday dessert platter but none came.  We even had to ask twice for the 10% off for her (yes of course I want my $2 off lol)"}
{"text":"So hyped up, but damn that was the WORST service I've received in a long time.   Seriously, the shitty service was on a whole new level, considering ayce. (Ironic, for all those trolls laughing at the 'kaka' name)  Pros:  - menu variety, certainly different from your usual joints  - blow-torched sushi!  - thick, quality sashimi cuts  - desserts; must try the ganache, matcha creme brulee, mango lychee slush, spring egg -lamb skewers  Cons: - super tiny and cramped - (almost non-existent) service  - we had dirty dishes on our table the whole night; as did all the tables around us - MANY forgotten items - dirty & chipped dinnerware - the already slipping in quality (at less than 6 months old establishment)  The food is better, than your average ayce sushi joint - it almost justifies the pretty buck you're paying.   DEFINITELY call ahead and book a reservation. Even on a Monday night, they were turning people away at the door. If you are a walk-in, you'll be told to try after 9.  However, mind you, last call is at 10:30, 8ish pm reservations have their '2 hour window' ending around 10; you're pretty much hoping someone finishes early.  They've only recently opened, and it's a shame that their standards have already started slipping. The fish on the pressed sushi was super thin, where you could only taste rice.  (Most) servers ignore all the dirty dishes piling up at every table. We spent our dinner playing tetris &  Jenga, trying to keep our stack from falling.  One of our desserts came in a shattered glass.. You could feel the cracks even on the inside. I can't imagine, if someone had actually gotten shards of glass in their mouth.  We were constantly reordering; in the midst of all the FORGOTTEN orders, we had items that were 'sold out', and no one bothered communicating to us until the third server we came across.   Would I be eager to come back? I don't think the torched sushi and desserts are enough to have me running back, knowing the service would make a terrible night."}
{"text":"TL;DR version: good but too much sauce on their special sushi and maki or anything fried. Service was standard, depends on which server. I'm down for spending money on food but if it's only decent food and it's this expensive, I'd rather go to a nicer place a la carte and spend the same amount.  Food: the hyped food was the torched sushi and pressed sushi. They were flavorful but the sauce on top was too much and would overpower the freshness of the fish. My auntie even commented that it looked like toothpaste on top of a toothbrush.   The beef sashimi was over seared so the sides were too tough. The butter fish came frozen. The tai was very good and cut nicely. Salmon was very fresh.  The ramen soup was too bland. Fried udon had too much sauce and the sauce was too sweet.  The hot foods kept coming cold. W ordered the grilled ribs twice and it came one piece less each time and was cold which made it feel extra oily.  Dessert: the cream brulee was good flavour wise but the caramelized sugar top was too thick and hard. The slush was the best one. Highly recommend ordering it like it's a drink.  Service: like any other ayce. Not particularly good but not bad. There was a male server who always seemed annoyed when we asked him to clear our table...but we weren't being demanding or rude, our table was just running out of room. We would also hand him the plates stacked so I see no reason to be particularly annoyed with us. Also when we asked for the bill, he saw we were paying by credit card, he just printed the bill and punched in the total and handed us the machine without showing us the bill. Even when we asked to see it he just said tip was not included...that's unprofessional. He should've let us see the bill regardless...  Orders: we're used to not having our order right at ayce places. We thought with the iPad ordering system it would be better but it wasn't. For example, we ordered 6 pieces of eel sushi for four people twice...only one order of four pieces came.  Overall, food was decent (3.5), service was moderate (2.5), atmosphere was good (4), seating was spacious (5), price was on the higher end (2), total 17/25."}
{"text":"Hands down my favourite AYCE sushi restaurant by far. I've been to multiple AYCE places around the GTA and including Waterloo but nothing satisfies my cravings more than Kaka. Firstly, their sushi is exceptionally fresh and tasty, which is a big bonus for an all you can eat. Just like JaBistro and Rice Cream (located in Waterloo) they have a selection of torched sushi, which is different from other AYCE restaurants. Honestly for an AYCE, all of their raw fish is fresh. If you're not a fan of raw fish, they also have a selection of other types of unique sushi that you could try! Not to mention the best part, they have a wide range of desserts, the mango lychee slush being my favourite. As for management, the staff is fairly friendly, and their service is relatively great. Although pricey, it is definitely worth it if you're stomach is willing to handle a lot of food! 10/10 would recommend. One helpful tip I can provide for you fellow Yelpers is coming right around their dinnertime, which starts at 4:30, especially if you didn't make a reservation because it DOES get packed."}
{"text":"Good all you can eat sushi. A little better than the rest. Like using notebook to order, very convenient. ."}
{"text":"I only want to give 2.5 stars to KAKA and it's only dedicated to their management team and employee . Good service and as you can see on Yelp the customer service / owner really cares about customer experience.  I admire this proper business attitude    However, as a restaurant  itself, It doesn't really provide good food even at a all you can eat level. The menu selection is very very limited and the rolls are not that good. Their BBQ skew doesn't taste as well.   They put too much sauce on food. It's Japanese food it should have it original flavour.   It's just an very very average all you can eat place. I hope they can improve their menu Put more sashimi on the menu put less heavy Sauce on your food.  I would only visit once."}
{"text":"Kaka opened about a year ago and I have been there a couple of times. When the restaurant first opened, the demand was so high that you had to reserve a week in advance to get a table. Now that the demand has come down, it has gotten a little better. I came here on a weekday dinner with a group of 8 friends.  First off, this restaurant is a Japanese AYCE. This is probably one of the priciest that I know of (29.99$+tax/tip) for a weekday!! My friend from out of town wanted to try it since she had never been. It has been probably 6 months since I last came here and boy, has everything changed.  The food quality of this place has gone extremely downhill. I would have given this place 4-5 stars for the previous experiences. However, this time, the food was significantly worse than I remember it. One of the biggest attractions is that they had torched sushi. When we got our plate of torched sushi, it felt like that the fish on top was just cooked, barely even torched. The cooked food was mediocre and the fried food had an off taste to it, almost as if the oil needs to be changed.  Another thing was the service. Our party sat down at 7:00 and you are allowed 2 hours to eat. The waitress said that our last order was 8:30! I couldn't believe it as if they were trying to kick us out early or something.  Given the above average price and the food/service, I would definitely think twice before coming back again."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a formerly Japanese restaurant but now changed into AYCE style. Quality of food was very high indeed for all you can eat place. Probably the Best I have tasted. If you know your food, you'll taste the materials they used.   Grand opened on Fri July 3rd. Friendly staffs, ipad orders; very cozy, clean and zen environment. This place is not too big, I called in for reservations just precautionary.   LOVE how all portions of the food come in small amounts so I get to taste more variety without being stuffed. Ordered lobster bisque- and it was just amazing. I had to re-order again because it was sooo good. Better than some \"self claimed\" seafood restaurants.   Ordered coq au vin which is originally a French dish- chicken braised with wine, lardons, mushrooms and garlic. They had some alternations, used carrots, onions and some peameal bacon or pork belly. The chicken thigh (see pic) was very tender, comes off the bone and the sauce was alright. Can't complain for an AYCE place tbh. Quite tasty.  Sashimi was fresh, fresh and very fresh for mine. Ordered a couple pieces a time to save food and looked like plating was more detailed. Sashimi was all thick cuts, I ordered salmon, BC tuna, beef tataki, and tai. (See pic) The salmon was fresh, and the freshness flavor of the fish oil lingered in my mouth for after taste. Quality for salmon I had was not from an ordinary AYCE restaurant.   Had an baked oyster and a baked mussel. Both same mayo sauce with tobiko and chopped shrimp. You can request to your server if you have any allergies. My partner was allergic to shrimp, so they made baked oysters with no shrimp for him. (I thought that was quite thoughtful and detailed minded to cater to your customers' needs)  Ordered some skewers- conch, lamb, ox tongue (thick cut), okra, oyster mushroom and chicken nankotsu (cartilage). All similar spice used, taste alright. Ox tongue was really good imo since it wasn't dry and it was thick cut. Okra was a bit over done for mine, it became a bit soft and soggy-ish.   Sushi- they have oshizushi which is sushi made by pressing into a box mold to create a perfect rectangles of sushi and add toppings or sometimes they have toppings in the middle of the sushi also. I'm not sure if they prepared using a traditional wooden box called \"oshibako\" though. But keep in mind, AYCE restaurant, it is a pretty good quality already. I ordered torched salmon and a tuna but tuna never came and I didn't bother to reorder. It was okay, I'm not a huge fan of oshizushi, but it's not bad at all. With pricing keeping in mind, it is a good deal to try here than some Japanese owned restaurants in downtown, Toronto.   Also ordered some special rolls- beef tataki roll (with torched beef sashmi on top, avocado and asparagus inside) and honey mustard shrimp roll (torched salmon on top, tempura shrimp, kani, tobiko and avocado inside) - I liked the honey mustard shrimp roll, very unique and tasty. Honey mustard created a kick to the torched salmon. Wasn't over powering with the mustard taste either. The tempura shrimp inside the sushi was very fresh.  Torched sushi: I tried all kinds they had. Very good quality for AYCE. The pricing is definitely worth coming. No complains. All very delicious, plating wasn't bad and very unique. The torched beef tataki sushi reminded me of the ones I had at Genki in Hong Kong. Very tender, sauce wasn't over powering the entire sushi taste. The beef was juicy. For all sushi I had, I did not use soy sauce or wasabi here because it's torched & I trusted the chef should be knowledgeable enough to present their art work the way they wanted me to taste.   Lastly UDON and ramen was the BEST I had at any given Chinese owned Japanese restaurant. And for AYCE? I couldn't believe it. What I taste, the quality compared to the price I paid seemed too good. Udon was Q (chewy) and the soup based was a clear broth, clean and delicious. ONE THING i need to mentioned is, they don't use frozen vegetables. IDK about you, but I hate frozen vegetables because they're hard and tasteless, dull and just horrible. The udon I ordered here used corn from a can (I supposed) because it was crunchy, and tasted like those peaches and cream corn. The ramen, I wouldn't complain, still very good. However, I guessed it was precooked and added soup into the bowl when customers ordered because my ramen was a bit hard (after it gets cold) so it became one pile. I'd prefer udon over ramen here if you still got some space in your tummy to try it!   Dessert- not something ordinary you see at an AYCE restaurant. I ordered earl grey mill ganache square and I can taste the earl grey and strong coco taste. I also ordered a lavender chocolate mousse, it was creamy like chocolate pudding and the hint of lavender in it. I love the couple pieces of chocolate rice krispies on top cause it changed the texture of the mushy yet smooth pudding . Something different.    WORTH A TRY."}
{"text":"Came here for the ayce lunch a few weeks ago. Service-quite disorganized, staff were all busy running around that they practically ignored new incoming guests Food- disappointing. The sushi rice was the worst part of it, it was all loose and dismantled the moment I picked it up. Soup udon seemed like it was flavoured with instant noodle packets followed by frozen corn and peas. I also recall the red bean ice cream being really oddly flavoured and nothing like its description. But at least the food came fast.  Personally, wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Food was okay, food choices are a little bit more unique compared to other all you can eat but wasn't the freshest or the tastiest. Atmosphere is nice, but unless I'm here to eat the atmosphere, I don't think I would come a second time."}
{"text":"Decided to try based on all the good reviews. Turned out to be very good, especially blow torch sushi - we had party of 4 and all of us liked it a lot. Other sushi was good too, but this kind we tried for a first time, and it has amazing combination of raw fish and seared smoke taste. To our surprise they brought one plate called  \"weekend special\" which we did not order, when we tried to correct them they said they bring it to every table. My initial thought was - why they would do it in AYCE place where you can order anything you want anyway. Since it had 4 kinds of blow torch sushi's we decided to try it anyway. It turned out to be amazing and we wanted to order more, and some choices (such as scallop blow torch sushi) were not on a menu, so we had to ask our server. They said that this special is one per table only, so we could not order it anymore.  The only kind of blow torch sushi I would not recommend - beef sushi, it was OK, but I would not call it real sushi.  Another important point - if you plan to visit this place during weekend evenings, between 5:30  and 9 pm,  book reservations at least three weeks in advance. Before 5 or after 9 you can come without reservation.  Lobster bisque - also liked a lot, it comes in very small pot, you may want to order 2 right away. Another highlight - garlic shrimps, they were amazing. We tried also pretty much every dessert selection and it was very good too.  Keep in mind, while pictures may show several sushi pieces, they bring exactly one piece of sushi or sashimi per order unit, so order appropriate number of units right away.   Small complaint - grilled squid took a lot of time to prepare, and they brought it together with dessert. However, it was amazing too, and that's why I think this restaurant still deserves 5 stars overall."}
{"text":"Food was quite mediocre. Not particularly great or memorable. You can tell things are a bit watered down on the flavour - tea, soy sauce or had a lack of flavour - cooked food. I would rather go somewhere else with this price.  Things on the positive side, wait staff was good and food was quick."}
{"text":"really good experience here. Food is great. The waitress is really friendly and helpful. Will hit this spot again some other day again ."}
{"text":"Food 3.5/5 (60% of final grade) The food itself was at par, with some regular Japanee AYCE offerings not available, but it was nice to see that there was some innovation with the dishes. There's a greentea creme brulee for dessert that is not presently offered at any of the Japanese AYCE I know of. It was so rich, so sweet, so worth it. To give you a slight idea of how much my friends and I enjoyed it, my lactose-intolerant friend risked suffering just to eat it. There were also other less impressive new dishes I recall not seeing on any other Japanese AYCE menu. However, where there is more, there is less, because their sashimi offering wasn't as complete as, say, Ten-Ichi. The sashimi that was served was also in smaller pieces (which is actually appreciated to taste the fish better). I recommend trying the white tuna-- it was particularly succulent and buttery,.   Ambiance 2.5/5 (10% of final grade) The regular hustle-bustle of a Japanese AYCE on a holiday with nothing that really popped out at me.  Service 3/5 (10% of final grade) My friends and I had to wait 30 minutes to be seated, because it was very busy, and all the other people had reservations! MAKE RESERVATIONS IF YOU ARE TO COME. Compared to other Japanese AYCEs, it felt that the servers were more attentive even though it was incredibly busy when I went. The actual ordering occurs through an iPad, but the servers were very on top of refilling the tea and the food came really quickly.  Cost 2.5/5 (10% of final grade) Regular price for a Japanese AYCE.  Brownie Points 3/5 (10% of final grade) Extra brownie points to the lady server who checked on our opinion of the food three whole times throughout the meal. Employee of the month!!  Final Grade = 64/100 = 3 Stars  TLDR:  Not a place I would go out of my way for, nor visit again very soon, but if you're looking for a not-fabulous-but-can't-go-wrong Japanese AYCE, I do recommend coming here."}
{"text":"The ratio of fish to rice is 1:9 (see attached photo). It wasn't like this before management changed, where the prices have gone up as well ($31.99 for dinner). For this price I expected decent quality, but they basically just give you a ton of rice. Tataki was tasteless. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"What happened Kaka? The first time I ate you (in Richmond Hill) you were aburi heaven. Today you became forgettable, typical AYCE. The criticisms are many but can be easily rectified if you just stuck to what gave you success early on. Otherwise, you are on borrowed time. I'm still scratching my head how quickly you became bad.  My friend and I came for the melt-the-mouth, just flame-torched oishi that had the fish still warm with a caramelized smokey flavour. That's what it used to be like. Now you've cut the fish into paper thin bits and replaced it with huge amounts of cold pre-pressed rice straight from the fridge. The aburi is either mass-produced before and seared for a millisecond because it is neither warm, melt-in-your-mouth or smoky anymore. I know you want to speed up the process but please don't pre-make them, use fresh rice, and give the torch another 15 seconds to do its work and meld the flavors together.   I still love the ebi (shrimp) oishi but again protein rationing is becoming a big thing here. Although you've raised your prices already, I don't mind paying another $5 if you stop skimping on all the good stuff. Rice is not what made you guys good.  At least the lines are way thinner now. But you guys know why."}
{"text":"The sushi selection is quite amazing, and they didn't miss any order which is always a plus. The only complain is really just the price and washroom cleaniness.   Oh you also need to reserve table if you are going for dinner after 5:30pm (even for weekdays)."}
{"text":"Curiously (unfortunately?) named \"kaka\", this place is anything but crap. At first you roll your eyes at yet another AYCE sushi joint but after dining here I happily roll my eyes back. If you make it through the cumbersome reservation system (they only pick up the phone between 12 to 6) you're in for one of the best ayce experiences. The techie in me loves how they give you an iPad to order and the foodie in me loves how everything tastes.  My favs are the torched sushi and oshizushi, but honestly everything is above average to great.  You order almost everything by the piece, which at first seemed ridiculous but then it makes it ideal for dates where you only want to sample everything, instead of trying to down 6 rice filled maki rolls. Even the customer service is above par; the waiters regularly check to make sure that orders are put through. Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"This is probably a solid 3.5 stars for me. I'm rounding up, though, because I was an American tourist here and the exchange rate made the price of dinner really good. So if you can get some sort of discount, even better.  To start, we went on a Friday night and this place was packed! We didn't have a reservation, but they still managed to squeeze us in near closing time. So, I definitely recommend getting a reservation if possible.   The service was all right. The host was efficient and nice, and the wait staff was all fine, but very detached and not personable. Again, though, it was extremely crowded, so I'm not surprised.  The food was actually pretty good. I liked the ordering system of just getting to use a tablet and order whatever you want. I also liked the small portions of stuff. I got to try a lot of the menu that way, and they didn't seem to mind multiple orders of the same thing at once, like I've seen at other AYCE places. I really liked the torched sushi, and the desserts.   In the middle of the meal, they brought us out a tray of 8 pieces of sushi for \"free\" (as in, we didn't order it, so it was sent by the house). It seemed like a weird thing for an all-you-can-eat place to do, but I guess the gesture was nice? It sort of threw off my eating because I had just placed a big order, though."}
{"text":"The service was pretty good when we went! They were mostly prompt and quick with our orders. They always kept refilling our waters and coming to our table. The food was also good for an AYCE place! Price is higher than other AYCE places but I think it's kinda worth it for the food selection (ie torched sushi, takati) and they also have desserts you wouldn't normally get at other AYCE sushi places (ie green tea creme brûlée). They also gave us a special roll (golden dust) that was superrrrrr delicious mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. Don't think this is on the menu though but you can try asking for it! Overall, would recommend :)"}
{"text":"Way overrated and a lot of items are unavailable when you try to order them. I've been to way better AYCE at lower prices and hassle free reservations. Would not go again."}
{"text":"Sushi here is so fresh and tasty! Their spicy roll are awesome. Customer service was great, no complains all around."}
{"text":"Very poor selection. I remember before going to Kaka they always had specials that we don't typically see at other AYCE which makes it unique but unfortunate now it's just your standard AYCE with high prices. Definitely not worth the price you pay. The food tastes very blend and dull. The crowd on a week night wasn't that many either. I remember before we had to call in at least a week to reserve. Seems like the quality has gone downhill completely. Would recommend Sushi Legend for those that wants AYCE Sushj"}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday for lunch. I found that the nigiri and aburi specialty rolls were not very special. The flavours were not unique. The foie gras one did not taste like foie gras, I don't think the foie gras was there. The sashimi was fresh but not any more fresh than other places I have been to.   I find their menu to be very small. The desserts were yummy and well portioned. The service was excellent. My water glass was always filled.   I don't think place is worth 35.99$/person. They are trying to seem high end but it is lacking. I would not go here again."}
{"text":"Wow. Highly recommended! Friendly service with great food! Beef tongue is tasty! Everything is perfect.  I don't know why I just come only once!!! For sure I will be back!"}
{"text":"For the price - $65 for two people for a weekend lunch, I don't think 1) it lived up to its hype and 2) it was as fresh as everyone claimed.  The two things that were great: - seared sushi and pressed sushi options - dessert options - caramel brulee  Not so outstanding: - service - speed of food to come out - the rolls - do not get these  We waited quite a bit for even our salads to come out and that was a little disappointing and obviously, not surprised that they would forget some of our orders at some points.   The rolls were the worst part of the meal and I basically felt like what I saw on the menu was GROSSLY misrepresented in reality. :( It was like false advertising or something! Anyways, that aside, aside from the pressed and seared sushi and dessert, everything else was just alright and not stellar.  For the price point, I'd rather just go somewhere else to have the pressed sushi and seared sushi......"}
{"text":"With so many Japanese AYCE around, this one is by far one of the best I've been.  Location/environment: Within First Markham Place, it has replaced where Sense Modern Japanese Cuisine used to be.  The interior has not changed when Sense first opened.  It's not a big restaurant, so be sure to take reservations in advance.  Cash/debit has a 10% discount - I went on a weekend, so it's $28.99/person.  Service: Everything is ordered via iPad (except for drinks).  Food came really fast because of this setup - we sent our first order and the entrees arrived within 2 minutes!  Our table was loaded with food - it came faster than we can finished them!  Very friendly staff and they are quick in responding to any questions/requests.    Food: Although they have what you would expect in a typical AYCE, but their food quality is really nice.  We received a complimentary platter of bluefin tuna, scallops and seared sushi which was very fresh and large in portions. The rice was also very soft and meshes into your mouth easily.  I like their salmon and the quality stays on par whether it's sashimi style, pressed sushi or blowtorch sushi.  You don't get a lot of places that does pressed sushi - so it's definitely worth a try!    As for the non-fish/sushi food, their skewers are amazing - with a similar setup as Zakkushi.  The soft-bone chicken was juicy and sweet.  Everything else was also enjoyable - soft poached eggs (try!), chicken drumsticks, lamb stew, grilled squid, cheese oysters (try!), cheese mussels, takoyaki balls, tempura (shrimp, zucchini, sweet potato), lobster bisque.  As for desserts, they don't serve ice-creams, but they have a wide selection of unique items like lavender chocolate mousse, cream brulee, mango or blueberry slush, chocolate custard and more."}
{"text":"I had a chance to visit Kaka's Markham store before. In comparison, the downtown location is well lit and easy to access! Food selection is some what different than Markham location. DT location seems to focus more on Aburi and Oshi Sushi!   My recommendation are of course their Oshi Sushi and Aburi! KaKa source works magic with Salmon! More selection of Sashimi as compared to uptown location (As I remember).   However, you have to write your own order in a piece of paper. I kinda liked the iPad idea utilized in Markham location.   One little finding is Miso soup was an hidden item! (Very surprised to not find it in the menu). But taste good!  PS: Very friendly stuff! Reception lady were very kind to accommodate us to change our reservation time."}
{"text":"Went here again. This time it's not full when we arrived though it eventually did. The issues in my initial visit like the dessert menu in iPad have been resolved.   Everything was so much better. The service was on point and servers would consistently check on you.  Food quality is spot on. Their special platter is serious business - high end aburi sushi like the hokkaido scallop, conch and snapper.  Love their ox toungue and lamb skewers! Very tender, flavourful and juicy. Can't get them in any other ayce place.  The mango slushie is so refreshing!! I actually order this from beginning to end since it's like a drink than a dessert.  This really has become my favorite ayce place. Wish it was closer to me!"}
{"text":"Maybe we were just lucky with our experience. My friends took me here for my birthday, it was a group of 6 and we were sat near the back of the restaurant.  The ordering was fairly straightforward, all the food came pretty quick and the service was nice. There were a couple items that were sold out but we weren't too bothered by it.  Because it was a fairly large group, we got to try everything on the menu, and for AYCE sushi, it's all pretty good. The only improvement I could see is changing the portion sizing for some of the dishes. For instance, when we ordered 1 dish of beef ribs, we got 2 tiny pieces lol which was ridiculous. But once we understood how that worked, we ordered 6 dishes the next round and got a regular portion.   I probably wouldn't go back unless it was for a special event because it's kinda pricey. But I didn't have such a negative experience as previous Yelpers and I went on a Saturday evening. Perhaps we were lucky or the restaurant finally worked out their glitches."}
{"text":"I'm surprised I haven't written a review about this place. I've been here a handful of times and each time left happy.   I forgot the name of the manager there but he's incredibly helpful! I remembered this each time I visited as he was very chatty and accommodating to my large parties.  The ordering system is really good but I removed one star because its hard to flag down someone if you needed something off the menu. Decor is great which is why I tend to host large parties here. Price is a bit pricey but its better than most AYCE I suppose  On one occasion my large party was ALL running late so I was sat there alone but the manager was really understanding and tried his best to help me figure it all out. The best part was a friend joined us much much later and took a seat. Most establishments may inquire if she will be eating or not etc but the manager came over and asked if we had someone new join - we looked at each other wondering oh great hes gonna wanna charge her but he said - no problem let me get you some tea!  Will be back!"}
{"text":"I had made a reservation 1.5 months in advance, however upon calling KAKA to confirm my reservation before heading there, I was told that my name was not on their system. The person (I assume was the manager) checked after I told her the date that I had made the reservation but still couldn't find my name. I was not pleased. However, after we spoke and she sensed two unhappy customers, she made a spot for us that night and said that we will still have a table for the time that we reserved. I commend KAKA for the good customer service.  Upon arriving, there was a huge line up, however we waited for a bit and were seated right away. The manager apologized for what had happened earlier and said she hopes we enjoy our meal that night. The tables were very close to the other tables but it was dinner time. We were also given an iPad for ordering.   We ordered the special sushi for the weekend and was very satisfied. The taste and freshness of the scallop and other fish was well done. The torched sushi was very good, however the rolls were ordinary. There were also items you don't usually see at ayce places like grilled quail, single boned chicken wing, and cold egg tofu. There were the desserts you usually get like mango yogurt and tiramisu, but they also had matcha creme brûlée and a mango lychee slush. The crème brûlée was very smooth and creamy and the mango lychee slush was refreshing.  The service was great and the staff all seemmed friendly. Given the higher price for ayce sushi, I would still come again for the good customer service and torched sushi."}
{"text":"Having been to the KaKa's Markham location a few times, this location downtown is a total disappointment and I definitely don't recommend trying - rather you trek further uptown to Highway 7 instead. From the decor and atmosphere to their food, it's not comparable with the uptown location.  Without reservation, I went on a Friday night as a party of two. Understanding there would be a wait, they advised it to be 30 mins to 1 hour. We ended up waiting for almost 1.5 hours while the area close to entrance had 4-5 two-seat tables empty that entire time! Good part is they had a waiting area (yet it's hidden in the middle of the restaurant where no one would know of). We were the first couple to be seated in that area and the other tables around us started to fill immediately after.  My first impression after sitting down was the lack of an electronic tablet experience compared to the Markham location when it comes to picking your food. Rather, they had already worn-out menus (and it's not like this location opened that long). I was also pissed because the stapling on the menu was done poorly, so one of them stuck out and cut my boyfriend's finger and skin. That was super dangerous and sharp!  Secondly, the tables in our area were uncomfortable - the chairs were like mini-stools, my feet couldn't touch the floor and by the end of our meal, my butt was getting numb and sore.  Thirdly, food items that we didn't order kept ending up on our table even after repeatedly advising them it wasn't ours, but instead our neighbours. They really need more communication and organization within the restaurant.  As for the variety of food and flavour, it does not compare at all to the Markham location - very limited and menu is somewhat different. When you see the sashimi fish selection vs. the sushi page selection, it's literally identical except one is with rice and the latter without. Nevertheless, there were more choices around the torched / pressed sushi (which they are also known for as an AYCE). Despite the larger choice, none of their sushi and rolls were delicious - all were average and not very flavourful. KaKa Markham had more specialty sushi and differences in their food.  Among all the items I've tried, my recommendation would be: the tempura shrimp (crispy and textured), all the sashimi (good portion and taste), squid sashimi and sushi - which not many AYCE restaurants serve, takoyaki (thin on the outside), and their creme brulee desserts.  I also have to call out there wasn't the onsen egg, while it was listed on the menu and not crossed out. And I tried one of their many tataki (seared and marinated raw fish), the Albacore Tuna Tataki. It had a weird aftertaste given the stronger fish aroma yet covered with ponzu sauce, it didn't go too well together.  The final disappointment I had was around desserts. So we ordered two matcha creme brulees and a KaKa ice cream special. After 20 mins we started to think something was wrong and flagged our waitress, whom said it was probably the kitchen being backlogged but need to check. Two minutes later, she came out informing us they ran out of matcha creme brulees and asked if we would take the vanilla brulee instead. Her service was good, but I'm pretty certain our order got missed or that there was poor communication between the kitchen and frontline staff, not even informing the customer.  Overall with everything that happened and the food variety/quality, this KaKa location is not worth the price for its meal and standard. We paid around $43/person after tips and tax ($34.99 before). I would rather visit another AYCE restaurant downtown and pay a cheaper price. The 2-stars is reasonable given their food is still average and edible, or else it would be lower."}
{"text":"Their selling point is blow torch sushi, but there's only three kinds, all of which taste purely like gas. Really bad service - we were being rushed to finish when we were 40 minutes into our meal from the time we were seated. Didn't expect much to begin with, but it's not worth the wait or the hype."}
{"text":"3.5  So this new restaurant at first Markham place has been open for a little over a month and I've been there twice since then.  Restaurant is really busy so go early or make a reservation.   The food is solid. I can appreciate the vinegared rice.  I like the spicy salmon, ika sushi, and tomago. My boyfriend really enjoys the skewers. I really like the blueberry cheesecake dessert and mango pudding. All their desserts are pretty good actually for ayce.   Servers are well trained and very attentive. Management works hard and very relational. I hope they keep this up.   Reason why I can't give it four stars is because I find the menu limiting. Not the largest menu for an ayce. I wonder if they will ever expand their menu cause that'd be nice. Menu also lacks continuity. There's lobster bisque soup and some other French dishes.   Anyway it's a solid restaurant. On weekends, they give 4 special torched sushi. Scallop is the best.   Oh yah. Parking sucks at fmp."}
{"text":"This place is average, run by Chinese staff and is extremely similar to Kiku in terms of food, price and atmosphere. Now I must admit I am a guzzler, standing at 5'10' 195lbs. However, I didn't expect to get kicked out after 2 hours when the restaurant still had seats available to other patrons. How it happened you ask? Waitress came by my table and TOLD me it was my last call/order. After having downed my 30th rib, I gave in and left. All in all, place is average and if you're a guzzler like me, you might want to order a lot of food upfront to save yourself a headache like me."}
{"text":"The reason I heard about this place was because it was featured on instagram (I think it was BlogTO). I usually like to try places that they feature because they do not disappoint. However, this place was overhyped. The location is in a plaza in Markham and it gets very busy. It was difficult to find parking. I went for lunch time which I believe is $30 (which is pricey for AYCE lunchtime). Their menu is on an iPad which you are able to chose your food. I like that they have a variety of food, but for the price and quality of the food, $30 is not worth it. The interior decorations of the restaurant is really nice. The service was good as they brought everything out and at a decent time. I would give it a 4 star if the pricing was more affordable."}
{"text":"The restaurant is overpriced, they charged us CAD 29 per person plus tax plus tips for weekday dinner, while providing very limited selection of sashimi, touched sushi and other foods. Quite amount of items on the menu are unavailable. I believe they changed the menu after getting their name popular, just like all the other AYCE Japanese restaurants."}
{"text":"salmon aburi is not good, was quite disappointed considering there was so much hype about the location up north. had higher expectations and would likely not return"}
{"text":"This place used to be my go to restaurant for sushi during lunch time. However, this place has been rebranded and new management. Reopened couple of days ago and it good great. The restaurant is under staffed, apparently.. staffs are brought in from another location and they don't seem to know where things ago. Take out order took more than 20 mins for the food and it was cold. Employees can't follow instructions either."}
{"text":"OK here is the deal.  i heard some many great thing about this place, i waited several minutes to get someone on the phone to make a reservation.  we heard that a reservation is needed to get seats.  so i did.  i called a week earlier and we got seats for a week later.  so i 'm all excited and hyped up.  the first plate that we ALL get is the chef's special plate.  it was alright.....  it had this SAUCE.....i can't put my finger on it.  sure, everybody is raving about torched SALMON / TUNE / BEEF sushi. you know what, not worth the drive all the way up there.  it was meh. again, the SAUCE.... what is up with sauce.   the ordering system is by iPad, which is pretty cool but i wish there was an option for NO SAUCE or ONLY SALT and PEPPER only.  the best item that we ate was the BEEF TATAKI. this was good!!! the usual AYCE place that we go to doesn't have this so it was nice to have this.  our bill, on the weekend came to be $80 for two plus tip. the TUNA SUSHI was unavailable that night.  if you eat that tuna sushi, it's worth $80, but not able to eat it.....waste of time and money.  they should of automatically took a couple of dollars off for not having certain items on the menu.  service.... meh. price....... too much location... not worth the ride (from downtown TO) food.........meh. pretty much everything meh...... (except the BEEF TATAKI)  will not go back...the hype is too much for this place. again....the SAUACE....too much of it.  there are much better places for AYCE sushi.  ?????4/10"}
{"text":"The food was great! The service was mediocre. A few items we ordered were wrong or straight up didn't show up. I'll definitely go back again though. The food was fresh and pretty good quality for AYCE."}
{"text":"Seriously eat here. The fish is so fresh and they have the most unique selection and premium selection.    They are marketed as AYCE (35$/person for dinner) but they do have a à la carte menu if you're not as hungry or spendy (rolls ranging from 5$ up).   We got the spicy salmon maki, black dragon roll, and the torched and pressed bento box. They started both of us with a salad and miso soup before bringing in the mains.   The salmon came first and it was seriously so fresh and delicious. I am not usually a fan of raw fish since it's usually hit or miss, and this was definitely a hit. No fishy smell or taste, just a beautiful texture that melts in your mouth. Next the black dragon roll came in all it's glory, a staple when go for sushi. I loved how it did not fall apart on the chop sticks and the eel was perfectly cooked. The torched and pressed bento came with fried zucchini, tempura, and orange slices. The torched had a beautiful smoky flavour and the pressed was so cool the see the fresh fish pressed between the rice.   Since it was opening week, we received desserts on the house. We had the lychee Pana cotta and the matcha crème brûlée. The lychee was more subtle flavour and the match was more bold, both not too sweet.   The cocktail list had very interesting drinks, though the original ones we wanted was not in stock yet (since they juuuuuust opened). Our waitress recommended the Ume Chic which had sake and plum liqueur and it was delicious.   7/7 would recommend if craving sushi in the area"}
{"text":"Was just ok but not worth the hype. Torched sushi was good but not spectacular. In general, the good stuff was only one serving per person and not AYCE. Service was chaotic as orders were mixed up and our server actually took my my full cup of sake and I had to take it back off her tray, albeit she did admit she was new. Not worth the  $32.99 price tag and one month prior reservation that could only be booked by walking in as they don't answer the phone."}
{"text":"No more tuna and oyster, but the price keeps increasing. Half of the space is empty during the lunch hour on weekends"}
{"text":"The first thing you notice when you walk into KaKa is the modern, upscale décor. It looks nothing like a traditional AYCE joint (i'm looking at you Aji Sai). There is a beautiful wall of sake barrels as you enter; and in the back of the room is a sushi bar with 10 person seating, offering a live view of the chefs at work.   Kaka is very busy. It's not unusual to call for reservations and not get a date up to two weeks away. I wouldn't recommend walk-ins either, especially on weekends, and if you do, be prepared to eat at Ding Tai Fung instead, as wait times can be up to 4 hours.  KaKa's big sell is that they aim to provide a premium AYCE experience, and on that, they deliver. Expect to find top notch, quality menu items that you don't normally find at a Japanese AYCE buffets. Make no mistake , this is no Sushi Kaji, or even Kura Sushi (for those of you who have been to Japan), but KaKa definitely stands out in the GTA as far as AYCE goes. Two of their exclusive items are the Aburi style (blowtorched) sushi and Oshi (box/pressed) sushi. We ordered multiples of the aburi salmon, B.C. tuna, beef tataki and the shrimp oshizushi. All of these arrived to the table with excellent presentation, adorned with little (but not overwhelming) garnishes. The shrimp oshizushi in particular was delicious and very close to aburi ebi sushi I've had in AYCEs in Japan. Sadly, there are only three kinds of torched and box sushi, but I recommend you try them all. We also ordered several rounds of tempura, gyoza, kalbi, lamb skewers, sashimi and baked oysters. It was all pretty good. At some point during our dinner, we even had a plate of Chef Specials containing four kinds of sushi (hamachi, conch, scallop, tuna) brought to our table. The dessert menu is also atypical, and has so much more to offer than the usual freezer burned green tea ice cream. I tried the mango lychee slush (which was delicious) and only wish I had room for the earl grey milk ganache squares and the lavender chocolate Pots.  All in all, I like this place and would definitely come back. I've noticed that the reviews for Kaka are somewhat mixed, but I would recommend people give this place a second try if your first experience wasn't perfect. I would also suggest to stay away from the typical AYCE offerings (you can get those anywhere for less) and fill your belly with aburisushi!"}
{"text":"For anyone that has been to the Markham Kaka, be warned, you are NOT going to like this location. A lot of the other reviews on here complain about the long wait times and the fact that there is no iPad ordering system. The wait times at the Markham location are really no different, and can be long and painful without reservations, especially on weekends. I don't miss the iPads either, as the paper ordering system seems to work just fine. The real trouble with the downtown location is that the sushi is just not that good. The presentation is lazy and haphazard and looks to be thrown together hastily without much care. Several of garnishes had fallen off of the sushi and onto the too-large plates and that's how they were served to us. More importantly, Once we tasted the food it was very clear that the quality of the sushi was mediocre at best; more akin to a run-of-the-mill AYCE rather than the quality we had come to know from the Markham location. Even the torching on the aburi sushi (which has always been Kaka's star feature and selling point) was lazy and negligible. Lastly, like many of the other reviewers on here, I will also agree that items from your orders do often get left out or missed, and given my overall experience, I have some concerns that it might be done  intentionally.   It has been a while since I've visited the Markham location, so I don't know if they have kept up with their quality. I won't recommend to readers to trek it to Markham as that it may not be feasible for everyone. However, if you are able you should give the original location a try for yourself and see the difference. My suggestion otherwise is to take a trip to Taro's Fish on Sheppard Ave. instead. While Taro's is not AYCE, you will love every bite for the same price."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my family for Christmas dinner.   The Good: - Ordering food on the iPad and having it come quickly. In fact, the food came too quickly. My suggestion is to order about 10 items, and then wait a bit before ordering some more. We ran into situation where we had put in 30 items on order and they all came at around the same time - There were no mis-orders (serving something we didn't order, not serving something we did order) that are common to many AYCE sushi places. - Torched sushi and pressed sushi are definitely worth a try  The Bad: - On a busy weekend, expect line-ups even if you booked in advance"}
{"text":"With all the AYCE sushi places it is nice to find one that stands out from the rest. Unique dishes not found anywhere and torched sushi which is rare here. The service is excellent with an iPad ordering system. Make sure you make reservations because this place is super busy."}
{"text":"I've been here about a dozen times since the beginning of the year. These guys are generally very good with their food and service, but tonight's experience completely destroyed any positive impression I've had of this place.   First off, we arrived at 9:15. There were a couple of seats waiting to be cleaned, and seeing as how they were busy, it was understandable that we needed to wait a bit. We are finally seated at around 9:40 and given our menu. We quickly ordered the food because their last call was supposed to be at 10:30. Food came but it tasted a little stale, like it was left out in room temperature for a while, but that's alright, I don't have too much expectation for AYCE. The waitresses that served tonight felt they were too good to walk around the table to drop off the food, and repeatedly handed us food over the barrier. Their service wasn't always like this, so this was a slight disappointment.   Here's the annoying part. At 10:20 we were told it was last call and we should hurry up. Alright, rude. But we ordered or desserts and handed back the iPad. The final round of desserts came at 10:45, leaving us with 15 minutes to eat before they close. The staff tonight were apparently very impatient and wanted to close early, so they rushed everyone to pay the bill. No problem. We understand you would want to go home early if it was possible. But the real issue tonight was the attitude of the staff. The waitress that looked like she was in her mid twenties came up to my table and told me to pay, brought up the machine, and I paid. As I finish up my last couple of ice cream, she comes up with horrendous English and tells me I am going to pay an extra $10 for the scraps on the plate. Are you kidding me? Those were scraps from bones and melted ice cream.  Overall, this has been the poorest, most embarrassing AYCE I've been to in 2016. Whatever positive qualities you've experienced in the past is no longer there. The food became unbearably disgusting, they miss orders, and the waitresses have terrible manners. Looks like we won't be visiting this place again."}
{"text":"First time here and ur was pretty good. The torched salmon was spot on and had a melt in your mouth texture. They also have good selection of good cooked food like the gyoza, fried tentacles if you're not big on sashimi.   Overall everything was well made. Better than any other AYCE place. Only The skewers were lacking some flavour. The mango slush is really good too."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try Kaka since I've heard so many good things about the Markham location. However, everything went downhill as soon as we arrived for lunch. First off, there's no iPad ordering. You have to wait until a server stops by with their own iPad to take your order (literally the worst ordering system you can have for an AYCE style restaurant). This meant a lot of waiting since there was only 1 or 2 of them working the entire restaurant (which was about 80% full). We arrived at noon and an hour later, we were still starving. Food came out at an abysmally slow pace. By 1 PM, we got 5 or 6 dishes of the 15 we ordered. In total, of the 22 items we ordered, 9 never showed up. We put in our orders (4-5 items each time) 5 times and started to make bets about what would come out and which one they'd miss. We were also given wrong dishes as well.   It came to around $72 for two people but what was crazy was that the menu is also quite misleading. There are some items (such as the duck) that are not available for lunch, only dinner. However, you're still being charged the SAME PRICE regardless of when you go! Most places have a cheaper lunch menu since they don't offer everything, but Kaka is charging you full price regardless. The menu doesn't note which items are \"dinner only,\" and it was only after ordering the duck twice that the server finally went to ask the kitchen and was told it's not available for lunch. Some items were also not available, such as the sushi pizza and the Kaka ice cream. You're paying full priced for a stripped down menu.  Overall, the food ranges from decent to great, but it's so not worth the waiting, ordering issues, and being charged full price for a limited menu. Save your money and go elsewhere - there's no shortage of solid AYCE options in Toronto. Sadly after two hours, we left frustrated and still hungry.  P.S. Once you order dessert, they consider it \"final call\" and you won't be able to order anything else. This system is a bit strange and nonsensical, especially if you're with others and only one person wants dessert."}
{"text":"An in impromptu visit to this restaurant...did NOT have reservations for dinner and were accommodated quite quickly. We went right when it was open for their dinner time service which started at 1630hrs. When seated they did stress that since we didn't have reservations what we did need to vacate our seats by 1800hrs. Upon first glance, the restaurant is quite tastefully decorated. It is a small restaurant with limited seating and reservations is definitely a must if you plan to go. There are a couple seats at the sushi bar as well if you wanna see the \"action\" of the chefs. As far as AYCE sushi, this is quite a different experience in terms of the offerings provided. Ordering from a tablet, the orders are quite accurate and fast. Service is attentive and cleans up the table quickly. We came for pressed & torched sushi and did NOT disappoint. Easily recommend this place and will be coming back in the near future!"}
{"text":"Decided to give this new ayce Japanese restaurant a try after seeing that it offers torched sushi. Came here on a Sunday night at 9:30pm, got seated pretty quickly since it was getting late already and not much people. The torched sushi and pressed sushi were good but the rice was not pressed hard enough so it keeps falling apart. Sashimi were fresh and good. Tried the lobster bisque and did not find it that special other than it being a bit salty. Waiters were nice but could be trained better in terms of quantity of pieces of different items. Bill came up to $35 after tips & tax, overall not bad since I mainly came here for the torched sushi and sashimi. Cooked food were alright, but large variety of desserts. Probably would come back next time."}
{"text":"Always full as they offer torched and pressed sushi for ayce. Has a good variety of sushi but a lot of their item are only available for weekends and stuff runs out quick! On the pricy side especially if food item runs out!"}
{"text":"All types of sushi, fresh materials, wide range of choices. Nice service. Recommend surf clam and half baked sushi."}
{"text":"I've now been here twice and the first time I came here, it was for the AYCE dinner and I thought it was fantastic. There was great selection, everything tasted beautiful and because I had made reservations, I didn't have to wait either. Making reservations is probably a good idea since this place is always live and bustling.   My lunch AYCE experience was still good but not as great as my dinner experience. I'm pretty sure they're afraid of using a torch here as everything that was supposed to be torched like the pressed sushi and the creme brûlée was definitely just cooked on the top rack of a toaster oven. Other than that, I still think the food is fantastic and it's nice to see that there's a sashimi selection for lunch as most places only serve sashimi for dinner. However, just take note that if you order 8 pieces of salmon sashimi you might only get 4 -- not that it's a big deal because you can always order more but there were several times when we got less than we ordered which was kind of funny.   Would I come back? Absolutely! However it is a little on the pricier side but the quality is good so it's definitely worth the splurge. Oh and get the mango lychee Slush (it's in the dessert section) -- it's SOOO good."}
{"text":"The quality of food is not as good as before when it first started. The choices of food also is not as much...ESPECIALLY the dessert section. With the decrease is both choices and quality....and for the same price....it does not make me want to go again."}
{"text":"I actually booked a table 1 month in advance even though we ate on a Monday. I read somewhere online that the place is always packed so it's better to be on the safe side...even if it's super early lols. Because this is an AYCE restaurant I will summarize my visit into the good and bad. Let's keep it simple.  Pros: - Pretty good service for an AYCE restaurant (i.e. checked on us a few times, gave us 10% discount for birthday, and provided extra napkins without asking) - Good variety - Tablet for ordering which is good because you can see the photos - Comfortable seating - Food is served immediately - Very few items were missed (this happens a lot in other restaurants)  Cons: - Pricey - Tables are wobbly LOL - The teapot is big (which is good because we don't need to do as much refills) but the tea gets cold near the end - The dessert spoon doesn't fit into their tiny glass jars LOL (if you try to eat the pudding, you actually can't get to the bottom of it)  I want to point out that this restaurant specializes in making delicious sushi (how ironic) but most AYCE restaurants cannot pump out quality sushi that quickly. I love the torched sushi - this is something I will come back for. I think their grilled dishes are average at best but I generally think this restaurant has good service which trumps a lot of other places."}
{"text":"REVIEW UPDATED: 02-01-16 I was very surprised someone picked up the phone after holding for 5 minutes. I made the reservation approx. 2 weeks in advance for a Friday night. There was only 5pm, 8pm or 9pm available for a group of 4. Chose the 8pm time slot. When our group arrived, there was no host to greet us, but a server came to greet us after a few minutes and took us to our corner table.   FOOD: We were given one iPad to order and the food came quick! We were also given a plate of special sushi that was not on the menu not too long after we sat down. This plate of sushi was very delicious - it included hotate, conch, unagi and a white fish sushi. Each kind had their own flavouring. My favourite was the hotate sushi, super fresh and sweet. We ordered rolls, sashimi, cooked foods, desserts AND the highly anticipated torched sushi. Everything was small in size which works out great so you can try a bit of everything. For example one order of the following you get: 2 pieces for a roll, 1 piece for sashimi, 1 piece for okra, 1/2 piece for chicken wing, 1 piece for gyoza, 1 single serving bowl for udon soup. You just have to place more than one order to get more pieces! This also helps control food waste. The torched sushi was decent, not extraordinary because it is literally torched sushi, it's just something you don't see at AYCE. Lots of desserts to choose from. Since I'm a tea fanatic, I loved all the tea flavoured desserts. Creme brulee had matcha and jasmine flavours. The chocolate ganache was an earl grey flavour. Overall, the food was fresh, delicious, and there were some creative rolls. Food is 4 to 5 stars, it's impressive for AYCE.  SERVICE: We lucked out with great service. It wasn't too busy the night we went for some reason. The server checked on us, we had our tables cleared very often. No missed orders. They just need a dedicated host to greet you.   PRICE: The pricing is a bit on the high end. $31.99 per person, does not include tax and tip. So pricing is a 3 star.   DECOR:  Modern, zen style decor. Seemed clean, did not feel grimy like a lot of AYCE places.   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We were very excited to try Kaka but unfortunately never had the opportunity to do so, due to its poor reservation system. If it was just for two people we would do a walk in, but we have a group of 8. You can only call between 12pm-6pm for reservations, but no one ever picks up and you're on hold for 30 minutes and more. I messaged Kaka through Facebook and they said they were experiencing high traffic because of the holidays and told me to wait longer on the phone. No customer wants to be put on hold for 30 minutes + and that may not even guarantee availability. Kaka should just remove reservations in general and only allow walk ins. By telling customers to call between 12-6 and making them wait for more than 30+min is misleading and poor customer service. They say \"they are constantly thinking of ways trying to improve this,\" however nothing has changed because reviewers have been saying the same thing more than 3 months ago."}
{"text":"Finally made it here! Man, this is one popular and busy spot right now, and you either have to come after 9pm, or make a reservation weeks in advance!  Came on a Wednesday night, and called about 5 days prior to make a reservation. Even then, there was nothing before 9pm. They are apparently booked solid for the next 4 weeks between 6-9pm! Absolutely crazy!  With all that in mind, I was expecting to be blown away! In the end, there were some good parts, but definitely wasn't blown away...  Came with one other, and our table was your typical 2 person, tiny table. Seats were quite comfortable, and ambiance was quite nice. You were given an iPad, and allowed to order away! I was pretty hungry, so I made the mistake of ordering too much on round one! Couldn't even fit it all on the table!  Some highlights were definitely the Torched Sushi (especially the salmon), the Beef Sashimi, and their array of desserts! Other than that, most of the items on the menu were quite similar to what other AYCE restaurants had.   Service wasn't all that great, as it just felt like a lot of flies buzzing around the table. It was just too busy in the restaurant. We needed to ask for more water more than once (and they gave us a jug, where he poured about 3 seconds into 1 cup and just put it down), servers essentially just hastily put dishes on the table, and most servers walked by without taking empty plates. I even asked if there was any way to get some plain udon as it wasn't on the menu, but the server just said no. No explanation. (I'm pretty sure you can make plain udon when you have udon on the menu...).   Overall a decent experience, but for $24.99 on a weekday, it really is a bit too pricey for a couple of good and unique dishes that you can't get elsewhere. If you do plan on going, just make sure you make a reservation, however much in advance is needed, or wait like 30+ minutes for a table."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved my experience at Kaka. It was Sunday dinner, there were 6 of us. Reservations were made about a month in advance. Anita was our waitress- she was so nice and helpful. Favourite appetizer: Karaage. Favourite roll: Green dragon roll. Favourite dessert: Green tea Creme Brule. I'll be back for this AYCE sushi for sure!"}
{"text":"Christmas brunch! And sushi of course!  We were late for the reservation, but the manager comforted us nicely and arranged a table after 20 minutes.   The sushis were yum! The rice was moist and sticky, which was very much my type. They serve the same menu with a lot of variety for both lunch and dinner, so there's no difference whether you go for lunch or dinner.  The torched sushi was really good, so was the pressed sushi and yam roll (no doubt!). Their special items were tasty too.   Service was nice and quick, we just made the order then they started serving after one minute.  Will definitely go for another time."}
{"text":"Going into this, I'm going to say that this will be a fun review to write. Here's why.  The place opened only four or five weeks before writing this review. I'm glad to report that for an all you can eat restaurant, the food was pretty much the best I've found in the city. That's saying a lot and they have dethroned my favourite Sushi place up near Yonge & Eg.   As an AYCE Sushi place, I'd like to give them a 5-star rating but they are experiencing some growing pains. For the time being, they are understaffed and thus the service is slow. When we arrived, there were only 4 or 5 tables of customers, out of many many more, and it still took 20+ minutes before we got to place our first order.   As I understand, they are also having difficulty setting up their iPad ordering system so that will take a few more weeks to get in place. Once that's done, our first \"problem\" will be resolved.  I would say that their staff are also fairly inexperienced because we never had our water/tea refilled without requesting it and even then, it took 10-15 minutes after several requests to make it happen. With all of these \"complaints,\" I can't give too much of a hit on this review because I'm confident that they will be resolved over time.   On the way out, the manager spoke to us and asked for feedback on how they can improve so I'm sure the place is in good hands from a management perspective.  The price is also a bit high compared to the competition BUT that increased price is reflected in the significantly higher quality and selection of food. Their dessert menu is shockingly diverse and interesting compared to any other AYCE sushi place in the city!  KaKa, you've won my loyalty and you will see me return again several times as we wander through the year.  Congrats!"}
{"text":"After hearing about all the reviews, I decided to finally try it myself. Came here on Monday for dinner for 2.  First is the call for reservations. Have hearing about one yelper let it ring for 30 minutes, I wanted to see. My call lasted 8 minutes before they decided to pick up.  As for the food: - Lobster bisque: wasn't warm, and even slightly cool. The shrimp inside the bisque was also cool.  Come on, soup should be warm or hot. Taste was meh. 4/10. - The torched sushi: somehow from the yelp pics, I was under the impression that there would be a lot of variety. But there seems to be only torched salmon, tuna, and beef sushi. I guess weekend dinners have more selections. The first 2 orders didn't have a lot of torched taste. The third one was warm and had a good torched taste. 8/10 - Pressed sushi was okay. Also 3 kinds--Salmon, tuna, and shrimp. 7/10. - Salmon sushi, ika sushi, masago sushi, and saba sushi were good. 7/10. - All the sushi had excellent fish to rice ratio. It's worthy of mentioning because some places give huge rice with little fish. - Salmon sashimi was not that good. Pieces were a bit thick. Tuna sashimi didn't completely defrost yet. 5/10. - Baked oyster and mussel were good. Nice and hot. 8/10. - Shrimp tempura: was ok, but the sauce didn't come together with the tempura. I was thinking \"is the sauce really coming? forget it I'm gonna have a shrimp first.\" Then sauce came after we had 2 shrimps. 7/10. - Lamb and quail skewr were ok. 7/10. - Beef ribs were good, but one or two were like 90-95% fat and 5-10% meat. 8/10. - Creme brulee was decent. 7/10. - Lamb in mashed potatoes was excellent. Nice and hot. 9/10. - Mango slush was good. I ordered 8 of those things (more on why right below). 8/10  Service: - Food came relatively quick for a roughly 75% full house. - Not really related to service, but the restaurant was kinda hot. Mom was a bit hot too, but not like me. I sweat a lot (but I tend to sweat easily). That's why I ordered so many mango slushes lol.  Cleanliness -  A few turn offs: - First, when I was handed the ipad as the server explained the menu, the ipad had a piece of rice with a piece of fish roe on it. All the time she was talking, I was just looking at the rice and thinking \"is she going to notice it and remove it? will she? WILL SHE??\" Nope, aaand *flick*. - For the the 2 glasses of water, the glasses came with some serious stains. The teapot lid was also grimey. - I was told one toilet in the ladies washroom was clogged with toilet paper. - I noticed one instance when a server was serving sushi around the restaurant, the table number ticket (the one that indicates which sushi plate is for which table) was put right ON and touching the sushi. Come on, that's just.. sigh. I've noticed this in a couple other ayce sushi restaurants too.  Price: As of today, price was 26.99 for weekday dinner, 24.99 for weekday senior dinner. A bit pricey for ayce sushi restaurant, but I'll give it credit by saying it's one of the better ayce sushi restaurants, especially since it's a bit more unique as it serves pressed and torched sushi.  Obviously, Jabistro's pressed and torched sushi is much better, but Jabistro's 8 piece torched sushi set is 28 bucks (when I had it).  Conclusion: Good sushi, but the quality is still only of the ayce caliber. Worthy to try if you haven't tried yet. Not sure I'll come back again on purpose (just cuz I don't go to ayce that often), but if friends are planning for ayce sushi, I'd recommend Kaka.  Quality: 7/10. Service: 8/10 Value: 7/10. Overall: 7.5/10 - 0.5 (for cleanliness) = 7/10 (not an average)"}
{"text":"Went for a la carte around lunchtime.  Fish was fresh and portions were big for the sashimi bento. Service was uncharacteristically slow but otherwise, a very busy place. Definitely not a relaxed atmosphere.  Prices were so-so. Good enough value for Markham/Richmond Hill."}
{"text":"Overall, I had a pretty pleasant experience at kaka all your can eat. We made reservations for 4 a week and a half earlier and was seated promptly when arrived.  I believe the time limit is 90mins and I found that that was enough for us. Like others have mentioned everything is ordered from an IPad and you don't have to wait for a server to come over and approve. This was a plus.  Instead of ordering drinks, we got a bunch of mango slush lol and treated it as a slushie. Super yummy.  The aburi and blow torched sushi was what I had wanted to try since there aren't many AYCE sushi places that offer this. Overall, for the price that you are paying, this tasted quite good. Obviously you shouldn't expect to eat like Miku Sushi style here, but it actually was not that bad.   We ordered a couple hot food items but those were really nothing special. Good variety though. Since we came on a holiday, they also had the holiday special items, one was a salmon torched sashimi and the other was a tuna torched sashimi. Now these were amazing, I loved the flavours and all of us enjoyed it the most. It's not on the menu though, so we asked them for an additional order after realizing it was only offered on holidays.  The desserts were not bad as well. You regular selection of green tean, vanilla and read bean ice cream. But these actually tasted good, nice creamy and flavourful. They also had green tea creme brulee which I really liked! Would recommend to try if you are there =)   Overall, I had a positive experience at Kaka. For an AYCE Sushi place, the price is on the steeper side, but you get good variety so I wasnt complaining too much. The service was very quick and servers were nice as well =)"}
{"text":"Without a reservation, you can get a table if you walk-in later in the evening. Our party of 5 showed up at 8:50pm and got a seat at around 9:30pm, which I didn't think was unreasonable for a Friday night. The host was really helpful and it felt like he was genuinely trying to get us a table as quickly as he could.   $30.99 for weekend dinner. Last call at 10:30pm.  All you can eat (AYCE) is always available at dinner and only on weekend lunches. (Another reviewer said you need to make reservations for AYCE; otherwise you have to order a la carte. I'm not sure this is true. They didn't say so when I called to ask. Perhaps this has changed?)   The food was pretty good. I wasn't blown away by anything but I think it's impressive that I wasn't really turned off by anything either. AYCE sushi can be dicey, especially when businesses try to cut corners to save costs. I didn't get that vibe here and was satisfied with the food quality. They also gave use everything we ordered in the quantities we ordered.   The service was really fast, both in dropping food off and picking up empty plates. The one server who tended to us the most - shaved head, man - was very friendly and helpful.   There were only two downsides. They missed our pressed sushi and when we followed up five minutes to last call, they told us the kitchen had closed, so while they were good with almost everything else, you should keep track of what you ordered on the iPad to make sure that not only is your last order submitted before 10:30pm but also your follow-ups. The kitchen closed earlier than 10:30pm, so I'd just be cautious.   The other downside was one server/busboy - boxyhead man. He was horrible. Maybe because it was the end of the night, but he was just dropping off random desserts at our table. We told him we didn't order those things and he lifted a piece of paper and said he was going by what our order slip says. Unfortunately for him, we had the iPad with our order history so he was lying rather unsuccessfully. When we asked him what he was putting down, he said \"I don't know. You try it.\" Attitude. We gave the dishes we didn't order to another server who gladly took them back. He then dropped us a handful of 12 spoons. We had five people. He was just over his job and over his life.   Later, when he starting putting down more random desserts (we for sure didn't order seven of one thing that no one liked), we asked him whether these were meant for another table because, again, and we didn't order these, he actually got annoyed with us and told us in a huff, \"Just leave them here and we'll pick it up later.\" I don't know if he meant they'd dispose of them (wasteful) or reclaim them at the end of our meal (unsanitary), but regardless, he shouldn't have given them to us. It's not our problem if you give us something we didn't order. He truly shouldn't be working there.   Overall, the food was pretty good and the service, minus boxyhead, was pretty great and efficient."}
{"text":"Avg medicore ayce place at best, lacks variety. Also not much sake selection. Torch sushi are pretty good service is alright."}
{"text":"Finally came here, this small and constantly booked up AYCA Japanese. I must admit the atmosphere was nice and cozy. The staff was generally courteous. But if you don't have reservations during the peak hours, forget it! You will have to wait an hour plus.   They have a wide variety of hot and cold foods and the quality was generally okay. And with the iPad ordering system, the food came really fast! Within minutes of ordering. However, I have to say that ordering actually took up a lot of my time vs. eating. They had good ribs, the chicken wings were a bit small and the flavours a bit odd. The pork skewers were really fatty. The tempura batter was a bit thick. But the sashimi and sushi were really good. They have the pressed sushi that looked really good but I wasn't too impressed with after trying. It fell apart easily and the tastes didn't go well together. The torched sushi were pretty good, the flames I guess gave it additional flavours. They have a variety of special rolls that are creative and definitely worth a try. Although it would be nice if they came with a description it was hard to tell which roll had what in it. I know most people don't have the noodles and rice but I think the fried udon and the fried rice were pretty tasty.   Overall the food was pretty good for an ayce place. Especially the sushi and rolls. The dessert were really good as well although all varieties weren't available when we were there perhaps it's cause it was a weekday. And the service was superb, they brought our food quickly and got tea for us all the time! Just be aware it's on the pricier side but I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was a bit skeptical because I had heard that the quality of kaka had declined significantly from the first time they debutted several years ago. However, my husband really wanted to try the downtown version for his birthday so off we went. We were able to make reservations and was given our table right on time.   The menu is smaller than some other Japanese places but it's not about the quantity here, the selection was the high end stuff, pressed sushi, blow torch sushi, and sashimi you couldn't find at other places were what you really want anyways. They still had a fair amount of non-sushi stuff (like noodles and rice and short ribs and tempura and other Japanese small dishes) so it's not like the menu is lacking.    The sushi itself is also higher quality than most AYCE sushi places in Toronto and was very fresh. The weird part is, the sushi rice actually really stood out to me. It was the perfect mixture of rice vinegar and the rice was perfectly made. It was quality sushi rice which made the good cuts of fish stand out even more.   Almost everything we had was really delicious. A couple items were only 'okay' but nothing was bad.   The service was quick and attentive and we got all the food we ordered in a timely manner. I have had issues with AYCE places in the past deliberately stalling orders or even 'forgetting' orders (especially for sashimi) but nothing like that here.   Overall, everything went smoothly, the food was delicious, and for $35/pp you're not going to get better value anywhere for sushi in the city.   Definitely make reservations though because we did see quite a few people lining up to wait for a table!  Food highlights: duck confit sushi, all of the pressed sushi, beef short ribs, tako sashimi"}
{"text":"My Bf and I are always coming back with a smile our faces and an even bigger smile on our way out while holding up the stomach!! Definitely a fantastic AYCE option for the #sushienthusiasts - and mark my word you will appreciate their spin on sushi meets a hint of class and kitchen culinary-creativityyy"}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night and honestly, it wasn't that great. The quality pales in comparison to the Markham location.   Food: The food itself flavour wise wasn't bad. However, the rice was kind of dry and some of the fish tasted like it was left out for a really really long time.   Service: The servers themselves weren't bad. They were friendly and always refilled our glasses. However, the service was SLOW. We also had to ask many times for certain dishes because they never came. They also kept screwing up and giving us only twos of everything when we asked for threes.  Menu: I thought they had iPad systems but I guess not? We were manually writing down our orders which isn't a huge deal but I realized for what we were paying... their dinner selection was lacking. They didn't even have seaweed salad. Compared to the Markham location, there's way less options it seems.   Overall, it was decent but not worth my money. Would I go again? No. If you are debating between this location and the Markham one, please stick with the OG one."}
{"text":"kaka is great when torched sushi became really popular. They were basically the first place to do it for awhile. I do appreciate the flavours in specific items offered in their AYCE menu but it isn't enough to justify eating here as only a few select things are really out standing.   The issue is they only really offer the torched items in evening fare and lunch they just offer a small baby menu that's a la carte.   Also would note that it's impossible to get a hold of them anyway to book a reservation for their night time AYCE. It's too risky to show up without a reservation though."}
{"text":"Unlike most, I haven't tried the Markham location so this was my first and only Kaka experience. Without comparing the two, I had a lovely dining experience at the downtown Kaka.   My experience certainly wasn't perfect: 1. A number of their dishes were sold out and we weren't informed until much later but our waiter was ready to take a replacement order if we wished and those replacement dishes arrived very quickly, 2. Their water refilling situation didn't start out well, we were often without water and had to ask multiple times for more but as the night progressed, they were more attentive to our empty glasses, 3. The torched dishes did take quite a while longer to arrive than the other dishes but again, they are still doing their soft opening and had warned us that they were understaffed.  The food was generally very satisfying. We loved even their simple salmon sushi, the rice was perfectly warm and the salmon slices were large and they clearly have chefs who know how to slice fish (this is very important so you don't end up with stringy sushi). Our personal favourites were the hand pressed salmon aburi, honey mustard salmon rolls, onsen egg, tuna tataki, albacore tuna tartar, and their shrimp tempura is the best shrimp tempura I've ever had. The dishes I thought fell short were the eel fried rice (it tasted too burnt and that overpowered the rest of the flavor of dish) and the pork ramen (it was very bland and tasted like someone put plain noodles in miso soup and served some pork on the side.   In terms of portioning, I thought the portions were very well done (we didn't over order like we usually do at ayce places because we didn't want to over eat and be unable to try their different dishes but I did find that their non-hand pressed salmon aburi had too much rice. I understand that larger amounts of rice is necessary to hold the shape of these types of pieces together but I've had the salmon aburi at Miku and they ratio their rice and salmon better. Their dessert size is perfect to try after stuffing yourself with their main dishes, so don't be afraid to order some afterwards, the pictures on the menu look a lot more intimidating than how they actually arrive.   The service is where I thought Kaka truly shined. For those who find service an important deciding factor when choosing restaurants - from their friendly and helpful blonde hostess (I just want to distinguish her from the other hostesses I didn't get to meet because she was absolutely fantastic) to the attentive and patient waiter we had, this was one of the best dining experiences we've had and to find it at an ayce restaurant was pleasantly surprising. I can only imagine that the manager is doing something right in motivating the staff to be so wonderful!  I can't wait to return and try some more of their dishes as I know their menu is still a work in progress."}
{"text":"Too much hype for this place.  Don't get me wrong food and dessert was good. But their torched sushi tasted like butane.  Told the staff about it and they told me it's normal.  Sorry that's not normal,  I've had good torched sushi from other AYCE places,  and it does not taste like butane."}
{"text":"I'm gonna rant for a minute. For my dads birthday, I hype up Kaka Sushi because I had really good experiences  previously. I make reservations at 6pm but my brother and I get there first at 5:30pm to drop off a SURPRISE gift and birthday cake. The waitress tells us there's a 2 hour limit, which is totally reasonable. We asked if we should wait outside until 6pm but she said its OK, this is key for later. 6:30 comes around and my parents are lost, but finally arrive closer to 7pm. We start eating but not even 30 minutes later, the waitress comes up to our table and says outloud, \"The time for your table is almost up, do you want me to bring the birthday cake?\" WHAT PART OF SURPRISE BIRTHDAY DID YOU NOT UNDERSTAND?? My dad hasn't been able to eat cake in many many years due to his diabetes, so I searched extra hard for this cake to surprise him. Now I'm just annoyed but I whisper in her ear, the cake is a surprise and he doesn't know.   At this point my dad is telling the manager that they came only 30 minutes ago and it'd be nice to give them an extra 10-15 mins even. The manager tells them we were there since 5:30pm so we were given enough time. BUT YOU TOLD US WE COULD SIT HERE. I could tell my dad was trying to stay positive even though he was upset, so I speak up explaining that its his birthday and the restaurant has many empty tables, guests didn't have to take our table. The manager just kept saying no we have to leave, we cant stay a minute longer. Bitch we need time to eat the cake and talk about how amazing my dad is. The tables around us were looking our direction because the manager was talking so loud and wouldn't stop talking, so I told her we will leave at 8pm.   I've never been so an AYCE where the 2 hour rule was so strictly enforced, down to the second even under special circumstances. Around 7:40 she takes our iPad menu even though my dad wanted to order a last item. 7:45 my brother tells her in secret to bring the cake. She still didn't get the message that it was SECRET, so she brings the plates and knife first saying \"this is for the cake\" LOOOL seriously?? We start eating the cake at 7:50 and they are still rushing us out, giving us the bill without us asking. The restaurant still has plenty of empty tables at this point -_-. We finally left at 7:56.  This has got to be the most shittiest experience I've ever had. Seeing how sad my dad was through his fake positivity on his birthday was so disheartening, especially leaving an AYCE still hungry. Does that even make sense? Are you going to go bankrupt letting them stay 10-15 mins longer?  The food also has gone down hill from a year ago, just overall such a shit experience."}
{"text":"Ive been here 4 times.. I rave about it all the time. You must book reservations because it is super busy. My most recent visit I noticed that you had to flag a server every time you placed an order which seemed very inconvenient. They food is good but you will find there are aways lost orders that never make it to your table. Torched sushi is amazing, selection is good, service is mediocre."}
{"text":"Here I am at Kaka All you can eat sushi..tonight is our fifth-year anniversary and it was the best choice I could ever make..Thanks to the welcoming and understanding management.  Thanks Kaka, Thanks Jayden"}
{"text":"Was really good when they first started but now the quality is really going down. The torched sushi is their main attraction which I think is still pretty good. But other dishes really need to be worked up to maintain their quality."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for 5pm, came in at 5:00 on the dot and I'm greeted with \"hi! Do you have a reservation?\" Answered with an \"Yes, it's under Dennis/ or my last name\" then I was responded with \"this is you? On the paper?? you are 1 hour late\". Ouch. Not sure why I was accused of being late before I even responded?   They found my reservation under \"David\" afterwards at 5pm and we were able to go in, the table we got was pretty small, felt like Asia style tables. The initial experience getting in was awkward.   Food is above average for AYCE. The torched sushi do not disappoint! All the rolls we tried was excellent above average. Sashimi is fresh and not much variety. Selection is not as great as some other AYCE and cook food is average/slight better than average.   About 20% of sushi order was missed, which is not an issue as you simply reorder on the iPad with a few clicks, but I was scared of double portions showing up and no body responded to the call server button on iPad.   We really wanted the matcha creme burlee, one is the reason we wanted to try this place. Our orders never showed up, had to ask a server why and their respond was its not available tonight . On Sunday at 6:30pm  If you have sushi/rolls cravings and can eat a lot, this will be your place."}
{"text":"This is a new ayce sushi restuarant that opened recently. Caution: you NEED to make a reservation at least a day beforehand. My friends and I made a reservation and still waited for about 20mins for a table. However, that's still better than the poor walk-ins who were told to wait for 1.5hrs.   I am really impressed by the speed the food is brought to you. It was usually about 2 or 3 minutes after ordering (on an ipad!) that the food started coming out. As well, they did not skip any orders or decrease the amount you ordered (very common in ayce sushi). The pressed sushi and the torched sushi were definitely the highlights. However, their sashimi was very fresh for an acye place.   Overall, As this is a new place so I am still skeptical that this place will continue with the same quality. But for now, I will give this a place a 4 star (minus 1 for the wait)."}
{"text":"Hi peeps, this is gonna be a quick review.  Went there yesterday for dinner at 5pm without a RSVP. A table for 2. Very satisfied the fact that we got to seat in at 530 given its getting so popular lately. Thumbs up.  However, food was overrated in my opinion. Saw a lot of pics my frds posted but I think they were alright. Food definitely came quick and waiters waitresses are very attentive.  We ended up paying around $36 person, tax and tips included. I would rather go to somewhere else for a lower price and that's just me.  Hope this helps."}
{"text":"I went 2 days ago for lunch with 5 of my friend.  The highlight i believe the the torchd sushi. It was quite tasty.However the price and the variety of food to me is not the same.  Priced a bit higher then the rest of AYCE. I did like the mango lychee slush  desert.  There are a few things that id like to see more in this buffet. One is maybe more Ramen or udon noodle soup dishes.  Service was not bad and the look of the decor was pretty as well. We sat near the window got a lot of light into the restaurant"}
{"text":"I've been to this place a couple of months ago, the decor is very nice. Simple ordering method as well. (ipad menu + order does make life easier) but a bit pricey and food is not EXCELLENT since the price is in the high range. Overall speaking I would say I would return to give it a 2nd try when I'm in the area. It's a pretty special place, for an ordinary all you can eat sushi place."}
{"text":"I was super excited for the opening of this downtown location, but was sadly left a bit disappointed. I like their menu a lot but their pressed sushi was way too heavy on the rice and their sashimi was terrible. You can definitely tell it's not very fresh. I did however really like their aburi nigiri (torched sushi), so stick to that if you decide to pay a visit. Some of their tataki's were pretty good, but the issue I found is that the sauces didn't always match what the menu said. I think they must've run out of certain sauces and substituted with something else. I probably won't be coming back, but I have to say service was really good which you can't always get at ayce restaurants, so I'm still giving this 3 stars!"}
{"text":"The sushi is quite fresh and there is a lot of variety. The daily specials are also very interesting and tasty.  My only complaint is that it feels very rushed and the servers are not shy to tell you to pay and get the hell out. LOL"}
{"text":"If I can give this place a negative star I would. We came here around 8pm on a weekday and had to wait for 45 minutes.   I wouldn't have mind the wait if the food was good. Nothing was fresh and everything was kind of taste less.   Best part of the meal was the dessert and I just paid 40$ for dessert that I don't care about.  Save your money and time and go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Went to AYCE which was not bad. Some interesting sushi choices but not something extra ordinary. (Or maybe I have had my expectations too high) location is easily accessible and service was quick and attentive. Sad to see they didn't have Saba (Mackerel). Duck was pathetic and dry. Salmon and butterfish was fresh. Torched sushi was good too. Overall an average experience."}
{"text":"Make reservation on weekend even if you go early, the place is small and a lot of people do make reservations. If you did not, you may ended up in the bar.  The food is hands down one of the best ayce sushi you can find. But that comes with a steep price too, 32 dollar on weekend for dinner. The place uses iPad to order, and food comes out fast! The special sushi (the square one) is soooooo good, and the rolls comes in 2pc or 3pc rather than 6 so you can try more. Fish are fresh and taste good, but the grills item and tempura are sub par. The deserts are okay, the mango slushes are really good, feels like real mango or frozen mango rather than additive artificial flavour.  Go for the sushi and sashimi, definitely worth it"}
{"text":"Kaka sushi (yes, let the sniggering about the name continue) is a wonderful all you can eat sushi bar in Markham - Hwy 7/Warden.  What makes Kaka different from other all you can eat places is quality, speed and a heaping does of technology.  You order via iPad and your server confirms your order.  The food arrives remarkably quickly.  We tried a bit of everything, including the house special \"torched\" and \"pressed\" sushi.  Torched sushi is as it sounds - sushi that has been seared warm on the top.  Pressed sushi were wonderful hybrids of rolls/sashimi.  We had a nice variety of sashimi including salmon and butter fish.  We also loved the tempura octopus legs, the light and crispy shrimp, and the octopus balls.  We finished off our very filling lunch with an assortment of desserts - thankfully served in shot glasses - lichee and mango slushes, green tea ice cream, little sherbet like treats.  Open for almost a year, Kaka is still rabidly popular. It can take up to 2 weeks to score a dinner reservation. We lucked out with lunch reservations (there is a 2 hour rule to prevent all day gorgers!) and it was well worth the visit.  Loved the food, and loved the use of the iPad ordering.  It prevents people from being pigs at a traditional buffet, ensures freshly made orders, and gives a great visual of what you're ordering."}
{"text":"Tasty food, excellent excellent service and all around a great experience! Kaka was packed on Halloween, and everyone had gotten into the spirit as we were literally being served by spirits! There were a large variety of food and some special treats that definitely aren't available elsewhere.  I think I had 8 of those mango slush shots that night!  We did experience some of the same that other reviews mention, we booked our table 3 weeks in advance to ensure we could get a table. The price is also a little bit higher than what your typical all you can eat goes for. All in all though, I would highly recommend a visit!"}
{"text":"Standard AYCE Japanese restaurant with a menu offering salads, fried, grilled, rice, udon, sushi, sashimi, handrolls and dessert.  Ordering is done via iPad.  Seating is on the modest size so make a reservation to avoid waiting.  You're given roughly 2 hrs. to dine before you're prompted to ask for your bill.  Pricing is definitely on the higher end, ~$32.99/person.  15% gratuity was also automatically added to our table.  Thought our first experience here was fair but for the price, can't really justify choosing this restaurant over its competitors."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places on Markham!  I've been to kaka countless times and love it every time. The quality is much better than any I've had at other Japanese places. The variety and choices are broad and it's quite unique. One sushi I've had that resonated me was the white thinly sliced tuna and mint leaf sushi. Refreshing! I like the big variety of dessert choices too my fave is definitely the mango slush! I always get around twenty for myself... Haha"}
{"text":"Make reservations before you go! My husband and I had to wait an hour and a half to get seats and this was on a Wednesday evening! The place was extremely packed considering it was a weekday.  You order the food from an IPad which was interesting. The food was good, no complaints. Must try the mango/lychee slush which is on the dessert menu (i had 3 of those!)."}
{"text":"Have you ever wondered what heaven tastes like? This place .. Let me tell you this place is like none other. It's like a quorum of sushi gods gathered together and personally hand crafted each and every sushi piece. From the divine baked oysters with cheese to white tuna that melts in your mouth, each item will have your taste buds orgasm. Their crème de la crème has to be aburi, which is blowtorched sushi, can only be described as food of the gods fit for king - an epicurean delight. Usually at all-you-can-eat you order and wait 10 min, but here we barely waited 3 until they started firing delicious dishes our way. Our order was fairly big, but the staff and chefs weren't even remotely phased. I know this because on top of bringing item after item a guy came and told us \"small order, you should order more\" - and so we did. The saying 'you don't stop eating when you're full you stop eating when you hate your self' does not apply here. If I went into a food coma and died it would be with a smile on my face. The only negative to come out of this is that once you tasted best there's no going back to mediocre. I will no longer be able to go to a sushi place down the street it just won't be the same. I will order white tuna and spit it out like 'wtf is this shit, it doesn't even melt'. Will be back hundo p"}
{"text":"My first two visits when Kaka's was still new and fresh were amazing.  However, my latest visit wasn't nearly as spectacular.  My experience was similar but with the below new 'cons':  - Some menu items have changed for the worse. Some items are missing such as the lobster bisque.  While it was a weird addition in the first place, it has been removed from the menu.  The chicken wings are also coated with a bitter breading that doesn't appeal to me.  The chocolate dessert was also missing the candy balls that they used to put on top.  These changes (and others) make the overall menu feel less polished.  - Several items on the menu were unavailable. There were about 5 or 6 items that were unavailable (maybe sold out) when I went.  Very disappointing since one of them was my favourite dessert (blueberry cheesecake).  - Service While my main waitress was exceptional, there was another that often brought out food.  She didn't smile but made an offhand comment about us in Chinese to our main waitress because we sent back food that we didn't order.  (Someone in our party spoke Chinese and pointed this out)  The rest of our stay at Kaka's was good.  The rest of the food was fresh and delicious and the service was quick.  I'm sorry to say that these new cons coupled with the high price, crammed seating, and the requirement to reserve a table weeks in advance no longer make it worth it.  In a highly competitive market where there are many other alternatives nearby, I highly doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"I have been to the Markham location a several time, but this location is just a joke. The rice in the sushi were soggy. Service was slow and forgot most of our orders. When we decided to get dessert half of their menu was unavailable on a Saturday night at 7:00pm. It was definitely not worth the amount we paid for."}
{"text":"Easily the best sushi buffet I've been too. Food was fresh and the waiters never missed an order. Sushi was of a higher quality than other all you can eat. The torched sushi, pressed sushi and hand rolls were amazing. The desserts are top notch as well, earl grey chocolates ganache was so flavorful. You can tell they care about the quality of food they are putting out. Service was amazing too they accommodated our every need.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to visit this location. We did a walk in. It was a long wait. We asked how long, they said 30 minutes. ended up waiting 1.5 hrs.   Looking at the food, it was not that impressive. It has a very limited selection.   Over all, the food was ok. We tried one of everything on the menu just to get a feel for the food. As stated before, the torched sushi was very impressive. I thought it was very good, The sashimi selection was very limited. I think there was just three or four choices. The red tuna sashimi was not good at all. I have had better at other AYCE.  Overall, it was not a very impressive dinner. Probably won't go back.   Pros:  Torched Sushi Skewers were very good.   Cons  Long wait without reservations Host up front isn't helpful with wait times Very limited selections Tuna sashimi was a disappointment."}
{"text":"If ZERO STARS was an option that's what this place would be. The rice in our rolls was mushy, the hot foods were clinging onto room temperature if that and the beef tataki just left the North Pole. Definitely NOT WORTH $33.99 - I wouldn't even eat here for free!"}
{"text":"Quite literally the worst experience with getting a seat at a restaurant. Came at 630pm, mid-week, was packed so put our phone number down on the minimum hour-long wait. That was totally fine. At 8pm, went back to the restaurant because we never got a call. The line up was even longer. We were told to come back at 830-9pm - surely a table would be open then. By 9pm, still nothing. Went by the restaurant, still a line up, but an entirely different group of people in line. I'm thinking they just completely forgot and never bothered to follow up. Since 630pm, no courtesy call, text, nothing. It was a really sad waste of over 3hrs waiting time. We left."}
{"text":"This AYCE sushi/japanese food place in First Markham Place absolutely blows my mind. Yes, I know, it is a little bit on the pricier side (you're looking to drop anywhere between $30 - $40 for a meal) but it's all you can eat and it's HIGH QUALITY. Kaka opened a few years ago and from what I can tell the quality has not dipped at all. Most sushi buffets usually have an amazing first year then everything goes downhill from there but this place is STILL a gem. Make sure you make a reservation if you're coming for dinner as this place is still as popular as ever.  It offers anything from buffet classics like salmon sashimi, fish roe sushi, and shrimp tempura to restaurant specialties like torched block sushi, beef tataki, delicious rolls (with unique flavour combinations!), and a whole slew of udon and fried meats. For the price you're paying, especially if you can eat a lot at buffets, this is so worth it. Even for a small person like me, I still felt perfectly content satisfying my sushi and sashimi cravings."}
{"text":"When I usually come here the service is good and so is the food. Came here on Easter Sunday and they had a full restaurant with maybe one table waiting at the front. The servers kept trying to rush us which we didn't like and the food took a very long time to come out. We also were missing quite a few items and had to keep asking for them. They told us that our seating time was 2 hours - which is sufficient but it took them over an hour to get everything from our first round to our table. I usually really like this place but the service I received today was really lacking. Sorry but I was extremely dissatisfied with my visit today."}
{"text":"** This review is for weekday lunch, not AYCE  Originally went to First Markham place to have some Aka Teppan but it was closed!  Instead, we ended up going to Kaka.  I must say that I was impressed with the quality of their lunch options.  Weekday lunch is a la carte only, there is no AYCE option.  We ordered two bento boxes (B1-Chicken Katsu and B2-Teriyaki Chicken boxes) - both were $10.99.  Also ordered S5-Torched Beef Roll ($9.99).  Beef Roll came first, and was tasty.  Could have been torched slightly longer for my tastes, but the beef was tender and had a sweet flavour.  The bento boxes are good sized, and come with side salad and miso soup.  Inside the bento is the chicken, rice, 3 california roll pieces, and tempura (2x shrimp, 1 eggplant, 1 sweet potato).  All were delicious.  I was particularly impressed that the chicken was placed on a bed of grilled zucchini, not your typical fried bean sprouts aka chop suey!"}
{"text":"This mall and shopping area is BUSY with a capital B on a Thursday evening and this particular place was packed with a line of people waiting some that had reservations (like us) and the place was just at capacity for my first impression of this place.  Yes it's quite busy, quite full, quite loud and just one big ball of commotion.    We were a group of a dozen and for some reason that made sense each 6 had their own iPad to do the ordering.    Now this place \"way out in Markham\" (I say this because I'm a west ender) is a bit of a drive and there are probably a gazillion AYCE places between Mississauga and Markham (I like to call it MarkJam because many places in Markham are well, jammed) how does this one stand out?    Well they have torched and pressed nigiri sushi on their menu and yes they are quite different from the every day other places you see and what's on other menus out there that simply don't offer this at an AYCE place.  I've seen this before at a la carte places but this place is simply too close to an \"eating factory\" that this somewhat special stand out feature is kind of lost to me.  How can I explain it?  I don't think I can besides to say if this is something that's somewhat special, labor intensive and takes longer (yes it took longer to get that part of our orders) it all falls into place when you see how busy this place can be... on a weeknight... that's not a holiday... that's simply PACKED to capacity so sure, it's not too quiet.  Food orders are lost in the shuffle, that table, our table, who knows who ordered what?  Things are just dumped on the table, nobody knows who asked for it, nobody knows what half the stuff was.  The servers who bring it don't tell you what anything is so you just have to figure it out among yourselves.  I guess if it was just a table of 2 there would be essentially no confusion whatsoever but when the servers don't have the time to explain, describe, or even speak to you this place is what it is... it feels like a factory.  Sometimes I don't like that factory feeling and I hate to say Kaka is probably the epitome of what AYCE is in every form.    To me it just felt like food was just constantly being dumped on the table regardless of which \"side\" of the table ordered anything but rather where ever there was room.  I sort of get that but it's part of the factory experience I'm talking about.  The decor is somewhat nice and upscale looking but overall the food didn't really impress me.  Pressed sushi or torched sushi aside I've had better overall experiences at other AYCE places for about the same money for dinner and I can say they were/are busy too.  This place while we all stuffed ourselves in less than the 2 hour limit we supposedly were given this place to me was just a 3* overall experience.  The decor was fine, the service seemed rather rushed while orders were forgotten, lost or whatever...    The hot food was nothing to be all exalted over and the portions we learned were tiny...  I know you can order more but it's just weird.  Wings are basically half of an already split wing, katsu was rather tiny, karaage we needed to ask for 20 just to get enough to fill a bowl.  There's confusion as to what makes of a \"roll\" or pieces.  I'm guessing now that a roll is half a roll (4 pieces) while everything else is just small.  It makes for more taps on the iPad, more trips, more dishes and more ordering and just more wasted time.    For those that have had experience here, you sort of know what to expect.  For the first timers like myself it's a bit overwhelming and I've been to my fair share of busy but rather more relaxed AYCE atmospheres.    Other people that have been told me it \"used\" to be better so I guess I'll just have to take their word for it.  I've been to places that don't use iPads and have higher quality food and presentation for far less than 28 dollars.  The variety although decent is not that much when compared to other places that will charge 28 dollars.  Kaka although you can get torched and pressed sushi doesn't even have salmon skin.    I'm taking into account the cost, presentation, speed, service, quality of food, novelty, etc I can only give this place 3*.  Their sushi is good at best and their hot food is below expectations for AYCE.  I found the sashimi to not be chilled to my liking as well."}
{"text":"VERY UNORGANIZED in terms of getting a table. Guest had a table reserved a few weeks ago for 10, came in yesterday to realized that they never written it down. Guest trying to snug tables when they only waited less than the given wait time.   Hosting staff was very friendly and quoted me 1 hour for a table. Waited exactly one hour and got a table.   FOOD: The food was alright but was not worth the one hour wait (Whats all the hype about?!) I would only come back when there's less of a wait. It's a digital menu yet they still forgot half (yes literally half) of my order. Blowtorched sushi was a nice touch I gotta give them that.   Maybe if the restaurant was bigger to accumulate the amount of guest everyone wouldn't be awkwardly 8 inches apart (table to table)"}
{"text":"Overpriced, overrated.  I wanted to come here with my family ever since it has opened but could never book a table for the right time.  Finally, after the hype have died down, I was able to book a table on the weekDAY*, the same day I called!  I told my mom about all the hype Kaka has been getting, but by the end of the meal she was left unimpressed and does not understand the hype.  The food came quick but nothing really stood out. The torched sushi and pressed sushi are unique menu items but it tasted mediocre. Extensive menu and a good selection of desserts available.  Staffs were friendly and cleared our table frequently. Weekday dinner is $27.99, which is more expensive than other AYCE places Overall, it was a good experience but would rather go to other AYCE places in Markham to eat."}
{"text":"Overall, the experience itself was not really up to my standard for $35.99 + tax. The location itself was in my opinion not as nice as the location in Markham, though it is bigger and and has subsections for dining. Considering the price is priced as a premium, I would've expected them to have iPads like the Markham location and not torn down menus that they probably recycled from before.   For their selection of food, it also isn't as big as Markham menu but they do have a wider selection seared sushi.   The tataki items (like sashimi but seared on the sides with a dressing) were alright but not really my cup of tea since they put a mustard dressing over it.   The aburi sushi (torched pressed sushi) was again alright but nothing really stood out to me.   The dessert I genuinely didn't like any of the ones that I tried. They were mediocre at most. The green tea creme brûlée was mushy, the kaka special ice cream just didn't taste good, the truffle was too hard and the sake pudding wasn't my cup of tea.   I would probably only go back to the Markham location as it is more put together and have a larger selection."}
{"text":"Food- I personally love torched sushi so this place was perfect for me. The cooked food was pretty good but unfortunately, the special rolls weren't that great.    Ambiance- Modern looking    Service- The service was pretty average and the food came super fast.  Value- Very pricey for just torched sushi and the selection isn't that great compared to other AYCE"}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to try the Kaka! I am very impressed with their options! I would come back here for sure. At first I was a bit turned off with their taking reservations because it literally took me 40 mins before getting through and I had to keep calling because their line is busy.. then i was put on hold....But the food made up for it.  First, I would had given this place 5 star if it weren't for their long wait over the phone. I called this place at LEAST 20 times when I tried to make my reservation, including Facebook msg them which they say they can't take rsvp over FB. The first 2 times I called - it didn't go through. so I called a week later FINALLY went through after 20 min hold. I called two days before my reservation because I need to change the seating number. I must had called 15 times, dialling, re dialling because their phone line was busy. When it FINALLY went though, I was put on hold for 40 mins. Yes 40 mins!!!!! They said they were super busy and was sorry. But seriously, they need up that telephone line, it makes NO sense for anyone to be hold for that long just to change a reservation!   Now, I did give KAKA 4 stars, because their service and food was excellent. The food came fast and they do have very unique sushi. I would come back ONLY if they fix that phone line, I don't want to be hold for almost an hour trying to make my reservation.   Overall, I was very impressed with their food/seating time.   Excellent food. Price - very expensive, so I don't see this as my regular restaurant meal, but once in a while is good. $40 dollar per person including tax and gratuity. Also - they only have the special rolls on the weekend."}
{"text":"Came to Kaka when it was still in their earlier days. Back when we came we had to make a reservation a week before because they get packed quite quickly. My understanding is there are set times to dinners, especially on weekends.  Upon sitting down you get an ipad to pick your order. Every table will get a special plate of daily fish that you cannot order again. (not sure if that has changed since we went back when they first opened). Kaka is quite known for their pressed and torched sushi. At first they were good, but after ordering a second time you get tired of the selection. The rest of the variety on their menu is average. Some of the skewers were good but nothing too special you can't get elsewhere. Their dessert selection is a little bigger but when we went a lot of stuff were either unavailable or sold out for the night.   A typical AYCE sushi restaurant would be a 3 star because you don't get the best quality. This one i'm giving a two because it is a bit more pricier than your standard AYCE. Service was good though when we went and food came out quickly.. but if you were to ask if I would go back again, I would say no."}
{"text":"The Jalapeno Poke had salmon, avocado, jalapeno, tomato, onion, and garlic chips.   These poke fish salads are small enough to try out on your own or to share with a friend.  There is white rice underneath each dish in case you weren't aware..  I liked this one as it was a bit spicy and the salmon poke was good."}
{"text":"The Good:  Good concept Good decoration Food is not bad Salmon Sashimi was fresh  Desert is very good Mango Lychee slushee was tasty  Things to improve:  Certain food can come faster (grilled items such as Calamari and Shrimp) Some orders were lost   Overall a good experience : )"}
{"text":"Came here as Yelp advertised their 15% early bird special. When we arrived on Monday at noon, showed them the coupon, they said it was not valid as it was only for the dinner price. Needless to say our party was not pleased as we came here based on this promo. For them to renege on this, which is so clearly written, is unacceptable. Do not foresee myself returning for their promotional terms are so uncertain.  The manager made no effort whatsoever to speak with us during this confusion. Nowhere was there any mention of 'premium lunch' options on their menu nor promotional materials either.  Also noticed they had signs at the front stating they only accept cash and debit now."}
{"text":"Okay people, I'm not really sure what the hype about this place is but truthfully I am not a fan of this place. As a matter of fact, im not a fan of torch sushi. I was so excited to eat at this place because of all the reviews but when me and my boyfriend saw the menu selection and what it tasted like, there are definitely better choices of ayce sushi places out there. But if you're really into torched sushi, then by all means give this place a 5 star rating.   I called in to make reservations but they were full until 9pm that night for a table for 2. We walked in and got a spot at the bar right away. The items looked delicious ams the torched sushi looked interesting. But I felt like it tasted like cooked sashimi. There wasn't really anything to rave about. The cooked stuff on their menu was probably better than the torched sushi and special rolls that they have. They didn't have makarel sashimi which was disappointing. We had their cooked octopus and udon (broth was amazing). But the beef ribs came out cold, like they had pre cooked it and left it there until the next order for them came in. The tempura dipping sauce was not the same and was little less flavourful.   The desserts were also wonderful, crème brule was amazing but I would say thats all seemed appealing. Service was awesome but this place isn't all that people say it is. But I really didn't think the food was that great. Glad to have tried it once but I don't think we'll be coming back here."}
{"text":"It was my first time here and we had a group of 8 people. We had heard really good reviews and were excited to try out this new spot. The food was great and there were a lot of different dishes you wouldn't normally be able to order at an all you can eat place. The service was decent.  The menu had a good variety of desserts and we were all very excited to try each one. We ordered a bunch of green tea ice creams and noticed that the ice cream was completely frozen and hard. Upon eating a spoon full of it, one of us bit on something hard and thought it was odd that the ice cream was crunchy. He spat it out, thinking it was a piece of ice. However, after inspecting this clear piece of what we thought was ice, we realized it was GLASS. We immediately called the server over and informed him we had just found a piece of glass. He did not believe us and claimed it was just ice in the ice cream. We insisted he take a second look at this piece of glass as we were POSITIVE it was glass. He then proceeded to tell us that he would bring us another ice cream instead. After I inspected my own ice cream, I found one large piece of glass as well as several smaller pieces sitting on top of the ice cream. We ended up finding glass in 4 of the ice creams. We called the server over again and he took back all our ice creams.   A lady came over to speak to us, I assumed she was the manager, and apologized for the incident explaining that it was their first time using these new glass bowls and it must have started to crack in the freezer. She offered us 15% off on our bill. When the bill came, she informed us that if we paid cash, we would receive 10% off the bill. To our surprise, there was only 15% off but when paying cash we would already be receiving 10% off. So really, we received an additional 5% off for nearly swallowing glass which I find APPALLING. Although they did apologize, they definitely did NOT compensate us for the risk they put us at for almost ingesting glass. They are very lucky none of us swallowed any glass!! I will NOT be recommending this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"I want to give this a 4/5, but it's more so of a 3.5-3.75 because of their limited sashimi options and one not-so-great experience from their service.   The food is good! I really like their pressed sushi and their torched sushi. The pesto in the pressed sushi gave it a very interesting flavour, and I enjoyed it a lot. I don't really order any fried things or rice/noodle dishes since those fill you up quickly so I can't really comment on those dishes. I have tried the baked mussel, which is really good. I also quite like their desserts, especially the passionfruit dessert!   They don't have a lot options in terms of sashimi, which was a little disappointing. I'm not a fan of butterfish so that limits the menu for me even more.   The fish seems fresh and is nicely portioned.  The place is nicely decorated and has dim lighting and has a modern feel to it. I quite like all the sake bottles near the entrance. The food comes quite fast so you don't have to wait too long for it.   Service is okay. The first time I went for the early bird special (you reserve a spot at 4:30 and you must leave by 6), my friends and I were done at 5:15. We decided to order dessert at that time and it came very quickly so we didn't have to rush to eat it or anything. However, one of the waiters kept asking us if we wanted the bill and kept reminding us we had to leave by 6 even though it was barely 5:30. It was really annoying because we were trying to enjoy our dessert and yet this waiter kept bothering us. We ended up leaving at 5:45, just so he would stop pestering us. Overall, the staff seem friendly and helpful, but it was just this one incident that kind of threw me off.   I will be back again, though! That pressed and torched sushi has really made an impression on me. :b"}
{"text":"I came here with my friends last week for an early birthday celebration. We made reservations and was seated right away. I'm not sure if it's because it's our first time for most of us but we were given a complementary sushi plate. We ordered a lot of things on the menu and I have to say that the food came out really quick. One thing though is that the chicken wings did not look like wings at all. They did not look like what it was shown on the iPad. It came in legit bite size covered in peanuts. We actually thought it wasn't our order lol. Same goes for buffalo wings..I would stay away lol.  The pressed sushi and the torched sushi was good but of course if you compare it to places like jabistro or miku then they obviously take the cake. But for an ayce place, this was good enough. Their sashimi was alright, not as fresh as we were hoping. We also ordered a lot of dessert, my favourite would have to be the mango slush, mango lychee, green tea crème brule. Kaka is pretty expensive for ayce dinner, so I wouldn't come here often."}
{"text":"Decent ayce sushi place but it's a bit pricey. Their \"special\" rolls can be a hit or miss. It's like playing beanboozled but with sushi.  You get lucky if you get a good one, and it's unfortunate when you get am odd tasting one. Theyre known for torched sushi which was decent but nothing special. There are other ayce places that are better priced with the same or better quality of food. It was also really loud in there, but that could jus be my age showing."}
{"text":"I've been calling for several days to inquire if they do AYCE for lunch on weekdays and never reached anyone after waiting for more or less 15mins per call. So we trekked our way there only to find out that they don't.   Next time please answer your calls."}
{"text":"Fish is not fresh. Aburi sushi is not seasoned properly. Service extremely slow. Orders are not taken properly. The worst AYCE in DT."}
{"text":"Price aside... By far superior in quality then most ayce places. Unique menu and just great food all around. There are some hit and miss on their menu but i would dare say most are hits. Downside is the wait time, i recommend making reservation asap, early as possible as they tend to be booked solid. It is pricey but the experience is worth the price of admission."}
{"text":"Went last week for a weekday lunch, which is à la carte.   Ordered two sushi rolls and one order of their aburi sushi.  The sushi was good, but I had to wait 40 minutes for my food, which is just unacceptable, especially for lunch, when most customers would need to rush back to work.  I noticed the other tables around me were also waiting a long time for their food, and some were cancelling items they ordered because obviously they had to leave.  I would have thought they would have ironed out these sort of kinks after being open for several weeks, but apparently not.  I won't be returning, not when there are so many other options in the area."}
{"text":"Ambiance/decor-5 Service-2 Food-1 Strikeouts-0/3  I came in with mediocre expectations and left slightly disappointed. Not a good sign for sure. Just like any AYCE sushi, the orders are never right. They get the wrong table, the wrong amount, and the orders weren't even ridiculous like 30 salmon sashimi. I ordered 20, I got 10 sashimi, and that's after reminding them of where half the first order was. The presentation of the food was at best at par with other sushi restaurants.   What I did expect to be better and unique was the torched sushi and the Oshizushi(pressed rectangular form). Honestly, I've never had pressed sushi before, but I've had torched. The torched was nothing special here and definitely the normal rolls were better. The pressed sushi was a huge disappointment, not due to the flavour but the size. It should be the same size as a normal nigiri, but this was deliberately cut in half, thus ruining the style, the flavour and what it represents. The only thing satisfying about the meal was the cooked oysters with cheese and saba nigiri. Saba or mackerel is surprisingly hard to find these days at AYCE restaurants. It's starting to become more expensive and rare.  Aside from Sushi, the next best thing they offer is definitely the ice cream selection (black sesame/green tea/red bean), and the creme brulee (green and normal). The custard in the creme brulee was surprisingly not too sweet and not too plain and had a rich green tea flavour for that alternate one. Unfortunately, this is not enough for me to come back again. If you really want AYCE, this is not a bad place for selection as everything in terms of quality is average, but the price is hefty. There is no lunch special price, it's essentially $40/person after tax and tip.  Be prepared to dish out the cash!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious, especially the specials you get on the weekends. I loved the whole seating and decor, felt super comfy and the food was high quality. The fish was especially fresh and I didn't feel the usual tummyache i get when i go to AYCE sushi places.   Only downside is the price but it's worth it once in a while!"}
{"text":"Been hearing a lot of buzz about this place lately, so a friend and I decided to check it out with my boyfriend tagging along.   We've heard about how hard it is to get a table, so we did try to call for a reservation. The recorded message is unclear and hard to understand, but I was quite lucky to have some one pick up within two minutes. I tried to make a reservation for 5pm, and he told me he can put me down but we'll only have 1.5 hours seating time, if we want longer then we can walk in at 5pm to get a table at the walk in section since it's not too busy by that time. Then he just would put me down for the reservation and insisted I walk in, which is really weird.  Luckily we got there at five and there were plenty of tables. By the time we were almost finished with our meal around 7, it was full house.  Service was quite attentive throughout the night, dishes were brought out very fast and cleared even faster from the table.   The food itself I find mediocre. There's not too much selection, especially the sashimi (only three kind of fish). The beef sashimi was quite good, so was the pressed sushi and grilled sushi, some appetizers were quite good as well. However, the grilled food and skewers were really just mediocre, the wings were flavourless, so we're the chicken hearts. Beef short ribs weren't tender. A few things I did like was the karaage and the grilled vegetables, also the lamb and potato stew.   Overall it was an okay experience, wouldn't say it's not worth the money, but wouldn't come back here anytime soon unless someone wants to pay for my meal."}
{"text":"I normally don't like All you can eat but this one was different. They strive to serve better quality items by having a smaller menu. The service can be a bit slow if they are packed which is always the case but it is worth the try. Advice is book a week or more in advance to ensure you get the time seating you want."}
{"text":"This restaurant was the buzz of the town a while ago, but my husband and I finally decided to try it out on Valentine's Day for an early dinner.  The restaurant is visually appealing -- however, when I made my way to the back to use the facilities, there was an employee taking a nap in the hallway (which was very odd to me).  The service was decent, the food was okay -- but they do have some delicious highlights (ox tongue, torched sushi, the desserts were yummy!).    Was it worth the price? To me? Not so much."}
{"text":"pretty average, not worth the hype imo the markham location would prob be a better bet service was good but id rather go somewhere else for food"}
{"text":"Good selection for an AYCE place. Hot food came out sizzling. The food we ordered came pretty quickly. The service was fine but not great. The sushi and sashimi could have been more fresh. Some of the fancy rolls tasted funny. The dessert was absolutely wonderful though!"}
{"text":"The food was quite delicious.  However,  the service was completely garbage.     Here are the low lights:  1.   Rushing our group to finish when there were no aforementioned time limit.    This was after 45 minutes of sitting down.  2.  Charging us a mandatory service charge of 18%  3.  Charging a rediclous amount for corking fee  4.  Literally,  the waitress try to take the food I'm eat away,  in efforts to rush us out."}
{"text":"The food is just average, not as good as they say. I was charged tips twice?never go there again!"}
{"text":"It is a more expensive ayce sushi but if you go with a big group and call well in advance it is worth it. The quality is above average other ayce for sure and the desserts are amazing"}
{"text":"Not bad for an all you can eat sushi. One of the very few that have torched sushi on their menu. They over do it on the torching though, added extra burnt flavor on the seafood made me give them only a 3 Star."}
{"text":"I didn't know how sushi could get any better, but then I had the pressed/torched sushi here and it was like entering a whole new sushi world.   I didn't get the all you can eat, but came at lunchtime and ordered the pressed sushi combo - it was 9 pieces (3 of the kaka special, 3 salmon, and 3 shrimp). Each piece looks like a little box of rice, with fish and sauces both inside and on top. It's made fresh and is brought out quick. Also the torching gives it a completely different flavor compared to regular sushi rolls. It was my first time having it and was pretty impressed.  It might be a little more expensive than some other sushi places (particularly for the pressed sushi), but the restaurant is in a convenient location, is high quality and the service is good.  Would definitely recommend coming and trying the pressed sushi."}
{"text":"The food was pretty decent and very filling. Many of the sushis have lots of rice so order a little bit at a time!   When I ordered sashimi they never gave the right amount of pieces that I ordered which is annoyed.   Ordered 2 octopus balls but only one came, and a order of beef cubes and there were literally 3 pieces of beef in the bowl....  maybe they have a weird portion size that is different from the Toronto location but I am not too sure"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went for date night and we were super excited because we heard so many positive things about this restaurant. Prior to going we took a look at the previous yelp reviews/photos and were impressed by the menu diversity. We called to make a reservation and was nicely greeted and helped by the hostess.   The food quality is great- expect fresh sashimi and a lot of yummy sushi rolls. I really enjoyed the special which was eel with gold flakes. Ou- also the mango slush was sooo good, it was more like an actual drink instead of a dessert.   Service was average- nothing out of the blue.   The atmosphere was modern and clean! We would definitely come back again. :)"}
{"text":"Vegetarians beware.. My girlfriend and I went to Kaka because of the amazing reviews. We went on an early Sunday afternoon. The restaurant was definitely not busy. The atmosphere is beautiful and the servers seemed very nice. The first issue we ran into was waiting 45 minutes for our first place of food to come out. I ordered mostly fish/meats and my girlfriend (the vegetarian) strictly ordered tofu / cucumber rolls. She ordered at-least 5 6-pieces of each and she got 1 6-piece after 45 minutes. We ate our food and started to wait for the rest. 20 minutes later and nothing had come out. I made a complaint and they brought us some food 5 minutes later. My girlfriend had 1 more 6-piece brought out to her, except this time she realized there were fish eggs on it. We were also told after this long that they had no more tofu. Being a vegetarian, she was disgusted. The manager came out, who was very kind and told us she would be handling our meal from now on. She brought my girlfriend some fresh cucumber rolls.. which also had fish eggs all over them. Thankfully the situation was handled and the manager was great about it; Our meal ended up being free. The food *I* had was amazing and the desserts were absolutely incredible, and because of the amazing service, we left a good tip. I likely will go back here, but not with any vegetarians.   There were also not many vegetarian options on the menu to begin with.."}
{"text":"The hype is finally over and I finally get to try this place. You know, I said I don't write 3-star reviews, but this place is very 3-star, which confuses me about what this hype was all about.   I thought their hot foods & sushi were nothing special. Extremely average but very aesthetically pleasing to the eye. Perhaps the hype was for their torched pieces (new at the time, but it's old now) which I'm not too fond of simply because I can't appreciate the torched taste/smell on my fish when placed to my mouth. I didn't think any of their dishes deserved significant praise.. Their presentation was amazing though, those perfect prisms of sushi are so cute.  It is a noticeably smaller place, could be because of the darker space or the symmetrical layout.. regardless, this works in their favour because their service speed is excellent!! They were quick (almost instant) to confirm our iPad orders, and our dishes (appetizers, grilled items, sushis and all) came within 5-10 minutes, no kidding. For this, +1 star.   Overall, decent food, ok sushi, and because it's a small place it's also not too loud, a very controlled atmosphere, which serves for a comfortable dining experience. Nothing special really, with that said I think it's overpriced for the food it makes up with the service. My take: I don't think I will come back though for the food (just friends). Say?nara!"}
{"text":"Went here for a lunch when it wasn't all you can eat for the blow torch sushi, the place is cool the service is super good but the blow torch sushi is super underwhelming. The bento box was really good though"}
{"text":"My fiance and I made reservations here for 9:00pm. We arrived around 8:15 and asked the hostess to call us if a table opens up before our scheduled time. The hostess called us at about 8:30 and said there was a table for us. It was really appreciated because honestly, I wasn't expecting a call because they were pretty busy.  We ordered the standard miso soup, green salad, and miso salad to start, along with a bunch of their other items. We got all our other items and never got our starters, so we re-ordered and they came pretty promptly.  Their torched sushi is really good. The torching really brings out the flavour of the fish. Their square and torched sushi (forget the name) was really good too! I wasn't a huge fan of the beef one, just because I'm not used to having beef in my sushi, but I can see how others would like it. My favourite was the shrimp and mushroom one. It was topped with a really delicious sauce.   Everything was fresh and delicious. Items arrived shortly after being ordered. The manager came to check up on us and welcomed us to ask her for anything if we needed it and our server was a little awkward, but friendly.   My biggest gripe with Kaka is their name. Just kidding. Since we arrived so late, some items weren't available. I was really looking forward to some of their desserts that were sold out for the night, which is a bummer, but I kind of expected that."}
{"text":"The lunch bento was decent but nothing extraordinary. The spicy salmon roll had a nice fish to rice ratio (more fish than rice). But not enough spicy sauce!  The pork katsu was good. Nicely fried with a bed of vegetables.   The service was slow during lunch they were scatter brained. Bringing a late order after 50min and we had to ask to cancel it twice. The service was friendly and the decor was nice in a newly renovated restaurant.   Hopefully my next visit will be more efficient."}
{"text":"Great food, service is quick even with have a big party (we have 14 people). Really like the blow torched sushi and their grilled items. For the price point I don't think you can get any better anywhere else."}
{"text":"Portions were so small, chicken wings were cut in half. But the service was great very friendly, crime brûlée was A1 the fact that it was all you can eat was great and makes up for the small portions. One of the better all you can eat sushi places in markham!! They also have okra ! It's fantastic and you must try the udon with white cream sauce!"}
{"text":"Reservation required for the 15% off early bird discount and you have to be done eating by 6pm.   Came here on a Friday and made use of the 15% check in discount. Luckily my friend made a reservation as they said that discount is only applicable if you made a reservation which was not indicated on Yelp.   Other than that incident everything else was great. I like the fact they offer a large variety of choices with some unique options such as oshizushi and bacon wrapped snap pea.   The service was good and they left a pot of tea at our table so that we didn't have to constantly ask for refills. The food also came out quickly."}
{"text":"Hands down best AYCE I've been to. I haven't been going to AYCE recently just because I felt the quality is lackluster.   Kaka's rate was quite above average; lunch being a bit over $30 a person but I did not regret it at all.   Quality of sushi was definitely better than usual Chinese-run AYCE sushi and I also fell in love with the oyster.   On top of that, the food came at record-breaking speeds! Orders were made through iPad. I went with my family of 5 so we ordered quite a bit on the first order. It all came in a bit over 5 minutes!   Going for AYCE is reservation only and we had a table reserved for 2 weeks later. Again: ALL WORTH IT. Definitely coming back here.   P.s. Very odd name but it doesn't even phase me at this point."}
{"text":"We came for ayce on a weekday dinner. The iPad ordering system is extremely convenient, although we did find that only around 80% of the food ordered actually arrives. The blow torch Sushi series is the best in my opinion, and there is a wide variety to choose from. I'm giving the place 5 stars because of the service - they were really nice and not what I expected from a Asian operated restaraunt. We accidentally dropped and broke a plate while handing it back to the server, and they were extremely apologetic and concerned even though it was really our fault. Would recommend :)"}
{"text":"Update (April 2018)  I came back to visit on a weekday and noticed a huge difference in speed and quality of service. For starters, only half of the restaurant was opened  so the wait staff and chefs can service diner in a timely manner. More items were available than from my previous visit and I appreciated that orders were small so even a table of 2 can try a variety of dishes. It really seems like KaKa is learning from their soft opening and I am looking forward to returning once they've hammered everything out.   ______________  I decided to check out this new location before their official opening, expecting some delay in service and unavailable items.   We put our name on a waitlist and was told to come back in 1.5 hours, not bad for a Friday night. Once seated, we placed our order and that's when things went downhill. Within the first hour of our seating, we only received 2 orders (8 piece pieces of sushi in total). The pieces came out cold but the flavour was good and we were . Looking around, it was obvious that everyone was experiencing similar slow service. It turns out the kitchen lost our order - no problem we'll order again. Our meal lasted close to 3 hours.   Quality of the dishes was nothing close to the Markham location - significantly smaller selection, poorly cut sashimi pieces and the table beside us found a bone in their salmon sashimi. With the exception of offering aburi sushi, Kaka is an average AYCE restaurant at best. Not sure if it's worth the $10 premium.   Don't come here expecting the same quality as the Markham location."}
{"text":"Got here around 8pm on a Monday and it was jam packed. Thought we'd have to wait at least 20 minutes but we were immediately seated if you ate at the bar. Good for 2-3 people. The sushi was made fresh as we saw the chef make it in front of us. In terms of the quality of the fish it was pretty good. The salmon sashimi was pretty fresh. There were no specials on Monday but I've heard they do special sashimi on weekends with the all you can eat menu. The food came very fast. We ordered from an iPad and 5 minutes later food came. The servers also would come and check up on you as ask if we enjoyed the food. Very friendly people. Overall I enjoyed the experience. For 1 adult it costed about $32 including tax and tip. Pretty average price nowadays at ayce sushi restaurants. Will come again!"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times in a 5-month span: in July about 2 weeks after they opened, beginning of October and this past Friday. I have really mixed feelings about this place but it's interesting to see how it's changed in a relatively short period of time.  My first visit was absolutely fantastic. Delicious food with great service. I remember telling myself the quality will inevitably go down as I couldn't possibly see them maintaining it at that level.   Sadly, it came true.  The food is still quite good, better than your average AYCE for the most part. If youre a fan of kitchen items, this is the place.   On weekends they serve a complimentary off-menu platter containing 3 types of nigiri and an oishizushi (can't remember the names) which is a nice touch. Sashimi (salmon and tuna in particular) and rolls are great.   The problem is that their torched sushi which is their signature, lacks consistency. I noticed on my second visit that the torched salmom nigiri had lacked a bit of flavor. By the third time I went, it was just too slimy. It's not torched properly which leaves it in an awkward state - too soft for sashimi but just not cooked enough for aburi. Torched tuna nigiri had a bitter aftertaste. Blah. I ended up preferring the salmon and shrimp pressed sushi more.  I couldn't help but notice the change in their servings. The first time around, they king oyster mushroom was served in its entirety (where you can tell that it's a mushroom). This past Friday, one-third of the mushroom's STEM was considered 1 piece. I ordered 2 and out came two squares that was barely recognizable until I actually ate it.  The green tea icecream was also terrible. It was rock hard making it almost possible for my spoon to cut through it. Maybe it was an off-day or something.  Aside from that, some of my favorite go-to items are the lobster bisque, baked oyster and mussels and mango lychee slush.   Now let me talk about the service and food pacing. Servers are really nice and attentive. I didn't really have any problems with that. The thing that irked me the most was how painstakingly slow the food comes out the 2nd round. This goes for both my 2nd and 3rd visit. Food flies out of the kitchen at an overwhelming pace the first round, filling up every inch of our table. Then when you order seconds, it's a 20 minute wait and not all the food comes out! I'm sure this is a tactic used by many AYCE places but it's a little ridiculous. It appears that food is prioritized by newness of table sitting rather than when the order is actually placed because I saw food being brought out to tables all around us that just sat down. I went to KAKA with different groups of people and you know there's something wrong when your friend asks about your visit with \"was it really slow this time too?\" and you actually have to answer yes.  Prices also went up. First visit was $28.99 for weekend dinner and this past Friday was $31.99. Tip options start at 15%. I don't know if it's even worth it to shell out $40 per person after tax and tip when their signature stuff is so meh now. It also doesn't help that coming here is such a production in itself where you have to book so early in advance and can't just go when you're trying to satisfy a craving (unless you take a leap of faith doing a walk-in and get lucky )."}
{"text":"Previously Sense, not sure if it's same owners, but decor has not been changed.  First time walked in was told all full for the night, therefore made reservation 2 days ahead for a weekday dinner, and I am not disappointed.  The lobster bisque is ok, however as my friend said, still beats the miso soup.  Skewers are deep fried which is expected for ayce, lamb skewers are seasoned and might be a bit salty for ladies but it's fine with me, tongue and pork belly are barely seasoned and the cut is too thick.  They give u a sushi platter which most of them cannot be ordered from iPad and most are pretty good, the pressed sushi is one of a kind for ayce jap restaurant, and I only know ja bistro is well known for serving it.  Speciality rolls are just average to me.  My favorite however is the grilled sirloin, the meat is fresh and well cooked.  The mango slush I believe I ordered more than 12 cups I think, as it taste great and perfect after salty food, however I would suggest changing it to bigger containers so every table doesn't have to order a dozen or two just to satisfy their sweet tooth.  My only complain is the service from some staff as we had to ask few times for tableware, but that is only toward certain staffs, as most are friendly and accommodating.   Overall the restaurant is definitely a go again for me and my friends, hope it keeps up the quality and hopefully there will be more dessert selections."}
{"text":"I checked into this place on a monday night. And did not make a reservation.   It was very crowded. Although as tables cleared i can tell the system for placing tables is a bit unorganized as there is a huge waiting crowd and lots of empty unoccupied tables.For a new place a little bit of disorganization is understandable.                    On to the food. The food overall was below average for the area in markham especially considering all the ayce jap buffet. The sashimi was clearly not fresh i went with someone else and had a table for 2. After eating the sashimi salmon,tuna, and hokkigi my friend felt not well and head to the bathroom. It might just be the way they defrost or whichever.     The sushi overall although the menu had a lot of selection and we tried many as seen in the pictures it felt average at best. The rice was not the right texture for sushi. The size was fine.         The cooked food area of the restaurant i felt they tried hard and i give them applause to make new fishes and more variety such as baked lamb shoulder. Or spring egg which was good. Their cooked food overall was better then the sushi as care was taken with most of the menu and variety is plentiful.                   The desert was average for an ayce japanese place. They had a lot of variety in the menu however when we tried to order. A good half of the desert menu was unavailable.        Overall as a japanese ayce restaurant  it is serviceable, although for the price it is definetely also not as good as similar priced restaurants. However by no means would this be in my top 5 of markham/richmond places given the areas abundance of japanese ayce"}
{"text":"All you can eat dinner was $34.99 per person on a weekday. It has some unique and different dishes than most ayce sushi places. However, the food did not taste that good or special. The sashimi did not taste all that fresh. The food comes out slow and comes out in random quantities. For example we ordered 4 fried shrimps and instead we got 9. Some of our orders never came, other times they were duplicated a Portions came out really small. The wait staff did not know which dishes they would brought out, so when we wanted to reorder a specific dish they were not helpful at all.   Rather disappointing experience and not worth the price. Would not be visiting a second time."}
{"text":"Went with a bunch of friends on the second day of their grand opening. I would say service was good, food was decent. Problem is I do think they need more servers and kitchen staffs. I don't mind if there is no IPad to order food in an AYCE restaurant as long as you have enough servers to help us immediately.  Unfortunately, we had to wait forever for our server to come to our table. Asked three times to different servers to refill our water. Ordered 10 dishes only 5 would come. Food is coming out very slow, more than half of the time we would have no food on our table and wait for our food to come. Should be more prepared before your grand opening. Will definitely never be back again."}
{"text":"KaKa was better when it first opened, so that is why I give it now 2 stars.  It's unfortunate that as their business for bigger, their quality declined. The rolls are now more rice than toppings, and it feels like they're just trying to keep up with demand instead of ensuring their food is top notch.   I would say that their torched sushi and pressed sushi are better than the other ayce that serves them, but other than that, there's not much variety of items on the menu if you come on weekdays.   Sashimi quality is ok too. Cold enough but sometimes inconsistent. I do enjoy their dessert options. Their hot foods are ok as well, but nothing special. I do enjoy their onsen egg though. Very well done!   Overall, I would come again to see if their quality gets back to what it was when they first opened. Hopefully they will because their food was good for ayce!!"}
{"text":"Since there is no waiting I went in for 2. Service was very good. The food was pretty good. The choice was not as much as I wanted. The atmosphere was very comfortable. The only thing I didn't like was when I speak Cantonese to the waitress she spoke back mandarin. If she didn't know Cantonese she could use English. It was the second time I spoke to her. Maybe she didn't know English ."}
{"text":"I was recommended by a friend, who said it's the best ayce sushi in Toronto. Tried to make a reservation three times but they were fully booked. Finally get a table the fourth time I called and I was very excited to try.   However, the experience wasn't as good as expected. I won't complain about the service since it's an ayce restaurant. The quality of the sushi and sashimi waz average comparing to other ayce. What makes this place special is the torched sushi they offer, and they were indeed fairly good for an ayce sushi place. But for the amount we spent (70+ for two), I would rather go to a much better not ayce place to eat and I could have much better torched sushi.   Overall it's a better ayce sushi place, but I won't go back."}
{"text":"We went to Kaka for a bday celebration (around 12 people) during lunch time.  Since it's all you can eat, we pretty much ordered most of the things on the menu.   Here are my recommendations:  1. Avocado tuna tower - in a heart shape. In layers of sushi rice on the bottom, avocado in the middle and tuna on the top.  There are some crunchy stuff on the top that gave some different texture.  2. Tataki - it's a type of raw fish but slightly seared on the outside. Besides sashimi, it's in the must order list.  3. Onsen egg - if you are okay with half raw egg, this is something you should try. Onsen means hot spring in Japanese. See my pic, the dish looks like the egg is bathing in hot spring. I like the flavour. I've been to quite a few Japanese restaurants but this is my first time trying an Onsen egg.  4. Tako wasabi seaweed salad - if you can take raw octopus and wasabi, this is a must order dish. (Tako is octopus in Japanese) I love it with sake. The wasabi paste helps reducing the fishiness of octopus.   5. If you do not enjoy any raw things, ie sashimi, and only wants some sushi with cooked fish on the top, just simply order something from its chef recommended or signature dishes.   6. For dessert, I like its mocha ice cream. My friend also likes cream brûlée and mocha brûlée. But I didn't try them.   I have to say, as a buffet, its quality is pretty good. The ingredients are fresh, the plate setting and presentation, including its plates, look quite high-end. The service is good as well."}
{"text":"My favourite all you can eat sushi place in Markham. Even though this place can get really busy, the workers always check in with you to notify you of wait times. They have a large selection of sushi, sashimi and izakaya items - and they're all high quality and fresh. I would definitely recommend the baked mussels, pressed sushi, and eat lots of dessert!"}
{"text":"Update (April 7, 2018)  I came back again to visit and the service is still iffy. We were missing several orders, items were crossed off the menu (or not available), and the food came out slowly.   ---  KaKa is in beta testing.   I went to the Markham location hoping for a familiar experience downtown.   I came here wanting to binge on aburi (blowtorched) sushi, and the restaurant delivered. Compared with my last visit to the Markham location, I can say that objectively, the quality of the food is better.  The sashimi came in nice large chunks and they didn't skimp on ingredients for the sushi.  However, keep in mind that the menus are a bit different and there are fewer items available downtown.   The service is where things felt glitchy: some of our ordered were duplicated, they were missing some items from the menu, we asked for tea and received hot water instead, and some orders took a long time. Surprisingly, it was the aburi sushi that came out the quickest.   Overall, this restaurant has a lot of potential. I'll definitely be back once they've ironed out the k"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to try Kaka out upon inviting myself to my friends date.   The restaurant is small but the open concept makes it look bigger. Hence the long wait for reservations.   It's great to bring something new to the game. Kaka offers blowtorch sushi in Toronto AYCE as one of the first.   But   The sashimi selection is smaller than most AYCE restaurants.   As some mentioned the price - I'd prefer to take out the AYCE factor and go to a specialty blowtorch Japanese restaurant.   I throughly disliked the desserts except for the mango lychee slush. Even though they had a big dessert menu.   I didn't find their sashimi and sushi very fresh.    Service was good for AYCE.   I probably won't be back until I can see a bigger menu."}
{"text":"Poor selection + pricey = never again  They had a lot more varieties when they first opened.  Now they cut off a lot of items but price remains the same.  Rip off!!"}
{"text":"Came here for the all you can eat lunch so we didn't have to wait for the long lines at dinner time. it was about 28 per person before taxes.  We didn't find it special or anything stand out. The pressed and torched sushi is a disgrace, please pay more and go to Miku instead. But it is AYCE afterall.   the ipad ordering system is a good idea, Most of the food came, except some came really slow."}
{"text":"*only reviewing the lunch special/service*  The quality of food and service lives up to its name. I was here with 9 guests and each dish came out separately after 1.5-2 minute intervals (hence waiting 15-20 minutes until we could eat together).  The salad was lacking dressing and the bowl had too much water (although good to know they wash the salad).   The miso soup was barely warm and rather gritty (see attached picture once it settled).   The 'chicken teriyaki' bento box was rather disappointing. The chicken is served on vegetables and due to a lack of sauce, almost resembled chicken fajitas. The tempura was more oily than most places and even the size of the shrimps was quite disappointing (see picture of baby shrimp). The California roll was average, which is shocking, since KaKa boasts about 'premium sushi flavors'.    Even though this is a lunch special, for 13.99 the quality should be there. The sushi place previously here (Sushi Queen) served better quality food and similar portions for 8.99. Yes the interior of this place looks improved but there is no excuse for taking more than 1 hr to serve a mediocre lunch special!"}
{"text":"#1 tip - Make a reservation. Just like everyone in here has advised, it is wise to be calling ahead of time to reserve. This is a very popular place over the weekend. Try to book early on in the week or two ahead if you choose less Prime Time hours of dinner gatherings. If you have a big group, very wise to call ahead much earlier.   Food review- You have a lot of good choices of your regular sushi /sashimi options here. However, On a Friday weeknight when we were eating dinner, the owner came around to leave us with a complimentary order of the the torched specialties and it was SOOO delicious. When we wanted to eat and order another round of it ourselves, we were sad to know that it was not on the menu and only offered on weekend (of course, NEXT time we go..... we booked a weekend and ordered it).  As many reviews have listed, they are the only ALL you CAN eat sushi buffet places in markham that offer the TORCHED pressed sushi. I would say that I do enjoy the ACTUAL A LA CARTE torched pressed sushi from other popular Toronto restaurants like Jabistro and Miku (just to name my favourite), but as a BUFFET in Markham, this is pretty nice to be able to order it and eat all you want! Good plating for these pressed sushi --- doesn't really look like an ALL YOU CAN EAT buffet where they just make messy sushi pieces. It's quite decent.  Slowly, I realized that I enjoy eating quality and less QUANTITY now, so buffets are not really my thing. But I did enjoy eating here for the few times that I went with a group of people. There's a lot of food selection and quick service (you order through a tablet, therefore you can order and cancel your dishes, get as many rounds as you want, and not have to trouble the staff as Plates of food arrive at your table). LOVE high tech devices nowadays in restaurants!  Minus 1 star because it is more expensive in comparison to other all you can eat buffet (if the cost is more just because of their pressed sushi speciality, I rather eat a good quality plate of that at my other favourite Aburi restaurants). But, having it available to order here is a bonus for other fans of it.   I would come back here for another group dinner event."}
{"text":"Kaka used to be my absolute favourite ayce sushi restaurant, I would always bring friends here for their birthdays. I went back recently and to see the quality of food changing for the worse was such a disappointment :(  We were constantly giving plates they called \"house specials\" when we didn't order it, it was something they gave to everyone. I wish they didn't because my partner and I don't eat anything tuna and they gave us a tuna tataki I believe and we left it untouched which was such a waste of food. The other \"house special\" was salmon with a citric sauce and baked scallops (which I won't lie, I liked the scallops). I'm not sure if they're testing dishes to see if they should be added to their menu or not.  Secondly, they kept giving us orders that we didn't order from the menu and it happened many times.   Lastly, the crime brûlée is one of the reasons why I came back every time but this time it was soft and didn't seemed to be set yet and was just served.   Very disappointed in my visit to Kaka and I'm hesitant of returning"}
{"text":"Not a good experience .Pricey and nothing like I was expected .The service is okay but their foods are just normal nothing special...some deserts are unavailable .Will be my first and last visit ..."}
{"text":"Saturday lunch - $25.99/person, each order is 1 piece unless stated otherwise.  Some highlights:  Mushroom soup - creamy and delicious  Sushi and sashimi - quality was good for an AYCE  Torched sushi - it was something new and unique,  but wasn't as spectacular as expected  (maybe because of the high expectations coming in)  Dessert - most items were quite sweet.  I highly recommend the mango lychee slush and coconut Greek yogurt pudding.   Service is good and attentive.  They indicated the name of each item as they set the plates down which was greatly appreciated.  Food came quickly.  It's a place to try at least once."}
{"text":"Kaka is like Neo in the Matrix.  It's the chosen AYCE; the one and only AYCE, destined to rescue a society that's drowning in a sea of mediocre AYCEs.  Kaka has enlightened our society, revealing a whole different world of AYCE where they serve lamb skewers, pressed/torched sushi, and mango lychee slushies.  Before Kaka, the world was grey; the skies filled to the brim with clouds and a musty haze of particulate matter traversing our atmosphere in constant convection.    But on the 7th day, God created Kaka. And it was good.  Kaka parted the clouds to reveal a golden sun and indigo sky filled with perfectly marinated beef tongues and delectable poke bowls.  It cleansed the oceans, bringing forth fresh platters of sashimi and bowls of udon carbonara.  Finally, it has halted deforestation and other heinous acts, such as elephant poaching, allowing us to harvest the natural fruits of the earth and prepare the sacred desserts, green tea creme brule and lychee panna cotta.  Blessed be to the Kaka.  For he has brought humanity to eternal AYCE salvation. Amen."}
{"text":"Why is this place labelled All You Can Eat, when it doesn't even offer All You Can Eat during lunch hours? Very misleading! I came out of my way to get to this restaurant for a nice AYCE lunch, only to realize upon entering that they only offer AYCE for dinner.   Aside from the slightly false advertising, Kaka was pretty good. I had the torched sushi bento box and it was just enough to fill me up. I finished everything with no complaints. Standard prices, decent meal, and great service.   I still wish that there could have been an AYCE option though. With that being said, I probably would visit again just to try out their AYCE dinner menu!"}
{"text":"?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"We came here for a lunch experience, it was not all you can eat when you come here for lunch! Coming in here at 12:00pm, there weren't a lot of people for lunch, but in between 12:00pm to 2:00pm, many people came in (I supposed many people know it's not an all you can eat lunch). The environment was great - not too mention air conditioning was FREEZING for me, but just right for my friend. The tea was nice and hot to make up for the cold AC.   The food was a fair price - $10.99 for a HUGE portion of a Chicken Katsu bento box. It included a salad, a miso soup, shrimp and vegetable tempura (2 pieces of each, for a total of 4), a scoop of rice, about 15 pieces of chicken katsu (cut into strips) with cooked vegetables (zucchinis) places underneath, 3 large pieces of california roll and a nicely cut orange. The chicken katsu was very crispy and tender on the inside - I wish there was an option for sauce to dip the chicken in to make it a little less dry.  My friend ordered their Kaka maki rolls - it was their second one on the menu and it included california rolls and spicy salmon. These were very large pieces for $7.99. It tasted good for AYCE quality, but for the a la carte lunch menu, I expected a little more (for example, a tighter rolled maki with the rice packed more closely together) and the maki not falling apart while I'm eating it.   Overall, kaka was a good experience, the service and atmosphere was great. I would probably come back and try their AYCE becuase I do hear great things about it."}
{"text":"The service is very bad. The food is nothing special  All the table is crowd. It is small so need to reservation For me  just try once is enough"}
{"text":"2nd visits made and both during dinner.  First visit was last month and it was a 4 star experience. The rice was perfect and everything else on the menu was delicious, and service was also flawless minus a wait because the place is so popular.  Came back last night when it was just me and my girldriend and we knew to make a reservation this time. We got in right at the time we reserved and got a seat, 15 minutes went by before the hostess came back with the iPad and then we started our ordering. We had ordered some sushi rolls which didnt come and some we didnt order come by as well. They gave us like 3x od the special which we never ordered which was a salmon and tuna sashimi with a viniaigrette. The rice was too goopy on the maki rolls and had pretty bad texture. The sashimi was great but since we were then crowded with rolls we lost our appetite. The torched sushi wasnt even torched enough to give it that extra salty flavoyr boost. Itll take some other peoples good reviews to get me to come back. Kiku has been more consistent with their quality and have the same iPad system. Ill stick with them!"}
{"text":"I made sure to make reservations three weeks before I planned on going with a group of friends.  We were seated and given the iPad to order.  We chose the items we wanted and there was such a wide assortment of items at lunch time.  We found that they were fairly quick, however, quite a few of our items got lost in translation and never appeared.  The highlights were the baked oyster, the seared fish (salmon, tuna and shrimp) and their desserts.  Everything else was good but those were definitely the highlights.  Besides all the food we ate and we were there for a good two hours, the dessert made the whole thing worthwhile.  The lavender chocolate pot was to die for just rich and creamy.  The green tea creme brule was the best dish I had there.  Just the perfect combination of green tea mixed with my favourite dessert.  Absolutely loved it.  Not to mention the mango slush that you got.  I would say that despite that it's one of the best ayce that I have been too it was decent, but the forgetting of items and the price tag $37 for lunch was a bit steep.  You come for the experience and you get one."}
{"text":"More like a 3.5/5 :)  Make reservations or expect to wait!!! Came here at 8:30 on a Thursday and didn't end up getting a table until 9:45. Was told last call was at 10:30 but was very rushed to order. The server encouraged us to order a lot of food early, and we would not be charged for leftovers.   The service was very good and efficient for a place that just opened. Tables were quickly cleared and ready for new patrons. Other than feeling a bit rushed, our server was very cheerful and informative. He changed the iPad so that our order would not need to be confirmed by a server to be sent to the bar/kitchen. Very efficient! Empty plates were quickly taken. Food came out very quickly. Not sure if it's because we were dining late but the food came out in no order (ie appetizers were not served first). Only my salad was forgotten out of 54 items in total. Everything was accounted for, which can be a task for AYCE places.  Food was plated with extra care and overall made me feel like I wasn't gorging on all-you-can-eat sushi. The presentation of the food was superb but in the end, the actual food came out flat.   I was very excited to dig into the torched rolls and sushi, however the rice was very \"sour\" from the rice vinegar. I loved the size of the rolls, just perfect for AYCE. The amount of rice was appreciable (I always peel off rice at AYCE so I can eat morex3). Nothing special about the makis. Sashimi was very fresh. Beef carpaccio could use a little more sauce. Only went for seconds on the pressed torched sushi. The kitchen food was decent but I found it went cold quickly. The grilled vegetables were drizzled in grease. The lamb skewers were delicious. The seafood udon was chewy and lots of flavour.   Overall, I'd come back here if I had reservations. Was very excited to see what all the hype was about. Would recommend Kaka for their atmosphere, service and presentation."}
{"text":"**Johhny L** thanks for introducing me to this gem!!This place is has all the ingredients needed for a good dining experience and a solid 3.5 stars,  KAKA is located in s strip mall in Markham it seems pretty small from outside but as you walk in this place is fairly decent in size and nicely done.  So I went here on a weeknight initially I was a bit hesitant to go here since it's an hour drive from Mississauga to Markham and mind you at 6/7pm it can be a quite \"A\" challenge but Stephanie S's kind offer to take me with her made this happen.  So we were a party of 12 food loving people.The ordering here is done through iPad which is quite fast and accurate.We ordered in large quantities and shared between us.  Among the items ordered I thoroughly enjoyed all the torched sushi.They were perfectly assembled and topped with fresh meats/fish and some were lathered with sauces and some with jelly.The torch effect gave it an outstanding smokey flavor to it with was not very overpowering to the tastebuds.  We ordered shrimp and vegetables tempura, the shrimp ones were crispy and pretty standard but the vegetables ones I found were a tad bit greasy.  Other items we ordered included ribs, sushi, sashimi, noodles, fish, chicken karage and a few others.  Now coming to the cons I thought their desert menu wasn't too exciting they did have quite a few deserts on board but most all were OK none blew my tastebuds away.Only the mango lychee slush I thought maybe worth a mention!  Service was a bit haphazard and I think it was mainly because we were ordering in larger quantities..I would love to come back here again and experience it again in a smaller setting.  I definitely see myself coming here again just because I really enjoyed the food here."}
{"text":"3.5/5 I came here twice and both times reservations were required. I'm not really sure how long the wait is for walk-ins, but I'm assuming it's long.  When we sat down, they provided us with a \"complimentary\" platter, filled with a variety of specialty torched sushi not found on the menu. Smart move on their part because these specialty rolls filled us up RIGHT AWAY. They jam their torched sushi with a lot of rice and there's some kind of creamy sauce that just makes it even more filling.  Since most of us try to take advantage of the AYCE aspect, an uncomfortable feeling will begin to trickle in if you eat too many of those torched sushi.   Overall the food is pretty good, one of the better tasting AYCE in Toronto. The price is on the higher side of other AYCE places but I guess they can charge whatever since they are so popular. I would go back but control the amount of torched sushi I inhale."}
{"text":"Have heard a lot about this premium ayce place, so finally gathered up a group to come try the place.   To call and make reservations for this place is horrendous.  First time we called and was on hold for 15 minutes and had to hang up to get back to work. Second time was for 20 minutes to finally get a spot! The only one left was 9pm saturday.  I've seen a lot of people complaining about the reservation process, I think they need to change something.    We got there around 8:45 as they were clearing a whole bunch of tables at once to seat the 9:00 seating.  They seated everybody and cleared everybody that was waiting in the front, those who didn't have reservations had to leave because there were no extra tables available.   Once seated we were given an iPad, and told how to do the ordering, and were told there would be a platter of special sushi.    When the special sushi arrived, we had 5 people. Some have 5 pieces some had 4. I had to ask the waitress if we were supposed to get 5 pieces each, and she counted in front of me and asked what I am talking about.  Then she realized there were 2 pieces missing and said she will ask the chef to make another 2.  The spring egg is pretty good, the tempura vegetable and shrimp were nice and hot.  The pork belly skewer were dry and not very good.  The skewers in general were nothing special.   The box sushi and torched sushi were good.  Just stick with these.  The seared beef roll and sushi were our favourites.   By 10pm they came by and told us this is last call.  We just got to eat 1 hour and they told us one more order then our iPad would be taken away.  I asked if this includes desserts because I didn't want my ice cream melting, they said yes.  So we had to order everything and have it just sitting on the tables.  I looked around and everybody had their tables packed with food.    Their slushies were pretty good.  But didn't get to try some desserts on their menu.  We would order them, then ask after they didn't come.  And was told they don't have any.   I know we had our reservations very late, but definitely didn't appreciate paying $40.00 a person including tax and tip, and eating an hour then being rushed out.   Another thing mentioned by someone on yelp, their spoons don't reach to the bottom of their desserts for slush and yogurts.  Need slightly bigger shot glasses.    Not sure if I'd come back, maybe for a 7pm dinner hour.   3 stars for the food (unique torched sushi and pressed sushi)"}
{"text":"I use to come here all the time.  I even took my girlfriend here for Valentines day and it was the best.  I even spent my birthday dinner here with my family 2 years in a row and half of them are vegans but it's my birthday and I can cry if I want to.  However, I'm definitely not coming back here because the food was damn disgusting.  The chicken teriyaki was from a scale of 1 to salmonella, undercooked.  The takoyaki was more like takoyucky.  The fried shrimp still had their shells and it was soaked in a sauce.  You are suppose to drizzle it, not bathe the shrimp.  The sushi rolls were mostly cucumbers and I love sushi so much that I would look over the fact that I hate cucumbers.  In fact, I hate cucumbers more than I hate people who intentionally wear socks with their sandals but this sushi might as well been called cucumber sushi with eel seasoning.  Have you ever licked a cars tire? Well I have and don't ask me why but some of that sushi tasted like rubber that I spat it out.  I'm the type of person who drops his delicious ice cream on the beach and still eats it, sand and all but some of that rice was so hard that it would've made my Filipino momma pray to Jesus before wildly throwing her flip flops.  I should've known from the start the minute I sat down and saw the wasabi was browning.  Actually browning like when someone makes too much guacamole and it gets left out too long.  I know that wasabi is made from a powder so how hard is it to make green wasabi?  Never in my 15 year of sushi eating career have I ever seen browning wasabi and never have I ever left an ayce sushi place still hungry and not in a food coma.  Here I came thinking to myself, I just did 2 hours of chest and I'm about to eat all this to fuel my gains but alas it was a wasted effort.  I thought eating sashimi would give me ample protein but it was discolored and made my poopy discolored.  I thought whatever, they cannot mess up on dessert but the waiter comes and hands me the mango slushi with his fingers in it.  He ran to the back thinking I wouldn't catch that but nothing escapes me.  The red bean ice cream tasted like licorice.  I hate licorice more than I hate cucumbers.  Basically Kakas managed to bring 2 of my top 3 hated things and put it in my mouth. I would give it 1 star since the location is great and the waitresses do work hard but in all honesty, I'm afraid to reccomend this place to my friends.  They will downvote me harder than the time Star Wars decided to give make Rey overpowered.  This place is as the French would say \"kaka\".  Translation = poop."}
{"text":"Great assortment of rolls and sushi! Best sushi buffet I've been in Scarborough/ Markham area so far!"}
{"text":"You can't really go wrong with AYCE blow torched sushi. The Ebi pressed sushi was my favourite.   The markup here compared to other sushi AYCE restaurants is definitely well justified. In addition to the blow torched sushi, there's also many unique dishes such as ox tongue with mashed potatoes (definitely worth trying) and mango slush for dessert.   Service is similar to any other AYCE, servers are generally pretty rushed, trying to fill orders. There is always the \"why is it taking so long\" during your second/third order of sashimi. Nothing beyond my expectations.   Overall verdict: Drooling as I write this review and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"there is not much food option to choose and the deep fry food and tempura are so oily, there only three fish option for the sashimi and all the raw sea foods are not fresh but dry. not recommended doesn't worth the price"}
{"text":"Tried with some friends last night.   The daily special is ok.   But the others are so so.  Maybe hold your breath."}
{"text":"This place is very good considering it is an all you can eat Japanese restaurant. The server was friendly and food was served very fast after we ordered. The blowtorched sushis are their signature dishes, so it's a must try. And their other selections are not bad too. It's my third time eating here. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"-iPad ordering. Small portions. Appropriate + nice plating. Fresh sashimi. Innovative items-  Definitely really surprised by the quality of the food for an AYCE japanese restaurant. I would 100% recommend this place. The place looks bigger from the outside, but really they have limited tables.   They have many innovative items and even some items that are not common on other average AYCE places. Their plating is very proper and approrpiate for the amount of food. The portion sizes are one of my favourite things about Kaka, which is that they're small so you can try everything.   The staff are also very polite and friendly. The food also comes really quickly (finished eating in little over an hour). Some personal favourites: torched sushi, box-shaped sushi, grilled ox tongue, sashimi, dark chocolate pudding, creme brulee.  *recommend to book table beforehand just in case."}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to eat at Kaka. This is a restaurant I would recommend a reservation.   The first time I stopped by around 6 pm and I was still waiting for a seat at 7:30pm.  With that said, the food here is great but what puts this place over the top is the toched sushi.  Definitely one of the best all you can eat places to visit in Markham!"}
{"text":"Though it says \"all you can eat\", they actually have a good selection of lunch bento boxes.  The torched sushi tastes really good with a touch of the \"torch\" taste along with the fresh fish!  Quite surprising to see this available as a lunch special-the taste is pretty close to some \"high end\" places as a reasonable price.  If you are really hungry or have a big appetite do not order the sushi combos without ordering something else since it will not be enough...tastes good and is fresh but I did not find it filling enough.   However the Salmon combo was great value and would be filling.   Very comfortable ambiance and good service rounded out my meal.....gotta try the dinner all you can eat next time!"}
{"text":"I would probably give Kaka AYCE a rating of 3.5. Came here with family for lunch over the Family Day weekend. My sister in law was fortunate enough to get a reservation on 2 days notice as I've heard a reservation of several days to a week is needed for dinner here.  First impression, the restaurant had a nice clean modern vibe with slick bentwood textured walls and dark bench seat seating.   They give you an iPad to select items from the menu. For many of the orders, you get one piece per order so something to keep in mind. There were also several items not available during lunchtime, such as the lavender and jasmine creme brûlées, which was disappointing given the price of dinner and lunch is the same.  Unlike many other AYCE Japanese restaurants, it was nice to have items like sashimi or seaweed salad available on the lunch menu. The sashimi is fresh. They do a great job with their lamb skewers and beef short ribs as well. What sets them apart is the availability of torched and pressed sushi, which were well put together, delicious, and like nothing I've ever had before at a Japanese restaurant.   Truth be told, I seldom dine at AYCE places anymore due to tendency to overindulge. However Kaka offered more than the usual options. It does come with a heftier price tag, so if you've got your heart set to try all that their menu offers, you may be better off planning ahead and making a reservation a week in advance to dine at this restaurant for dinner. As for me, having tried this place once, I'm not likely do go back unless we have sushi-loving out of town guests looking to try something unique.  (9/100)"}
{"text":"A delicious AYCE and recommended place to eat! They have wide selections of appetizers, sushi and seafood. My favorite is honey mustard special sushi, torched sushi, salmon belly and save your tummy for their desserts too! Worth the money! The sushi and seafood shrimps are fresh!"}
{"text":"Very crowded place, wait time is too long for dinner, the price is too high, the food is not spectacular, probably will not go back. Sorry but not sorry. The so called \"high price point\" is definitely not worth the so called \"torched\" or \"pressed\" sushi or \"premium\" AYCE offerings or anything for that matter."}
{"text":"Been hearing rave reviews for this place for months and wanting to try it out so badly. Went in for a friend's birthday for dinner today, and it wasn't what I expected it to be. Some of the foods were quite tasty but overall, I was still disappointed by their foods. The sushi weren't as delicious as I thought it would be (they look much better on their website). They were quite quick with the first round of order, like most foods came after 5-10 minutes of ordering. But... the second time around, the wait time for the order was much longer. Honestly, I have had better all you can eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"it's alright, acoustics of the place is horrible so forget about being able to have a conversation and just stuff your face.  while torched is interesting the novelty wears off after one round,  and service slows to a crawl,  slightly more pompous with price to match,  once is enough for me.  also when booking lady was extremely rude"}
{"text":"Heard about this place and had to reserve weeks before. Came here on a Saturday and nothing special. Don't even know what's the hype about this place is just the ordinary AYCE sushi like anywhere else. It is overrated and overpriced for no reason. I can get the same food with better quality at other AYCE place."}
{"text":"Without a doubt Kaka is the best all you can eat Japanese restaurant I have ever been to. The quality of not only the food, but the customer service was leaps and bounds above everyone else.  I should start off by saying we ordered items that are unique to Kaka, so we avoided the sashimi (I can't believe I only ate one piece of sashimi at a dinner AYCE - it wasn't anything special anyways), and tended to order the more unique, and premium options.   I'll just start off with the good: the house special nigiri platter at the beginning of the meal was phenomenal, especially the unagi (?) and scallop - melt in your mouth goodness. I came in with great hopes for their poke bowls and can say all three of their poke bowls were actually excellent, well dressed and a good combination of flavours - a huge plus for not having so much rice in those small bowls! All of the blow-torched sushi and their pressed sushi were also great. For dessert, the matcha creme brulé was excellent.  The downside is that a lot of their regular Izakaya items weren't anything special and tended to be on the oily side, so just a word of caution. I should also add that a lot of their sushi were quite 'sauced up', so I didn't bother with the soy sauce.  I have heard a lot of things about their service and it seems that it can be a hit or miss but we shall see what happens in future visits to this place because customer service was incredibly polished. We came in without a reservation at 6pm (an earlier call revealed they were all booked) but despite the fact, we were still seated and quickly too, as long as we finished before the next reservation. We were explained everything in the beginning (I.e quantity of some the orders and the iPad system), and were given ample time to eat - 6:30 - 8pm. Food came out quickly and accurately, as there we no incorrect orders. Empty plates were picked up frequently and the tea refilled without asking. We were notified of the last call and were well taken care of!   Value was fair considering the quality of an AYCE place. I won't be coming here often but a once in a while treat or craving for AYCE should suffice."}
{"text":"It took like 45 minutes for us to get seated. When we got in (around 8:15 pm), the restaurant was packed. There were a number of servers so the restaurant wasn't understaffed. When we sat down, there was no iPad menu for us and we were missing a napkin and one chopstick. Took another 10 minutes to alert a server about the missing items. The food came by fairly quickly after placing the first order but we've noticed that half of our orders did not come at all. A group of six sat next to us and we've noticed that they got food almost immediately. Many of the items that they've received were what we ended up ordering! The table next to us kept asking, \"Did we order this!?\" but proceeded to eat our orders anyway. When we flagged down one of the servers again to let them know about our missing orders (there was a 20 minute gap when we did not have any food), they realized that they've messed up and confirmed that our food did in fact go to the party of six!! Party of six just sat there, stared at us, continued to stuff their faces and did not admit that they were eating our food. We finally received most of our missing food (we never got our baked mussels for some reason).  Food was less than average, both in terms of quality and quantity. There was literally one item per order (we ordered takoyaki balls and thought it would come in two like the photo did. It was literally just one ball). The food did not taste all that great either. Everything was either very greasy or had too much rice. I would say that the seaweed salad was the best dish - for whatever reason, it was done better than most seaweed salads. Visitors beware - photos are there to catfish the customers. They do not necessarily represent the actual orders themselves.  Despite the mess ups and the long waits, the hostess and our servers were extremely patient, very apologetic and handled our situation well. We got a 10% discount for the mess ups and the long waits. If it weren't for the staff's patience, KaKa would've gotten a one star."}
{"text":"Best AYCE I've had in awhile. Why have i strayed from this place for so long. I've been missing out. We order from tablets so that's a bonus point - each roll lists out what's in it. Convenience is key in these kinda places.   Y'all know the drill so I'll just tell you what's exceptionally goood: Baked Oyster with Cheese, Marinated Shiitaki Mushroom, Salmon and Jalapeno with Spicy Mayo, Beef Tataki Torched Sushi, Mango Lychee Slush, Earl Grey Milk Ganache Square  There's a premium aburi platter with 4 different nigiris that each table shares at the beginning. It's included in the AYCE and it's so tasty. The scallop sushi especially is just amazing.  I don't really like sake, or alcohol for that matter, but my friends and I went for the MIO Sparkling Sake (~$20) which already tastes sweet on its own, but even better with their blowtorched sushi.  CHECK IN ON YELP FOR FREE POP!"}
{"text":"I waited for about an hour to get in, so make a reservation! The price is higher than your average AYCE (about $40) but the quality makes it worth it.  They have perfectly torched sushi, and creative rolls. Fish was fresh, and tasted great! I was pleasantly surprised.   I especially loved the desserts; they were all very small, and I tried almost all of them. Perfect end to a meal!"}
{"text":"One of those places where you need to make a reservation and it always seems to be booked up at regular meal times and difficult to get a hold of on the phone. Their service is mediocre but thats a regular asian restaurant type for you. I have tried to walk in a few times and the hostesses have attitude when you don't make a reso. So we ended up with a table for 2 at the bar for dinner at 5.30pm. The ipad system is easy to use and avoids you from having to speak to the wait staff.   But the food is better than most AYCE out there. The house platter was given to us at the beginning. The scallop sushi on there was definitely good and felt fresh. the house platter sushi was also attractive with garnishes on each piece. The torched sushi was also the best part and adds a good smokiness to the fish. The hot cooked food was mediocre though nothing amazing, felt pre-made. Either way better than most places but still hyped up for a slightly more expensive AYCE meal."}
{"text":"There was too many kinks in a $80 dinner for two to justify more than a one star review.  The food was above average. The fusion flavours were innovative and interesting. Our favourites dishes were the squid aburi, the shrimp aburi and chef Frank's roll. Our least favourites were the chicken wings (they were ice cold!!!), the beef cubes (they were cooked to a perfect well done and therefore inedible) and all the dishes we had ordered that never showed up (takowasa, salmon sashimi, oishi, half of the dessert menu...)   The service so bad that I have no words to describe it. We showed up at 5pm and there was one single server serving a full house restaurant... We received 50% of our orders and 20% of the items we ordered were \"out of stock/sold out\" on a Saturday night at 5:30pm. We also had to order 3 times after the first two orders failed to show up (turns out they were never entered into the system and we were never notified of anything).  The funniest part was when we ordered dessert, our server comes and brings us half our order telling us that this was all he could get for us... Does kaka have its own definition of ayce?  Three hours (including 2:30 hours of waiting) into our meal, we decided we had enough of it and asked for the bill. Funny enough, the tables next to us all got 15% off for soft opening but we got 10%... Does that mean the table after us will only get 5% ?"}
{"text":"Amazing food, but awful service. The food was fantastic! Plenty of interesting new things and I definitely recommend the presses and torches sushi! Very original. However, as soon as we came in we were told we had 1.5 hours to eat.  We were again instantly reminded of this when we sat at our table... to the point that the server showed us the time on the iPad and advised us of what time we had to be out of there. 45 minutes into our meal the server came over and told us we had a 5 minute warning until our last call... she came by again 5 minutes later and took our iPad because our time was up! We asked her about why she was in such a hurry to get rid of us when there were still empty tables and we were given less than the hour and a half, we were told that you are only allowed to order for 1 hour, and then given an extra half hour to sit."}
{"text":"Everything you need to know is already written in other's reviews.   This is a standard AYCE place, with a few more high quality offerings that make it stand out. If you like Oshizushi and Japanese apps, its the place for you. But if you like good quality fish, good quality rice and a pleasant, slow paced experience, this is not for you (granted most people dont go to AYCE for the things I just mentioned).   I really liked that they offered most of their dishes in small portions. With AYCE, its great to try 2 or 3 pieces of a roll and move on to another option, as supposed to having 6 or 8 pieces per order. Kaka makes this a reality with all of their dishes and they arent shy about you ordering 8,9,10 or more orders of a single item.   Food flows in fast, the ordering system is efficient and pleasant and they are quick with water, tea, ginger and wasabi refills.   Is it worth the extra cost - yes if you are into non fish dishes. No, if you are looking for AYCE with higher quality items.   Would I come back - no. Was I happy I tried it - yes!"}
{"text":"The best sushi all u can eat ever??I really like the desserts~ Everything is fresh and tasty?My favourtie is the roasted okra ?"}
{"text":"You pay for what you get. The quality is really good ! $28.99 went on a Thursday and it was quite busy . Their press sushi is really good !"}
{"text":"Kaka is one of those restaurants that is so hyped up by everyone around you, that you can't help but be disappointed when you actually try it.  We have all seen photos of their pressed and torched sushi on insta or snapchat, but upon trying it, I realized it was nothing special. There were 6 different flavours, 3 torched and 3 pressed, but honestly it tastes like MAYO ON RICE. Did I enjoy the mayo on rice? Possibly, but I did not may the $28.99 price tag for MAYON ON RICE, so I switched over to the special maki rolls.  The two that interested me was the honey mustard shrimp and beef tataki, they showed up lukewarm. The honey mustard one was saucy, which made it better, but at the same time worse. Ya feel?  The appetizers (squash soup, spring poached egg, and tofu, mussels) were delicious, and dessert was interesting as well, but the highlight of the meal was the sashimi! I loved the butterfish and salmon sashimi, great quality.  But is sashimi enough to get me to turn to Kaka? Probs not.   To me, it's just one of those places you have to try once."}
{"text":"We finally had an opportunity to try this place and made a reservation. Overall it is your typical AYCE with nicer decor. You have some items that are good, others not so much...very typical AYCE. I particularly liked the torched items, chocolate mousse, and the noodle soups were very tasty. Service was quite good so no complaints there.  Be careful as we did find a finger nail in our dessert. They did offer to take 10% off the bill but I pushed to remove the child off the bill. In retrospect, they should have taken the adult who found the nail in the dessert but they didn't make a big stink about it so we were okay with it.   We came during lunch on a Saturday and made a reservation. We didn't need one but I see this place is usually very busy so I'd recommend you make a reso so you don't have to wait forever."}
{"text":"Kaka sushi has a large menu with quite a bit of good selection. Skeptical at first because of the reviews, I decided to give this place a try anyways since  I had another friend that enjoyed the sushi here.   Although the sushi price is a tad higher (34.99 lunch & dinner price), I thought it was worth the price. I would say the sushi definitely tasted better than most ayce sushi joints in the downtown core and the service was quite fast. I'm guessing those that complained about slow service were probably individuals that ate here around the grand opening date.    Overall, I enjoyed the sushi and dessert menu here as well as the service I received. I will return to Kaka in the near future :)"}
{"text":"Was great. Not so any more.  Kaka started off as a Japanese all you can eat with some fresh ideas and great execution of those fresh ideas.  The food was a notch above the rest, their deserts were wonderful, and the tasting platter was pretty amazing.  This was around the time they opened up in First Markham.  *** Fast Forward 2016 ***  Deserts have sunk to the standard stuff that you can get ANYWHERE ELSE.  It's not that they just kept things the same and everyone else caught up, it's that KaKa's desserts got smaller, less variety and generally poorer in quality.  The cheesecake I always looked forward to shrunk by half, and there are no toppings(crust crumbles, fruit jams,) on it anymore.  Just plain cheese cake with a berry.  Food is still good, but other ayce places have similar items now.  The overall quality and care of with their food seemed to have dropped which gives less and less of a reason to choose Kaka over another ayce.  I hope it picks back up, but at the moment there really isn't any reason to choose KaKa over another ayce."}
{"text":"This review is way overdue.  I came to Kaka on 3 separate occasions already and on my first visit, I was super impressed with the quality of food they offer in an All You Can Eat (AYCE) Japanese environment. I came here once on weekday dinner and twice during the weekend for dinner.  Weekend dinner is more expensive, however, they do give you a plate of Chef Specials which contains 4 kinds of sushi from Chef's choice.  Each kind has one piece per person at your table.  I think what makes Kaka really stands out from all the other AYCE Japanese places is they serve a fusion sushi call the Aburi sushi, which sushi with seared (blow-torched) fish on top.  I am always impress with blow-torched (Aburi) sushi because the minor seared brings out the oil within the fish, and with nice pairing sauce, it taste that much more unique and better than your regular sushi (nigiri).  This AYCE makes their aburi sushi pretty good so it's a MUST order!!  In terms of other sushi beside their aburi (blow-torched), they are just regular and nothing too special.  They do taste decent though.  Their sashimi is also very fresh and is thick cut, which is a plus for a AYCE place as well!  Hot food, I highly recommend the Carbonara, it is SOO good!! Sauce and pasta are both fantastic!  Other hot food i would recommend is their fried scallops and garlic shrimp.  Desserts, similar to Ten-ichi, this place has a LOT of variety, I do not have anything particular i really like in the dessert menu because I am always super full by the time i get to this section of the menu.  But if you got room left, go with the two creme brulee they offer, both are well done.  For an AYCE Japanese restaurant, this one is all the way up there as top in Toronto.  Only downfall is, this place is fully book ALL the time, if you got a large group (4 or more), you better book 3 weeks in advance (YES THREE WEEKS!)."}
{"text":"Worst All-You-Can-Eat sushi experience ever! We were here by 6:30 on a Wednesday to try and get a table for 4 for 8:00pm, because they restaurant wouldn't pick up calls for reservations... When we came back again at 7:50pm they said our table is not going to be ready until 9pm, because that's just what they told us the first time. So we left and at 8:15 they called us to come back.   Food was very very bad, the beef tataki was cut so thick and was plated like it was just old and Raw super market raw meat :(   Fried tofu skewers were bad.. The tofu has gone sour. Lamb skewers were hot on the outside and cold like they didn't reheat properly.  There was so many other bad food.."}
{"text":"First time going to KaKa. I had gone with 6 other people on a weekday for dinner. It was very full for 6pm on a weekday.   The ordering system is straight forward and fast. You write down the number the item is listed as on the menu and the quantity you want to order. Service was fast, they take the order in and food comes out within few minutes. They attended to us right when we asked for something.   The sushi was pretty good for all you can eat. The pressed aburi sushi was my favourite. As for the cooked foods - the flavour was only okay. The chicken wings had good flavour but they were very small. The chicken karaage was so small! It was more like popcorn chicken. Definitely not like your typical izakya chicken karaage . The sashimi tasted pretty fresh for all your can eat, except the butter fish tasted like it was frozen and unthawed as it tasted very wet. The shrimp and veggie tempura was fresh and huge portions. They listed 4 different veggies but only gave us 2 (yam and eggplant). Not sure if they actually had the other ones. But the batter was light and flavourful and the you could tell the oil was fresh.   There were tons of options and items that I did not get to try. But also there were quite a few items on the menu that was not available to order.   The desserts they had were good and had so many different choices. I tried the green tea creme brûlée, pana cotta, kaka ice cream and the truffle. The first three were unique and tasted good and not overly sweet. The textures of the brûlée and panacotta were pretty accurate in my opinion. The truffle on the other hand was nothing special it was one piece of chocolate and tasted just like store bought ones.   Overall you get a good variety of items. The special sushi rolls and aburis were unique and very tasty. The other items are pretty standard and what you'd kind of expect at all you can eat. I would say it is worth it if you're wanting to eat more sushi rather sashimi."}
{"text":"Walking into any all you can eat restaurant, you enter with some embedded perception that the quality is going to be average at best. I'd say Kaka fits into this, with the quality of food being a bit below average.   Portion sizes were, personally, mind-bogglingly small. I believe each order of nigiri was one piece, special rolls came with two, and regular rolls with three, though I'm not entirely certain.   Sushi was okay, soups were a bit too salty, other entrees, like the udon, were okay as well. The time it took the staff to bring out our food was a bit lengthy, which is understandable. The menu and ordering process was all done through a tablet, which is very convenient and efficient.   I would not get out of my way to come back and have this food. If you're looking for quality food, then I think there are other places that do it better"}
{"text":"Updating to three stars...Customer service responded, which I appreciate.    \"Hi Johnny, We are sorry that our food is not up to your standard. Please accept apologies regarding above issue. We already report to the management office, were you there yesterday? Your opinion is important to us! Your sincerely, KaKa all you cane eat customer service\"  This is what restaurants should do to better themselves if a negative comment has been reported.  This is truly a satisfactory response.  For Kaka All You Can Eat...Please do ensure that whatever food is supposed to be hot remain hot such as the fried dishes which we ordered this Saturday.  I know that you are a busy establishment but management should have better coordination of their employees.  I wish you the best of success.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Tuesday night right when they opened up - we called in advance as we heard this place was really busy and required a months reservation in advance - someone picked up my call right away and said if I make it there before 4:45 then I can be seated as starting from 5 o'clock they were fully booked. We got there at around 4:50 and the restaurant began to get busy at 6 closer to 7 o'clock it was almost a full house. The servers were very friendly towards the beginning and attentive but towards the end the service became less frequent. Having tried a lot of all you can eat sushi places in Markham I really recommend this one - although it is a little bit pricey for dinner it was really worth it and the setting was extremely beautiful! I Would definitely be back when the craving for sushi comes back!"}
{"text":"Rating: 2.5  This was such a hyped place but dang I was so disappointed. I think at this point, any place that's like hyped af, I'm most likely not gonna like sadly. -*tears*  Went here for lunch thinking there was AYCE, but sadly there wasn't. Apparently it was only for dinners which is quite a bummer. I always had the impression it was both lunch and dinner. :/   Anyways, the restaurant itself was not as big as I thought. No wonder it's always booked. Such a small place lol. The interior is cool though.   Food wise, I ordered the Seafood Ramen and Salmon and Jalapeño with Spicy Mayo. The ramen was okay. The broth was not too salty which is always great and the noodles were to my liking. I just didn't like their egg. Usually the eggs are supposed to be either hard-boiled or half-boiled but it was way too raw for me. Like the egg whites were like jelly-like. That's gross ....... For the seafood part, it's alright. They were pretty generous with the shrimp. As for the mussels and narutos, I only got one of each which I don't know. Maybe i'm just a diva ass punk but, I kinda wished there was at least two of each. LOOL  As for the torched sushi thing I ordered, that was disgusting. I got it because I read that a lot of people liked it...but dear god it's not for me. The flavours just don't match and it was even confusing. For some odd reason, it had an orangey taste which is like o___O wut?! I absolutely HATE WHEN FOODS HAVE AN ORANGEY TASTE LIKE WHY BRUH WHY   After eating here today, I don't really think I'm gonna spend over $30 (or however ever much it is) for the AYCE. Like nah mate nAhh"}
{"text":"My husband and I received a make up dinner by the management which was outstanding. The management did an outstanding job correcting the issue and we both had an outstanding experience. The food was epic especially the weekend specials. Thank you for dinner and we will be back again!"}
{"text":"I can't say here is the best Japanese restaurant I ever been. But this is the best quality / price place I had."}
{"text":"Definitely a nice experience. Service was fast. Food came in small portions so we could try everything. Their specialty items are pretty good and have distinct flavors. Didnt really take pictures of everything but there are lots of choices. Worth going through the menu to taste items of interest. Really liked the salad with octopus and seaweed, pressed sushi with salmon, and kani in the sashimi"}
{"text":"I don't like being rushed out especially after sitting there for only an hour... and also waiting for missed orders still (happened a few times).. they need to tell people how long the sitting time is so that people can prepare for it and not be surprised by the waiter coming in and telling us, we have many people waiting and therefore,  you feel u need to leave soon..   it helps if you know the staff and people working there.. THe service is quite Different!!    If the food does not come out within 5 to 7 minutes, it means they have missed the order..even though I am not sure how it is that possible with their IPad ordering  the Manager hostess is quite annoying and rude in the sense she would badger her waiters to get the patrons to leave.. or force them to leave after an hour.. she would be like, Billy, why those people still at the bar sitting there..   Billy, the 7:30pm reservation is here..  blah blah blah..   The lobster bisque is great and it always come rite away when you order.. some of the items were not clear on how much it would come out.. I order fried calamari and only selected qty 1 and literally only one piece came out LOL   place is small and reservations is definitely a must.. unless u want to try walking in and sit at the bar...   Would I go back? unless there is a special, I am not sure...."}
{"text":"Of all the sushi restaurants I have been, I have to admit that this is one of the best, if not the best.   We made reservation 3 weeks before and got seated right away. Service was fast, given that the place was packed.   Every single dish was beautifully handcrafted.  The blow torched sushi was as good as the reviews indicated, and perhaps the centre of attraction.   Waitresses were all busy, but very polite and courteous, which made our dinner even more enjoyable.    Definitely a must try experience."}
{"text":"Came here once again cause friends suggested . With a party of 10 they didn't even put us together put us in separate booth and still charged both tables for mandatory tip. We had 4 people at our table. On top of which when we ordered second time the waitress just came over and told us that was it. Although we didn't get none of our dessert and udon etc. It was near last call, but it isn't closed yet. So we ended up having to order some things twice, which is where all the extra stuff came from.. And best part is they were going to charge us for that too. The waiter and waitresses was giving us dirty looks the whole time cause we ordered too much. I mean we understand the wasting policy you don't have to give us that kind of attitude.   I noticed the attitude issue last time as well. The food was okay but with the service and the price combined doesn't add up. If it was for me I would not have paid the full service charge.."}
{"text":"From all the reviews about poor service, I came with the expectation that service will be slow. We were seating fairly quickly, but service was slow. took a while before an available waiter came over to take our orders, and a looooonng time before food arrive. I think they run out of the more popular desserts early on. If service time does not improve, I would recommend getting desserts first as it seems to take less time to come out. We had ordered maybe 3 rounds of items before less than half of items ordered from the first round arrived. We did not have the issues with missing orders or wrong orders, its just coming out really really agonizingly slowly. It is not encouraging that waiters bring out trays of sushi and they are not for your table. On the plus side, the wait staff are really understanding and will help double check with you to see if everything arrived.  The food is delicious. It is on par with the KaKa at Markham. Torched sushi are perfect. It has the perfect amount of fish, sauce, rice.  This is definitely not the place to go if you're in a time crunch, but if you got time to spare, the food is more than worth it."}
{"text":"Came Here For A Thursday Dinner With The fam. The selection is a lot smaller compared to the menu on the website, however the sashimi was fresher than most other ayce places and doesn't have the frozen fish taste. The selection of desert was delightfull, but I found the mango serbet thing to be too tart and tanic. A word of advice avoid the torch sushi or anything torched, I may have came on a bad day but every torched item tasted of raw propane, probaly from a torch with a dirty flame."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with my family. We had made reservations and were promptly seated. Once we were seated we were given an iPad to order with. However, since we were a rather large group (11 people), a single iPad did not seem sufficient as only a couple people could be looking at the menu and ordering at a time. We asked for another iPad and they gladly gave us another one (I have no idea why they didn't just do this in the first place).   In terms of food, I thought the place was over hyped. I didn't think there was anything spectacular or particularly memorable about the food.   The service was alright. Not much to be expected since the waiters just bring you whatever you order from the iPad. Our waiter only sometimes said the name of the food on the plate he was bringing to us. I guess he just said it if he felt like it.   The restaurant itself was a lot smaller than I expected.   Would I come back? Maybe. The food wasn't bad but the place is quite pricy in my opinion and there are plenty of other options out there."}
{"text":"Probably the best AYCE sushi place I've ever been to. Both selection and service were excellent. I loved the torched sushi (especially beef) and the selection of desserts were really nice too. Most things came quick. The only thing that took a while was the baked avocado + cheese, but that's to be expected. Only downside is that it's incredibly popular right now so its hard to get a reservation unless you book way in advance, plus its a little pricey for dinner, but the selection makes it worth it."}
{"text":"Kaka used to be a 4.5-5 star AYCE sushi restaurant, but the quality and value for money has declined noticeably in the last year.   The menu used to include stuff you wouldn't the find at other AYCE places, like brussels sprouts and a tasty fish taco. The last two times we visited, those items were gone, and the menu was back to a typical AYCE one. Maybe we had a different chef/cook the last 2 times, but the food we did order also seemed lower in quality; maybe they changed their supplier too?  With this change in quality, there wasn't a change in price, which really bugs me. Kaka charges a pretty premium price for not so premium food."}
{"text":"My friends and I were really excited to try Kaka as we hear so many good reviews about this place, and I must say I was disappointed. Their aburi sushi was of unequal quality - some pieces tasted ok and others tasted burnt. The rest of the food was pretty average. Nothing was amazing nor worth coming back imo."}
{"text":"Never had blow torched sushi before, so this place blew my mind. The food came out pretty quick! The sashimi was fresh, and it was sliced thick. The lamb skewers are to die for. I love the spices that they put on it. Although, our waiter seemed to be rushing us out... even though several tables beside us came way before."}
{"text":"I had a lot of expectations for this place.  So much hype on social media that it made me and my sister in law excited to try this place.  Seriously...what's all the hype? And for $32.99+tax is not even worth it.   Yes I give them points for having different types of food on the menu but the flavors are not satisfying at all.  So many things were not available either.  If I'm paying $32.99, everything better be available.  The ox tongue had a texture of spam kind of, to be honest, I'd rather eat the spam than the ox tongue.  The torched white tuna or something like that tasted like a potted plant, not sure what vegetable they used for that but it was not pleasant on the tongue.  Ramen had no taste and soya sauce didn't help it either.  The udon had some sort of weird Chinese medicine taste, that was not pleasant either.  Ordered beef tataki and it came out the size of a dime.  The deep fried sushi came out cold!!  The caramel custard had some weird Ginger taste in it.   The sashimi was cut very small compared to the pictures posted on their instagram.  However, we enjoyed the oyster with cheese, octopus balls and the mango slush.  Overall, it was not worth it.  Probably won't be coming back, thank God I didn't have to line up for that, that would've been more disappointing.  Also, you will be timed on the dot.  Last call half an hour before your \"leave time\".  What dinner is enjoyable when they're timing you like that?"}
{"text":"Excellent ayce Japanese food. A little pricey but quality of food is amazing! Need to make reservations or you won't get a table."}
{"text":"Aburi sushi.    The Japanese term for blowtorched sushi that so many have raved and raved about this place.  Does it meet the mark? Is it all that it's cracked up to be? Or is it just another AYCE westernized sushi joint?    It comes close, but no cigar.  Situated next to where the much loved Congee Wong (now Chef Wong) once stood at First Markham Place, (and the site of an armed robbery once where cash was once king - no really, look it up it happened) Kaka is the new hot eatery where reservations are a must days if not weeks in advanced for large parties. Come here on any given evening including weekdays and you'll find a long line of patrons eagerly waiting their turn to try this place out.  Myself and 2 other companions were such people.  We came without a reservation, a moment of spontaneity to try our luck.    After 30 quick minutes, we were seated at the sushi bar. Our waitress ever so friendly with a smile promptly took our drink orders and handed us an iPad and in clear English, explained to us how the ordering system works. So far so good!  Your typical sushi buffet choices are all there, from cooked food stuffs to sushi rolls, sashimi, including yellowfin tuna that is becoming something of a rare offering at most AYCE places these days. Not surprising as the world's supply of tuna is rather becoming scarce these days due to overfishing.   Our first round consisted of a plethora of sashimi and sushi rolls, seaweed salad and miso soups and of course, the much talked about aburi sushi, the salmon, tuna and beef carpaccio style aburi.  One quick perusal of the dining room and we saw the tables were all full, with a legion forming at the waiting area.  Business is booming at Kaka!  Within 5 minutes our orders started trickling in. The staff hard at work behind the sushi bar counter, 4 sushi chefs manufacturing sashimi and rolls like their lives depended on it.    I must say - the sashimi were quite good, cut not too thinly and not too thick at the same time.  The salmon and California rolls were done to par, the sushi rice were prepared just right with the proper amount of vinegar and molded into just the right sized rolls that you could fit into your mouth with just one bite.   Finally, after a few more dishes - the first or 3 aburi sushi arrived.  First observation, it was quite small than what I'm used to seeing at higher end sushi restaurants. Second, the charred torching was done perfectly, and it looked delicious. The only other fault I could find was that the rice fell apart the moment you picked it up with your chopsticks.  A sign of rush preparation as the rice is not suppose to be that fragile to the touch.  A minor gripe; we can all look beyond that as it's already amazing that a buffet is offering aburi sushi.  For the value, Kaka offers a decent alternative to the bustling traditional Chinese fare ever so abundant at First Markham Place. Overall, in a region full of sushi buffets, Kaka is definitely up there in quality and the fast service.  Not one order was missed; a testament at the efficiency of the kitchen and the servers.  Often, at other sushi buffets, orders mysteriously never come to fruition. Not here at Kaka.  I'd recommend this place to others without hesitation, Kaka despite the complaints from others about the reservation mishaps, or the long lines - is place worth waiting at least 30 minutes for and worth trying at least once.    It will be worth noting to see how this place does a few months to a year from now, will the quality stay up there or slip downward like so many other sushi buffets in the area? Only time will tell.    For now, hurry and check out Kaka where high quality fish and fast efficient service is the norm!  It's no JaBistro or Sushi Kaji, but it'll satisfy sushi lovers everywhere - if you can get a table that is!   Cheers!"}
{"text":"Last time I came here a few months ago, Kaka offered a variety of good prepared dishes and raw fish menu items (sashimi, sushi, etc.). Overall, it's a great place to go for FMP if you're looking to go somewhere with a group."}
{"text":"My second visit to Kaka definitely made up for the unfortunate dining experience I had during my first visit. service this time around was MUCH better, some orders took a while to come out but nothing atrocious like the first time. My favourite was probably Chef Frank's roll... and the desserts were extremely tasty, especially the green tea creme brulee and the dark chocolate custard-- make sure to leave some room for dessert!"}
{"text":"I'm not particularly a fan of AYCE as I think quality always suffers.  Well I have to say this is one of the best AYCE sushi places that I have been to.  Located in Markham it looks like a small place from the outside (located in a plaza) but the inside it so well done and larger than I anticipated.  I went with a large group of friends - about 12.  You definitely need to make a reservation as there are line ups at the door.    Our table I think pretty much ordered everything on the menu...there were probably over 125 orders coming (when they say 1 order of something...it's 1 order - 1 roll, 1 tempura (unless otherwise indicated on the menu) so order multiples if you are in a large group.  From noodles, to rolls, sashimi to Korean ribs to tempura....everything was yum!  Especially the butter fish and and the torched sushi.  I've never had that before and it was melt in your mouth delicious.  And the desserts - the mango/lychee slushie is amazing. I had 3 :)   The green tea creme brulee is lovely as well - you can really taste the green tea flavour.    For a place this busy the service was great - clearing plates in a timely manner and checking on our orders.    I would definitely come back here again - it's in my rotation now.  For dinner it's approx $28 + tax/tip (for our large group they automatically added 15% tax on the bill).  For all the food we crammed in our mouths that is an amazing deal,"}
{"text":"Me and hubby came for dinner for the first time. We both enjoyed the food. Beef sashimi was fresh. I wished there were more choices for sashimi tho( maybe it was weekday?!) Our overall experience was good! Will def come back"}
{"text":"What do you get when you go to an AYCE Japanese restaurant that attempts to position itself as high-end? Sadly, a mixed bag of emotions.  *** The Menu ***  Karaage Chicken - we started with this. Not sure if it was because we were starving, but this tasting amazing! It was light, crispy, and well-made.  I felt it wasn't something that needed to be ordered more than once.  Ox Tongue Skewer - this came out delightfully thin and tasty. We ordered it again and it was completely different (very thick cut and just overall bad). So, we ordered it yet again, and it came out poorly made again. I conclude that our first order of ox tongue was made perfectly as a fluke.  Salmon Teriyaki - we ordered one unit, but two units came.  They were huge bricks that couldn't be overcooked more, yet we selected \"medium-rare\" when ordering from the iPad. What's the point of giving the option of rarity?  Age Tofu - this is usually inedible at most AYCE restaurants, but KAKA made it quite well. It came in a gourmet seafood broth. I give this thumbs up.  Beef Steak - these were huge juicy pieces of \"beef\".  I put that in quotation marks because I am 99% confident that this is meat glue beef. If you don't know what that is, Google it. Let's just say that an AYCE place would go bankrupt by offering this type of beef if it wasn't meat glue.  The texture is gummy and just felt overall fake.   Torched sushi and pressed sushi - this is one of their differentiators from other AYCE joints. They were mediocre and I did not place more than one order.   Sashimi - their selection was limited compared to their competitors. If you want a greater variety of fresh sashimi, this isn't the place to go.  short ribs - they were pretty good but over salted.  Ramen - noodles were smooshy (far overcooked) and the soup base was bland as water.    *** desserts ***  mango slushie - their best dessert. It is fresh, tangy, and reminds me a bit of Mango Mix from Destiny's BBT.  creme brule - it was okay for AYCE standard but wayyyyyy too sweet.  ice cream - it was not frozen enough, not sure if intentional. it was almost like milkshake.  *** atmosphere & service *** Service was friendly. Nice ambiance. Noise level slightly highy. Attractive interior design. My only gripe was that their pot lights produced rays of heat that made the experience uncomfortably warm. Parking is hectic as it's in First Markham Place.  *** verdict ***  All things considered, I would not come back to KAKA. A table for two costed $70 before tax and tip for their weekend dinner. By offering mediocre torched and pressed sushi, they pitch a premium price that I just don't see the value in. At that price point, I would rather go to a fine a la carte Japanese place and be able to eat comfortably full on higher quality items.   The weekend special includes a single order of baked scallop, torched sashimi (salmon and tuna), and a torched citrusy salmon sashimi.  Most other AYCE places offer a weekend special of AYCE scallop sashimi and amaebi (sweet shrimp). Though I applaud KAKA for doing things differently, I'd rather have the latter."}
{"text":"They don't take credit cards. The food was just ok, and even though you order with an ipad, you still have to get a server to come confirm the order. And of course our iPad was starting to die around closing time...it probably would have taken them so much time to get us another one. Still undecided if I would go again."}
{"text":"I came on a weeknight without a reservation and I was seated immediately at the bar. All the tables were for reservations.   Service: We were seated immediately, but we weren't given tea or menus. Me and my friend kept waiting for a few minutes, we see some waiters standing out chatting with each other. It seems like they forgot about us. We waved one down and we finally got water and menus. I already had a really bad impression at this point. This is very inefficient of any restaurant to not give customer menus. If customers have no menus, we cannot order and it just slows everything down. This also shows lack of attentiveness. Throughout the dinner, they forgot to bring us some of the special torched sushi we ordered.   Food: I didn't expect much for quality given that it is an AYCE restaurant. Everything was mediocre.   I don't think I would come back. The service was just really bad."}
{"text":"Food and service was very disappointing. Waited a long time in between dishes. All the food was cold, tasted like low quality and many of the sauces didn't mesh well. The torched sushi wasn't executed well, tasted very cheap even though the lunch AYCE for 2 people came out to $70 before taxes. Better off going to Ja Bistro or Miku for that price."}
{"text":"I came here several months ago, but in recently creating my Yelp account, my experience at Kaka was so awful I had to submit a review.  Unfortunately the worst AYCE experience I have had e.v.e.r.  I was hearing a lot of hype about this place both through friends and social media, so after my first AYCE spot closed down, I thought I'd try this place out.  It was packed upon arrival (the hype!) and it probably took just over half an hour to be seated... which I suppose isn't bad considering I later heard stories of the restaurant claiming to be booked up for two weeks straight (how is that even possible?).  I thought the iPad ordering system was really cool... until I started to get notifications while ordering that pretty much half the menu was \"unavailable\" that night.  There were some pretty interesting/novel items on the menu (despite not being able to order many of them), but I found both the sashimi selection and kitchen menu to be limited.  Of the items that were available for ordering, they featured mostly deep-fried items and items that were heavily packed with rice.  Overall, I found the sashimi to be not very fresh (during my visit), and the kitchen food lacked flavour... or just tasted strange (to me).  I think my favourite item was the Baked Oyster with Cheese, although you can only eat so many pieces of an item drowning in a mayo-based sauce.  Aside from the sub-par food, the service I received was a disaster!  I think in trying to accommodate the high traffic, the table I sat at didn't seem to exist on their ordering system and every single item I ordered (OK, not every... but for sure 90% of what we ordered) was delivered to either the table on my left or right... Only one server seemed to realise what was happening and was constantly running to our table to correct the other servers... who never seemed to catch on despite our repeated complaints (poor guy!  Didn't catch his name, but he was probably the one saving grace of the dining experience).  TLDR: Below average: menu selection/quality of food/service/value/everything... would not come back."}
{"text":"Confused when ordering and every time we ordered, waitress need to check before they are get confirmed! So there's time waste"}
{"text":"Best Ayce sushi in Toronto. Although their services is alittle but slow but the food quality is the best in town."}
{"text":"The only downside was that they ran out of Green Tea creme brulee even though we ordered it pretty early on.  Other than that, absolutely loved this place!  I came here with my brother and his friend while I was visiting from out of town. Joanne was our waitress and she was very nice and attentive!  The torched sushi is amazing, I would recommend the Ebi and Salmon!"}
{"text":"I didn't try the Markham location because it was very busy and far from my workplace. This AYCE is certainly amazing. Specializing in torched sushi, other menu items are also really enjoyable. Every torched sushi is heated just right. Not a single piece was even slightly burnt. Sashimi was fresh and deep fried items weren't oily . Comparing with other AYCE sushi in downtown, Kaka is the best one by far.  The only thing I can complain about is that the waiters tried to serve us other table's order a few times."}
{"text":"I gave ONE star because the manager (I assume, woman with short hair) basically straight out insulted our English.   We went during the Moon Festival on a Sunday. The environment was nice. Food was honestly okay - seafood was subpar. Service was quite slow since their kitchen was literally only one side of the restaurant. I believe there were 5 chefs manning our food.   We wrote down our comments on the receipt, as there was a section intended for this, and tried to flag down a waiter for 2 minutes (mind you, this is a small place). The manager (??) lady came by and asked how everything went and we mentioned our comments. She started to take a look. Myself and another girl in our group wrote down brief and succinct comments with shorthand (tho, plz, etc) since there was barely enough space for comments. The first thing the lady asked was \"Whose English is this?\" (our friend raised her hand since she wrote most of it) and in response, \"Oh, what grade are you in?\" (Friend: 2nd year). The lady then gave her a look, implying that my friend should be embarrassed of her English/her English should be better.  I would've (and should've) went off on her right then and there but the lady continued on to the our next comment, about how the seaweed salad was unusually fluorescent green. We obviously knew food colouring is involved but she literally spent 2 minutes telling us to take our complaints to the company and to go on 'YouTube' to spread the word for companies to stop adding dyes to 'help them out.' She said she was all about that \"healthy, homemade food\" life and that the restaurant only carried \"homemade\" items as well (really??). I tuned her out and unfortunately, all of her rambling made me forget about her insults.   TL;DR Basically, we gave comments in the comments section, as requested (what other reason could there be for having a comments section?) and the lady chose to be insulting and got defensive.   And not that it's anybody's business, I've grown up with English all my life and my friend has been in Canada for long enough to have good English..."}
{"text":"For AYCE, this is one of my favorite places. I love the huge selection of foods here. All are pretty fresh. My favourite are the aburi rolls and mango slush dessert (my friends literally get a bunch of these and it's like a slushy drink).   During the weekends they also surprise you with some chef specials (cannot be ordered on the iPad but they will drop you off a dish for you to try).  I'd highly advise making a reservation. It's really crowded during weekends and nights. Regular wait time up to one hour."}
{"text":"Holy.   Just like everyone else, I believe this place has AH-mazing quality and you really are getting what you paid for. But I guess what you paid for is a bit much ... It roughly came up to $40 per person on a Sunday evening ... ouchie.  In addition, there's an 1 and 1/2 hour of seating time, so make it worth it!  Other than the price, just about everything else was magical.   For each table, you get one special platter; something along the quality you would get at a nice place in downtown Toronto. Already, in my opinion, that platter is worth ~$25.   After that, get the blow-torched and oshizushi. You will not be disappointed.   I definitely wasn't and I had my go at them. It's something that you feel like you can eat until you throw-up (sorry for that...) and then keep eating BECAUSE IT'S JUST SO FREAKIN DELICIOUS.  After that, their creme brulees are absolutely spectacular. Not too sweet and Kaka has it in jasmine or matcha flavoured!  All in all, I would definitely come again. It is pricey, but I would go for a special occasion again.   Tip: Call a day before to get a table!! Me and my boyfriend walked in w/o a reservation, but we got a seat right at the bar w/o waiting because it was only the two of us. It gets super packed, especially on weekend nights."}
{"text":"Tried out KAKA all you can eat - I heard it was hard to make reservations so we booked a table on a weeknight for dinner. You get a 2 hour limit seating, which I think is enough time since all the food came really quickly (they actually made everything super fast!). Service was great.  Highlights: * soft boiled egg (appetizer) * torched beef sushi * teppan grilled shrimp * ikura sushi * mango slush dessert * hokkaido milk tea crème brûlée  Too much hype: * pressed sushi (it was just okay..) * spicy salmon sushi (this wasn't fresh) * grilled salmon belly (too oily)"}
{"text":"WOW...hands down the best Japanese buffet I've never had in the GTA.  It's pricier than the other AYCE buffet places, but it's worth it.  Once the order was in, food came out almost immediately.  They are very efficient.  The torched and pressed sushi was definitely the highlight.  I ate so much I couldn't really enjoy the dessert; I only managed to try a few.  Love the yogurt and the creme brulees."}
{"text":"Typical AYCE sushi place but with the additional seared sushi option. Very busy and you should definitely make reservations. It's probably one of the better ayce around but I'd still prefer to pay the equivalent for fewer pieces of higher quality sushi"}
{"text":"I heard about Kaka All You Can Eat through friends & family members. So wanted to try it out to see what the hype was about.   You really need to make a reservation at least 2 weeks or more in advance. This place gets really fully booked if you don't. We were lucky to get a table for two within a 1 week notice..but then it was a Monday. So try your chances, cause prior to that, ppl told me you need at least 1 month advance to get a table.   The ambiance of the restaurant is quite nice. With dim lighting and modern decor, a mix of East and West. They have Japanese Sake Barrels never the front entrance wall, and nice black textured walls with comfy benches with pillows against the walls.  They use ipads as their menus, so its quite easy to order and the food comes quickly as well. One thing that is a bit annoying, is that each item on the menu is 1 pc only. So if you have a large group and want more than 1 pc of of sushi, you have to continuously tap to add them one by one.   Items we tried on a Monday Night:  Appetizer ~ Mushroom Soup ( Just 3 spoonful, for 1 serving) Didn't find anything special. It was ok.  Torched Sushi Forgot the variety of fish, but there was only 3 types that night. The taste was quite nice, I liked the torched aroma & taste.  Assorted Yakitori (Chicken Hearts, Ox Tongue, & Beef?) My favourite were the chicken hearts, it had a nice chew and taste to them. Second was the ox tongue, 3rd I can't really remember what it was, but i think it was beef, it was soso.  Shrimp Tempura I didn't like the batter they used, tasted more like tempura you find in supermarket bento boxes.  Grilled Eel Sushi This was quite good in flavour. Their rice was pressed just right, not too hard nor soft that it falls apart.  Spring Egg This was gross. I never had it before, so decided to try it. It was basically a semi cooked egg, sitting in a clear broth. I poked the egg yolk and mixed it in and it felt like I was eating a raw egg wash, the broth was  also cold.  Baked Oysters with Cheese This was ok the oysters were quite small in size.   Assorted Sashimi The salmon and butterfish are my favourite, they were very fresh. But the tai fish had this strange taste to it. The raw beef sashimi was ok, but i wouldn't keep ordering it.  Assorted Desserts Greek Yoghurt ~ The yoghurt was solidified and tasted more like a custard. It was ok. But wouldn't order it again. Mango Slush ~ Nice strong mango flavour and very refreshing. Vanilla Creme Brulee ~ Typical brulee, nice candy shell on top and creamy centre. Green Tea Creme Brulee ~ I like this one more because you don't usually see this flavour at AYCE.   Overall, i would come back again maybe on a weekend to see if the have a bigger variety of selection. Cause on a Monday evening their selection was quite minimal. Dunno if it would be different on a weekend, till next time!      S"}
{"text":"I've been dying to try this AYCE place for awhile now! You need to book reservations at least 2 weeks in advance for a busy weekend.   We got our seat right away. It was packed at 7pm on a Friday evening. We ordered from an iPad. I love this because you get to see all the pictures of the items and read about what it is before ordering. We got all the torched sushi along as with the weekend special torch to try. The sushi that stood out was the ika and red snapper.   They had a variety of cooked foods and rolls. My faves were: baked mussel, seaweed tempura (wasabi sauce was so good), salmon belly, honey mustard shrimp roll, ika sushi, salmon and , green tea creme brûlée.    The food came very quickly after we ordered. The serve staff gave us things when we asked.  It is a more pricey than other places, at $32.99 before taxes and tips on weekends. Their speciality is their torched sushis. I havent seen another AYCE with this.   I liked the Yelp tip to order the mango slush as a drink. That was awesome! Saved me from ordering a coke!"}
{"text":"I was excited about finally scoring a reservation for this place. We tried a few times and it is always booked solid far in advance with good reason. This place does sushi right. Go with an appetite cause you'll want to try it all and get seconds on some of the really delicious morsels. Like the ox tongue, takayuki balls, tempura mix, mango lassie, I could go on. Pretty much everything we ordered with our i pad was delicious. The portions are small so you can make a few orders every so often and the food came out fast and beautifully presented. The service was great. Everyone was so nice. The five of us had a great time and went away feeling totally satisfied but not stuffed as some AYCE places leave you. Kaka had light tasty selections so that you felt as though you were really getting your money's worth in quality above all. I would absolutely go back here."}
{"text":"My latest visit at KAKA AYCE was both amazing and not satisfactory at the same time! STILL easily my favourite AYCE sushi in Toronto even with the weekend pricing (you get what you pay for).   Our group was 12 people and we were quickly seated, and food started coming quickly which is great. Food quality and flavour is better than the other AYCE restaurants. The raw salmon is very fresh, and they don't pack too much rice either.   Downside is that only the kitchen food came along with the sashimi and maki rolls BUT NOT the special rolls (Weekend special items and Chef Frank's Special Roll). After waiting, re-ordering and still receiving nothing, I concluded that these more exclusive (and expensive haha) items sometimes only comes after a bit of chasing down the waitress!   Also, lame that some of the items at AYCE are not actually \"all you can eat\". Limited quantities for the unagi and foie gras roll, monkfish liver, scallop nigiri and salmon ikura on rice. Didn't know this was the case when I saw photos on Instagram. BUT DESPITE THIS, these items were delicious and you will NOT find it at another AYCE restaurant!   Conclusion: Food is great but make sure you receive your entire order (especially special items)!"}
{"text":"BEWARE - KAKA downtown was below my expectations. I've been to KAKA Sushi several times in Markham and thought it was great. The Downtown location is NOT nearly as good and the service is disappointing, especially for 34.99$ on weekends! Moreover, when comparing the two, the quality and selection is worse.   To begin with, the quality is not good. The sushi quality is poor, such as the salmon sashimi which is pale in color like in sushi buffets. Their tempura sauce and ankimo sauce are very diluted with water and barely had flavour. The beef and salmon tataki were tough and not fresh at all. They did not have the foie gras unagi roll that they posted on their Instagram page. When the quality, sauces and flavours are not there, the taste is lacking as well.   Unlike most AYCE restaurants and their uptown location, they do NOT have iPads to order. Given this, there is an expectation to deliver all items ordered but they failed at this. I asked for the Chef's Special from my first order until dessert and to about 3-4 different servers.    To make everything worse, some of the servers did not smile at all and made it seem like they were miserable. This does not make the overall experience better.   I will not be giving KAKA downtown another visit, but will definitely go back to the Markham location."}
{"text":"This was by far one of the best AYCE sushi places I have ever visited. This restaurant offers a great selection, including torched sushi and pressed sushi. The sashimi was very fresh, and the tempura was fried to perfection. We came here on the weekend, and they offered complimentary specials that aren't usually on the menu.  I highly recommend trying the spring egg soup; it's unlike anything I have ever tasted and was quite refreshing. My family also tried every type of torched and pressed sushi, and every one of them was delicious.   The service was fast, friendly, and the food also came out relatively quickly. I would definitely come again to celebrate another special occasion (since it is pricey, especially on the weekend)."}
{"text":"I just left the restaurant. So disappointed. Service was very slow and the food sucked.!!! I just spent $30 per person on food that was worth $9.99. !!!"}
{"text":"Shitty place I could not even get food they kick me out although they had empty tables. We called at for check what time they open they said. Nothing about reservation and they mainly run on reservation. The server at the door is annoying I just wanted to punch her as she was being very dumn and stupid. She keep repeating same shit which does not even make sence and cannot argue with her. The whole waiting thing is stupid and need to be properly resolved."}
{"text":"Kaka offers unique sushi that are not normally in other AYCE restaurants so thats a plus, and they also taste good! However I found the menu to be very limited, by the second round of ordering, we didn't know what else to order anymore! Hopefully they will expand their menu soon. Their desserts are also amazing, very delicious and unique - they have Earl Grey Milk Ganache Squares, lavender chocolate pots, and more. Service was really good too - food came fast and it was really easy to order on the iPad.    The main con for me is that it's more on the pricey side for a limited menu selection... it was $27.99 per person for dinner on a weekday and that doesn't include tax and tips yet.   Overall, it was a good experience and we will probably come back but not often due to the price."}
{"text":"Had to wait way too long and they never pick up their phone. Food was great but overall it wasnt as amazing as everyone makes it seem.   Its better than mediocre buy i expect it to be with such steep pricing."}
{"text":"Sushi and sashimi is fresh , however service is slow and has a dumb system with the tablet ordering it is slow and not efficient when waiting for an order to be sent out . Here's the process , you get a tablet , select orders , then send it out AND wait for the server to come by to confirm the send out . Servers don't get a notification when a table sends out an order unless they see the tablet , also not enough servers to be running this kind of system . Maybe needs some improvement in app development or something ? Anyways food was still good, not a go to spot but is good for social gathering ."}
{"text":"The only reason I gave them 3 star Because there was poke stop close to the restaurant. The food wasn't really surprise to me..."}
{"text":"With high expectation after reading all the reviews, I am very disappointed with the food. We had to book the table three weeks ahead of time. We started the meal with a special weekend sushi dishs. The fishs were good quality, the special sauce they put on was only okay. Then the food just went downhill after that dish. All the sashimi and sushi were just average. The 'famous' torched sushi looks special, but they weren't tasty at all. All the hot dishes were only average or even below average. All the sauce were tasteless. They do have a few special dishes that you don't find elsewhere, but I would rather pick somewhere that focused more on food quality instead of just trying to be special but cannot keep up with the quality. The dessert selection were good, that's the only thing worth commenting. The service was mixed, some waiters were attentive, some didn't know what they are doing. For example, one brought us the dessert, but don't give us the spoon. Overall, disappointed. Will not come back again, especially for this kind of price."}
{"text":"Service: very fast, amazing quality sushi.   Food: presentation of the sushi was very impressive. Sushi rolls was garnished with herbs. Specialities included torched sushi and speciality sashimi that is on the house.   Sashimi was very thick and rich. Not like other ayce places this location is very generous with the meat. They also had beef sashimi which a lot of places don't have.   Food is vey aesthetic perfect for taking your snaps and instagram photos.   The grilled meats were also very juicy and flavorful.   Ambiance: loud, energetic and exciting environment. Dim lighting, a lot of young adults. They played good millennial music perfect throwbacks for he audience.   PROTIP: you MUST book ahead of time at least the day before or latest the morning of, if you walk in there is little chance that you'll get seats. Or you may have to wait a couple of hours. THIS PLACE IS VERY POPULAR."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my dining experience at Kaka. Probably the best ayce sushi restaurant in the GTA.  It costs $33 per person to do the ayce on weekend nights, but I thought it was worth it.  Most item were well prepared and very yummy. I highly recommend getting their chicken wing, lamb skewer, press sushi, torch sushi, and their desserts. Maybe avoid their soups, they were very salty.  The service was good too. It was fast and attentive.  I would go back for lunch in the future."}
{"text":"For AYCE the food is pretty good.  U only get 1.5 hours to eat & order from time of reservation.  if u are late then it's really too bad cuz timing starts from time of reservation or time u sat down.  1.5 hours is a little rushed.  That day I was caught in traffic so arrived around 10-15min late.  Plus time to look at menu & order food & wait for food to come probably had less than hour to eat.  Very rushed...I don't like to be rushed when eating...but food is pretty decent.  Overall was okay.  They have torched sushi so I guess that's a plus But that's also probably y they charge more than other AYCE places."}
{"text":"Good  all you can eat place and for $35, it was worth the $35. Desserts were definitely small,  but the pleasant. Would try this again for a solid, quality all you can eat near my home."}
{"text":"Pros: ordering on iPad, fast service, good variety  Cons: food was not the greatest (except for maybe the torched sushi), expensive, \"Last call for food\"??"}
{"text":"Went there on my and my son's birthday (yes we share the same birthday). The waitress was very nice to make it special by giving us candles in two puddings. She even took 10% off two of our prices without us asking.   I've heard good things about this place and knowing its price, we decided to go on our birthdays. I thought for $35/adult and $11/kid, it better be good. Well I have to say besides the special torched sushi, everything else was average compare to other AYCE. Their menu is not as big as others but has everything basically that we'd order. The shrimp tempura wasn't that special, with very thick layer of flour. Everything else tasted good, but like I said, nothing too special. The dessert was not bad. Your typical green tea red bean ice cream, there was also Creme brule and mango slush.   In conclusion, good service, food came fast, but average taste of food for an AYCE."}
{"text":"I went to Kaka after reading about it and seeing the selection of options that were a different than the typical AYCE place. I also kept in mind that with the variety, this was still AYCE and the quality would not be amazing, however, with the premium prices ($28/weekday) I expected a little better than average. Unfortunately, this restaurant set the bar at a new low.  If you decide to venture here, look forward to these things:  - Rice that's unusually long and not very sticky. - Ginger. Oh wait, you're not even served ginger here. - Wasabi that's shaped like cupcake icing and has no wasabi flavor. - Soy sauce diluted with water. - Lots of batter and oil. You have to try the tempura. - Cold food that is typically warm (e.g. soup, beef). - Surprising hand rolls. You might think that the eel at the top of the hand roll is the beginning of a great hand roll only to realize there's actually no eel inside the roll. Trickery at its finest. - Items arriving at significant delayed times from the same order. (e.g. Yes - of course I want to eat a shrimp tempura when I'm having dessert)  The only good thing I could say was the service was decent. Not amazing, but it was nothing to complain about."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday, and I was super disappointed. I had read so much about this place, so I was expecting a lot, but I found the restaurant to be mediocre. First impression was really great though; the interior decor is rather nice, and I liked being able to order from a tablet at the table. The service was good enough too I think, though they seemed to give preference to the Chinese patrons. Main thing though, the sushi just wasn't very good. The sashimi selection was very small, and not particularly fresh, and the sushi was just as poor. The rice was too soft and mushy. But the torched sushi was the worst: not only was the rice mushy, but it was also overly oily, and most pieces would fall apart before they even reached your mouth. Lastly, this place costs more than most AYCE places, so you'll end up paying more for poor food. If you want a similar experience, I'd recommend one of the 168 Sushi buffets. They offer the same tablet ordering and nice decor, but with a wider selection of food (including crab legs on weekends), and better food overall."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place, and the sushi was amazing!  What can you do to make AYCE new and exciting for people? Add blowtorch sushi. The quality of the sushi and sashimi here is really good. They even have tuna (that melts in your mouth) on a Monday. Most places don't even serve that at all, or make you pay more on a weekend etc..   We tried to make reservations  here earlier in the day but were told they were packed full. So we tried to walk in right at 5pm to see if we could get seats. They seated us and told us we could indeed be seated, but had to leave by 7pm as they had a fully booked restaurant. We're older now and eat a lot less so that wasn't a big deal (we ended up finishing at 6pm lol)  After we were seated, we were given an iPad to do our ordering (genius), and then were given some complimentary blowtorch sushi to eat while we ordered. Delicious and great customer service.  The awesome customer service continued all night. One of my pet peeves is having dirty dishes left on our table and a server was by every time to clear a plate.   One dish that REALLY surprised and stood out was the spring egg. It was a poached egg in a miso broth and it was SO GOOD. Wish I ordered another but I was stuffed.  The 2 complaints I do have about this place are 1, there was literally only one guy who could speak English or Cantonese, and any time we asked for something they had to flag that other guy down.   The other is the cooked foods was only so-so. We ordered the pork belly skewer and it was tough as leather.. hard to eat. The kalbi was tough and salty. The teriyaki salmon was really dry.   We ordered dessert and wanted vanilla creme brulee, but were given green tea ones. We tried to exchange it for vanilla but were then told that they ran out of green tea. This was a little weird on their part, they should have told us before giving us the green tea but I think this might attribute to the fact that the guy who gave it to us didn't speak English.  But if you just stick to what's good here, you won't be disappointed.  A good price too, if paying by cash you get 10% off so it was just over $25 per person (with no drinks)."}
{"text":"It is expensive use to be amazing alot of their items are not there anymore. When you order on send the items you have to wait for the server to confirm your orders by entry their code on the ipad which slow you down from Ordering more food. Just went there last week our order didn't come until 20minutes later we had to complain for our grill squid to come out after 1hr. but it wasn't even busy i was disappointed wish we could eat more but the food order came out slow and there was not a-lot of option to choose compare to their big choices offer last year. Hype is died down not as great as it use to be. They only take cash or debit which is odd."}
{"text":"Heard a lot of good things about this new AYCE place in Markham. Apparently this was the new joint in town and was very very good according to multiple reviews. However, to get a reservation here you need to book at least 3 weeks in advanced as it is so popular.   Apparently try the blowtorched sushi and rolls. Because they taste good and are different. The problem is they don't have many options on the menu for that.   Atmosphere: nice and new designs and comfortable tables. They didn't have enough chairs however and we're using folding chairs at a few tables because of how busy it was. But nice woodworking and decent setup.   They use the Ipad ordering system with an app that most AYCE places are using so it's familiar   Menu: not a lot of selection you'd expect for a restaurant charging $31 in the AYCE space. I know AYCE is a mainly Toronto concept but if you're at $31 you're expecting some really unique and new combinations of rolls, as well as a lot of varieties of sashimi and other dishes. Not the most I've seen, and nothing really that stands out.   Taste: again my palate is already tempered by the price point. I did enjoy the blow torched items but there are only 3 types of sushi like that and maybe 3 rolls like that? So it really wasn't the big thing I expected. The apps were just okay in the context of an AYCE.   Vetdict: look there is some novelty but at the end of the day many of items are generic AYCE Sushi type food and the price is a higher than you'd expect to pay for that kind of quality."}
{"text":"Food selection and quality is very normal, doesn't really justify for the higher price compared to other all u can eat jap food. Service is below average. We were told that we only have the table for 1.5 hour but server keep coming over to ask if we have any more food coming even before the 1.5 hours limit. We ordered some desserts and waited for long time for it to come, I finally asked the waitress if they have forgotten our order and were told that those dessert are only available on weekends. Would be nice if they tell us that or just provide different menu for weekdays and weekends."}
{"text":"Kaka used to be one of my favourite sushi places, but there quality has noticeably decreased as it's gained popularity.   Their sashimi are still pretty fresh and good. And I've always loved their aburi sushi. They have a wide variety, and it's pretty well executed. The brûléed tops help the sashimi on top melt in your mouth. Unfortunately, our sushi was room temperature... as if it was prepared and was sitting on the counter for a while before brought to our table. The rest of the menu is ok. Pretty standard AYCE stuff.   The environment is pretty, making it a nice spot for a meal. Seats are limited though, and with the restaurant's popularity, try to book a table in advanced. Walk-ins would have long wait times"}
{"text":"2.5--What a difference a year makes! We came for lunch yesterday and had the ayce. We were seated immediately and understood the 2 hour dining limit from our previous visit. They have iPads for ordering which made the process quick and simple. The one annoying bit is getting a waiter to approve the order but it wasn't busy so we were always able to flag someone down. The service was prompt and attentive throughout our entire meal. The food quality is still good however the service model has changed. We noticed once we placed our order, it took 15-20 minutes for any food to show up. We had items in our order that were missing and we made the assumption that the items show in the iPad would appear the same on our table. For example, we order a flamed torch roll and were expecting to get a roll, we got two pieces each. This happened with their kaka roll as well, 2 pieces each. They can definitely improve on their descriptions within their iPad. For $31, I expected more. After waiting awhile for our food, having to follow up on items, we decided to leave. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Really was excited to try this place. With so many places in the area you can really tell this is the hot spot. I could not get a reservation so we just tried a to walk in and after a little bit of a wait we were able to score a table. I must say the wait was worth it. The menu offered many different options that were fresh and tasty. The service was great as well."}
{"text":"Was a bit wary about going to an all you can eat in First Markham, but some friends said we should try it so we did. My wife and I have been trying to find a place to replace our old all you can eat. I have to say this place comes close, there was a small incident were the new girl dropped some skewers behind me and got a little on my coat. They quickly apologized multiple times and gave us 10% off, which was the point I knew they care about the customer. The pressed sushi and torched sushi are a good way to set them apart from other all you can eat restaurants and the best part they were really good. One thing I love about this restaurant is the portions are so manageable, order a roll it is 2-3 pieces not 6-8 which for 2 people is perfect.   Breakdown:  Salmon sashimi - fresh and delicious  Torched salmon - fluffy and light with a hint of char  Tempura - good but batter was a bit sweeter than I like  Fatty pork and lamb skewers - taste good but too much powdered spices I like it to be cooked into the meat more.   Green dragon roll - my favourite, avocado was so creamy it tasted perfect  Oysters - were not bad considering I don't usually like them.   The desserts in this place are to die for, variety I have never seen in all you can eat before. Jasmine, green tea, or vanilla creme brûlée. Dark chocolate, cappuccino, or lavender chocolate pudding. Mango slush that will keep you ordering more. Last but not least earl grey ganache, more like a chocolate truffle you would buy from a chocolatier, it was so rich and melted beautifully in my mouth.   It may be pricy but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday afternoon with a giant craving for spicy salmon sushi, and I left with nothing but disappointment.   For $30 per person it's absolutely not worth it when there are other cheaper+better places. The spicy salmon sushi was literally half breadcrumbs and it eliminated any little flavour the \"spicy\" salmon was supposed to have. The other sushi wasn't particularly good either, everything was completely average. Fish quality was okay though, didn't get sick afterwards, though I feel like it might have been frozen or their fridges are just super cold.   Tempura was also okay, but again nothing special. The quality of the meat in the black pepper beef didn't seem that great. The tempura scallop and chicken karaage would've been better without that gross warm mayonnaise over it, it added nothing flavour wise and made it taste worse actually.   Their grilled mushrooms were pretty good, they didn't mess that up. Also their chocolate custard/pudding was amazing, I ordered maybe 6-7 just to make up for the mediocre quality of food and end off on a good note.  Service was okay, but again nothing special. I wouldn't bother coming here again. If you do, try to fill up on the sashimi and just skip the sushi."}
{"text":"I heard rez are a must here and a good week in advance to boot! Superior quality for AYCE and you get to use an ipad to order your food (when you order 1 takoyaki it isn't 1 order . . . it's literally 1 takoyaki ball, just keep that in mind when you order).  I'm not a huge sashimi fan, so loved the fact that they have seared items as well (they're small but you just order a bunch). YUM! I actually wished we went back again during our week out there! I didn't actually see the bill but I'm sure it was pretty pricey for an AYCE place!!"}
{"text":"In a nutshell, this place has good food, great service, nice decor and ambiance but is a little on the pricey side compared to similar AYCE sushi places I've been to.  All the food we had was fresh and tasty and we had lots of it! Between three of us, we had 65 dishes! Yah, we were pigs!  Orders were placed through a wireless iPad and arrived at our table very quickly. Empty dishes were cleared just as quickly. Our servers were friendly and efficient. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Got there early and didn't have to wait to be seated. The lunch specials come with soup, salad and dessert. Get the green tea creme brûlée, it was great. The salmon torched dish was great. The fish could be thicker but all in all it's above the other sushi restaurants in the area. My only complaint would be the service was really slow. We waited 25 minutes for the bill."}
{"text":"I love their torched sushi here! I've been here twice and i really have no complaints except sometimes their service can get really slow. This place is great, the seating area have pillows..very comfy!   Their chicken wings app is pretty tasty, best one I've tasted from all other AYCE sushi places although they cut it in half and ration their wings. We usually order the baked oyster, takoyaki, chicken kaarage, braised pork belly, shrimp tempura,  beef ribs, and garlic shrimp. All very good!  Their pressed sushi, torched sushi, and sashimi are the main reason we came back. First off, their torched and pressed sushi are 1 per order which is great. Other places give you 5 pieces per order. This 1 per order method is fast, the customer can try a lot and none goes to waste. I would skip the typical making rolls such as dynamite, sushi roll and so on... it's nothing special and you can get them anywhere, but incase you do order them it's 3 pieces/order.  The torched sushi are my fave! It has a smokey flavour that compliments the protein and the sauce. Sashimi is fresh no complaints.   You have to order all of their dessert, I have a sweet tooth but their desserts are not your typical AYCE sushi desserts. My favourite is the mango passion fruit.  And it's also worth mentioning that they have an ipad menu, you also don't have to wait for the waitress to confirm since it's 1 per order.  One of my favourite sushi AYCE"}
{"text":"Typical AYCE with an over hyped reputation.  Food is decent and the prices, selection and atmosphere are respectable.  There are other AYCE in York region, but no other with blow-torched sushi!  Meh..."}
{"text":"I came back because I am a believer in second chances. We all make mistakes. The point in life is to learn from them and to make things better.   Kaka did all of that and even more. This time things went perfectly. Food came out on time. All my ordered items showed up. There were no missing items. Service was very warm and friendly. They actually talked to me and were so polite.   The whole atmosphere was night and day compared to my first visit. I could feel things have improved and the staff changed for the better. The food is solid and the selection is varied. I would recommend people give this place a second try if your first experience wasn't perfect.   The management here clearly is listening to its audience and will get it right!   Thank you Kaka for a lovely dinner! 5 stars *****"}
{"text":"Updated review. Went there for dinner this time on a weekend, the restaurant is filled with young people with a vibrant atmosphere.  Service is attentive and efficient.  They have a few weekend specials that are quite creative and impressive.  All the dishes tasted freshly made, personally I really enjoyed their variety of food.  The skewers and cooked food are very tasty and delicious.  They added more choices for their sushi and sashimi selection which is better than most AYCE places in GTA.  Overall, the experience is pleasant and please make reservations for weekend if you don't want to line up."}
{"text":"So I had a very drawn out experience here. Arrived at 6:15 and was seated for two right before 7. The delay made me super excited to eat, but my excitement slowly diminished throughout the evening.  The service here was pretty bad. That's it. It was certainly friendly, but bad. Had to remind the staff a number of times for standard things that we should've already had like soy sauce, condiments and menus.   I wish I could give a proper review of the food, but the items we desperately wanted were sold out. I'm pretty reasonable and I can understand an AYCE restaurant running out of one, two maybe five things, but oh my word every time we made an order of 10+ things we received 3. I can say that most of the fish and rolls we did receive were better than other AYCE sushi restaurants, but as the evening progressed and I began to get disappointed I just started ordering whatever was available to get my money's worth. We spent a total of 2 hours here, but only 30 minutes were dedicated to actually eating. The rest of the time we were waiting, reordering items that did not go through, flagging down staff and flat out sobbing.  Finally got the bill and that $39.54 for one person got my blood kinda hot because what the heck? They should really inform people before they dine that they don't have half the menu items, or at least offer a \"grand opening we-don't-have-everything\" discount because we shouldn't be paying full price for a fraction of the food. Maybe I'll come back when they get their ducks in a row."}
{"text":"It can get really crowded - so don't forget to book ahead of time. I had to call multiple times to book a dinner - not super responsive.  There's a lot of variety !! I love their variety in desserts. Sushi is good for AYCE !!  Very fast past and due to their popularity - 1.5 hr limit"}
{"text":"Let's just say blow torch sushi and pressed sushi, hands down. Lots of variety and in general everything tastes pretty good! They put too much rice in their sushi though.  The only thing is they are so busy so takes time to book a reservation. But otherwise, ordering had some hiccup. We lost one of our orders though they do iPad orders here... But all in all pretty good food and for s reasonable price. Would consider coming back here again~"}
{"text":"First time going here, my boyfriend made reservations 2 days ahead of time. When we arrived at 7, the place was FULL.  Really good AYCE sushi. My favourite was the torched sushi. I don't think I've ever been to an AYCE with premium sushi.   Overall great experience. Food was delicious and staff were very aware and quick."}
{"text":"food are delicious, service is good but not rush hour. reservation only!!! price is reasonable. perfect dinner"}
{"text":"This review is about a Friday lunch experience.  Friday lunch was all a la carta.  I tried to call at noon to make reservation.  The line was busy for 20 minutes straight.  I wondered if they were so busy, or if they hang up the phone to refuse calls.  We arrived at around 12:30pm.  The place was 50% to 60% filled.  I now kinda thought they hang up the phone to not take lunch reservation.    Food was generally okay.  The food quality was average.  A guy ordered a Sushi Combo 2.  Quite small portion.  I ordered a Chicken Teriyaki bento box.  Really large portion (Hint - order a bento box if you are a big eater).  I felt sorry for the guy and gave him all the vegetable tempuras, so he was not hungry after.    Services was minimum, with just order taking, serving then billing.  No refill of tea.  No asking if everything was okay.  I paid particular attention that the lady who delivered the soup and salads to us just placed the food on one end of the table for us to pass around.  She looked kind of depressed.  Overworked maybe?  The worst part was what I saw how some of the raw fish was handled.  We sat directly across the sushi counter.  A big tray of raw fish filets, unsliced, was placed open air on top of a glass shelf, unrefrigerated, for the whole duration we were there.  Only the raw salmon was refrigerated in a glass shelf.  Was it even hygienic?"}
{"text":"I have never been a big fan of AYCE or buffets since I prefer better quality food over a large quantity. Recently our family suggested that we check out Kaka. Everything tasted good and it was very easy to order the food through their tablet. Food came out quickly and we got everything we ordered. There is a 2 hours seating limit. Even if there is nobody waiting for your table or you come late, the 2 hours limit starts from your reservation time. I find it a bit pricey at $29.99 on a weeknight but they are one of the better AYCE Japanese restaurants."}
{"text":"We had to make dinner reservations almost 2 weeks in advance in order to secure a table for 8 and even then we only had 2 time slots available - 5pm or 9pm... Neither which are favorable.   Food was good for AYCE standards and our waitress was nice. Love their daily special (sushi platter) and they had a good selection of food you don't see elsewhere (e.g torched sushi and the rectangular block sushi).   In terms of pricing, it's above average for AYCE but good value considering what you're getting. We would come back again."}
{"text":"Came for the torched sushi and was not disappointed it! It was a little on the greasy side but still very good. Would come back for just that!"}
{"text":"I think Kaka is absolutely my favourite AYCE sushi restaurant in the GTA region. Having been to so many AYCE sushi places, Kaka stands out to me due to a lot of special items they have on their menu, including the famous torched and pressed sushi that they are known for.   One small thing though, since the place is super popular, it's best for you to reserve your table for the weekend about a week ahead of time, because sometimes they would turn walk-in customers away if they're fully booked for the day. Also, you can only call for reservation between 12-6pm, and not every time they will pick up immediately, so just keep trying.   Environment: Located at the First Markham Place, Kaka is easily accessible by car and by transit. If you're driving however, the plaza is known to be super popular and it may be difficult to find a parking space. My go to alternative is to park on the side where the old Cineplex used to be at, which is facing the Home Outfitters, and then walk a little bit over. It honestly saves so much time and frustration than to continuously looking for an open parking space.  The interior of the restaurant is clean and modern, really well renovated. I really like the wine bottle wall that you see when you first walk into the restaurant. Seating wise, the biggest spot for large groups are the ones where you sit on a round sofa, though it would suck for the middle person if he/she wants to leave for the bathroom. The round sofa can sit approximately 8 people, any more will be really tight. The smaller tables can be moved around to sit 2/4/6 people, though the tables themselves are quite small, so place your orders accordingly.  Food: Like many newer AYCE sushi joints, at Kaka you place your order from an iPad. It's good because you get to see how the dish will look like before you order and get a sense of how large the portion is. Here there is no distinction between the lunch and dinner menu, it's the same one which comes out to about $35 per person after tax and tips, if you don't order any additional drinks.  Some of my favourites include: - Torched/Pressed sushi - Sashimi (large slices) - Mango slushie (I usually order a bunch so it's kinda like ordering a drink without having to pay extra) - Featured soup (had lobster bisque and pumpkin soup, both really good) - Beef tongue skewer - Unagi/Eel sushi  Service: If this is your first time here a server will walk you through the ordering process. I believe you don't need to call the server to come over to confirm your order like at some other AYCE restaurants, you can place your orders yourself and sit tight for the food to come. The food come out relatively quickly, so you'd only have to order after you finish what's on the table."}
{"text":"What a rip off!! I've come for dinner on a weekday before, and was told certain items are only available on weekends. So I came on a Sunday, where we paid $32.99 per person (whaaat? Did they raise the price?)  As we were going through the iPad, a lot of items were unavailable to order, which left us confused. We asked one of the servers if there was something wrong with our iPad as everything we wanted was unavailable. She proceeded to tell us that the items we were selecting are apparently sold out.  You're telling me that we paid $32.99 to eat the same stuff as we would on a weekday?! Get outta here.  The food was mediocre, and the price is not even worth it for the \"premium\" food they are charging for.  Save your money, and move onto the next place. Going forward, I'll be heading to Kiku for my AYCE cravings"}
{"text":"This was my second time here and it has not disappointed me.  It's by far one of the best ACYE sushi restaurants in the GTA.  The service was nothing less than 5 stars! Very attentive servers, and the food came fairly quickly.  There's a large selection of torched sushi and everything was very fresh as I had expected.  I would advise anyone planning a dinner here to call a few days in advance as they do fill up quickly. The price is a bit steep ($30 Mon-Thurs, $32 weekend), but totally worth it."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and presented well. Unfortunately my experience was ruined when on of the servers was constantly coughing while he was handling the plates, chopsticks, and even when he was preparing the green seaweed salad. The restaurant was not as clean as it could of been."}
{"text":"Have to learn to not over indulge.. Sashimi (salmon, clam) are good & fresh even for non AYCE place.. grilled octopus, shrimp tempura, grilled shrimp are good, grilled king mushroom (by the slices), and grilled beef tongue are awesome.. the sushi that we tried, the bomb, torched salmon, double dragon are okay.. save some space for dessert.. mango freeze, creme brule, capuchino, are very good as well... overall this place quality are very good"}
{"text":"Best ayce sushi I've had so far. Everything was fresh and tasted as good as it looked. The service was really good and fast. Will def come back again and would recommend everyone to give it a try."}
{"text":"One of my favourite AYCE sushi restaurants in Toronto. Their torched sushi is incredible and that mango slush is just crack. This place gets busy so I'd recommend calling in advance for reservations."}
{"text":"I have to say this all you can eat place was so much more expensive than those I have been to. The sashimi was not that good compared to fancy places like Japango or Jabistro but definitely much better than all other AYCE places. I came here during lunch hours on Saturday for two people, I believed we paid like $78 including 15% tips. However, I have to admit, other than sashimi their cooked food was very diverse and surprisingly good. I have never been to any AYCE that have that have so much on their menu as Kaka. Their desserts were well-served. The service was really fast, I would like 5/5 for the service. I'm not saying the food at this place worths every penny because I still think it's overpriced and their sashimi was not that great, but the price was acceptable for good service and tasty cooked food."}
{"text":"My visit here was very disappointing. The service could have been definitely better. The food was good, but it wasn't enough to save the experience.   My friends and I arrived to this establishment on March 22 around 7 PM. We were soon seated and proceeded to order within the first 5 minutes. The food came very sporadic; we waited about 20 minutes for the rolls & sashimi. The rolls and sashimi were really good. After that, nothing else arrived for another 20 minutes. We expressed our concerns with a server, in which he said he would check but never came back. We waited, hoping the food would come.  At this point, it had been an hour since we sat down and half the stuff hasn't come yet. Again, we had to ask another server where our order was, but she didn't know why we weren't getting our order so she had to manually ask the chefs to make our order. We got some of the ordered things, but we were still missing many. The food that did arrive would arrive 20-40 minutes after ordering. We gave up waiting for the missing food when a server told us it was the final call.   We opted for dessert for the final call. The green tea ice cream was alright, it had some chunks of ice in it which I wasn't a fan of. The creme brulee was amazing though. We left this place around 9:30 with disappointment.  The real kicker was as we were finishing up dessert some of the missing orders arrived - it was 9:30."}
{"text":"There has been a lot of hype around this place and sadly, this place did not live up to it for me.  If you do not make a reservation, you pretty much need to wait since this place is super popular. I recommend coming before it opens at 12 pm if you do not want a long wait or just make a reservation.  As for food, I will admit that their selection was large, unique and quite tasty. Their sushi, sashimi, and even ramen were quite good. However, when it came to their beef and chicken teriyaki and other meat related dishes, many other ayce places just taste better. Also, do not order the chicken wings since they are beyond tiny. If you don't enjoy or order those meat dishes, then you will be fine.  For customer service, it was on the low end. You use an ipad to place your order and perhaps because there were so many people, some of the food didn't come or the wrong quantities were served. For instance,we ordered 4 shrimp tempura and got one. Then when we told them to give us three more, they came back and gave us 5 tempuras. Like wth, do you math? One of waitresses also spilled a miso soup on my friend by accident. She did apologize though and we were given a 10 percent discount.   Overall, this place is worth a try but I would probably not come again."}
{"text":"This review is largely due to the fact that our over all experience was just not up to par. This place was heavily hyped for us to try, but just to even get to try it and reserve seats was a nightmare.  Even when we did have a reservation they like to try and pack everyone in. I could tell our servers were getting frustrated as orders were getting misplaced, there was not a lot of room and it was just a lot of acrobatics needed to be done in order to get our food order.  Really there are other AYCE sushi places that have just as good if not better items. Overall Kaka is \"decent\", and they do show some creative menu items rotating some things but time will tell if they keep up with this practice. Their location is good which can explain why all the traffic, but personally for the price I am paying here I expect a bit better treatment, service and food.   Its a very strong MEH for me unfortunately, hopefully over time the hype will die down and their service improves."}
{"text":"A lot of hype, under delivers.  I was very excited to try Kaka AYCE as I am a huge fan of Japanese food and I'm always up for trying the latest and greatest. After seeing the mouth watering photos from my friends, I knew I had to book a reservation 3 weeks early. Getting someone to pick up the phone on the reservation phone line is a mission. I had to try several times over several days before being lucky enough to speak to a human being.  When I arrived, I found that booking my reservation 3 weeks prior may have been a result of unnecessary hype. The place wasn't as busy as I heard, with several empty tables.   Our party of 5 was squished into a small table of 4. It was very disappointing especially when I saw very nice circular table by the window that was empty the entire time.  That table wasn't even filled until 30 minutes later by another party of 5 which upset me a little bit.  In terms of the service, if this is the \"new and improved\" I would be scared to see what it was like before. The servers are essentially mechanical robots whose main duty is to fetch food, serve them to you, and take away dirty plates in the precision you would see in a manufacturing plant. There is little to no interaction. It is very challenging to get service for basic things like water/tea refills and extra napkins.   The weekend special is even more mind boggling. There is no explanation provided to you, they automatically place the order for you and serve it to you. My parents do not eat beef and one of the dishes is a blow torched beef sushi. It would have been nice if the server had explained the weekend special and taken our order instead of just serving it to you.  In terms of food, I would say this is where I was disappointed. There is generally a lack of variety of items especially in the Appetizers and Sashimi section of the menu. With the premium pricing they charge, at places like Shogun and Spoon & Fork would offer premium offerings such as Squid Sashimi, Sweet Shrimp, Octopus Sashimi. None of these items are found aside from the basic: Salmon, Tuna, Red Snapper, and Surf Clam. I would estimate the menu has about 70 items while other AYCE would typically offer 100+ items. I will also mention the plate used for the sashimi looks very cheap and doesn't match the sophisticated decor of the restaurant.  The blow torched sushi is their staple. While it was good, it lacks smokey flavour you would get from real blow torched sushi. Realistically, this is not an item you would consume a lot since it fills you fast with all the rice. I would prefer to have more variety of sashimi which I value at an AYCE Sushi/Sashimi restaurant.   The cooked items were extremely disappointing. The miso soup is very sweet in flavour. The \"lobster\" bisque was medium temperature, I like my soups to be hot. My stir fried seafood udon came with a pile of liquid that tasted like ketchup. I wish I took a photo for you, but it was so disappointing I did not bother. There was even chicken in my \"seafood\" udon. I also ordered a Veggie Udon in broth, the broth tasted sweet and the \"veggie\" udon contained imitation crab meat. Imitation crab meat is typically made out of white fish, so it is ridiculous that an offering of \"veggie\" udon actually contains meat.  All the skewers were very disappointing. They tried very hard to replicate the Yakitori restaurants downtown, but none of the food items had any flavour. The pork belly had no caremlization or searing to it. It tasted very strong of pork flavour. The other grill items looked steamed like the eggplant which is a stable dish or the grilled saury had a pool of water at the bottom. The grilled Okra they drizzled some brown sauce on top that took away from otherwise a good dish. The best cooked dish was actually the baked oyster which I recommend. The quail which is a unique item for AYCE was poorly executed with the spices they used  In terms of ordering, several of our items were missing. We were also given wrong items a lot of times. So the iPad system while fancy, is still subject to human error. The owner/manager would observe the area during the dining experience. He was rushing us near the end that the 9pm reservations have showed up, yet the problem was our desserts were incomplete and missing. He said he would go in the back to get our desserts personally, yet our 4 orders of Hokkaido Brulee never arrived. Being fed up, we got the bill and left without getting our desserts and the failed promise of the owner/manager.  This restaurant is worth checking out at least once, would I go back again? Probably in another year to see if they got their stuff together and if they've improved. Servers or more accurately described as food delivery personnel could use more customer service training. The focus on delivering food takes away from any human interaction. The owner/manager seems very unapproachable as well, often standing in the dining room looking like a drill sergeant of a US Navy Platoon."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed in Kaka. I've heard so many great things about it on Yelp, social media, and friends and I hyped it up for myself for months but the food wasn't as good as I thought it would be. This is a good place to go with friends - really nice interior with a more upscale vibe than the surrounding restaurants and you can't even tell that you're in First Markham Place. Really loud music. Service was overall okay (given that it's an AYCE) and courteous. You'll have an easier time here if you speak Cantonese rather than English.   As we waited for the rest of our group to arrive, servers were going around giving complimentary dishes (like scallops with cheese, and some raw salmon/tuna -  not sure what it was as it was already at the table when I arrived). Pleasantly surprised at that. However, nothing they gave us really stood out to me.  Perhaps the complimentary dishes should have been a sign as to what the actual food we ordered would be like - it wouldn't have been as disappointing if it wasn't so hyped. Kaka is known for its pressed/torched sushi and even advertises it on the front page of the takeout menu. We were excited to order some but when it came it didn't really fulfill our expectations. A few things - really minimal amounts of fish - there was so much more rice - like five times the amount of fish. The rice was also kind of warm and really soft - it fell apart when I tried to pick up the sushi with chopsticks. This is also because the pieces were sliced so thinly. Usually I have photos but not this time as I was with friends - you'll just have to take my word for it.  I know that Kaka is also known for its twists on your regular Japanese AYCE fare and I was excited for this. However, the execution of these ideas fell flat for me. For example, on the torched ika - why is there shacha sauce on it?? I know Kaka is Chinese-run but this was really odd and the flavours didn't really match. Even the agedashi tofu had it's own odd thing going on - there were mushrooms and something like chili oil on it. It tasted okay but whatever new and interesting things Kaka is doing with their food it doesn't seem to add very much to the taste - as in, their additions don't feel like they are necessary. better. Their teppanyaki/teriyaki was average, as was their fried items.   Sashimi was fresh, but not any more so than other good AYCE places. Also, we ordered 45 pieces and they gave us 18. I guess that was a good thing because none of us ate very much because we weren't that into the food. Desserts were okay - again, nothing mindblowing. Again, they have unique menu items but execution is not quite there. The mango lychee slush only tastes like mango. The lychee panna cotta was very thick and milky with little lychee flavor and wasn't very appetizing. The one thing I really liked was the matcha creme brulee. I probably could have eaten a few of those. My friends didn't like the regular vanilla creme brulee.  Overall... for $40 it wasn't worth it. Kaka has interesting menu items but nothing really stood out. Also, we were surprised by the limited menu on a Friday night - the website advertises much more.   (The wi-fi password is their reservation number on the takeout menu.)"}
{"text":"Super average all you can eat sushi place. Service is decent, everything is done on the iPad so you'd think they wouldn't miss certain items...they do. The quality of sushi you're getting is very average for the price you pay, about $85 dollars for two people on a weekend night.   They have these 'special' sushi, where you can get only one per person - those are pretty good but sucks that you can only get one. Their everyday special sushi's are decent too, get the chef frank's roll, that was probably my favourite roll of the night. Items to not get: seaweed salad (very salty), miso soup (no flavour), karaage (all batter). The passion fruit pineapple yogurt dessert thing they had was pretty good too, but it's kind of inconsistent. I ordered it the first time and it was a jelly like consistency which was really tasty so I ordered another one, came out to be watery and not as good..perhaps they didn't have time to fridge it for a longer period.   Overall, glad I tried it but wouldn't go back again."}
{"text":"Sooo delicious. Our orders never take too long and the portions are spot on. No huge chunky rolls of rice and the taste was all very consistent in yumminess! Would go back again and again. My new favorite sushi joint.  A lot the sushi quantities are small so you hardly over order."}
{"text":"Note: this review is purely on the service. As we were unable to get seating, I cannot comment on the food. I mean, it did smell good and the reviews for the food are great! Note to self (and others): make reservations! At least 1-2 days in advance.  We called Sunday afternoon at about 2:00pm to try to reserve a table for 4 that night. They said the restaurant was fully booked until 8:30pm, so we left our name and number in case there were any cancellations for earlier. We arrived at about 5:30pm, to which we were greeted by the hostess. She immediately informed us that \"we're completely booked full until 8:30pm, we will not be able to seat you.\"  This was rather confusing, as there were at least 15 empty seats (I'm underestimating). At this point we resolved to wait for a bit, in case anyone didn't show up for their reservations. The hostess turned to us and again said, \"There is no hope for you. We're completely booked until 8:30pm.\" (Yes those were her words - there is no hope). We decided to sit down and wait regardless. Many others came in to try to get seating, and the phone was constantly ringing - they all received the same response that we did. As we waited 10, 20, 30 minutes...we didn't even get eye contact from the hostess. She did not bother updating us, and eventually I believe she got so uncomfortable that she moved away from her stand near the front entrance to either stand in front of the washroom or help the servers on the floor. She would briefly return to her hostess stand, mostly to answer phone calls and turn other customers down. Not until about an hour later when we asked if we would get seated did she respond again with no, and we instead went to Sushi on 7 where we were immediately served, and with smiles I might add.  As the front of house staff, she completely ruined the restaurant for me. As good as the reviews on Yelp are for this restaurant, if this is the welcome/service (or lack thereof) that I can expect...then don't expect me to come back. She made zero effort into helping us, and kept on repeating that they were completely booked, while we sat facing empty tables for about an hour. Rather than updating us that everyone has shown up for their reservations and that we won't be seated for another x period of time, she avoided eye contact and just decided to leave us sitting there. Once in a while, we would catch her peering at us from her spot near the washroom, as if hoping we would walk out on our own. If we were stubborn, she probably would have left us sitting there all night. Most restaurants are able to accommodate walk ins, especially a small group of 4. This restaurant decided to leave us sitting and waiting; it was as though they had never dealt with walk in customers before. The customer service is therefore, in my opinion, terrible.  I will never intentionally return to this restaurant. If you do, then I repeat: MAKE RESERVATIONS."}
{"text":"Good food, reasonably priced. The place has the wonderful ambiance of a Izakaya (jap bar). The food is above average for a AYCE sushi place.  Only down side was the wait, I tried calling the day before for a booking and it was already fully reserved, so my party of 4 walked-in and waited 2 hours ... as it is a new place, the hype is not over and so there is a lot of people booking tables as well as walk-ins. If you hate waiting and want to eat at between 6 - 8 pm, then you should turn around and go somewhere else.  They also have a some what weird way to operate things as when a table frees up at 7:30 and they have bookings at 8. that table will be left empty until past 8 past. its a little titillating when you've stood there for an hour and you stare at the empty table for 30minutes.  I also don't understand the need to leave a contact number when they won't call u for the table. This aspect of the management still requires some work, though props to Julian, the greeter for his patience! Will definitely come back, given that I do get a reservation next time."}
{"text":"I have decided to downgrade this to 3.5 stars (I rounded up to 4 stars) due to the rapid decline in quality and service. My first visit was grand opening on July 3rd, and second visit on July 13 for my mom's birthday.  The service started out excellent where we came in to people crowding the entrance and asking the hostess a dozen questions. I let her know I had reservations for 4 at 7pm and she sat us right away. She didn't ask for a name or anything. Too bad, doesn't seem like they are keeping track of regulars or possible regulars. Anyway, she sat us at the bar, which isn't very practical for an AYCE. So I told her we were celebrating a birthday, and she quickly accomodated to give us a table. She even mentioned that she could give us a surprise! When we sat down, she wished my mom a happy birthday and said no rush. Her exact words were, 'I will not rush you. Enjoy!'    Complaints on service:  - We were rushed. A waiter came by at least 3 times after an hour asking if we were finished. And when we told him that we were missing some orders, he asked how long ago we ordered, said 30 mins, and he said, it will not come then. That's it. No, sorry, I'll check on it, nothing. Just, 'If it's been that long, it's not coming'. We just looked at him and laughed! No biggie since we can always reorder, but really? Of all things, he chose to respond like that. LOL!  - There was no surprise. Which is fine. I just don't like when people say they will do something and not deliver. Maybe she forgot since it was crazy busy for a Monday.  - Hostess offered us 10% off our bill which we would have gotten it by paying cash or debit anyway (this was my 2nd visit overall). I hope this wasn't the 'surprise'. It was pretty disappointing since she offered another table 15% and another table all they can drink!  - Another rushed moment was when we were quickly handed the bill literally after our last bite into dessert. The waiter said, 'I'm going to give you your bill, there's a lot of people waiting'.    Comments on Food:  - Sashimi is fresh and actually comes in the quantity you order.  - Some new items on the dessert menu: Green tea creme brulee (a miss for us), mango slushy (yums!), berry mousse (didnt try this) and ice-cream (red bean, green tea and vanilla).  - Conch skewers are drenched with sauce and were too burnt.  - Baked avacado and cheese did not look appeitizing at all, it was all gray, muggy and watery. Nothing like from my first visit.  - Spring egg is a must try!    What I really appreciate:  - The hostess tries her best to be as accomodating as possible and always with a smile.  - They respect reservations!    Overall, quality is still better than any other Japanese AYCE in Toronto."}
{"text":"The servers were great and the food came very quickly, but the menu had pretty limited options. Although it's all you can eat, the portions were very small and the rolls only come with 3 pieces which was a little odd, also the quality of them was average. Plus it was a holiday so we were charged $32.99, definitely not worth the price."}
{"text":"Best AYCE sushi in GTA, I love this place so much that I have no problem venturing out east to eat here. The torched and pressed sushi are my go-to orders, especially the spicy salmon and beef tataki aburi. On Friday and weekend dinners they even give you a special plate of various aburi and pressed sushi not on the menu such as scallop aburi. No need to douce it in soy sauce as there is already a special sauce on each piece.   The serving sizes are practical as well as one order of torched/pressed sushi is only one piece, special rolls come in 2 and regular maki comes in 3, which is much better than your typical AYCE restaurant that serves 6-8 pieces so you're able to try a larger variety. Even other dishes such as the fish and shrimp tacos tasted great, where else can you find tacos being served at AYCE sushi.   The prices are higher than most at $32.99 per person for weekend dinner but the quality of the food and the selection stand out. Even the service was great as our orders came out quickly and we were asked on more than one occasion if there was anything missing which they expedited right away. I know that there are those who have issues with the reservation system but as long as you call between 12-6pm, I have never had any issues getting through. Lastly, until June 30th you can \"order the Yelp\" and try their smoked duck sushi for $2.50/piece, worth trying once!"}
{"text":"Came here during opening week and couldn't wait to try it since we love their original Markham location. They do not take reservations for party sizes under 6 so it is first come, first served. We came for a Wednesday dinner so we were seated right away.   One thing that we noticed right away was that this location does not have the iPad menus that Markham has, not sure if this is a permanent thing or because they had just opened. Our server advised us that there were some items that were not available since they were waiting for some ingredients to arrive from Japan.   We tried each of their torched and pressed sushi offerings and they were just as good as their Markham location. The only difference is that I felt like there was a bit more rice on their rolls but this is a new location so I'm sure they're working out the kinks. They have a bunch of items that are unique to downtown and one that I really enjoyed were their tacos. We tried both their beef and fish tacos, and they come in these bite-size shells and taste great. There was a few dessert items that we wanted to try that were unavailable but it just gives us more of a reason to come back."}
{"text":"Seeing so many reviews and having asked people if they all have had tried out this place yet, I finally got the chance to try it out for myself. I have to say I really appreciate the effort and replication of  the oshi & aburi torched sushi that everyone has been raving about. Being able to live out in BC for awhile i've gotten the opportunity to try many sushi places there where they have aburi& oshi torched sushi.   Even though over there its a common thing its new on the east coast because no place really offers this type of sushi except for Miku. But having said that, not everyone will be going to Miku and spending lots of money everytime to just get torched sushi.. This place is probably the best for AYCE in terms of getting aburi  and oshi sushi. Though the quality is not there unlike places that I have tried but it's very good for a AYCE. Kaka is a good place for AYCE specialty sushi.   The menu I personally found is quite average in terms of the items they offer when compared to other AYCE sushi places. Alot of  the same fish, rolls, handrolls and etc that you would find at other places. Again, I like the effort they put in to do the oshi and aburi's in such a quick turnaround to give to their customers.   Unfortunately I wish their lunch price on the weekend was cheaper it was $27 which was the same as the dinner price. Usually isn't lunch normally cheaper? Overall, not bad but menu is nothing too special except for the special sushi."}
{"text":"First things first - if you are coming here for dinner - visit this place in advance by at least two weeks to secure your preferred time slot. If you are coming here for lunch, reservations are not really required, since the menu would be a la carte versus the all-you-can eat dinner extravaganza.   I, personally, found it more expedient to visit the restaurant in person rather than making the reservation by phone. As you can wait for up to a half hour on hold and they'll only take reservations between 10am until 6pm.  Foodwise - for an AYCE place, they aren't bad. I would say that their menu offerings aren't as extensive as some other AYCE places, however I prefer that the menu is smaller and less varied, as it gives them a chance to focus on getting the quality. Few items that were unique to this place is their aburi and torched sushi - they offer 3 different types of these two varieties - worth checking out.  Other decent items are the baked mussels & oysters; their dessert are pretty decent as well.   Service - they explain that all items other than the rolls are typically a 1:1 ration - so it makes it easy for them to keep track; which is a smart move on their part.   Space - it is nice - however I don't find this place to be as baby friendly in the evening as they are during the lunch time. This is primarily due to the fact that they are really busy in the evening. But there is definitely space to accommodate infant car seats along the benches and they are more than willing to help you store the stroller frame up at the front.   Overall - it is a pretty good AYCE place, hopefully they maintain the quality as time wears on. Pricing isn't cheap, but it isn't the most expensive AYCE place in town."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite sushi All You Can Eat restaurant in Toronto. The service was great! I came with my husband, our server Koldin was very nice and the order and food come out efficiently at dinner time. Food / sashimi quality was fresh than we expected.i really love the Aburi sushi, they did a great job! I'll def come again!"}
{"text":"Quality is great for an ayce. Came here on a Sunday night an hour and a half before closing and it wasn't that busy. Upon arrival we were told last call is at 10:20pm since they close at 11pm. They use iPads to order food. I noticed they didn't have a wide variety of sushi rolls compared to other ayce places. The food comes quick. The staff are friendly and always coming around to collect empty dishes. The Salmon Oshizushi is a must to try! The salmon just melts right on your tongue. The Salmon torched sushi is good too but I've tasted better. They also offered free dishes to try which is great because I got to sample them without feeling any guilt that it cost me. I was a little disappointed to see that they don't offer mango ice cream. But I guess to substitute that fact, they offer mango shots.. sorry but it's still not the same. They don't charge you any other charges except for tax. Lastly, the decor is nice, it's a great place for couples, groups, and families."}
{"text":"Came here for their industry night and I have very mixed feelings. The ambiance is modern and clean, and staff are friendly. However, everyone from the hosts, to the servers, to the bartenders seemed SUPER INEXPERIENCED bordering inept (just didn't really seem to know how to do their jobs) when it came to service. As someone who has worked in the service industry, both food and otherwise, I know it can be a challenging job; however, one thing that good Toronto restaurants need (especially with the higher price tag and classier feel) is decent service.   I tried a series of different bites, including a teriyaki type taco, different sushi and maki creations, a tuna tartar, and a lychee creme dessert. It's definitely more millennial-y appealing with more of a \"new-modern\" feel over the traditional sushi basics. Everything was really pretty (some of my food even had gold spray!), and was tasty, but there is heavy use of sauces and lots of cooked pieces.   Would I come back? If I really wanted AYCE sushi, maybe, but I definitely didn't leave wanting more."}
{"text":"This place is so busy that we had to squeeze 12 people in a 8 person table. And the only reason I got a table was because I booked two weeks in advance. That said, was the food good? It was indeed.   The torched sushi that they are known for is great. The sashimi here tasted fresh. The baked oysters are piping hot and yum. The rolls are delicious. The service was fairly responsive despite how busy they were. There were some items that was mediocre on the menu and their desserts while a variety, don't taste the best. That said, stick to what they are known for, which is the fish and you'll be just fine."}
{"text":"I can see the appeal of this place. It is one of the few places that offers Aburi-style sushi at an all you can eat place. But at the end of the day I wasn't too impressed with the food.  Staff: The staff were very attentive, they came by often to clear the plates and the food came quick as well. You order off of a tablet, which I always prefer because often at times when you order with pen and paper something seems to always been \"forgotten\".  Ambience: It's got a modern vibe going for itself. The dark furniture and bright lights was comfortable enough. My party was seated on the side so there was cushioned seats which were nice.  Food: Although they boast a wide selection they were also limited in other ways. For example they didn't have Amaebi (Sweet Shrimp) but they had Oshizushi (Pressed Sushi). They had Ganache Squares for dessert but they didn't have Mango Pudding. Now, I'm definitely up for new foods, but this place lacked refinement. The Deep Fried Scallops had holes poked through all of them (possible for faster cooking?), the Ramen Soup dishes came with a lack of meat/toppings, the Rolls were inconsistent with the sizes, etc.  I will say that this place is a great option for All You Can Eat since this is the only AYCE place I know that has Aburi-style sushi. Unfortunately, like many other AYCE places, I would come here for the quantity rather than quality.  My final points: if you don't care for Aburi-style sushi, the heftier price tag may be a deterrent for you, and you're definitely going to need to try and make a reservation or else they may turn you away."}
{"text":"Made reservation for a Sunday night. We were quickly seated although there were other parties waiting. The place is fairly small compared to other AYCE places.   Came in with high expectation as Kaka is a super hyped up AYCE sushi joint and known for the torched sushi. For the price, I was very disappointed with the quality. There was nothing special about the torched sushi despite the nice presentation. They brought us the weekend special dishes .. which was nothing special at all. (Mussel & clam with cream cheese sauce on top) The rolls did not look fresh and I've had better else where. There was a very small selection of the dessert menu.   Overall, will not be coming back here. Service was good though. But the price was not worth it."}
{"text":"The service here is absolutely garbage.  Stood at the front for 10 mins and no one come to greet or acknowledge that they will serve you in a minute because they r busy atm. The phone was ringing non stop yet no one would answer.   I finally call the number hopefully the reception with the headset on will come to answer the phone, and she did FINALLY.  So after standing there being ignored for over 15 minutes then was told the place is full with lots of empty but probably were reserved. Well it really doesn't matter how great the food is or how popular it is anymore.  The first impression just killed this place for me."}
{"text":"I must say first off that I am giving this place 4 stars on the basis that I am comparing this to all other AYCE places and NOT actual high calibre sushi places (ie: JaBistro, etc.)   Compared to a bunch of AYCE Japanese places, this place is the absolute bomb!  Most of the time, when you come in small groups, they will be able to accommodate you with a reservation.  By small groups, I means groups of 1-3.  If you have more numbers, I suggest you make a reservation b/c weekends are pretty crazy.   The selling point of their place is their torched sushi.  I suggest everyone to give that a try because it is fantastic!  Their salmon and butter fish is fantastic.  Not a lot of AYCE places have torched sushi.  Their sashimi is okay - fresh but like all AYCE places, generally lacks the flavour you get from high quality sushi places.    Otherwise, they have similar other things that AYCE places have with their cooked dishes, salads, soups, small side dishes, etc.  They do however, do an in-house platter for every table, which includes some sushi's that are not available to order on menu.    I've been here a couple times already and would definitely come back in the future!"}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday for lunch. They have all you can eat for lunch and do take reservations. Make sure you called at least one week for lunch ayce reservations. For dinner maybe 2 weeks.  Food was better then most all you can eat. Sizes are smaller portions but I actually prefer this. After all it's all you can eat, if you think portions are too small just order more instead of wasting it.   Lunch was $28.99 which is the price of some dinner places but due to quality I would pay for that prize. The food came relatively on time and they made sure to clear empty plates.  Would definitely come back, but for lunch only as dinner ayce is way too much."}
{"text":"First thought on entering the restaurant was that it is a cool looking space. Love the woven black wall and lighting. Washrooms were clean.  We were told there were no tables for two so we had to sit at the bar but there seemed to be plenty of empty tables for two during the duration of our meal.  We ate: Daily special of tuna and salmon tataki - delicious One scallop in the shell in some cream sauce was yummy but I generally try to avoid too much cream sauce. They made a point of telling us that we only get one when we had not asked for more. Torched and pressed sushi in salmon, shrimp and butter fish - delicious and really great to have that option for an AYCE Various sashimi all of which was good, some oddly shaped Tempura shrimp was crisp and yummy Tempura yam was a standout. Super thin, crispy and perfect. Mango slushy dessert was made fresh and with real mango. Probably the best dessert choice.   So why not four stars? + For $33 per person at an AYCE I do expect more and there were premium offerings - Serving dishes were chipped - Servers kept changing during the meal and it was annoying with each change that they felt it necessary to explain about the daily special again when we did not ask - Stacked cases of pop beside the washroom look sloppy I didn't count against them the dude beside me washing his hands in his teacup, because that's not within their control. ;)"}
{"text":"3.5/5, +.5 for service  Sense certainly didn't last long. One of the weirdest names for a restaurant in Markham, Kaka, has opened in the slot where Sense used to be. However they seemed to have not done much with the decorations, as it was virtually identical with Sense. I do wonder if the same people from Sense is operating this restaurant and they simply changed the name and from an izakaya-like place to an AYCE joint.  Arriving at 8:00pm last night, the place was full house. I had to wait about 15 minutes for a table, but they were quick and accommodating in making sure we get a table.  As typical with newer AYCE places, you order through an iPad. The first thing I noticed: They have blowtorch sushi!!! I believe this is the first sushi restaurant, let alone an AYCE restaurant in Markham to offer blowtorch sushi. If you haven't tried it before, it is a must-try. Some items I ordered the entire blowtorch sushi category, lobster bisque (x7), tuna/ika/hokkigai/ebi/beef sashimi, several assorted skewers, beef ribs, and the chocolate custard desserts.  There was a reason why I ordered 7 lobster bisques: They were some of the best I've had for an AYCE joint, and I've had legit lobster bisques in various coastlines. There's no lobster in them, but the soup more than makes up for it. The blowtorch sushi was done beautifully, and currently they are doing a special where if you order enough, they will give you free scallop blowtorch sushi, which tasted even better than the ones you can order. The sashimi plate wasn't anything too special, especially given the competition set by the blowtorch sushi. The beef ribs and the chocolate custard desserts were decent.  Our initial order of skewers never arrived. After asking the server and double checking the kitchen, he told us to order it again as it was lost in the process. There was also confusion with two servers serving us at the same time at one point, but that was eventually cleared up. So there's still some quirks to work out, but the service was definitely up to par.  Definitely will come back! 10% off cash and debit payments."}
{"text":"Great sushi, especially the torched kind! However other non-sushi isn't that special, I would find it average at best.  The service is mediocre, but being able to order on a tablet is a plus.  It was also annoying to book a table and hard to call in given how busy the place is, even on a weekday!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place. Finally went there at around 9:15pm on a weeknight. The restaurant was packed and the host could not give me a wait time and last call was at 10:30pm. Still we waited, and I guess I lot of people did not bother waiting as we were seated at around 9:50pm.    The server gave us the digital menu, and that was it. There was no instructions.  We didn't know that the order wasn't sent to the kitchen until 15 min later because we pressed the wrong button for sending the order.  Also, the pictures on the digital menu were very misleading.  You were actually ordering only 1 pc of an item, even though the picture may depict 2 or 3.  I will say that all the servers we interacted with were really friendly.   The food arrived at the table at a good pace.  All the fish were very thin and very small.  The blowtorched sushi, albeit different, tasted just okay.  Sure, there was that hint of char, but not much else.  There were a few things I found that were pretty good (beef enoki roll, torched beef sushi roll),but all of them were very small.  The only excuse I could think of would be that it was near closing, they had a full house and so they were busy and controlling how much people were ordering.  Overall it was a disappointing experience.  Would I pay $25 there again?  No.  But if someone I was hanging out with really wanted to come here, I wouldn't be against it."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant few times in the past two years!  No more line up compare from b4!  Price increase almost every visit which i can understand because food and labour cost go up a lot!  However, the menu get smaller and smaller every time!  Too bad!  My family and I decided not to go again since last week visit!  Two stars for the service!"}
{"text":"I have such mixed feelings about KaKa. It has a lot of good points but also a lot of bad points... too bad, otherwise it'd be a pretty great AYCE restaurant.  If you don't make a reservation, you can easily wait for 30-40 minutes for a table. You also have to write down your order number and amount, as opposed to an iPad ordering system like most AYCE places. Ok, sure- that's fine. The thing is, the servers will normally give you less than you ordered. If you wanted 15 pieces of sashimi, you'll probably end up with 5 or something. This happened every occasion I visited KaKa; I guess no one has complained about it since it happens each time.   It's really expensive, too- around $40 including tax and tip. I don't know if I ever order enough to justify that price tag, so I suppose it's more of a \"special occasion\" to venture here for dinner.  I do think the food is very good though! They have a great range of sashimi, rolls, and desserts. I always get salmon and butterfish sashimi. The crême brulée is awesome too, so make sure to stock up on that. DON'T order the tacos, they come in a really cheap shell and is drenched with odd sauce. I don't really like their red meat options either (personal preference), so it's really the sushi that are the superstars here!   I would come back in a few months... after my stomach has recovered from bingeing on too much sashimi."}
{"text":"It is a Japanese all you can eat restaurant. iPad menu and order. Cooked food taste well, at least for me. Fish sashimi is very fresh. You can feel the fish melts in your mouth. But the disadvantage is there are not many choices in the menu as an all you can eat restaurant. And the price is very expensive but not including any soft drinks."}
{"text":"My first visit to Kaka was pleasant overall. For a Japanese theme AYCE, it's cooked food (grills) selection is weirdly better than its sushi bar's offerings. Not sure if we were there on a bad day but their sake (salmon) sashimi was 'bland'. Not stale yet not the freshness.   In general, Kaka employs the philosophy of using superior cooking skills to complement their more 'cost effective ingredients' used. Service was prompt and smaller portion size was ideal for AYCE.   At $28.99++, I might return."}
{"text":"I have wanted to try this place for a very long time from a friend's recommendation. My friend took me here and iw as very amazed that they use I pads to.order . Thought that was very innovative thing that they created. We ordered a ton of food. Their blowtorched sushi was delicious and we ordered their unique rolls line honey mustard I thought it was out of the box but a little weird their beef sashimi is very good and thw green tea creme brulee and ice cream was amazing . I really liked their service and the ipads are super cool"}
{"text":"People keep raving about the torched sushi at Kaka all over Yelp and social media. Tried Kaka for the first time and oh boy, I was traumatized. The torched sushi did not taste good AT ALL and the party lost their appetite from eating the torched sushi. The fish used on the torched sushi was not fresh and tasted sour, and I almost threw up while eating it.   The other food at Kaka was alright. The desserts were really good. However, sashimi wasn't very fresh today.   The ambiance of the restaurant is nice. There is a long line up and wait if you don't make a reservation. Good that the restaurant accepts debit and credit cards. The service is okay depending on which waiter/waitress serves you. The waiters are more pro-active and bring you the things you need while the waitresses keep forgetting what you need."}
{"text":"Listen I get it you have great food and you try to interact with customers and come around every 2 mins asking if everything is okay, but common I order 15 pieces of torched sushi and you bring 4.  I order 15 more pieces and you bring 4, I understand you dont want to waste food but when a customer orders a certain number of items you have bring it.  Also you NEED TO CHANGE YOUR WASABI, that crap you are serving is weak. I used a whole bowl of it and still had no kick.  Other then that great food, great torched fish, butter fish, and lamb skewers are highlights."}
{"text":"For an AYCE that markets premium experience with a price tag to match at $34.99 on weekdays, Kaka downtown Toronto was a major disappointment. Service was underwhelming from the moment we set foot into the restaurant after a 45 min wait - technically lacking since it was the diners at the next table who gave us menus and ordering slips ... before we even got water which was about 10 mins later.  My friend has eaten at the Markham location and the disparity on appeal, freshness and taste is like the sky and a bottomless pit.  Option nearby provides better value for money. Kaka downtown has really ruined the reputation the Markham location built.   The seaweed salad was watery, the salmon not fresh torched or raw, and the tempura was downright greasy. Torched sushi, which is supposed to be Kaka's signature, was a blob of lightly baked mayo. One piece would be ok torched while another same piece is torched at the top of the concave only with raw parts still showing.  Avoid creme brulees as the texture is not appealing.  Ok earl grey flavour but sugar was partly torched (light brown in the center with solid piece of clear sugar covering rest of the ramekin) and very off on texture which is more in-line with thinly mixed batter.  The panna cotta was ok but the lychee sugar on top I could have gone without. The ultimate tipping point was the quality of service which was slow, unattentive and peculiar.   They let food sit on the serving shelve longer than expected which affected taste of food.  Also, saw a water take a half drank carafe of water and pour it into the communal water jug they use to fill diner cups... which was also filled directly from tab (not through a filter).  I will never go back and nothing in my dinner experience is recommendable."}
{"text":"The sushi here is top notch! I scored the stars mostly based on the food. They have a lot of amazing items that are not found at other sushi ayce places down town. Their selection of aburi sushi, pressed sushi, and all the different tataki are all well thought out and delicious. Their fish is amazingly fresh, my favorite was the ika (aka squid).  Another thing I love about this ayce is their dessert! The chocolate custard, panna cotta with sake jelly, and green tea creme brulee all had the perfect balance of richness, sweetness, and flavor. Definitely try to leave some stomach space for these.    That being said, there are a lot of kinks in the service, being understaffed, and understocked on the 10th day after grand opening. The main thing I would love to see improved is more consistent availability for the different menu items, or at least some communication from the servers about what is and isn't available. It's very frustrating to see all the great items on the menu, only to be told after 20 min of ordering that they are not available. This just feels like ordering unicorn farts. Also doesn't make sense to say that there are weekend special items when weekday prices are the same.  I'm looking forward to coming regularly after all the kinks are ironed out."}
{"text":"I have been to Kaka a handful of times, and I come here every 1-2 months to serve my sushi cravings. I still have to say that Kaka is probably one of the best (if not best) ayce SUSHI place to go to. Note that I highlight the sushi part because the cooked items are very mediocre. I don't mind that as I can only eat so much and I personally prefer eating sushi than cooked food for Japanese food anyways - that's why I always come back here and felt that the extra pricing for weekend dinner was justified.   Unfortunately, not for this time. I always looked forward to their creativity because while the weekend dinner is more expensive than any other ayce joints in the GTA, it includes some special items (three extra types of torch/pressed sushi - and the torched squid is usually amazing but wasn't available this time :((( ) as well as some special one time items. In the past they were artfully plated and the servers would explain the dishes enthusiastically. This time around, not only was it the same marinated sashimi as months ago, the servers simply dropped it off, making me wonder whether if those are some other table's order that was mistakenly placed on my table.   It's very sad to see a downhill of a very nice restaurant, which has lost their initial passion and creativity. I would probably still come here once in a while, but not for their weekend dinner as it is not worth the hefty price anymore and will be exploring other sushi joints in the GTA."}
{"text":"I think my family had to book reservations a month or more in advance for us to finally try out the place.  When we arrived, we waited around 30 minutes to finally get seated as they had somehow managed to record a wrong reservation time. Once seated, there were the IPad ordering menus which made it easy to visualize what we were ordering.   So many people have raved about this place but to be honest, I was underwhelmed. In fact, I have had similar blow-torched sushi before and didn't understand what the big deal was. The menu options were quite typical to any other AYCE joint but one thing that actually stood out to me was the random pasta dish they offered. Overall, if you haven't tried aburi sushi and want AYCE for it, come to KaKa but everything else is just basic. Service is okay and I guess it's worth a one time splurge but other than that, I will probably not be returning."}
{"text":"Alright, so I went to a Yelp event at KaKa AYCE and met some mighty fine Yelpers.  It was a fantastic tasting event, well organized and lots of food, however many of us Yelpers have reserved our opinions that night because we realized that the restaurant was just opening and the owner seems really enthusiastic about the opening.  The owner shared his vision of this downtown KaKa AYCE location to be a more upscale version as compared to the Markham location.  I can see where they are trying to go with this as it has a prime location and the renovation of the restaurant is quite nice.  The combination of the food and drinks was awkward.  I can see the intent behind some of the items trying to be more upscale, but it was like the chef who designed this menu got a little too creative without actually tasting some of these dishes.  We gave some honest opinion about the lychee mixed drink being too sweet (lychee liquor is already sweet, add grenadine for some nice pink colour, but then you're just drinking sugar).  I also grimaced at the dish with truffle oil drizzled on top of sashimi that did not look so fresh.  I'm not even going to get into the roll with asparagus, mayonnaise wrapped in sashimi.  It still seemed like a fine establishment that can recover, so I decided to host a lunch for my work team here.  I was curious about the AYCE torch sushi.  They did not take reservations for groups of less than 6.   When I came back on a weekday lunch I found out that they no longer offered an AYCE lunch menu.  We ordered a la carte, and the one roll that I would recommend would be the Chef Frank's roll.  We also had the poke roll and that was good too (pictures shown).  If you go here, definitely order these.  Don't order anything with truffle oil, or anything that sounds creative (coming from someone who is a very adventurous eater).  I was disappointed that they charged for regular green tea that would typically be free anywhere else.  Usually when sushi restaurants charge for green tea, it's something a bit more upscale and they would usually leave the tea bag in."}
{"text":"I don't usually do AYCE sushi but I'm so glad I tried Kaka.  Hands down my new fav AYCE sushi.  Pros: Lots of items to choose from (including items usually not at AYCE sushi) Great ordering apparatus Excellent service  Cons: Very busy place  We came here for a lunch on Saturday.  We didn't have a reservation but luckily there was one table left unreserved when we got there right at opening time.  This place is super popular and busy.  If you don't have a reservation, chances are you won't get in, it's just that popular.  Prices are the same for lunch and dinner Monday through Thursday.  It's only different on Friday to Sunday dinner which offers more at a higher price.  The regular price is $26.99 which may seem high, but it's well worth it.  To start, you order everything on an Ipad.   All the items are listed by categories and you select whatever you want.  I love ordering this way.  You get to see pictures of everything you order.  Also, all orders are for one piece other than rolls where one order is 3 pieces.  This ensures you get what you want and exactly how much you want.  If I only want 3 dumplings I get 3 dumplings instead of settling for whatever the set number is at other places.    As well as the usual fare of sashimi, sushi, roll etc, they have a bunch of other items available that you usually don;t see at other AYCE sushi places.  Items like takoyaki, lamb skewers and grilled eggplant are available. There are also tons of desserts that you don't find at other places too. The exclusive item here is the torched sushi.  They torch your usual sushi with a flame.  It gives it a completely different texture.  I liked it and I know people who don't exactly like the raw taste of fish will definitely welcome it.  Overall, the items here are all very well done.  You can't expect omakase quality at AYCE, but Kaka does a very good job.  The service here was excellent.  The hostess at the front was very nice and answered all our questions without hesitation and made sure we were OK throughout our time there.  I have read in past interviews that there are 2 hour limits and they start to rush you out.  2 hours in my opinion is more than enough.  We were there for an hour and 30 minutes and ate comfortably even when it got really busy. Not once did we feel we were pressured to go faster.  All in all, this place is great!  Like I said, it's not going to be as good as Kaji or something similar.  But for a AYCE sushi place, this place is as good as it gets for me."}
{"text":"Instantly became one of my favourite sushi places. Everything was so good I can't even. A lot of things on their menu. And they have one of the best dessert menu for an ayce sushi place.   We tried all the torch sushis and they're all amazing. I personally like the fish ones better. But they had duck option which is not something you usually get at other sushi places. Sashimi was fresh. Although when we asked for 20 salmon sashimi they only gave us 11. Not sure why they do that. But not a big deal since we can just order more. Their beef tataki is one of my fav thing to get. It was perfection. Their chef franks special sushi was amazing because you instantly taste the torched flavour when you put it in your mouth. They also put a lot of effort in plating. Its almost fine dining looking.   Service was fast and servers were friendly.   It is on the pricey side. $35.99 for dinner. So it was about $45 for me after taxes and tips. Definitely not a place I can afford to go often but I would definitely come back when I feel like splurging and having good torched sushi."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for dinner and was hyped and excited to try as it was listed as \"one of the best ayce in town\". This could not however be further from the truth. First, the sushi was big to eat for one bite as it was filled with rice. Second, the torched food doesn't look and taste as \"torched\". Third, the choices were very limited considering you have to pay for a good amount of price. Fourth, we would love to try their mango slush, unfortunately, their machine was broken, as per the waitress. Lastly, the main reason we tried Kaka was because of the specials but we werent informed during reservation that it was only limited per person. There's so much more better ayce elsewhere. By the way, this is my first yelp review."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch today as a party of 2 with no reservations. We walked in the unlocked door and found there to be about 5-6 waitstaff and one table occupied by someone that could have been a patron or staff. Within a few seconds of entering the restaurant, almost all of the waitstaff made eye contact with us, then proceeded to carry on without greeting us. A short while later, a female waitstaff ( w/ a high pony tail, no glasses) walked from in front of the sushi bar into the kitchen, shaking her head while shouting at us in a nasty tone, \"TWO MINUTES!\".   It was at this point that we realized it was actually 11:58am, and that the restaurant was not open for lunch yet. I can't tell you why the door wasn't locked until they opened, but I can tell you that we left with an awful feeling about this place. We used to love Kaka, but it has been going downhill since it opened. Today's experience is the last straw.  I went from telling everyone that this is the best ayce sushi restaurant in all of the GTA, to now telling you all now that this business will no longer have my regular patronage."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. Extremely slow service and tiny portion of food. After you finish one dish and you need to wait like 10 mins for another one to come. So at the end my sister and I just don't want to wait for food anymore and left."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place because of all the pictures I see on my Instagram and Facebook feed. It seems like my friends enjoyed it and this place seems to be innovative with some of their offerings. Unfortunately I am disappointed.   I do not expect much from AYCE sushi but I do expect to be comfortable when I dine. Unless I willingly walked into a hole in a wall then I wouldn't complain about sanitary issues. Kaka is newly renovated and their prices are among the highest in AYCE sushi, I expected more.   We came a couple of weeks ago during lunch hour and they offer bentos or AYCE, it was not busy at all.   When they first gave us our table I noticed it was uneven and it kept wobbling. My friend could not put her hands or arms on the table because it was so uneven. We switched to the next table, it was still the same. Then my friend had to play musical chairs because the chairs were filthy and she was struggling to find a clean chair. You can see the stains and who knows what on the chairs and it was disturbing. I sat on the other side with all the cushions. It looks comfortable and inviting but upon further inspection the pillows were just as filthy as the chairs. There were stains on them and I had to push them aside.   I do not feel comfortable eating raw food in such an establishment. I do not know how clean their kitchen is but looking at the front I am worried."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with my family on a weekday. I was not a fan of their booking system - only answers calls certain times of day, but still hardly picks up the phone within said hours, really seemed like they don't care for your business. We got a brief tutorial on how to order by iPad, but it's still counterproductive since it requires a server to physically come and give confirm the order. Food is good, on par with other sushi AYCE. When they first opened, I recall a lot more special selections (like pork belly, carbonara) you don't see anywhere else, buy those seemed to have disappeared. The new selection seems slightly limited in comparison. Food came fast and most orders were fulfilled. Not bad, just nothing special aside from the interior design and iPad ordering."}
{"text":"Was super excited to try Kaka based on all the photos and reviews I've seen on Yelp and from other friends. My friends made a reservation for 8pm (apparently 7pm time slot is for walk ins). We were seated right away in a nice spot. We got the complimentary sushi starter that they give every table. Super good torched sushi. I told my friends they purposely did this to fill us up lol.   We ordered various items on their menu. Definitely enjoyed the torched pressed sushi the best. Amazing quality and delicious. I was not impressed by the sashimi selection and quality. Was definitely hoping for more selection and better tasting.   I guess the best thing about this place is that they don't give you too much per portion you order (so you don't waste as much food) but some portion sizes were a little ridiculous (i.e. Chicken wing was miniature and half sized). I also enjoyed their dessert selection. My faves were the mango lychee slush served in those shot glasses and the green tea creme brûlée. Other good items worth mentioning are the lamb skewers and ox tongue. Friends said it was good. I tried a bit and thought that it was good despite not being my first good choice.   I'd definitely be back for more torched sushi. Although I think they need to step up their sashimi game."}
{"text":"Managed to get reservations for a Friday night at 8pm for a party of 6..called a week in advance and surprisingly got thru right away!  We got our table around 8:15pm and heard that the place was fully booked..though I did see some people who didn't have a reservation eventually got seated as well.  To start off, this place is pricey! We were charged 15% gratuity for having a party of 6 or more.. came out to $41 per person.  Now off to the food and service.. with the iPad ordering, it was very simple and efficient..food came within a reasonable time. We ordered way too much the first time around..the food seemed to keep coming!  The mango slush was amazing..I wish they would just offer that as a drink..as I found myself ordering them in 2's and 3's throughout my meal. The crème brulees were also delicious and creamy.. I really enjoyed the matcha flavoured one.  The sashimi/torched and pressed sushis were all great, the presentation was amazing as well. The fish was fresh and fish were cut to generous sizes.  Some of the cooked food was just meh.. such as the takoyaki and ramen.. didn't try too much of these though as I was more focused on all the sushi available!  Overall, I'm not sure whether I would come here without an occasion as some planning ahead is needed.. (to make the reservation) along with the price tag.. I'd much rather drop by Kiku or something; Kaka is definitely worth trying though."}
{"text":"For an AYCE sushi restaurant, they aren't a bad choice. However, it comes with a few flaws... they are super crazy busy and making reservations isn't as easy, at least the last few times we've tried. If you are a large party, plan to call them way in advance, as in, 3 weeks. Don't bother dropping in for dinner, you'll either wait for hours or never make it to dinner.   Service has been consistently ok, not amazing nor have they ever been rude. The food selection is pretty good for both lunch and dinner hours as well. Lunch menu is a la carte and dinner is AYCE.   Their specialty is their torched sushi. Not bad at all. Thinking about it makes me want some for lunch right now... haha  but their cooked items are pretty yummy as well.  I don't need to go back but, I will visit them every now and then still."}
{"text":"Pros: They have pretty good customer service, most of the waitresses there are very nice and polite, always checking up on you. They're not too slow when it comes to delivery. Their new \"every day special items\" includes these 3 delicious items WHICH ARE NOT ALWAYS AVAILABLE.. so why is it even called \"every day\" special items lmao. They have a wide variety of izakaya items. Their sashimi is fresh and torched sushi are yummy.  Cons: Not worth it's price. Also, they should really upload their menu online like all the other Japanese ayce restaurants. It's so annoying how they include all these items on their menu but yet it's always unavailable... like how the hell is the mango slush dessert unavailable, especially when it isn't even busy. I find that most ayce places include a larger selection of sashimi, such as ika, ebi, and scallop. There were quite a few times when they kept delivering food to us which we didn't order or sometimes the items just don't come at all. It's either fast or it's non existent. It's very inconsistent.   I've been here at least 10 times and honestly, my rating goes down each time (even though they now occasionally serve those 3 delicious items but it still doesn't make up for everything else). I come back after hearing all these bad things about this place and knowing that the prices went up because I do really want to like this ayce restaurant, but kaka really isn't helping the case."}
{"text":"My expectations were high going into this which is why I was a bit disappointed after my experience here, so I waited a bit until I wrote this review. I think they still deserve the 5 star in retrospect. I had to book 2 weeks in advance and I'm not sure if they take walk-ins at all. Customer service is great from the greeting, service throughout the meal, checking in, and saying bye with smiles. Decor pretty and clean. Table was wobbly but server promptly did a diy fix with napkins. One chair was broken which we notified the server before we left. I think this was an anomaly. I was disappointed because I kept selecting items off the ipad menu, only to see that many of them came up as 'not available', leaving me frustrated. It was a Friday evening so there was no reason for this. I couldn't experience their baked avocado seafood for example. Well, moving past the perceivably limited menu, the food is pretty good. Many things were just good, and some items were spectacular.   1. spring egg - if you like eggs and refined cooking omg this is a must. I think I had 3. Warm gooey goodness. 2. Lobster bisque - the creme fraiche.. oh wowwwww!! I had 4 haha!!  3. they included a free set of 4 torched sushi for everyone at the table close to the beginning of the meal.. scallop, salmon, beef and i think a tuna. Excellent. Scallop was the one thing you couldnt order off the menu and the tuna i believe? These are nice and oily/fatty so you can't really eat too many anyway. 4. the pressed sushi was not bad. The shrimp and salmon ones especially, but it didn't satisfy my pressed sushi desires. Not as good as Jabistro ones. But to have this at ayce, of course the value is there. I'm anticipating Miku's grand opening for their pressed sushi.. straight from Van :)  5. all the desserts were elevated, real cocoa powder too, and the ganache truffles were divine. I really liked their mango greek yogurt and mango lychee slush shooter.   Other things to note.. okra is nice, not a big fan of the peanut sauce though. oh and eel sushi wasn't good.. it came out hard and cold as if it were left sitting for too long. Takoyaki was yummy. Ox tongue skewer was a good mix of tender and chewy, but pork was kinda dry. The baked oysters/muscles were a bit too cheesy for me, and the oysters a bit overcooked. I prefer the baked scallops over at syogun, although they also tend to be a bit overcooked. Will definitely return!!! *note: compared to previously taken yelp pics, our pressed sushi looks wimpier (smaller) and there is only a selection of 4 torched sushi now. I didnt get to try so many things on their menu because they werent available for whatever reason.."}
{"text":"When we first sat down we got complementary miso yuzu salmon and tuna which was delicious! Unfortunately, it was all downhill from there. The salmon teriyaki was very dry and fishy. The beef ramen tasted like chicken noodle soup. There was something hard, maybe a lemon seed, on my shrimp. Overall, the food was pretty bland.   As for the service, the food came pretty quickly which was nice. Most of the staff was friendly with the exception of two or three that were a little 'snobby'. We also received multiple thing that we did not order. Definitely the worst ayce sushi place I've ever been to. I've been to much better ayce places for much cheaper too."}
{"text":"It's good and they have GREAT options. But $35 per person for lunch is absolutely ludicrous no matter what you serve...and ESPECIALLY if you're gnna limit some of the items."}
{"text":"I think giving a four star to an all you can eat sushi is very hard. However, I think this KaKa location deserves it. Overall, the food quality was great...I am personally most impressed with the quality you can get for Aburi Sushi. Given the require care needed for these sushi, KaKa is able to prep them quickly and provide to your table very efficiently.  Another reason our experience was extremely pleasant, it was because we had a very kind waiter, Koldin. He is a nice man who cares a lot about each table he is servicing (which is something you will always never get going to these type of restaurant). If you have a chance to be served by him, you'll definitely enjoy your visit."}
{"text":"worst receptionist ever, book my reservation a week in advance in person on a thursday, when we walked in on thursday your reservation was changed to the past tuesday, and not apologetic about it at all."}
{"text":"My husband and I can never eat sushi the same way again after having smoked/torched sushi in Japan. Smoke/torch the whole menu please! When we learned that there is an ayce in GTA that offers unlimited smoked/torched sushi, we knew we had to make a reservation asap!   However, soon we were greeted by disappointment after learning the available selections upon seating. There were only 3 types of torched sushi available (salmon, tuna, and beef). In addition, many of the menu items were not available surprisingly on a Friday night (so much to charging full price).   Back to the torched sushi - one would expect far greater \"smoked\" flavor from appearance. Compared to the ones we had in Japan, the smoked flavor was almost nonexistent. They were also served cold? Perhaps the smoked flavor had long escaped from sitting on the counter for way too long before being served.   The specialty sushi all tasted the same since they were all pretty much doused with the same spicy mayo or sweet soy/eel sauce. Thankfully they only came in two pieces. Everything else we had was pretty standard and forgettable. Appetizers -  I do recommend takoyaki, fried quail, and spring egg.   Overall - I would save my money to go to a la carte restaurant and get authentic smoked/torched sushi."}
{"text":"So fresh! And everything came so quickly. The dessert mango slush was amazing. I have not been to a lot of AYCE places so it sucks that this is so far from me..otherwise, I'm sure I'd go more often"}
{"text":"I'd say a solid 3.5-4*, especially to go as an \"experience\", with a group, and have a coupla people who can eat their fair share of food.  ;)  Service was good, iPad ordering was efficient, food was solid, but I just can't gorge like I used to.  It just doesn't make me feel great.  However, if you can eat, tons of sushi, rice, & a bunch of other stuff, this place is for you.  Btw, there is more than enough on their menu to choose from.  Sadly, Kaka blows every AYCE sushi place in my city out of the water.  I'll definitely admit that.  They've cornered the market in terms of their torched/pressed sushi that I haven't seen anywhere 'cept for Vancouver.  I don't think I'd voluntarily go just because I can't eat that much, but I wouldn't be upset either if a friend/family held a celebration there!"}
{"text":"Still rmb how wonderful kaka used to be (recommended to so many ppl - I was a reeeeal fan) but very disappointed to say the last two times I went it's Crap...both quality and variety went down hill....during the second to last visit the main differences were: quality of salmon got waaay worse.. no more albacore tuna(use butterfish now)..but just last week I went again and the quality declined soooo much that I don't even recognize this place anymore! - no more oysters..no more special sushi on weekends (they used to give out a sushi platter which has for example scallop sushi yellowtail sushi)...tempura batter has that chicken taste in it(probably used those chicken msg stuff) ...and even sth like the beef teriyaki was no longer the same (use a way lower grade of beef) ..for the higher than normal jap ayce price...not recommended at all..gave it a second chance ..not going back :("}
{"text":"Second time eating here now, first time was not long after KaKa just opened. at that time food was amazing and quality was good. We decided to dine here for our New Year's Eve dinner remembering how good it was last time.. however the quality and selection has definitely went downhill especially for the price of $32.99 !!!  The worst part is, the next day 2 of us ended up having food poisoning. 2 days of throwing up and upset stomach. Def not returning here again."}
{"text":"After hearing so much about this sushi place (with the unfortunate name), YelpGTA community director Kris took me here for dinner so we could feast like the gods and feast we did.   We arrived just before closing time, and even though some might think that may have been to our disadvantage. I might just say, it was to our advantage. The restaurant was empty. The staff was more than willing to accommodate us and walk us through the menu, taking their time to explain how and why we needed to order specific things. I mean, that could also be read in two ways: they wanted to get us out and make sure we didn't come back to order more (lol).   The iPad ordering system is pretty incredible, but also a little bit confusing. For starters, we were unaware that 1 meant 1 piece and not 1 order. So when you're ordering, don't be afraid to tap on that number a lot. Sometimes it's hard to click through on the buttons. You may need to get your server to come over and manually put the order in for you, which is also totally fine.   As for the sushi itself, totally fine. I would say that their seared and pressed sushi is where it's at, so try all of them. They had tons of options for sashimi, which was great. It was also totally fresh and delicious.   Overall, I was pretty impressed with my visit and can't wait to come back another time when I'm not pressed for time.  Now I totally get the hype!"}
{"text":"The food & selection (4.5/5): Best AYCE Japanese restaurant I've tried yet. We went during Asia Fest (happened April 29 to May 15) and they offered a few special sushi and dishes only for this period of time. The food selection is wide, especially the types of rolls they offer. The sashimi there was the thickest I've seen at AYCE and their seared/torched sushi were tasty. I also enjoyed their mango peach slushy served in shot glasses. The only thing I didn't like was their shrimp dishes; we ordered grilled shrimps and shrimp tempura which both happened to be mushy. Their desserts were a little disappointing too. But overall food is good,  especially if you love sushi, sashimi and rolls.  Cost (4/5): $32.99+tax per person, so it came out to around $41 after tax and tips. On the pricey side for a dinner, but it's certainly worth it because of the wide selection, amount of food you get and the better quality among all AYCE's you can find here in the GTA.  Service (4/5): Staffs were quite friendly and attentive. They use the iPad system which you are able to see the photos of food so you know what to expect and it's more efficient. Food came out really quickly after we sent in the order, despite it's so busy (it was a Friday night). They were also very accurate with the order, i.e. we get the exact amount of what we order (a lot of the other places I went to often give you either more or less than what you ask for). Everything is one piece per order (except some smaller rolls, which come in 6 pieces) to minimize the waste of food and also the confusion.   Ambience (3.5/5): The place was really busy. It was 8pm and we had to wait for about 10 min even with a reservation. There wasn't enough space near the waiting area. The restaurant itself is also not very spacious. We were really close to the table next to us and we constantly ran out of table space (but I understand this part / it's unavoidable because it's AYCE and their food came out REALLY fast)."}
{"text":"I like the food! More desserts needs to be added and soup. Better service and seating will bring this place up."}
{"text":"I kept hearing about this place so I finally checked it out. My gf and I got there at 4:40pm and were told we could only stay until 6pm as all the tables are reserved at that time. This was totally acceptable since it takes a while to reserve a seat at this restaurant.  We sat down and placed our order through an iPad which seems quite the standard now for AYCE restaurants. Once placing our order we waited 7-8min to receive the seaweed / soup sides. The restaurant was at 35%-40% capacity so I was not sure what took so long.  For an AYCE the food is average, and service is satisfactory.  Pros: Sushi has less rice than other AYCE restaurants, good but limited selection to choose from, great atmosphere, great location, best desert selection ever.  Cons: Torched sushi wasn't anything to write home about, the specialty rolls sounded great but all looked the same when they came out. A few sushi dishes looked rushed and didn't have good presentation like other AYCE restaurants, takoyaki balls were too crispy on the outside. Overpriced at $30.99 per person before tax and tip.  If I had one word to describe Kaka AYCE it would be overrated. Both my gf and I felt the torched sushi wasn't as good as their regular sushi and this is what is suppose to set them apart from other AYCE sushi joints!. She's tried torched sushi elsewhere and said it was considerable better than here. The white tuna torched sushi to me tasted better than both the torched salmon and beef, I had to force eat those for the sake of not wasting food.  Even though I had my fill, my sushi craving was not satisfied after leaving this restaurant. Would I dine here again? In short, no and I probably won't recommend this place either.  There's just too much hype about this place and I don't believe people are getting their value for the price they pay."}
{"text":"Really good food, and the service was quick, friendly, efficient, and ready to assist! Probably one of the best customer service I have seen at an AYCE restaurant!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Markham location a few times now. My last visit was two weeks ago. I was super excited that they opened a Toronto location and was looking forward to trying it out. The location itself is great... they're located near the Eaton center which is very convient for Ryerson students. The space itself is a lot more spacious than their Markham location. My friend has made a reservation for 5 people for 5:30pm. Apparently the restaurant couldn't find our reservation and said they were full. They accommodated our party however, the restaurant wasnt even full when we got there.   I originally wanted to give them 1.5 stars but it's not an option. The reason I rated so low was a lot of the hot foods came to our table cold. A lot of items were not available. The torched sushi was obviously the highlight but I didn't find it worth it. After tax and tip it came to $43 per person. I would have rather eaten uptown or at the keg for the quality of food that was provided at this location. The service was good but I was definitely disappointed at the quality for the amount I was paying! All in all I wouldn't ever come back"}
{"text":"This sushi place was awesome. A little on the pricey side but worth it. Food amazing!   Only reason I'm giving it a 4  star instead of a 5 star is  bc I found there was way too much sauce on their rolls and cooked food. If they toned the sauce down, then 5 star easily    Our server was Anita, she came with a smile every time. Her service alone was enough to make us come back here. She is awesome. Thanks Anita!!!  Kaka we will be back"}
{"text":"It's not really AYCE when you limit certain things. Plus the instructions for what items are had limits in how much you can order is not clear at all. Items that we ordered sometimes didn't show up as well. Not sure if they were just cancelling or hoping we wouldn't notice. The ipad ordering was fun through. Only giving 3 stars because it doesn't feel like it was worth $30+"}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite AYCE sushi places. This place is always packed, without reservations I think seating time is only 1.5hours whereas with reservations it's 2 hours. Therefore, its better for make reservations to have a true experience.   Servers are attention, food is served pretty quick. You order with an ipad.   They offer a larger variety of food than most places. Most things on the menu is similar to other AYCE restaurants. But the unique thing about them is that they have a torched sushi. They have torched salmon, mackerel, shrimp and beef. These items are a must try if you visit. They are pretty delicious but not top tier like the ones at Miku.   As for their sashimi, their sashimi has been always fresh. There is no fishy smell or anything. I also love the fried salmon belly, it is extremely soft and delicious. A little fatty though.  Lastly, dessert! Dessert here is alright. Nothing too special. They have crème brule and match crème brule. I felt like the texture was not thick enough, it was thin and did not taste like crème brule. It tasted more like pudding?   Overall, great place for AYCE! May be a little pricier than other AYCE but totally worth."}
{"text":"finally, we booked a table in kaka and tried their famous torched sushi The atmosphere is good, better than other ayce, however, the tables are too close to each other which made it awkward coz we can clearly hear every sentence that ppl sitting next to us said. The torched sushi is good, fresh and unique Sashimi here is not fresh but we finished all of the sashimi we ordered since we didn't want to waste  Dessert here is freaking good! First time try lavender choco mousse, and it became my new love!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice for dinner and I gotta say, it's really good. What makes this place special from the other AYCE places is that they offer torched sushi which tastes so good. They are a bit pricey but if you're going to splurge on ayce sushi anyways, might as well go here."}
{"text":"If you want some not so Typical AYCE sushi then this is the place you want to be. The experience or taste of the food didn't blow me away but it's worth a try.... They should really consider renaming their restaurant though... When my friend told me we were going to KAKA... I thought it was a typo lol"}
{"text":"Lets just say I have a slight addiction to their torched salmon... Nothing crazy, just the fact that I go solely for that one dish. I guess that is a little crazy.  To start off, this place is always packed. I mean reserve one week in advance packed. The ambience is one that reminds me of a typical AYCE japanese restaurant however, a little smaller. It is casual however, the dim lights allow you to dress up a bit if you wanted to.  The food, in all honesty, I found to be a hit or miss. Recently, it has been getting a lot better however, there were times where the salmon sashimi was just not that fresh. The toarched salmon, and completely unrelated to my addiction, is amazing. The fish is tender and has a nice smokey taste.   A nice note would be that this place is expensive, as in almost 35ish on weekend dinners and they only offer lunch AYCE on weekends which is about 22ish. A good experience if you want to binge on some fish."}
{"text":"Tips: make reservation!!!   Torched sushi are so yummy! Good price, fast service, good food!   Btw many desserts were out of stock on the day I went. (Went there on a weekday at 5pm) But other desserts were really tasty, especially the cheese cake! Love it!"}
{"text":"We finally had a chance to try Kaka AYCE this week as they have been booked up with reservations and accept very few walk ins. We made a reservation 3 days in advance.  Their food ordering system is done on an iPad but the restaurant is still well staffed ensuring food is being brought to the table and empty plates are removed on a consistent basis. This was one thing this restaurant did very well compared to other AYCE.  The food selection was decent but smaller in comparison to most AYCE. What sets them apart is the actual items on the menu. This is one of the first places I've seen torched sushi (which is great by the way), octopus sushi, or red tuna sashimi. The fish is fresh and not slimy.  In most cases for AYCE restaurants, not everything is good and this applies for Kaka as well. I wasn't a big fan of some of their special rolls and the takoyaki had a strange texture inside.   This is one of the better AYCE restaurants in the Markham area. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"I came here with a couple of friends for their 'soft opening'! For this promotion, they unfortunately did not offer us AYCE options, only a la carte.   The service was spotty at best. Many of the items we ordered were incorrect or were designated for another table. They were however nice enough to comply when we indicated our issues and were served prompted after. The manager dropped by often at our table to check in and made sure our experience was to our taste.   As for their food quality, it is slightly above average to your average joe AYCE establishment. As it was a la care versus AYCE, the bill did come higher than we would have liked.   Overall, I would definitely come back when they offer their AYCE menu. This branch shows some promise for future success much like their sister location in Markham."}
{"text":"When we walked into the establishment it was already very lively, the setting was nice and I liked how most tables were booths which adds an element of privacy and hides how I embarrassingly inhale the sushi.  Oh by the way Google says it's closed on Sundays which it is obviously not so someone should look into that.  The price is on the higher side but I can see how that can be justified.  It is steps away from Eaton Centre, so prime real estate plus you do get higher end dishes that is not offered at the typical AYCE sushi place.  We had to try all the Tataki and unique torched sushi and the dishes ranged from good to very good.  You can tell when the dishes came that they cared about the detail that they put into them.  And because of this, even though they aren't that big size wise, there is alot of staff working.  The sushi bar alone had like 7 people preparing our dishes.  There may not be as many choices as other AYCE places, but they exchange quantity with quality.  Service was good and our food came within a reasonable time.  Reading the previous reviews I believe the combination of delayed service with higher pricing gave way for poor experiences but my recent experience says they've worked out their operations.  Other than the Tataki, the other highlight was the dessert, with much more choices (8-10) than other places including a green tea creme brule ends the evening just right."}
{"text":"I came in waited 45 mins to only sit down and see 5 tables empty. Why did I have to wait so long when there were so many empty tables? The food wasn't that great. Desserts weren't great. For the price, there are better sushi places in the area."}
{"text":"My whole experience changed after coming to eat at kaka this time. I've never sat down and been so upset/angry the whole time I was there. The staff except for the guy that sat us were all so rude. The food had totally downgraded. There are barely any options when choosing what to eat. The torched sushi isn't even that good and the sashimi is sliced up in huge chunks. They have completely changed the dessert menu and it taste terrible. Maximum seating time is 2 hours but I only stayed for 30 minutes. I had to ask for the bill three times. I'm seriously unimpressed. I don't recommend this place to anyone. Go somewhere else and get your bang for the buck elsewhere."}
{"text":"I know what you're thinking when you hear the name, \"Kaka All You Can Eat\", but no... you're wrong! Kaka All You Can Eat, more like AMAZING SUSHI ALL YOU CAN EAT! Kaka is my all time favourite all you can eat sushi place ever!   I'll start off and say that usually you have to make reservations beforehand, if you don't then you're usually waiting ~45 mins to an hour depending on when you go. Kaka is really nice inside, has that only traditional Asian look to it.   If you ever go to Kaka, definitely order the torched and compressed sushi! They're my absolute favourite! Has so much flavour and the fish is very fresh. I don't really have anything bad to say about Kaka as I've never had a bad experience before. All of their food tastes amazing (compared to other all you can eat sushi places). Also, another nice thing is that the portion sizes are quite small, which is good so you don't have to worry about over ordering or not being able to finish the dish.   Also, if you can, try to go on holidays like Valentines Day, Christmas, etc... they usually bring out a plate of 5 special sushi for that holiday! Sadly you can't re-order the special sushi from the menu ):   Anyways, if you're ever around Markham or you're crazy enough like me to make the trip up from wherever you are, I would totally recommend going to Kaka! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place has gone down so bad. From chicken karaage being Burnt and as big as a dime, sushi being tipped over and garnish on the plate for the torched one. Chicken wings being so tiny it makes me wonder why can they just serve the whole thing it was cut in half. From udon being bland and oily. New item poke being a joke. I cant call that a poke  We left after 35 mins of eating, just cant be there anymore.  Ive been to kaka 5 times and this would be the last. It has gone to great to good to satisfactory to bad."}
{"text":"By far the best AYCE I've encountered. This place delivered on every facet and if I could give it a 6 star rating it still would not suffice. The sashimi is fresh and generously portioned, the rolls were original and unique. The bomb, Godzilla and honey mustard rolls are all must tries. What really sets this place apart from the rest is the torched and pressed sushi options. I've never seen this offered at an AYCE and they were perfectly executed. The teppanyaki and appetizer selections were also exceedingly delicious. Lobster bisque, quail, pork belly and chicken heart skewers? I mean, come on, you might even forget there are sushi options. I can't give this place enough praise. Try to make resos if you want to avoid the wait though!"}
{"text":"I don't know where to begin praising this place. Nice decor, great service, amazing food,... We came here for on a Saturday for lunch. AYCE lunch on the weekends is 27.99, which I think is very good for the quality. Every dish was so tasteful and triggered different taste buds. They are fast and bring the food one by one so you won't get overwhelmed with the amount of food on your table. Beef sashimi and torched sushis where the highlight of our lunch. Deserts were also fantastic. They come in tiny portions so you can order a couple. I'm sure I gained 4 pounds after this meal YOLO"}
{"text":"Great sushi!"}
{"text":"Just went there for the first time based on reviews. And I must say it must have gone down a lot since it first opened. Rice was mushy. And some of the fish didn't taste fresh. I actually felt ill later that evening. The cooked food wasn't very good either. The menu was on the small side lacking options that many others have. It definitely was not value for money at all. I can't recommend this restaurant to anybody with good conscience."}
{"text":"So here's the thing: I first tried KaKa in Markham without hearing a single word about it and ended up thinking it was a pretty great place for ayce sushi. THEN, I read about how the Toronto location wasn't up to par with the Markham location which skewed me away from it for quite some time. After finally being able to get over that fact, I tried out this location and I am so glad I did.   While you must've already read about how unique and tasteful their sushi and special items are (and I wholeheartedly agree with those raving reviews), the Toronto location is better than the Markham location for a number of reasons:  - This location is bigger!! More space means more servers and more attention towards your table if you need anything.  - All dishes are unlimited. At the Markham location, the last row of food displayed on the iPad is limited at one dish order from that whole selection per person. At the toronto location, you can order as many of those special dishes as you like. They include the special rolls and tataki.  - The selection here is bigger. I remember the Markham location only having one type of tuna tataki whereas the Toronto location has about 6 different types, with one including truffle oil.  - This location serves up a special to-order dish that changes weekly. Ours was a delicious platter containing a variety of sushis and chirashi, including wagyu beef.   Overall, I highly recommend this location if you're craving AYCE sushi. I know I'll be back - I mean, it's been weeks since I've gone and I'm still craving their tataki and pressed sushi. (Minus one star because I wasn't a fan of their desserts - only liked the green tea ice cream which had a really strong matcha flavour and the panna cotta)."}
{"text":"A very very average restaurant. We came here for lunch and we ordered the bento boxes. Although their food is affordable and you get a lot of food for $10.99, their food was average at best. This location is definitely quantity over quality. If you are looking for value, this place suits your needs. If you are looking for quality, I would suggest driving a street over to Gal's. You can probably find a similar deal with better fish and food."}
{"text":"This place is outstanding!!!    Funky and the music is great.  Food served fast and hot and the desserts are extremely yummy.   Well worth the line time!   Totally recommend it."}
{"text":"Nothing like the one in markham. Service and selection is poor. Menus look like they were old used menus despite being a relatively new restaurant. The other kaka allows iPad ordering and definitely have a greater selection of food. Can take credit card (unlike other kaka) but no Amex"}
{"text":"If you are going here, MAKE A RESERVATION! They are very busy and you might not be able to get a table if you do not reserve in advance!   One of the best AYCE sushi out there for sure! The sushi had an authentic taste to it and different from many other sushi buffets. They had a large menu, probably one of the biggest I ever been to for AYCE sushi.   As for the atmosphere, the place was nicely decorated and had a nice ambiance. The service was very good as the waiters were very friendly!   I would definitely recommend Kaka Sushi to a friend. But, the only thing is this place is quite expensive compared to other places. For 2 people on a Saturday night was about 85$."}
{"text":"I was thoroughly disappointed with my dining experience at kaka that I went through the effort of making an account to leave a review.   Bottom line: even if the food quality is slightly better than other ayce places in the area it's not worth getting mistreated. Awful service.   I called weeks in advance to make a reservation. They kept us waiting past our reservation time, not a big deal but after the wait still squeezed our party of 5 into table for 4. Worst part was this table of 4 was empty the entire time we've been waiting - no apology.  After being seated was left unattended for 5-10 minutes. Nobody acknowledged us no tea, no menu/iPad, no cutlery sets. I attempted to get attention of servers on many occasions to no avail. I even resorted to raising my hand but got ignored.   My mom had to physically get up and flag a server down to get served. Still no apology. Safe to say dining experience was soured after that. Food was fine but not worth the poor service and experience. Safe to say will not be returning."}
{"text":"This is actually my second time visiting this restaurant and unfortunately I was quite disappointed. The first time I went, it was during the first week of when it opened and that visit was more enjoyable than the second.   I was not impressed with the food and the options that were given. Many other AYCE restaurants have better options and quality of the food. I observed that many people visiting the restaurant ordered a la carte, rather than AYCE.   Unfortunately I do not plan to come here again, but at least the servers were consistent."}
{"text":"Pretty standard sushi ayce. $32 dinner.   First time trying blowtorch sushi, and cant say I'm impressed. Not worth ayce for the price tbh.  However the desserts are pretty good. Mango lychee slush, vanilla creme brulee, pineapple and passion fruit yogurt are the winners for dessert.   Book reservations in advance, apparently it gets filled up quickly! Great service as well"}
{"text":"Please Dont delete my comment again????bad service especially the manager there.Everyone had serious diarrhea after dinning there.Me,my husband and my 1 year child ,my friend who is pregnant for 6 month,also her husband.We will never go there again! God!It was a nightmare for us."}
{"text":"We just tried KaKa All You Can Eat sushi for the first time and it won't be the last!  The sushi is very much above par of a regular AYCE on quality and they have different variations as well that are very tasty (like various blow torches sushi).   The chef is also a trained pastry chef so their desserts are quite unique as well.    The service was good but the manager Irene was the star.  She's passionate about KaKa and is very aware of the importance of good service and good food.    Tip: make a reservation or be prepared to wait a looong time!"}
{"text":"Came around 6pm and got seated immediately, no reservation needed. Though it did get much busier around 7pm. The best AYCE sushi I've ever had! Ordering is through an iPad, very simple and quick. There is actually a large variety of items you can order from appetizers, hand rolls, nigiri, sashimi, aburi, maki rolls, specialty rolls, and dessert! My favorite (and honestly best thing) on the menu is definitely the aburi sushi! Nicely torched, pressed, and yummy! I have to say that presentation still looked good for an AYCE place and even when it got busier. The quality surpassed what I thought a AYCE would be."}
{"text":"long wait???its been 40+ minutes! Not exaggerating... And as what they say in name: kaka ayce... But not for lunch... Even I request for dinner ayce, they dont do ayce for lunch time."}
{"text":"Very expensive, especially for weekend dinner, but worth it in my opinion.  The savoury food was fresh and delicious, arrived at a timely manner and the tastes were consistent in both my visits.   The desserts though...the desserts  dark chocolate custard, sake jelly panna cotta, and vanilla creme brûlée are my must-haves, if you like truffles then the one they offer is smooth, rich and very tasty.   A lot of people seem to have an issue with their service, so far it's been okay for me, all the servers were friendly and accommodating to my group of 8, which always adds to the dining experience.  So excited for kaka to arrive downtown (finally!), and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food is mediocre at its best. Service is super slow even though i came at 3pm. You wont get every item that you order. The specialty doesn't taste bad, but not amazing. Is it worth the price? I don't think so."}
{"text":"neat concept, i-pad ordering, eat until you drop, the beef dishes are great, fresh white tuna sashimi, and great dessert selection! price is decent as well, less than $300 for 10 people."}
{"text":"The best all.you can eat sushi I've been to, and I've been to a lot.   The service is the friendliest I've ever experienced, but even if they were assholes, I'd have to give 5 stars on quality alone.   I'm not gonna talk about the sashimi freshness and texture of the seaweed in the miso. Everything is great. Just go. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I called this restaurant at least 10 times and it never got through so I decided to walk in on a Monday night.  We arrived around 5:45pm and the front desk lady asked if I made reservation. I said I tried calling so many times but out of luck. She said well that just means everyone was trying to call etc. I was going to say this is not a call centre, I don't need an operator to tell me the next available representative would be available shortly. Yes, that's what you get when you call them! You have a whole team picking up calls? Lol  After her excuses, she said there were only 2 seats at the bar because people made reservation 3 weeks in advance. 2 secs later she asked if I wanted the seats or else she would give it to the couple behind me. I was quite pissed at her attitude but I said yes.   Honestly, food came quick and they were pretty good. Warning: When you order one asparagus, you really get ONE and not a small dish.  We noticed lots of people were waiting at the door while lots of tables were empty for 1-1.5 hrs! Obviously they were saving the tables for those who made reservation! So what if people didn't show up? No wonder there's always a huge lineup.   After an hour, we were asked to order desserts and they gave us the bill. Where does it say one hour limit? They pissed me off again. Will I come back? Probably not."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  Came here with my family for dinner recently.  There was 8 of us so the only time available was either 5pm or 9pm.  Luckily my parents like to eat early so the 5pm reservation worked perfectly for us.  If you have a big group, be sure to make reservations as the restaurant is not very big.  Pros & Cons:  Pros: - nice interior and comfortable seatings - service was quick and very helpful - IPad ordering makes it fun and easy to order - includes aburi-style (torched) sushi & pressed sushi which are fancier sushi that I have not seen at an AYCE place and these were delicious especially aburi salmon sushi - a few other dishes that I don't see often at a AYCE - lamb skewers, grilled shrimp on skewer, cauliflower soup, variety of desserts - creme brûlée & mango slush  Cons: - it's a bit pricey for people like my sister who eat mostly cooked food - about $32 - it's a bit pricey for seniors like my parents who eat very little and the price is only $2 less - sashimi was okay, nothing special - my niece had the ramen and she said the soup was bland - it appears that the menu is not always the same, some Yelp reviewers posted lobster bisque, pork belly skewers, grilled quail which I was looking forward to trying but it was not on the menu or it displayed that it was not available  Overall, we enjoyed it and will likely be back."}
{"text":"Came in with high expectations - the place was rated 4 stars, which is as high as Mi Ne. Unfortunately,  the quality is nowhere near the level of Mi Ne despite the cost being the same. Sushi was dull and bland, with the exception of honey mustard roll and torched salmon sushi. The appetizers were ok, and the deserts were good - but both of those could be had for a lot less in just about any ayce restaurant. The service was ok almost until the end, when the waitress quickly opened the stack of bills I left and asked me if I am aware that tip is not included. I left 10%, which is of course under the customary 15% but I felt that paying more than $80 for two people and getting such poor quality of food was unacceptable. Won't go to this place again.     Tldr: a la a cart price for ayce quality sushi - do not recommend."}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 4/5 This place is located at the First Markham Place plaza on Hwy 7 and Rodick Rd.    [SERVICE] - 4/5 Service was good. Our orders were all correct, but the servers didn't really interact with us to create a more personable experience.   [DÉCOR] - 5/5  Very comfortable, romantic, and a great place for lunch & dinner.   [QUALITY] - 4/5 Pretty high quality for an AYCE sushi place. Sashimi was fresh, and their torched sashimi was unique and added a nice smoky flavour to your choice of sashimi.    [ORDER] - 4/5 All-You-Can-Eat Weekend Dinner - $33.99: a little pricey but worth the price because this is one of the highest quality AYCE spots in Markham. My favourite items were the torched sushis. Each one tasted fresh and very flavourful.   [OVERALL] - 4/5 I would definitely recommend this place because this is one of the best spots for a more high-end AYCE sushi experience in Markham!"}
{"text":"5 stars: Second time here, this time with reservations on a Friday night. Finding parking is a challenge at 7pm but got seated promptly when we arrived.  Annie was our server and she was great, attentive for a packed house on Friday night, food came at reasonable time and tea thermos stayed topped off, the tablet ordering system is very efficient and even marks the time the order was sent to the kitchen.  After having the torched sushi I could not go back to eating the regular sushi rolls! The spicy white tuna roll tasted dry somehow and we couldn't finish some pieces. The fish was very tender and sauce was very flavorful, it felt delicate to eat. The torched beef had a unique flavor from the flame, almost like a kiss of BBQ, our table kept ordering more. The pressed sushi had a nice unique sauce but it's just pressed into a solid brick of sushi. The house even sent a complimentary dish, deep fried oyster, scallop sashimi, in tapioca with a ponzu sauce. Somehow found room to down the desserts, the mango slush is tasty with real fruit, creamy green tea brûlée which I wish could eat a few more, but now I'm waddling around super full but extremely happy I tried his place. Would visit again, it seems they fixed the service issue from previous reviews.   4 stars: The early bird Yelp dinner  - MUST make a reservation can't show up, if they tell you that over the phone that person is wrong! Cuz it happened to us  - portions of rice bigger than normal dinner experience - menu was smaller only 3 torched items, standard sashimi but quality was off - only 6 tables that night but some plates didn't arrive, we got the last call for early bird at 5:30pm and got the bill then here arrived the seaweed shrimp skewer(delish but we're stuffed and leaving)  - waitresses were all friendly and even let my toddler take an ice cream to go"}
{"text":"Still a solid 4 stars from me.   Kaka is really busy these days, so only managed to get a 9 PM reservation time and there were still others waiting after me to get a table. I was not really surprised given their current success (new downtown location opening soon too).   They have a really vast AYCE menu with Thai items, fish tacos, a wide array of different sushi types, soups, and desserts. My favourite items are the torched sushi and pressed salmon sushi - unbelievably good and you can't get torched at all other AYCE places so definitely a unique selling point. The food is very filling. I felt really stuffed after.   The green tea creme brûlée is also really good for dessert. The ambience is great - I like the design of the restaurant (It feels very warm). The service is also fast, efficient, and relatively courteous (though they do try and cap the time at 1.5 hrs quite rigorously). Nonetheless, still nice service.   At around $40 after tax and tip though, it's probably a once in a while type of place for me."}
{"text":"Wanted to make reservations so I called in today but nobody bothered to pick up. I was put on hold for over 15 minutes so I just hung up. Very disappointed.  I came here once during the summer and really enjoyed the food but they really need to improve their customer service.  I'm not sure if the line was just busy or something but having to wait so long just to call in for reservations is just ridiculous.   I'm so sad now ;-;   UPDATE!  So half an hour after I posted this, KaKa messaged me and apologized and the manager personally helped me make my reservations!  When I arrived the manager personally came to the restaurant to apologize even though it was her day off!   Irene is super sincere and she explained that there are hundreds of calls everyday and that they try their best to accommodate. I really appreciate her coming on her day off just to make sure all her customers are happy. She takes her customers very seriously so I truly appreciate it!"}
{"text":"Little expensive but it is completely compensated by the quality of the food. Quite fresh and delicious. The food comes really fast and the service is quite friendly and attentive. I strongly recommend this place if you're looking for an all you can eat place. Best quality sushi ever."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try this place for a long time, but they were always booked up.  So we ended up just sitting at the sushi bar.    Service was OK.  It's a busy place, but they don't always notice you.   Ordering from the iPad used to be a novelty, but it's almost expected now.  The iPad we had was sort of sliding out of its housing, but didn't interfere with the functionality too much.  Overall the food was good.  You would receive specialty dinner items, that were not on the menu.  Most of these were the higher-end fishes and they were nicely plated and flavor was good.  Price is a little higher than most AYCE, but the quality is definitely there.    I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Round 2 of KaKa.  Spoiler: it could've been better.   KaKa is one of the \"finer\" ayce sushi places in Markham. I say finer very loosely.  The restaurant is small but clean. The decor doesn't WOW me but it doesn't look like a food court either.  Let's just say they do enforce the 2 hour limit as there are people waiting in line.   Everything was mediocre. Very mediocre.  There was this fish (idk it in English) but when we clicked to order it was \"out of stock\". It was a little disappointing just because we came for my Aunt's birthday and she was really looking forward to that dish.   The skewers were okay but not super dazzling (try the one on pmalls second floor foodie court if you're craving skewers! & avoid the restaurant next to Coco on highway 7 & Kennedy).   The udon was actually pretty good this time. It tasted right and the noodles were nice and soft without being soggy.    They haven't updated their sashimi menu yet, even on weekends they serve you the basics of salmon, tuna ... and not the scallops or shrimp, or squid that other surrounding sushi restaurants are offering.    The rolls were okay as they were fresh and still crispy but I could buy the same from a sushi foodcourt store.  The dessert have gone downhill besides the creme brulee (which was A-OK).  The mango slush was really powdery ): and left a residue in my mouth.  The icecream ... was just icecream.  The lychee little pudding was soo sour - holy shit.  Overall, it's a good place to come for a celebration but not something I'd be into every week, especially with the limited sashimi selection."}
{"text":"Expensive, sure, but quality and service are nothing to scoff at here. A super solid 4 stars and a place I will be returning to in the very near future. This is the second time I've visited and it was just as good as I remembered.  My friends and I booked a table for 10 on a Monday night. Unfortunately for us, there was a snowstorm happening during that day. As a result, half our party showed up an hour late, yet the Kaka waitstaff were more than understanding and at no point made us feel anxious. Instead, they reassured us that it was fine and that they understood because of the weather.   Additionally, the service we experienced is one of the best, if not THE best, at an AYCE sushi restaurant. Food arrived really quickly as soon as we placed an order and it was all hot and fresh. I was starving at this point since it was 7:30 PM and our tables were immediately flooded with plates of delicious food.  First off, everything we ate at our table was above average in quality. The food comes in small quantities so you can sample anything you want from the menu.   Appetizers & Sashimi (1 piece per order) Specialty Rolls (2 pieces per order) Rolls (3 pieces per order)  From the sashimi to the kalbi to the soup, there was no item that stood out to me as particularly mediocre. Here's a list and short description of outstanding items:    Sashimi (in general): Fresh and plentiful. Kalbi: No fatty pieces here, just high-quality short beef ribs, highly recommend! Seaweed Shrimp: Yummy twist on shrimp tempura; battered in a seaweed mixture and coated with a mild wasabi mayo Spring Eggs: No other AYCE restaurant has this specialty item, everybody ordered at least one of these! Torched & Pressed Sushi: Personally, my favourite is the pressed tiger shrimp sushi - I love that hint of smokiness that accompanies the entire bite. I also really enjoyed the seasoning of the sushi rice for each piece. Beef Tongue Skewer: Very tender with great seasoning! Highly recommend if you enjoy eating beef tongue Baked Cheese Mussels: One friend ordered 6 platters of 6 pieces for himself, if that's saying anything.  Desserts: Honestly my favourite thing about Kaka. The mango lychee slush (mostly mango) uses real mango (or at least it sure tastes like it due to the slight acidity that comes from real mango slush). Green tea creme brulee is a must try, they don't skimp on the green tea. The dark chocolate cup was very decadent (in a good way) and not overpoweringly sweet. If you like pineapple, you'll also enjoy the pineapple lychee yogurt (can't really taste the lychee in this one). If you like lychee and/or panna cotta, try the lychee panna cotta! Also really good haha.   Overall, everyone had a good time, great food, and the service was amazing. Price is on the hefty side ($37 after tax and tip), so that's the only reason it's not a full 5 stars from me. I would still come back in a heartbeat though if my friends asked to go back."}
{"text":"My all time favourite AYCE! It is pricier than most AYCE but its definitely worth it. I recommend this place to all of my friends and they absolutely love it.   We came on a Monday night so it wasn't too busy. Service was fast and exceptional! However I wished they bought out all the sashimi we ordered at once ... We ordered 100 pcs of salmon sashimi and a bunch of other ones but in the end we decided to just not get the rest of the sashimi as we were stuffed and sick of the salmon sashimi which ruined our appetite for any other sashimi.  Other than that everything else was just perfect! Especially the torched and seared sushi! My favourite.   Will definitely be returning!!"}
{"text":"Kaka is pretty good for all you can eat. They have some pretty awesome desserts (creme brulee, etc. And their mango slush works well as a drink during the feast), their torched sushi (the main attraction) is quite delicious and has interesting flavours, and the cooked food is fairly good too. You can't expect their torched sushi to be as delicious as, for example, Jabistro's because Kaka IS an ayce restaurant. So again, it's pretty good for ayce.   There isn't much service since you're gonna be ordering from an iPad so the servers are really only there to give you your dishes and clear your table.   What I don't like is that they seem to always have dishes that are unavailable. In fact a lot of them are unavailable or I've never had a chance to try it because it's never been available! Take it off the menu or make more for your customers to try!   In general, kaka is prob my go to ayce restaurant (of course, if I manage to get a table) because it is pretty good...for all you can eat! On the weekends I'd probably head over to tenichi because they have sweet shrimp and scallop sashimi + other special dishes for around the same weekend price."}
{"text":"Go KAKA for AYCE!   Happened to see pictures of the opening on @markhamfood and made a reservation for the place as soon as I could. I went there opening night with 8 other guests and they were very accommodating. We arrived 20 minutes early but they were ready to serve us.   We ordered round upon round upon round of food. They arrived in a variety of dishes, all presented very nicely. All the food tasted very fresh and did not seem frozen. I'm going to blitz the food because there was so much: - edamame: standard yum - meat skewers: fantastic, best I've had at ayce. They actually spice the meat and they're pretty big chunks - tempura: nice and crispy with light breading; definitely above average  - hand rolls: generous portions of the filling and prepared well - sushi rolls: pretty standard sushi, but their speciality ones are where they stand out  - specialty sushi: LAWD gimme more! Great sushi and the owner was SUPER nice and gave us some that were off menu (thank you!) Probably because it was the first day  - sashimi: nice thick marbled cuts that did not taste frozen  - desserts: what a selection. The berry crumble and the mango slush (?) Were the best.   The service is great and was very understanding despite our bottomless stomachs. Cannot speak enough about the service!   TOP NOTCH AYCE SUSHI. If you're craving sushi, this is a must visit!   Foot note 1: pop costs $2.50/can. Do not order it unless you're craving it. I ordered it not knowing.  Foot note 2: washroom has one urinal and one toilet. There could be a wait.  Foot note 3: I think I ate too much, but there was a distinct taste that I got tired of. Keep in mind this was after maybe the 5th round?"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised at how worth it this was.   I went for the AYCE on a weekday ($28.99). I showed up early by 30 minutes and actually didn't have to wait at all! We ordered a whole bunch of food (18 orders) and expected a 10-20 minute wait because of previous AYCE experience. However, all the food came within 5 minutes. All the orders came except for one (but they quickly brought it over. The waitress actually ran back to us panting so that was cute) and overall had a good experience. They tend to rotate often, so you don't have to wait long before they confirm your order (2-3 minutes)   Food: The sashimi fresh and good. It was also cold, so that was a good sign (sometimes sushi are lukewarm-cold). The tempura was fresh, and pretty much everything else. The mango slush desert was really good as well. I ordered it and drank it like a smoothie. Octopus was good as well, same as the meat dishes (besides the karage. It was kind of dry and sad). The tofu was actually bomb so bless, and my friends said that the miso soup was good as well.  The rolls were kind of weird because I've never tried these before (like the bomb roll, las vegas roll, crazy monkey, etc.), but it was fine. The green dragon roll was like 80% avocado so lots of love to them for that. The creme brulee vanilla kind of tasted like playdoh but I liked the creme brulee green tea a lot more. Also, their ice cream servings were bigger than most places :)   Price: Is normal, but better than other places at this price actually. Also, a nice thing they do is that they don't charge for service fees in the receipt before/after tax! Everything is very transparent and they don't even force any amount of tip (I paid by cash, unsure about machine).   Just a note, this place needs a reservation or else you'll wait a long time. Their reservation service is pretty neat because they texted me later that day to confirm. I realized I couldn't make that time and texted them back to change it to an hour later and they replied briefly saying that they could do it :)"}
{"text":"A bit expensive but it's one of the best, if not the best all you can eat sushi restaurants in the GTA. Their sushi is great but their other items are sort of so-so. They bring you a sample platter with their specialty sushi at the start and explained each one of them to us, it was a great touch and they were all delicious! The service is great and the food comes ridiculously fast when you send your order into the kitchen via the provided ipad."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner as my wife heard it was good. She made reservation a week ahead. We actually had to wait 10 minutes to be seated.   Let's first talk about the bad side. Our table was facing a black wall. When we sat down, I noticed the wall and the lights hanging from the ceiling was extremely dusty. Take a look at the picture I've taken. If you can sit at another table.  On to the good side. The service from our waitress was very good. All of them were great. When got our orders very quick. I loved the torched sushi but that was it. Not really impressed with their menu. For $32.99 I'd expect to get more items such as more grilled vegetables and sashimi. I'm disappointed that this place doesn't have scallop nor octopus sashimi. In retrospect, good service but average food. Cleanliness is also an issue at this place."}
{"text":"Came here for all you can eat lunch, even at later time around 2pm. Barely any tables occupied but all our orders took extremely long time and everything came out staggered, likely on purpose. For example if we ordered 5 tempura, they will give 2, then 1, and then 2 all more than 10 min apart. Basically it took us more than an hour just go get the very initial order much less the orders we put in after. The staggered food arrivals were for almost every single items which makes us believe they are doing it on purpose to make us eat less. We were party of 5, 3 guys and 2 girls and none of us obese or big. Will never come back here and will warn everybody to stay away."}
{"text":"First ever review, I normally don't write reviews, but this really pisses me off. Kaka sushi was GREAT the first time I went, which was about 4-5 month ago. They had a good selection of food and everything was good.   HOWEVER this time I went it was a holiday, they started by putting me on the normal dinner instead of weekend dinner menu. Midway through they realized the mistake and fixed it. Even after they fixed it, most of the more expensive selections such as sweet shrimp and quail were missing! They said they never had it on the menu! Yet the first time I went they had it. Big thumbs down!"}
{"text":"Overall, just doesn't worth it for the price u paid, weekday after tax is $35, weekend $38.5, not many selection, every section only have 4-6 items to choose from(app, grill, noodle, sashimi, sushi, dessert), the service is ok, food come out pretty quick compare to other AYCE places,"}
{"text":"First time there,  dinner on a wednesday night , booking at 7pm.  ( already full house and no walk in). Very good service,  food are high quality,  but less choice compare with other jap all you can eat.  Everything are so fresh.   Also the tourched sushi is a MUST try!!!  I love it.  Each table get a tablet for you to order food,  so we dont have to wait for servers to come over and place your order .  Food also come very fast."}
{"text":"Standard fare all-you-can-eat sushi buffet. All the raves I've been hearing about this place were a little overrated. The quality and variety of the food wasn't bad but it didn't live up to its price tag (a little more expensive than most ayce sushi buffets).  I did enjoy the implementation of ipads for ordering food, There were a few items that were missed but it wasn't much of an issue. Their torched sushi was quite good. I didn't try the pressed sushi even though that seems to be one of their unique items. I heard it was just very dense and compressed sushi (hence the name) and that it wasn't really that great. I was also recommended to try a steamed egg pudding in the sweet and salty broth? It was interesting but not my cup of tea.   I was very excited to try their desserts but found that most of the things I wanted to try were unavailable. I'm guessing it is only offered on weekend evenings?  Doesn't hurt to at least try this place out in case you do like some of the specialty items that aren't offered anywhere else."}
{"text":"I booked a table for 4, three weeks in advance and on the day of I called to add another person, so table of 5. They we're quick to accommodate and we didn't mind squeezing in to make it work, and it did work and my group had a wonderful time!  It was all our first time and we heard amazing things about it, even though we expect to be your typical AYCE, but boy were we wrong.   We love ordering from the iPad and most of the items came by the pieces, although Kaka did miss some items that we ordered, but by the end we're glad those items never came.  Amongst the five of us, we ordered a lot of food including: shrimp tempuras, beef ribs, or tongue skewers, chick me heart skewers, scallop tempuras, few hand rolls, sashimi, a good bunch of rolls, wakame salad, miso soup, lobster bisque, garlic shrimps, torched sushi, pressed sushi, mango lychee slush, Hokkaido milk tea crime brûlée, green tea ice creams and two types of chocolate ganaches.  The few items that must be called out are:  Lobster bisque - blew everyone's mind because it tasted legit and you really get the lobster and shellfish flavor. It's really nice and creamy.  Torched sushi - I could go there and just eat this, it was great portion of fish to rice and the seared taste was just perfect! The condiments that came with each type of seafood or meat are paired well, like Yuzu with the torched salmon. The scallops were big and buttery.  Pressed sushi - the salmon option was nicely flavored and a few of us at the table were obsessed with them.  Mango lychee slush - great option to cleanse your palate as one of my friend mentioned, and it really was refreshing and great if you love mango and lychee.  The service we had last night on a Friday was great and the ambiance was great and the food was epic as one of my friends put it. We will definitely be back!  Ps: it was great that the staff are on top of taking empty plates to make room for more food!"}
{"text":"Event: Saturday Dinner Date Night  Wait Period: 3 hours  - we left to get a haircut and came back. Only had to wait 1 hour :)!  Service: Good  One day I saw an article on blogTO and the pictures looked soooo enticing. I'm not a big fan of sushi (more of a maki fan), but it looked SO delicious, we had to try it.  It was packed on a Saturday night. Did I mention that when I called in to book a reservation, they refused to take it and said that I had to walk in to get a number (first come first serve)? So do this - go in, get a number, leave your contact info & if you live close by..just go home first :)  Food: Let's just skip the boring cooked food, dessert, fried rice etc. Because we all know it doesn't matter. You don't go to Kaka for that. Now, the blow torched sushi. Being one of the only few places that has blow torched sushi, I guess you can say it's unique. My sushi was blow torched, OMG. Did it taste as good as it looked though? No. There was definitely variety in their menu, but no variety in taste. All the sushi tasted the same - a chunk of rice and the spice they used in all their sushi. Bf & I were suuuper disappointed, as we waited a month to try this place. Sadface :( .. There was not enough \"fire\" in the sushi. It's like eating charcoal  grilled steak without the charcoal grilled taste or smoked meat without the smokey taste. If only they blow torched it slightly longer - it would have made a difference in the taste. Where can you find this taste in sushi you ask? Mizuki Sushi's blow torched Mizuki roll.   Price: $28.99 per person for a weekend dinner. Total came up to about $72 for both of us, tips + tax.   I don't know if I'll recommend this place to anyone, but I won't be returning. Definitely not worth waiting 2 or 3 hours for. This is one of those once in a lifetime places. It's new, it's different, I've tried it. That's about it."}
{"text":"This place is not worth the price or the 40 minute wait to reserve a table over the phone or the deposit that I had to make to reserve the table because my party had more had 10 people. The service is bad and when you order food you have to constantly remind them of it if it's an expensive item. They will also not give you the amount you ordered, hoping you forget or don't want to bother reminding them a fourth time. I don't know why people are raving about this place their food quality is exactly the same as every other sushi buffet. By the price is more expensive and getting a table is close to impossible because their staff don't like answering the phone during their reservation hours."}
{"text":"Trying to make a reservation? They tell you it's full? Guess what? ... Come just before they open on a Saturday and I bet you'll have plenty of tables for your choosing!  Aburi style sushi looks good in pictures. But, still million miles from the JaBristo. If that's what you are going for ... I say save your money and hit up JaBristo or VanCity :) to be fair, the hot food are pretty good and with a fair bit of options too!  Remember to order lots during your 1st order. Later orders might get a bit slower ;)   Highlight of the visit:  Ordering on the iPad and the delivery of the food! It's also one of the cleanest AYCE I've been.  Food (Taste): 5/5 Food (Presentation): 4/5 Kitchen (Delivery Speed): 5/5 Service: 2.5/5 Ambiance: 5/5 Fun Factor: 4/5"}
{"text":"Made reservation here a week in advance, which is short notice for Kaka.  6 people for 7 pm On a Sunday night. They do not take in half hr's (i.e. 6:30, 7:30 etc) Prices were $33 adults $31 seniors $16 kids 9 and up, kids under 3 were free They will send you a text message the day before to remind you of your reservation, which i thought was a nice touch. Compared to all the other AYCE places now a days Kaka will not disappoint. I really hope their quality stays. The waitress were polite and seated us right away.  you order on an ipad food came quick, hot food were hot ! the salmon sashimi were fresh  my favorite would be their dragon roll Dessert: was good, too bad their jasmine creme brulee sold out really wanted to try that. I had their regular vanilla and green tea creme brulee which were good too. I could not get enough of their Mango Lychee slush! Must try  one item i would said is lacking was their shrimp tempura. It tasted really powdery.  Brother in law made reservations after enjoying this place :)"}
{"text":"Kaka is a titan amongst the AYCE sushi joints of GTA, and part of this is due to its aburi/torched offerings. The menu isn't particularly large but there is a decent variety. The place is very clean and well kept, and customers order off an iPad menu system. Food comes relatively quickly, and very well portion controlled (a win-win for customers in terms of limiting waste and overeating; as other places will serve a full six pieces rather than a half roll of three). From aburi nigiri, to gyutan, there is something to please any customer on this menu, which sees seasonal changes and promotional/limited time offerings. Best of all, it won't bleed your wallet. Definitely coming back when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Honestly love it here.  The blow torch and compressed sushi is the bomb!!! Didn't expect much coming here because it's AYCE and the quality at AYCE restaurants are never that great.  But this is my favourite AYCE sushi restaurant!  The quality and the flavour blew me away.  I enjoyed everything from here and I did not have one bad experience.  The service was fairly quick.  It's also really elegant looking inside which is perfect for those first dates.  Wish this place wasn't too far, otherwise I'd be here every week."}
{"text":"All you can eat Japanese place with unique items - making it a must try!  Location/decor: -The restaurant is located inside the First Markham Place complex where it is beside Ding Tai Fung -Inside, it is a very new and stylish looking place with comfy seats. It is not the biggest restaurant but a medium sized spot. For group more than 6-8, it will be a bit tricky for seating -The place is super busy but service is still great. But if you are looking at reservations, they are taking them about 1 week ahead of time. Walk-in seating is very rare and only works with 4 at most. We went at 5PM thinking it would be free but the place was packed where people were eating at 430PM!  Food: -All the ordering is done via a iPad where you can scroll through menu items and submit the order for delivery to your table. There are \"special\" items which are fancier dishes like duck confit, snow crab soup, fish tacos and etc which are done via paper and limited to 2 orders per diner. -It has all you usual regular sashimi, sushi, tempura, terayaki and etc which all tasted good -The highlight (and I think the the main reason) is come to try the torched and box sushi - they are super good and unique from all other places that I have tried. We ended up doing 2 orders of the torched stuff because it was so good. -The other highlight was the \"special\" items that rotate based on diner feedback - we loved the fish tacos, buttermilk fried chicken and duck confit salad. -For desserts, there is the usual green tea ice cream and etc but I would highly recommend the mango slush - we had 3 each :). Sweet refreshing end to the meal.  Overall, Kuka is a great all you can eat place where their \"Special\" items, torched and boxed sushi make it stand out. The down side is that there is long reservation wait and the price is a bit higher compared to others but I think it is balanced by their food items. Definitely will return with others!"}
{"text":"Mandatory 15% service charge which there was barely any service... food is soso with weird sauce.."}
{"text":"We decided to give Kaka another chance to redeem itself after our initial visit from last summer.  I went with my wife and we got the 5pm reservation time slot on a Saturday.   When we arrived, we got seated immediately which was totally different from what I recall (we waited around 40 min despite having reservations).   We were greeted nicely from our waitress who was great throughout the entire night.   She was very attentive and helpful. Another thing we noticed was that they changed up the cups!  Last time we went, they had these black cups which left marks when you wipe with napkins.   This time, it was white cups and they were pretty clean.   While we were ordering, the waitress  came out of nowhere and presented us a complimentary plate with some special items (pictures attached) They tasted amazing! Too bad you cannot order as part of the ayce experience.   Then they had a special menu where you can order twice from it, with 2 items only per person. We tried as many as we could  but nothing on the menu really stood out.     Overall, the experience was great! But don't expect to be blown out of the water in terms of quality when it comes to the food.  It's pretty on par with most ayce restaurants and have pretty much the same items.  We would most likely return though sometime in the future."}
{"text":"I take a 3 weeks for the reservation but so disappointed for this all you can eat buffet.  The service is fine, but the food quality is lower than my recommend,  If you pay about $28 to get this kind of food quality, it is so worst.  The fish is the lower quality kind, and the sushi is warm (the fish), unbelievable!  The lobster soup is cold and not too much items for you choice.  But the service is so far so good.  The table is too close and the chair is not balance, not feel comfortable.  I will not go again because if you pay that price, so many choice you can choose.  And don't trust the picture for they post because all is totally difference."}
{"text":"I ate here with my family during the holidays and I had a great time! We didn't have a reservation but the host did their best to get us a seat as quickly as possible.  I enjoyed the menu selection and was very impressed with the torched sushi which is something you don't necessarily see in your typical all you can eat sushi restaurant. Other unique items on the menu included the japanese egg and special sushi rolls. Despite the unique menu I found that thier sashimi selection was fairly limited.   In addition to the food I found that we were given excellent service! Our food came very quickly and our servers were nice and always made sure that any empty dishes were taken away ensuring our table was clear and ready for more food!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Markham location a couple times and loved it so I thought I would give the downtown location a try and it will be the first and last time I visit.  Walking in, I was greeted by two ladies at the hostess stand and was told it'd be approximately a 40 minute wait for two people. It was a Saturday at 6:00 PM ish so I had expected that. The other people who were also waiting kept following up with the hostess' and kept being promised that they would be seated soon. But one of the ladies didn't seem to know what she was doing and seemed very confused. She would go up to people and call them by the wrong name and got super confused when they informed her that she had the wrong person. She would then shrug then seat whoever she approached. Maybe it was her first time working? The manager seemed very busy yelling at this one waitress named Joanna (she was yelling loud enough that I could hear her from the waiting area) and I could hear her warn her at the bar that \"she would fire people if necessary!\" Super unprofessional in my opinion.   I followed up once and gave them my name and was promised that we were up next. Shortly after the hostess came up to me and asked me if I was Juliana (even though I had literally just told her my name). I told her no, she got super confused, left to talk to the manager, and then came back and took me to my seat.   Once we were seated, it took 10 minutes before a server came up to us to take our orders. I guess it was because they were too busy socializing with each other to do their jobs properly. They gave us a broken menu. She used a tiny little piece of paper to write our order and some of our stuff didn't come out so we have to follow up multiple times.   The food was pretty decent but took forever to get. The beef tataki and the salmon aburi sushi were yummy. My friend also really liked the beef tacos. Unfortunately some of the items were unavailable. We asked the waitress several times what some of the items were and she told us she didn't know what they were. We also asked her what she recommended and she couldn't give us an answer. Super reassuring!   Save your $35 and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Don't try this restaurant. I waited for more 20 minutes , they will not give you sit based on the time that you came. They reserve everything for their \"friend\".And you will keep on waiting. Even when you came earlier , you won't get the seat. Do not go to a restaurant that do not respect to customer."}
{"text":"My new favourite AYCE restaurant. This place has been fully booked since they've opened. I came a couple times and even though it has been so busy they still kept up with their service and quality.   This place is different from other AYCE places because of they offer blowtorch sushi and pressed sushi, which are delicious. Some other items that stood out to me were the tako wasabi sushi, yam tempura (very thinly sliced and lightly battered), grilled vegetables -not many AYCE places offer vegetables that isn't just bean sprouts. For desserts, I really liked the matcha cream brûlée. I didn't expect too much, but wow. It blew me away. It was very rich in matcha flavour and had a really smooth creamy texture. They also offer ice cream now. There are many other items that stood out and are unique to this restaurant. The food is really fresh as well.   They offer really good service. Very courteous and friendly. They quality check to make sure everything is perfect at the table. They accommodate their guests really well. They use iPads for ordering which is really convenient, and saves a lot of time. The food is served out quickly, so quick we couldn't even eat fast enough to clear the table for more space. I never had any missed orders here, which is rare with other AYCE places.    Overall, best AYCE sushi restaurant in Markham. A must try. Make your reservations ahead of time.   Minus 1 star because their sushi comes with way too much rice."}
{"text":"What I got: Dinner AYCE sushi($34.99)  Pros: - There is a promotion happening at the downtown location where they are offering a free bluefin tuna set for anyone who does the AYCE menu. This item isn't on the menu yet and I think is better than some of the items on the menu.  - It is a pricier sushi place but comes with more unique items- for example: tataki, duck, earl gray creme brûlée.  - Salmon sashimi was very fresh, any of the sashimi items are recommended except the \"premium kani\" which was just imitation crab.  - The teppanyaki beef was also pretty good, very soft and not too chewy.  - Also includes vegetarian selection on the menu.   Cons - Dinner only has AYCE menu, lunch has both a la carte and AYCE.  - Make sure you keep track of your items, some rolls we ordered never arrived and we had to re-order.  - Wouldn't recommend the fish tacos, there wasn't a lot of fish, mostly lettuce.  - They do not take Amex credit card here, only Visa and MC."}
{"text":"Came here over the Christmas holidays for AYCE dinner. When I made the reservations, I did tell them that there would be 3 babies at the dinner and that we would need high chairs. However when we arrived, they presented us with a circle booth. While this would have been beautiful when we didn't have kids, unfortunately we would need a more functional space. So it took them another 10-15 mins to figure out where to seat us. It wasn't a great start but the service and food made up for the hiccup.  The food however was great! We ordered using a tablet and the sever went into detail the serving portions and how to submit. The sushi was fresh and the \"torched\" offerings were unique and delicious! They also presented us with special amuse bouche which was a very nice touch.  They took care with the presentation of the food and treated each plate as if it were fine dining. I recommend the lamb skewers, torched sushi, ramen was good, sashimi fresh, Creme brûlée for dessert was delicious also! Honestly, the whole menu was good. Come with a good appetite, you'll want to try everything in the menu! Definitely the best AYCE restaurant I have been to!   Beware they watch your time limit!"}
{"text":"This is my absolute fav ayce sushi place around Toronto! It's always busy so make sure to make a reservation. But the food is fresh and it comes out fast. Staffs are also really quick at helping you. They have a huge menu you can get sushi m, sashimi m, udon, fried rice, appetizers, chicken wings and dessert here. If you like sushi you gotta visit!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, I am in love with this place. It's not the regular sushi that I care about, but the addicting torched and pressed sushi. Torched sushi is quite self explanatory - the fish atop a bed of rice is light torched/seared. he pressed sushi, however, consists of 2 layers each of rice, fish and sauce, pressed and cut into bite size pieces. I usually need quite some time between AYCE sushi sessions, but I will crave Kaka's sushi the next day. Then there's dessert, consisting of the regular ice cream offerings, along with chocolate cream pots, mango slushes and crazy good creme brulee. *drool*"}
{"text":"The first time I came here, the service was ok and the food was good, but the last 2 times I've been here, service has been extremely slow and the food quality just hasn't been the same. Food doesn't come out when you order it (i.e. ordered one dish of karaage when we sat down that didn't come out until we were about to leave an hour and a half later).  + They always run out of creme brûlée. Also, $30.99 lunch on holidays (which I wouldn't be upset about if they actually had all their desserts available). Not coming back"}
{"text":"Price: Over priced.   Food: Sushi to rice ratio is horrible. Too much rice. Cold kitchen dishes e.g tako yaki and tempura items were cold.  Overall: Had high expectations but everything had issues.  Ipad menu sucks, must confirm the order with a waiter."}
{"text":"Ah, after months of hearing rave reviews about this place (and admittedly, some less than rave) I came here with 3 other people to eat an early dinner. The end result? Eh, I've had better, for cheaper.   Regarding the food, I've had better sushi downtown at Fushimi. The rolls weren't anything special and even the torch sushi did not have that signature charred flavour. There were some unique rolls but the quality did not astound me (especially if you consider its ~$40+ per person after tax and tip). The sashimi was good and decently portioned. The fish to rice ratio for the nigiri was good too. The dessert was probably the best party (sugar, can't go wrong there) and they offer some interesting choices such as vanilla or green tea creme brulee.   Some aspects of the service needs work. I asked for ginger 3 times (5-10 minutes apart) and finally my Chinese friend had to ask in Chinese for it a bit forcefully. They did take the dishes away quickly. They're quite strict on their 2 hour seating limit though but it was nice that they give you a last call instead of just cutting you off."}
{"text":"The place deserves a better rating and more recognition. The hate reviews on Google were all about the service and delayed delivery of orders. We had NONE of these negative experience. Food is fantastic and delivered FAST with the restaurant full. Service is great as well. Definitely worth the price and coming back."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: Kaka invited me for a complimentary dinner for two.   The dinner the second time around was leaps and bounds better than my first experience.  The service was courteous and quick.  The food came out quick and accurate.  My last review I said the kitchen food such as the beef was dry but this time everything from the kitchen was hot and fresh.  Although I wished some items on the menu you can order more than just a few pieces per order.  Overall the second dinner here was excellent and I've gone back for their lunch menu as well.  The only concern I have is the dinner price.  At $35 for dinner I think it's a bit on the high side, but you do get delicious sushi rolls you won't get anywhere else.  Good luck Kaka, thanks for having us again."}
{"text":"If youre looking for decent quality aburi sushi without killing your wallet, then kaka would be the place to go. They have a wide selection of different sushi, sashimi, vegetable and meat side dishes, but the most notable item on their menu is the aburi sushi. Unlike a lot of other ayce restaurants, kaka actually puts an effort into the quality of food they serve to you. Of course they cant compare to other sushi restaurants that specialize in aburi or sashimi, but for the price you pay, its quite worth coming back to once a while to fill your belly."}
{"text":"Busy as always, when you call, they don't pick up and their voice mail is always full. My friend had to drop by to make a reservation the week before. On a Friday, they only had 9:30pm slot available for 6 and when we arrived, we STILL had to wait 20mins... This was back in December.   At that point I was literally about to implode... Don't mess with a hungry woman. As soon as they called us up, the waitresses were so apologetic, polite and nice that I couldn't stay angry. I was caught by surprise as I'm so used to pretentious or over-worked-hate-my-job/life waitresses in ayce sushi restaurants.   I admit I may be partially biased because I was starving then. But it was honestly one of the best AYCE sushi places I've been to in Toronto. I don't mind paying the higher than average cost for the quality since it's a rare occasion when I gorge myself in AYCE. Even though the selection wasn't massive, they had unique sushi and dishes that set them self apart from any other AYCE. Many of the sushi you can order 1 or 2 pieces from what I recall, so it's great for small groups to try a variety from their menu. We went all out on the ipad ordering food and they did not miss one item. *claps  Must Try - Their specialty sushi only available on the weekend (1pc per customer), which is the middle pic in the collage - The waitress would come out with this set first without you even ordering which is the best when you're super hungry and can't wait. The best on the menu and sets off the whole experience - Torched sushi - Pressed sushi  - They had a variety of dessert choices  - I tried one each but some of the choices ran out at our time like the parfait and ganache squares. My fav besides the ice cream = creme brulee - all flavours, mango lychee slush - beef tataki - spring egg (I didn't get to try but my friend said it was really good) *Note - Sashimi selection is limited. They don't have butterfish, the tuna also is a bit mushy but the salmon was fresh.Their quality sushi, kitchen food and dessert really make up for it."}
{"text":"All the hype from friends telling how great this place is and I really had to try it!   Well two people 2 beers and a bunch of food later the bill was $90 bucks fml.  I could've had proper sushi that actually tasted good for this price.   The food was just meh. Blah.  Crap.  Was there anything good here? No!  Absolutely not! All the sushi we had fell a part before I can even dip it in sauce.  The beef ribs was 80% fat 20% beef.  The selection was minimal they only had few  choices  of sashimi to choose from.    The service was bad.  Asked them to clear off some stuff like 10 times.  Ignored 10 times.  Asked for Wasabi cause they forgot to bring it first time around.  I was again ignored. The worse part was they look right at me and nodded.    I was originally giving them two stars on yelp  but now I've changed it to one! Just cause writing this review reminded me of how bad the experience was."}
{"text":"Kaka was highly anticipated as I have heard so many good reviews from so many of my friends. I would recommend you make a reservation or else you might spend an hour or two waiting in line.   I went on a weekday when it was 24.99,  unfortunately it did not have any of the special sushi's that I wanted like the scallop. The menu was very on par with a lot of all you can eat sushi restaurants, and was pretty mediocre in terms of selections The sashimi selection was very limited, the only good ones were salmon and butterfish. The torched items weren't as good as expected either it tasted like propane.   I liked the green tea crème brûlée though. I would not come back for it."}
{"text":"Kaka is the gold standard of all you can eat sushi in Markham.  It is expensive and you must make reservations in advance, but it's still a favourite for most people. The food and service is great here. They're most known for being one of the first restaurants to offer pressed and torched sushi on an all you can eat menu, which is now starting to become increasingly common. They are located in the First Markham Place plaza, so parking can be a bit of a hassle. The restaurant itself is small but nicely decorated and clean. During dinner hours (even on weekdays) you have to make a reservation or else you'll be waiting for an hour with no guarantee of getting a spot. Additionally, they will actually enforce the seating limit since the demand is so high.  The food quality is great here. On top of their aburi sushi, what also sets them apart is their extensive dessert menu. They serve creme brulee (original and green tea), as well as little mango slushies in shot glasses.   You probably aren't getting the best bang for your buck, but if price isn't an issue at all, go here."}
{"text":"The menu was very unimpressive for the price. There was a few interesting items on the menu, however a lot of standard ayce sushi items are not available.   Also the restaurant had five maroon 5 songs on repeat the whole night"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my experience at KAKA. Booked reservations about 2-3 weeks in advanced and they called, texted, and emailed to remind us of our seating. Once seated we were presented with an iPad to order the food. While going through the iPad they served us the first dish of dinner special sushi (delicious! Wish we could have had more!)  Love the aburi sushi selection and ordered lots! The aburi sushi was delicious. Also ordered the sashimi and it was nice and fresh. The maki rolls are good but I would personally only order the speciality ones as the regular ones have a lot of rice. Non sushi items were quite tasty.   What surprised me the most was how quickly the food almost came. After the initial large order to get dinner going, it was almost instantaneous how quickly things came as we ordered them.   Serive is prompt, decor was nice, restaurant was clean, and food was delicious. Very well run and organized restaurant. Would probably say that this is one of the best (if not the best) AYCE sushi place I've been to - and that there's a reason why reservations are booked so far in advanced. Would definitely recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"Kaka is a modern  \"high end\" all you can eat restaurant with limited food selection. I had made the mistake of taking my 72 year old father to the restaurant for his birthday.   We arrived at 4:45 pm and were asked if we can leave by 6:10 pm. We agreed to this arrange without knowing that the food would be slow - sashimi would be extra show. Twenty to thirty minutes into our meal, the sashimi was still nowhere in sight. While the seafood as others mentioned was subpar, the rolls were more than disappointing. The Godzilla roll had one tempura shrimp wrap with rice and drizzled hot sauce and spicy mayo on top.   Several orders were missed.  We were surprised by the low quality rice used at Kaka. We were deeply disappointed in the experience. I am also disappointed in myself for selecting this restaurant for such an important occasion."}
{"text":"The best japanese all you can eat ever!! Despite of the busy place, the service was very good!! I dont have anything to say about the food, all the items we ordered were spectacular!! Very tasty and unique! Definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"I went there when they first opened and it instantly became my favorite all you can eat sushi restaurant. Sadly, I've noticed that their quality isn't as good as it used to. However, they still continue to be my favorite. Their sushi options are very unique and their desserts are delicious."}
{"text":"Decided to come because my sister said it was the best all you can eat sushi place ever.  To be honest it's alright. It's not something I would think it's the best ever.  There are some dishes that were good like their ox tongue and their steak.  There are some sushi that'll is better but not like omg better.   Plus I found the price too expensive For AYCE.  The people are nice and the food did come out quick.    I would only go back if someone pays for me."}
{"text":"\"how much is the bill?\" \"$40.95.\" \"You're lying\" \"no it's actually $40.95\" *faints*  If you are willing to pay the price for good quality sushi, nice wait staff, and the most amazing Mango Lychee slush dessert in the world, Kaka All You Can Eat is the perfect place for you.  I don't think I've ever felt so satisfied about the taste of the sushi at an AYCE restaurant before. Honestly, the sushi tasted really fresh, there wasn't too much rice, and the sashimi slices were twice the thickness of most other AYCE places. I was thoroughly impressed.  The wait staff too were really nice. They always had smiles on their faces when they served us, and were very courteous to us, even though our party of 11 was kind of (really) loud.  Some general pointers I have for what to order:  Say yes to: - grilled king oyster mushroom - this sounds really disgusting but it tastes AMAZING. - torched sushi (especially the beef one!!!) - sashimi (fresh and generous portions) - greek yogurt pudding with mango puree - mango lychee slush (one of us ate 15)   Say no to: - the green salad (too much dressing, and it's not even the typical japanese dressing) - the grilled eggplant - the grilled salmon (was too fatty in my opinion) - beef sashimi (acidic raw beef just isn't my style) - Godzilla (it's not actually godzilla)  But of course, do keep in mind the prices of Kaka Sushi if you are on a budget. It's really difficult to find the AYCE prices online, so make sure you know what you are getting into.  Thanks Kaka All You Can Eat!"}
{"text":"Don't call it all you can eat if you only do all you can eat on weekends and holidays. I came here today for a work lunch and was pretty upset when they handed us a very limited lunch menu and told us that there is no all you can eat on weekdays, only on weekends and holidays. I asked when this started happening because I was here in March on a weekday for dinner and it was all you can eat. She claims that they never have all you can eat on weekdays. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night with friends that had placed this dinner reservation two weeks prior, which meant that I had high expectations coming into this restaurant. I was pleasantly surprised by all of the dishes; they were all delicious, except for the eel pressed sushi. I liked that you order on an iPad so you can go at your own pace. Some tips: 1. Although not stated, rolls (e.g., spicy tuna roll, dynamite roll) come in 3 pieces while almost everything else comes in single pieces, 2. According to friends, the lamb with potato tastes very game-y and came in quite a big portion. 3. Save room for desserts or maybe start with selection of desserts? Service was also very good - The food came fast and the empty plates were also taken away quickly. Why not 5 stars? There were many dishes that I wanted to try that were not available. If I am paying $31 for dinner, I think it's fair to expect that I should be able to try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"Cute place to go eat, but definitely not enough tables clearly since me and my date had to eat at a half table in between two awkward couples. Everything came pretty quick in small amounts so make sure to order two of everything. Such was good, and sushimi was great. Dessert was for sure the best part. The two pictures uploaded were the seaweed shrip tempura and the second one is something i did not order and did not taste well."}
{"text":"This is probably like the worst sushi all you can eat place I've tried so far with this kind of price. The fish are not fresh at all and I've gotten a stomachache from it. Never gonna go back again. I would prefer ichiban all you can eat than kaka for sure."}
{"text":"To be honest, i was so excited to come eat at this all you can eat sushi resto but it turns out i overestimated it. Overall an average good sushi place where u can order through a tablet"}
{"text":"The restaurant is new and clean.  We had our first dinner here this evening; group of four. You need to make reservations 2-3 weeks ahead or be prepared to wait 1-2 hours for a table if you just walk in.   We had pretty good service, considering its AYCE. You order through the iPad and 95% of our orders came with no problem. Our last order got missed; when we told the server, she quickly ran to get our missed order. Staff were pleasant and helpful in our experience.  Its $30.99 for dinner on weekend which is a bit steep IMO. They have a good selections of apps, sushi, and desserts. However we were disappointed with the selections for sashimi; there were only about 4-5 choices (salmon, tuna, tai, beef); quality of sashimi was good enough for AYCE, nothing to rave about.  There seemed to be good selections to sushi but they didn't have too many premium rolls (considering they are charging premium price), for example they don't have spider rolls. Many people rave about the torched sushi. We thought it was just okay; obviously no comparison with the a la cart places.   Last but not least, we were very excited with the dessert selections at first glace. However, we were disappointed this evening as quite a number of the items on the menu wasn't available (such as banana something cream pie, mango ice cream, mango pudding , sticky toffee pudding). At least 1/3 of the dessert items werent available but we still paid full price. The ones that we did get to try were decent quality (vanilla creme brulee, green tea creme brulee, early grey square, mango slushie).  Overall, it was okay experience, however, I am not sure if its worth all the hassles.  You have to make reservations way in advance (I don't know about you guys but when we hang out with our friends we don't really decide what to eat 3-4 weeks in advance). Parking in First Markham during dinner rush on weekend is difficult (not impossible). Lastly, the price is a bit steep for what it is. Not everything on the menu is available."}
{"text":"Really good dinner. This is place is one of the best sushi ayce I have been to yet. The quality of the fish is very high. However some of the standard dishes like the hand rolls, the maki rolls and the tempura are nothing worth writing home about. The appetizers are amazing, I truly recommend their spring eggs and the lobster bisque. The draw factor for myself was the blow torched sushi and the larger than normal desert menu. All the blow torched sushi was delicious, the only one I didn't love was the beef one which was a tad too sweet.   I definitely recommend this place, although a tip is to actually make the reservation in person rather than calling. It's certainly a lot easier"}
{"text":"Great place and Delicious foods! I have been waiting to try this restaurant for half month, can't get the reservation! Hot Restaurant! But definitely worth a try,  must try the beef teriyaki!"}
{"text":"I'm quite a huge fan of the Markham location of this restaurant so being a downtowner, when I heard that they were opening a kaka just a few minutes from my condo, I was ECSTATIC. I came here during their opening week and sad to say I was quite disappointed. Their torched sushi is still amazing but quite a few things were lacking.  First of all, I was a little offput with their ordering style. They told me their IPads wouldn't be set up for another few months so to order, you literally had to tell your waitress which items you wanted off the menu - my bf and I found this a little inconvenient especially since you're practically ordering 80% if not more, of the menu. At least they could give you pen and paper?  Secondly, they missed quite a few of our items.. we had to hunt down our waitress to ask if more items were coming, or to tell them we got something we didn't order. Not sure if this was just because they were overall a little unorganized or if their staff was still undergoing training.   Thirdly, they didn't have all of their items on their menu - especially the dessert. We went on a weekday around 7pm, and more than half of their dessert menu was \"unavailable.\" When you're paying $34.99, you expect them to have everything on the menu.   Needless to say, I won't be coming back to the downtown location for at least 3-4 months, until hopefully things are a little more organized."}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant zero stars I would. Had reservations for Saturday night at 6 o'clock. Arrived at the restaurant 20 minutes late due to the fact that there was no parking. I was then told by our server that because we were late that we only had one and a half hours to order and finish our meal. The table beside us was seated at the same time as us but we're still able to have their two hour eating limit. I think that's very unfair, I understand that we were late but it wasn't our fault there was no parking whatsoever in the parking lot, They could've just treated our reservation as a walk-in. I have heard many good things about this restaurant but will definitely not return."}
{"text":"Service was great, liked quick Ipad style order system, food was served to my table very quickly, liked more varieties of food choices compared to other ayce sushi restaurants in Toronto. And the cute desserts were very nice finish"}
{"text":"No chopsticks no plates for soy sauce when food is ready on table lol. Service is lower than average. Also there was hair in the plate of BBQ beef short ribs. But at least sushi is better than their Markham location. First time here and a bit upset."}
{"text":"The thing that got me right away was that this place was smack dab in the middle of a sea of really good restaurants. So you would think that they were bringing their A game to the table. I was completely underwhelmed. Lunch for two with tax and tip came out to $75. So if you are going to charge that much with all that competition around you had better be the best. Sumo, Shitake and even Spoon and Fork deliver much better food, with much better service at a cheaper price. We asked for tea and carbonated water. We got back regular water and when I asked to get carbonated water or a Perier (because the lady did not understand what I was asking for) I was told they did not have that. Okay I did not want to press the point but what kind of place charging that much does not have some sort of bottled carbonated water solution on hand? When the food came it did so quickly, no complaint there. Bottom line though, we wont be going there again."}
{"text":"I always look forward to Kaka All You Can Eat.  There's a good selection of Japanese food that can be ordered through a touch pad.  Unlike some other AYCE restaurants, you can get sashimi for lunch.  The latest popular items are torched sushi that's so tender that they melt in your mouth.  The food has always been fresh everytime i go there.  Service is also pretty decent.  They are always attentive.  The only issue i have with Kaka is that sometimes we don't get the food we ordered, and have to remind the wait staff that we have been waiting for the items for a while.   Besides that,  going to Kaka has always been a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Remember to make reservations as they're busy and don't have a lot of seating! I had dinner on a Saturday night and I made my reservation on Friday afternoon. The only available times were 5pm, 8pm and 9pm. I was excited to try it because I've heard a lot over the past year, but I think the food was mediocre. I expected a wider variety/larger selection of food. What I enjoyed most was the torched sushi - it was delicious. The salmon sashimi was pretty fresh. The service was good and the restaurant and bathrooms were clean. However, at over $40/person (after tax and tip), I don't think I will be returning."}
{"text":"Not worth the hype. If you're looking to go just for the experience, by all means. But, trust me it is not worth it.  I went oh a weekday night paying about $35 with tax and tips. Can pops are $1.99..  First tip, reserve a table well in advance. I have tried numerous times to reserve a table, even with two weeks notice, they're fully booked. I received this reservation after a month in advanced bookings. Even when we made reservations, we had to wait 15 minutes for a table. If you wanted to drop by, good luck trying to get a table!they text you to remind you of your reservations and will ask you to message them back if you have questions. Btw, they do not respond and calling them, well, you'll be put on hold. Find your answers on Google.   Second tip, if you're planning to go because of the famous \"torched\" sushi, it's relatively interesting, but again, not worth the hype.   Third tip, if you're waving down a waiter, make eye contact and yell. They tend to ignore you if you just stick your hand up.   Overall, again not worth the hype, not worth the wait, you're better off going to another ayce sushi like Yamato for relatively the same deep pocket's price. If you're here for the experience, like I said, please lower your expectations.   On a positive note, Portions are evenly distributed. Maki rolls usually come with six. They come with three, which is good for those who want to try a lot of things.   Oh, for those who have weak stomachs, I do not recommend this place. My stomach is fairly sensitive so it reacted fairly quickly and left me with stomach pain for the rest of the night, which carried on to the next day. So eaters beware!"}
{"text":"Fresh, Fast, and Fabulous!!! The BEST Japanese All You Can Eat Restaurant in GTA! The dinner special dishes are really good. Like their touched sushi, all kinds of Dragon rolls, udon, teriyaki beef and chicken, and desert. Use the iPad just click, click, click, and the food just come, come, come. It's a dream come true for a food lover like me, lol!"}
{"text":"12pm weekend lunch.  unagi tasted like cold eel, no sauce and no sear.  spicy salmon was just bland.  quality has gone down a lot. LOTS of items are gone from the menu now. will not return"}
{"text":"Honestly this was my first time coming here with my mom after seeing some reviews on yelp, but for the price -- I would rather go to Tenichi.  Same price for both lunch and dinner but with mediocre to lacking sushi.  Rice was not packed down for the sushi and fell apart, eel sushi was not torched at all and looked like it came out of a can. I'm not impressed.   Overpriced for the quality of sushi. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Great service and atmosphere. The food is so good that hard to leave some space for the dessert, but you have to try it. I would recommend this place to sushi lovers."}
{"text":"Taste good but u don't get what u've ordered. It would be better if they put a limit from beginning! It is not AYCE,  staff decides what u get.  Washrooms need attention. There are ample parking space."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend on a weekday around 5:30pm and the place was already packed with people! The line up system is pretty good as it gave us the freedom to explore around the area as we wait. We waited for 30min ish and got lead to the dinning area. We ordered all their feature items (unfortunately some were out), and every item was prepared and presented in an inviting way. My favourite was the oshi and aburi sushi. They were layered sushi rice with ingredient both on the top and in the middle, served with already prepared sauce. Overall the food and desert were surprisingly good (not something you would expect from all you can eat for sure!)"}
{"text":"FAQ - Yes, call and make a reservation in advance. I called a week ahead and received a 5pm reservation, I didn't have a choice in selecting the time. - They are BUSY! They were polite to me primarily because I was polite too. Pretty sure they deal with some awful customers, hence their attitude. Such is the industry of Markham AYCE. It's a combination of bad customers and sometimes the boss. - Food has a wonderful presentation. Okay yes, it's average-quality sushi. And yeah $30 is pricey for average-quality, but there's unlimited tako wasabi, torched sushi (3 choices), pressed sushi (2 choices), desserts (MANY CHOICES), and ika. I cannot name an AYCE that serves all of this.  ON SERVICE Two hour limit for us!! They will rush you out on multiple occasion like this: 1) Take the iPad from you (with your permission) 2) Drop off the bill 3) Credit card machine 4) Clean up table, again. They try their best to be polite about it but they really wanted us out. For the record, it was a catch-up date with two of my really really really really good friends.  I didn't find the service rude at all. They were nice to me, also because we weren't trying to make their lives miserable. We smiled and smiled and thanked them, that's really all they want. What I hate is when servers receive a smile or thank you, and they still treat me like trash. THAT is gross and happens in many restaurants. Not at Kaka. Yet.  The restaurant is very small. They're probably at their capacity though. If they add anymore tables, the food quality and service will suffer.  ON FOOD The meat was not so good. I only liked our very first lamb skewer. The special sushi and rolls were hit and miss. We loved particularly the Crazy Monkey (with mango) and spicy salmon. I also love tako wasabi (yummmmmmmmmmmmmmm) and they were generous with the octopus. Definitely happy.  Everything was mostly good! I love their system: 1 piece per item except for rolls (that's 3 pieces). Therefore when you order a skewer, it's one skewer. If you order takoyaki, it's one takoyaki. For rolls (any roll), it's 3 pieces only. I LOVE THIS. It's much more manageable and we never had to guess.  Our ribs never came. Oh well. As long as my 8 orders of tako wasabi came!!  YAY I'M A FAN!  lastly, on desserts. just because everyone wants to know: - mango and lychee slushie, that's what that is - mango pudding - red bean, green tea, or vanilla ice-cream - cheesecake with a thin layer of candy coating on top - coffee pudding with a thin layer of candy coating on top - chocolate custard + more, but I forgot They taste exactly as you'd expect. It's not \"OMG THIS IS A MIRACLE\" but they're not bad. We happily ordered everything.  lastly, lastly. The iPad ordering system isn't new. I actually forgot what it's like to NOT have the iPad! Even though I am already spoiled, THANKS FOR INVESTING!"}
{"text":"This place is not worth the wait time and price. A lot of people come here for the torched sushi but I think it's terrible. The torched sushi I had was over torched so it just tasted like smoke. The only thing it deserved a star for was it's dessert options. There are a lot more options for Japanese food nowadays, so I would only come here as a last resort."}
{"text":"Came here on a friday night.  A little disappointed, we would write down our orders, but still have items missing by end of the meal.  We ordered miso soup and took like the 3rd order submission and some asking to get our miso soups.  I will say the miso soup is probably the best here out of all the sushi buffet places i have had.  Had a nice creamy miso and not overly salty like most places.  All the torched sushi i had was basically cold.  It doesnt have that same smokey flavour when its cold, so that was a bit disappointing.  They basically have a tray of the torched sushi premade in bulk so unless its going fast, thats going to sit cold.   Dessert variety was good and although i did not have any of the green tea creme brulee, but my friends said they were good.  Service is a bit hit and miss, i had originally put in first order of 20 pieces of salmon sashimi for 3 people, the plate came with 10.  I asked and said i had ordered 20 pieces, and waitress basically said with a rude tone 'you can order again'  After tax and tip... it comes out to about $45 a person, and for that price i would rather go somewhere else."}
{"text":"love love love their torched sushi! They are amazing. Food quality is pretty good comparing to a lot of ayce places out there."}
{"text":"Phenomenal. Everything was so fresh, fantastic flavours and excellent service. Don't forget to try the oysters with cheese and the sashimi!"}
{"text":"This place is pricy but is worth it definitely a 3.5/5. I love their torched menu items, beef tongue/lamb sqewers.. My most favorite dish though have been complimentary dishes though lol. One time I went we received a complimentary plate of baked cheese clams and another time we got a complimentary platter of assorted torched sushi (which was not on the ayce menu) they were both amazing.. if those were on the ayce menu I'd definitely give this place a 4 or 5 even. One thing I don't like about this place is the ayce sushi/torched items have alot of mayo, a tiny bit of fish and a lot of rice. They have surprising good wings lol even though you'd think ayce is the last place to find good wings. Try their wasabi and buffalo wings. Also the mango slush in the dessert menu is very refreshing :)"}
