{"text":"We've been to many Filipino joints but Tagpuan has one of the best breakfast in the city. My favourite is the Tosilog (cured pork, fried egg, and veggies) and the Filipino style spaghetti. They also have a small grocery for your needs. If you haven't tried and been wanted to try Filipino breakfast, this is the joint to go to."}
{"text":"This is the best Filipino Restaurant I've been in the Toronto area... For those who gave 1 star. I wonder if you gave the workers attitude too, that is why you didn't get the service that you deserve.  Tagpuan have the best pancit palabok and sisig. The chef is from Pampanga which are famous filipino cooks. I suggest try visiting Tagpuan again with a smile :-)   I leave in Mississauga and I do go to Tagpuan every time I go to the east end."}
{"text":"At your own risk if you eat here. We all got food poisoning. Me and a group of my coworkers bought a variety of take outs for lunch to share at work. Sisig, bicol express, and dinuguan. We all got really sick that same day up until the next few days. We had constant diarrhea and nausea along with cramps, fever, extreme chills, and body aches. I missed work for a week because of this. My doctor diagnosed it as Salmonella. He said it could have been leftover foods re-cooked and served again or the meats prepared were still raw. I had never had food poisoning and this has been my worst and unpleasant experience. I am never coming back. Also, Their customer service is not that great either. Disappointing!"}
{"text":"Have recently been craving the classic home-style Filipino breakfast that our old school Filipino grandparents/parents would literally raise us on every morning. I have been searching all over Toronto to get my Filipino breakfast fix and low and behold I found my satisfaction in this small hidden gem of a corner restaurant in Victoria Park.  In comparison, this place hands down has to be the best place for a classic Filipino breakfast - Tapcilog, Tocilog or Longcilog.   (For my non-Filipinos this means some type of marinated meat OR Longcilog - Sweet Filipino Sausage, all served with garlic fried rice topped with a couple of runny over easy eggs)  They provide good quality, tasty food. I need to stress the fact that they cook their Longanisa, Tocino, and Tapa FRESH. At most Filipino restaurants they prepare ALL their food pre-made and keep it in a food warming display. With Tapa, Tocino, and Longanisa this makes the meat dry and hard almost like unintentional meat jerky. Although they do have a variety of food in warming displays their breakfast is always made fresh to order which provides you with hot, tender and juicy meat. For the portion size of their food, the price is a steal you will definitely leave full and happy. This restaurant also doubles as a small Filipino convenient/grocery store and is very clean. I have to say I am pleasantly surprised and very satisfied. I highly recommend coming here for an affordable, filling, classic, tasty Filipino breakfast and will continue to come back.  Note for my English speaking or non-Filipinos:  All these meat dishes are served with Garlic Fried Rice and 2 runny over-easy eggs.  Tapcilog or Tapa - Garlic, soy sauce and lemon OR vinegar marinated pork or beef. Tocilog or Tocino - Sweet, brown sugar, soy sauce and garlic marinated pork. MY FAVORITE AND YOU CANNOT GO WRONG. Longcilog or Longanisa - Sweet and savory Filipino Sausage sort of tastes like Tocino in sausage form."}
{"text":"Tagpuan is a filipino (Pang masa) Restaurant.  They renovated the place and now you can dine-in just like the FV foods at warden.   The food is good. No complaints and its always packed with lots of filipinos dahil masarap pagkain nila.   The only thing is even though its already renovated, they still need to renovate.  Its still small and they need to organize it MORE.   FOOD:  taste wise: 9 /10  PLACE: Restaurant size: 7/10.  SERVERS / Employees: 9/10."}
{"text":"I'm not 100% what has happened to this place. But the few times I've recently gone here has been absolutely terrible!  I believe the management has changed actually, and maybe even the chef. The usual faces I always saw at Tagpuan are never there now. That's where I get my assumption.  Food is terrible in flavour and quality, service is so-so instead of being perfect.   My heart is broken, as I thought I had found my go to Filipino place here in Scarborough.  With my recent experiences, I don't see myself returning here. I gave them many chances, honestly not believing how this place has flipped upside down. Maybe a year down the road, I'll try this place again. Such a shame, as they were a complete 10/10."}
{"text":"HIGHLY RECOMMEND! I've gone to this restaurant probably a dozen times and I'll keep coming back. The prices for the hot items are pretty reasonable, and they can be freshly prepared. Their halo-halo is nice to enjoy in the summer and it's very refreshing. Their fried calamari is always fresh and crispy which makes a lot of people come back to the store. Their fried rice never upsets me as it's fresh as well. Breakfasts are good anytime of the day! It may not be 100% authentic Filipino food, but it's still close (maybe it has a bit of Chinese influence, but it's still awesome)  The staff are friendly whenever I visit, but I haven't really seen any rude workers like mentioned in a few reviews.   In-store experiences are good, since it's nice to eat dinner while watching Filipino TV channels and having free coffee or water.  Bottom line, if you wanna find a good dinner at a reasonable price, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND coming here!"}
{"text":"They have a wide selection of Hot food. Their pork BBQ is very tender and a lot of flavor. They also have deep fried chicken skin, kilawin isda, assortment of rice cakes. I tried their cassava cake and I will definitely be coming back. This is a hidden gem in Victoria park area."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Myself and my gf have come in on separate occasions and on those occasions we were the only customers in there.   As I stood by the food counter I was not acknowledge by the 3 ppl working behind the counter.  I had to interrupt their conversation to ask them for a particular item that I was looking for which they didn't have. My gf and I ended up picking something up but was completely ignored at the cash by the 3 associates behind the cash.  I had to get her attention which I didn't feel I needed to as I was obviously ready to cash out.  And whoever that lady was working behind the cooked food counter shouldn't be chewing with her mouth open.  Specially when serving food.  Disgusting.  My gf has also received the same service.   This place may be near by but I'd rather travel for better service.  Never returning."}
{"text":"This doesn't even deserve one star!!! I've probably been here about three times. All occasions were basically horrible! Being a filipino I am mostly disgusted in the service and the attitude of the owner and the workers. Number one, if you don't look filipino they'll just give you more attitude. Believe me, I've given it back to them IN FILIPINO as well. Once the worker told me in Filipino she thought I was coloured! Rude! Just came from there yesterday near Closing time to purchase their \"turon\". After the lady said they had none, all three workers turned their back. I decided to purchase something else. My BF and I were standing there for a good two minutes. Lady looks at us while chewing with her mouth open and doesn't even acknowledge us. Are we looking at her for no reason? My BF asks her if we can pay.... Again, just the look and then serves us!!! THREE PEOPLE??? And it takes your customer to grab your attention???? Another instance I went, long Line up to get cooked food. No organization to the line. Only way you'll get service is if You open your mouth demand For service or ask where the proper line up is.... So I Say this... As a Filipino, if you're not Filipino good luck getting around here. Like I said, I don't look it and Got the worst service in my life. If my mom went in, I'm sure they would be kissing her behind with excellent Service. Even so, my BF who looked it Got the worst service of his life and will never return. If you don't want to be irritated with the long wait and bad service I suggest not To go. All occasions I've only been there when I needed something on an urgent basis. Will I go again??? Never!!!!! Absolute horrible experiences... Disgrace to the Filipino heritage."}
{"text":"It's clean, there's a good number of available booths and tables, the food is fresh (at least on Saturday morning it is) and you get free coffee if you dine in.   Stopped in for some breakfast; ordered tapa, sisig and pinakbet with rice. Ladies serving food were sweet and gladly gave us extra calabasa (squash) and ampalaya (bittermelon) upon request.   The tapa was tender not dried out like jerky; the sisig came on a sizzling plate with a raw egg on top. The sisig was full of pig ears (hubby would love this) but lacked spice. I enjoyed the veggies the most, good flavor in the pinakbet.  I've had their pork bbq on a stick before and it was really good. Thick tender pieces with just a little bit of fat all coated in a yummy carmelized  bbq sauce."}
{"text":"We ordered from here for a birthday. People were enjoying the food until one person noticed something that shouldn't be there, a big fat cockroach. Everyone who saw this was disgusted and couldn't eat the food anymore. Me and my friends plan on NEVER ordering from here again. This place must not be clean at all to have bugs crawling in their food. Stay away from here."}
{"text":"Not bad. I go here to order Tapsilog specially on rainy days when I'm feeling particularly homesick (Philippines homesick) and it brings me right back to where my heart is.  As far as customer service and dine in experience goes, well it will all depend on what you expect.  I don't think this is where their effort lies in as much as they do the authenticity of their products.  Authenticity?  Product and foodwise - they've pretty much got it down perfectly."}
{"text":"I don't think this restaurant need any star! The customer service SUCKS! Some food is being recycle for the next dish. The food can be too much oily,dry or salty. the taste of that filipino food that you're looking for is not there. GOOD LUCK EATING HERE!"}
