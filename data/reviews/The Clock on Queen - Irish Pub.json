{"text":"I am not much of a person to write a reivew, however I was blown away when I recently visited this new Pub Bar/Restaurant- The Clock on Queen (love the name):). All I can say is that it has become my favourite Pub. The food was terrific, the service impeccable, the drinks are generous and the price reasonable.

Excellent pub food and great atmosphere and the Guinness is good, good, good.

The atmosphere is laid back, the staff all were very genuinely friendly. Great TV's for all types of sport games to view. 

Favourite menu items: The kabob sizzler, black and tan onion rings and the Irish nachos....yum. 

I wish I were there right now! A must place to visit!!"}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere!

Sizzling Kebob and Chicken wings are some of the best I have had.

Highly Recommend this place"}
{"text":"Okay so I must say that I have had only great experiences at clock on queen.

happy eatings!

{"text":"It's about as \"Irish\" as New Delhi. 
  The beer is standard fare. The food is mostly Indian, with very little Irish content at all; calling something a \"Dublin club\" or a \"Belfast burger\" does not make it anything other than a club or a burger. Having said that, the portions are large. The service has been uneven on the couple of occasions I have been there.
  If these places want to be \"authentic\", the first thing they need to get rid of is all the giant TVs blaring constantly."}
{"text":"I was in the area on a business trip and stumbled across the Clock. I enjoyed my Fish n' Chips and the beers they served. The staff was friendly and service was quick. There are lots of TVs around so you can see sports or whatever."}
{"text":"The food here was terrible as well as the service. Waited over 20 mins for a glass for a pitcher I ordered. It took the waitress over 45 mins to take my food order and then order came out wrong. Won't be back again."}
{"text":"Looking for a pub in Brampton can be a task...I looked on Yelp and found \"The Clock on Queen\" me and the wife gave it whirl.  Located in a little strip mall on the south side of Queen st and Bramalea. It looks small, but the inside has ample seating with banquettes and hightops.  There is also a lounging area in the back of the pub below the massive Guinness logo painted on the wall.

We sat down and were quickly greeted by our server who welcomed us.  I used the Yelp check in offer (free personal size Irish nachos) as an appetizer for us.  We looked at our menus and ordered drinks.  Our drinks came quickly as did our Irish Nachos.  Waffle fries with cheese, bacon, green onions and sour cream, a pretty tasty combo!!  Shortly after we finished our nachos our lunch orders came out.  The wife had a BLT sandwich and fries and I had the 2 piece haddock fish and chips.  The BLT was good, but the sourdough bread that it was served with was toasted too much, thus making the bread very hard to bite through.  My fish and chips were a good size portion and the fish tasted fresh.

The one thing I have to comment on is the sides of gravy.  The taste was excellent, with hints of Guinness beer flavoring the gravy, but the portion bowls that they came in were huge!! Most places give you a little ramikin of gravy, but here they served it in bowls.  Excellent idea!! Good to dip your fries or sandwiches in and there is enough that you wont run out.  A welcome change from the little cups that gravy is usually served in.  The Clock on Queen has a somewhat Irish flair to its menu, but there is definitley an Indian flavor to some of the items on the menu (i.e Butter chicken poutine and definitely some others)  The food was good, and the service was friendly."}
{"text":"This is a relatively new restaurant close to where we live. We went in on a Monday nite (that may have been our mistake, doubt it). To start with our waitress was nice but less then interested in her work. Most of the time she spent at the bar sucking a pop or equivalent & spending time on her cell. 

The food...I ordered the chicken fingers \"smothered\" in sauce. They can out barely covered in sauce, mistake #1. The grilled chicken sandwich was dry, the bun was stale & incorrectly prepared, mistake 2. I just ordered with no mayo & no cheese. They messed that simple request up as well. Combining poor wait staff, mistake #3. Poor quality food & incorrect order gives this place a 1-star! Not a do-over!!"}
{"text":"Gotta try the irish nachos.  Amazing.  The belfast burger looked really good and big.  I ordered the fish and chips and the fish was really good, only thing I didn't like is that the tartar sauce was packaged and not homemade.  I will go again."}
{"text":"The worst food ever! crappy thin over cooked burgers, burnt nachos with almost no toppings! 
fish and chips were awful batter was soggy, and tasted like the fryer had not been cleaned in months.

fair price on beer for what they had which was not much mainly just what was on tap. they said they sold out of all other beer. seems a bit strange for a Friday night.

I tried to talk to the bartender about the food and was waved off as if I was disturbing her from playing games on her phone!!!

Finally got the bill they tried to charge me for a bunch of drinks that we did not order as well as food!!
when brought to the attention of the bartender about this mistake, again was treated like it was my fault. it truly felt like I was not welcome because I was not what seemed to be a \"regular\".

All in all if I could I would shut it down and save a lot of people the headache and disgust I feel for this place now!

END RANT!"}
