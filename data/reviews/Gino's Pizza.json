{"text":"I've been coming from the northwest valley to eat at this pizza joint since I was a very young child... I'm now 26 and I still love this place. Great food and fun pin-ball machines. Everyone should try this place once."}
{"text":"They charge $12 for a chicken parm, which wouldn't be so terrible if they used actual chicken cutlets rather than cheap patties straight from the freezer section at giant eagle. Aaaaand they forgot to deliver said $12 sandwich. Also, the pizza is not good. Honestly, you're better off getting yourself a pie from Milanos."}
{"text":"Gino's pizza is as standard as delivery/take out pizza gets. Which is to say that it's tasty, but will not blow you away by any means.   I usually just walk in and order something and then go to Rabba, which is next door while the pizzas are being made. They have a $6.99 medium pep walk in special which is a pretty reasonable deal."}
{"text":"Extremely rude staff!  Was told 4 min on a large pizza. After 30 min I asked if it was close to being done and was flipped out on. Then had a partially cooked pizza pulled out and hastily chopped up and thrown on the counter. Got my refund and walked out. F this place"}
{"text":"Sam (the phone operator) has provided the worst customer service because he is discriminating against me because I am not from Canada & do not have a Canadian phone number.  He refused to take my order.   NEVER ORDER FROM THIS ESTABLISHMENT and DO NOT Support Discrimination."}
{"text":"This particular Gino's is terrible. Staff is beyond  rude, pizza is not good.   But when I made a complaint to higher ups bc of my bad experience, they did take care of me. To the point that when I order, I will no longer be getting my food from that location."}
{"text":"\"I guess nothing is ever as good as you remember it\" -Marge Simpson Unfortunately, I tend to forget why Gino's pizza is the most awful pizza place in Arizona.  About every four years I forget that they use the world's worst watered down sauce, synthetic tasting, plastic-like cheeses and toppings, and a crust that seems to only consist of equal portions of flour and water. That leads to forcing myself into a journey that reminds me that this place is a poor excuse for a pizza parlor.  It's clear this place has a steady stream of customers, (the owner flaunts an ever changing sports car out front of the restaurant). How else could he afford to drive nice vehicles? That leads me to believe that there are like-minded saps who make a residual journey every few years to find out why it's been so long since there last visit.  On a positive nod to nostalgia, they still have the same arcade games I fed quarters to as a child. That tends to bring a lighter side to each visit.   It is very clear that this is the worst pizza (find out for yourself!), but at least you can always rely on the on that consistency."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what I should expect of wings from a pizza place. I'm giving it 1 star because the chicken was edible and cooked. It was bland and soggy, as if it was microwaved, and not \"baked\". The guys wasn't wearing any apron or hats, and looked a little confused. I'm not sure what the regulations are anymore, buy It didn't make me feel comfortable... Sorry!"}
{"text":"Ordered a couple pizzas from here since their special was better than other competitors. When they arrived, I noticed one of the boxes had oil leaking out of the bottom. As I opened it I realized the entire half of the pizza box was literally filled with some random oil and had soaked the pizza to the point where it was a soggy mess. The second pizza wasnt anywhere near as bad but still incredibly greasy to the point of staining the bottom of the box. Literally the most disgusting thing I've received from a delivery person, definitely will not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"This restaurant a while back changed from a 341 Pizza to a Gino's Pizza which is unfortunate because all Gino's Pizza chains are fairly bland cardboard type pizza.   The prices for an extra large walk in is still around $10 at this location but it's really average pizza and you can get a pizza around the same size from quite a few other locations around here like 241 or Pizza Hot Pizza or Pizza Pizza. Unfortunately, they're all the same cardboard tasting generic pizza with fairly little in terms of sides.  I don't mean to say that the pizza is bad by giving it a 2 star review because at the end of the day, it's still pizza. Unfortunately though if you want something really good then all the good pizza places are closer to Dundas or Lakeshore, I haven't found any exclusive pizza place which is that good so far in Northwest Mississauga"}
{"text":"I used to order from Wing Machine and they were terrific. Good food, delivered quickly and hot. Then they got taken over by Gino's Pizza and the business model fell apart! Took 75-90 minutes to deliver even though I lived around the corner.   Ordered last night for the last time from them. Took 90 minutes, pizza was cold, and wanted extra crispy, flat crust, it was neither and it was the wrong pizza!   Customer service was polite, offered me a replacement pie (no thanks!) and a whopping $12 credit on my next order. Sorry guys, lost your last chance. Plenty of (pizza) fish in the sea that is Toronto!"}
{"text":"Will concur with the first review. Wanted to like Ginos because the one in Malton is awesome especially it's slices which are nice and crispy and uber tasty. I ordered the pep, mush and gr pepp pizza  here and what I got looked quite promising but failed to deliver big time. The ingredients were all there in good quantity, all reasonably baked in, but the taste was bland and yucky from the start. The crust was light-crispy and nice, but the sauce was plain disgusting, the green peppers a few weeks old and slimy (though nicely cut up) and the entire thing just a mediocre pizza misadventure you'd come to expect from those old style conveyor ovens (note: mind you, I've had some awesome pizzas from those like Reginos, but mostly crappeola from those style of ovens). I kid you not when I say that a frozen pizza would not taste any different from what I received on this day. I felt the servers were nice, but -despite their close attention to my pizza, which was partly due to lack of customers - their pizza  sucks big time and needs some major overhaul and it's likely in the equipment and ingredient end of things more than labour. I'm sure this location skimps out big time. The sauce was much worse too than the Malton location and the entire pizza tasted radically different in the worst way possible. I thought Gino's would wish to keep their consistency the same across their locations for competitive reasons but I guess that is not the case. Gino's HQ needs some TLC for this poor location because at this point, I would not accept food from them even if it were  free. Sorry."}
{"text":"Our order was 15 minutes late (after already being delayed 10 minutes), driver did not follow delivery instructions, and the order was wrong. Food mediocre at best. When I called the store to talk about the order being incorrect, the manager was rude and hung up on me. I will not order from this place again, and frankly highly recommend that you avoid them if you are reading this. Poor food, poor business."}
{"text":"They had just opened and my wife and I stopped and felt bad for the owner as the power was out. The owner Mike is a real gentleman and provides an excellent pizza at a reasonable price. The ingredients were fresh and the crust was great. Highly recommend it. Jim D"}
{"text":"This place does not even deserve a star. I write this review as a warning as no one should ever feel the disrespect and embarrassment I felt when ordering something as simple as a pepperoni pizza.   This location has given me my worst experience as a paying customer ever. The employees are indifferent and barely know their own menu. The manager is rude and disrespectful. He can not handle a dispute without yelling at us in front of other customers and yelled at us to get out. The experience was utterly humiliating and to top it off they gave us the wrong order at the end. His attitude only changed when he noticed behind us was a security officer waiting and other customers beginning to come to our defence.   The establishment is dirty and unkept. They left one of the employee's children alone to play around with the napkins and customer beverages in the fridge. The child was throwing the drinks at tables and dragged them on the floor, but the employee just put the bottles back in the fridge or set them on a table on the side."}

{"text":"I never write reviews. But I read some reviews here that almost scared me away from Gino's. If you love planned communities, big-box stores and chain restaurants, you will probably find something negative to say about this place, no matter what. I think I'm somewhere in the middle and can (at times) be a food snob, especially when it comes to pizza. I'm from the East coast. I can be very critical of food, in general. I don't really like chain anything. Which is why I gave it a shot, regardless of what I read. So, here's my honest opinion. First, the pizza: I ordered, Reg Crust, extra cheese, onions & bell peppers. The crust is truly super thin. (think flatbread). Everything is fresh. There is nothing wrong with the sauce or cheese. It is adequately flavorful. If you are a big sauce lover, get extra. I think it's fine. Next time I will order Thick crust and won't order extra cheese. Gino's is more than generous with their toppings. The little container of hot pepper seeds were actually Hot! Nice switch from the usually tasteless packets most places give you (mouth still burning, yay!) It's not the prettiest pizza you'll ever eat, but who cares? I don't like the way they cut it (in squares). I will also request that they cut it like a pizza, next time. Second, the location: personally, I like the flavor of So Pho, and so do they. No apologies here. I got the feeling that they embraced diversity and are a little \"edgy\". Yes, they do have old school pinball machines. Cute. Plenty of seating. Clean and comfortable. Service: Outstanding. Super pleasant. Owner on premises. Friendly and helpful people. This is a family business. I love that. All in All, YES, I will go to Gino's again. Next time, thick crust and cut like a pizza. I'm happy."}
{"text":"There were such mixed reviews that I had to find out for myself. I've been looking for a new neighborhood pizza joint and hoped that maybe this place could be it. no No NOOOO WAYYYYYY!!! First: I ordered hot wings, all drummies and extra crispy. The rep said that I couldnt have my requested order because the wings come \"pre-made\", in \"oven-ready containers\". When someone orders wings, they take it out of the fridge and place the container in the oven to heat it up. Therefore, unable to take special requests. The pizza arrived piping hot but I had asked for well done with the cheese brown and bubbly. The cheese was melted. I have to agree with the other reviews, there was an odd taste to the sauce and cheese. I'm from Wisconsin so I can taste real, quality cheese. This was very odd tasting \"cheese\".  The wings were absolutely disgusting. Barely warm. I put them under the broiler after they were delivered and they still tasted rubbery. The skin was drenched in sauce but unable to get crispy, even after my broiler attempt. Very fatty. On a positive  note, the delivery was quick. I wish they would have taken the extra time to at least make an effort to make the customer happy. Honestly, (and my own personal opinion because I'm no expert) I dont think the wings were even at health dept standards.  This was the worst $30 I've ever spent. I encourage people to do more research before settling on Gino's. I'll never order from here again."}
{"text":"This place has had the same owners for quite awhile, and they've mastered the pizza slice! Best place around to grab a slice of pizza, better then Pizza Pizza or Little Caesars which are also close by. I rarely order full pizzas from them, but those are good too."}
{"text":"The taste of the pizza may have been tainted by the rudeness of the delivery driver who was so rude there was no way I could enjoy my pizza after that experience.  After almost knocking me over while handing me my pizza he grumbled under his breath when I asked for change, dropped some of my change on the front step, and walked way without saying a word.  It was so weird... would not order again because the pizza was also pretty tasteless."}
{"text":"The only thing that is good about this place is there 5 dollar medium pizza deal but i can understand now what they made 5 dollars and that is because the pizza there is horrible their pizza is so tough to eat because every time i eat their pizza it always hurts my jaw and don't get it mistaken this pizza was not a leftover pizza it was a Fresh pizza that i ate right away as soon as i got it so it confuses me in why it taste like im eating a pizza that has been sitting there over night. Please like this post if you have had this experience to."}
{"text":"Today is more 3rd time coming here as it is not usually on my way anywhere but for every time I have come I have went out of my way to stop here and order a pizza usually with a local customer of there's  that they seem to be pretty friendly with. Don't get me wrong, the workers are friendly even this time but you know that feeling when you meet someone for the first time? I think I've been coming here about once a year when it's somewhat convenient for me to do so. The pizza has always made the stop totally worth it. If you're like me and pizza isn't just pizza then you'll really enjoy the full flavours and quality of the bread. Sort of like pizza Hut quality here but without the heavy prices."}
{"text":"That's was some good pizza! Found myself a new pizza spot in south Phoenix. You can tell fresh  ingredients very different from popular chains."}
{"text":"As far as pizza places go, they are pretty good.  I like their pizza crust is comparable to other pizza delivery places.  The people are average friendliness, and the place is relatively clean.  One improvement is that they should cut out the MSG in the pizza sauce.  It's not really location specific, but more of a franchise issue."}
{"text":"This is my second trip to Gino's. First trip was absolutely fantastic. Ordered my pie, stopped over, picked it up, and had a great conversation with the dude working the counter.  Second trip?  Ordered online.  Made a stop at Walgreens being that I was told by the site that it would be 25 minutes.  Stopped in, no pizza ready.  Instead, I was told they didn't make it because I didn't answer the call they made to me.  I checked my phone right there, no missed calls.  I was all \"Alright, dude, no worries, cook me up a quick pepperoni, canadian bacon, and green olives\" which he was happy to do.  Told me it would be 10 - 15 minutes.  25 - 35 minutes later, pizza is done.  Get it home, no canadian bacon.  I even tipped those assholes thinking I screwed something up.  Go somewhere better.  While waiting, I saw them opening giant cans of pre-made pizza sauce.  They may have been around for 40 years, but buying store-bought pizza sauce for over priced pizza doesn't make much sense.  Oh, and chop your olives up, you lazy twats.  Like on the first pizza I had from you."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Rouses Point-Champlain! Great prices too! I love their vegetarian pizza and have tried other toppings which was all delicious. Their homemade fries and onion rings are yummy! The baked ziti with meatballs w/salad and garlic bread is a steal for $7 and really good! It's even enough to feed two people as I can never eat more than half of it.  I keep coming back to this place when I don't feel like cooking, and it's always busy which says a lot about how good their food is.  You can get a half-foot subsandwich for only $3 or 1 foot for $5. And they also sell pizza slices for about $2.25. A good place to go for cheap food and actually enjoy it.  The place is very simple, no frills inside, and is more like a to-go place. Nice outdoor patio if you prefer to eat outside. The guy that runs the place is real friendly."}
{"text":"Jan 15th, 16 Order my pizza extra well done and it came under cooked.  The service is great, and they rushed out another one but still not cooked properly.  Although I give an A for Effort the  it is spelled with and \"E\" and that is what the pizza was.  Only had 2 slices!!! Extremely disappointed.    This was my second time ordering from Gino's the 1st was from store #41 in Niagara.  And, although I was very pleased with the quality of the pizza as well as the service I couldn't score it a 5. Maybe store #41 is just that much better than the others...again, very pleased overall."}
{"text":"DO NOT order from here. I would give it 0 stars if I could. I ordered a pizza for take out here and it was about a half inch thick (way too thick) and it came completely raw. The only thing cooked on it was the crust. Even some of the cheese wasn't even melted. My boyfriend ate a few bites before we realized and is now sick. I called to complain and because I didn't have access to a car to pick up another pizza all they offered me was $5 off my next purchase. I wasted $15 on an inedible pizza, do you really think I'm going to spend any more of my money here? Pathetic. What I wanted was a refund. You've lost a customer."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. The people working there are friendly and hard working. The buffalo chicken, meatball, and Philly cheese subs are all fantastic. So is their pizza. You can't beat the price either.   They recently opened a second location in Plattsburgh on Rt 9 near exit 39."}
{"text":"There was hair (not just one hair, like a bunch of hair) in my pizza, it was obviously hair from an Indian person, i'm a blond Caucasian definitely wasn't mine. When I asked them to fix the problem they accused me of trying to scam them, yet I walked out of the pizza place went to my car and literally came back 2 minutes later to show them. I'm blonde! the hair was black an matted!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on my way home, you know the drill, had a few drinks, looking for a slice to soak up the suds. I had their spinach pizza, with sundried tomatoes and feta. I used to think the benchmark of poor was Pizza Pizza, especially since we have so many other options in TO. That said Pizza PIzza was way better than this.  My Gino's slice was literally like cardboard.  Would not go back again."}
{"text":"Pretty bland pizza overall, nothing like Pizza Pizza in terms of quality. It's cheap at least in case you needed a quick fix. Location is minuscule though so good luck sitting comfortably."}
{"text":"We went in yesterday to celebrate my nieces birthday. Our family grew up eating Gino's so we love the place. I'll admit I hadn't been there for a couple of years but the pizza is just as good now as it was then. I think the sauce is a little different but it was still good. We had the peperoni and sausage with green chili pizza. The men working last night were all very nice and friendly and provided excellent service to our group. We will definitely be back!  Note: If you are expecting to come here for gourmet pizza you will be disappointed! If you did not grow up eating Gino's, chances are you will not enjoy it. For most people Gino's is a taste of their childhood. You would never go to Taco Bell for authentic Mexican food so you should not come here looking for true New York style pizza. But, for our family it's the best!"}
{"text":"This pizza place is amazing!  I got a medium pizza with pepperoni, bacon and chicken.  They have an option for barbecue and tomato sauce for the base pizza sauce. Also I got free add ons for oregano and garlic. They have a ton of other options.   The amount of toppings they put on the pizza is great. They don't cheap out at all! They put so much toppings on the pizza you could actually get a taste of each topping in every bite! Way better than pizza pizza, dominos and Pizza Hut who cheap out on the toppings like crazy. Great amount of cheese, cooked perfectly! This will be my new go to pizza place!!!!"}
{"text":"There are a lack of independent pizza places in South Phoenix, the chain pizza places are easy to find sure, but if you are looking for a natural fresh tasting NY style pizza you are out of luck. Which makes it very hard to write this review. Gino's is only 2 miles from me, and it is an independently owned mom and pop type place, so when something like this exists in South Phoenix I want desperately to like it.  The sad reality, for both Gino's and myself, is that this is truly the worst pizza I've ever had. When I say that I mean almost inedible. It's basically a technicality that this pizza passes as edible. For instance the ingredients within may be common for your average pizza, It may even look like pizza, but on every other level something is just wrong with it.  Visually the pizza, while looking like a pizza (round in shape with cheese and sauce), is disheartening at first glance before you even taste it. Unfortunately this is one of the times you can judge a book by a cover. When you bite into a slice it sort of has this film of water to it. Something that immediately forms a barrier between your taste buds and the slice.  Often you will see pizza boxes display that their mozzarella is 100% REAL dairy cheese. When you eat Gino's you can't help wondering if they left that off their boxes for legal reasons. The cheese has this rubbery plastic type texture to it and seems to be absent of taste.This is sub-sub-store brand cheese, in fact it seems like it would be a challenge in itself to acquire a blend of materials so consistently awful. The crust is like cardboard, sometimes even a little burnt. I don't know how this crust was made. It's almost like every time a vital ingredient was left out of the cooking process rendering the pretty funky tasting. It's almost like the main goal of the crust was merely to house the toppings, not to be eaten.   It's so rare i eat a pizza that is disappointing on every level, but in this case that's Gino's. I have traveled around the United States. Ate pizza in New York and in comparison Wyoming and it's trippy to think that the worst pizza i've had is 2 miles from me.  Maybe some day Gino's will go through big changes. that would be great because I really wanted this place to be \"my pizza place\"."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting much but I thought it would be better than Pizza Pizza at least. Pizza was a letdown, bland and almost tasteless. The jalapeño poppers weren't even cooked fully so I had to throw them out. The only reason I'm giving this place two stars is the family that runs it seems very nice and secondly the wings were pretty good for a pizza chain. Overall though, I wouldn't recommend Gino's, do yourself a favour and go to Pizza Nova instead."}
{"text":"I never thought about this place much until it closed its doors a few weeks back. This Gino's location on Lakeshore had been closed for a short time previously (probably because they couldn't pay their rent), but they hung on a little while longer.  It was usually just a place I went to get cheap slices, and that was it. I always found that the pizza tasted too \"cardboard-y\", and it was terrible when it was reheated. Don't know if the quality of the chain went down as a whole or if it was just limited to this location, but it's a far cry from when they first opened in the early 00's.  Coupled with the somewhat scuzzy-looking location and poorly-maintained patio, and you had a place that was more of an eyesore than anything. I can't say I'll miss this place much."}
{"text":"Since moving within a few miles of this location, I've gotten pizza from Gino's countless times. My Check-Ins don't tell the real tale, as I'll often order delivery, or even call in an order for someone else to pick up on their way home.  This has fast become my go to pizza joint in Newmarket. The pizza is consistently good, it's always perfectly cooked, they're pretty generous with their toppings, and my order has always been correct.  The staff are also great. Efficient, friendly, and always on time with my order.  They've also got great deals; especially for walk-in orders. As it stands right now, although I will continue to try other pizza places occasionally, I really don't see any reason for me to go anywhere else for my regular orders."}
{"text":"I find that the men who work here are very creepy. The pizza is mediocre...a little greasy. Had a pizza delivered once to my home, it was a younger indian guy, he was stumbling all around looked like he was drunk to me. Not good if he was drinking and driving."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst tasting and quality pizza I have ever had. It literally tasted similar to the kid's recipe homemade pizza, but worse. And it was more expensive than the big chain pizza places. NEVER. AGAIN."}
{"text":"Serviceable pizza by the slice when you are hungry at 11:30pm on a Saturday night.   Not good but it lines the gut after day drinking."}
{"text":"I ordered a slice of cheesecake and some rice pudding. The cheesecake was frozen and the rice pudding had mold on it. I posted a picture. Yikes. Should have read the reviews before placing my order. The guy didn't apologize on my first call but told me they would deliver a new pudding but it would be awhile because they only had 1 driver. I called back after a few minutes because I wanted to cancel the new pudding - the mold turned my stomach a bit and as I called, I get \"I know I know - the pudding. When we get a driver you'll get it\" as though I was bothering him. He did apologize at the end of that convo but it's no matter because that food was super unhealthy."}
{"text":"Lady at the register is very rude and sarcastic! All I wanted is to enjoy a good meal with my husband! Had to walk out of there and go somewhere......"}

{"text":"Take a vacation from those fancy high price chains and get your butt down to South Phoenix and taste pizza your grand parents enjoyed. Having grown up next door to a Gino's pizza store family here in Phoenix I know everything about this pizza. I know the smells, the crust, the sauce, the cheese. I can't wait to scour their menu and go for the classics my family loved. It's my mom's birthday this weekend and will surprise my entire family. If you loved the Ginos in your neighborhood, Mill Ave, Scottsdale, Acadia in the 1960s make the drive and meet real Phoenix Pizza."}
{"text":"Only here by boat for 3 days, and had 2 meals from here. The pizza here is excellent, but the real secret is their Greek food offerings ... outstanding!  It's owner and family operated, and obviously use quality ingredients made fresh, daily ... you can taste it!   If I lived nearby, I would be here every week; they have a great menu!"}
{"text":"Ordered a pepperoni pizza from Gino's last night and had Uber EATS deliver. The pizza was so insanely greasy my young daughters couldn't finish it without dabbing it with a napkin.   Not worth it and we won't be back."}

{"text":"Don't order from Gino's Pizza, they failed to deliver the right order to my home did nothing to correct it, food tastes crappy since the change from Panzerrotto Pizza. They fail at quality of food AND customer service, FAIL!"}
{"text":"When i was a kid i used to come here and it was my favorite pizza place to go to. Prices were decent and I was pretty much their first customer when they first opened back in early 2000s. Recently i had a chance of stopping by this location and I was disappointed. What happened?! I ordered a Hawaiian Slice and it tasted... not as I had 4 years back. The crust tasted really old and overall it was REALLY BAD! Customer Service was horrible too. The minute i walked in the employee was talking on the phone and her clearly saw me come in and I waited I had to wait 5 minutes for him to take my order. Never coming here again! Childhood ruined forever. Bad Pizza, horrible service."}
{"text":"Came in on a Wednesday evening. Service was pretty slow because there was only one person working. Employee was polite and pizza was average."}
{"text":"Good Pizza and Wings. The food was delivered quick and it was piping hot!"}
{"text":"I've never experienced such poor customer service. A grown man (who I assume owns the place but may just work there) actually yelled profanities (ie. f bomb) in my face. This man could have been my father so I was extremely offended by not only his choice of words but his tone of voice.  I will never return to this establishment ever again."}
{"text":"This place has been here a long time so as longtime residents of the area we finally decided to try it. We were pleasantly surprised as the pizza was very good. Many toppings to choose from and some unique pizza combinations."}
{"text":"From what I rememeber, the Pizza was edible if not mindlbowing and the delivery was prompt. I'll rerate when I order it again."}
{"text":"So, I've ordered from Gino's many times, and generally have no complaints about the product. Great prices, great food, and pretty efficient service when ordering.  I ordered from their Queen/Torbram location not too long ago, and didn't have the best experience. When placing the order, the guy taking the call sounded annoyed, just kept trying to rush to end the call before I was even finished placing the order, didn't ask the method of payment, and hung up before I could even let him know that it was a credit card purchase. Oh well.  Once the driver arrived, he not only forgot parts of the order, but also got all pissed when my friend and I let him know it was meant to be a credit card purchase but were hung up on. Anyway, we rounded up some cash and got him out of there. After calling the store to complain, it turned out that the pissy call-taker and pissy driver were one and the same (what a tweest!), and there had been other complaints about him from other customers. The customer service guy was very apologetic and resolute, and made it up to us. Nice guy.  I won't condemn Gino's for having one bad apple (who has hopefully been canned since), and they haven't lost my business."}

{"text":"Not really that great. Sub par pizza. The people are nice but the place is dirty and not worth the money."}
{"text":"Good pizza nice staff but they move at  a snails pace.Unless you're getting slices expect to wait 30+ minutes for pickup. I could only imagine delivery!"}

{"text":"Didn't feel like cooking tonight, so took a walk up the street to get some pizza. It was a toss up between pizza pizza and Gino's pizza as they are very near to each other. I haven't tried Gino's before and I figure the quality had to be better so off I went.  Ordered 2 medium pizzas;   * red pepper, broccoli, feta, fresh garlic, extra sauce * pepperoni, red onions, green pepper, well done  Honestly, first bite, kind of disappointed. Someone else mentioned their pizza was bland, and I have to say, with all the flavours the toppings should bring out - the pizza was hella bland.  First of all- this is a big no no for me --- the Feta was shredded (why would you ever!)... And had no flavour..  The marina sauce base on the pizza taste like the \"pizza sauce\" in a yellow can from no frills- no flavour. Also too sweet for my personal liking.  The rest of the toppings were fresh, though.   I have to complain about the dipping sauce selection at Gino's, I think they had 4 or 5 options- seriously lacking. I was almost tempted to stop at pizza pizza to buy their garlic sauce *mmm*   Anyways, this is just an average pizza place, nothing epic to write home about. I would like to try other foods than pizza from here.. Eventually."}
{"text":"This is a review for the Yonge/St. Claire location. We ordered over the phone for pick up. The phone operator had a thick accent but was nice and helpful. Gave us a 15 minute time frame. We went to pick up and they said that the pizza would be done in 10 minutes..eh..annoying but okay whatever. When we came back one of the two pizza's was made with the wrong toppings. When we informed the staff they offered more soda for free to just take the incorrect pizza. Unfortunately we didn't like the toppings... When asked to make the pizza correctly they seemed irritated and stated they were very busy. Either way we got the correct pizza's 15 more minutes later...As far as the actual pizza goes...its not impressive. I understand things can't always go perfectly and appreciated the soda offer...just a little annoying to have to deal with for low quality pizza."}
{"text":"Probably the worst burger I've eaten in Toronto to date. If you've come here to decide whether or not to eat this food, please take this as your only warning. There isn't one good thing I could say about this restaurant. The prices are great!!!...... but it's not worth your money. The menu was lacking, and the food wasn't edible. Let's start with the burger, which was supposed to have bacon. It has pizza bacon, which is disgusting, even on pizza. Pizza bacon is comparable to dog food, which is more than I can say for the \"beef\" patty, which tastes nothing like beef. I could not eat the mystery meat.  The lettuce was a single piece of old, spoiled lettuce. I wouldn't be surprised if it was the last piece they had as it looks beaten to a pulp, then dipped in a vat of mystery sauce... The cheddar cheese was not covering the whole burger and it was also off-tasting, which paired well with the stale, cold bun.  The fries were also quite inedible. They were cold and old, and quite stale, without any salt, pepper, or effort. I also ordered gravy, which upon arrival seemed like it had just been taken out of the fridge. I microwaved, at which point it separated, also showing its age. I decided to order two bottles of pop and a lava cake in order to make the delivery minimum, and they failed to deliver one of the bottles. The lava cake, was frozen. This really confused me, as it's supposed to be a lava cake. If you've ever been to Domino's, this is exact opposite of what you should expect from a lava cake. It was a glorified two-bite brownie that was freshly de-thawed on its way to my home. I can honestly say this is the only time I've wanted to flag a place for such bad food, if I could give the establishment no stars I would. I pity anyone tries the food of this place. Please avoid at all costs, it's just not worth it."}
{"text":"So over the phone the lady was a bit rude. But in person she is much nicer. As far as dining here you have to be ready for the swamp cooler there is no AC.   As far as the take out I would recommend calling ahead. Every pizza is made to order so it takes a bit. It's thin crust so it's not like 45 min but more like 20 min.   The pizza well is okay. As many times as I have been here and having grown up in South Phoenix still not a huge fan. But the family seems to stand by them so I suppose the pizza is adequate.   The reason for 3 stars is my experience over the phone, swamp cooler, and adequate pizza."}
{"text":"Ordered an extra-large gluten-free pizza through JustEat. Gino's sent us a 'normal' crust (I tested it by taking a little bite).  So, we phoned Gino's, and the guy who answered said that they only make gluten-free crusts in medium, so he deliberately went ahead and made an extra-large normal pizza... which my guest couldn't eat.   I mean, why else would we ever order gluten-free, right?   Incredibly, this Gino's employee aggressively and repeatedly insisted on the phone that \"this is your fault, not mine,\" declining to refund our $24.54. (He did phone earlier, you see, and even let it ring a few times, but didn't leave voice mail - the obvious next step being, send a gluten-crust to someone who specifically asked for the opposite).   Anyway, now we're talking with JustEat, who are being much nicer than the angry guy who knowingly chose to make us the wrong pizza.   JustEat says we're getting our money back after all. And Gino's is sending their driver to take their pizza back..."}
{"text":"Some really great places to eat in South Phoenix. This is not one of them. The pizza is terrible - somewhere between a two day old Tombstone left in the sun and a slice of toasted bread with ketchup and imitation cheese slopped on it. Also, no air conditioning in Phoenix in August. How is this not a health code violation? Oh yeah, the one they have posted is expired. For fun, step out the back door and watch the pimps slap their girls around. I agree with the other posters on one thing though. The owner has a pretty cool car."}
{"text":"Gino's Pizza is one of those places I have growing up as a kid. Living in the ghetto south Phoenix neighborhood in which it is located, my parents frequently ordered delivery from this place. Now that I am a grown up, I still love it. It is just as good as I remember. I take a drive down once a month from north Phoenix.  Now keep in mind. I am praising them for their namesake... PIZZA. Anything else ... such as wings... is not so good.   Even so... I think Gino's is one of those \"Love it or hate it\" things. My stepdad says it tastes like a tortilla with ketchup on it. I say, cardboard never tasted so good!"}
{"text":"This review is for wing machine, and since there are no separate reviews for it, and ginos pizza is affiliated with it, sorry but I am never coming here again. I ordered a pound wings and wedges on the side. My whole order was wrong!!! The guy probably misheard me and gave me veggies instead... and I asked for some sauce put on the wings, and well... I got no sauce. Just plain buffalo wings. Like if you are confused or don't remember the order, just ask! And it's my fault for not realizing it until I got home because I was in a rush... the wing machine at yonge and eglinton is way better but I don't work around that area anymore :/"}
{"text":"There's not very much to say about this place. As far as downtown Toronto Pizza places, this place is better than pizza pizza (which is little better than cheese covered cardboard) but doesn't match up to Mamma's Pizza or some smaller place. I had a veggie slice here, the crust wasn't very good, the ingredients seemed ok, but I didn't really care for the overall taste, or texture."}
{"text":"Just another pizza place. Their slices are expensive than your other pizza places. You should got try another place where you can sit at least. This is a take out place only.  Actually go to Little Ceasars instead. It's in the same plaza."}
{"text":"I have a friend who lives in Chazy and we get Gino's whenever I visit. It's INCREDIBLE. I've tried a couple different kinds and there's no disappointing. Definitely the best place to go in the middle of nowhere that they call New York!"}
{"text":"Two hours and counting. We were excited to try a new pizza place, but I still haven't gotten my food. Oh well. I had better get my money back."}
{"text":"This place is horrible! The pizza and wings were disgusting! We placed a large order for a party and everyone said how disgusting everything was and we threw it all in the trash. We were so embarrassed to have brought this horrific food! The pizza was below cafeteria/frozen quality with bad crust and cheap ingredients. There was no flavor to the sauce. The wings were beyond disgusting consisting of about 80% fat. They were not edible. Unfortunately we had picked up 2 large pizzas and 3 orders of wings. It was very expensive for such low quality! Ugh! We know what good pizza and wings are and this is the bottom of barrel! For the record, these comments came from about 10 of our party guests. The kids would not even eat it!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"SO and I went for a road trip! Rouses Point is short drive from St.Albans but long enough that I haven't been here since I was little. After reading the reviews for the places to eat in town, we settle on Gino's.   We arrive to a almost full parking lot. We head inside to place our order, a large pizza and a order of poutine. 30 minute wait. That is fine and we head out to continue our drive, 15 minutes down the road (it was beautiful!) and 15 back. Foods still not ready and we are told 10 more minutes. We get back in the car head back over the bridge and get drinks, head back to wait.   I take a spot outside with the maybe 10 folks chilling with a few dogs and some kids. It's a nice picnic area, very clean and well cared for.     Our pizza and poutine comes out it looks delicious! Being so close to the border I had my fingers crossed for some authentic cheese curd poutine, I was a little disappointed that they used mozzarella shredded cheese. I have discovered that it's really rare to come across real cheese curd poutine. The crust for the pizza was \"meh\" and the cheese wouldn't stay on the crust. My boyfriend informed me this was because they use a \"circular method\" for applying cheese. They add a lot in the middle of the pie and then work outwards using less cheese and not work it up to the crust when the sauce isn't. The cheese would stay on much better with even distribution up to the part of crust that has no sauce.   I got a black cherry creemee. I asked for it to have a vanilla/black cherry swirl but that didn't happen. Sadness. My boyfriend got a root beer float, nothing special about it. He said \"It was a float.\"   The cashier seemed slightly agitated and I wouldn't have been surprised if I saw her roll her eyes, but she remained polite and was fairly formal. The girl at the creemee stand didn't have any personality and was just meh. The boy that was cleaning the picnic tables didn't speak much, but was nice when I was throwing out our plates and I asked if they had recycling inside for a bottle, he gladly brought that inside for me."}
{"text":"I went to the Gino's pizza on Bloor (and Bathurst) but since that location doesn't have a review page, this college st. locations gonna have to take the heat.  I don't feel guilty because one reviewer has already called you a \"disgrace to little Italy.\"  I mean, wow, what have you done to that person??!!  My white friend and I walked into Gino's Pizza but the welcome mat said Panzerotto's pizza???? I ordered a hawaiian panzerotto with garlic dipping sauce.  The dipping sauce said Gino's pizza on it, but the food's paper bag said Panzerotto's Pizza.???? I don't understand why they can't decide which pizza place they want to be!!    The panzerotti was insanely hot.  My Caucasian friend ordered a cheese panzerotti and is now recovering from a second degree burn to the chin.  I suffered a much crueler fate; I burned my taste buds. I can't taste anything!  I felt a massive wave of the itis following this meal; it was so greasy. .The napkins were next to the EMPTY tip cup.  Tip cup for takeout? Naw naw... I'm gonna have to save up my change for some taste bud replacement surgery.  Gino/Panzerotto, you don't give a DAMN about my taste buds or my white friend's chin!!"}
{"text":"I went her in the evening cuz I saw a burger and pop for $5.  I went in and saw 12-15 chicken wings sitting on display on a hot plate. They looked sooo dehydrated! I was like, \"Can someone get these wings some evian asap?!\" Then I walked the fudge out.  It's just cuz, if THATs how u treat your DISPLAY food, I don't wanna find out what's happening to my burger in the back.  I might come back on a night when I'm intoxicated by accident. Maybe their delivery is much better, who knows. Actually, there are so many pizza places in this area, I can't justify going back to Ginos. No thanks. Two disappointed Stars."}
{"text":"We ordered veggie pizza for dinner tonight and the pizza tasted very bad. I really wanted to like the pizza but unfortunately the quality was so not fresh and tasted bad. The guy who picked up the phone knew nothing about the pizza deals they offer and we ended up paying more money. I asked for whole wheat pizza which they didn't have either. Only good thing was fast Delivery. Never ordering from here again. I would not recommend this pizza to anyone."}
{"text":"So on the way to do a night timeline at south mountain. Stopped in to get some pizza. Wow Tony's frozen pizza would be better. Like really is awful. It's the most gehetto run down hole in the wall place that you would expect to have the most amazing food but nope. My 6 year old who will eat pizza every night took a bite and decided no dinner was a better option. I'm all about local places. But couldn't pay me to go here again. I wish I could get my 14$ back ew. We left the whole pizza laying on the table and left."}
{"text":"I placed my order online- They didn't have an option for fry or baked Panzo.. but they did for the wings. the store didn't call or email me asking for my option. I assumed it would have been fried but it was baked. I called Customer Service and they told me NOTHING can be done. I feel that is HORRIBLE customer service. I will definitely NOT be purchasing from Ginos's pizza ever again! We threw it out- what a WASTE of my hard earned money!"}
{"text":"Horrid. This place was indescribable. I have never been so disrespected in my entire life. The owner actually yelled at me and my (female!) friends from inside the restaurant! Ridiculous! I will NEVER again get pizza from this place. If you would have seen how these people reacted, you wouldn't either! Please, buy your food elsewhere. Do NOT give these people your business!!!!"}
{"text":"Not another bland, sparse grease wheel. I needed a pizza badly, but couldn't drive up to Lemar's in Bradford. Gino's was too conveniently close, and I needed food now!  I walked into the new, clean storefront and ordered a medium thin crust, with pepperoni, mushroom, bacon crumble, ham and extra cheese for take out. I asked the price, and found out I was south of 12 bucks, so I added mild sausage. It was a struggle, but I actually got the price up to $13.50.  With tax!  15 minutes later, I left with my prize--an unusually heavy pizza box. This pizza was almost an inch high!  Note that it was a thin crust. Incidentally, the crust was as crisp as a cracker.  The toppings were more than abundant, fresh and tasty.  In essence, I wound up with a \"low carb\" pizza that would make Dr. Atkins proud.   With this amount of toppings, it was a bit drippy, but that's half the fun!"}
{"text":"Please save your money and time and DON'T order from this place!!  I ordered almost $70 worth of food and it took them 2 hours to deliver it. After the first hour, i called and was told that my food was on the way and had just left. An hour later there was still no food. I called again and the employee who answered the phone was extremely rude. He said \"Well its Saturday and we are busy\". I understand that weekends are busy but then they shouldnt have said my food would only be 40 minutes. When the food finally came it was cold and TERRIBLE. I called to speak with a manager and for 2 days in a row they told me he wasnt there. Finally i got in touch with someone and they were just as rude. He said \"The best i can do for you is give yiu $10 off of your next order.\" I explained to him that i would NEVER be ordering from them again. So his response was \"Well then i dont need to do anything for yo.\" And hung up. Never had such bad food or service in my life."}
{"text":"Decent enough for chain pizza and even though it's hardly my first choice, I'm sure I'll have it again at some point when I get tired of my usual rotation and feel like throwing something new into the mix every now and then.  Generally speaking the price is right...they have a three topping, two pop and dip special that's the same price as Pizza Pizza and I prefer Gino's pizza to that of the big double P. The dipping sauce doesn't compare but obviously that's a given. Plus if you want a good walk in special, I think they have a large three topping for only $10.99, pop and dip extra. A pretty good deal but again I think it's walk-in only and I don't have the patience to wait around for twenty minutes...I don't how and why so many people do. The number of folks I see just walking in and placing their pizza orders on the spot always baffles me. Don't you own a phone or have better things to do than loiter around while your pie is made? I don't get it.  So yeah, it's about average and it's probably a two and half star place that I'll bump up because of friendly service and good prices. But I do sort of share Tasha's view that the place is, well, sort of dirty. You'd think that would bother me more but I guess my love of pizza outweighs any concerns over the cleanliness of the establishment. Yikes, what does that say about me?"}
{"text":"As a New Yorker, I find it very hard to find good pizza when I travel.  Most are truly disappointing.  However, I couldn't be happier with Gino's.  The pizza is excellent.  The sauce was good and the cheese they use is great...none of that money saving, flavorless, flimsy stuff other pizza places use.  Even though the crust on a pizza isn't my favorite part, I actually loved theirs.  To top things off, the business, which is a long-lived business, is family owned and run and they are more than welcoming and friendly and treat customers like part of the family.  It's nice to know there's a place up here that can really do pizza!  Oh...btw...they've got some great Mediterranean treats occasionally, so you always have to keep you radar on."}
{"text":"I want to love Gino's, and for the most part I do, but it isn't unconditional. The calzones are good, the rest of the food is fine. The dining area is small but it is clean and comfortable, and the people running the indoors area are fine and dandy. Here is my gripe, and if you wanna call me a piss-ant, well, fine. WHY can they not make a soft serve sundae with flavored soft serve? Is there some creamie coalition or some creamie contract that they signed with the devil that prohibits the application of hot fudge to a peppermint flavored dish of soft serve ice cream? Is there something in the aforementioned artificially flavored ice cream that will turn me into a purple newt if I eat it WITH sundae toppings? Maybe I want to be a newt, did you think of that? Unlike the dudes that work indoors, the ice cream social ladies can sometimes be not too social..perhaps a little...cold? It is their business, so I guess they have to do what they have to do...and I'll still go...but be warned, ice cream ladies...I might be a little frosty with my orders.   Funny review fail."}
{"text":"When we first moved to the area we would have friends over and order pizza from Gino's every weekend. They had a walk-in special; an extra large one topping and a dipping sauce for $9.99.   I started having issues after we switched out our regular order of pepperoni for extra cheese instead, or sometimes double cheese (by paying for another topping). I mean, they were always a bit skimpy on the cheese, but to order extra, or pay for double, and get the same amount is not right.   This happened quite a few times, so I decided to mention it the next time I called and put in an order. I told the lady taking the order to please note we have not been receiving enough cheese on our last few cheese pizzas. As in you could still see sauce everywhere. She said if we are ever not satisfied, we need to call and complain right away. We picked up our pizza, and AGAIN, the cheese was non existent. My boyfriend was hungry so he grabbed a slice while I called the customer service line.   Once I got through, I explained what had happened and the lady asked if any of the pizza had been eaten. I said one slice was missing because we were hungry and she said: \"Sorry ma'am, we will only replace a pizza if none has been eaten, so the only thing I can do is put in a complaint to head office, if you like.\" I said yes, and we never ordered anything from Gino's again.   After almost a year of ordering from the same place, they lost a weekly customer over a bit of cheese. If you are looking for chain pizza, Dominos has much better food, and much better customer service."}
{"text":"The pizza is absoutly terrible...In fact i find it offensive that they are even legally allowed to call it \"pizza\".  The staff is rude at best. The interior is somewhat halfassed and dirty looking without any sort decor at all.  They have had old ovens, and other used kitchen equipment sitting in the \"dining area\" for months now just collecting dust and who knows what else. Here is the ginos recipe: cheapiest \"cheese food product\" available Tomato paste as a sauce Cardardboard crust that is also still somehow uncooked in the middle. Add canned topings as needed.   I\"ve tried them multiple times and each experience is worse than the last. Normally diarrhea ensues shortly after.  Do yourself a favor and go to the nearest gas station, they will have better pizza there..."}
{"text":"I think this is the best local pizza in South Phoenix.. got the thin crust and lots of toppings.  The staff is awesome and i have never been disappointed in their Pizza. In fact Im going tonite to get some."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with this place. I was very excited to eat at a place local South-siders recommended. But my family and I were greatly let down.  First, after we got over the hot room with only a swamp cooler, the service was beyond horrible. Never got a hello but got a what do you want. When our food was brought out, it was thrown on the table with a \"watch it, this is hot.\" A side tip, don't ask for crushed pepper, that will just make the lady even more mad.  The food was something else. After seeing everything was frozen and in cans, I was shocked by the price of the pizza. The crust was like cardboard and the sauce was nothing special. Honestly, little Caesar's would have been better.  Save your money or go someplace else!"}
{"text":"Halal Meat is served here. Ordered some take-out pizza + chicken wings today. Got the halal pepperoni and halal chicken pizzas. Both were good, but halal chicken pizza was better. The chicken wings were excellent. Had the Buffalo sauce with honey. Friendly service."}
{"text":"You should never expect anything from pizza slice joints but a way to fill that howling void that is your stomach. Mostly it's really hard to do that poorly, but I can say with confidence that this particular establishment has failed me on multiple occasions. Something in the construction of their pie makes it more than bland, resulting in something slightly worse than Ontario's Favorite Cardboard (Pizza Pizza for the layman)."}
{"text":"I ordered a pesto Italiano pizza from them 2018, 03, 29. I was made aware that they were out of artichokes (again, they're always out of some thing when I order). I timed them and they called about that 3 minutes before they were supposed to deliver the pizza. It took an hour to get pizza to my house which is less then 30 minutes away. I ordered online, I selected the things I wanted and didn't want on my pizza. But the pizza came as it was described, with every thing I didn't want. I also added chicken which didn't come with the pizza either but I was charged for chicken and artichokes on the order.  I also ordered the bruschetta bread which was nothing more then garlic toast with tomatoes and cheese on top. When the driver finally arrived (and I'm not sure if he was being honest about this), he said the debit card machine wasn't working. So I payed for extra toppings AND a dollar extra to pay with debit (which he probably gets as a tip.....WTF). The whole think lead to a fight with my husband on a holiday weekend... NOT COOL.  I wouldn't even give this place half a star if I could. I'm so pissed that I want a refund."}
{"text":"It's not the pizza of the gods, but it's a pretty good pizza! Their regular crust is a bit on the thin side, and nicely chewy. I particularly like the tomato sauce they use as it focuses on savoury instead of sweet. If you only choose a few toppings the pepperoni gets a little crispy on the edges. I haven't noticed any \"skimping on the cheese\" and it's always seemed like enough to me. Their pizzas tend to feel more 'steamy' on the bottom compared to other establishments, but it's not an oil spill so it's fine.  This is my go to local pizza place, by the way!"}
{"text":"Wow, just tried to order food. They say they deliver til close! Don't ever order from here. I called to place an order hour before they close, hear in the background while on the phone. (Explicit are you kidding me)!  Well I didn't realize I was disturbing you!"}
{"text":"The pizza was mediocre as was the cheesecake. The chicken tenders were good too. The delivery took a little while. Eh."}
{"text":"Ordering food when you're extremely hungry is as much of a mistake as going to the supermarket when under the same duress. No good can come from it.   But that's the situation I found myself in tonight as I rifled through my pile of food flyers and found a menu for Gino's.   Now, I should clarify, I've had pizza from this exact location before and it was pretty good, but it was slice pizza, the ones they sell individually over the counter. The ones they put more cheese and toppings on. So it's a mislead. Which should have warned me to be more careful when choosing them tonight. But I was, as previously stated, extremely hungry, and thus not thinking clearly.  I don't like Pizza Pizza and this was in line to what I'd expect from that chain. I ordered the 3 larges with two toppings each and a 2L soda special, thinking I'd eat then have the rest for leftover lunches.   One pie was missing a topping I'd ordered. The others had barely enough toppings to cover the pies middle let alone the entire pizza.   I ate the food and didn't call to complain as I was so hungry and wasn't going to wait for a replacement, and part of the low amount of stars here was due to me just not liking the quality of the pizza itself, but I probably won't order here again. Wasn't horrible, just wasn't good, and for $15 a Pizza, I expect more."}
{"text":"This place has so much potential but I have no idea why they ALWAYS make their pizzas so doughy. Always taste undercooked and just weird. Even when I ask for well done, thin crust - something just tastes odd about their dough. Not sure if someone out there knows what I'm talking about but all my friends agree!"}
{"text":"We went to Gino's Pizza for some above par Pizza for a great price. My very first experience was in Guelph and was a great drunk food to consume. This Gino's has been around for months now and the guy taking my order (not sure if he's the owner) really was up selling hard. Kinda annoying, but the pizza was good. It's by my place so I'll be back! Jimstar out!"}
{"text":"Grabbed a cheese slice from the sidewalk case while at a show at The Rex last week and was shocked at how good it was! I don't know why it took me so long to try Gino's, but I will get a slice every time from now on!"}
{"text":"We have been trying new pizza places recently and decided to give Gino's a go since we somehow received a flyer from them with some pretty good coupons. Everything is great! We ordered wings, pizza and a hoagie and everything was definitely above average. I'm over the commercialized pizza that places like Pizza Hut and Dominos offer and this was nothing like that. Another positive was the fact that when the food was delivered it was still hot (and even steaming)! They have a great menu selection as well. We will definitely be ordering again."}
{"text":"After I moved to North York in 2011, I had seen a lot of restaurants and take-out places I wanted to try.  Truth be told, driving through the Bathurst and Steeles intersection, I always wanted to try Gino's Pizza.  It was on the corner, the yellow sign was inviting and it had a joint place with Wing Machine.  I know, right?  Living in Waterloo during my university days at Laurier over a decade ago, I always ordered a pie from Gino's Pizza.  From what I could remember, It was a fantastic pizza and it tasted absolutely delicious.  I wanted to rekindle that experience again now in Toronto.  Our allegiance is to the mighty Domino's Pizza but hey, gotta check out the alternatives, eh?  When we entered there was a worker waiting for business.  We checked out the flyer menu and there was a special.  1 Large pizza with 3 toppings, 1 sauce and 2 cans of pop for $13.99.  Not too shabby!  We jumped on it and ordered a \"Royal\" Pizza (pepperoni, green peppers and mushrooms), Garlic Parmesan Sauce and 2 Schweppes Ginger Ale.  When he cashed us out he said that it was cash only.  Ummm... there is an Interac sign on the door.  He said the machine was broken.  Oookay.  So we paid cash.  He said it would be about 10 minutes.  Pizza came out in time, got the sauce and pop.  The worker was smiley and nice and wished us on our way.  Got to our dinner table, I opened the box and looked in.  Kinda flat pizza and the toppings were neat and not loaded.  I took a slice and it the crust looked chewy.  I took a bite... blahhh... boring!  The crust tasted a bit undercooked and the pizza was not great tasting.  Geez, even 241 is better than this place.  I was not impressed at all.  However, what was amazing was the GARLIC PARMESAN sauce.  When I dunked the pizza in, it enhanced the flavour 10 times.  It was a little bit more enjoyable after that.  Well, my Waterloo Gino's taste has been shattered.  I am probably not going to go here again and just stick to my Domino's loyalty.  The Gar Par sauce was fabulous to kick the taste of the totally blah pizza.  I had to try it out and I am happy that I did so I don't keep on wondering.  Unfortunately, I couldn't rekindle with Mr Gino.  2 stars only!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place with great neighborhood guys baking and serving. Love you guys!"}
{"text":"Great lunch place. We had a slice of meat lovers pizza, a meatball sub, and a chicken cordon bleu sub. They were all great. The pizza was crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. Everything was cooked in the pizza oven."}
{"text":"This place is the epidemy of yuck. STALE cracker like crust with dollor store cheese and pepperoni. They had the nerve to ask for their tip. Never again... I'm calling after writing this review"}
{"text":"I made the mistake of ordering one of Gino's specials on Grubhub. They ran out of the pizza I ordered and substituted a significantly cheaper option instead. The delivery driver got lost and, when the food finally arrived, the side included with the special was nowhere to be found.  I called the store to see if they could finish the order or refund the price difference, but manager argued with me on the phone for several minutes about this and flat out refused to do so. Thankfully, Grubhub was a joy to speak to. +1 for Grubhub, -1 for Gino's.  Oh, the food? Decent, but nothing special. Order from somewhere else and save yourself the hassle."}
{"text":"Good pizza and nice people. We drove out if our way to try this place. We will return."}
{"text":"This is quick slice pizza. Period.  I grabbed a slice in between sets at The Rex next door. It fit my need. It was cheesy, tasty and large. I was happy. There were lots of other items on the menu but I didn't have time to try anything else. But if they were as good as the crust on the Pizza they'd probably be pretty good. I usually don't eat the crust, but this crust was good. To bad they weren't open after the show. I wanted another slice."}
{"text":"Today's lunch was edible, but it certainly wasn't great pizza by any means. However, when the employer orders lunch delivered - that's the only thing that matters.   The pizza came in three different varieties and I samples each of them - all were ok. They delivered on time, they were all very warm and each was about as good as the next. They were cooked nicely and the flavor was ok.   This review is based only on delivery and I have no clue how the place is for cleanliness, friendliness or the parking situation. But remember - this is a basic pizza place that delivers - certainly not over the top with anything, but I seriously wouldn't give it one star.   I guess some folks have just been very lucky with pizza joints as this one was by far was NOT the worst I've had."}
{"text":"It is the cheapest pizza out of all the major companies, and it's quite delicious. 10.99 gets you a 3 topping pizza, with 2 pops and 1 dip. You can't beat that anywhere. And not to mention, the delivery is FREE and you only need a $10 minimum order where most places are $15 and up."}
{"text":"Great pizza and great delivery service! Our delivery man was extremely parient and kind as i was trying to calm my puppy and pay for the food. I will definitely be ordering again :)"}
{"text":"Terrible. Been over two hours and we live about 7 minutes from the place driving. Straight terrible. Junk. Unreal. Idk if I've said this but it's terrible."}
{"text":"Do not go here!!!! I was waiting for a ride in Port Credit and I thought I'd grab a quick bite to eat at Gino's Pizza. This experience was a total nightmare, it just kept getting worse and worse. I saw a sign for 2 slices for $5 and went inside. It looked kind of scuzzy but they served pizza and beer, two staples in my diet. I ordered a slice of Pepperoni and a slice with pepperoni, mushrooms, and green peppers. I took a bite of the pepperoni and it tasted like cardboard. Completely tasteless, so I decided to eat the other one. It was bland but that's not the worst part. When I looked at the slice of pepperoni, there was a FLY IN IT. I was disgusted. I spent forever trying to get the attention of the staff (they were in the back talking, I was SCREAMING \"excuse me\", but they didn't seem to hear me). When he finally came over I let him know and he apologized and gave me another slice. Umm okay. That's disgusting. I sat back down and looked at the wall and there were dead flies all around the sign inside. Oh God. I didn't eat my second slice. I went to the bathroom which was decrepit at best. It was horrifyingly dirty, like everything else in this place. I refused to use it. I just left. To top it all off, when I went outside and around the corner (where my ride was waiting to get me) the neon sign was CAKED IN FLIES. Bleh! So unhygienic. This place cannot be up to code. It was absolutely horrendous. I spent rest of the night nursing my aching stomach. Will never return."}
{"text":"I complained recently that there were no local takeout pizza places nearby, to which several friends responded that I was nuts. \"Have you tried Gino's?!?!\" they asked..... I promised that I would get there ASAP and finally did so tonight. I had my in-laws over and we all agreed that it was generally very good. I don't know that I'm a fan of the crust, but there's not much of it and I am a fan of that. Plus, I was impressed to find tasty fresh red onions on our veggie pizza (weird that this simple ingredient is remarkable, but it was), and overall good toppings with slightly above average sauce. I vow to immediately stop ordering from the chain place around the corner unless I'm really desperate -- all future business goes to Gino's when I'm in the neighborhood and looking for takeout. And there's also a decent little area for dining in, including arcade, but who knows when we'll ever make the time to stay. Maybe if there's ever a band on the stage?"}
{"text":"This place got renovated some time ago. I've noticed this place for a long time as I used to always wait at the bus stop in front of the store for the 60 bus. Surprisingly, I never did get anything up until today.   Anyway first time coming here as I was lured by the coupon that I got in the mail. Got the $3 medium pizza. It's an OK pizza...Lacking a bit in cheese though. Dough was soft and chewy. Could have used some more time in the oven as I like my pizzas more well done."}
{"text":"Affordable pizza, quality slices, and pretty damn good strombolis. The guys that work the counter are friendly and make this place a viable option when it comes to craving pizza.  Unfortunately, though, I'd have to agree with Darren--it's time for new pizza recipes. We already have a huge pizza presence in South Side, and everyone makes pretty much the same pizza. After a night out on East Carson, however, it doesn't really matter how many of the same pizza joints are around, because they're all full, and all of them provide you with the same wonderful, hazy memory the next morning.  I'll miss Blue Grotto, but I also won't complain, because this place still satisfies."}
{"text":"Love there pizza as well as there chicken parm sub and fries ! Massimo and Cole are very nice delivery drivers ! Always great service here"}
{"text":"this is one of those places that people grew up eating in south phoenix  good or bad I definitely like a Ginos pizza every now and then and will make that drive or have someone coming my way pick me a couple up since im about 25 miles away. Price is as high as many but it is a tradition to many and once your hooked it a 2 pizza special time. Know Jack the owner for years and been eating this pizza for a long time now. Will be back again and again. Love it or hate ill be back for more ! Deluxe no bell pepper and a pepperoni / shrimp and its on !.."}
{"text":"this is my go to place for pizza.  always good and fresh ingredients.  owner is also very friendly. try the bacon pineapple pizza combo ...cant go wrong."}
{"text":"One of the best pizza places ever! Love the feel of the restaurant. Food is delicious and I kept going for seconds. This pizza beats all others. You need to try this place. I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Literally the worst customer service. I got a call when my food was supposed to be delivered telling me that there was no turkey (i ordered a turkey wrap and pepperoni rolls) and asked for a discount or something along those lines being it had been a awhile since i placed my order. I know grub hub isn't through their facility but still it was late and i was about to cancel all together. I was on the phone with a manager and he was very rude in the fact that he would not let me get a word in at all. He talked over me consistently(yelling). I work in the industry and i know how it goes. Also it was delivered an hour after expected.. the actual delivery service was good i will say. But i have this place another try and and failed again. Sorry to say"}
{"text":"Went in not expecting much. Just wanted a slice of pizza. Looks like it is run my a husband/wife combo. I was the only one there. They will a little quiet but very friendly. I asked if they could put a bit more tomato sauce on my slice and the just poured in on no extra charge! Gotta love that service!"}
{"text":"Great place for a pizza slice. This is one of the best places to get a pizza slice in Mississauga (always a large assortment of fresh slices on hand) I am not a fan of thicker sliced pizza, but always make an exception for this place. Turnaround is fast so you always get a fresh tasting slice and they never skimp on the toppings. A true 4 star pizza slice!"}
{"text":"Good place, food was good owner was very personable and funny. Ice cream was great also and reasonable prices. I would go back again. Beautiful views of the water and dog friendly picnic tables outside the store in a permanent covered structure and nice place in the back to walk your dog if needed."}
{"text":"Don't make the mistake of dropping in here for a quick slice at lunch.  Today I dropped by because I was craving pizza and was nowhere close to Pizza Pizza. Walked in to a single employee sweeping the floor. Thats cool, making use of downtime, I get it.   She quickly walked to the back to wash her hands, but I use \"wash\" loosely. It was a brief run under water, no soap involved.   So, I think \"OK, she'll be putting gloves on\" NOPE.  Then I figure, \"its okay, she won't be touching my pizza at all\" NOPE. She went after my chosen slice with both paddle and fingers.  Not wanting to make a fuss, stupidly, I'm deciding I will avoid the crust that she touched all over. NOPE.  As it was coming out of the oven, she decided to test the heat of the underside of my slice by placing all of her hand there. As it was apparently heated to her liking, she dropped it in a box and handed it over.  I must add that, this employee was wearing the dirtiest, and I mean dirtiest, apron I have ever seen. Pizza sauce and bits of crust everywhere, I shudder to think what else.  Unacceptable in every way possible. It is my own fault, I should have chosen Subway.  Do not eat here."}
{"text":"have been eating Gino's pizza for the last 30 years and they  have the same great tasting pizza.  natural pizza, not all the fancy stuff, something your Italian grandma would make.  Slicers, Spinatos,Paleremos cannot come close to the authentic taste of Gino's pizza.  Just sayin!"}
{"text":"As I was waiting for a bus to work one morning last week, a college-aged fellow handed me a menu for a new pizza parlor named Gino's, one that occupies the same spot the since-moved (but still in South Side) Carson Street Deli once stood.  And as can be guessed, the pizza (ours was called the South Side Buster and contained double pepperoni, double mozzarella, and romano) was a typical 'Burgh pie in that it was doughy and thick. It's not that I dislike this manner of pizza, but I've had it at entirely too many restaurants around the city. It's time to do something different, paisanos. I also (but should have known better) didn't appreciate the mediocre Oreo cheesecake or the hour-plus wait for food. If we were too far away or inclement weather made travel difficult, I would have understood if Gino's had declined our request, but they must have wanted our business badly enough.   However, salvaging our delivered dinner was something called Rifka. Under a sesame seed bun sat pastrami, mayonnaise, ketchup, sliced (!) hot dogs, tomato, lettuce, and dill pickle. Fried jumbo was what immediately and pleasurably came to mind, this risk-taker of a sandwich excelling on all fronts.   Otherwise, it's time for new pizza recipes. There are too many pizza-makers doing the same thing around these parts, and from the looks of it, they might as well be considered pop-ups, 'cause they ain't lastin' long."}
{"text":"Ginos is the BOMB! I've been eating here since I was little and till this day. I always order my pizza over the phone and there very pleasant to speak to. I definitely would suggest getting a pepperoni pizza and make it crispy!"}
{"text":"Called in for Delivery the first time and \"WOW\"!!! Haven't eaten a Good Delivery Pizza in a Long Time. Will call in again when we decide on Pizza."}
{"text":"This is my go-to pick up pizza place since it is located close to my home. The pizzas are good and the staff friendly.  My order is typically thin crust and well done and they do it well."}
{"text":"My experiences with this Gino's have been both late-night eats, and lazy delivery days. Every time I've gotten decent pizza for decent prices, and good service, so I really can't complain. Obviously I've had better pizza at better places, but convenience-wise, Gino's takes the cake.  As for their wings...no. Just no. I' m a fan of crispy wings, and these ones were so slimy I immediately regretted ever having a craving. Everything else in their \"deals\" section is reasonable, and you can check it all out online so you don't have to listen to a recording over the phone for 20 minutes. Delivery comes within the hour, so not bad at all."}
{"text":"We always order from this Gino's when we order for work functions. The couple who own it have been here a long time and they make it better than any other franchise location (Gino's or others) that I've been to.  Wish I lived closer do it could be more of a regular pickup."}
{"text":"My First Love!! Gino my love all I do is daydream about you out here in Charleston, SC!! I flew out to Phoenix last month just to have you in my mouth! Only if you delivered to the east coast, say you'll never change..I Love you! Your #1 Fan! =)"}
{"text":"Gino's pizza is a South -Siders MUST! I was raised in south Phoenix, this to me is comfort food. I love this place."}
{"text":"I always seem to come here for a slice when I am going to a show at The Rex. Never at any other time have I done so. The pizza isn't that good at all yet here I am, always hungry because I don't eat before leaving the house. This place is ok for making the growling in your stomach stop temporarily. Nothing more. Nothing less."}
{"text":"A great staple of the community, Gino's is a great place for pizza and ice cream!  Every time we head North we stop at Gino's.  Why? Butter pecan ice cream.  Prices are very reasonable for the quality of food and service you receive."}
{"text":"I was hungry and low on cash, so the walk-out deal advertised on the front of the restaurant was definitely a risk I was willing to take.  I didn't expect much for the price & location, but I was pleasantly surprised at how yummy the pizza was!  Hot, crispy, and cheesy!  When I was living in the neighborhood I ordered delivery and did pick-up several times and it was always good."}
{"text":"Walk-in special are really cheap.  The pizza is decent, better than other delivery places in the area.  I keep coming back for the chicken fingers & fries. Their fries are those coated ones and are SO GOOOOD.  And the chicken fingers are the good quality ones, not the weird cheap ones.  They give four or five fingers, fries, a can of pop, and a dip in the meal deal.  I've also had the burger a few times and it's fine.  I like grabbing either of these meals on the way home when I'm very tired, hungry, don't want to wait long for food, and can't be bothered to cook.   Guys at the counter are always friendly, fast, and well-informed.   I agree with others that the wings in the spinning display case looks weird though."}
{"text":"Terrible!  Ordered pepperoni pizza and wings ($25). Wings were fatty disgusting and soggy. Pizza was mediocre at best. I will never order from this place again. I have no idea how they are still in business."}
{"text":"I have actually never ordered an entire pizza and usually just quickly stop for a slice when I go here but I find somehow they are always fresh!! The crust is nice and thin ( but not too thin ) meanwhile the grease is not dripping off the slices."}
{"text":"It was late, I was drunk and hungry.  I gave the cashier too much money and he gave me my cash back and said I paid too much. He didn't have to do that so props to him.  Pizza was ok, it filled the void but it was also quite forgettable."}
