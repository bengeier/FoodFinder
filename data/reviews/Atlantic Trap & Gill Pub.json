{"text":"This place has awesome live music, and fun staff. Really love the new venue! It's huge! Nova Scotiables are awesome hosts of the open Mic as well. Loads of fun =}"}
{"text":"A rather large bar located on MacLeod Trail. This bar gets pluses for the live entertainment setup, and having space for a real dance floor so you can do an East coast jig.  Sure, there's Maritime and Newfoundland kitsch around the place, and donair meat and fried pepperoni on the menu, but this still doesn't make it transport you East like more intimate places such as Below Deck downtown.  A good spot for special days like St. Paddy's or Alexander Keith's Birthday when it's really buzzing, but not somewhere I'm itching to go regularly.  

P.S.  When the singer calls \"Sociable!\", you're suppose to clink glasses with people NOT at your table too!"}
{"text":"Well I've been here a few times so far; both on band nights and regular ones.

I must say I am fairly impressed with the food, possibly the best pub food I've had in Calgary and with good prices no less.

The beer was... meh. They need to clean the lines more often but still it was a good joint.

All of the staff were polite and informative - even charming at times... hahaha -  but seriously a good place to spend an evening. Besides, isn't partying with the eastern folks always a good time?"}
{"text":"I called at 2000hrs querying how late their kitchen is open 'til, as we wanted some 20 cent mussels. They said 2300hrs. We showed up at 2215hrs. There were 5 tables and three staffers. It took them 8 minutes to approach us. We told them we wanted mussels, the guy said they closed the kitchen at 10 \"because it wasn't busy fifteen minutes ago\". We get a jug of beer anyways. It's obvious they haven't cleaned the lines in a while, and no, it wasn't just the Keiths that was tasting bad. 

-3 stars for all the BS, but I will come back and give an honest review on their cheap mussels assuming they don't close the kitchen before it gets busy."}
{"text":"Us downhomers were eager for a night of squid-jiggin fun and were expecting this to be da place.When we walk in we were happy with the decor-bringing us to a down home feel eh,We had a couple beers as we were early for the live band.The real prob started when a pub-crawl crowd showed up and a couple were too drunk and dropping their drinks all over and can barely stand up-not impressed with barkeep as he did nothing but serve them more?When they finally left and the band started we were disappointed again as people were crammed to the gills and we couldnt see the band(which were terrible).So-we were not thrilled with this place..wont be back...."}
{"text":"If you are like me and are a maritimer who has transplanted themselves to Calgary, the Atlantic Trap & Gill Pub is a great place to make you feel like you are home again.  I mean after all, it says it right in the name!

There is nothing particularly special about the pub though. The only thing that distinguishes it from other pubs is that they have lots of fish netting and lobster traps hanging from the roofs.  Pretty stereotypical, but definitely enough for me. 

I would love to just clarify one thing though and this is specially for all the great bands that play at the Trap and Gill.  I get that you think Maritimers says SOCIABLE instead of cheers, but you know what?  We don't say it at the end of EVERY song.  I assume it is so we drink more, but it takes away the value of it, just a little bit. 

For any maritimer who might feel a little homesick, I'd suggest checking out my home away from home....literally."}
{"text":"Classic local pub, great staff, near perfect pints of Guiness, and live Irish folk music that sends the crowd dosie doh-ing till the early hours. 

Great for a daytime swifty and a game of flights or a friday night jig.

love it."}
{"text":"Great place to go if you love live music, great beer selection, amazing chicken wings. My server the few times I have been there chaylene is one of the best waitresses in the city!"}
{"text":"This place coasts by on the loneliness of East Coasters and a longing that some of them share to return to their supposed homes.

Not really my scene.  Kinda depressing."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying that the all-day happy hour pricing on Sundays and the service here are great. That being said, I came here for some East Coast food and I can't say I was overly impressed.

Being a Maritimer in Calgary, I'm always eager to have garlic fingers and Halifax-style donairs. So, I ordered both of these on this visit to the Atlantic Trap and Gill.

The garlic fingers came on a thin, almost crispy crust. Although the taste was good, with the gooey cheese and sharp garlic, they real should come on a puffy soft crust. The donair sauce had the sweet garlic flavour I'm accustomed to, but was too runny. A good donair sauce will stand up on its own.

As for the donairs, the toppings were \"correct\" (donair meat, tomatoes, and onions on a pita with donair sauce), but the meat was too thickly cut and inappropriately spicy. As well, and this is nit-picky I will admit, both the onions and tomatoes were thickly sliced then they really should be chopped.

For a place to go have a couple beers and some pub food close to home, this is a great choice. But, it's not going to fill the void of my fav East-coast dishes."}
{"text":"For a pub that is called the trap and gill they are surprisingly lacking in seafood options on the menu. The time I went there was no milk for our coffees and we're never told prior to ordering the coffee about this. 

The music that night (a father son duo that song Irish folk music) was exceptional and I really enjoyed how the stage is the centre piece of the place.

Edit: They might have less than a handful of seafood options on the menu, but they have an awesome deep fried Mars bar as a desert"}
{"text":"ITS A TRAAAAAAP!

Ok, well not like that. But it could be. Several years ago my friends and I would frequent \"The Trap\" on a fairly regular basis. It was always a great time. Since returning to the city I haven't been back on a weekend evening but during the week for lunch. 

I was doing some work in the hotel attached and came for lunch here two days in a row as the hotel gave myself and my coworkers a discount coupon. I don't remember what I had the first day, I think it was a burger. The second day though was all you can eat fish and chips. AYCE Fish is probably the only reason to come here for fish and chips. They're mediocre, but a good sized portion. The best part of the meal was the aioli that they serve with the sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"The Atlantic trapping Gil has done a wonderful job at listening to criticism and turning things around. They have even opened up their business to families and kids. Very impressive I can't wait to see what happens this summer."}
{"text":"The ambiance and the live band were very good...however, the food was almost horrible.   

The seafood chowder was good but was not \"Classic East Coast\" in anyway!  I'm from Nova Scotia and have lived in NB & PEI and have never, never had seafood chowder like that.   

The fish & chips were horrible.   Unseasoned and the batter was just flour and water.  Worse of all, the haddock was frozen and thawed in water - a health code violation by the way.  To top it all off, the coleslaw was tasteless.  Not what I expected from an East Coast themed pub.

My GF started with Nachos which had about 1/4 of the cheese it should have had.  

Then she had the steak sandwich.  The \"steak\" was poor quality and very thin.  It was unseasoned and the grill it was cooked hadn't been cleaned properly in at least a month...possibly longer.   The caesar salad side was ok, store bought dressing and not much of it, but ok.  

Our server did a great job and very friendly.  But our main course came out about 5 minutes after out appetizers, so our main's sat on the table as we finished the appetizers.  

I would go back for music and drinks but if the manager wants to improve,  my suggestion would be to replace the cooking staff...they should not be cooking as a profession."}
