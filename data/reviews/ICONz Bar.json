{"text":"Food sucks. Trouble quite frequent. Drugs and gunshots regular here. Cops called quite frequently. This place totally SUCKS"}
{"text":"This bar is awesome! This bar has a great atmosphere, amazing bartenders, and good food! I will definitely be back and would recommend iconZ to all my friends"}
{"text":"ignored the first 25 min...I times it...I tried to get attention but they were socializing then after I ordered they didn't want to pay me any mind so I just left and never got to order another drink.....terrible service."}
{"text":"Melissa is a great bar tender and is fun to be around but one thing she want put up with no crap love it"}
{"text":"Trashy! Distressed Building and interior. Clientele is mostly local restaurant workers and blue collar Gastonia dirt. Enough Cheep Beer and drinks to get you smashed but not worth the trouble that follows. Local police have been called there too many times for shooting, fights, drugs and more. Local Gym owner next door has to keep surveillance camera's up to protect her business from the drunks that stumble out of there past 2am. Make sure you have an arranged ride home because Gastonia, McAdenville, Lowell and Belmont Cops await anyone willing to risk it. There was a Bar shooting in 2011 - enough said.  I AGREE WITH JON TAFFER - SHUT IT DOWN!"}
{"text":"My friend Travis told me he had a blast. First he got hustled by a pool shark, got a good ol western grip handjob in the bathroom gloryhole by a strong handed woman named Stan, and ate some delicious Charlotte sewer-runoff trout.    He said he will return next Tuesday!"}
{"text":"Best place around Gastonia to go hang out and have a few beverages. Coldest beer and cheapest drinks in town, not to mention the food is pretty good too. The bartenders are awesome and know their shit! Always a diverse crowd and a fun time!"}
