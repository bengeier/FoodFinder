{"text":"Love this place! It's always perfect and they're so genuine and polite. We stop in at least once a week!"}
{"text":"I have been here for lunch about 6 times. I would say most of the food I have eaten was very good. I have never experienced any bands since I'm going around lunch time.  The bartenders have been nice, some better than others but that is standard at any bar. I'm sure our company will be going back."}
{"text":"Thursday May 15th, 2014 - Met friends and had beers and dinner. They had their grandchild, we had our 13yo.  Comfortable setting - not worried about having kids there.  Service was good. Food was ok - not bad, not great. Pizza good - like the old Chef Boyardee type you used to make at home.  I liked it.  They had an open mike night thing going on.  It was very enjoyable.  People were brining in their own instruments and singing acoustically.  Two minor complaints -  1)  Music volume was way to high.  Hard to carry on a conversation. 2)  Labatt Blues (draft) were too warm, still drinkable."}
{"text":"New and  improved  bar menu after  this business took over Jocko's.  We had appetizers (pub pretzels and garlic Parmesan wings)  Burgers were exceptionally juicy and served at the perfect temperature.  my friend had the hot Italian sandwich and said it was tasty.  We will be going back...."}
{"text":"Soooo, I'm pretty disappointed that Jocko's is gone and Tripps took its place.  I had been so excited that we had a place in Broadview Heights which served interesting riffs on American and ethnic foods at pretty reasonable prices.  Alas, the place changed ownership and the chef which created that interesting menu is now at Scoundrel's in Berea.  The Wife and I stopped by today, curious whether the menu was the same or not.  There were no menus posted and the friendly bartender/waiter invited us to seat ourselves.  Though we were not super-hungry, (we had just had some tasty Froyo from Cece's, next door) we decided to give it a go.    The interior is typical American sports bar- lots of TV's showing typical sports channels.  It hasn't changed too much, from what I recall from Jocko's- but to be honest, I didn't come to watch sports, I came for the food!  I'll cut to the chase, the menu has gone back to typical American bar food.  I've posted some pictures so you can see what I'm talking about.  Prices were reasonable, it seemed.  I was sad that the short rib potato skins were off the menu, as they were AMAZING before.  We decided to split an artichoke flat bread and I decided to get one of the dollar dog specials.  How can you go wrong with a dollar dog?    While we were waiting for our food, one of the owners stopped by and introduced himself- seemed like a nice guy.  Explained that three folks had purchased the restaurant together.  When I mentioned that we had previously really liked Jocko's, he remarked something along the lines that they were moving away from \"frou frou\" food and were giving a classic American sports bar experience, nice portions and good value.  While we appreciated his entrepreneurial spirit, we were a little dismayed because we had come because we liked the aforementioned \"frou frou\" food.  It was something different, local and at a good price.    The flatbread looked great when it arrived at our table, so we were pretty excited about it.  Then we tasted it.  Disappointing.  The flat bread tasted similar to flattened toast, the cheese was flavorless and the tomatoes didn't have much flavor either.  There was generous amount of it, but we had to slather it with Tobasco sauce to make it at all palatable.  The hot dog was a hotdog, not necessarily high grade Ballpark style dog.  Nicely grilled but I wonder if the bread was a little stale.  I got my $1's worth from it.  I feel a little bad leaving a mediocre review, but I wanted to like this place- I appreciate people investing in my neighborhood.  However, the food was ultimately disappointing, and ultimately, when I leave my house to eat some place, I want to pay for food that is better than what I could make at home, or at least different.    There is a certain crowd which would really enjoy this sort of place- I imagine it could be fun with a group of sports fans, watching the game and having some beer and wings together.  But, I don't plan to come back to this place if eating is the primary thing on my agenda."}
{"text":"3.5. When we pulled in here to eat, I was almost disappointed bc I thought it would be straight bar fried food. I was so pleasantly surprised that I may have rated it more than it deserved. I got the gyro, which was pretty good. Nothing special. My husband got the pulled pork quesadilla. That was what floored me. It was delicious! I couldn't believe how good it was and I think I still can't! The pork was cooked wonderfully and there was plenty of melty cheese. Well done. We also shared a basket of the loaded fries and those were good as well.  The atmosphere was nice, it was a bar but it was a good size and clean. It wasn't too busy so it wasn't loud which was nice. You could prob do better around that area but since there was a wait at Boneyard this wasn't a bad second choice."}
{"text":"I was going to give them three stars but since they've been arrogantly unresponsive to our complaints since 4/6/14. Over two weeks later and apparently they do not care about responding to customer complaints.  First time visiting Tripps since they took over Jockos. My Wife and I ordered Plain Burgers at $6.5 each .... at least that's what the menu said. We asked if they came with fries. Waitress says yes. When the final bill came we had been charged for Cheese burgers at $9 each.  We had not even ordered cheeseburgers! And so now Tripps says the burgers only come with chips and the fries are extra. Menu is deceptive and apparently they want to keep it that way because they have not offered to resolve the discrepancy. The waitress could have explained that the fries were extra as well. When we called to complain we were bluntly told fries are extra ... no apology for resolution for their deceptive menu. Looks like they are out to make a quick buck. Burgers were OK .... we've had much better at Fox and Hound, Cornerstone Brewing, Moosehead and of course Great Lakes Brewing's restaurant.  Large Dortmunders were going for $7 each!!!!!!! Give me a break! 32 ounce Dortmunder at Winking Lizard is $5.50 on Thursday. Fox and Hound regularly charges $6 for their large Dortmunder. $5 for a large Dortmunder at the new Local Tavern in Parma. And to note also ... a small Kentucky Bourbon Ale at Tripps was $6. That's about what we pay for a LARGE one at Tony Mallone's in North Royalton!!!   Band was good but way too loud. I run three studios in Cleveland plus own and play through many rock rigs including four Marshall stacks. I've had a top twenty CD in Canada and was on NPR so I know good sound. Apparently there were others that agreed and left as well. There's good loud and bad loud which means there are bad acoustics at Tripps. Jockos had the same problem due to poor acoustics in the place and Tripps has done nothing to improve the acoustics. Some bands at the old Jockos had a clue about EQing for bad acoustics ... Shout for example had a decent PA and EQ'd properly.   We won't support this restaurant. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Probably the worst wings in town.  When they first brought out the wings half were less than the size of a wing, we are still trying to figure out how that happened.   Most were small, cold and sauce was not flavorful.  When two of us complained they brought us back a new dozen which were not drained and sitting in a pool of oil.  We told the server we didnt want them that have given up.  So now we have 3 dozen wings not touched and the manager had the nerve to only comp us for one dozen.  I told the server all should be he said well we made you more.  Mind you we never asked them.  Horrible food, service and the manager has no customer service skills rather sit at the bar while he should be dealing with the issues of his staff & especially his cook.  Never again even if they paid me to eat there.  It would be nice if Broadview Hts would get some better resturants."}
