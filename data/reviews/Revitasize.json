{"text":"Really nice grab and go juice and snack place.  I've come here for a few years now and I really like the juices mostly the fruit based ones.  They also make delicious vegan protein balls, I'm not vegan they are delicious for anyones taste.  Also staff are nice and give good service."}
{"text":"I live across the street and it's basically my second home. My favourites are the Acai Super Bowl for breakfast and the Maca Power shake for an afternoon boost. There are a few places in the neighbourhood to get smoothies and cold pressed juices, but this one is hands down the best."}
{"text":"My opinion: steer clear. Not sure how they even got above a 1 star review. They sell trash at a premium. You've been warned."}
{"text":"Perfectly matches the classic vegan juice bar ideal. Conveniently located in the center of Yorkville, a perfect place to grab breakfast or a snack. I ordered the plunger, which was a silky fruity smoothie blend which was surprisingly not too sweet at all! The staff is warm and welcoming, and the joint is quiet and not busy before 10 AM. The interior is meticulously furnished, however, there is no air conditioning during the summer. The food leans on the pricey side as expected, but it is a nice treat for once in a while. Was an overall pleasant experience, and I will probably be returning in the near future!"}
{"text":"Big time miss!!!! Bought a $13.00 petit Acai Bowl for lunch. The fruit toppings were partially frozen which made it inedible. First and a last, save your money and Calories!!! USE FRESH PRODUCE!!!!"}
{"text":"I bought a week's worth of juice from Revitasize, Yorkville (picked up on different days) and each juice I had was really delicious (tried almost all of them) - my personal favourites being the yellow ones... and the active charcoal lemonade. The bottles are also larger than most of their competitors.

At first, the price seemed quite steep at approximately $13/bottle, but after purchasing my own Omega Juicer (which, for starters, doesn't even compare to their highly sophisticated Cold Press machines despite being one of the bests on the mainstream market) and making my own juices, the cost makes a lot more sense - A LOT of produce can fit into those bottles... Like bowls and bowls and bowls of salad  plus organic produce is already quite pricey in general, then factor in the cost of your machine (over $300), cost of electricity and TIME - time you spend buying the ingredients, washing them, cutting them, juicing, then washing all the pieces of your juicer... I don't know about you, but I'd rather spend $13 on a solid bottle of clean, healthy nourishment and use that hour to make 2, 3 perhaps even 4x more money actually working... 

As for service, the gentleman at the counter (he may have been the owner) was friendly, patient, and very thorough with the instructions.  He was more than willing to answer some of my questions about juicing in general. He also carefully selected each juice in my plan to make sure I had enough variety.  

The store was very clean, spacious and organized (as you can clearly see in the pictures). The seating is limited but then again, it's not a cafe and it would probably do us some good to get off our butts for a few minutes a day...

A note of personal preference: I also tried the cashew nut milk.  Nope. Not going to try that again. Not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"I first tried an Acai bowl in Vancouver earlier this year. I was hooked at first bite and for the longest time, I couldn't find anything in Toronto that compared. Most places that sell them here (and there aren't many) seem to focus more of their business on their other products like juices and smoothies. Well, I have to say, Revitasize nails it! It was really delicious. A perfect blend of Acai, banana, almond butter (or you can have peanut butter) and shredded coconut. Now I just wish they'd open a location in the Beaches or Leslieville!"}
{"text":"Revitasize opened last week and boy am I excited that they've joined the neighbourhood. I've been buying juice from Revitasize for almost two years now, and from their first location in Thornhill for the past 6 months. 

Between their tasty juices, shakes and food options, they are hands down, the BEST cold pressed juice company in this city. They have something like 30+ juices, which is WAY more as far as options than any other juice company in the city. They also have amazzzzing shakes, hot soups, wraps, salads, bean/lentil/quinoa boxes, teas, vegan pucks and protein balls. Everything is organic and gluten free. The company is family owned and operated and puts EXTREME care into their product and service. 

I would strongly recommend trying your first cleanse with Revitasize. You can't beat their price or their selection!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Nice, clean place in Yorkville serving health foods and juices.

Service: The guy at the counter seemed pretty nonchalant and didn't really acknowledge us anymore soon after we paid for our product, even though we ate inside the store.

Product Review: My boyfriend and I specifically went there for the Acai bowl since we were on a quest to look for one that is comparable to the ones we've had in Brazil.  I've got to say that this one was the worst one I've tried in Toronto.  The smoothie base came out tasting like a frozen raspberry sorbet with no hint of acai what-so-ever.  Because of the frozen smoothie base, the granola and dried fruit that were on top of the smoothie became hard and difficult to chew. It was definitely not worth the amount of money spent!

Recommendation:  The store looks like it may have some other great products if you're into healthy options or pressed juice.  Just save your $12.00 to buy something else instead of the acai bowl."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: i love juice. I really love juice.  When I don't have juice, I am sad.

Given that, it may not have taken much to convert me, but oh how I am converted! I popped in the other day and babbled to the guy working there (maybe the owner? Not sure) how I was traveling and I was all run down and tired and out of energy. He recommended a cold-pressed immunity shot (ginger, oil of oregano, and maybe lemon). You save fifty cents if you drink it there and give him back the bottle.  I drank mine and also bought a bottle of Blue Magic (named for the kind of algae that's in it).  Soon after, I wasn't quite up to feeling glorious, but I felt much, much better.  And I had the energy to take care of myself, which was huge.

I didn't try any food (though I did go back today for more immunity shots). The guy there said they'd soon be shipping everything online (I'm guessing he only meant the juices but am not sure.) 

One thing to mention is I'm not sure if there's any seating. If there is, it's maybe a stool or two at the window. It's a small place, so not the best for hanging out."}
{"text":"The acai bowls are delicious! I had one as a snack and it was surprisingly filling. Texture is a hybrid between ice cream and smoothie, so it's healthy AF but tastes like a treat :) Also love their ginger shots, which will be my new go-to when I'm starting to get sick. So glad they opened in my hood!"}
{"text":"Came here to grab breakfast on a Sunday morning 

Pros
- Nice ambiance 

Cons
- Absurdly priced the options that you get
- Taste is sub par. 

Would not recommend"}
{"text":"I have been going to there for over 1.5 months now and I am thoroughly enjoying all aspects this company has to offer.
The staff are very kind and knowledgeable about what goes into the juices and which ones meet my specific needs.

The aesthetic and ambiance of the store is very calming and welcoming.

My favorite are the soups ... more specifically the Broccoli Dill = DELICIOUS!!!

 I will be returning shortly to get another subscription."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this juice shop. Great selection of juices and pre-made vegan plates. Staff is friendly and knowledgable about the products. I'm lucky to live so close!

Bonus - they have the best bottle return program out of all the fresh pressed juice company's!"}
{"text":"I am so grateful to this place, the immunity shots really helped me to see what a difference quality organic food can make to your health.

The juice packages are really worth it, the soups are really great as well!"}
{"text":"Revitasize is definitely a good addition to the Dufferin and Center plaza which until now was only redeeming due to the Tim Horton's and the nail salon. 

The interior is beautiful and set up like other juice bars in the city. Prices are also very similar, in the $9-11 range. I tried the sweet kale, which in my opinion was too sweet. Although it definitely tasted better than other green juices, I couldn't really taste the other ingredients at all due to the overwhelming taste of pear juice; this made me skeptical as to how much greens I was actually getting. This may be my personal preference but I can see how others who are not used to hardcore greens on a regular basis would find it easier to drink.

They have a great selection of gluten free goods, salads and soups and the paleo nut balls topped with raw coconut were excellent."}
{"text":"Finally a raw vegan joint close to my home! Excellent friendly service. I loved their kale salad. They have a ton of juices and you can also order an amazing and tasty acai bowl. They also have raw vegan treats!"}
{"text":"Really good cold pressed drinks! Best in Vaughn for sure. Prices are also better than anywhere else in the city."}
{"text":"Visiting from NYC where we have fresh juice juice bars everywhere, Revitasize did not disappoint. Their peanut butter acai bowl of the month was fantastic especially if you like but butters! The super bowl was very good topped with goji berries. The Avocado Matcha shake was so refreshing, if I was to come back I'd ask them to leave out the agave as I'm not a fan of it but other that this place very good!"}
{"text":"I got the green tea matcha shake with vegan protein (extra $1.25).  

Honestly, the shake tasted amazing.  It had a great taste and the matcha wasn't overwhelming all the flavours like it is when you order bubble tea.  

The menu also appeared to be completely vegan and they had prepared soups, prepared meals, prepared health shots, vegan pucks (I assume these are like protein bars), etc.  So for the variety, definitely an A+.  

So why 3 stars?  

a) Pricing - I ended up paying $12 for a smoothie because I added vegan pea protein to it. I have no problem paying extra for protein, but how do I even know it was added or how much?   I can get a great power smoothie at Cold Pressery in Mississauga for around $9.  I guess the $3 extra is the Yorkville tax.  

b) Lack of seating.  For the prices, I would expect at least a couple of tables instead of just two lounge chairs and a small window bar.   There was ample room to fit at least 3 small tables in there.

Verdict: Good drinks, good assortment, but WAY too overpriced and won't likely visit again."}
{"text":"The juices that we tried (3 of them but can't remember which ones) were quite tasty but ranging from $9 to $14 a bottle, they ought to be. The place inside was nice and rustic. 

My issue with this place started when we were told to return the glass bottles for a $1/bottle refund but upon doing so, were told that the register's till wouldn't open so they credited the $3 on a Revitasize card instead. On a business scale, this makes perfect sense however I thought this was a bit underhanded and put me off from the place. The woman who was serving also came across this way - not trustworthy."}
{"text":"Visited the location at 1470 Centre Street, Thornhill.  A true juice bar with nutritionally dense raw snacks, salad and soup options as well.  The juices are served in glass bottles.  Juices just taste better that way.  Customized cleansing protocols are available.  We appreciate the use of organic and gluten free foods in the preparations."}
{"text":"Cold pressed juice in Vaughan?! Yassss. I love finding my favourite things around the GTA. After seeing this pop up on my yelp page so many times, I've decided to bookmark it and hit it up the next day. Right at centre st and dufferin, I begin to realize that I pass this place every single time on the viva purple to York U the past 4 years.. If I knew, I would've definitely got off at the dufferin stop to grab some pressed juice on the way home! :'(

The fridge is amazing, with a great variety of pressed juice! Usually places have 4-5 choices but they had pressed juice, acai bowls, smoothies, soups and even shots for health! The immune booster with ginger seems like it'd be amazing and the other ones look great. They also come in cute little bottles! As for the juice, my heart said yes to all of them but my wallet screamed 'NO.' It's so awesome that they have a subscription - 10 bottles for $100. This is a deal considering that their drinks range from $10-$13. They had a bunch of delicious sounding ones but I went with the one with the pretty teal colour - Blue Magic, which was all veggies. It had such a unique taste and slightly reminded me of watered down mouthwash in the best way possible. It left my insides feeling great! The boy got the a fruity one, as he ain't about the veggie life as much. His honeydew drink was called 'Dew Good' and I can only taste the honeydew in it. If you're a melon head, you'll be all about this! 

For 2 bottles, it came to about $24 which was pricey but WORTH IT! It's not everyday I get to treat myself out to pressed juice and I'd definitely rather get one of these than any of those sugary, dairy filled drinks at local coffee shops. 

I'll be back! I love you!"}
{"text":"I have a new obsession with the Acai Bowl! I dream about these things. My favourite is the Super-Bowl. The acai itself is blended almost into a sorbet and topped with sliced bananas, goji berries, shredded coconut and trail mix. I also always add peanut butter (and pomegranate if I'm feeling frisky). For what you get, it ain't that cheap, but it's so delicious I just can't help myself. 

Revitasize, if you're reading this, please open a location at Yonge & Eglinton!"}
{"text":"Good options for vegan and gf meals and snacks. Tons of juices and soups too. Bring your old bottle back to get a discount off next purchase."}
{"text":"I am so happy that revitasize started to deliver to our doorsteps!

I ordered a one day juice cleanse and delivery was prompt. Also ordered a side salad, kombucha, a vegan soup  and vegan cheesecake .They ran out of the kombucha and I got a phone call offering me substitutions. I declined and I received a refund notification right away- that was pretty impressive

The juice and salads are of pretty good quality and I'm particularly impressed with the generous portion their ginger booster shot. Is double thr size of other juiceries ive been to. 

I highly recommend their juices + vegan desserts from this place! Will definitely order again"}
{"text":"Looking for the local juice bar. This place has everything from freshly pressed juices to salads and other vegan Raw meal options.

I love coming here for the juice options they have a great selection the Reds the greens and even an interesting blue lemonade.

The meal options hear are awesome they have everything you need from salads protein pucks and various other options that can satisfy any hunger.

The lattes and tea options are also pretty good not my favorite out of the options that they have here. But they are satisfying and are reasonably enjoyable.

Pricing is pretty good considering what you're getting and the quality of the products. I always enjoy coming in for a combo juice and salad it's really worth the money.

I wouldn't mind seeing them starting to offer organic coffee or other organic beverages I know that they have introduce smoothies parfaits and other items but still there are some things I would tweak not conventional organic or vegan options that would be available.

Thanks for the amazing lunch yesterday I'll be back really soon."}
{"text":"Located in a small plaza the parking you'll find a bit tight but plenty.

Venue: It's more of a juice and snack bar, if you were expecting a place where you could order a meal and sit down, this is not it. There's seating available but what you can order are mostly snacks, smoothies, rolls, juices and soups.

I'd say it's a bit pricey for the average eater, but that's the price you pay for eating healthy.

I've tried the protein balls, the apple vegan puck and their spring rolls. All three were delicious."}
{"text":"I love their Maca root smoothie it is my all-time favorite... They have a great recycling program with all their jars and containers, their soups are fantastic I recommend the mushroom coconut soup it's a combination of Portabella mushrooms, white mushrooms, coconut milk, onions, cilantro and timian. Everything is organic raw coldpressed gluten-free dairy free. They have multiple locations Mississauga, Parkdale, Thornhill, Woodbridge, Yorkville

The ultimate bowl is amazing it has peanut butter, trail mix, banana shredded coconut, goji berries, chai seeds, and vegan protein

Revitalize also has cleanse programs they offer over 32 organic coldpressed juice options that all taste amazing, my reason for going on the cleanse included trying to get away from drinking caffeine and smoking and white sugar. I've had great results they also offer online support and customer service, if you sign up online you will get 10% off with signup10 on your entire order... An amazing company and great prices"}
{"text":"I love that I don't have to schlep downtown to a juice bar, finally one opened up in Thornhill!!! 

My favourite go to place to grab a quick HEALTHY meal on the go! 

Is it delicious... Yes. Is it affordable... Yes!

All their prepped meals are fresh and tasty. It's clean and bright in the store and very welcoming. I'm a huge fan of their ACAI bowls , protein packed sweets &a juices.... honestly you can't go wrong with anything! 

They're always coming out with new and delicious meals and treats... they keep my on my toes!"}
{"text":"Went here on the advice of a friend who had a cold and said the ginger shots were like magic as she got better asap. So I bought one to try as well as a juice Burdock Splash, similiar to the ginger shot (burdock root, apple, turmeric, ginger, cayenne). 

Staff here was knowledgable and helpful. She gave lots of recommendations and also said to chug the small shot like it's alcohol. Too funny! The ginger shot was amazing & it had a spicy after taste. Usually not a fan of ginger but the taste wasn't bad at all (anything to not feel crappy) and it felt great after (esp. the throat)! I did not want to rely on tylenol and felt better after a day or so. Price was alright as well. I am definitely coming back if/when I'm sick again. They also sold snacks, gluten free foods, etc.

Revitasize also has a subscription program to save on juice. It never expires.
10 juices - $100
21 Juices - $200
33 Juices - $300
67 Juices - $600

Bottle Return Program
2oz. Shot bottle - $0.50
500 mL Soup Jar - $0.50
1L Soup Jar - $1.00

500 mL Juice bottle - $1.00"}
{"text":"Conceptually, very overpriced, but, on the other hand, totally in line with pricing you'd find in the U.S. 

Good products, but there is an inconsistency in the shakes depending on who makes it. If you're paying top $$, it'd be nice to have it done right every time."}
{"text":"I used to think that Acai bowls came in cups... then Revitasize opened up down the street from my building and I learned what an Acai bowl was really all about. In the last week I have tried the revita-bowl, the super-bowl, and today, I customized my own bowl with 4 different types of nuts, Banana, and Goji barriers. And let me tell you, It was fantastic!!!!  I really love the fact that this place is vegan and uses local organic produce, not only is their Acai bowl tangy, sweet, and delicious, but their staff (Hey Daniel!!!) are SO helpful!!!! Daniel is a nutritionist and helped me figure out which juices I should get to correct my vitamin deficiencies (Iron & B). I have been to many juice shops and this was the first one where the staff didn't juice pressure me into getting their \"best tasting\" or \"most expensive\" juice. Instead he really cared about making me healthier. 
Thank you so much for you amazing customer service!! This has definitely become my new morning ritual. 
Amy"}
{"text":"I'm amazed with the product these guys serve. It is so refreshing and tastey too. I would highly recommend it to everyone. The items are a bit over priced but then again it is all organic and fresh."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!!

Great smooothies - the Maca Power is my fave to satisfy a sweet craving.
Hot chocolate - omg! Dairy free and refined sugar free AND TASTY!!!!!!! You can get it without any sweetener. This is great because I don't have to spend $6 at Starbucks for an unhealthy hot chocolate when I am craving it.
The coconut kefir - OMG!!!!!! For years I stayed away from yogurt because 1. it didn't agree with my body 2. I don't like cold yogurt in the mornings or for a snack. But this baby it is the best. I can't wait to have it with some paleo granola, coconut chips and stevia drops.

This place is a life saver for someone who wants to eat healthy in the Yorkville area."}
{"text":"Compared to the other Vaughn location ...  What a disappointment on all accounts.  From no service or even a single associate seen in 5 minutes to the poorly made wraps and the yellow leaves in the salad... I could never recommend this spot in good conscience.  A soggy vegan wrap, wilted leaves salad, and a decent medium smoothie came up to $32.  Expensive absolutely and overpriced for food quality.

So I bought the wrong things here but I still believe if you put it on your menu, it should be edible.  Especially if your mantra is about being healthy.  If it's wilting... it probably isn't healthy.  So where do I even start with the problems.

When I walked in, two other tables were sitting and I knew there was staff ... somewhere.  There was no one at the counter and the kitchen was silent.  I kid you not that I stood there for 5 minutes.  Another person came in to buy something and he was talking to one of the tables.  Finally the person from table talking to the customer behind us... just got up and went into the back door into the kitchen.  Wow ... she was part of the staff but more than happy to let us sit? After she sat back at her table, it was another few moments before someone appeared behind the counter.  I'm amazed how they're still in business.

Ordering was not easy as the person wasn't really paying attention to what I was saying and well... she seemed to interject at random with half spoken questions.  \"Asian ... Peanut?\"  \"Excuse me?\" \"Asian or Peanut?\" \"...\" \"for your sauces...\".  I maybe petite but saying Asian Peanut seemed like an insult to start off your first question.

Lean Greens salad - wilted yellow leaves ... I should have checked out the bottom of the salad before buying but I expected a place to NOT sell expired food.  I have to say something about the containers... yes they're sanitary which is nice but they're incredibly hard to open.  Like 3 different people couldn't.  As for the other ingredients...  I think they were ok.  Some of the sweet potato seemed gooey but maybe it's cause the salad is old.  2/5

Vegan Wrap - using a rice wrap, quinoa, sprouts, pomegranate, sweet potatoes, and cucumbers are inside.  Because they placed the loosely wrapped rolls on damp lettuce. The rice wrap was soggy and fell apart immediately when you tried to lift it.  Just overall really unenjoyable to eat.  The only pro would be the peanut sauce ...  it was pretty decent. 2/5

Very berry smoothie - maybe their smoothies are the only decent thing.  It tasted like strawberries and it was a rich texture.  I would say it's pretty good ... not overly sweet.  I wish other fruit would be in there too.  3.5/5 

I would say this has to be one the worst casual experiences this year.  Service was vacant and inattentive.  Food was expired and it was expensive.   I wish I could offer another alternative to this spot but sadly can't.  I'll keep searching for good healthier eats near York U."}
{"text":"I loved their first location and of course love this location. Outstanding, high quality products with friendly, professional service. Their juices are amazing, and the Acai Bowl and Maca Power Smoothie are my forever loves. Thanks Revitasize for giving us a healthy living outlet that we can trust! Eating healthy got a lot easier since your existence!"}
{"text":"Shocked that this place has no ratings on here yet. So here I am! I am a regular customer. I love this place very much. I usually drink a juice or two a day and I am obsessed with the kale bars. Everybody who works here is lovely and has a lot of great information and tips for healthy living. 

I should mention that prior to the opening of this place, I was never a fan of raw juices- I would drink smoothies or milkshakes but never juice. I am now a believer and my favourites are The Reliever, Citrus Bliss and Dew Good. 

They have healthy kale granola bars and apple-quinoa cakes and other yummies. 

They also have a menu of fruit smoothies and another favourite of mine, Acai Bowl, which is like a really thick acai smoothie in a bowl and you get to choose the toppings from a wide variety they have (different kinds of nuts, seeds, chia, coconut, pomegranate). 

The ONLY problem I have with this place are the prices, but considering I am a regular, clearly I have gotten over that in return for the amazing service and products they provide. Each bottle of juice averages at around $10 a bottle, kale bar $4.50. 

I highly recommend stopping by this place. Refreshing drinks, refreshing people, and all around a great stop at any point in the day."}
{"text":"This is a store that has finally figured out how to make things both healthy and delicious. They have a huge variety of delicious smoothies, juices, Acai bowls, salads, etc-- it's almost impossible to choose, and i usually find myself wanting a taste of everything! My favourites are the burdock splash, maca power and vegan pucks. So amazing to have something like this exist finally in the neighbourhood! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Great customer service till they have your money!!!!!! Five day program for two people and not one day was correct. Three trips to pickup the juices and not once was the order correct or ready. On the last day they gave us another clients juices, worst $500.00 ever spent.
Never received a call from a manager, if they even have one, to apologize for the inconvenience. Take your money elsewhere........"}
{"text":"It's just... expensive. I know y'all don't need those bullshit glass bottles. Also since when is adding publicly accessible charcoal supplements to lemonade make the cost suddenly jump to an average of $15/bottle? Are you shitting me? It's fine, the juice is truly fresh I'm just not rich enough to afford scams ATM."}
