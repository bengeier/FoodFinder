{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Fish and chips with generous portions and that home cooked taste. I'm always asked \"what can I make you for dinner? \" If you love old syle fish and chips and friendly folks this is the place to go"}
{"text":"Far too much batter on the fish, which meant batter was soggy/wet inside and only thing you could taste. Maybe I went on a bad night as others say it is good."}
{"text":"I used to hang out here all the time in highschool.  I feel bad now that the owner had to put up with all those kids.  The food here was always good though, very tasty, and very affordable.  I wouldn't go too far out of my way to get here, but if you're in the mood for fish and chips then this place won't dissapoint.  Its often quiet here, and also not the biggest place.
