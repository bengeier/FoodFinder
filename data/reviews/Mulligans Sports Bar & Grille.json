{"text":"This place sucks donkey balls. I didn't get anything to eat because the food that I saw people eating looks really subpar.  I'll put it this way, if you have a Donald Trump sticker on your truck, you like going somewhere where you could possibly get into a fight or buy some drugs, if you're a 21 year old guy with mud on your boots who's desperate to just stick it in somebody, this might just be the place for you."}
{"text":"Good safe fun! Thanks for all the quality I get!"}
{"text":"By far the saltiest food Ive ever eaten in a restaurant. Threw half my meal out ot was so salty. Will never eat here again."}
{"text":"I do realize this is a bar and it's hard to maintain on busy nights. However, service is hit or miss. I've been here on several occasions and enjoyed myself, mostly. It's a local bar where you visit with the locals.  The music isn't too too loud so conversations are still possible. Though the staff will wipe the counters, somehow, sticky is a staple. Pool and Corn Hole are main activities and the bathrooms aren't the worst bar bathrooms I've seen. Overall, okay. Never overcrowded but definitely a larger weekend crew. The staff isn't always part of the friendly bartender club though. Mostly, understood, however, good service to drunks means great tips. Especially, at a local joint. Make a few friends and work becomes easy.  This is pretty close to home for me so I'll still visit. Just a few things I might change to keep a better crowd."}
{"text":"I live close and go in to grab a bite on occasions. Food is always good and staff always friendly. The regulars make it a comfy little place to frequent."}
{"text":"My friend and I came to Mulligans hoping to have a few drinks on St. Patrick's day night. We were seated at the bar with plenty of seats open (not very busy) after waiting over 10 minutes to even be acknowledged we were asked what we wanted just  (a beer each) we were dismissed rudely by the bartender because we informed him that we had been sitting here for a long time while people who sat down after us were being served. We also witnessed the bus boy and bartender taking a shot behind the bar. It was a terrible experience and I do not recommend anyone visiting this establishment. This may have been a off night for a bad crew working because I have been here a few times before and had excellent service and food."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch today, the bartender was super nice and very attentive. The place is very low key, with a wonderful bar menu; the Philly cheese steak was excellent.  If you want uptight and highbrow this is the wrong place for you.  If you want a place to unwind Mulligans is for you."}
{"text":"First time here. Really great experience. Laid-back atmosphere and crowd. Cold beer, excellent, friendly service, good food, and and a nice big bar to better view the games.  Not sure why other reviewer \"Matt\" has such a stick up his ass, unless he walked in that way. Stick removal is one thing Mulligan's won't help with. As long as that's not your problem, you should have a great time!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have gotten to know Eric at The Dirty Martini Lounge and when we found out he ran the bar at Mulligans we had to check it out. We grabbed a cocktail as we played trivia. Nice, low key environment with good service. Flash forward a couple months and I'm killing time waiting for my daughter who is practicing with her choir at school. I sat at a quiet table and Eric came over and took my order. It was Taco Tuesday and I got a chicken taco. It was very yummy, just perfect for a light dinner and at $2, a bargain! I'm bringing my hubby back here soon, especially on a Tuesday!"}
{"text":"Just moved to this area. Mulligans is a Great place to grab a drink and has good bar food with a good range to choose from. Very friendly staff and lots of tv's. I like to play pool as well so it's a great hangout. Located in a spot that's easy to get to without getting hung up in a large shopping center with traffic jams. Great local place."}
{"text":"Eric will see to it that you have a satisfied experience and if not talk to him. BJ always a great bartender."}
{"text":"The people are friendly, the service is superb, the food is delicious, the atmosphere is super friendly... I love it!! I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Nice hidden gem. We came around 1pm and we were the only ones in there so service was really good lol.  They have taco Tuesday's!! $1 beef tacos and $2 chicken tacos. They are both good. Comes with a flour tortilla with lettuce, tomato and cheese. Also comes with a side of salsa and tortilla chips.   We also ordered chips and salsa and a side of queso. The queso was only .99 if you buy the chips and salsa. They were huge portions.   We will definitely come back again. They offer daily specials and they have pool tables!"}
{"text":"At Mulligans, you get exactly what you'd expect. It's not a fancy joint by any stretch, but they get the job done with a nice drink selection, good specials, quality beer list, your typical bar food, and very friendly staff. They make homemade lemoncello shots which will hit you hard, so watch out.  Also, they have TapTV for trivia!"}
{"text":"This place rocks! It has a cool basketball game, and though it's nothing super fancy, the food ain't bad. The bartenders are hilarious, and the music is cool."}
