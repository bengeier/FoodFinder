{"text":"The food here is fantastic. The tiny cheicken balls are the best that I have tried. Best chinese food in town."}
{"text":"Very weak Chinese food. General Tso chicken was mediocre, everything else was awful. Chicken wings not cooked through, bones were practically dripping with blood. Wontons in the soup tasted rotted, chicken fried rice was extremely bland. Won't be trying this place again!"}
{"text":"Pathetic...over an hour for a simple take out order..it would have taken less time to drive to Toronto China Town.   Food was mediocre..the only reason this place exists is that is the only place in this backwater town. 

Not recommended.."}
{"text":"How could I have forgotten about this little place, tucked in the corner of the plaza here in Bolton. Wah Wi - not just a funny name, but great grub in Bolton. Now for my friends reading this of the purist persuasion when it comes to Asian cuisine, I'll admin this may not be for your, BUT for those of us who enjoy the occasional meal based on flavour alone - Wah Wi is where it's at.

My fave item here is General Tso chicken by far. When I used to work in the area, you would be able to call ahead and ask for the special combo which would come packed with food, and then you could make the special request to have the GT Extra spicy and extra crispy - definitely how I recommend you do this meal up! 

Just thinking about it now is getting the drool going, looks like I'll need a visit to Bolton sooner than I thought.

Fair warning this place can be tough to find to be sure to keep an eye open.

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"There are a few dishes we like here, but I've had a few I didn't like as well.  Usually I like to explore a menu but here I stick to the safe bets: any kind of breaded chicken, mostly.

It's good enough that we have it every few months."}
{"text":"There were actually maggots in my chicken fried rice tonight. I have come here for 10 years with no issue but found multiple maggots in my rice when I got my order home. 

The rice is made in large servings and I thought everyone should know as this is a public health issue and could potentially make someone very sick."}
{"text":"Great food, made fresh and what a surprise! In Bolton."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food. Friendly service. Not sure why the bad rating but I would suggest trying it."}
