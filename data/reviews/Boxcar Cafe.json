{"text":"This place was really missing from the Beltline; yay! Great selection of games, great coffee, great nibblies, super reasonable rate for games, and great staff. It can get a little loud depending on the groups in there, but its coziness is also part of the charm."}
{"text":"Great alternative place to go on a Saturday night with friends! They're open late and serve alcohol. The service was great and food was amazing! Try the pesto chicken sandwich and coconut brownie yumyum"}
{"text":"I think that if you're into games then this is the place for you. Our waitress was a little distracted despite the fact that we were the only guests at the time. Quite a nice vibe and an okay menu. The soda was the highlight fir me."}
{"text":"Delicious! I had the strawberry/brie/turkey croissant and my husband had the ham pretzel roll. I also liked the playful atmosphere with the striped walls, board games, and crossword on the bathroom walls."}
{"text":"Went there to try their poutine for the yyc poutine week  It was a nice place  Staff was nice  But the food was awful  Tater tots poutine          the gravy was frozen and tasted like veggie oil           The cheese curds were yummy            The tater tots were not crispy and no flavour  Gyazo    - were soggy     - but tasted okay  Everything tasted like cheap grocery store frozen food that was cooked in microwave   For the 18 dollars I paid it was a huge disappointment and won't be back"}
{"text":"I have just recently discovered this lovely place and I've already been there twice and planning my third trip. I have stopped in for coffee and a delicious pastry before work and taken a date there for board games and beer in the evening. This place is adorable, fun and the staff are super nice."}
{"text":"Second time returning to grab a latte since I am in the area. Their latte is pretty good and they know how to make the fancy artwork. Yes they have the fancy espresso machine. This is a boardgame place and its pretty cool with the amount of games they have. Only fall back is that this place is very small.   Great place to have gathering with a good selection of boardgames. Definitely will be able to find something for everyone."}
{"text":"What a terrific, fun trend board game cafes are, and one exploding in Calgary. We stumbled on recently-opened Boxcar yesterday while musing about where to grab a coffee before wine buying at Vine Arts; the new cafe attached to 10 Foot Henry wasn't yet open, but I'd heard that Boxcar had Phil & Sebastian so in we went, and what a perfect choice it ended up being. We didn't play any games, just two espressos for us, but they were absolutely perfect. It was a Costa Rican bean from P&S that I'd had a few days ago at Postino and it's one of the loveliest I've ever had from that roaster. Made with extreme care, dialled in carefully, weighed, the first shot sacrificed so the barista could taste it to make sure it was okay, all made on a cool new Rancilio that I'd seen at Bowtruss in LA.   There is a tiny patio here in a very cool, small but comfortable, space, a food menu I didn't really  make note of, and really, REALLY good coffee... finally, on 1st St SW."}
{"text":"Great place to play board games with friends.  They even had a large long table for our group of 11.  Huge selection of games organized by type.  We had some beverages during our time there.  Will visit again!"}
