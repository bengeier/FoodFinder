{"text":"Usually come here for lunch and get the Japanese pork cutlet rice bowl. Its usually pretty decent and filling but I recently noticed a significant drop in quality. Last time I went, the pork cutlet looked like thin slices of ham...  The free iced green tea that comes with every lunch is a plus though."}
{"text":"I went there a couple of times and the food was great. I chose optional ingredients and it was good but I had to wait a long time all of my family members got their ramen except for me . Plus I'm not really a fast eater so every one had to wait for me . But I love the green tea drink ( cold ) I haven't tried the hot version but I think it's good!"}
{"text":"Cheap and decent noodles. Definitely bang for the buck. The combos come with a bubbletea and ice cream.  It's not exactly authentic Japanese ramen noodles, but the noodles aren't the worst tasting things either. I've been here several times and the texture of the noodles are not very consistent. Sometimes it's really soft and mushy and sometimes it's really chewy. I guess it depends on which chef is cooking that day.  One thing I really liked from here was the deep-fried oysters. It was done really well the last time I ordered it. These huge oysters are coated with breadcrumbs and then deep fried. It was super hot and crispy when it was served. Definitely a thumbs up for this dish!"}
{"text":"Writing this as a Grade 10 student at the school next door.  Their ramen is DIVINE, my favourites being the Kyushu and Bloody Chef ramen. They have pretty good bubble tea, and their lunch specials (4.99 for a meal) have the best fries I've seen in an Asian place. Good luck ordering if you don't speak Canto or Mando, though, and remember to leave a 10% tip or else. Also, don't go around 11ish on weekdays, cause that's the Grade 9 lunch and it'll get pretty crowded and noisy. Oh, and cash only. Overall, epic place to go for lunch."}
{"text":"WOULD NOT RECOMMEND. The place mainly earns student lunch money as the high school Pierre Elliott Trudeau high school is within close walking distance. I attended this high school and every time I need to go to the plaza to grab food, I never go to pixel 8 because of the service and the food quality. The ramen pork and green iced tea for 4.99 is cheap, yea, but friends have found cockroaches in their soup broth. Also, if you don't tip at least 10%, they will pressure you for tips. Most people just don't come here often enough to experience this."}
{"text":"It's cheap $4.99 for their lunch special (Ramen + Ice Tea). The ramen itself is just ok, pretty basic.   Hmm, if I can get it in my neighborhood, maybe I'll visit it for 2nd time. It's not worth it to drive to this place from downtown Toronto.  Warning: It's very packed with students during lunch time. The noise level is super high."}
{"text":"UPDATE: Management has been making new changes to the menu. The Osaka Ramen no longer comes with delicious shrimp tempura. Certain ramens are now only available at certain times. It is getting ridiculous. The last three times I went, they were not able to accommodate the ramen I wanted. New servers are also kind of absentminded. In addition, they changed the main store sign from a pixelatied \"PIXEL 8\" to what looks almost like Times New Roman font. WHY? WHY FIX WHAT WAS NOT BROKEN? The former rating was 3/5, I have since dropped it to a generous 1/5. As a frequent customer, I do not think I will be returning to Pixel 8.  Location: On Kennedy and Bur Oak. A convenient location for students of the nearby high school and Markham residents. Ample parking lot space, though this location has competition in the plaza (many other food places including Subway, Pizza Pizza, and other asian restaurants). If you don't like noise and rowdy teens, avoid the weekday lunch and after school hours. I usually come at dinner (6-7pm) and it is quiet and peaceful.  Facility: Decor is minimalist and modern appealing to the younger crowd. However, on a closer look, items displayed for looks are quite dusty. Washroom as minuscule (feels like you are in a capsule). Imagine half the size of your typical washroom stall. No room to move/wiggle, you'll be touching the door with your head. I am petite and I had trouble getting in and out. Kitchen is visible through the pass through. TV is available, usually on CP24, on Chinese channel late nights.   Food Quality & Price: We came for the quick and cheap ramen. We know the ramen soup base (and we can taste) the powder/mix, but it is still pretty good for instant ramen. Price is cheap, portions are sizable. Certain ramen dishes can be upgraded to a combo where you can get a black or green tea. Drinks are cheaper than your typical BBT location, around $4 each. However, quality of drinks are slightly below that of your typical BBT place. I really liked the Mint Milk Green Tea. Double check the cups, sometimes they are foamy from soap or smudged from lazy washing. Favourite ramen among members of our group are: Osaka ramen with lobster soup base, Kyoto ramen with miso soup base, House Special ramen with soy soup base, and Spicy Dragon (\"mild, medium, super spicy and super super spicy\" as quoted by one of our waiters lol). NOTE: Spicy Dragon is no longer available, it's been replaced by Volcano which has tomato in it. Ew.  Service: Average staff. The middle aged lady, the younger lady (serious face, chin length hair  who works the weekday evening shift), and young man medium build, were all great. They were attentive and quick, always saying thank you as we leave. ** Most of these people not longer work here. New staff are quite incompetent. Young kids who don't know what they're doing and older staff who don't speak English or Canto.  Overall: Pixel 8 is a very convenient location for me. I will be returning many times after this review simply because I live nearby and the experience is always decent. However, would I travel out of my way for the ramen? Probably not, but it's not a bad change of scenery. The also have outlets and free wifi. UPDATE: I will no longer be returning after all the unnecessary changes made to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Probably the best ramon meal I have had. The fried ice cream is really good and very different and unique. Def check it out... Well worth the price"}
{"text":"Pixel 8 is the place to go for authentic Japanese ramen.  It's in a good area, right next to a high school, so it's crowded during lunch time peaks, but still manageable.  The soup base for the ramen soup is very tasty and filling. It's hard to explain in words, just that it leaves you wanting another serving. The ramen noodles themselves are also very tasty, and they don't get soggy, as you sometimes find with noodles. They taste nothing like store-bought noodles, as I've seen some comment. As for the toppings, just get whatever suits your taste, as they all come in great portions. If you're one of those people who just won't get full, you can add an extra portion of noodles for a low cost, which I appreciate when I'm starving.  The sides are well cooked, though often a bit lacking in portions, which is the main reason I stick to the noodles, and also the reason why I'm taking a star off, for the lack of adequate portions, though if I could I'd take half a star off.  The drinks are average, and if you like that sort of thing go for bubble tea (w/ tapioca if you're up for it,  I know several people who wouldn't eat tapioca if it would save their lives). The passion fruit bubble tea in particular really suits me, and I recommend you try that out. Also, as I'm a weakling who can't sleep at night if I drink any sort of tea (even nestea) after 6, Pixel 8 provides the bubble tea without the tea (bubble juice, if you will), at no extra cost.  All in all, it's a great place for lunch or a snack. If I ever feel the need for ramen or noodles, I'm coming here."}
{"text":"I had a really poor experience with Pixel 8 Lounge, and I definitely will not be going back again.   Went in there for a table of 2 on a Sunday afternoon. I was quickly given a table to sit, but NOTHING (menu, tea, placement) was given to us after 5 minutes of waiting at the table. There were only 2 waitresses there, and finally when I waved one of them over, she asked \"are you ready to order?\" Um.. no, because you have not given me a menu yet.   Ok, so I ordered the Japanese curry chicken rice bowl, a cold lemon tea and my friend ordered chicken wings and french fries.   Even after a few minutes we ordered, still no tea and no cutlery were given. I had to wave them over again and ask for tea.   For a HK style cafe, I don't really expect much with service.... but this place was really below average. After waiting for 30 minutes, our food still not arrived. I noticed the tables around us, whom all came after me all got their food and drinks.  I asked where is my drink (again, 30 min wait) and she replies they are making it - no one was at the bar. Then FINALLY our food comes, but they got the wrong order. Instead of chicken wings, they gave us deep fried fish cutlet. Since we've waited for so long, we just decided to keep it.  My Japanese style curry rice bowl came and it tasted horrible. It was not \"Japanese-style\" at all. The curry was a spicy bitter taste, and the chicken skin was mushy and just really disgusting. It was so salty and spicy, and my drink was STILL not here yet - after 45 minutes now.  Finally, my drink comes but we were both finished eating our horrible food and I asked for the bill.   When the girl takes my credit card, she goes \"the machine automatically charges tips.\" I have never heard of a machine that did that.. and when I looked over the total amount, clearly she had just rounded up the amount herself and the machine did not calculate the tax based on a percentage.  BEWARE! What a scam.. never coming back here even if the food was free."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for the last six years and I'm beyond being a satisfied customer! My favorite place in the area and their prices are beyond reasonable ^^) I always get the ramen lunch and weekend special for under $6"}
{"text":"Had the Ramen and it was okay not as authenice as the specific Ramen places across town. The soup is not bad and the ramen was good. Comes with free bubble tea as well in the combo.  But was I charged extra but I do not remember what it was for.  Also had the deep fried ice-cream which was amazing.  You can select your own ice-cream flavor.  I tried the black seasme and it is pretty big so I advise you share it with someone."}
{"text":"Food isn't that great... also very expensive $8 for some fish balls... and crap. Much rather eat Ajisen ramen than this!!  I also saw the waitress clean the toilets and not wash her hands and serve food.  Not very appetizing and very unhygenic. YUCK!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend absolutely LOVES this place and their ramen. He rather come here than go dt for kenzo. The ramen noodles are a lot thicker here and are a bit more texturized , which is what ramen is supposed to be like, not just soggy instant  mushy noodles.  We usually come here on weekday nights or even weekend evenings, those are hands down the best times to go. Servers are friendly and very very quick. Sit down and order and your food is out in less than 5 minutes. HOWEVER, my boyfriend and I came here today which was a Sunday afternoon and hooolyyy this place was packed! Waited quite a while for our food and drinks. But food quality was the same and service was still decent especially for being so heavily understaffed. I would suggest avoiding this place early in the afternoon, during the weekday LOTS of high schoolers from PET and during the weekend just tons and tons of people."}
{"text":"Been visiting this place on and off for years. Menu doesn't change much or at all. Food quality is decent and is not always consistent. I've tried most of their items on the menu and I have to say the stone bowl noodle soup and deep fried scallops are the best. This noodle soup is a daily \"special\", I guess - Not in price, but in how you want to order it. You get to choose the soup base, type of noodle, 3 toppings minimum (beef, tofu, mushroom, imitation crab meat etc) and a choice of a hot or cold drink (nothing fancy.. Iced green tea or hot).  Thing to stay away from: RAMEN! :)"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite ramen places to date. Not because their ramen is particularly good, but because I went here for lunch on a regular basis in high school. I guess you can say that this place is nostalgic to me.   Their lunch items are quick and cheap, starting at $4.99 per entrée and they come with a drink. If you want to add tapioca or flavours to your drink, you have to pay a bit more. My favourite lunch item is the Japanese pork cutlet ramen, which comes with a dipping sauce. The ramen itself is thicker than most others, but that's half the appeal. There aren't a whole lot of fixings in the lunch items other than corn and mushroom (other than whatever protein you choose ; beef balls, pork cutlet....). Their dinner entrées cost slightly more, but it also comes with ice cream. They also have deep fried ice cream which is super unique and delicious. A bit of an indulgence.   The servers remember me and greet me warmly whenever I swing by for take out or a sit down. I've heard people complain about the service, but I've never had a problem with them."}
{"text":"Great place for a late night snack or quick lunch. Menu is affordable and fairly diverse.  The environment is fairly clean and the waitresses are moderately nice. They can get a quite feisty from what I've heard if you don't tip them at least 10%. Service time is quick and the food is decent.  I had the Noodle Hotpot, a Lychee Bubble Tea, and a Mango Ice Cream Crepe. All three items were well-prepared and came within 15 minutes.  I didn't notice the Cash Only sign when entering so I had to head over to the Bank half a block away to grab some cash when I wanted to pay. Other than that one blunder, I had a very positive dining experience. Nothing that would keep me away from coming again but nothing outstanding either."}
{"text":"wow the RAMEN here is horrible and their menu mainly consist of a lot of ramen, the noodles is not authentic, it similar to instant noodles (or maybe it is!) the soup was pretty good, and the toppings depends on what you get on it.   the teriyaki chicken rice came with a bowl of huge rice and little chicken. nothing else, just rice and chicken, not enough teriyaki sauce and the rice was mushy.  The cold drinks came in a cute mason jar, but I would have to say that thier tapioca is a bit too soft also.  This place is really busy on sundays for lunch (i'm gussing a lot of people comes here after church)  the crepe used to be good, but they have change it a bit and there is less stuff on it. the deep fried ice cream is not good at all, please pass."}

Including Deep Fried Sesame Ice Cream."}
{"text":"Environment is pretty well designed for that area. The food was average, nothing too special for udon and bento box sets, it came out rather cold. I came here for lunch and I thought the service was terrible. After paying, I've left enough for a 10% tip before taxes, the waitress actually had the gut to tell with a straight unfriendly face, \"that's not enough\" and made me fidget for 25cents. If, in the case, I actually made a mistake, she could have said it much nicer. However, i was POSITIVE that i left enough for tips."}
{"text":"Pixel 8 lounge has gotten a lot better than what it used to be when I used to be in high school. Since this place is right beside the PETHS plaza, there are always high school kids here. I'd say avoid at all costs during the weekdays, especially during lunch and after school.. it gets rowdy and clearly the workers are done with everything and everyone, and it shows in the way they start to treat people. I remember coming here all the time back in the day during high school to grab a cheap meal.   I usually come on the weekends now, because it's a pretty good deal and the food isn't half bad either. I always get the satay beef ramen and although it's not super saucy like I had first expected it to be, it's still very good with texturized noodles. It's a bit salty though so I always get the iced green tea that comes with it. The noodles are very thick and texturized and I think that's why I like it a lot. They are a lot friendlier on the weekends and always smile/talk compared to the weekdays where they have to deal with pubescent boys and girls. I get it.   I've yet to try the fried ice cream though.. from the pics, it looks SO good!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has very good food although the portions are way larger for dinner than it is for lunch. It seems like the waitresses aren't particularly fond of the high school students that eat there during lunch but they are very polite during dinner.   My only concern is the cleanliness especially around summer time. I was there for lunch and there were 3 large cockroaches running up the wall behind my boyfriends head. Once my friend found a dead cockroach mixed in with his seaweed, another time there was in just there in his ramen.  Also, once a cockroach ran across our table and we screamed, the waitress laughed, squashed the cockroach and left without taking the dead cockroach with it!  I come here often because it's convenient and the food is great. Their drinks are delicious!   For lunch I perfer \"Japanese Pork Cutlet with ramen\", for dinner \"shrimp tempura ramen\" and my favourite drink there is their passion fruit greentea!  If you're only going for drinks, make sure you check out their 2.99 daily special. Just beware of COCKROACHES! It seems like less of a problem in the winter."}
{"text":"There has been so much development in the Markham area... and I'm not too fond of it because I enjoy the large greenery that I call home... None the less, everyone's buying and building and I can only be thankful that there are so many food options less than 5 minutes from my parent's house.  My friends suggested going to Pixel 8.. the interior literally looked like an IKEA furnished place... orange and plastic looking, I don't know if it was supposed to be cool, or just cheap. Closing in on 10pm, there was a late night menu where the big ball of deep fried ice cream HAD to be ordered. I love black sesame ice cream so how could I refuse.... sounded good anyway. I don't really know how deep fried ice cream is supposed to correctly look, as there are so many ways that people do them. This one however, is \"deepfried\" in rice crisps like cereal.. not really deepfried at all. I was so surprised that the sesame ice cream did not have an obvious taste to it, rather very bland. For those who have eaten ice cream at an AYCE... the black sesame ice cream is STRONG, similar to the taste of black sesame bubbletea.... this did not taste like that.  The ramen looked good and a few random teas were also ordered.... Service wasn't that great although I wasn't expecting anything to begin with. There are several TVs playing asian movies. With all the competition in the surrounding area, I would try something else before coming back."}
{"text":"This is the first time in this restaurant. Order couple of noodles and it was very acceptable. The server are friendly. The bowl was large enough to fill you up. It's a little bit on a pricey side comparing to Chinese noodles restaurant but very acceptable."}
{"text":"Pixel 8 Lounge is a small Hong Kong style restaurant located in the Berzy area in Markham on Kennedy Rd north of 16th Avenue.  It's one of a dozen or so other restaurants in a small L shaped plaza with ample parking free available.  Having dined here several times I have grown accustom to the black and white decor and orange seating, bench on one side, chair on the other.  Several flat screen TVs play chinese shows or movies, giving this place a homey feel.  Seating for approximately 60 people this venue offers simple and affordable Chinese and Japanese style meals with a variety beverages. Alcohol is available but the specialty here is the wide range of hot and cold tea flavours. Some are presented in strange glass containers with suspended leaves or petals. I haven't tried all bit the most tame cold sweet teas so your mileage may vary.  Try the jasmine cold sweet tea.  I usually get a noodle soups such as the Japanese Ramen or Yumamato Ramen.  They are slight variations of the same theme: hot soup, ramen (looks like instant noodles but thicker and more hearty), some type of veggie (like a bokchoy and corn) and some meats (fish ball slices, ham, etc.).  It's very tasty, filling and comforting.  All for around $5-6 at lunch, it's simple, good eats.  Although I have only given it 3 stars, I do so because as a whole the restaurant is not exception.  It's solid, decent HK-style food that I will likely return to sample again."}
{"text":"I don't patronize drink places often, so my opinion is not a very well informed one, relatively.  I guess Pixel 8 is okay.  The decor is simple, and it has a student feel.  The prices are comparable to other drink places, I guess.  The coffee is expensive, however.  We ordered a Colombian coffee.  We swore it was a Nescafe instant coffee with evaporated milk.  We were charged $2.50 plus tax for it.  At that price, I expect a freshly brewed coffee."}
{"text":"There's something I like about the ramen in this place that makes me always want to go back. The soup is average at best, but it's the ramen that always gets me.  The prices, as mentioned already, are dirt cheap, and even dirt cheaper if you go for the combos and such. Free dessert and free drink (well...sort of free) in most combos that they offer.  Service is average, and the noise can get a little high at times. When they first opened, they play some disco balls after 10pm; dunno if they still do now. Best part about it though is FREE WI-FI!!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite ramen place! I know the ramen tastes like instant noodle and the broth probably isn't as fancy as Kinton but it just tastes good! Their selection of toppings for the ramen isn't the best but for the price you pay, I'm very satisfied with the food. The interior of the restaurants is somewhat rundown and the washrooms are very tiny. However, the waitresses there are very friendly and they're patient with all my questions."}
{"text":"Hours have changed. Sign shows closes at 11pm pretty much everyday.  However i went at 10 and they already weren't excepting new comers! disappointing that their hours can't be relied upon.  a must try there is deep fried ice cream! - have yet to find another place that has this since the other place that did have now closed down--the noodle house at commerce gate."}
{"text":"I hardly give out a 4/5 rating  The food is GREAT. I really recomend coming over. The service is near perfect and the time to make the food and serve it is NEVER over 6 minutes. The only ting i dont like is how small the drinks are. As a larger person like me, a small cup with green tea isnt gonna really quench my thirst but thats only a small part of this review.  All in all, i love this place :)"}
{"text":"I love this place! I come here for dinner and I order the pork cutlet ramen! The portion is good and the red curry is amazing if you order the spiciest level!! The bubble tea and other drinks are also just as amazing! My favorite place for ramen!!"}
{"text":"This place has been around for a while; a neighborhood restaurant. Having said, don't expect anything overly fancy like the other ramen places popping up everywhere now. However, it's not such a huge disappointment like many of the other reviews say. True say it doesn't live up to the ramen standards nowadays, but if you want a simple ramen fix yet still tastes decent and without the line up, this place isn't too bad. Just remember, CASH ONLY.  Their menus changed recently (at least from my visit last week). A lot of items have been removed, including my usual. However, the waitress acknowledged that order and asked the kitchen to make it anyway, which I thought was nice of them. The one thing I like about their ramen is the texture - it's really chewy but tough. The unique thing about this place though is their bubble tea. It's a lot creamier and sweeter because they use condensed milk which you can really taste, with a hint of tea flavour. It's something different than the chains out there.  The price is decent with just a bit leaning towards the pricier side now, but until then I'll still visit."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my friend because she's a regular and close with the workers, but was kind of disappointed! :(  Everything was going fine and the servers were friendly. I ordered the chicken teriyaki ramen noodle (#33) and the chicken came first and then the noodles. I was about to dig in to the chicken before it was taken away from me and placed at another table!  The lady apparently had some mix up with another table and decided to just take away my food. So yea, was kind of mad but my chicken came 5 minutes after.  Taste wise, average. Nothing too special. I really like their tea though! Filled with high school students, so it's pretty noisy there.  Wouldn't come here on purpose just to eat but not a bad place if you want to chill with friends. But the unorganized and unprofessional service really needs improvement!"}
{"text":"Pixel 8 Lounge is suppose to be a Japanese noodle joint, a lounge and tea house that serves Japanese Ramen and Taiwanese Tea.   I went there for lunch on a snowy Friday... I kind of expected the place will be quite quiet and I can just relax and eat my noodles... hmmmmmmm   When I opened the door and walked in, the place is practically full! Full of teens from the high schools closed by... yelling at each other at top of their voices.. The noise level was so so unbearable, I always want to turn around and leave... But being a brave yelper, I decide to stay and sit with all these underage kids and enjoy my lunch.   I have to say the prices here is dirt cheap! $4.99 for a Ramen plus a Taiwanese style iced green/black tea!! I decide to splurge a little and order the Ramen with selections of 3 items ($6.99) and changed my soup base to EXTRA EXTRA spicy (0.99 surcharge).   My tea arrived pretty fast, I am surprise that it is sizable! Not too sweet, with a taste of honey... Perfect combination for my spicy noodle.   Spicy Noodles I love Spicy Noodles! Hmmmm, so perfect.. the only place I been to recently that made it spicy enough for me! The noodles are quite good, nice and chewy. However, next time I will stay away from the dumplings and other fried items... those tasted like something that they put in the microwave first have it defrosted and then cook together with the noodles. The enoki mushroom is good with the broth!   BTW, those teens left in the middle of my meal.. but more and more came in... I would suggest stay away from lunch hour during weekdays. I can see why the high school kids like to hang around here, cheap lunch, ok food, free wifi....and walking distance from schools around the area!   The staffs are nice and friendly.   Cash Only!   Alcohol serves after 4 pm."}
{"text":"I'm kind of sad to see this place has closed down.. So many good memories during high school where my lunches were spent. I think I went last year.   They had a good run, they were in a great area, the only downfall of this place was after the convenience store in the plaza closed there wasn't really a ATM around and they didn't accept debit. I know that there's a TD on either ends of Bur Oak but unless you had cash you wouldn't be eating here.  Enjoyed it while it lasted!"}
{"text":"This is a good place to eat if you're a student who has recently recieved solid Chinese New Year cash flow or if you're planning a huge carb load. Service is pretty crap, but the waitresses do remember their recurring customers (aka me, at least twice a week for four years straight) You'd better tip and you'd better tip hard, because these women will hunt you."}
{"text":"Inexpensive for a quick lunch, the ramen is quite tasty and the drink that comes with it is quite nice. Avoid week days because it will be quite busy from the nearby highschool. 4/5"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what Pixels is supposed to be in terms of cuisine, sort of Japanese ramen with a mix of other Japanese foods, Taiwanese bubble teas, drinks and mashed potatoes and steak.    Pixel 8 lounge has a good flow of customers (asian), in fact by the time my group finished, there were a few parties waiting to be seated.  We ordered some ribs which were very tasty and smothered in a sweet spicy sauce.  My cousin ordered the steak and potatoes which came with a salad and tomato soup.  The size of the steak was huge.  The surface area was probably 1.5 of my head.  The ramen noodles were unfortunately not that great although they have cool combination such as  a rack of lamb with ramen, volcano ramen etc.     Most of their dishes come with a drink.  If you want a specialty drink you have to pay more.  I ordered the honey green tea which was very refreshing.    Loud Chinese channel playing in the background."}
