{"text":"Don't get the nachos. $12 with guacamole and it looked exactly like the nachos bell grande at taco bell, just with out the meat and 3 times more expensive. They also took 45 minutes to come out, and arrived cold, soggy, and disgusting. I can make my own store bought chips with canned cheese flavored sauce much faster and for much less money. I would have much preferred taco bell. When the waitress came to give us our checks I told her and she responded with \"I wish you would have told me sooner\", meanwhile that was the first time she came to our table or was visible since taking our order. Slow and somewhat unfriendly service, bad food. There was barely anyone in the entire restaurant and I am not hard to please. My friend did have the chicken tortilla soup, and that was very good."}
{"text":"I have to start by saying that the first time we went there, the food and drinks were mixed up and service was horrible. So the manager gave us two 20$ gift cards. Our family wanted to go there again, so we did. The food took 45 minutes to come out, and someone had to wait another 10 minutes for their food, it was blackened and horrible. We asked for another one, and it took another 20 minutes. Some of the games were not working. When we tried to use the gift cards, the manager said there was nothing on the card. He was not the person that gave us the cards. We asked for him, but he never came. The only thing keeping me from viewing this as 0 stars was the waitress. She was very nice. We will not be THINKING of coming back here."}
{"text":"Food is so so. My burger was  burnt. Served cold fries.  Ordered a sandwich and was later told they didn't have all the ingredients. My friend said her pizza was good.  It is unusually loud and slightly obnoxious. Don't expect to be able to talk to your table mates. This evening... The \"club\" was bumping. Football and basketball games were on......and they had dueling \"pianos\" who unfortunately were not that good. I'd pass on this place."}
{"text":"Food is little pricey but good. The thing that gets me is the service is slow even when they are not crowed. I've tried a couple of different visits to give them a chance but it seems to be getting worse. 

If you don't mind waiting awhile for service this isn't a bad place to eat and grab some drinks. But with the numerous restaurants now in downtown Kent I recommend giving them a try first as other locations are quicker with their service."}
{"text":"Went to Panini's today for lunch with a friend.  The restaurant was clean and service was good.  I got one of the overstuffed sandwiches (pastrami) which is their signature item, and it was OK; I thought the fries on the sandwich were much better than the rest of the sandwich.  We also got chips and salsa as a starter, but the salsa had no heat to it at all, it was essentially fresh tomato.  The food was OK and the prices were reasonable, but nothing was above average."}
{"text":"Wings were bloody, burger was over cooked, soggy fries. Had a similar experience in prior visit. If you are looking for good bar food go across the street to cleats."}
{"text":"Overpriced. $2.49 for pop and $2.23 for beer. 
Waitress in the back bar more concerned about closing instead of sitting more customers.

Food was great though."}
{"text":"Had really good service. Love the food, the salad was a very good portion size and very tasty.  A good number of TV's so you can find the game you want at a good angle."}
{"text":"Friday at noon... four people in the place and it takes 25 mins and counting to get a panini?  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Panini's never fails to get the job done. Food is always as expected. Service is great. All the ladies do a spectacular job."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Waited forever for a rude server. Ended up leaving. Not worth the stop."}
{"text":"I was visiting and was told that Panini's was the place to go for great sandwiches.  Amanda, our server, helped me choose their most popular, Cheese Steak Panini.  It was completely BLAND.  There was absolutely no flavor in their meat or their coleslaw.  M boyfriend's Pastrami was definitely better and their Wings were delicious.  Price was great and the atmosphere was quiet, but we were there around 11:30pm as well."}
{"text":"As long as you're not trying to have lunch on a extra crowded Friday, this is a pretty nice spot."}
{"text":"I ordered a burger with bacon, onion rings, and barbecue sauce. It was pretty good, although my pretzel bun was mysteriously greasy. The sauce wasn't too sweet, but you could taste it enough that it made a difference. Their fries were alright too. Don't order any appetizers unless you're by yourself, though, because we had 4 people and could hardly split two appitizers (pizza strip things and fried pickles.) There were only 4 strips, about three inches long, and 10-15 pickles! I felt like it was a bit of a waste. But the normal food was fine, and I was full before I could even eat everything. Would definitely go back, but wouldn't order appetizers."}
{"text":"In general our service here has never been great. Not horrible but not too great either.

Today we sat outside at about 7:00 on a Sunday. The music was cranked up reasonably loud  and we asked if it could be turned down just a bit. I watched our waitress ask another employee who asked twice who had asked and then, seeing us said to our waitress, \"Well, I'll just turn it up.\"

Which she did. If I find out her name I'll post it here.

The one star review was saved because the very friendly manager came by, asked us a routine, \"everything okay?\" question and lowered it to a reasonable level. He didn't seem too concerned about what idiot employee had done that, however. Perhaps he's stuck with that."}
{"text":"This place has really gone down hill since I've been here. The service has been worse and worse. My food has come out cold the last 3 times I've been there. They have a nice patio though.  Overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times, but I'm back and forth on this place. I have had both good and bad experiences. Sometimes the food is good, although service can be a little slow. Dined in a couple weeks ago, just myself and a friend. They weren't busy, but our food took at least 30 minutes. I didn't have any complaints about the food though, so the wait wasn't a big deal.
But then sometimes, the food is just bad. Ordered take out a few days ago including an order of boneless wings. I bit into the first wing and it wasn't fully cooked. Disgusting! I was completely grossed out that I wasn't in the mood to eat anything after that. I did end up getting some vouchers to make up for it."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, comes out fast and the waitstaff was prompt and friendly. The price was also a great deal! It cost $10 for a pizza, and $7.25 for two shots of whiskey. We were on a 24+ hour road trip and wanted dinner to go for the rest of the ride, and I found this place on Road Ninja and ordered take out. The hostess said about 25 minutes and we were there in 15 and it was ready to go. We were in and out with paying and a drink within 10 minutes. I'd definitely suggest this place!"}
{"text":"Worst Service and BIGGEST Attitudes ever! My thing is, if one is rude to customers than they should not be working in customer service and the food industry period! Especially if you are the Manager!!! It's funny because they got my order wrong not once, but twice and didn't even have the decency to say we apologize for the inconvenience or thank you for your patience or simply a thank you! And then they give you the biggest attitudes and say unnecessary comments when IT WAS CLEARLY THEIR FAULT!! Definitely will not come back and please do yourselves a favor and go to a different location to avoid the headache because clearly these people have major issues!"}
{"text":"The service during lunch time was horrendously slow when I recently went there. The food on the menu is decent if you're looking for a quick bite and it's in the neighborhood. However, I'd consider a few other options locally next time until the patio's open in the summer."}
{"text":"Stopped in after work with my husband fora  quick bite and a few drinks. Staff was very friendly and food was good. 
Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Our first clue that this might be a good place for dinner was the parking lot.  There was NO parking anywhere and all the retail establishments close to Panini's had \"No Parking, Panini's customers will be towed\".   The atmosphere was fun, and there was plenty going on to keep my one year old grandson occupied and entertained while we enjoyed the delicious food and drink.    We ate inside, but the outside patio had live music (Thurs nite) and looked like it would have been a fun choice too."}
{"text":"The waitress was really nice and made sure we were doing well! The food was also very good (we had pizza, soups, pretzels, and more). The wait time was alright, but nothing to be upset about. Overall it was a good experience and I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"Good bar food. We'll be back to watch sporting events and sit on the patio"}
{"text":"Took our kids and grandson here on a Sat night early, 5:30, as a second choice in the area and was terribly disappointed.  Although seated quickly, everything's went downhill after that.
Slow service in spite they were not busy.
All the hot food came out together but my d in law had to wait 5+ minutes for her salad and then later had to ask for the garlic bread she ordered.  My sons sandwich was OK but cold fries.  My Buffalo chicken was boring and almost tasteless served on a very weak pretzel roll.  The wings were chewy and just OK.
Saving grace was the 2 year old loved his grilled cheese.
Needless to say, won't be back."}
{"text":"This is a restaurant and bar that has all it needs to be THE sports bar in the area, but it falls short. It's a pet peeve of min to stand at the \"wait here to be seated\" as employees walk past without a word. The wait staff is also slow to get drink orders. 

The food is good, but sometimes comes to the table a little on the cool side. There is also issues now and then with the entree beating the appetizer to the table.  Also of note, if you aren't looking to have an adult beverage, is the seeming inability of the is place to serve a diet cola. They have it, but you'll either get get a glass cola syrup and tap water, or a glass of soda water with next to no flavoring. More frustrating is that when brought to our waitress's attention we got one bad pop after another. 

There is nothing here that can't be fixed, but I think I'll be steering clear for a while."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night after landing late from Chicago..the service was aweful and the chicken was barely warm and this place was dead! No excuse for such lousy service or food! And where was the Buffalo sauce..after all its what I ordered!"}
{"text":"By far the nicest Panini's I have been to in the Cleveland area.  It was snowing like crazy, but that outside patio must be awesome in the Summer.  We went this past Saturday night for the NFL playoff games and the place was jammed.  The four of us had a couple beers at their sidebar while waiting for our table.  After we got settled in with drinks I thought to myself, \"How are they going to find us?\"  The don't call names over the PA nor do they hand out the electronic zappers.  This annoyed all of us as we needed to check back every 15 minutes or so with the hostess.  They would make it easier for everyone if they had some better form of communication.  No big deal though.

On a positive note, they have TV's everywhere.  There wasn't a spot in that place where you couldn't see the game.  Definite Plus.  I had the boneless Buffalo Parm wings which were packed with flavor.  For my meal I had the Panini Burger which also hit the spot.  I was stuffed!  My burger came to the table about 4 minutes later than everyone elses food.  She told me it was off my bill and was very sorry for the problem.  I wasn't bent out of shape and all, and it was nice that they took care of it the professional way.  

Overall, even with the mistake I will go back for sure.   Great place to watch the game or hang out.  See you there!"}
{"text":"Went last night with a large group including kids. The place is decorated awesome for Halloween. Our service was great. The food came out fast and was delicious.  We love this place and will be back."}
{"text":"Seems like a bar/restaurant.... but they turn off the music and pretty much kick you out by 11:30, so... not really sure.  I'd be more concerned about why the bar is empty on a Saturday night instead of influencing people to leave."}
{"text":"Bartenders are great! Anthony has happened to be our bartender most times and crystal once and I will say they are the reason we come back. Can't beat the service! Food is excellent with a great atmosphere. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Had the pizza.  They had to bring it out three times before getting it right. It was ok but something bitter in there.  Service indifferent at best."}
{"text":"Went there last Saturday and never actually ate. We had 5 young adults and my wife and I. Since we had so many kids I called ahead to see what the current wait time was.  
The young lady on the phone said they did not take call ahead seating.  I tried to explain to her several times in several different ways that I just wanted to know the  current wait time. She clearly didn't get it. (Poor training)   Finally I had to ask if I was standing right in front of you right now could you seat a party of 7.  She said yes but was like pulling teeth to get this answer.  

We arrived within 8 minutes of that call. When we arrived the young female hostess said they could not seat us.  They said the only way they could seat us was if they split us up. We asked if someone had come in since the time we called and the girl first said no then started to make up a story.  

Then she said the real reason they could not seat us was that they were going to start clearing tables to make room for the band and it would be a 90 minute wait for a table. 

This was ridiculous. Clearly they new when I called seating could be an issue but they were reluctant to tell me this over the phone. It sounded to me like they have been coached not to tell people about seating issues because the management want to pack as many sardines as they can into the tiny establishment.  

As long as I live in the area I will NEVER GO BACK."}
{"text":"I was there Saturday night 9/27.  I ordered a Sicilian burger and upgraded to french fries.  The fries came out raw, soggy and cold.  The burger was also cold.  The waitress was not around to speak to about this problem so I pushed the uneaten plate to the edge of the table with all of the food on it.  The server never came back to check on us except for 1 time that she asked my wife if she wanted another drink--but ignored the uneaten food at the table. When the bill was brought out--I told the server about the terrible food as I was paying the bill becasue that was the first time we could really communicate with her.  She got very apologetic and said they would prepare the order again in a to go box, but I told her not to bother-it wasn't worth it to try this terrible food again-and I had my coat on and was on my way out the door.  I paid the whole bill and tipped the waitress, but i will be a long time before I ever come back.  Terrible Experience."}
{"text":"Yeah, it's a \"chain-ish\" kinda place, but there is no better vegan panini in town!  The friendly guy in the back with the tats, he knows exactly how to do it and has never disappointed - from the right mix of grilled vegetables down to the non-buttered but toasted bread!  Just be sure not to sit under that giant-ass fan....it will make you dizzy/nauseated as it slowly spins overhead..."}
{"text":"Very rude staff. I recently placed an order online, as we found it via the website that directs you through a third party company that will deliver local food to you. The website didn't state which Panini's it would come from, but thinking that I live in Strongsville, it would be this one. I called to confirm the order and the girl that answered the phone was very rude, just kept repeating that they didn't take online orders. So I simply asked her to check for an order under my name, upon which she then put me on hold for about 4 minutes until another girl got on the phone to repeat the same information very rudely as well. This is no way business should be treated, especially over the phone.

Anytime we have went into this restaurant, the service is very poor and the staff is not friendly, in face they look as though they are in pain to be working there. If you are planning to go to Panini's make the extra drive of 3-4 miles and head down to the nice one in Brunswick!"}
{"text":"Gave this place a second try after they annouced it was under new management. We started out with a happy hour priced spinach artichoke dip which wasn't very good, it was soaked in butter and garlic. There was acutally a pool of butter and garlic in the dip. The beer was warm and the entrees were below average at best. Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"The food was good and service was good.  Had to wait for a table about 30min.  But it was a apatient Friday evenig.  Bellied up to the bar and had no problem to sit and have a cold one after a long week!  It was a was a great experience."}
{"text":"Lexi the bartender the night of the mayweather fight was the bitchiest rudest bartender I have ever met. I was sober and couple of my friends were lightly drinking and I have never met someone that rude exp someone the relies on tips. I have been a bartender since I was 21 and now 24 and the nerve of this girl was insane! I would personally like to speak to management or someone over this girl! She deserves to be fired and learn how to deal with people. Can someone please contact me?"}
{"text":"Second time here and the kitchen is still slow. Took an hour to get our food. First time here was an absolute catastrophe I won't even go into. This location does not hold up to the Panonis standard we've come to expect."}
{"text":"After traveling on the 90 for seven hours we decided to try Panini's for a quick stop. My husband ordered a pizza.  I decided to try the Perch Fish Fry special. When my dinner arrived everything on the plate looked totally over cooked. The four fillets were hard as rock. The French fries were dark and soggy - Probably from the bottom of the fryer.  When the waitress returned and asked if we needed anything, I told her a new meal.  She apologized. She promptly brought the manager over and she apologized for the meal too. I was offered a new meal but decided to share my husband's pizza. The manager asked if I would like a salad. I said ok.  The pizza and salad were mediocre.  Yes, my experience was a disappointment.  Next time we will try somewhere else."}
{"text":"I live near by this restaurant with my family. We will frequent at least once a week either by take out or dinning in.  The food is good,  it is for the most part your typical bar food.  Awesome over stuff sandwich, also a nice wide variety of items.  Dining in the servers are good friendly and helpful.  Food will come out of the kitchen hot and typically on time whether the place is busy or slow. Getting take out on the other hand is a different story.  The hostess staff that pack to go orders couldn't pack a to go order correctly with no mistakes or forgetting a dressing or sauces if there lives depended on it. I would say that out of the last 10 take out orders we've gotten from this place maybe 1 of those times the order was completely put together with nothing missing or the order taken correctly.  I would honestly give the dining in experience, food, bar staff and servers a 4 out of 5 , i would give there take out and hostees a 1.5 out of 5.  Overall eatting in is the better option, though if you do take out expect your take out order to be missing something or something to be messed up."}
{"text":"Our favorite bar in the summer time! The patio is great with plenty of room at the bar and at tables. They have enough TVs for everyone to be able to enjoy and always have a great selection of beer. We have our favorite bartenders on Thursdays! They always remember what we drink and are always so fun to be around! I love the Italian sub with the hand cut fries and the mobster pizza! Keep it up we love you guys!"}
{"text":"Had a burger and it was fantastic - only complaint was the shredded lettuce was falling all over my lap. For a party of six the server was quick on a busy Friday evening so we could get to the show in time!
When can we go back again?"}
{"text":"the overstuffed sandwich is not to be missed.  corned beef was excellent!  Service was a bit slow but we did have a large party.  atmosphere was great at Christmas."}
{"text":"Wrong take out order. So frustrating that even though the phone ordertaker repeated the order back correctly, it was completely wrong. Eggplant parm with no cheese, missing side salad - ordered a patty melt and got a BLT. Not even close. Wasted gas running back and forth to get mediocre food. 2nd bad experience at this overpriced spot - won't be back a third time."}
{"text":"It is a bar & grill. Do not come in expecting the staff to kiss your ass.  Food is good and inexpensive.  Servers get the job done.  Ask for Brandi...she is sweet & smokin' hot!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, customer service, and outdoor vibe. Food is good as well. Plenty of TVs to watch your favorite games. Nice small college town with that Mid West swag. Waitresses were all super sweet and accommodating. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I live close to this Paninni's so I have been here many times. The food is great, the service is almost always great, and the beer selection is good. The new patio looks awesome. They added TVs so there isn't a seat in the house without a view of the game. My only gripe about it is that it's always, always super loud. You have to scream just so the person next to you can hear what you're saying. Definitely not a quiet family dining experience."}
{"text":"Came here on an afternoon. Service was decent; our waitress was friendly and attentive. However, the food was not. You would think they would serve actual paninis at a place called Panini's. The bread was dry Texas-sized wonderbread and not toasted or pressed like an actual panini. The only thing overstuffed in the panini were the fries, literally HALF the height of the sandwich. Our pretzel was dry and solid, like if it were left out since the morning. The soup tasted like it came straight out of a Campbell's can. Right after I ate the panini, I felt sick. One good thing? The food wasn't overly greasy. Maybe some of the other items on the menu are better tasting, but probably not going back there again if I could avoid it.

Atmosphere: good, clean, and not too crowded.

Bathrooms: Ew."}
{"text":"Remember back in the day when they let you in underage and you chugged your friends beer in the bathroom?

Or that Saint Patty's Day at 5 AM when you sang karaoke (Def Leppard) and chugged your beer - only to be escorted out by 7AM?

I do.  Mostly.  

Panini's was the fall back bar.  The one you went to so that all the younger friends could hang out.  It was the bar you went to before heading to Mugs and after Mugs to have one of those tasty sandwiches.  

Oh good, remember when you would eat french fries on your sandwich without thinking of the yoga class you should take the next day to burn those fabulous fried calories. And the coleslaw?  

Good times."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of Panini's.

The service is usually standard but has never been great.  That's not a deal breaker by itself, but the food is average at best.  Recently I got a sandwich that was a special.  It was grilled chicken, on toast, with spinach-artichoke dip as the sauce.  Sounded pretty interesting! Unfortunately, the chicken was overdone and the toast was nearly burnt.  Again, that alone isn't a deal breaker... but there have been several other times I remember not being satisfied with my wrap, or sandwich.

Panini's, Cleats, and Bilo's are all the same copy-and-paste, generic bar and grill.  They are also all right next to each other.  If you're looking for good service and food... of the three, try Cleat's.

Panini's does have a decent patio... so if it's a nice summer or spring day, the patio bar is pretty cool for some after work drinks with co-workers."}
{"text":"Nice enough place, but the service is consistently awful. If you plan on stopping in, plan on being there for at least an hour and a half, lunch or dinner, and plan on not seeing a server or your check in any sort of regular interval."}
{"text":"I get good service. The food is bar food...not very good but for the money  ok.  I go there somewhat regularly ... Enough that most bartenders know me.  And they get a crowd when they get a band.  I get it and ok with what it is.  It sounds like some of the customers expect more that it is."}
{"text":"Pretty sure this i smy new favorite bar in Kent. They did it much better this time around. Nothing like the old Panini's at the other end of town. Had a good beer selection. Good beer selection to me is Christmas beers on tap. Win Win."}
{"text":"Overstuffed sandwiches are very good.  Service was outstanding and the beer choices were plentiful.  Was getting together with a group of my college buddies before heading to an Indians game...this proved to be the highlight of the evening."}
{"text":"If you don't enjoy dining to the sounds of \"What Does the Fox Say\" and \"Call Me Maybe\" absolutely blasting, you may want to skip this place. This place is always deserted, even on weekends. The parking is horrendous, and I will never understand how their booths can be sooo awkward and uncomfortable to sit in. I always get the same thing because they have few vegan options, but I definitely recommend the Santa Fe wrap with no cheese and a black bean burger swapped out for the chicken."}
{"text":"I went there for the Sunday brunch. Very disappointed. On my server's suggestion, I ordered the \"Deconstructed Burrito.\" For a price of $12.50, the meal was mainly hash browns smothered with shredded cheese and sour cream (essentially I received cheesy fries for breakfast). When I complained to the manager that there were virtually no eggs or sausage in the burrito, she offered me $3 off the price. When I balked, she removed the item from the bill, which should have been done in the first place. I won't be returning to this restaurant"}
{"text":"Nice decor, nice waitress, nice patio, awful kitchen.   Food was wrong and painfully slow.   Waitress showed up 10 min after we were seated (it was busy).   Took the order right away at our request, then came back 10 min later and said the kitchen was holding all orders as they were overwhelmed.    15 minutes later she came back and said she put the order in.   Hooray!    45 minutes later we got our food.    A full hour and 20 minutes from table to food.   It was wrong, cold and generally poor quality.   I love paninis sandwiches but I'm never going to this one again.    The manager kindly paid for the meal without me even asking but not even close to worth it or ever trying it again."}
{"text":"This place is great to watch games.  The Waiters are cute and hard working.    Beware of ordering Mixed Drinks.   None of the bartenders are skilled.   You will get missing ingredients or short shots are common.  Stuck with the nice cold  draft beers.  Pizza is really good"}
{"text":"we recently had several lunches at work from Panini's (mostly salads and wraps).  The food I had didn't seem to suffer much for being take-out rather than dine-in.  They did consistently send too few sets of silverware."}
{"text":"Wow, what a disappointment. I remember the one in Kent being really good, as close as you can get to Primantis. This was so bad."}
{"text":"Wow is this place going downhill!  Have been her quite a few times in the past although not a regular.  Menu has changed and the salads leave a lot to be desired!  The black bean burger salad was a favorite of mine....no longer on the menu but you can add the black bean burger to any salad....NOT the same it was borderline mediocre!  The photo doesn't even look appetizing.  Not to mention the last few times we have been there they are out of a lot of the beers on the drink menu.  Too many really good places for food and drinks in Kent and beyond to waste time here.  Nice patio but not worth the sub par food and beer."}
{"text":"Great customer serivce, amazing boneless wings, and amazing fries! Great shots, beer, and TV's every where!!!  Love this place! Reasonable priced too."}
{"text":"Went there with some friends last night. From the outside it looked like a standard bar and grill, so i was hopeful we would at least get some good bar food. We ordered some cheese fries and onion rings for the table to start out with. In both cases they were competently made, however they included only the smallest thing of sauce for each. The women ordered some long island ice teas and margarita's. In both cases they felt they were mixed wrong and thought they used alcohol that was the bottom dollar cheapest possible. Many at our group, myself included, ordered the Panini they were supposedly famed for. I ordered a Pastrami Panini and got a huge sandwich with tons of filler and maybe two lunch meat thin slices of Pastrami on each half. Our server was named Brandi and she deserves her own special review. First off we came in at 9 in the eve and told her our party would be growing, which it did from 2 to 6 people, as the night progressed. By 9:30 our service had disappeared and, I'm not joking by 10:00 it was like we were in a ghost town, which is when they rung a last call bell for our section only. Apparently 5 minutes after we came in they started seating people on the patio. We were never politely offered an opportunity to move out there and every time Brandi came to our table she made smart mouth comments. For instance you wanted a second refill she would comment you must be floating away. By herself she ruined any hope of a halfway decent experience here. When I paid the bill in cash she gave me back my money with no coin change claiming that Panini did not give coin change back to it's customers. I normally tip 15-20% at most sit down restaurants. To be blunt the change was all she got and I felt that was a bit high in terms of the service offered. 
To sum up don't go here, but if for some reason desperation drives you to go to this ghastly place and you get Brandi as your waitress, demand any other waitress. Trust me, you can't do any worse."}
{"text":"Service was slow. The food wasn't that great. The server was nice but didn't seem to care we waited longer than everyone else to get our food. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"This place has excellent sandwiches. They are stuffed fat like they advertise and is the best I have found in the area."}
{"text":"Was there with 8 people in the after noon, service was good and food good,    Wings good, patty melt good, fish dinner fair, Margarita pizza good a lot of tv's hanging all over the walls. All toll it's a fair place."}
{"text":"So let me start by saying that all I have ever had at Panini's is the overstuffed sandwiches.  That is all my review is based on...I have never ordered anything else.

The Cappicola overstuffed is great.  They are a greasy mess but in a good way.  I like the fries and my wife seems to enjoy whatever she orders.

The service has always been decent and I really have no complaints, it isn't a 5 star restaurant but they do what they do competently."}
{"text":"As far as Panini's goes, this particular location could do better. The food is pretty solid - I mean c;mon... who doesn't love the Primanti Bros style panini sandwiches... but the service could do better.

The issue is the waitresses here - they really seem to have an attitude issue! Was waiting for 15 minutes before I was seated, and it felt like the waitress was doing us a favor.... we are the ones paying here! I would go to an alternate location if I could... but the food is pretty good..."}
{"text":"I first ate at a Panini's in 1996, in the Flats.  I liked their signature overstuffed sandwiches, which are pretty unique and really fill you up.  I've been to a lot of their locations as they've expanded over the years. 

I have been having lunch at the Mayfield Rd. location for a few years now, since 2011, but will never be going back to that location again after today unless someone gives me the apology that they owe.  

Here's what happened:  I walked in and sat down at the bar like I always do.  No one came over and greeted me.  

I waited several minutes, still nothing.  

I observed a few employees walking around, and figured that if I was patient soon one of them would come over, but no one ever did.  I couldn't understand why no one was coming over to serve me.  I waited several more minutes and still nothing, but three different waitresses were standing around by the kitchen entrance behind the bar, doing nothing, just staring blankly pretending not to see me.  They were looking right at me, so I tried to get their attention, first by craning my neck like I was looking for help, and then eventually I started waving my arms.  Not meekly, either, but like it was Day 15 on the lifeboat and I'd just spotted the first airplane since the ship went down.  Still nothing.  No sign of acknowledgement whatsoever, like I was totally invisible.

I've never been treated like that, anywhere, not ever.

After about thirty seconds of waving, I got up and walked out. I don't intend to go back again. I have no idea what their problem is, but they clearly have some serious issues with the staff. 

I tried to find a customer feedback contact on their web site, but there was nothing, so I'm taking my grievance public.

Update:  I did eventually get an apology from someone who works for Paninis, and a promise that their staff had gone through some turnover and they were making things better.  I have been back, and happily have gotten better service.  Accordingly, I've updated my rating from 1 Star to 3 Stars."}
{"text":"I ordered naked wings with sauce on the side. They wanted to charge me extra.. charge me extra for the cook to do less work? That is ridiculous. It saves the cook from having to dirty a bowl to toss the wings in. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Great for gatherings. Outside patio and bar are the best attractions. Food is good, reasonably priced, and the atmosphere is fun."}
{"text":"All in all I'd give it 3.5.
Went here with some friends, and this was a pretty standard sports bar. Lots of TVs, fair draft selection, which worked out perfectly as we all like craft beer and were planning to watch some playoff football. The menu covered a wide array of options, but not quite for a foodie either.
What earned it the extra half star is the Sunday special, $8.99 for a double bacon cheeseburger. The cheeseburger was good, nothing to write home about, but not disappointing either. Overall, for the price, and the hefty side of fries, you won't find a better bang for your buck than this special.
If we were out in the Concord area again, I wouldn't be opposed to coming back, but would probably be more interested in trying out some new places."}
{"text":"Eh.  I don't get the hype?  The sandwiches are just OK.  I've never felt the urge to eat here.  It's always someone else's idea LOL. Perhaps if the food was memorable..."}
{"text":"Brunch this morning with my hubby. The restaurant is gorgeous! The food excellent. The made to order omelets and crepes were hot, fresh and delicious. We didn't have any little ones with us but enjoyed watching The Balloon Man create magical balloon sculptures for the kids."}
{"text":"The food here was good the day I went but the wait was long compared to how many people was actually in the restaurant. I must say we had an outstanding waitress and the hostess and waitresses were also very nice. Great customer service which is very important. I will be back here more often."}
{"text":"I wouldn't even give this place a one star. The girls were so rude and acted like my friends and I didn't exist. November 28, 2015 was the date and they didn't even look at us. It's like we were ghosts: it was awful worst experience of my life. Was super slow."}
{"text":"I will never return here. The service was awful. The restaurant was not busy with only a few tables of people and the server was no where to be found. My boyfriend ordered boneless wings and I ordered a pizza for lunch. The server forgot to put in what kind of wings and gave him plain wings with sauce on the side. I was served a severely undercooked pizza. It was looked as if it was on lasagna dough and fell completely apart when I tried to get a slice. It was disgusting. 

Don't let this review stop you from eating at another Paninis. The one in Euclid and Willoughby are amazing and have never disappointed us."}
{"text":"M
Pretty lame.  Cheesesteak sandwich had little steak and even less cheese.  It should be called mushroom and bread sandwich with a garnish of dried beef.  My lunch including onion rings and iced tea was $17 including tax and tip.  Ripoff.

Would have given one star but the server was cute and it was a sunny day on the patio."}
{"text":"Seriously ridiculous service. Or lack of service. Stood at hostess desk for 20 minutes as several employees walked busy ignoring us. I walked inside to see several employees standing around doing nothing. Was told need to check in for patio at patio. Was then told it would be a 45 minute wait as I looked at no less than 5 empty tables and at least 7 employees standing around. 
I get it, you don't want my business so I'll help you out. 
I left. 
Horrible Horrible experience I won't be back. 
Shame too since I like their food."}
{"text":"There's only 4 or 5 letter to describe this place, but I'm going to use 4 this time. C.R.U.D. To be perfectly frank I don't know if this is the exact location I dined at but I was at the downtown location. I ordered a Panini (go figure). You would think their paninis would be pretty on point, considering. They. Are. Not. The bread tasted like brown rice. The rest of the meats and toppings did not compliment each other well at all. And the fries tasted like cold cardboard. So... Maybe this establishment should think about growing up a bit?"}
{"text":"Food is ok. Parking is ok on early Saturday night. The service is incredibly slow. 
Outdoor seating is fantastic weather permitting. 
I guess waiting for the food isn't so bad when you're outside."}
{"text":"Good Twinsburg bar! Paninis are not as good as DT but they have a fanatic patio, decent prices and always something going on. Great place for after work happy hour or keeping the night local."}
{"text":"The Paninis brand is predicated on food [PANINIS SANDWICH] after midnight. But on this Saturday night, the eve if Christmas Eve -- the kitchen be closed."}
{"text":"Bar area too small.  Food not good enough to be a restaurant.  OK on nice nights on patio, but chairs are uncomfortable. Last 3 times I've been there they seemed short staffed. Food took too long and was cold"}
{"text":"I am really sad that this outing turned out the way it did.  It had started out on a  good note.  We walked in and were quickly seated. Our drink order was placed and shortly after that our food order. And that's where it all started going down hill.  We wanted fried cheese - they were out. It took her a few times to read out order back correctly, and then it was almost 40 minutes before our food arrived...by way of another waitress and even more sadly the coleslaw I did not want near my plate was there and  very prominent next to my sandwich.  Luckily it did not contaminate my sandwich with its creamy yuckiness so I did no have to go into five year old mode and bitch that my sandwich was ruined.... but I would have. Because after 45 minutes and not seeing our waitress and then Miss Ray of Sunshine that delivered the food did not understand my fries were missing... and the sandwich was not to have coleslaw near it... I was truly about to lose it.  But I took a moment, our waitress arrived and behold HAD my fries AND apologized for not catching my plate with the offending coleslaw. OK, it's cool. My sister took it off for me just let me eat and life will be fine.  It was after she wandered off again I noticed my fries had more burned cheese than not but I just gave up.  
I thought after that paying the bill and getting out of there should have been easy. But no it just got even worse. They had over charged us for the food. Pannini's on Sunday are buy one get one half. They rang up 3 at full price and one at half off. They had not processed my credit card when I showed them the mistake but she did take it back with her where she finally got the ticket straight, ran it for the incorrect amount, then voided it THEN the correct amount!! It was mind numbing and it took an additional twenty minutes to get the bill settled.  OH and did I mention its 97 degrees out and they have no air in the place.  Tons of fans and none are on.  So by the time we left I was sweaty, had a splitting headache from the chaos of the food and check and can say that 4 days later I still look back at it, shake my head and say NOPE.  Never again."}
{"text":"Disappointed with how service, food and drinks have gone downhill. Went to Panini's last night and the experience was sub par. 

Nothing like ordering a premium beer and getting it in a plastic cup. 

Booth we sat in was filthy. When was the last time someone cleaned behind the red cushions? 

No drink menu at the booth when we sat down. 

Sandwiches were sub par as well. Perch fish was on the menu as Lake Erie perch but there was no way that was possible because the filets tasted frozen and were larger than any Lake Erie perch which are generally about 3 inches and these were closer to 6-7 inch filets. So that was misleading as that is typical of ocean perch. A bit disappointing because we have great fresh fish in our Great Lake and Panini's is selling frozen ocean perch. 

Waitresses seemed disinterested in everything. When we first walked in basically ignores us for the first minute with three women at the welcome desk. Then one even walked into me as we were standing there - I say walked into, but she pretty much 'checked' me because she wasn't looking where she was walking. Goofy to say the least. 

Won't be coming back any time soon. Nothing really special. Menu is too large. Quality and cleanliness is taking a dive and service is lackluster."}
{"text":"The food was fine but the service was something that ruined it for me.  I ordered a Lakefront New Grist bottled beer which was fine, price point was fine also.  The problem when it came to the food and the pricing of the food and answer I got about it.  I ordered the BBQ Chicken Wrap, I have included a picture of the menu item I ordered.  Like I mentioned food was fine but the menu item was not priced for what I got and the server stated that there was an up charge for bacon.  Menu item stated grilled chicken covered in BBQ w/cheddar, bacon & onion straws in a wrap with fries.  I got a Wrap for $8.79, fries for $0.99 and bacon \"add-on\" for $0.99...which equals $10.77.  Slightly higher then the advertised menu price of $8.99.  This will be my last time here.  Server: Kristina & Cashier: Mercy."}
{"text":"Imminent closure.



The worst. Arrived before sunset. Service was crazy slow, we didn't have drinks until 20 minutes after ordering them. Food was horrible, actually got sick after eating there. Don't think it was a coincidence. Cooked food didn't look appealing or taste like much. Left in the dark. Wouldn't think of coming here again."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches but
As a former flats employee 
This has got to
be the worst kitchen
Super slow
Bartenders and wait staff could careless about you 
Real disappointed in the service here
Sub-par 

I Just know this is not how this is supposed to run"}
{"text":"The service here is not very good. If you're eating at a table, rather than the bar, your waitress will be sure to ignore you. The food is overpriced and leaves much to be desired, unless you go on Working Women's Wednesday. For some reason, the free appetizer buffet is generally pretty good. 
The place is good for a night of dancing. On some nights, there is a guy that takes requests in the Pub, live music in Panini's, and a DJ out on the patio. It can get pretty packed."}
{"text":"Waited outside patio at bar for half hour.   Asked at front if okay to sit anywhere for dinner.   Not one server came anywhere near us even though there were at least 10 people working on a quiet Sunday night at 7pm.   Great location and patio.   With no manager present it is an utter joke for Service."}
{"text":"So I recently moved here from Athens back in 2002 when I was 6. Been living in Twinsburg ever since and it's an alright place. The high school is sub par but hey, what are you going to do. Graduated from the THS back in 2014. Had alright grades and was accepted to ferris state university. In Michigan. Like if I held up my hand in the shape of a mitten (that's what Michigan looks like) it would be like half way up. I'm currently a sophomore there and am getting great grades!! Home for the holidays and hanging out with lots of great friends. I even rekindled a few friendships. All in all it has been a good life for me so far. Had my ups and downs but knowing that my friends and family are always going to be there for me is what gets me out of bed every morning and puts a smile on my face. The food here is alright."}
{"text":"Very slow service, even though she was nice, but we did explain we were on a time schedule....of 1.5 hours.  Still SLOOOOWWW.  The food is okay, not stellar.  
Great lookin' patio, so maybe I'll be back in the warmer weather & provide better stars."}
{"text":"Just for the Record: Panini's did not invent the Primanti brothers sandwich. I heard some Cleveland person saying that the other day. And several people around him agreed.  As a pittsburgh native, its important to get all records straight.  

The food?  the food is good. I love the chili with the Jalapenos, cheese and onions.  I love the Caesar salad- great dressing.  They are like a local TGIF or Ruby Tuesdays.  They have a great Reuben too.  

But. It needed said.  Primanti Bros is a pittsburgh tradition. Fries, Coleslaw on a sandwich was invented there. No where else."}
{"text":"Nice setup here with a couple different bars and they also have outdoor seating (in nicer weather). The staff is always good - you never see anyone standing around. I really haven't had any of the sandwiches, but I love the pizza here.

The only thing that is a bummer lately is the last three times I have been in there (and my visits were spaced apart), there are three women in their 40's that sit at the corner of the bar and drink like crazy. Hey - no problem, I'm all for having fun, but these woman are SO loud and they are swearing up a storm the entire time. They think they're funny and it's really just obnoxious. There were kids in the restaurant and the language is a little over the top. When we were there, one of the bartenders came up to us and said \"I hate when they're here... and they're here every night.\"

So, if you go, say hi to the drunks at the corner of the bar... but for me, I think I'll stay away until the management does something about it."}
{"text":"Always a great place to watch the game.   The wait staff seem to hustle around.     Lots of TV's"}
{"text":"My mom and I stopped here to grab a light bite to eat on a late afternoon, but early happy hour. This bar and grill  is located off of Mayfield Rd. and it's far enough from the street so that you won't hear the busy traffic. 

The restaurant is very spacious and the booths are quite large (maybe too large) and they have a patio. Prices here are reasonable and the restrooms are CLEAN (thank goodness) and the air freshener smelled awesome (seriously). 

We ordered the sampler that included chicken fingers, onion rings, fried cheese and potato skins. Tasty yet typical-it wasn't nothing to brag about. My mom ordered the creamy broccoli and cheese soup, but wasn't able to finish due to it being waaaaaaay too salty! 

Our waitress was sweet and did make sure she checked up on us often."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of Panini's, but their AMAZING patio is worth the 4 stars alone.

Otherwise you can expect the same gut busting sammiches, and deep fried menu found at all other locations."}
{"text":"same ol same ol... every time they build a new paninis, they get further from what I want them to be.  Think the flats in the late 90's, the one in the warehouse district or gateway paninis, something with a little character... you're a filthy sandwich shop that sells beer and most people LOVE that.  Stop straying from what made you cool in the first place!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Waited 30 mins to be served, only to have our order screwed up because the servers don't feel it necessary to take orders on a notebook, just by memory. The food we did receive was cold. Ordered a drink and it was extremely watered down. Have no idea our waitresses name as she did not introduce herself when she finally came to take our order. An hour passes and we get some of our food, and the rest of the order was forgotten and not made. Never ever would I recommend this restraunt. Too bad because the patio is lovely. But I'd rather go to a crummy looking restraunt with good service than a beautiful looking one with lousy service.  Waitress did apologize but said it was \"just so busy\". 2 in the afternoon. Tip : management learn how to staff better, and make your staff write orders down vs just going on memory. Seriously we were only 2 people. What happens when a table of 5 comes in and you go by memory?"}
{"text":"Had a blast here Saturday night! Love the loud, high energy music by the Dj. Great place to party with friends! I'm looking forward to coming back and having dinner too : )"}
{"text":"Very good food at reasonable prices with decently fast service. Would highly recommend this place for a night out with the guys or even a family restaurant. They have a ton of TVs inside and a great outdoor bar and seating area!"}
{"text":"I used to work in Kent, so I've been to Panini's a number of times. It's pretty much exactly what one would expect from a sports bar chain. Decent selection of beers, lots of TVs and menu with a wide variety of things one might crave. Quality of menu items varies -- you're best to stick with bar food basics and avoid anything that should require inspiration to be good.

That said, it's telling to pull this place up on Yelp and see not a single review above 3 stars, try not a single response from management. This kind of presentation leads potential customers to surmise that either the place is going downhill, or management simply doesn't care. Neither of which is good.

Nutshell version: Go knowing that your mileage may vary. Keep expectations low and you might be pleasantly surprised -- but if you go in expecting a terrific experience, you're likely to leave unimpressed."}
{"text":"Ok food poor service the two downtown are so much better the wait is always very long for everything and it's not even really a bar very disappointed in this spot I love the one on 9th Street"}
{"text":"Panini's has a large menu and the food is very good for the most part. The menu includes burgers, wraps, salads, appetizers, desserts, and so on (it will take awhile to read)
I think the month and time in which you go will affect your experience. If you sit inside usually around dinner time, the restaurant will seem crowded--but fun. If you want a more relaxed experience, I recommend going in the summer and sitting on their patio. The patio has a nice atmosphere with TVs, a small bar, and a waterfall"}
{"text":"Great place for pizza & wings and so much more. Lots of TVs for any game and a great patio in the summer. Lenny is the best bartender in the area!"}
{"text":"These guys make one of my favorite sandwiches here in the area. But out of all the different restaurants that they have, for some reason the service really stinks here. The patio is kind of a waste too, since the view is the freeway and the noise is unpleasant. I will still go here from time to time for their amazing sandwiches loaded with fries and coleslaw, though!"}
{"text":"It's been a year or two since my wife and I visited this place. Since that time we've noticed a definite decline both in service and the general appearance of the location. For example when we walked in there were several employees just standing about and we had to almost beg to be seated as they were engaged in their own conversations oblivious to us. 

We were seated at a table outside that was dirty and had an obvious broken umbrella that drooped. We went back to the station and had to interrupt the employees from their internal conversation and asked to be reseated.

The food and service once we were seated was pretty close to what we remembered from this place. However we will probably not be going back as the general staff seems not to care and the general appearance of the restaurant has gone downhill. There are much better options in Kent. Owners beware of your staff....if might explain why the place was half full at 8 on a Saturday nite. Just sayin..."}
{"text":"A beautiful Sunday evening around 7:30 pm so hoped to dine on the patio. The sign at the rear/southeast entrance to the patio said to wait to be seated. The sign at the empty hostess station said the same. The place was busy but not packed. After going unacknowledged for three full minutes & FIVE passing employees, we walked."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I really like their wings and some of their other food.  

However, I went in today to find out they don't have the Sunday ticket anymore....   I'm a fan of another football team besides the Browns and always came here last year to watch.  This year we cannot do that.  We will start going to another place to watch this season.  I feel like any sports bar should have Sunday ticket!"}
{"text":"Good service and a nice atmosphere. A lot of TV's all on sports. Had the pulled pork tacos. Really good. I upgraded to the onion rings. It was a good choice. Yummy!  My wife had the triple grilled cheese. Also really good."}
{"text":"To the lady bartender rocking the beanie tonight: I'm not sure what I did to deserve the scolding I got on three separate occasions for a miscommunication about my order. You made me feel unwelcome at paninis. Please learn to show some respect."}
{"text":"Friendly atmosphere, prices are fair, food is good. What more could a person want?"}
{"text":"Sat out on the patio. It was crowded. Slow service, dirty dishes everywhere. Mediocre food. Out of several draft beers. Not cheap. 

Two stars may be a gift. Not sure why it was so crowded. Big parking lot?"}
{"text":"This is the first time I've been to this establishment in a number of years. I remember eating here back in the day whenever the building was first built. Then I would always get the over stuffed sandwichs and they were prime time. This time around I wasnt really that hungry so I just got an app. And I'm going to be honest, I haven't gotten it yet but I bet it'll be good. I haven't really been waiting that long but I just got bored and decided to write the review now. I went to school with the waitress. She was alright I guess. Just got my food now. I was right. It is good."}
{"text":"This was our 3rd and final trip to Panini's. First time was ok, wanted to try a new place. Second time, wanted outdoor dining. Third, heard about free arcade games. All three were basic bar food, small portions for the higher price and okay service. Not sure if it was because we are a family vs. College kids/sports fans who drink lots of beer and spend $$$$? It is no longer on our list of places in Kent for dinner."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! This place is like heaven for my stomach! My absolute favorite place to eat when visiting my in-laws! The service was exceptional tonight! The hostess was so pleasant and polite! Food smelt so good I began eating it in the car! My husband and I live in Kansas, and we visit a few times a year. Panini's is so good, I consider visiting more often just to stop by and get some yummy food! #absolutefavoriteplaceintheworld"}
{"text":"This is a good Panini's location, plenty of parking, nice outdoor seats and great food. Sometimes the service is a bit slow, the only reason I docked a star. The price is good for what you get. The Capicola Overstuffed Panini is great. Add a fried egg, it's worth the buck."}
{"text":"This place is the WORST!!! I went here on a Sunday to watch football. My husband and I seated ourselves and waited at the table for 15 minutes and still no one came to greet us. My husband flagged a waitress down and asked her can we place an order. She asked was anyone helping us (stupid question because if someone was helping us he wouldn't have went out of his way to get her attention) and we replied no. She took our order and told us that she would send the person who was going to be our waitress to us shortly. We then sat at the table for 25 minutes and here comes our waitress to tell me that they were out of burgers so I would have to replace it with something else. I changed my order without complaining even though I was pissed because it took forever for her to let me know this. Another 20 minutes passed and she asked if we needed anything so I asked her how much longer would it take to get our meals. She said any minute now and it took another 15 minutes. The food is at best mediocre...definitely nothing to go crazy over. Our waitress came back a couple more times and when we were done with our food she brought us our check and we never saw her again. The game we went there to watch was over and we looked for her so we could pay and leave, but she was nowhere to be found. After waiting for a few more minutes my husband yet again flagged down another waitress and asked her could she take care of it for us because our waitress is nowhere to be found and she said sorry, she couldn't but she would get our waitress for us. We waited a few more minutes and still nothing so I went up to that same waitress and said \"we are trying to checkout so we can leave but if no one can do it for us we're ok with just leaving without paying!\" She took my card and gave it to her manager to cash us out. The manager came to the table and gave the most insincere apology ever! I've never gone to a restaurant and didn't leave a tip but today changed that! The only tip I gave was advice on how to have better customer service!!! The food is not good, the service absolutely sucks, and they ran out of certain foods and budlight on a Sunday during football season smh! This was my second time there and I didn't like it the first time and absolutely hated it the second time. No way will I go back and I wish I didn't have to give this awful place a star!!! I don't see how anyone can like this place!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first round of the NCAA tournament, horrible experience. Ohio State was playing at Noon and they were completely understaffed. Who would have thought the local favorite team playing on one of the best sports days of the year would have brought a crowd? Second strike, no one in the building knew how to work the tv's properly. If you are a sports bar, it should be easy for someone to handle 4 games on 4 different stations. You would have thought we were asking to split the atom by trying to get different games on.

Besides this experience, I've been to this bar several times. Food is the worst of any Paninis I've been too, the service is usually hit or miss. The patio in the summer is the only redeeming quality of the place."}
{"text":"Panini's  food is just ok.  It's five stars when your drunk or when you sit outside on the patio and no hillbilly's  are smoking.  I wish they ordered a more healthier menu and didn't allow smoking on there patio."}
{"text":"Panini's is the bomb. OMG. Just arrived here 2 hrs ago and my buddy Pat brought me here for. Panini's overstuffed sandwich. I'm so full. This place is phenomenal. We ate at noon and it's 4 now and I'm nowhere near hungry. Great Cleveland decor. This is a pretty awesome place. . Go Panini's"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times, but last night was the first time in about a year. We arrived with a group of 6 around 6pm and were seated right away. They have a nice patio, but we opted to sit inside and watch the cavs pregame. They have a decent amount of TVs so this is a great place to watch some football, basketball of baseball. 

Our server was nice, but the wait for food and drinks was a little long. This always seems to be a consistent issue at this location. The food is average, nothing to rave about, but for $7-9 for entrees you really can't beat the price. We all got a variety of different items includes fish tacos, turkey club wrap, cordon Blu sandwich, and an Asian chicken salad so there's something for everyone."}
{"text":"We are frequent customers. But once my tip was misread as $100 instead of $10.00. It was processed as $100. Since we are there so frequently, I still wonder why they couldn't hold the ticket for us for the next week. Still kind of pissed about this. They KNEW we weren't tipping $100.00!!"}
{"text":"Got turned away because we needed a high chair for my son and they only had larger tables open, and the host was \"not allowed\" to seat a party of three at a six-top. Terrible customer service."}
{"text":"Walking in the patio was half-full of families dining for lunch. It looked like it was getting decent business so we stopped to check it out. There were four people at the host station and we patiently waited to be greeted and seated. The inside was near empty, almost void of any patrons at all. Eventually I interrupted the employees' conversation and asked if we were supposed to seat ourselves. Good thing I did because that seemed to be the first time they noticed us standing there, right next to them. Our host slapped a couple of menus on a table and walked away, I assumed we were supposed to sit there so there we sat.

To speed things up a bit, we went ahead and ordered our drinks and food when our server made it to our table. We sat and enjoyed watching the employees talk amongst themselves at the host station. We ordered pulled pork tacos with fries and it arrived at the table in about 20 minutes.

The tacos were good but not great. The fries, well I didn't care for the fries. They were very dark, almost black which was not appealing. They tasted perhaps slightly overdone. Our server definitely noticed my distaste and checked on our table. A minute later an apparent manager also checked on the table. After a quick scan of another table's plate of fries I chose not to complain. I don't think it was an error on their part. I think that's just how fries are served here. 

All in all the food was worth the price and I had no issues with the bill. If asked by friends, I wouldn't recommend this place for lunch service."}
{"text":"Just an update...wife kids and I went to Paninis for some grub...cold prompt beers.  Kids drinks refilled promptly.  Had a grilled chicken salad...hot where it needed to be...salad was cool and crisp.

Wife had a panini...I finished it for her.  Not much to say but glad they have it figured out.

Note back bar isn't open on weekdays."}
{"text":"Fun place, service is excellent, however, food is missing flavor ... the quantity and price is good but the taste can be improved .. good luck"}
{"text":"Great place to catch a game and grab a few apps and beers. 

Stopped in on a Friday evening during the third quarter of playoff basketball so naturally it was packed. We waited for 30 minutes for a seat but it wasn't an issue since you can see a TV no matter where you are in the restaurant. 

Service was quick, the food was pretty good and the beer was cold."}
{"text":"Arrived before dinner time. Not busy at all. We waited around an hour possibly more for our food. At this time they were still not busy.  Our waitress visited our table 4 times, to get our drink orders, take food orders, gave one of us a refill and lastly to give us our check. Food was cold. Salad came out same time as dinner entree. And the wings we ordered were cold and down a few. For a first time experience, not a good first impression."}
{"text":"Went there lunch break. Waited an hour for a grilled cheese panini and fries. Fries were soggy, sandwich just okay. Wait staff was friendly and apologetic for the wait; however, I'll never go back."}
{"text":"Great looking sports bar.  They're overstuffed sandwiches are pretty good.
Servers were very nice.  Lots of tv's throughout the restaurant. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I went with my family for the Sunday brunch this past weekend. It's all you can eat, so of course we got our money's worth. They had a buffet spread of waffles, hash browns, biscuits & sausage gravy, french toast, bacon, eggs, sausage, pastries, etc.  We went at 11 a.m. and it was pretty quiet. There was absolutely no line or crowded around the buffet.

The waitress was very attentive and gave us a crepe and omelette menu that are made to order and brought to your table. Since it was all you can eat I ordered an omelette AND crepe. They had a Bloody Mary bar set up near the buffet too that had everything imaginable you could stick in the drink from bacon to cajun seasoning.

They had a guy walking around doing balloon animals (I guess he's there every Sunday) and my son got this awesome dinosaur balloon animal. 

10/10 would recommend and go again."}
{"text":"Stay away.  The food was horrible.  Greasy, luke warm fries.  An extremely overcooked dried out burger.  You could see where the cook pressed down on the burger because they were annoyed by something. The fish tacos were basically fish sticks stuffed in stale taco shells covered in cole slaw. The waitperson was nice and I was happy about the beer - though the keg was empty half-way through my glass.  Kent has lots of other bar/restaurant options.  I urge you to try them out."}
{"text":"The famous panini sandwiches are a little bland but good size for the $. Wings aren't bad either."}
{"text":"Panini's is a restaurant that our family has enjoyed going to over the years and that ends now.  We went in July and everything was terrible.  Our service was SO slow, half of the order was wrong, the food that did come out wasn't warm, and then we were charged for the food we got that we didn't order.  We left extremely disappointed and frustrated.  Fast forward to today - we decided to give it another chance - bad choice.  The restaurant was quite empty but again we waited quite some time to even place our order and then we waited a good 40 minutes for our food to arrive.  Some food was warm some was cold.  The sauce on the wings wasn't correct. We then had to wait forever for our waitress to bring the bill.  Fool me once shame on you... fool me twice shame on me... there will not be a third time.  Will be taking our business somewhere else in town."}
{"text":"First off-- this location is an amazing setup.  Our sever mentioned to us that the owners put at least a million dollars into gutting and remodeling the restaurant, and you can definitely tell.  We went for the Sunday brunch around 10:30am this past Sunday and were impressed!  The buffet is only 12.99 for adults and is all you can eat.  There was a wide selection of hot foods like bacon, sausage, biscuits and gravy, waffles, and french toast.  They also offered a made to order crepe and omelette station.  In addition, they had a selection of fruit, as well as pastries, etc.  We loved the affordability and variety.  You definitely get a \"bang for your buck.\"  Our only negative is that we thought they could improve upon their pasty selection.  They had a lot of cookies, cupcakes, danishes, etc. that were store bought from a package (enteman's danishes, lofthouse cookies, target mini cupcakes, etc.)  It also would be nice to offer one or two \"lunch\" selections during the brunch hour.  Our server was also friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"We will give this a 4 star. BUT, it's only because we really enjoyed our thin crust Mobster pizza. It was $13 and in my opinion was outrageous but was tasty.   The floors throughout were sticky so what's the kitchen like?  The wait staff cannot stop touching their hair. Whatever happened to hairnets or ball caps?  Well try it again but we can only give a place two chances. After that, it goes on the list."}
{"text":"I am hoping this place will remain a solid 4 for me or possibly increase. We just moved to the area and have been here about 8 times. We love the outside bar however currently it's not open during the week. I am praying that changes with the seasons.  We came here the first Friday of March Madness and literally got the last table. It was extremely loud but that was due to the festival and parties. 

Let's get to the food/drinks. Beer is always cold. Pizza is good and is the special on Mon night.  Happy hour they have $5 apps (minus nachos) - even on Sunday.  

Bartenders are friendly BUT I would suggest to management that if you managers have time to chit chat with the bartenders, you have time to make eye contact with clients at the least."}
{"text":"Love the garlic Parmesan wings; they're the best ever. Also the thin crust white artichoke chicken our favorite.  Always perfect."}
{"text":"don't think i've ever seen such poor rating! my first visit after reopen was 'meh' but returned recently and liked it. place was pretty busy with a very diverse clientele. some of the people, including the bartenders, were actually easy on the eyes, which is almost unheard of on the far west side of cleveland, but was nice to experience. draft great lakes session ipa was just $2.50 and my chix club w/huge side of fries was just $8.99. i will gladly go back."}
{"text":"First of all I was really excited to go here because I was really in the mood for a burger, and I knew this place had lots to choose from. As we are being seated I looked around to my delight to see massive delicious burgers that people were enjoying. I ordered a drink which got warm at the bar, but other than that the service was great. Looking through the menu I finally made a decision on a burger, the panini boy, going against my friends advice who is building his own, i'm figuring if they named this one after the restaurant it must be good. When the plates came out my friend was the first to get his burger and it looked awesome really big good size all the toppings look great and then placed in front of me was what looked like a small big Mac. I was in shock. I seriously thought it was a joke and was looking around for a Camera something. But I hate to be a bother, so I just reluctantly ate it thinking maybe it's better than it looks, it was not... This burger was seriously no better than a big Mac but yet double the cost. most pathetic excuse for a burger at a sitdown restaurant I have ever seen . Everyone else seemed to enjoy their meal but never have I spent $60 and left someplace so disappointed. Gave two stars because at least they have a decent beer selection. Give it a try, but unless you are an easy to please small child, get something other than the panini boy!"}
{"text":"Show me a Panini's without an amateur jersey shore cast and I'll show you an Italian that says his mother can't cook. This place is a pretentious Applebee's. The beer selection is monotonous and the food is a distant cousin of a hot pocket. 
Yes, there is a patio. It overlooks an asphalt parking lot and other commercial chains. Like many other Panini's, the crowd is full of faux- tanned breeders and women that got lost in their 20's circa 1999. The service is okay, but you'll be sitting in your seat distracted by the thoughts of why you even came to this generic bar. Do your self a favor and visit a near by dive bar."}
{"text":"Horrible service and mediocre food. Tuesday at 9:15, less than 20% full, and we waited 40 minutes for a sandwich, apps, and wings. 

The sandwich would be ok if they toasted the bread.  Instead it's a sqishy mess. 

I don't think we'll be back."}
{"text":"We went on a CAVS playoff night during the week. Called ahead and asked if there were tables available. They said yes, so we arrived 10min later. We were seated right away. Busy, but not packed by any means. Sat for 10min wondering if we had a waitress. Finally showed, took drink orders and they arrived, now 20 min into it, gave food order.  Then we sat, and sat, and sat. At 50min I asked waitress what is the update as tables around us who arrived after us were getting food-she snapped, told me to talk to the manager. I said, ok-bring manager over. Food arrived before manager.  I tipped waitress $20 on a $33 order out of an act of kindness because she was trying. The snap was hopefully just the overwhelmed moment."}
{"text":"Stopped by here a couple nights ago to watch some colleagues play a league sand volleyball game. Enjoyed a couple beers and an \"overstuffed\" sandwich while I watched. The sandwich was loaded with meat (I think I got capicola and pastrami) and french fries. I'm not a big plain white bread fan, but it was still pretty tasty. The outdoor patio is huge and festive. Definitely have to go back some time on a better day (rained part of this visit). 

One caveat to this review is that my entire experience was on the patio; not sure what the inside dining experience is like."}
{"text":"I'm assuming if you're reading this you've never been to Panini's or you're bored in the shitter (like me).  It's Panini's.  If you've ever been to a Panini's, you'll be happy.  Yes, they have Panini's on the menu.  They're great.  The service is fine.  I have a 5 and 2 yr old - high chairs aren't broken and kids menu actually has a few more choices than most (my youngest especially likes the mandarin oranges).

If you've never been to a Panini's, it's a local NE Ohio bar chain noted for their \"Overstuffed Sandwiches\", meaning meat (turkey, ham, or whatever) + cole slaw and fries mashed in between Texas toast.  See Primaniti Brothers if you're from the Burgh. Decent draft beer selection. Lots of TVs for games. Outdoor patio bar. Golden Tee, Pop-a-Shot, etc"}
{"text":"It's really a bummer because the atmosphere of the place is great, clean awesome viewing for sports events. But the food every time I have been there is old cold reheated forgotten from the staff. Service is slow and terrible. The staff sits and talks to each other instead of helping the customers. Multiple times the beer taste off because I imagine dirty taps. Just a poorly managed place that use to be fantastic."}
{"text":"Another Yelp-recommended lunch stop on our road trip that did not disappoint. Easy off and on to Interstate 90, but be advised that it's after the shopping center, you don't have to go through and behind it as your GPS might suggest.

Fast efficient service, and the food was very good. They have an \"overstuffed\" sandwich that has the french fries and coleslaw stuffed inside. My son ordered it, against my advice, and it was huge. He ate the whole thing and said it was delicious. 

The wait staff are all beautiful young girls, all very efficient and polite, but none of them seemed very happy. It occurred to me that this establishment does not appear to employee any males or anyone who is over 25 or less than attractive. Maybe whoever decided there would be no men and no unattractive or older women employed here might be better off concerning themselves with their employees attitudes than their proportions. If you can make them all wear skin tight stretchy jeans with sequins on the butt, you can probably get them to smile and chat up the customers just a tiny bit. I was with my son and we were tired from days on the road, we would much rather have a less attractive older waitress or waiter who was cheerful and friendly. I was considering withholding a star for the cold attitude of our waitress, but then I decided against it. After all, she was really hot...."}
{"text":"Great place to go with a group of all ages.  Good food, love the salads. We have always had good servers, willing to stand and talk.  Nice clean, fun place."}
{"text":"We called ahead, asked if dogs on patio are ok. They said yes. We drive over sit on bar and are told dogs are not allowed and we need to leave. No offer for take out just get out. The manager then chose to inform hostess what an idiot she was. This place is a waste of time and the manager was rude to us and her employee. 

Funny thing is if the dog was \"service dog\" then it's okay but an 8 week puppy crashed out is not."}
{"text":"Try the Mobster pizza. White garlic sauce w capicola, pepperoni, salami & banana peppers. Awesome."}
{"text":"Please ban cell phones for hostesses and waitresses.  This review is purely based on that statement.  Several that I could see were on their phones at one time or another while people waited to be seated, waited to place an order or waited for food to be delivered.  

Four tables that I could see were empty with dishes and glasses on the tables long after people left.  Did I mention cell phones?  Do your job please.  And texting isn't it.  

The part that bugs me is we enjoy coming here as wings are always good, and other food is as well.  Service issues need to be addressed big time!"}
{"text":"Service is decent but I got wings to go. They were raw and barely cooked. Will not be back."}
{"text":"panini's recently moved into the old panorama location on detroit and clague. i stopped in for lunch; noticing the cute little patio they had set up, we decided to sit outside. there was just one problem. we couldn't find a hostess to seat us. we stood at the hostess podium for 10-15 minutes, being totally ignored by all of the waitstaff and the bartender. finally, the hostess showed up - only to tell us it would be a 15 minute wait (even though there are open tables.) umm.. okay.

so, we sat inside. the table was dirty, and there were families with small children around us. enough said. all hostess issues aside, the food was good (we all got overstuffed sandwiches,) and our server was really sweet to us even though we were clearly disgruntled. that being said, i'd give them another chance."}
{"text":"If you have no other afterhours options, but still want to hang out with the drunkards after the bars close...look no further.  This place stays open serving food until about 3 or so...but its full of hammered drunks.  Awesome.  

The food is great, cheap, and filling.  Plus you can look at good looking people....even maybe strike up a conversation."}
{"text":"Good food, decent ambience, just not a place that really exudes great food. The panini is ok, the other food is as well.

While the food is good, I feel that this is more a bar first, one that serves beer and sports over really good food.

I don't mind the place, but not on my list of great places to eat."}
{"text":"My reviews are based on my working restaraunt  knowledge of front of the house and back of the house . I call Em' like I see them.

So my family and I found Panini's as we traveled thru Northern Ohio Memorial Day weekend visiting relatives at cemeteries.

Lunch time, greeted by a smiling hostess and were seated immediately.
Server, professional, curteous, yet very personable was taking drink orders within 5 minutes, we also ordered Fried Pickles.
Drinks came, she took main order and dhortly after Pickles arrived. Right after last pickle eaten, sandwiches arrived. This alone deserves a fourth star.

Fantastic service, Well Done.

The Fried Pickles were perfect."}
{"text":"The waitress Peyton got very snippy with my family and i. We got ignored the whole entire time. Food was t that great. They weren't even that busy. And we had to wait forever for our food. In fact so long that our food was cold the time it was brought out"}
{"text":"I don't see what the big fuss is with Panini's.  To me, they're just like Winking Lizard, minus the beer selection.  The only time I like their sandwiches is after 2 a.m.   I went to this location a couple times during the summer.  The patio is awesome, but it's leftover from M.Bistro.  It was fun to watch the Brown's game and the place had a good vibe, but those sandwiches...oh those sandwiches...ugh.  Compared to Primanti Brothers in Pittsburgh or even the Moosehead Tavern version, they just don't compare.  Dry bread, dry fries, dry everything.  Also, my friend and I were kind of ignored until a guy in our group joined us up at the bar.  Then the pretty bar tenders came over."}
{"text":"I have never had a good experience at this Panini's.   Bartenders are awful and slow.  Sometimes there seem to be 4 bartenders behind the bar and you still wait 5 minutes before getting their attention.  This to me is unacceptable!  Waitresses never know the current beer selection.  I've had a waitress come back to my table two times after ordering a beer from the menu only to be told they didn't have that beer.  Again, unacceptable!  I tried speaking to a manager (who refused to give me his name).  He basically shrugged it off and made me feel like if I didn't like it there, I should just leave.  I was appalled!  I will never go back there!  By the way, this final experience was on a Saturday night around 9:30.  The place was completely dead except for one table of 6.  Shame on the owners for hiring such incompetent staff!!!"}
{"text":"Yumm!! My favorite go to place in Kent or when I'm in Cleveland.  The service here is great and the waitresses are friendly.  I am usually seated right away unless it's later in the evening on the weekend.  My favorite is the grilled chicken sandwich on 9 grain bread.  The prices here are great for the quality of the food!"}
{"text":"Here is a update: The service is still slow. The food still isn't as good as other Paninis. And I'm still puzzled as to why I continue to return."}
{"text":"New menu is worth checking out.  Lots of new items, haven't been disappointed yet.  Service still needs a lot of work.  Not very attentive.  Blonde bar manager thinks it's okay to gossip and ignore customers at front of bar.  She's been a problem as long as I can remember.  Still -  for a casual and laid back bar it's a go to."}
{"text":"Great service, good prices, food is average at best. One item for cinco de mayo? People go because they have lots of tvs and the outdoor bar, not because good is good"}
{"text":"hello foodies  , sorry for the  late reviews  anyway I WANTED to eat a corned beef sandwich before st patrick day  ( day before ) so i took my beatfuil mother here as well we got there around 530 pm  we got the rubens (8 oz) that the standard weight , BUT SINCE I LOVE CORNED BEEF  ,.i got a extra 4 oz  added to both of the sandwich  (12 oz ruben WOW ) it was so tender  the meat  perfectly stacked in layers ,and the bread excellenly toasted to perfection  i had a gree n beer ,the beer was the freshest of any bar ,and it was  COLD !!!!!!!! temperture  not like semi  cold beer from a tap ,this was excellent  place to go   we had the bartender with the blonde hair  very pretty  she was very nice handle the food and the beer and she seems quite  nice  and she cared  , i would be back when i  getmore money  ,i heard  they have woderful corned beef everday of the year  that top of the moring to you  ,the noise level was a little hecked  and the lighting should be a little brighter   ,the booths where very roomy  that will hold a big and tall person  take care"}
{"text":"Hard to get what you're paying for here. Overpriced beer and drinks, poor service lately, and tonight I paid about $10 for a salad that was missing 1/3 of the ingredients with no warning from the server that they were out of the things it was missing. No wonder I only come here once in a blue moon... So many better options in town for a beer, apps, a sandwich, or salad and a good game experience."}
{"text":"I drive past this place every day on my way to and from work. My wife and I decided to try it since the recent remodel, the patio is all they have going for them. When we arrived we were told there was a wait. We went to the bar to get a drink and saw 4 open tables. Waited 15 minutes only to be seated at one of the tables that was open when we arrived. I thought that was strange. Ordered nachos with shredded cheese instead of queso. They didn't melt the cheese. I ordered a panini, the meat looked anything but appetising. The sandwich was cold. Service was slow and it really wasn't busy. We won't be back. I now understand why this place keeps going under and changing ownership."}
{"text":"On this recent Sunday afternoon with only a couple of tables in the restaurant. We were a large table of 14. It took over an hour to have our order taken. And another hour to receive out food. When we finally got served, we were all served at different times. I had the overstuffed cheesesteak sandwich. The meat was dry and the sandwich was absolutely tasteless. Very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"The food was five star but the service pulled it down to a generous three star rating.  We decided to get a bite to eat before going to Northfield to bet on some horses. The restaurant itself was the nicest Pannini's we've been to. Very nicely laid out with plenty of indoor seating and a spacious outdoor patio. The problem began when one of the THREE teenage girls at the door seated us. After 10 minutes, I asked the girls, \"So, is this a self-serve place?\" After that, instead of just taking our drink order, one of the girls wandered around the back to find us a server. Our server was great once she knew we were seated. 
To the owners - it sends a bad message to have three teenagers with their sour faces, checking their phones constantly, and doing nothing else. As my wife says, \"If there's time to lean, there's time to clean.\" These girls, obviously, don't take pride in their jobs and could not have cared less that we were not getting waited on. 
I have to say that our food was exceptional, as always. Get rid of the angry ungrateful brats at the front door."}
{"text":"I came in at 3 to grab a bite and a Happy Hour beer. The prompt attention from the bartender was a great first impression. I knew about Panini's overstuffed sandwiches, but on recommendation, she told me about the new menu. I tried out the Corned Beef Smash Wrap with a side of macaroni and cheese and it, cliche-ely, did not disappoint. The mac-n-cheese stayed hot in its ceramic bowl and the wrap was a hearty one. Add the Happy Hour prices of $3.50 shots (any liquor!) and the $2.50 tall drafts, and we have a winner. I'm definitely coming back to this location again."}
{"text":"Kids portions are to small, service is poor.  French fries are greasy. Inside main bar is to warm and more a/c is needed.  New owners put money into the place. Bar food is ok, sandwiches are good."}
{"text":"Wing sauces need more variety, they're mostly bbq or buffalo. Add some Asian and Caribbean. And a hotness scale.

Also, show the local teams on your tvs. The majority of screens tonight we're tuned to swimming. Wtf."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the service and the time it to get our food-  not totally sure if it was the kitchen being slow or the waitress - to be fair we did have a group of 10-  4 adults 6 kids
We sat outside on patio - very nice -  
Got our drinks- ordered food - got the appetizer very quick- one of the kids got their food- 
20 minutes later next food came-  
Very slow - asked for steak sauce and mayo for steak sandwich. - 20 minutes later comes back and says they don't have steak sauce - and had to ask for mayo - 5 minutes later -- mayo arrives 
Waited for bill - waited - then came and asked how bill was to be split 20 minutes later. Bills arrive- 20 minutes later returns  with credit card receipt - 
Seated 12:40pm -  left at 2:50pm 
We did order in shifts - but should never take this long a place that really wasn't busy-  
We were here yesterday and service and food were great- -   Dropped over $200 in two days and it will be a long time till we return!!"}
{"text":"Decided to take a ride to eat here kind of a spur of the moment idea. 
   When we walked in we were seated right away. Not sure if the air was broke that day or they just didn't have the air on. As for service we said for about 6 min before someone came over to take our drink order because our waitress was to busy talking to the family behind us. 
    Hubby had wings and a philly cheese steak. He enjoyed the Philly steak sandwich. I ordered a burger with a fried egg and jalapeños with a spicy sauce. It was really delicious. So overall the trip here would have been 5 stars based on the food but as for service it didn't get much better after we waited for her to bring more beers. 
    We order the buffalo chicken dip and the dip was really good but the nachos were a little stale which could have been because it was so warm in there and the nachos might have been sitting out."}
{"text":"The service was good and the happy hour prices decent, but nothing extraordinary. The Panini's sandwich is probably worth trying, but you'd have to have a huge appetite to eat it. Someone I was eating with got one and I'd swear it was a foot tall! My food was solid, but it's not a place I'd come rushing back to."}
{"text":"Came here last week for lunch....waited 45 minutes for food. Food was below expectation. Made the mistake of trying again today... not as slow sat at bar not busy, bad sign, tender was more interested in his cell phone texting than waiting on me.   Not going back"}
{"text":"Went to watch some football game with my boyfriend probably on a Wednesday. Paninis had their 40 cent wing deal going on. Two words: BUFFALO PARM. One of my favorite flavors of wings at Paninis. YUM! Our friendly server also explained that paninis is getting a new menu in a couple of weeks. Very excited. Great place to hang out after work or before a game."}
{"text":"Awful experience. Went there on a date with my wife. Only 10 ppl at the bar- no one at tables. Server took our drink orders and we asked for 5 more minutes to look over the menu. TWENTY FIVE MINUTES later I finally got her attention away from the guys at the bar (had to wave my arms around) and she said she would be over in just a minute. TEN MINUTES LATER we went OVER to her and ask for our card back. We had waited 35 minutes with no service and we just decided to leave. When we went over to her to ask for our card back- she stumbled around her words and said sorry she forgot about us. Not going back to THIS Panini's location."}
{"text":"My visit in Panini's resulted in me and my friend feeling pretty sick after their food. Just for that, 1 star. Service was great, food wasn't great in taste or quality."}
{"text":"My first time ever at a Panini's and it was glorious.

My friend actually ordered for me - the jumbo turkey with bacon sandwich and it was HUGE! So big that I honestly wasn't sure if i could get it in my mouth in one bite. BUT i overcame and did it. It was awesome. The bread was so light and fluffy, the turkey was delicious and the 'kraut was great! I'm not a huge fan of sauerkraut in general but it totally makes this sandwich."}
{"text":"The Concord Panini's has a great location when you want to stop in for a late bite. Right near RT90 and RT44. 

We can drop in for a quick pizza or sandwich. They also sell pizza by the slice if you just got a bit of a munch."}
{"text":"Take out order was wrong.  Manager wouldn't make it right because we weren't charged the 99¢ up-charge.  Not our fault that we weren't charged for fries instead of the chips (that we hate & will be thrown out.)  We would have paid the $1.98.  Well, we won't be ordering takeout from here again anytime soon."}
{"text":"I guess I shouldn't have been surprised that there was no lunchtime crowd at this location because the service was terrible. The staff was completely inattentive and seemed inconvenienced whenever they stopped by the tables in our section. The wrap I had ordered barely resembled what I was expecting from the menu description. Maybe this place is better with a bar crowd, but I probably won't be finding out for myself."}
{"text":"Pretty much your average sports bar.  I always have a great time when I go, but its mostly the people I'm with and not necessarily the restaurant.  Service is pretty friendly though, drinks aren't too expensive, and drunk food is good.  They also have a patio for the summer time which is pretty nice"}
{"text":"We live right down the road and will drive an extra 10+ miles for better customer service. Every time we eat here the service is not up to par."}
{"text":"Ok, ok, ok. So it's not the bestttttt pizza in the city. It's not even in my top 10. BUT, it is convenient after a night of drinking, and the service is always helpful.

The last time we ordered a pizza from Panini's was last weekend actually. After a night out downtown, Panini's was on our walk home and we stopped in to order a pizza. Decently priced, and decent quality, especially after drinking. 

The restaurant workers behind the register/bar are always nice and helpful. We ordered the pizza and it was out to us within 10 minutes. They have hot sauce bottles nearby, so we always load up on spicy before we head home. 

Again, it's not the best, but it's convenient."}
{"text":"Decent food - had the burger and fries (greasy). My husband had the Pizza Points- he liked them! 
The food is average and the bar service was good. Honestly, we go to Panini's when we really don't care where we go. We will return the next time I don't feel like cooking."}
{"text":"Went on Saturday evening at 8:30pm, seated on patio, was moderately busy. One of the bartenders came to take our order after sitting there for over 20min. Took another 10 min to receive drinks, ordered spinach and artichoke dip which then came out quickly. We had no plates, napkins, and bartender never checked on us. The food was ok, if we had plates and were able to eat it when it was hot it may have been better. I had to go to the bar to order another drink and ask for plates and napkins. Even after that, the service never improved. Two more times we needed to go to bar to order our drinks, and waited for 30 min to get our check. By 10pm, the place was slow and there was no excuse for the painfully slow service. I do not know why this location seems to be cursed with completely inadequate staff that seem uninterested in waiting on customers. Total shame because the patio is lovely. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Typical bar food...the past couple of times the food has come out greasier than normal. Mixed drinks and martinis have always just been OK. Basically a nice spot to grab a late night bite and cheap drinks, or to watch a game."}
{"text":"Had a fantasy football draft party there sunday night 8/27/17. The Server we had ( cant remember her name) was very overwhelmed, told us numerous times she could not take our orders or get our drinks right that second because she was too busy. At one point she pretty much freaked out and yelled at us to stop asking her for drinks because she had to many tables. She should have asked for helped. There were plenty of servers standing around, and the place was pretty empty.
On top of that, the food wasnt the greatest. Our server also made many mistakes and blamed it on us saying we ordered wrong, which was not the case. Second year in a row we had our draft party there and it will probably be the last.
She did apologize as we left but overall it was a very disappointing experience for all 12 of us. Cant see many of returning at any point."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Panini's in years and now I know why.  We went in and asked up front about their desserts, the hostess went and checked in the back to see what they had, she came back and told us they had brownie sundaes; however, we got seated ordered a few drinks and tried to order the brownie sundae, and our server told us they were out of brownies.  So we ordered the sundae without the brownie.  

The beer on tap was flat, our nachos came without the guacamole we had asked for and even the ice cream came out wrong.  Our service was quite poor as well for a slow night.  Never have I really been all that impressed with Panini's and this recent visit just reinforced my opinion of the place."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came in to eat at around 9 pm. We stood at the host stand for about 4 and half minutes before someone came up to help us. There was only one table in the entire restaurant, a six top, when we arrived and they were cashing out. The only customers in the restaurant were people at the patio bar. 
We were sat at a high table where literally every single table around us either wasn't bussed (plates/cups/garbage still on it) or not wiped down with crumbs and garbage still on it. It was a little unappetizing to be surrounded by filth. The entire hour or so we were there the table where the six top was seated wasn't bussed at all after they left. 
My boyfriend and I never got a refill and our waitress was sitting at the bar eating nachos while watching TV in plain sight. Our food took a while to get to us as well. 
When our server dropped the check off she apologized for the slow service because there was no host that night so she had to \"host and serve.\" I'm a server and I get how that can be stressful if it's busy, but we were LITERALLY the only table in the restaurant and we were watching her eat at the bar to pass the time! 
She never came back to pick up the check so we just left cash on the table and left. We still left a tip because my boyfriend and I are both in the business, but this is the worst service I have ever received anywhere."}
{"text":"I love Panini's ! Its a classic Cleveland spot. I hate that they keep trying to class up this establishment. Its always been a sandwich/pizza joint thats open late night. I come here for the sandwiches which are hands down my favorite. I hate the new restaurant concept and wish it was still a beer and sandwich walk up joint! The food is just ok unless you order pizza or the overstuffed sandwich!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Waited 15 minutes in the waitress came to our table. Left. I will never go there again."}
{"text":"Food is decent. I order wings crispy and get them that way about half the time. Service could be better. They will stand around talking to each other for awhile before waiting on you. This has happened a few times."}
{"text":"I love going to this place when I'm in Kent. It has a diverse menu, anyone can find something they like. You can also, it's real easy to make changes. It's a sports bar with many TV screens. There's anawesome beer selection. Both on tap & bottles. If this place was in New York I'd be at this place all the time. The staff was attentive and the service was quick."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting it to be this type of atmosphere....an EXTREMELY loud bar, not the typical bar and grill scene. On the bright side though, the waitress was very sweet and I had a pretty tasty and fresh wrap. I'll have to try the other locations and hope they're not such an unpleasant atmosphere."}
{"text":"Good food, clean place...but unless you plan on waiting 1 to 2 hours after being seated to get food (with no warning), find another place. We are not sure whether its the lack of waitress enthusiasm or the cook not being able to keep up, but regaurdless, if they say you can be seated right away, think twice. This is our second attempt (two weeks apart) figuring once may be a fluke...nope."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for the cheesy bacon pub chips, but other than that it's nothing you can't get at another bar.

I like this location, but it always seems like the bartenders are pissed off to be there.

It is a nice bar - it has been several semi-swanky restaurants in the past, so they got a nice building to try and give Panini's an upscale feel.  I said \"try\".

Can I tell you I just don't get the sandwich though?  The bread and the fries are bland, the cole slaw is average at best.  I have told them over and over - at least grill the sandwiches on a flat top with some butter - at least then I would enjoy what i'm eating while I'm getting fat.  Put a runny egg on it too...  yummmmmmm..."}
{"text":"It's a sports bar.  Don't expect a whole lot, and you'll be happy.  They have beer, bar food, and TV's. 

I am a big fan of the pub chips - they go great with a few cold beers.  Nachos are good, but get them with the melted cheese and you'll be much happier.

I will tell you the one thing i really don't like about this place.  Every time I am there, there always seems to be some dickhead customer making life difficult for everyone in the bar.  You want my advice?  Go sit in the corner of the bar, get a few beers, watch some football, and you'll be fine - just don't be the dickhead customer."}
{"text":"As they were seeting us in a booth, I happened to notice onions on the seat right before I sat down. I tried to brush the onions off with a napkin and somehow got ketchup from the onions on my hand. Ewwww...I immediately left, out of disgust and went to BW3s with my girlfriend. This is the second time in a short period that I have noticed things that could be cleaned. The other time was ketchup All over the menu. I mean all over the menu. I think the managent there doesn't focus on cleaning like they should. John Taffer should inspect that place. It's a shame because we love  go there but it's a a huge turn off when they can't keep it simple clean ."}
{"text":"This local chain is a decent place to go if you like bar food, you can get a beer and a burger while watching the game but there are several drawbacks as well.
A) if you go later you can expect a rowdy crowd on game days, and if you just want a decent meal and it happens to be at the same time, it's very hard to carry on a conversation over the excitement and fandom.
B) at times the staff seems to give preferential treatment to game watchers over casual diners and it's hard to flag down a server over the the noise. 

On the plus side, there are some things that stand out as far as service goes
1) when they are not busy, the staff seem to get a new attitude and become very helpful in the menu items
2) it is one of the few places in the area that has a kitchen that is open late and you can still sit and order from a full menu

It is the more likely than not rowdy atmosphere that keeps this location from getting a 4th star in my eyes

If you are a diehard Cleveland sports fan though, this is definitely a place for the game with friends and a cold beer or drink"}
{"text":"A casual sports bar with casual sports bar food.

I enjoyed the food at Panini's.  We split a platter of fried appetizers and then I went for the buffalo chicken wrap.  All of the food was good and I could see myself enjoying a football game here.  My only problem was the service.  It was a bit slow and we found ourselves here for quite a while.  Over all, an ok experience!"}
{"text":"Food was good. One problem...THEY DON'T MAKE PANINI'S!!!!! No idea how a restaurant would name themselves after a food they don't even serve, but they apparently just like the word (?).
Service was great though, so we added the third star.
So, if youre not in the mood for a panini, go to Panini's."}
{"text":"Our party of 15 or so chose to sit in the back bar area. We're low maintenance, don't mind sitting at separate tables, don't need our food out at the same time, we just like to hang out for an evening with our friends and mingle. One of the employees tried to give my food to someone else (same dish, different mods, read your tickets as a credit card was requested from everyone, even those just ordering food you could at least write a name on the tickets). Even those of us just ordering food (sitting at tables) were required to either leave a credit card or cash out immediately. The credit cards were left in what appeared to be a cup in an area that anyone (including customers) had access to. When an appetizer came out an employee walked out of the kitchen and simply yelled the name of the dish waiting for someone to claim it. One of the bartenders kept giving my friend the paper but not the coin change for his drinks. If you're gonna tip yourself you've screwed yourself. I wasn't given napkins with my meal, glad the pile of cocktail napkins was nearby, and at no point did a server check on me and ask how my meal was. Rather than using an ice scoop, employees used a plastic cup which was left in the ice all night (you're touching that cup which is touching the ice with the same hands you use to handle cash?) When the server/bartender felt that the party was winding down she sat down at the bar and played with her phone. If she was done we would have been more than happy to move to the front bar area as it was later in the night and there was room for what was left of our group in the front room. Instead wr had to interrupt her texting if we wanted a drink. Mediocre food and mediocre service. Disappointed. For a place that boasts a corporate standard it sure must be a low one."}
{"text":"I can't believe the bad rap this place is getting.  Guys, what other sports bar do you have besides Fox and Hound....especially with a nice patio??  I know the food might only be 3 stars at best but its still got a little bit of everything for the happy hour crowd and late night partyers.  

I encourage you to adopt the 3 strike policy when it comes to restaurants, you might just be catching someone on their bad night.  I also will stress the fact that getting anything premade like spinach dip is ALWAYS a risk.  It might be difficult at Panini's but try to find something made with fresh ingredients, and if they still f' it up after that then ....strike 2."}
{"text":"I had some not so good service several years ago. This time, I brought may staff for a get together appreciation party. We mainly ordered appetizers like wings, mozzarella cheese sticks, artichoke dips, potato skins and few more. The garlic Parmesan cheese wings was good. The BBQ and hot is not bad either. The waitress that served us did an outstanding job. 

Compared to the last time I was here, it was a world different. At least for the service. It's a bar food and it's not too bad."}
{"text":"Manager marrying booze?!?!?! Shows you what a dive this place is, and how poorly owned it is... Well, go for lots of tvs, bad beer, food that is worse, and make sure to pick up the Pepto on the way home.  If you're not looking for much, you'll still be disappointed here.  It's a franchise, a poor one at that.."}
{"text":"Service was the slowest I've ever experienced- waited an hour for 2 sandwiches and 12 wings - 25 minutes for our beers. It wasn't busy at all... 3pm on a beautiful Saturday - sigh - had hoped this would be better because the patio is great but the service is terrible for mediocre food at best. We won't be back anytime soon..."}
{"text":"It's ok. Great patio. Panini's is minutes away from work. I have gone there twice with co-workers for lunch. I would never suggest it but if people want to go I wouldn't drag feet. I have gotten a black bean burger and roasted red pepper wrap."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout. 2nd experience with this place. First time, food was terrible. Second time, takeout was inedible. Pile of soggy, greasy fries. Mac and cheese wad like soup. We're done with this place."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service. They don't even welcome you when you come in, and take forever to get food, drinks, even water. Horrible."}
{"text":"Friends and I were there last night to see a band, we ordered the loaded cheese steak panini, it came out on plain white bread I asked them to grill it and they barely grilled 1 side, there was a ton of coleslaw on it but not to much of anything else. I told the waitress to let the chef know that was a piss pore example of a sandwich. On a good note the band was good just don't eat there."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time!!!  Horrible service. The place was not busy, but  we waited 15 minutes and finally a manager came over and took our drink order. She did take our order and relayed it to the kitchen. After another 20 minute wait our food came out with a hair in it! We had to take the food to them because no one came to check on us."}
{"text":"Sometimes I just get a taste for a panini and this place makes them. Good service. They have a new menu, which as my friend pointed out, means new prices. Spoiler: they didn't go down."}
{"text":"Myself and two others arrived at 12:25 PM on a Thursday. The fact that there was only one other table with customers should have been our sign.

The service was pretty good, the food was mediocre. I had the cheese steak and the steak was cooked to death, actually crispy and dry. Sad. 

Nobody was impressed, it was OK at best."}
{"text":"We placed an order for 12.  Picked it up, get back to find 3 orders missing.  We called back and they let us know it was sitting there and they would remake the order.  Picked up the replaced order and they wouldn't allow a refund, they said they could give us $20 but the 3 sandwiches totaled over $30.   The remade food was not even correct, once again.   They were not busy and not very nice.  I've been a  Panini's fan for 20 years now but will not be visiting this location again."}
{"text":"HUGE portions, especially a side order of fries. I ordered the signature sandwich with roast beef which was an unnecessary amount of food, complete with fries on the sandwich. I think I'd prefer my fries on the side.

A little bland, but a good spot for our purposes. They were willing to switch the TV above the bar to the Blackhawks game for me, which was a plus :)"}
{"text":"Stopped in to Panini's once again for lunch with an old friend.  On this trip, I ordered the fish sandwich with some cole slaw.  The bartender was friendly and very attentive.  Our drinks were refilled consistently and quickly.  

A few minutes later, the glorious fish sandwich was served.  Two large, steaming hot, breaded fish filets were served on a bun with lettuce, red onion, and a cup of tartar sauce.  The fish was delicious.  It was cooked right.  It was flaky, hot and huge.  It was a lot of fish for one sandwich, but I loved it and would definitely order it again.  The sandwich slaw was pretty tasty, but probably better on a Panini's sandwich than eaten alone. 

I want to order the fish sandwich again soon.  So good!"}
{"text":"Took over an hour for our appetizer to come to us. On a Friday night at 10 pm, mostly all the people in here are at the bar. Not the first time I've had a bad experience at this location. It's a shame because the food is good."}
{"text":"GREAT Patio!  I don't usually dine here for the indoor atmosphere, but once that sun comes out in the spring, this is probably the best patio in Strongsville.  Full bar and table service outside and nice ambiance."}
{"text":"Service is terrible.  My wife asked for a beer on their available board above the bar.  Bartender checked the refrigerator and then told us it wasn't available as she walked by us.  The odd part is it took 10 minutes to order a beer because the bartender didn't come back to us till then.  Had two beers and left to go to Bar Louis down the street."}
{"text":"My friends and I walked fucking 20 minutes to find out later that they were closed. We obviously called in advance and they said they were still open. Never going back!!!!"}
{"text":"Ate there for lunch yesterday.  This a nice sports bar style place.  Waitress was very helpful and friendly.  I had the overstuffed sandwich, Italian style.  It was very good.  I ate it with a fork as it was too big to eat normally.  The serving size was about right.... IE: If you took the fries out of the sandwich, it would be a \"normal\" size sandwich with fries."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Panini's since the early 90's grabbing a sandwich late night in the Flats. I was thrilled to have a location in Twinsburg. Overall, the service was usually good and the food great. Today, I came in mid afternoon and it was pretty quiet. The sign said \"Please seat yourself\" so I grabbed a booth. The booths I walked past looked dirty. The one I sat at was the cleanest but still needed cleaning. I saw two servers and a guy I assume was a cook sitting at a table talking. After a couple minutes, one of the servers came over and brought a menu and took my drink order. She came right back with my drink and I gave her my food order. I ordered a bacon egg and cheese panini sandwich and she left. I got my food in a timely fashion but my sandwich had ham on it which I didn't ask for and the fries were not cold, but they were obviously not fresh and a little skimpy compared to usual. I ate half of the sandwich without complaining because I like ham. Just not what I wanted. I never did get any silverware or even a napkin. The servers returned to their conversation and I was never checked on again. She never did wipe the table and the lack of concern for cleanliness left me wondering how clean the kitchen was. After I finished eating half of the sandwich I waited at least ten minutes for a server to finally check on me. I said no, just the check please. The server was friendly but seemed very unmotivated and the food quality wasn't quite what I've come to expect. It seemed like they were unsupervised. I blame the manager or maybe there wasn't one. I was disappointed because the service is always pretty good."}
{"text":"The food here is a little above average fair for a chain restaurant. While  the  Kickin' Buffalo wings were not hot enough, they were still pretty tasty. Pizzas are fresh and good but nothing to write home about.  
The service was very good and the outdoor patio is excellent. They even had corn hole set up.  
Inside the bar is large. Only a few beers on tap."}
{"text":"I'm starting to lose track of how many times I've been disappointed when going to a Paninis. Went here on a Sunday to watch football games with some friends. First they tell us that beer specials don't start until game time, even though we got there at 12:30. Then, we come to find out that they don't have NFL Sunday Ticket and can only show the Browns game...unforgivable. if I wanted to torture myself and watch a Browns game, then I'd spend the $5 it cost to buy a ticket and got see them at the stadium. We left and went to Hooky House of the street. What kind of sports bar only shows one football game at 1pm???"}
{"text":"Pathetic blue cheese fries but the waitress was great about it. She was really apologetic and brought us some blue cheese crumbles as well as dressing and that fixed it right up. The build your sandwich was delicious. It's been a while since I've had a really good burger. The pretzel bun was just icing on the cake. 
The atmosphere is pretty cool. Not so loud that you can't enjoy some converstaion over your meal but not so silent that the place feels dead. Overall, I liked it and would definitely go back to try more of their menu."}
{"text":"3 1/2 stars. Food was very good, it just wasn't what I was expecting. I wanted a panini, like the flat kind that's grilled type thing. I ordered a turkey melt panini with no bacon. I got a turkey melt on regular Italian type bread, thick like toast, and it was \"grilled\" like a grilled cheese sandwich would be. It was very greasy. The fries were somewhat over done. Good service. Typical bar food but I was hoping for more."}
{"text":"Hubby and I brought the kids here on a bright and sunny Saturday afternoon to find the place empty!  I was surprised, but seeing as KSU was out, it wasn't totally unexpected.  We had a wonderful time!  The boys loved all the TVs and the food was brought out fast and fresh.  Very hot all around.  I only gave 4 stars because parking is a bit of a bitch.  Yeah, I'd come back!"}
{"text":"This place, while clean and neat, is also smaller than other places I have attended.  The hostess was quick to seat us and the servers were all friendly and knowledgeable.  The problem?  The food.  It was so lackluster, even my children were hard up to find something nice to say.  Everything was so overcooked and dry.  From my kids chicken tenders to my husband's burger and my sandwich.  DRY.  LIKE A DESERT.  Nothing could help our meals.  None of us finished anything but the sides.  

No.... I won't be coming back to this place to eat. Just for drinks."}
{"text":"Went to paninis for the first time in Kent and wasn't impressed, at all. I have been to their other locations and found them to be much more satisfactory. My date had a burger and the bun was completely soaked through with grease and the fries were subpar. My salad was good not great. The service was fast and the server was nice but the food was really disappointing. probably wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Typical bar and grill type place. The beer is cheap, the people are rowdy and it often gets pretty packed. There are always a lot of young people here which gets annoying!"}
{"text":"I've been here before it was a Panini's so coming back into it I was quite surprised to see what they had done to the place. Depending which Panini's one goes to depends what experience you will have. The one in Solon is super nice where this one falls near to the other end of the continuum. This is just a plain old bar and for begin a new remodel looks pretty old. It is very large however so even on a Saturday night there was no wait for service at the large inside bar which has many large TVs at a good viewing angle. There is an outside area here as well and smaller party rooms off the main bar which were both occupied the night I was there. The bartender was friendly, efficient and attentive."}
{"text":"A local joint in Cleveland Paninis is pretty rockin. They are famous for their sandwiches that are served with a healthy service of deli meat, topped with a delicious vinegar slaw and their in house French fries, all on the sandwich! The staff and service is on top of it and know what you need even before you do. The flavors are amazing and the size of the meal is sure to satisfy, but if your really hungry double meat is always an option here. Your gonna love it."}
{"text":"We had a great night - bar got busy after 10:00 or so, but the bar staff was very accommodating and made sure our drinks were filled and we had the right condiments for our food. The pizza, wings and panini were awesome!"}
{"text":"Sitting here on the new patio right now watching the Cavs game! Great food. Great Service! :)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite panini's location. There's a huge U shaped bar to sit at. But the best time to come is in the summer. The patio is spacious, and there's also a covered bar. They have a room for private events. I've rented it out on 2 occasions and they exceeded my expectations both times. It's a great place to hold showers or birthday parties."}
{"text":"Panini's is by far the best place to hit up at 2am after a rowdy night!!  Or at 2pm for no reason whatsoever.  Basically, this place is awesome and you would be a fool to not stop in!"}
