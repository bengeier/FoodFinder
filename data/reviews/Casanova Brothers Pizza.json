{"text":"\"You've Tried the Rest, NOW Try the BEST\"

By far, THEE best pizzeria in the Phoenix metro area.

These guys make you feel at home, and like family.  Great place for lunch or dinner.  The food is above all the rest, because they know how it's supposed to be done.  I mean, c'mon, they're from NYC.........
Worth the visit. I drive 20+ miles just to eat here.  Never a let down"}
{"text":"The Casanova brothers have the best NY pizza in Gilbert. Be sure and try the garlic knots if you like bread sticks. The wings are big, crispy, and juicy. The pizza is top notch NY thin crust pizza.

{"text":"Went there last night for the first time.  The pizza was great but the service was even better.  The manager Tony took care of us and he was awesome.  Im from chicago so im not a huge new york pizza guy.  I was totally impressed with the quality of the pie and the slices were huge.  My daughter loved the garlic knots.  We will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite Italian food in the valley. These guys rock. Talk about service, more restaurants should take notes."}
{"text":"It looks, feels, sounds, smells, and most importantly tastes like the pizzerias I was raised at in Queens. Tony sounds like the New Yorkers I grew up with, just nicer. He is always happy to see you and treats everybody like gold. Very good pizza but this place is all about the sandwiches and pasta. I love the Chicken parm hero. Yummy baked ziti, and very good meatball parm hero. The only negative. These boys are from the Bronx and are yankee fans. LETS GO METS!!!"}
{"text":"By far the best pizza in the state. Their pizza and garlic knots are amazing. The owners make you feel like family here."}
{"text":"Great white pizza! Fast service and its close to home. Great neighborhood pizza place, love supporting local businesses."}
{"text":"The service is outstanding..... and the food even better. It was my first time there and Tony made me feel like a regular. Eggplant parm is very good as well as the Shrimp fettuccine. I will definitely be back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"I was part of a group of 15 out-of-towners who were staying in Gilbert for a golf trip.  Not familiar with the pizza options in the area and we found Casanova Brothers on Yelp and ordered eight pizzas & garlic knots... 

Boy were the large pizzas big (& tasty)!  Everyone in the group was extremely happy with the decision.  We'll be back next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"We visited this place yesterday with some out of town family. I gotta say that their customer service was top notch. Tony greeted all of us and asked for our names. Made you feel very comfortable and almost like family. Since it was our first time here they gave us some garlic knots to try.  We tried 3 different types of pizza and they were all delicious. Can't wait to go back and try their subs.
Highly recommended this place!!!"}
{"text":"Being from Long Island ny, this is the only pizzeria I've found that makes me feel like I'm in a pizzeria from back in New York, from the old school look of the place and home style food to match, this is my new go to spot, just how I like it for italian and deli sandwiches"}
{"text":"You are immediately greeted when you walk in, like you're family. Very polite staff, clean environment and great food! The pizza is like what I grew up with in New York and New Jersey."}
{"text":"From the warm greeting by Tony, to the atmosphere, the food, and the service...all were awesome! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Having lived out on the East Coast for 7 years and frequenting the city almost every weekend, I was in the mood for a NYC 'street corner' slice.  Searched around Yelp and this place obviously caught my eye, by both the ratings and the vicinity to my house.

Just like a couple of other reviewers on here, I walked in and was immediately greeted by Tony.  He introduced himself and asked me if it was my first time there. After placing my to go order (plain cheese pie...my standard when sizing a pizza place up), he hooked me up with a free order of garlic knots while waiting for my pizza.  They were awesome...super garlicky and soft.  I skipped the provided tomato sauce because they were so good on their own.  Waited a couple of more minutes and Tony hooked me up with a bad of Zeppole!  Didn't eat them there, but had them at home after the pizza and they were a perfect end to my meal.

To the pizza...15 minutes later and I was heading out with my pie.  The aroma alone was intoxicating on the drive home.  TOTALLY reminding me of my time spent in the city.  Got home, opened up the box and wasted no time on my first slice...it was all that I missed about NYC pizza.  Thin, chewy crust that actually has great flavor on its own, good quality and perfectly greasy cheese and a light but well seasoned and tangy sauce.  The ONLY thing that I would've changed is that I tend to like my crust a little more well done...I don't mind a little burnt crust on the bottom and edges.  I noticed that outside of NYC, pizza places that are ''NY style'' tend to show a little restraint in this respect, probably because people not used to it might complain that their pizza is burnt. (I don't really know if I'm right, but I'm guessing because I noticed this at Grimaldis).  Easy fix...just order it ''well done'' next time.  Based on my experience with the guys working there, they'd be more than happy to accommodate.

Anyway, all in all a great pie and GREAT people/service...it definitely satisfied my craving.  As a self proclaimed pizza fanatic (I'm on Serious Eats pizza blog, Slice, daily), all those fancy wood-fired pizza places (a la Bianco and kin) are great, but when I want that NYC pizza that I often crave, these guys will be getting my business every time.

They also have a pretty decent pasta and hoagie selection...might have to hit those up next time.  Thanks again guys.

(sorry this was a bit long)"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Great prices. But what stood out to me most was the customer service. Tony, one of the owners, met us at the door and welcomed us in. When he learned that this was our first time in, he asked for our names and made a point to call us by name throughout our meal. I noticed him acknowledging several other customers by name and exchanging pleasantries with them as well.

When our food came we were delighted by the large portions for the lunch menu. I had pizza and my wife had the baked ziti. Both were phenomenal!

Overall it was a fantastic dining experience and we expect to become regulars at Casanova Brothers. Thanks, Tony!!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I have had in the east valley.  Very friendly staff, all came out to meet first time patrons.   Make everyone feel welcome.  5 big stars!"}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service. What more can you say about a place. Everything I have had here has been amazing and I will continue to return and try all the other amazing items on their menu."}
{"text":"Talk about feeling welcome. The cashier introduced herself, shook our hands and offered us free garlic knots. We haven't even received our food yet and I'm a customer for life."}
{"text":"Hands down, THE best pizza place around.  I've been a New Yorker for 40+ years and been here for the past few and Casanova Brothers is a very authentic neighborhood pizza place.  I could eat pizza a few times a week, every week and this place is tops.  The owners make everyone feel like a regular.  Also, the calzones are the fantastic and this is one of the few places that offers fried calzone.  Spectacular.  I'm sure all the other dishes are fantastic as well but the pizza is sooooo good, that is what our family usually only orders.  Food, atmosphere, top notch friendly service.  I cannot say enough good things about this place.

Also get the cannolis for dessert, superb"}
{"text":"Pizza is the best I have had in the valley. People there are awesome. Louie addresses  each and every person by name. We will be going back and conquer the entire menu."}
{"text":"Best pizza by the slice in the Gilbert/Mesa area.  Guys that own it try to make it like a true NY pizza SLICE place. (People not from NY just don't get it).  

The guys are friendly and know a lot of customers by name. 

Try the white slice or just the classic pepperoni or just the regular slice.  You won't be dissappointed."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever, the marinara a little watery but that's so splitting hairs on how good the pizza is, and the customer service was exceptional"}
{"text":"These guys r the real deal!! Excellent food, great service! Try the white sauce pizza"}
{"text":"Chicken Parmesan is delicious. The owner came by and was very friendly. Noodles in the fettuccine Alfredo tasted homemade. Next time we will try the pizza too! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I finally tried cassanova bros today. Had to see what all fuss was about. Now im not from New York but ive visited many times and eaten there and nor am i a ridiculous pizza snob so with that being said..I got two cheese slices for about $6 .  The service was good and prompt so no complaints there.  The pizza i got litteraly tasted like frozen pizza. There is no way in hell anybody can convince me that this is even remotely close to new york pizza. There was absolutely NOTHING special about it. It was very disappointing. I had heard that the cheese was incredible but it wasnt. This is  like the 5th place on yelp ive tried because of GREAT yelp reviews and ive come to the conclusion that people get hyped up for anything. Honestly no joke Venezias is way better and tastier. I even prefer a costco pizza over this place.  AWFUL and never again will i eat there. Waste of time and money!! Order dominos and do yourself a favor!"}
{"text":"Brought my family in for dinner tonight. Terrific authentic NY style pizza.  I think it's the best pizza in the valley! We also ordered wings and a Philly cheesesteak.  You can't go wrong with either. Everything was excellent ! 

The owners were so friendly that I thought I was at my cousin Tony's house for dinner ;-)"}
{"text":"5 stars for customer service. I have never felt more welcome in a restaurant. Every employee makes an effort to create an excellent guest experience. Now on to the food. 
First off, first time customers are treated with free garlic knots. We got the white pizza and the Neapolitan regular. IT'S A MUST!!!! I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who is craving Italian."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Many should visit and find out what hospitality really is!! Tony personally introduced himself and was super friendly. They call you by name and treat you like family. They are very friendly and the pizza was delish. Not to pricy! Defiantly worth the stop!! Go now!"}
{"text":"I have recommend Casanova Bros to my friends for many years, but last night I was sadly disappointed and won't recommend them anymore. One of my favorite things about this restaurant was their authentic New York style pizza but last night my large deluxe pizza was a pre made crust that tasted like cardboard. I've had frozen pizza that tasted better. They do have great customer service but for as expensive as their pizza is, I want a fresh hand tossed crust."}
{"text":"Second time eating here, got the spaghetti with meatballs the meatballs were good but could have a couple more for $11. I've definitely had better spaghetti n meatballs I wouldn't say it was bad just expected more for $11 and from a place that has great pizza. Would say for same price nypd has better pasta."}
{"text":"I initially called in after reviewing other Yelp reviews and checking out the menu to see what the owner recommend.  Tony was very friendly and helpful, informing me that the meatballs and eggplant are homemade. He also offered free garlic knots as a first-time customer, which I was thrilled about because those also got great reviews.  When I came to pick up my food, you can immediately feel the ambience and the friendliness of the whole staff.  Tony shook my hand and introduced himself...such wonderful customer service!  I will definitely be back to try the eggplant sub!"}
{"text":"I just moved to AZ from NY and it's amazing to have some old school NY pizza and cuisine only a mile from where I live! Thank you guys! Love big time from the Boogie Down!!!"}
{"text":"Wow!  I thought Frost had the best customer service and product in town, Cassanova takes the cake!  First time there, I was immediately greeted with a hand shake and a call out to the team about my first time visitor!  Food was fantastic? Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Casanova Brothers is the best! The owners are there everyday and make a point of introducing themselves and learning your name. Pretty cool when there is a family/friend owned business that works well and they want to make you a part of their family. The pizza is amazing of course, but they have really good sandwiches and salads as well."}
{"text":"The wings and pizza were good.  The meatball parmesan had no flavor. The bread was not toasted enough. I'm from NYC this is not that up New York City standards."}
{"text":"Service is fast and friendly, especially like how they treated my grandson :) kept him busy with pizza dough to play with while we ate! Best Pizza in Gilbert!!"}
{"text":"Walked in and was immediately greeted by one of the owners , and offered knots and marinara sauce, delicious! ! He talked with the whole family gave us menus and made it a comfortable place for us to dine. The food was GREAT , big family so we all tried different plates. Pizza was right on, best pizza I've had in a long time, lasagna was perfect, ravioli as well...Chicken Alfredo was very tasty ..And as for  dessert. ..the cannoli was DEADLY, perfect way to end the night out for some Italian cuisine! ...."}
{"text":"I visited Casanova Brothers Pizza for the first time today, from frantically Googling \"Pizza by the Slice\" in Gilbert, Az.
I raced down there because I only have a thirty minute lunch break, and was greeted by one of the friendliest people I've ever met (I'm pretty sure he was the owner).
He said he would have my order done very quickly, and he very much held up to that expectation! I was able to get my food, get back to work, and enjoy it all within my lunch break.
The pizza was AMAZING. The cheesecake melted in my mouth! The garlic knots were perfect!
Not only will I be back (frequently, at that) for the food, but the amazing and personal customer service that I experienced. 
I can't wait to recommend this place to all my coworkers at GoDaddy!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped in while staying in Gilbert on business. Very friendly staff, made us feel welcome. Pizza was excellent!"}
{"text":"You feel the love when you walk in. You taste the love when you eat. If youre not smiling when you leave, you didn't eat enough!! I love this place!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! I read the reviews with amusement, so much talk of the customer service and amazing pizza. I was on that side of town and saw they serve slices all day, so decided to give it a try. Tony is the real deal! He knew the name of each customer that came in, immediately made me feel welcome and offered me garlic knots on the house!  They were delish, not overpowering, but doughy and just right.  The sauce was on point.

I decided to try the zeppolis (fried dough in powdered sugar).  Wish I had ordered more than 3!

I got a regular pepperoni slice and a slice of white. Confirmed I am a regular pepperoni slice kind of girl!

Friendly employees, unreal and amazing customer service!"}
{"text":"The Food: 
I ordered the cheese garlic knots for an appetizer. They were delicious and they were very generous with the cheese. They were small but you get six of them.

For the main course, I shared a slice of white pizza, a slice of sicilian white pizza with spinach and sausage, and a large pizza calzone. The white pizza was simple and delicious. The sicilian slice was perfectly crispy/crunchy, probably my favorite part of the meal. The calzone was extremely generous with cheese, I'm big on cheese so I loved it.  (10/10)

The Dessert:
I had the pleasure of trying the zeppolis. They were fresh baked and tasted doughy (in a good way), with a light sweetness to them. I recommend them if you don't want to eat something too sweet, great quality. (9/10)

The Service:
The owners were very friendly and welcoming. They ask for your name and remember it throughout your visit. Since it was our first time visiting, the garlic knots were free. The food we wanted was made from scratch, so naturally we had to wait it. There was a small mishap in the kitchen and they had to remake our food. They let us know the situation in a friendly manner. After trying the appetizer and the white pizza we decided it was worth the wait so we were patient. They gave us some zeppolis as compensation. Accidents happen, and they did a great job of making up for it! (10/10)

The Atmosphere:
Loved the music, they had oldies playing. The place was dimly lit and had an intimate feel. It was quiet and calm. You order at the front counter, but other than that it is a good sit-down place. (7/10)"}
{"text":"Tough review for me to post. I really like these guys. First time I went it was dead and just the two owners. Great experience and great pizza.

Second time. No owners, soggy pizza, sauce tasted like it was straight out of a can. Also serving cold Zeppoles is unacceptable!!

Consistency might be an issue with this place."}
{"text":"After searching on yelp for a nearby pizza spot, I decided to give this place a try. When I walked in I was immediately greeted & asked if I have ever been there before. I responded no & they guy reached his arm out to shake my hand to welcome me. I thought that was pretty cool. He explained the menu to me & took my order. He gave me a free appetizer for it being my first visit.

While sitting down waiting for my order to go, another man came over & introduced himself & thanked me for coming in. I can really appreciate the customer service this place offers. 

I ordered 2 slices & both were tasty. I will be back."}
{"text":"They are amazing when it come to pizza you can't go wrong. They also have great lunch specials for around $5.99 to $8.99 and they are worth every penny."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever ever ever the white pizza is the best I love it and how they worried about small detail like saying your name when you get in"}
{"text":"Pizza here is really good. They also have garlic knots that are great. We also get the Zepoli with powdered sugar. The owners are nice and the food is always good"}
{"text":"The food is amazing, and the service is even better!  Tony makes you feel like family. We will be back many times!"}
{"text":"I have to agree with Stephanie T here. I visited Casanova Brothers a couple weeks ago in hopes of finding an authentic NY pizza. I was born and raised in NJ so I know a good pizza, plus I was in NY a couple weeks ago as well so I craved a good slice.

I ordered a pie to go and Tony noticed I was a new customer and introduced himself to me and shook my hand. He was the nicest guy! I had huge hopes for this place because the staff was so friendly. 

Don't get me wrong, the pizza didn't taste bad. It just wasn't the taste I wanted. I don't find this pizza close to NY pizza. The garlic knots I could go without. I got them for free so I can't really complain. They were indeed chewy and bland and the sauce didn't do much for them. And it's weird that you need to microwave them.

I wouldn't go out of my way to suggest this place, but I say give it a shot and judge for yourself."}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday for lunch. They opened at 12pm and there were already people waiting and as we were there waiting and eating, they had lots of traffic. That was a sign to us that people liked this restaurant. We ordered an XL pizza and got a large pizza for 50% off. They brought us complimentary garlic knots, which was nice and they tasted good. The pizza took a long time to get to our table but it was worth the wait. The crust was crispy and sauce and cheese were flavorful. Our bill was incorrect when we paid but the cashier fixed it before we left. There were some issues to work out to streamline the process but the food was terrific."}
{"text":"Have tried multiple pizzas and multiple dishes here.  Food is ALWAYS awesome.  Staff is friendly and super attentive.  If you're anywhere near here this is a must-go-to for Italian food and/or pizza."}
{"text":"Hmm, I thought the pizza was okay but not as fabulous as I've heard and a little on the pricey side. Perhaps we ordered the wrong kind or something. It was absolutely crazy busy for a Wednesday night which made for a very long stomach gurgling wait but alas garlic knots to the rescue! :) The garlic knots were out of this world ooey gooey buttery deliciousness. 

The servers were all very friendly and make a point to ask your name and if you've tried Casanova Brothers Pizza before...nice personal touch.

One suggestion though - I think with the amount of business they do they should have menu service at the tables. The order area was so jammed packed full of people waiting it spilled into the table area. 

Anchovy pizza for me next time!!"}
{"text":"Casanova brothers pizza was AMAZING. We walked in as first timers and Tony introduced himself right away and showed us the ropes to the restaurant. I was given the best customer service I've ever been given and I was only there for about 2 minutes. They have great lunch specials and great pizza. And you HAVE TO get the garlic knots and zippolis. Although I don't live close I plan on coming back here as much as possible!"}
{"text":"The garlic knots were microwaved to reheat them which made them very tough to chew. The girl behind the counter actually said she was putting them in the microwave and they would be right up. My pizza slices were missing a topping and instead of them making new slices, they just threw the missing topping right on top and served it. The marinara sauce on my pizza had no flavor. I now have the worst indigestion ever!! Will never go back and never recommend."}
{"text":"Casanova's pizza. USED to be good. Tony was there all the time and he knew us by name. The dough was crispy and home made. The cheese tasted fresh and the sauce was great, the pizza was always fresh out of the oven. But then they just got lazy. The dough felt like it was fresh...right out of the freezer. The sauce tasted like a can of PREGO and the pizza wasn't fresh anymore it felt it had sat out and Tony wasn't there as much as he used to. I still like the pizza when Tony is there, but when he isn't there the pizza is not as good. I would recommend this to a friend if they were wanting pizza and wanted something a \"little\" better than a \"fast food\" pizza place such as Little Caesars."}
{"text":"Very good pizza. Only ordered a large pepperoni but it was very satisfying. I was greeted by the owner and given garlic knots for being there for the first time. I highly recommend. Definitely helps me get past Prima Pizza getting taken over by new ownership."}
{"text":"....maybe the best deep dish pizza I've ever had."}
{"text":"Great pizza, friendly people!  Glad to have found my new favorite local pizza place. 

Got the margherita pizza, which was delicious, along with some fried zucchini.   Good desserts, too.  Staff was very welcoming."}
{"text":"I love their pizza and garlic knots, especially their white pizza! They are always so nice and remember your name and order every time i call or go in. I have never been to a restaurant where they know who you are walking in the door. Their extra large pizza is so nice for when I have work meetings to make it easy to feed everyone."}
{"text":"All I can say is yum! The white pizza is amazing. They are so friendly, and take the time to acknowledge every customer who comes in the door. Truly a great spot!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite italian place to go for lunch!  Tony is always so welcoming and the customer service is amazing!  The food arrives quickly and is always delicious, and the ambiance is very cozy, clean, and comfortable.  Our kids love it too, because they feel like they are part of a fun italian family in the middle of New York!  This restaurant is a winner!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza I have ever had. The guy who works there tries to learn your name and the service is awesome.  Tony- you run the best joint in town!"}
{"text":"The best pizza in this side of the Mississippi. The friendliest staff ever. This is what home tastes like."}
{"text":"If I didn't know any better, I would have thought I just went to my local pizza place for the 100th time. I walked in the door and I was asked very quickly by a sweet girl if I had been there before and I said no. Suddenly the owner comes rushing out to introduce himself and shake my hand. The entire kitchen yells, \"Hi Kim!\" It was so overwhelming.. IN THE BEST WAY! 

Garlic knots were rushed to my table quite quickly and FREE as an appitizer. My kids were in heaven. I was super impressed. We went with the usual, a giant pepperoni pizza. It was delicious! The crust you actually want to eat and not leave behind. The owner bounced around from table to table talking to customers and asking how their meal was or talking about the neat pictures on the walls. 

As we were finishing up I saw the owner Tony walking up to my table with a basket and he surprised me with these fresh steaming hot fried/baked dough balls with powdered sugar. On the house he says. REALLY?! Where did this guy come from? Why isn't this place packed?! This was the best customer service and restaurant experience I have ever had at ANY place in the valley. This is how you run a small business! You can tell the owner is so passionate about his business. You can't be that hands on and not be. People were coming in the door and he knew them by name. His employees were greeting and hugging guests like they were family that came every Saturday. It was the best experience! 

You would be absolutely silly to not make this a stop if you're in Gilbert Arizona. Don't let the strip mall atmosphere/look fool you or prevent you from pulling in. You can and will thank me later. 

Thanks Tony for showing this absolute stranger and her twin boys an amazing evening at your establishment. I had to race back to our hotel and take the time to write this review before carrying on with our evening."}
{"text":"My parents raved about this place, so we had to try it out! Excellent and very warm service from start to finish! My 2 year old is a very picky eating and she couldn't get enough of the pizza! She loved it. It was delicious and exactly what I was hoping for! Definitely going back very soon:)"}
{"text":"After missing New York flavor for quite some time...we found this place in Gilbert, AZ. The pizza reminds me of being back in NYC!  Everything was amazing...Between the ambiance and food this is a place that will transport you back to the East Coast. Not only was the pizza mouthwatering and topped with the best sauce and sausage and fresh cut basil but we also had wings and fettuccini Alfredo. The wings had a toasty crunch on the outside and juicy inside. The fettuccini Alfredo had a nice creamy texture and the taste was something else. Everything here from the ambience to the tasty food, I am going to be dreaming about this place until I come back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for quick pizza slice, and so glad I did.  Quick, delicious, super friendly.  I wish we lived in the area.  I definitely will stop in again next time I'll in the area.  I had the sausage pizza slice.  Hot, fresh, thin crust and delicious."}
{"text":"There was a point when I'd probably rate this place 4 or 5 stars, but now I'm pretty set at 3.5, and here's why:

Casanova is just inconsistent, with their pizza quality and their customer service. It all really depends on who is working that day. First the pizza. It's always \"good\" at the very least, but it's also been amazing. The last two pizzas I've ordered had pretty disappointing cheese, almost like they changed the kind they've been using for years. It was also much greasier than pizzas I've ordered in the past. But even those pizzas were better than most you will find in the east valley, so don't let that deter you from hitting this place up for pizza day.

It also seems like the customer service drops considerably when it's busy. Read the reviews here, Casanova is widely regarded as having the best customer service around. So when you call in an order for pickup and they're short with you on the phone, and almost act like you're inconveniencing them when you go in to pick it up, it's definitely noticeable. This has only happened twice, so they're still batting above average in the CS department. 

Overall, this is a great choice for pizza in the Phoenix metro area. They just set such a high precedent over the years, and due to the increased popularity (thanks to Yelp), I just hope they can maintain their quality."}
{"text":"Pizza is very tasty. Crust is nice and thin and they are not stingy with toppings. I would suggest take out on the weekends though to avoid a long wait."}
{"text":"First time there and disappointed! Got a sicilian large pizza, paid 26.00 for 2 ingredients!  And the pizza tasted like little caesars!! Not for that price! 26.00 dollar pizza tasted like 5.00 pizza!!"}
{"text":"By far the best pizza in the valley. Mike, Tony and all their crew make you feel like part of the family. This is real NY pizza with a neighborhood appeal."}
{"text":"Decent local pizza place. I wanted to give it 5 stars but not quite there. Garlic knots were OK. I don't really like the idea that they make 25,000 of them at one time. It would be nice if they were made fresh to order.Pizza is decent. Kind of expensive for me. It's busy every time I go in so that's a good thing."}
{"text":"This is the best NY style pizza I've had in the valley and I'm picky coming from northern NJ.  Standard cheese slices are good but this place really shines with it's sicilian  and white pizza. The sicilian crust is cooked perfectly!  Of course they sell by the slice.  The staff are friendly and go out of their way to remember your name. I only wish it were closer but then again I'd just be fatter."}
{"text":"In a world where proper serving and customer service is in decay, Casanova Brothers steps up to the plate. The staff are quick to remember your name and anything else about you for your return visit. Their ability to make you part of their family while providing great tasting food really sets their restaurant apart."}
{"text":"Always been a pleasure eating in or out. The staff is very inviting and I love their personalities. The food is out of this world amazing. They use the best ingredients and I am never disappointed."}
{"text":"Service sucks, ordered a pizza to go and it wasn't ready got there 30 minutes after I ordered it and so it took about 40 minutes to cook a pizza, I called before they were open so it was 50 minutes total. I'm pretty sure I was the first order so I think that's a bit ridiculous"}
{"text":"Bottom line...this is the only pizza I will eat outside of my own kitchen!

Excellent crust, great cheese, not too saucy and the SERVICE?!?!?!?!  Fuggeddaboutit!  Love the guys and love the attention they give to their customers.  Best pizza in town!"}
{"text":"My family and i love Casanova's quite a bit, so much so that my 5 year niece wants a large pizza from Casanova's for Christmas. I can't say enough good things about this restaurant. Good food, amazing staff and we go any chance we can to enjoy some great and food and great company."}
{"text":"super friendly staff. Tony is all about relationships. that alone makes me come back. but the food is out of this world. if you want good authentic Italian food, this is the only place to go."}
{"text":"Was met at the door by Tony with a smile, handshake and introduction. I love that! The atmosphere is quiet, happy and a family like environment. The garlic knots are amazing as is the pizza. I will be coming back here on a regular basis. It's nice to be remembered by name when you walk into an establishment. Makes you feel like your business really matters."}
{"text":"Best pizza in gilbert hands down! Wonderful service and atmosphere. you just cant beat it."}
{"text":"This place was the best pizza place I have ever been to. Great sicilian pizza, fresh toppings etc. And their fettuccine Alfredo was amazing as well! Definitely recommend this place. Garlic knots and dessert was fantastic too."}
{"text":"Coming from a fellow NYer we loved this place!! Excellent food and service!  Too bad we don't live closer, I'd be here all the time. Service was fast and the food was authentic.   Very friendly, very tasty!  Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Tony and the rest of the staff are amazing. Although it was incredibly busy tony gave great personal attention and still seemed thankful for each patron. Even if the food was terrible I would gladly order from them for the service alone. Luckily there's no need to make that choice.

The pizza tastes very authentic and delicious. It has a unique taste in that it really tastes homemade more than many other pizza places. The wings were flavorful and very crispy. The garlic knots were delicious as well and they gave us extra for it being our first time. They are also very affordable. The food takes a while (it took an hour) but that's to be expected for good food. I highly recommend Casanova Bros. And urge you to give them all of your money."}
{"text":"I come here a lot. The guys treat me like family and know me by name which is pretty cool. Definitely rare these days. They are the real deal. Like Mario and Luigi :) 

They serve a ton of great food on their menu. Their pride is to please you with their food. 

Missing a star only because I wish their prices were a little lower so I could sample more of their menu."}
{"text":"My husband and I set out to have a nice date night. After walking in, we agreed that the place wasn't quite what we expected from appearance- more casual than expected, but it smelled amazing. Ordering in itself was a great experience. The staff are very friendly. They went out of their way to take little extra steps to make out visit special. I felt like I was home. The food was delicious! (I had the baked ziti, my husband had the sausage pamasanea) The service was prompt, friendly and very personal. All the guests were thoroughly enjoying themselves. Half way through, my husband stated that he wished he knew about this place while we were dating, because he would have taken me there to seal the deal!"}
{"text":"Great Pizza makes me feel like i am back home in NY. This is the only pizza that I will eat. Everyone is very friendly and makes you feel like you are a home."}
{"text":"This place is so amazing it inspired me to make my first yelp review! I'm absolutely in love with New York style pizza and always trying to find a place. The pizza here is absolutely amazing! It brought back memories of the most amazing NY street pizza joints! Absolutely amazing! The pizza was great, the wings, the garlic knots and the service! And knowing it's family owned only makes it 1000x better to support a family business. Can't wait to come back :)"}
{"text":"Casanova Bros. is literally the best place on the face of the planet, and I am not embellishing. The food is delicious and the service is better. Tony, who owns the place, is a wonderful man. He is extremely friendly and welcoming. He memorized my name the first time I went in and has remembered me every subsequent time. He has given me free appetizers every time I have gone in and free dessert twice, just because of how much he values making a good impression. 

I LITERALLY NEVER WANT TO EAT ANYWHERE ELSE. The food here could be mediocre and overpriced and I would STILL go here weekly. But the food is amazing, the people are wonderful and the prices are extremely fair. I love this place. 

Please go here. Please give them your money."}
{"text":"Really a great NYC pizza experience!  How many pizza places in AZ will greet you with an authentic \"How U Do-in!\" ala Tony Soprano when you walk in?  Actually we were greeted by Luigi - can't get more Italian than that!  Pizza was just killer and don't miss the garlic knots - yumalicious.  Great place, great fun, we'll be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Found this place by the sheer number of reviews. Like many others, upon entering Casanova Bros, Tony asked if we had been there before. We said no and he immediately introduced himself to my wife and i, shook our hands and hollered back to the staff who then also welcomed us. He gave us half a dozen garlic knots for free, while we reviewed the menu and listened to suggestions. 

The pizza was great - huge slices, nice fresh chewy dough, with the perfect amount of crisp on the bottom. Following our meal, Tony gave us 2 free zeppoli for dessert (also great)!

Customer service is top-notch and the food is wonderful. Even in our short dine-in experience, Tony knew the customers by name coming into the place. It truly felt like a family establishment and it's clear this staff cares about a quality experience, food and otherwise.

We will definitely be back to try more of the menu! Thanks Tony and staff!"}
{"text":"Holy Crap... THIS PLACE IS AMAZING(ly expensive) IN QUAILITY!!!!! Listen, this place is expensive but, is very very worth it! It's everything is good, the employees, the pizza, the everything is good!!! This place is much better than any place ever!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place gets five stars right off the bat due to their service! We eat there sporadically but Tony always recognizes us. The first time we ate there I ordered a small pasta and a side salad. The girl at the counter rang my order up and I took my seat. A minute later, Tony walked up to me and handed me $2 and some change then explained to me that there was a way to make my meal a combo which included a salad and made it cheaper so he was giving me back the difference! Where else can you get amazing customer service like that? The restaurant itself is very clean and casual. The food is very good! I love the fettuccine alfredo and caprese salad! I highly recommend Casanova Bros!"}
{"text":"We went to Casanova brothers for the first time last night and overall it was a pretty good experience. The owner Tony introduced himself and threw in an order of garlic knots for us for free! He was very warm and welcoming. 

We had a pretty large take out order, fried zucchini, wings, large pizza half margarita half white, salad, zappolis and that free order of garlic knots. 
All the food was good but the pizza and garlic knots were definitely the best part of the meal. The white pizza was amazing! Perfect crust and great sauce! The margarita pizza was good too. The garlic knots are a must add to your order! The wings had great flavor and the fried zucchini was average. The zappolis were a perfect desert to end the meal!

The only two complaints  that I have is that the pizza was cold. We put it in our oven and heated it up when we got home. Flavors were on point but after a 5 minute drive home the pizza should have still been warm. And my second complain is that I specifically asked for Extra Italian salad dressing three times while ordering and they forgot to give me any dressing! I was disappointed that I had made it a point to ask for extra and received none!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, good prices, awesome lunch deals. Super friendly staff and always working hard and personable! Highly recommend it. In my OPINION BEST PIZZA IN GILBERT!"}
{"text":"Fantastic family place with great pizza and friendly service. Always get the pizza, and my wife loves the calzones, and unless you are sharing you absolutely don't need a large.

The food is fantastic, but the staff makes this the best pizza place in town."}
{"text":"This restaurant is FABULOUS!!! Mike, Tony, Luigi and staff are GREAT!!! We go somewhat often and they ALWAYS remember our names, even after the first or second visit!! Very customer service-oriented and the food is DELICIOUS!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I rarely eat out due to eating very clean through out the week, so when we go out it is a splurge.  A girl from work told me about Cassanova Bros' pizza.  She said it was awesome, so I convinced my husband to go.  It was a drive from out house but WELL WORTH IT.  I got a white pizza with fresh mozzarella, fresh basil, and tomatoes, spousal unit got neapolitan with sausage, pepperoni, and bacon.  SOOOO GOOD! usually i eat about 2-3 pieces but this pizza I couldn't stop eating it. Fresh, creamy, crunchy, chewy... delicious.  My man killed his entire pizza. Enough said.  We will absolutely be going back.  You should go, place is unassuming, and casual, they will make you feel like you have been going for years and are old friends.  go there."}
{"text":"RECOMMENDATIONS: Go light on the garlic knots, make room for the Margherita Pizza, save space for the Cannolis.

I hear the place is owned by two guys from New York. I've never been to NYC, but the pies they make here are phenomenal.

The customer service is impeccable - Tony manages the front and personally greets the customers - he came by our table and we shared laughs and had a great time!

The pizzas are very large, the portions are very generous. At the end, we were given a free small order of cannolis.

One of the friendliest places I have EVER been to. If only all restaurants and businesses were run like this place!!"}
{"text":"We were greeted like family right from the start!  1st name introductions and complementary garlic knots for our 1st time in!   
We ordered the New York style pizza & a calzone.  Tasted AWESOME!  Great menu choices, clean & inviting decor.  
Great & friendly staff!  Can't wait to dine again!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, first time visiting but certainly not my last and plan on telling everyone I know to go check it out.  Tony, one of the owners was very personable, introducing himself and learning our names and all the wait staff were friendly.  You can tell ingredients are fresh and the ricotta cheese on the white pizza was to die for!  Can't wait to go back and try the pasta!"}
{"text":"This was a great experience from the time I walked in to the time I walked out. Nicole greeted me with a hand shake and we exchanged names. Quickly I noticed that she was on a first name basis with most customers walking in and out. The service and attention to detail continued through my eating experience surrounded by memorbilia of my all time favortie movies (Godfather, Goodfellas, and Sopranos) Service 5 star!! I ordered there slice pizza and it was also fantastic very nice crunch with every bite. Great service + Great quality food= 5 star!"}
{"text":"Mike 2/23/014 a friend told me about this place coming from newyork this is the closest to newyork taste they got a new customer im gonna tell my friends about this place"}
{"text":"I used to love this place when I had a place just down the street a few years ago.
Recently called to order a medium Sicilian (twenty five dollars by the way).
Both the toppings & the extra cheese we paid for were light to unrecognizable on the pie & the pizza was not as good as I remember (couldn't say exactly why, just disappointed).  But the biggest turn off was the 'new' help.  The gal on the phone when ordering seemed impatient & confused (high?), this was at 3pm on a weekday by the way.  When entering I was immediately disgusted by what I assume was the same lady -resembling something from a nightmare before christmas or a kiss concert.= scary.  And her bad attitude when I presented my -god forbid- American Express Card was unwarranted, but not surprising at that point.  Needless to say, no gratuity was given.  I do not believe that we will be going back."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza/Italian place by far. Their whole menu is great. The white pizza is addicting, i get at least one slice every visit. The owner is pretty awesome too. This place is a must try."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere feels very Italian! Very clean! The employees customer service is beyond outstanding! The pizza pie is DELICIOUS! Must try the white pizza pie!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down some of the best pizza I've had. The employees were very friendly and greeted me as soon as I walked in. This was my first time there so I was unsure what to get and the employees all recommended their favorites. While the family enjoyed the pizza and the wings, it was refreshing to get genuine people who enjoyed what they're doing."}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved to Gilbert from Massachusetts. We visited this restaurant after reading rave reviews on Yelp and our expectations were still exceeded. Right through the door we were greeted by Tony and Noah as they identified us as \"first timers.\" As such, we received free garlic knots that were enough to bring me back. We ordered what Tony recommended - half white pizza with spinach and sausage, half red deluxe. There was a minor mishap with our order but they immediately rectified it - and some. I can't wait for their new, larger location across the street (with beer and wine!). Tony and his crew made us feel at home in our new town and we can't wait to come back every Friday night for our \"pizza night.\""}
{"text":"Very good. Complimentary garlic knots for it being our first visit. The calzone was one of the best I've ever had.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"OK I admit their Pizza is fantastic, but until you have tried the pasta or Cannolis they are the best in the west.  So if your a fan of New York and miss the Italian quarter, come to Casanova's Pizza, \"Forget About It\" you wont find any better in gilbert."}
{"text":"I spent the majority of my life in the North East.  Well, coming from the NE, I really do miss two things, pizza and the ocean.  After finding Casanova Brothers Pizza, I only now miss the ocean.  SERIOUSLY, this pizza is the REAL DEAL.  It's obvious that the ingredients are fresh and high quality, as the taste is amazing.  The restaurant is clean and the service is over the top friendly.  I even know the names of the owners after one visit, Tony and Mike!  They'll take good care of you and feed you well.  We will be back and thanks for giving me a \"slice\" of home!"}
{"text":"I get a pizza here at least once every couple of months. The pizza is reliably good and the service is fantastic. The owners clearly care about what they are doing. The quality of the pizzas coupled with the great service more than justify the slightly higher prices here. I highly recommend the white pizza!"}
{"text":"I just have to say this is by far the best pizza place in arizona coming from new York the owner toni has it on point! I would recommend this place to everyone"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great pizza and the staff get to know the customers. The entire staff is warm and friendly. We have been going here for years! Don't forget to order the garlic knots!"}
{"text":"Went 2 days in a row when if found this gem recently. Damn good food and good people. Support this local family's delicious pizza shop, you will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"This review is long overdue.  I Love this place!  Their food is delicious and their customer service is outstanding.  I was so happy with my experience here I wrote to the AZ Republic and they published an article about it.  See article here:  http://www.azcentral.com/story/money/business/consumer/call-12-for-action/2014/08/03/casanova-star-service/13556049/"}
{"text":"Food is good not worth the prices. Waited forever for my food, ordered a few slices of pizza a salad and some garlic knots that didn't taste fresh. Overall not going back"}
{"text":"Truly the BEST New York Pizza!!  Tony and Family make you feel like you're part of the family, very friendly and so very Kind.  So grateful they brought their business to the Valley : )  We'll never go anywhere else for a Pizza, and the service is awesome A+  
Their Menu is really Great!!"}
{"text":"Best pie in AZ! Friendly staff very clean and good bar. The owners know everyone's name and greet you as soon as step in the door."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Casanova Bro. Pizza. Tony and the staff were very friendly.  Knowing it was our first time there,  Tony asked if we would like suggestions on the menu .. His suggestions were greatly appreciated.  Loved the garlic knots.  The dipping sauce was spot on!  Best I've tasted!  The restaurant was very clean and that's important to me.  I can't wait to go back and try a few different items on the menu!  Looking forward to introducing Casanova Bro. Pizza  to our friends!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for something different but a little piece of Italy, I highly recommend you stop in and see Tony and crew....


Great food and great customer service"}
{"text":"I was in NYC in June of this year.  Even eating in little Italy and some highly recommended pizza places, the pizza didn't compare to this place.  Save te airfare!  My family will be making this a monthly night out."}
{"text":"First off, the service is awesome. The owner greeted us right away and asked if I'd been there before(I hadn't). As I told him it was my first time, he offered some garlic knots on the house for a first time visit. We ordered a simple pepperoni pizza. It came out promptly and my boys and I devoured it quickly. My boys raved about how good it was. We will be back. Looking forward to try some of the awesome dishes the other patrons were eating."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first experience with Casanova Bros and it was amazing.  I called for take-out and went and picked it up.  i was greeted by the owner and was treated as if he knew me all along.  He was gracious, poilte and I really was impressed.  After I got home with my pizza (and my free knots since it was my first time) I have to say I was impressed AGAIN.  What a great pizza from a really great local business at a great price and therefore this is where I will be getting my weekly pizza from.  All in all I am SO HAPPY that this is a local business in Gilbert because I always want to support my local residents first.  Thanks for the awesome experience and I will be back."}
{"text":"I feel like I'm part of the family when I walk in here, food is really good I love the garlic knots my mouth is watering as I'm typing this review!"}
{"text":"Best NY pizza and wings in Arizona! The owner, Tony, greets you when you walk in, shakes your hand and asks your name. He personally
makes rounds around the restaurant frequently to check on his guests. This guy is so nice I will be coming back just because of his hospitality. This guy knows business...and pizza. The pizza was cooked perfectly. Crust was perfect texture and thickness. True NY style pizza in AZ. Love love love it! Well worth the 25 minute drive from my house. We will be coming back often."}
{"text":"Was in Mesa and stumbled upon Casanova Bros.!  Tony was so welcoming and made us feel like family!  Food was delicious and served quickly!  Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"As soon as I walked through the door I felt welcomed by Tony and I think it was his brother, but I forget his name. Both smiled brightly and said hello. Tony made it a point to ask my name and ask if I had been there before. Most restaurants could care less, but Tony took time to make me feel welcome. As I sat waiting for my food Tony offered me some Garlic knots, which I usually dont like, but these were exceptionally good. The sauce or Sugo is what made them. Im partial to the right ingredients and flavor of Sugo considering my cooking background and experience as a kitchen manager at an italian restaurant.  I was pleased by the flavor of the food and the ambiance.  Im also partial to Goodfellas, which was one of the the many movies highlighted on the walls. Tony made every attempt possible to ask me how everything was and I noticed he did this  with everyone who came in. He would ask their name amd intro himself . It was nice to really see an entrepreneur work at building relationships with everyone, not just those whom he recognized. The place was neeat and the mens bathroon was clean. First things I look at are air vents, fans, and bathrooms. If they're dirty, I dont eat there. Everything was up to par and I enjoyed my slices of Pepperoni pizza. Quite a delight to find this little gem. I will be back to visit with Tony and to try many of the other menu options. Thanks Tony for being such a great host and  delivering a great slice of pie. Please tell the kitchen manager he's doin a great job!"}
{"text":"As soon as you walk in,  everyone greets you with gusto.  Tony,  the owner,  is so personable greeting everyone like a friend visiting his home.  We got a white pizza and it was stellar!  The crust was light,  airy, buttery with the most perfect flavor a crust should be.  We will definitely be repeat customers!"}
{"text":"The pizza was incredible and the service was even better. I took my family for dinner, we were greeted by the owner and given garlic knots, he made sure we were taken care of and we will certainly be back with this level of excellent customer service and attention to detail second to none"}
{"text":"We used to frequent this place when it was in the strip mall. When they moved to the larger location the service went down the drain. Went in with a party of six and all of our meals came at different times There was about 45 minutes from the time the first person got their meal to the time the last of us got ours. When we told the mgr all we received was excuses and not even an apology. What a disappointment."}
{"text":"If you haven't eaten here then what are you waiting for? My husband and I have eaten here twice. This is a great pizza joint with all the ultimate and typical pizza joint fares. i have eaten pizza a lot of places and this is one of my top ten. We ate there once with my parents, I had it at work once, and once by ourselves. This place is a great neighborhood pizza joint and they have some really tasty food. The owners are always so nice and after only being here once with way to much time passing between they still remember me and my husband. (he's 6'7, very hard to miss)

Our first visit they gave the table garlic knots for free. Oh man they were good and we had to order more. those were quickly eaten and it was nice to socialize between courses. The pizza came out and it was piping hot and was demolished quickly because we were hungry. This is not the the place to take people who pick at their food. The owners came by and asked us each separately how our pizza was and we told them how much we liked it. My dad was so quiet which is high recommendations from him because he was enjoying the pizza. He and my husband gladly finished off the huge pizza after my mom and I asked them. they then gave us free zeppolis and that was enjoyable.

My husband and I came back after a night of well adult fun. We woke up late, wanted to have breakfast but it was more like lunch on a Sunday. we drove around and we settled in on Casanova brothers. They had just opened and I think we were the third people to come in. It smelled so good in there. We ordered some garlic knots and a pizza. My husband and I ate all the knots and I wanted more. We got the cheesy garlic bread and it was delicious. it was well worth the gym visit later that day. We got our pizza delivered to our table straight from the oven and I had one slice and my husband ate 3. We took the rest home and they gave us free zeppolis again. This place rocks! My hubby took the slices for lunch the next day and reported the pizza was great the next day as well.

It is a nice place, great staff and the owners are so sweet. We love going there just to look at the heavily decorated walls of New York. It's a place you really feel like you're part of this huge Casanova family and that's a good thing."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT customer service!!! Tony, the owner, was incredible; very welcoming and made me feel very special. He was social and friendly with EVERY customer who walked through the door. I would rate the food about a 2.5-3 stars, but the amazing customer service made up for the lack of food quality/taste. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The food and customer service here was amazing, however if I had used the restroom before I ate, I would have walked right back out. Toilet, sink, light switch were filthy! Makes me wonder about the kitchen. :("}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for the first time for lunch. It was very nice to be greeted at the door by Tony, we felt very welcome. The pizza was amazing and the staff was very friendly. We will be back. Thanks Tony."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I have been nearly home sick working out here. But this place made it all better."}
{"text":"In search of good NY PIZZA in Arizona, we ended up based on YELP reviews at Casanova Brothers Pizza. Excellent pizza, fettuccini Alfredo and cannoli. Will be back again. If only they served beer....."}
{"text":"Great Pizza and Garlic Knots. Definitely compares to the pizza I used to get in Bay Ridge Brooklyn. The sandwiches are great as well. Some places in the area claim to use Boars Head meat and don't. These guys do and it makes the sub outstanding! We need to try rest of the menu, but so far I'm very pleased."}
{"text":"Great staff, Tony (one of the owners) met us right away and asked us if we have been there before and welcomed us.  He offered some free garlic knock and it was very good.  The food was very tasty. Before we left, he gave us some free desert also.  We did go back with many more guest and they all had a good time and the food was what was expected."}
{"text":"Fantastic service, super friendly and really good food. I travel 40 minutes to get a taste of the east coast food that I miss so much lol"}
{"text":"As others have noted, the service is what makes this place stand out - very personable staff.

The pizza is great - on the lines of NY style.  I saw pasta dishes walking by - haven't tried yet, but they look extremely tempting."}
{"text":"I would return just based on customer service alone but the food is awesome too! I won't go anywhere else for pizza from now on :)"}
{"text":"Since moving to Mesa recently, I needed to find an excellent Italian restaurant. Through Yelp, I found this little Pizza/Pasta restaurant. With high expectations of their food and service, I went in and was greeted by the manager with his name, who gave me on-the-house garlic knots for it being my first time. He showed me the lunch specials and was very happy to see the prices that low (I'm an incoming college freshman and money is tight). 

The place itself was designed to be a fast food/dine-in environment. I got my food quickly after sitting down; first the salad then the entrée. The salad was fresh and the pizza slice I ordered was very large and absolutely SUPERB. I was then further pleased by the second mile service I received by the table check-ins. 

Five stars easily. This restaurant deserves a chance, and I think you'll be well surprised. I'll definitely become a regular:)"}
{"text":"This place really is our favorite little family friendly restaurant. Whenever we have out-of-town guests we ALWAYS make a point to take them here. Not only is the food awesome, but the owners & atmosphere are fantastic! This place really is a little gem & must try!"}
{"text":"Staff is so kind and friendly, pizza is amazing. Definitely in the top 5 pizza best places in AZ."}
{"text":"Very good Pizza.  Crispy crust and thin crust.  First time in restaurant was given 6 knots and they were very good. Perfect amount of butter and garlic.  Saucy for dipping knots was OK nothing special.  Also given dessert for coming in.  Staff was so friendly and introduced us to cooks.  Shook our hands and welcomed us.  We will be back."}
{"text":"You have the best service and welcoming experience I've ever experienced. I love that it's loud and the workers are having a good time, it makes me feel like I'm at home and my kids can be themselves. The lasagna and chicken parmesan is waaay better than Michaelangelos..."}
{"text":"A great place for pizza. I ordered the Neapolitan style crust and it did not disappoint.  My wife ordered the Caprese salad and it not only had a great presentation but tasted great. We got there a little before 5 on a Friday and the service was excellent. Tony came to our table a couple of times to make nice and the server was very good. The only disappointing item was the soda and water had an after taste. Filter?"}
{"text":"Lasagna was awesome.  Baked Ziti was great too.  Love this place. The service is always impeccable and the food is great."}
{"text":"The customer service here is amazing. I've never been treated so well. Tony takes the time to introduce himself and learns your name. He says goodbye to everyone that leaves and says their name. He gives you a side of garlic knots on the house (the sauce is incredible). I haven't even had the food yet and I already know I am coming back. This is how a business should be ran."}
{"text":"Great pizza and cheese garlic knots! Had the fried zucchini also very good staff was nice and friendly on the phone and when we pick up our order. Will be back again!!!!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here by complete mistake just this last weekend. I was in town to see my brother who lives just up the street and I was absolutely starving, so I popped in and figured I'd get a slice to hold me over till dinner.. First off, amazing customer service. I could not believe how well my wife and I were being treated. I literally had to pinch myself. This type of customer service still exists!?! The man asked my name (I think his name was Lou but I don't recall), he shook my hand and was ecstatic that it was my first time in to the restaurant. He gave me some garlic bites for free while I waited for our food to be ready.

Then Lou called in to the back of the house and asked for a status on our order.. Then he turned to me and said.. \"Which car is yours?\" and I pointed to my truck out front and he says.. \"No problem I'll bring your food out to you as soon as it's ready\" So I head out to my truck and I wait a few minutes.. Lou pops out with our food and comes to the passenger side window. He thanked us again for stopping by and asked how the garlic bites were. We were still in shock from being treated so well inside, now he's at my truck window and didn't miss a beat. 

We were so hungry we just pulled over in the parking lot and got to work eating the slices.. The pizza was fantastic. Usually when you buy a slice somewhere it's some flaccid greasy mess. But not at Casanova's. The mozzarella was great quality, the sauce you could tell was made fresh, and the crust was crisp on the bottom and just right all the way through to the end - not burnt, not too undercooked, not tough or soggy. 

Seriously if you're in Gilbert and you're near this restaurant go in and get a slice just to try it. You won't be disappointed. I'll definitely be back. This is the only place I've found in the valley doing pizza right AND customer service right."}
{"text":"Tony greeted me the second I walked in. I was in kind of a hurry you got two slices to me within 5 minutes and they were outstanding. Authentic corner shop feel, I highly recommend Casanova brothers pizza."}
{"text":"As a native New Yorker, I have been on the hunt for a real NY restaurant ever since I lived in the Midwest. This place tastes and feels like NY. Baby, I'm home!

With signed mobster and Sinatra photos dotting the restaurant wall, you're greeted by Tony who is always sure to ask your name.

My husband and I split a large sausage, peppers and onion calzone topped with marinara sauce. Outstanding!

After feeling satisfied, Tony gave use some free dessert of little balls of fried dough with powdered sugar. A deliciously unhealthy treat, but eaten without the guilt.

Go there now lunch or dinner. Now!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite restaurant!! Tony is number 1 with providing professionalism and customer service. Since the first time I walked into his small pizzeria, to the new Grand opening of his new location, he has treated me like a family member!! 
 On top of Casanova's great service, the food is top Notch! Starting with the garlic knots, to the Pizza, and everything in-between, your appetite with be quenched.
Honestly I can only find positive things about this place, go in and give them a shot....you won't be let down!!"}
{"text":"How can I give this place more stars? The service was the best I've ever experienced and the pizza was fantastic. I'll be back. I'm stuffed and I can't wait to come back for more."}
{"text":"This place has the best pizza! And there customer service is amazing! I would hands down recommend this place if you love NY pizza!"}
{"text":"We've been coming here, regularly, for a long time. The owners are incredibly nice and personable. They make a huge effort to memorize every customers name. Oh... and their food is fantastic."}
{"text":"Knots on the house and \"Louie\" could not have treated us better! What a great place.  The reviews don't lie.  The wings, zucchini and \"knots on the house were awesome!  Pizza coming but I am guessing good stuff!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Owner and son running the front end, so friendly, kept thanking patrons for their visit and apologizing for the wait (they were extra busy tonight). They handed out free soda to all those waiting. Give free app to new customers and shake your hand. Great customer service!"}
{"text":"If you want to feel like you a part of a community, go to Casanova's. Run by a family that cares about getting to know it's customers and displays an uncanny ability to remember names. It's definitely a staple in the area that you don't want to miss. The prices are right and the food is good."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Their garlic knots were so good! The owner was so welcoming and even asked what everyone's name was so he could try and remember it!"}
{"text":"I love this place. You'll be warmly greeted by the staff / owners, served quickly and you just feel like your a part of this place.

To be honest, I would still come here if they weren't so nice to me. I love the pizza. I prefer to call ahead for pickup so I can take it back and devour it in private. Cannoli's are spot on. Baked Ziti is okay - I've had better. Pizza is amazing. Garlic knots are okay - I've had better. Pizza is addicting."}
{"text":"Ok first time here and have to say the staff and owner Tony are amazing. Felt very personal and always spoke to you by name. Pizza was super good definitely worth the visit."}
{"text":"Very nice owners, accommodating and makes you feel at home. The food on the other hand was ok."}
{"text":"I have been on a quest, since moving to Arizona, to find NY Style Pizza. Other places just add \"NY Style\" to their storefront, but fail to deliver. I tried 1 slice with Xtra cheese and meatballs...and I literally pictured myself walking in NYC eating a slice of NY Pizza. They delivered on their claim and the service was wonderful! Two thumbs way up!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in town! I love that the guys remember everyone's name and bring out free garlic knots and desert for the first timers."}
{"text":"Went to Casanovas only because I had some time to kill before my hair appointment next door.  I just moved to AZ from FL about 6 months ago and STILL had not found anywhere good for pizza.  I ordered the white pizza with onions....OH MY WOW!!!  It was definitely the best pizza in AZ, maybe the best I have ever had.  Luigi was incredibly friendly and made sure I was good.  Great food, great people!  My new favorite place!"}
{"text":"What a great experience!!! Tony made my family and I very welcomed and enjoyed the warm friendly reception coupled with a great atmosphere. I finally found a place that can give outstanding service and delicious food. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"this place is awesome. food is fantastic  service is outstanding and tony is an awesome  guy. makes you feel like part of the family."}
{"text":"Casanova Brothers was a solid 4 1/2 before they moved; now they are a solid  5. The addition of beer and wine puts them over the top. They have awesome food, and with the addition of table service the experience is even better."}
{"text":"This place was recommended from my boyfriends co-wokers. Said this place had the best pizza. He was right. 

When you get there the guys ask your name and give you some their garlic knots which are AMAZING! The guy are so polite and nice. As our first time there we had to look at the menu for a bit. As we were standing there other customers were coming in and ordering. He greeted everyone by name even the kids that were coming in. It feels very homey and so nice going into the store. 

When we finally got to ordering I had a few questions to ask especially about what I should get. I got the special that they had that day pizza and salad. My boyfriend went all out and got a full sized calzone. We had to wait a few minutes for his food but when it got there it was HUGE! It was delicous. THere was so much meat and filling that I should have just ate that with him. In the end he only got through about 1/3 of it. 

I made the mistake of getting dessert as well. Now its not a bad mistake on their part just mine mind you. I thought that one slice of pizza and a salad wasn't enough but once I got the tiramisu it was so rich and moist and just plain great that I regretted eating the pizza and salad because I was so full that I couldn't eat it all. 

I was sad that I did not get to try thr wings because I love hot wings. The trek from tempe to gilbert was well worth the time and plan on going again. There is a reason they are top rated! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Wow! First time in tonight and blown away.. And I have high expectations as I manage a small business in the food industry. Very clean and welcoming. Tony greeted us and remembered our names and genuinely welcomed us. Everything is homemade and you can tell! We tried the lasagna and the chicken parm. Delicious!! Yes it was $30 but I'd much rather spend $30 here than some unoriginal dish from Olive Garden."}
{"text":"Tony and Louis Were fantastic, First time in and they greeted us and gave us the greatest service ever. Our kids had a great time and the food was amazing. 

Highly recommend, oh and the food.. True New York style and and absolutely great pizza."}
{"text":"First time I tried Casanova Bros. Right after being seated, the owner came over and introduced himself. Since it was my first time here, i was offered free garlic knots. They were amazing! The pizza was New York style, and was absolutely delicious! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First time here? You are greeted with a smile and warmth from Tony.
   Tony says, \"ya gotta try the 1/2 white and 1/2 red pizza.\" I am ready to hit the door, know what I mean? White pizza? Ok already! I try it! My wife,  she tried it. Exceptional! Being from Chicagoland I preferred the red pizza. Wife of course, preferred the white. Tasty seasonings,  nothing overbearing."}
{"text":"i just wanted to let people know that this place is not what a lot of the reviews say it is! i ordered fettuccine alfredo it had no taste a plate of noodles in sauce with no flavor  a very small salad that looked like someone just plopped it in a small plate the tomatoes looked like they where wilted . the bread that received wasn't warmed up! the butter was individually in little containers and the ice tea tasted like it had soap in it very disgusted with this place  $40 for food that was very poor quality it seemed like i was at a fast food drive thru-that was very slow!! no flavor what so ever!"}
{"text":"The owner is super friendly. Being from Brooklyn Ive had some of the best real NY pizza and for Arizona this place is one of two that comes the closest. The square is very good-it's got good cheese not junk. The garlic knots are a little too \"doughy\" like they need something more- maybe more olive oil and more minced garlic. The sauce is very good. The regular slice is pretty good although I prefer a little thinner with a very crispy bottom and more olive oil on top. But all in all a good place."}
{"text":"Every time I visit Tony (the owner) is always there and greets us like family. The food is always amazing and priced great. The staff is always friendly and helpful. You can't go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"Its not just one of the best pizzas I've had in Phoenix,  its the friendliest and best experience I've had in any restaurant, of any type, in the area.  They make you feel like a regular and the genuinely appreciate and are glad to have you in their restaurant. They want to know your name and treat every customer as a friend..  Everyone has their opinion on their favorite pizza, but Casanova Brothers not only make a great pie.. they know how to treat their customers.  Many business should take a class from the owners of Casanova Brothers when it comes to customer service... Made me and my family feel like family...  A++"}
{"text":"These guys do it right, hands down, best NY pizza in Arizona! Tony is an amazing guy, no matter how long between visits, always remembers my family and I! You feel home when you come in this place. Tonight I had a miscommunication about the pizza I wanted, didn't catch it till I got home, called them up, talked to Tony and he gave me the right pizza at no charge! They do pizza right and customer service right! I'd give them 10 stars if I could! Drop what you are doing and get to this place NOW!!"}
{"text":"Dined in for the first time today, had a sub and fried zucchini, yummy!  Can't wait to try the pizza next.  Impressed that the man who took our order introduced himself, gave us a free order of garlic knots (I didn't try them because I don't like garlic but my lunch date loved them!) and remembered our names the entire time we were there."}
{"text":"i had not been in on over 3 months I walk in and the owner remembers me by first name!!! needless to say the pizza was awesome and service even better!!!! great pizza and incredible service... family owned and operated!!! great establishment!!!"}
{"text":"First time having Casanova Bro, placed a pickup order which included their Medium Hot Wings, Garlic Knots, Sicilian, and reg pizza.  Flavors reminds me a of a New Jersey style pizza...truly tasty and enjoyed by all. Will definitely be making this place my go pizza night."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant! Louie asked our names and introduced himself, and kept checking to make sure we enjoyed our dinner. Food was fantastic, my hubby and I got an order of baked ziti and a calzone to share, and Louie sent an order of garlic knots to our table since it was our first time here.  We are looking forward to making this one of go to restaurants."}
{"text":"Without a doubt,  I received some of the best service I've ever had at any restaurant. Tony does business the right way and clearly takes pride in his food and serving the customer. 

The white and new york pizza were both served with fresh, premium ingredients, and I would have a difficult time naming a better tasting pizza than this one. The garlic knots were also fantastic and Tony was more than happy to let us try those. He explained the menu and gave us excellent reccomendations based upon our tastes.

I'm new to the Phoenix area and have been craving pizza as good as the places in my hometown. I've tried numerous places since arriving here a few months ago. It was my first time eating there this evening and I certainly will be back many times to come, possibly tomorrow. And the next day."}
{"text":"This place is over HYPED, the pizza was ok NOT great. If you're looking for a place to sit and chill out , it's a good spot to do just that."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Great owners, they make you feel like they know you personally every time. You can't go wrong with this place.  Has indoor seating for a more formal eating experience. It can get a little hot inside during the summer or day time is my only complaint, but I typically order to go, so it doesn't bother me much. You have to try this place! Delicious."}
{"text":"I'm really disappointed that I live so far away from this spot. Swung by with the wife, I loved it and so did she (and she's preggo & super picky). Place had a ton of people in and out, good sign. If you live nearby this is the perfect place to grab some pizza and wings for pick up...literally saw about 20 people do that while we had our slices. Also the staff is super nice and friendly."}
{"text":"My husband and I really like the pizza here. It is delicious and not greasy like some pizza chains can be. They always make an effort to remember you if you've been in before and many times it will be one of the owners themselves handing you your pizza. They will soon be moving across the parking lot to a larger space which is nice because they didn't have much seating previously, although we usually take our pizza home so it didn't make too much of a difference to us."}
{"text":"I don't know why I didn't like it before, but I LOVE it now.  Hmmmmm. Don't know why,but it's just really yummy, filling pizza.  My kids lovethe ravioli but at $10 for 7 small raviolis it's a rip off.  And, i always have to choose which child is my favorite of the night -- who gets 4 ravs, while the other gets 3.  Wish there was a kids menu with an even number of raviolis :-)"}
{"text":"We live in California and visit relatives in  Chandler.  
We always dine here when in town.  Wouldn't miss it.
Chichi"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had since moving out here and the knots yum. The staff is very nice and  work efficient. Tony makes sure your updated while waiting for your pick up he's one hell of a guy. Would definitely tell anybody to visit this place if your in Gilbert. Haven't tried any others things on the menu but I'm sure amazing."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Best pizza in Gilbert, Better service! And Tony is the man, always greeting me with a smile and a \"Thanks for coming, come back soon!\"

One Nibble, everyone knows the laws, we try them all until we've had them all! Tough to grade when you're such a big fan of the owner, but I won't be partial just bc this is my favorite place 7.3, best pizza I've had in Arizona."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan after my one visit.

This is a small, neighborhood Italian pizza place tucked a little out of the way.  The prices are reasonable and the place definitely isn't dressy.  The owner really does greet everyone who comes in like family and a lot of people by name.  He seemed to make a big deal of asking and using people's names so either he is really good at memorizing or people are repeat customers.

We had pizza.  It was really good New York style.  They have a few creative types of pizza on the menu, but we didn't try them.  I'm a native of NYC (a long time ago) so I tend to want pizza that sticks to the basics.  That they nailed.  We didn't have dessert or anything like that as a lot of other reviewers do, because, well, its a pizza place.  Actually, its probably becoming more of an Italian Restaurant, and if so you probably can have dessert, but to me its a neighborhood pizza place, and for that it got 5 stars."}
{"text":"Was  craving a big new York slice and the reviews weren't kidding- my first time here and Tony and the crew treated me like family everyone greeted me with warm friendly smiles and hello's. Then after ordering I was given yummy garlic knots on the house for being a first timer, I can't wait to get home to eat my pie but I gotta tell ya other restaurants can learn from these guys with how accommodating and friendly they are and they make each guest feel important! I WILL FORSURE BE A REGULAR  HERE!!! THANKS GUYS KEEP UP THE AMAZING WORK!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome people and awesome food. Definitely one of my favorite piazza joints in the valley."}
{"text":"Great East Coast style pizza here, with a strong side of personal service.  Very friendly and nice ownership, goes out of their way to make you feel special.  And the pizza is super!"}
{"text":"We're new to AZ and went here for the 1st time tonight and wow... and the hospitality was out of this world! Tony made us feel so welcome and treated us like family! The food and service were perfect too. I can't say enough good things. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Was there last night for dinner. Pretty nice place. Friendly environment. Will be back again. Really liked the idea that they gave us baby bread sticks being a first timer. :)"}
{"text":"The ABSOLUTE BEST Pizza I have had since I moved from New York to Arizona hands down! I love ordering from here. It's the closest tasting to home that I have had in years. Good pizza, good hot subs. Absolutely love that they have eggplant parmigiana heroes, I get one every time. Cannot stress enough how this is the place to get your pizza and heroes from."}
{"text":"Service: Since it was our first time, we requested a menu to have a look and they give us 6 garlic knots with sauce to sample. These were very delicious and totally got us revved up for what to order for our meal. When ordering, the employee that took our order gave a shout out that it was our first time there and the entire staff greeted us with a warm welcome. Throughout our meal, the staff was very attentive to our needs and we had a very good meal.

Environment: The music and feel of the place is very nice. It's very family-friendly, and although we didn't have our kids with us at this time, my wife and I felt it had that nice vibe. The place was very clean and it was a very relaxing environment to be in for our date night.

Food: We ordered fried zucchini, chicken alfredo and a neapolitan style pepperoni pizza. The ranch accompanying the zucchini was very good, with the right creamy texture. The zucchini itself had a deliciously-seasoned batter and it was a very good appetizer. Our alfredo came with a salad and they went ahead and split the portion into two so that my wife and I could easily share. The caesar dressing was very good and I definitely recommend that salad. 

My favorite part was definitely the Alfredo dish. It was seriously so dang good; best Alfredo I have ever had. They make their own sauce and I could not stop eating it! I highly recommend that dish to anyone curious on what to order. 

The pizza was also very good, with the crust at that right \"crispy shell but soft interior\" texture. The sauce and toppings, particularly the cheese were all great-tasting and complemented each other well.

All in all, I am eager to try everything else here at this place. It is now my favorite Italian restaurant and I will hype it up to all of my friends."}
{"text":"One of the best New York style pizza places around, I go every week and it's just the best!!"}
{"text":"Looked up best pizza in Gilbert and this had a 4.8 star rating. Decided to try it and it was a very good choice. I've had it a couple of time now. The customer service was exceptional and then we got the pizza. Thin crust pizza and the sauce they use is very good. Found out the owners are from New York as well! Very good!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, have been going there for years.  Honestly this would have been more than a 5 star rating at the old location, but the service isn't as good at the new location.  Honestly they deserved a 2 for my latest experience, but I used an average to get to 4.  If something goes wrong Tony the owner tries to make it right.  I've talked to a few friends who have been loyal repeat customers for years and they all agreed service has declined.  I hope to see Tony and the team return this to the once great restaurant it was.

Overall food is great, new location is beautiful, the owner doesn't interact with the tables like he used to which was a huge bonus, did I mention the food is great?"}
{"text":"It's been a month since my first review and I just wanted to add that the lasagna is fantastic!  We've been back 4 times to try different dishes and haven't been disappointed yet.  For pizza or pasta, Casanova Brothers is truly a 5-star Italian dining experience!"}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas I have ever had. Tony is the best, very nice and hospitable, just his friendly presence makes me want to come back! The pizza tho, just awesome, love the white pizza and the red sauce. Do yourself a favor, go here and have a great time and even better food!"}
{"text":"By far the best pizza place in Arizona!! The service alone sets this place apart from any other business. Amazing customer service, everyone makes you feel like you're apart of the family and always welcomed/taken care of. Tony is the man!!! Aside from the outstanding service, the food follows with a 5 star as well. You will not be disappointed with the Casanova Brothers!!!"}
{"text":"Had my birthday dinner here with the family and it was wonderful! The food was very good and the entire staff made us feel right at home. Can't wait to go back for seconds already! Thank you everyone for the wonderful evening :)"}
{"text":"The owner and his family makes it a point to ask for your name and shake your hand. Very family oriented and friendly!!! Nice touch :) First time visitors receive garlic knots on the house. 

Pizza was outstanding. Loved the sauce and bread. The crust was crispy yet light and fluffy. Ordered cannolis to go since we were so full after dinner. Loved every bite. Keep up the good food, we'll see you soon!"}
{"text":"Food was good, but the service makes them stand apart from the rest! Great job Casanova Pizza!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I have had in Arizona since moving here from New York in '07.  The personal touch the owners put into their work is refreshing.

The pizza is beyond delicious and always consistent.  

The garlic knots are real good as noted in other reviews.

I have gone to this restaurant a couple dozen times and the pizza is also  better when you dine in.  Pizza is always better hot haha.

Do yourself a favor and order extra cheese-well done."}
{"text":"Super delicious pizza. Came here for the first time and the owner Tony introduced himself to me. They gave me garlic knots and zepoli to try. The pizza was thin and crunchy and just how I like it. I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and friendly service at great prices.  The pizza was incredible, the wings are good enough that they could have their own franchise based on just them, and the garlic knots were delicious.  Definitely will be coming back and definitely will be recommending to others!"}
{"text":"I am in awe that such a fine and very well skilled people who makes the best pizzas are in this little corner in Val Vista and Guadalupe. Who wouldv'e thought, right?! 
My family were craving for pizza that day so my husband told me to yelp a pizza parlor. I came across this with 216 reviews and 4 stars! So we drove to this place right away. We were greeted with smiling faces and Tony (owner) even asked for our names--not a regular thing to do nowadays. So anyways, we were seated, Tony went thru the whole menu with us and even gave us Garlic Knots for free! First timers get these for free! It was awesome! :) anyways, we had a great time. My kids loved their pizza. I personally loved their NY style pizza and my hubby loved the white sauce kind. We did basil, garlic, and sausage for the white sauce pizza---HEAVEN! 

So guys, visit this place.. You will not regret it. 

THANK YOU, TONY AND CREW!"}
{"text":"Heard this was the best pizza in the east valley,  they definitely did not disappoint!!!  Our first time in and we got the deep dish Sicilian and was one of,  if not the best,  pizzas we have had!  The new location is really nice every one was friendly and made you feel like family.  We will be coming back and bringing friends and family! !"}
{"text":"Tony treated us like family and the Pizza is 
Awesome and if it matters I'm a New Yorker.
I know Pizza!"}
{"text":"Just moved into the neighborhood and had a hankerin' for some pizza. I ordered takeout; a large Neapolitan pie 30 minutes before closing. I arrived early and was pleasantly greeted. The gal shook my hand, welcomed me to the neighborhood and offered a free dessert as a first time customer. 
The pizza was hot, tasty and hit the spot! They have a loyal customer. I'm looking forward to trying other menu items."}
{"text":"Great guys.  They remember your name 9 times out of 10.  Food is amazing.  It is by far the closest thing to NY pizza in the valley and I have tried them all.  Family business and you can tell that they care.  I love to go in there.  They are always busy and it makes me happy knowing that a family business can still thrive in corporate America."}
{"text":"Ok, first of all we have been unpacking our boxes since we just moved into town from Oregon. Needless to say, I'm not quite ready to cook. Right when we walked into the door the owner Tony greeted us and introduced himself. We were seated and the owners son Noah who is also super gracious waited on us. We were offered an appetizer of their awesome Garlic Knots. Super yummy with freshly grated fluffy parmesan. The fettuccini alfredo is delicious! My 13 yr. old daughter ordered the caprese and wings which were quickly devoured and she stated this is her favorite restaurant ever!! My husband ordered the large meat ravioli with alfredo and it was super delish!! We were super full but had to try a cannoli and it did not disappoint. What a lucky find!! We will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"I have loved Casanova's ever since trying it over two years ago. My husband and I had just moved into the neighborhood and decided to try it. We have not regretted that decision. The moment we walked in, Tony greeted us and asked for our names.  He has remembered us ever since. I love their garlic knots and their pizza is fabulous. If I am not in the mood for pizza, I usually get a calzone with ham and pineapple but all of their dishes are delicious. My husband loves the lasagna and baked ziti. I recently had our first child and Casanova's was one of the places I craved (especially their garlic knots). I have never had anything I did not like at Casanova's. 
We recently moved to Apache Junction and miss being able to pick up Casanova's and take it home. We still try to make it to see Tony and the gang though. If you have not tried Casanova's yet, you are missing out."}
{"text":"If you would have asked before my last visit I would have given Casanova Bothers a 6/5 star rating. Last night was my first visit to the new bigger location and from what I experienced they should have stayed in the old location. We pulled in the place and it was a little over half full. We asked for a table for two and were told there would be a wait or we could sit at the empty bar. We said ok but we walked past a good 8 tables 4 of which were two tops that were vacant. We asked the hostess if we could sit at one of those and she was like we are saving those incase we have a big party come in, which is a stupid reason to refuse customers that are there. One of the tables was a two top in the corner that even if a big party came in would have been of no use. We sat down at the bar and waited looking at the half empty room joking as to why we had to sit at the bar. The bar tender was running around with his head chopped off as several other staff members did nothing. The blonde that looks mike the Aussie chick from pitch perfect did nothing the entire night. She just wondered around and tried to look busy it was pretty fun to watch her try and look busy while at the same time doing nothing. We watched her shuffle a pen back and forth between her hands as she pretended to ring up checks for a 10 minutes if not longer. Only taking breaks to look over her shoulder to make sure her act was working. 
We ordered the same three things we always order cesar, wings, and meatball pizza. The salad came out with no plates. Pitch perfect was asked if we could get some plates she vanished and never returned. We asked two more people before getting plates. Half of the salad didn't have dressing. The wings came out and once again no plates. We gave up on getting plates and settled for some more napkins and a refill. The wings too were half unsauced. I don't me not that much sauce I mean dry as in fried chicken. The empty tables we were not allowed to sit at remained unfilled with the mythical large group still yet to appear. The two topper in the corner was given to a group of two because they obviously were more special than my party of two since they showed up five minutes later. 
The pizza which should have been the saving grace of the night came out. The first slice I tore into was a little undercooked. The normal light fluffy dough was not as light and fluffy this time. I don't know if that is because the pizza didn't get a chance to fully cook or what. All in all the three items we have been getting for the last two years NONE of them were up to the quality standards pre move. The bill finally came after the bartender and a dishwasher exchanged numbers with the blonde at the end of the bar. The bill for the 3 items we always order was yes you guess it more expensive than pre move. Overall our first experience at the new location was lacking and made us long for the days of the old location. As we drove away a night at our previous pizza place had us questioning if we would ever return."}
{"text":"Really excellent pizza and a great fun friendly  environment! The wings were delicious too."}
{"text":"This place is a great pizza joint. I've been here several times and never been disappointed. The staff is super friendly and the owner is on top of things. He runs his place the old fashion way where he takes time to talk to the customers and seems to really care if you are enjoying the food. The only problem I have with this place is because I can never choose what I want to eat because I want it all! The baked ziti with the addition of sausage is fantastic. It's super rich and full of flavor. Keep in mind this place is normally very busy so expect a wait at times because everyone else knows the secret of how good this place is."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza.
Friendly people.
Convenient location.

My friends and I finished the ToughMudder out in Eastmark and were jonesin' for some delicious food. We yelped this pizza place and figured, 'why not?!\"
Parking was easy (location points), and we walked right in were greeted by Tony (uh, a name like Tony in an Italian place? Authenticity points), given some free garlic knots for it being our first visit (awesome points), and on top of all that the pizza was SO good. The thinner crust is so delicious, and it was cooked perfectly.

They have salads, appetizers, pizza, pasta, and the service is second to none.
Would I go back? Duh.
Would I recommend this place to others? Duh.
Would I dream about them opening locations with super friendly Tonys all over the valley? Every night."}
{"text":"Dang, this place is awesome. They still remember us (by name) If you haven't been here yet, do come.  The food & service is the best I've experienced."}
{"text":"We moved from NY quite a few years ago and this is one of the very few pizzerias that can actually make a NY pizza. The staff is super friendly, even remembering your name from previous visits. The pizza and the wings are delicious. I've also had their hot meatball sub and it's really, really good. The restarting itself is a perfect environment for kicking back and eating a pizza with a pitcher of Coke. Fantastic and a must have if you're in the Gilbert area. They don't deliver, but it's worth the drive to pick it up if you'd prefer to eat at home."}
{"text":"Very friendly and attentive even when they were swamped.  You order at counter and they bring you food to your seat.  Plenty of seating at about 5 pm Saturday night.  It was clean inside. Kids had slices of pepperoni pizza they said it was good not great. I had eggplant Parmesan without pasta, and I loved it. The sauce was tasty to me. We were served complimentary garlic knots which I didn't have, my 17 year old said not enough flavor to those, just blah, but they were free so... They served warm bread which the kids liked. I think it came with my food.  I liked it and would eat there again , kids said they would have to try a whole pie to give it another chance. I did like their sauce though."}
{"text":"A lot of good review for this place so I was really excited to try it. The owner was there who was very welcoming and gave us some free garlic knots for our first vist. The downfall was the food, we had a peperoni pizza and knots which were both very bland in taste, they need to add some flavor to their sauce it was pretty watery and lacked taste. I really wanted to like this place but too bad :("}
{"text":"Used to be better, I ordered a ton of pizza for a family event and it was just ok. I used to love the pizza, but it looks and tastes like it's not the same.: ("}
{"text":"The sauce. Is Good that's about it 
I've had better pizza elsewhere 
They can't handle a busy Friday nite 
Same old story when you try to push out more 
Food than you can handle.  The quality suffers and so do the customers 
A word of advice tony: inspect your food from time to time"}
{"text":"Our new go-to pizza place. And i love how they do pizza by the slice since the new fad is getting a whole 10' pizza to yourself.. i can never eat that much! AMAZING food, GREAT service. Very modern interior with a sleek bar area & private party rooms that are 5 star. Never had a bad experience here and i don't think i ever will! Tony at the front is the best and always working his butt off! Needless to say, if you're on YELP right now and considering coming here... COME HERE! :)"}
{"text":"After my post. A few minutes later they gave us free zeppolis. Omg. This place rocks!"}
{"text":"Being a girl from Boston and having a love for good pizza, we finally checked it out!  Friends of ours who are from the Bronx said that this was the best pizza in town and it's definitely in the top three for our family now!

From the moment we walked in until the moment we left, it truly felt like we were home having pizza with our family.  We had the traditional and the Sicilian crust, BOTH equally amazing!  The sauce and cheese were perfection and the garlic knots were delicious as well!"}
{"text":"Love the food, love the staff. Everything I've tried has been superb: The pizza, Calzones, Sub sandwiches. Love it all. They have a big menu. I still have dozens of things I want to try.5/5 all the way."}
{"text":"These guys are fresh out of Brooklyn, NY.  Pizza is SOOOOOOO good!  It's nice and crispy on bottom and fluffy in the middle :)  HIGH quality toppings too!

We've been NUMEROUS times and again today!"}
{"text":"Tony is the man! And his crew...just as great! Friday night, called at 830 and asked if it was too late to order a large white with wings. His answer? Never too late! Even if the food was bad, which we all KNOW it isn't, the customer service and personal service make it even better! Unfortunately...You can only give 5 STARS on this app. 

Thank you Casanova Brothers!"}
{"text":"Great food and service.  Garlic knots are good.  Calzones are great!  However, the best part was the over the top service. It's not every day that a restaurant gets food AND service right.  Nice work! We will be back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The brothers are so welcoming and friendly, if you go often they will greet you by name. 
The pizza is excellent."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place. Where do I start? I try something different everytime we go and I'm never disappointed.The pizza is the way pizza was always intended to be. The sauce...oh so perfect. Not too sweet, not too salty, or acidic and doesn't overpower the flavor of everything else but complements it just right. The crust handtossed and not too doughy. Nothing is heavy or greasy. Calzones are almost better than pizza,almost but only because pizza is so dang perfect. Alfredo just the right amount of garlic. Eggplant parmigiana was not overcooked like most places, it was almost crispy and smothered in their amazing sauce. And what really makes this place great is the owner and staff. You can really tell everyone's heart is in it to make this place great and it shows. First timers get free garlic knots that are to die for."}
{"text":"I have to start off by saying their service is probably the best I've ever had how it's a better than a five star restaurant and a little hole in the wall pizza place but unfortunately the pizza wasn't that way it was your average New York style crust with no flavor so it was okay she is very good though zeppoles Moore OK garlic knots work hold then like the sauce on the side it was too acidic phenomenal service maybe back to try something else"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Casanova Brothers for about 2 years and I can honestly say that I've never had less than an exceptional experience. The owners remember your name, ask about your family, and genuinely care about each customer's experience. The Sicilian pizza is great, thick but never doughy, and crunchy with the perfect amount of cheese. However, the white pizza is what keeps me coming back! You can order by the slice or get the whole pie, and my staple toppings on the white pizza are sausage, onion, and spinach. A must try! Atmosphere is inviting and the staff are excellent. If you are a pizza snob, you will find no better pizza around!"}
{"text":"One of the last places with personal service from the owners.  Its rare that you see the actual owners working and cooking !!  These guys are super nice and made my experience feel like they have known me for years.  They are old school for sure.  The food is quality and hand made.  My new favorite lunch / dinner place.  They have lunch specials too.  Two huge slices and a drink for $6-7. Very clean and each table is set to perfection.  These brothers take pride in their business and it shows."}
{"text":"What can I say? The pizza is the perfect New York style and these guys do it right. Also they put the P in Personal Service. That's not something you see much in this area. Most restaurants treat you like a number. Not these \"goodfellas!\" They take their pizza and their customers seriously. They make it a point to welcome you to the restaurant and most of the time they call their customers by name. That is a lost art and you gents have my admiration for pulling that off! There's a lot to be said for tradition and this is the way they did it back in the day and they did it right! My wife and I had our second trip to the place today and had the large pepperoni. It was cheesy and had plenty of fresh cut pepperoni on top. The dough was the traditional NY style that you can fold and eat on the go. The flavors made me think I was back home at Mario's Italian restaurant and really made me long for the good old days! The proprietors made darn sure we were happy with our meal and the service was excellent! Try this when you go: Just TRY and leave without the owners thanking you for coming in. You will NOT make it out without them at least thanking you and possibly shaking your hand. Also the walls are literally covered with autographed photos of all the greats from the entire cast of  \"The Godfather\" to the \"RatPack\". The atmosphere was nice and quiet and the A/C works great so you won't be uncomfortablet! If you want true New York style pizza and some of the best service in the valley then look no further than this little place (locally owned and operated by the way!) on Val Vista just south of Baseline. You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place around! This place is so good my 6 year old son said, \"this is my favorite store!\" Meaning he loves the food here. lol This sounds crazy but my mom is Asian and she love this place. This is saying a lot since she doesn't like a lot of Italian food."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! Awesome wings! Great sauce, great taste and best of all.... great customer service! I came in with my fiancé tonight for my first time and will definitely be back. As all the other reviews state, the owners here go out of the way to show their appreciation and make you feel welcomed as if you were family."}
{"text":"Oh the happiness in my mouth when I bite into a slice of Sicilian pizza! The best! This is it, its the real stuff! If you like a great thick crust pizza pie this is the place to go. When my honey is in dog house all he has to do is go pick one of these bad boys up and its all good !

As a kid a worked for a NJ pizzarea and we made this type of crusty pizza oh what a process! This is almost too much work you gotta be good  to get such flavor! So ,once I asked Tony how made his crust and bingo bango same as we did !  Comes in small n large takes awhile so try calling in and picking up. (We live in NW Mesa) its worth a try enjoy"}
{"text":"Very friendly, great service, fairly authentic New York style pies.  Fantastic ingredient list with lots of other options (meatballs, canzone, pasta, etc.).  Skip the thin crust,  their original is almost as thin and better.  Didn't try the Sicilian style deep dish.  Could use more garlic in the sauce but that's a personal preference. 

Constant flow of sit down and take out so you know everything is fresh but call ahead if possible so you don't have to wait."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza joints in the East Valley. I've lived here for 2 years (Val Vista Lakes) and never knew they were here. The owners talk to you like you're family (seriously, first names, and they know you after your first visit). They'll even sell you a dough ball or two if your wife wants to go Rachel Ray and try something that won't work (sorry honey, you know it's true)"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner at Cassanova Brothers, WOW the pizza was awesome, New York style, and the service was exceptional, thank you Tony and Mike, we will be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I recently moved to Gilbert, and tried this place on a whim because we drive past it constantly. The service was amazing, each time we've been every employee from the hostess to the servers were very friendly and welcoming. The owner actually remembered our names from the first to second visit, even though we only had a brief conversation during the first visit. Their fettuccine Alfredo is my new favorite, and the garlic knots are great too! We highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I love Casanova Brothers Pizza! I went for the first time this last week and i was truely impressed! I live right in that area and i am embarrassed i did not know about Casanova Brothers before! This Might be my new favirote pizza place in Gilbert! The Food was amazing and the price was more then reasonable! I went for lunch and they had a few specials that you can choose from for a cheap price! The Pizza is NYC style and it feels like you are in New York when you eat there! I would recomand this place to anyone that enjoys pizza or just food in general!"}
{"text":"Great pizza. Love the new location. Suggestion: more craft beer on tap would be great!!!"}
{"text":"Literally one of the best pizza places I've been to. Everyone there is friendly and they really treat you like family. Their sauce is homemade, it tastes like they put garlic in their dough, and their desserts are delicious and addiction! Every time I've been there they give me an order of garlic knots, which are amazing, but also really considerate and friendly. There is absolutely nothing negative about this place, even their prices are reasonable! I love this pizza restaurant, I will definitely recommend to friends, and I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Great food & excellent service! First time here and everyone was so nice and attentive. Tony was awesome! He really welcomed us and made us feel comfortable. Pizza was delicious as well as the garlic notts! Great specials also, definitely coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Complimentary garlic knots! I would just leave you with those three beautiful words, but I believe those are only for first timers. They really have something here with this little piece of New York. Excellent customer service. Excellent Italian food. Tony and his staff went above and beyond. We will be back!

Support local business."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've ever had.
TONY, MIKEY and his family are the greatest.
My aunt came to town and I wanted her to try it.
She said the same thing.
Seriously these people rule the pizza world.
Never tried their other menu items but I'm sure there just as awesome.
Every dollar you put into the pizza you get quadruple in return.
Quality, Quality Quality.
And you can't beat their old school friendly style service.
You feel like you have known them your whole life.
I wish more businesses were like them."}
{"text":"We are new to the area & pizza is one of our favorite foods! Not only were we pleased with the taste of the pizza (it's our new favorite) but also the atmosphere & kindness of the staff! They acknowledged we were new, gave us free garlic knots, & thanked us for coming in! It's because of this that we now call Casanova Brothers Pizza our go to place!!"}
{"text":"Our family LOVES the food here. Quick, friendly, delicious, and a great restaurant to take kids to. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Upon entering, we were greeted by the hostess and Tony. Service was great and we were given free garlic knots since it was our first time. We tried the White pizza and NY Special and both were delicious! Tony came to check on us and we like that he attempts to get to know his customer's on a personal level. We were given free zeppolis for dessert but they were tough (I think it might have been because they were warmed up too long). Before we left, we were given garlic knots to go. Because of the excellent service and great food, we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Being from New York I am very pleased with the very tasty pizza. Oh and the garlic knots we're on the house and they we're tasty as well. Customer service was over and beyond we will be back. Oh bye the way the garlic knots we're on the house being a 1st time customer."}
{"text":"This is our new favorite Italian Restaurant!!! Our first visit, we sat in the restaurant section and from the moment we walked through the door until the moment we left, service was phenomenal! The food, amazing! We had garlic knots, wings, Caesar salad, pizza and pasta (we wanted to try it all!) Everything was really good, the honey hot wings and alfredo were our favorite! Our second visit, we sat in the bar - same amazing service! We ordered the same wings, alfredo pasta which came with a salad... so much food and cold beer! :) we will be back, over and over again! :)"}
{"text":"We recently moved to Gilbert and stopped at Casanova Brothers for dinner with our 2 young daughters as it is right by their preschool. We were warmly greeted upon entering the restaurant. One of the staff came over to explain the menu and ask if we had any questions. They also gave us 2 orders of free garlic knots for our girls to keep them happy while we waited for our food to come out. The food is delicious - you can definitely tell that it is homemade and authentic Italian food. My girls really loved their spaghetti and pizza. I had the chicken parmesan sandwich and it was really good. The only thing is that they don't have booster seats (only high chairs) I would recommend getting a few as there are a lot of families who dine there. Highly recommend Casanova Brothers Pizza!"}
{"text":"This is generally a great place. Their pizza is the closest to real NYC pizza I've found. But you must try their calzones!!! So huge and so good. Their pizza would easily get 5+ stars from me (definitely worth giving it a try).

The people behind the cash register are always nice. Tony remembers many people by name, and often walks around and exchanges stories in the best spirit of Italian pizza places in New York.

Why would I give them only 3 stars then, you may ask... Mostly because this place is somewhat inconsistent. We have ordered garlic knots every time we came and they come out differently every single time. Sometimes you get 2 little containers of marinara sauce & sometimes just one. Sometimes your marinara is chunky and delicious and once in a while it's like thin tomato soup. I don't like the taste of water either, but that might be a personal preference but since I don't drink soda or sweetened iced teas, I sometimes feel stuck.

Overall, definitely check it out!!!"}
{"text":"My father, who is from New York is always on the hunt for authentic, flavorful NY style pizza. He took us to Casanova Bros. yesterday. He said we had to try it and it was the best. Sure Dad. Sure it is. Well, father knows best. It was amazing!!!

We walked in and one of the owners looks up at my dad and calls his name. He remembered him! He also remembered my Mom's name too. Ok. That is cool. We go to order. My Dad introduces me and my husband to the owner. He shook our hand and yelled back to his crew and they gave a shout out to us first time customers. That made us feel special. But how was the food? 

We ordered pizza, lasagna, salads and the owner gave us free garlic knots to try. That was really nice. Prices were pretty fair. We sat down. The place was spotless. I had to use the restroom. That was spotless. The indoor temperature was nice and cool. Drinks from the beverage fountain were clean and cool. Even the tea dispenser was spotless.

Soon our food started coming out. The salads were crisp, colorful, cool and full of flavor. The garlic knots were heavenly. Perfectly chewy and light. But with that wonderful garlic flavor, not too heavy on the garlic. I will be coming back for these babies. Wow. And every time someone from the crew came and delivered food to out table they were sincere and friendly. Engaging in polite conversation and really wanting to know if we were all ok.

Then the pizza and lasagna came out. You know when you are dealing with a chef who really takes care in his craft. It was one of the best pizzas I have had in a very long time. The crust was light and chewy and went perfect with the toppings. The sauce was unlike anything I have had before. So balanced. The chef came out and asked us how we liked everything. We had absolutely nothing but praise for this guy. It was amazing.

As we were leaving they all said goodbye and hope we come back soon. Heck yes we will!

So if you want really really awesome food with amazing service, this is a great place to get it!"}
{"text":"I'm with Sandra M. on this one guys. Casanova Brothers is just - aight. I ordered 1 slice of pepperoni and a drink to go. Because I mentioned that it was my first ever visit, they gave me a free order of garlic dough knots. Now that was real cool and unexpected.

When I walked in, the atmosphere was friendly from the staff, though I felt awkward when the 6 or so customers in the restaurant all stopped and turned to see who was coming in. ... I suppose my presence has that effect on people. I mean, I WAS wearing these awesome sunglasses. My fave. Maybe I looked like a celebrity... Imagine the light hitting my face just right, and the draft from the door blowing my hair in just the right direction... Yeah, that was it. I am a celebrity. For a hot second.

All right, all right - the dream is over. Back to the pizza: My slice of pepperoni was good. The crust had a good balance of crisp and soft all the way through, the sauce tasted authentic though forgettable, and the pepperoni looked generic but had the right amount of crisp to it and no floating grease. That's important.

The real downer were the dough knots. Ew. I was looking forward to these. The instructions on the Styrofoam container said something like \"heat for 30 seconds in microwaveable container.\" I did that and ended up with overheated, extra tough dough knots. Boo.

My previous pizza-by-the-slice restaurant nearest me moved or closed or something. It was my favorite. So I was hoping to find an alternative. Jury's still out on that one...

I could easily give my experience 2 stars. BUT, three stars for the free dough knots (even though I threw them away). The gesture was thoughtful enough to warrant a return visit. (Side note: My Coke was delicious from the self-serve fountain. It had the perfect amount of syrup to carbonated water. But I didn't come for the Coke...)"}
{"text":"Feeling so sad and disappointed.  Been so happy eating here until today.  Ordered a pie with sausage, a salad, two orders of garlic knots.  After we place our whole order the girl tells us it's a 45 minute wait for the pizza!!!!!!  Why not let us know in the beginning.  She said they have individual slices available.....I had my hungry husband and kids with me so we settled for the slices which costs us much more than buying the pie.  Felt ripped off.  Also the pizza was not really hot.  Don't know if I'll  be back."}
{"text":"After dropping by today with my son today, I had to review Casanova's again just to tell everyone that this place just gets better and better.  Had the plain cheese pizza which is as good as any New York pizza.  Had spaghetti and meatballs--delish.  Fried zucchini appetizer was great.  And the icing on the cake was that when we walked in the Yankees were losing to the Astros and by the time we left the Yankees had beat up the Astros 6 to 4.  Yay!  Good food and a good game.  Made my day.  And the owner is such a gentleman-- we got free garlic knots and zepole!  Loved everything.  Love the new location.  This is a 5 star operation.  Come by.  You won't be sorry.  Tell them Yvonne sent you!"}
{"text":"I was in town for the weekend and was nearby so I stopped by for a slice of pizza.  Of course they were out of slices so I ordered a whole pizza instead.  
I would definitely come back next time I was in town."}
{"text":"My husband is from New Jersey, so finding a pizza place that lives up to his standards can be challenging. Lucky for us, Casanova Bros fits the bill perfectly! My husband, two kids, and I went on a Saturday night around 6pm and the place was jumping. Lots of people eating in and picking up. You order at the counter and then find your own seating. Every seat was taken when we arrived, but people move in and out pretty quickly. We were lucky enough to get something just as we finished ordering. We ordered a NY Special pizza, garlic knots, and mild wings to share. Everything was fantastic! The crust on the pizza was thin and crisp with just the right amount of sauce and cheese. We all agreed that the wings were fantastic with just enough zing to please both kids and adults. My husband had the Sausage Parmigiana and gave it a resounding thumbs up, too. The food at Casanova's is incredible, but it is the staff that makes this place extra special! They are all very friendly and make the extra effort to provide a great experience for their customers. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It was meh. Very campy. Not at all a New York Style eatery. Garlic knots were small, greasy and tasteless. No delivery?!!! Pizza Bland over priced. Much Better pie at Sal's or Brooklyn V's. I have been looking for a good slice, this is not the place. Hopefully you take these reviews seriously and learn from the feedback. Arizona is not NY, but guys come on."}
{"text":"Delicious Italian food, with owners that go out of their way to make you feel welcome. We loved everything we had."}
{"text":"Best pizza as I've ever had.  The owners Tony and Michael were great!  Alex our server was also amazing!  It's a very tightly knit family business and I can't say enough about the place!"}
{"text":"The closest thing to a NY slice in AZ, and the bake ziti was amazing. Staff was very friendly. If they delivered i would likely order 3x a week."}
{"text":"I've been searching for ravioli that would at least somewhat remind me of Italy for months now. Everywhere I go, everyone flavors their Italian food with so much salt. Not Casanova's! The cheese ravioli was sooooo delicious! My husband got chicken fettuccine alfredo, which he loved. We both had leftovers since it comes with salad (big and filling with good dressing and croutons). 

We were stuffed, but since we had read so many reviews about the pizza we got a slice to go. It was good too. I love Venezia's pizza, and I'd say don't expect the same softness as their dough. 

The dough on pizza isn't overly flavorful, but it's dough-y, which I like, but still thin. And they get a crispness on the bottom that is perfect. I usually don't like thin crust but the dough was soft enough for me to enjoy 
thoroughly and my husband liked the Boar's Head ham.

The best part of Casanova's was the customer service. We were greeted by Tony and he did the most to remember our names. We got free garlic knots since it was our first time (yummy too). It was a bit warm inside, but that was my only complaint. They seemed very busy, which is great for an independent place. 

I've never been to New York, but I can imagine this is the NY hospitality of pizza joints everyone tells me about. 

We'll be coming here again!"}
{"text":"Great customer service! This was my first time and tony himself came to your talk and greeted us  making up feel very welcome and at home"}
{"text":"I had to find a new pizza joint after my old fave changed management and the taste just wasn't the same. I decided to try this place because of the reviews. I'm so glad I did. The pizza is delicious! Crispy chewy crust just the way I like and just enough grease to my liking. The service is top notch and they make you feel like appreciated regulars. Prices are fair and menu is your typical pizza joint offering. Wonderful NY style pizza and is now my go to place for pizza night."}
{"text":"This is by far the best New York Style Pizza in the Phoenix area, the staff is the best. Thank you guys"}
{"text":"Hands down the best service I have had at a restaurant in years...maybe ever. Tony and his crew bust their butts! Salad was fresh, and my little one loved his slice. When they realized the slice was for a toddler, they took it back and sliced it into bite size pieces. I will return."}
{"text":"First time customer. Started off by being greeted by Tony who introduced himself and asked for my name and my son's name, who happened to be incessantly attempting to get my attention, at the cash register. Already, a great first impression in my opinion. I ordered an 18\" pep,  honey bbq wings and garlic knots.  All were very delicious! My son loves the garlic knots. Customer service was excellent and the food was excellent. I will, most definitely, be a return customer. Tony is awesome and the kitchen did an excellent job with the food. I had take out so I didn't have any interaction with the wait staff but I'm sure they're just as awesome as the rest!"}
{"text":"I love Casanova Brothers.  It was one of the first places I began to frequent.  You order at the counter, they bring the food to you, not a terribly large place but I've never had a hard time finding a seat.

The first time i went there I asked the gentleman behind the counter if the meatballs and Italian sausage were made in house or brought in pre-made...  he seemed insulted that i would ask such a question, it was funny how it wasn't even a possibility in his mind that they would bring in pre-made food... that speaks a lot for their entire restaurant.  

The staff are all very friendly as I have frequented even more, they try hard to remember your name and you quickly begin to feel like you belong there as part of their restaurant, coming from  a small town, i like that very much. 

Everything is great, try the white pizza they have its great, often have the itallian sausage sandwich with peppers and onions, or the meatball sub... or sometimes the eggplant parmesan, also very good!"}
{"text":"Just finished dinner.  The canzone was great. Full of cheese and meat.  If you like cheese, this is for you.  We also had the chicken fettuccine alfredo.  Creamy sauce and big chunks of white meat chicken.  Very very good. Highly recommended this place!"}
{"text":"The pizza is excellent and the service is top notch! Tony is friendly and makes you feel welcome like your apart of the family. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best italian food in the phoenix area.

The food is very well made, and you have to try different things to figure out the difference. The staff is very friendly.

It also gives a very good value for the money you pay for food. Definitely the top place to go if you have a strong craving for excellent italian food and you have a lot of appetite.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I went here honestly because I saw a coupon in the mail and I like pizza. But when I went I met one of the owners, Tony. He shook my hand and welcomed me and gave me some garlic knots to try. The coupon really didn't save me much, but it got me in the door and I am glad I did, great food. I want to try one of the the bigger pizzas next time I go."}
{"text":"This is the BEST PIZZA in town...but don't stop there!  Baked ziti...Sausage Parm.....garlic knots all hit the spot.   Also, phenomenal service ...I have sent employees here to show them how my customers should feel.    Get in there!"}
{"text":"Well I got to tell you the pizza here is very good. My favorite is the white pizza with tomato and basil on it with well done crust for a little crisp, the regular pizza is good as well. 
Owners are very friendly and care about their customers which I feel is special these days. This is a great place for lunch and dinner. Giving the baked ziti a shot today. 

I am an Italian from Chicago and LA so I've been around and tasted some of the best pizza's around the nation. I will let yous know how the ziti went.."}
{"text":"Okay, so I have this friend.  He's not particularly interesting or particularly fun or particularly anything really, as generic as people goes.  And yet, I hang out with him all the time.  Why?  Well, convenience.  Also, I don't feel threatened hanging out with him, because a voice in my mind whispers \"Hey, at least you're not THIS guy\".  People tend to tilt their heads some while speaking with him because he can never shave evenly.

In any event, I share some of those feelings for my anonymous friend with Casanova Brothers Pizza.  

While I realize this is not a ringing endorsement, I do wish to state that there is absolutely nothing bad about Casanova's and in fact there are some superlative qualities about it.  Walking in is extremely welcoming experience, with some kitschy but charming decor, with signed movie posters and various homage to New York a-plenty.  Wooden tables and intimate booths surrounded by dark red and black tones were quite comforting.

This is an order-at-the-counter place, but was the most charming part of my experience.  The owner Tony bellows out \"Hi!  Thanks for coming in!\"  And either is this your 1st time\" or \"I knew you'd come back!\" or most amusingly, \"I thought I told you to only come back with your beautiful lady with you ya ugly mug!\"  If it's your 1st time here, you do get free garlic knots with your order, which is a nice touch.

A busy Friday night didn't result in poor service either, as the garlic knots were brought to our table promptly.  Nicely and simply flavored, with a buttery finish, but rather too chewy for my tastes, although my g/f liked it plenty.  Figuring we got a bad batch, I ordered another set with cheese melted on top ($4.50), which was a little crispier but still nothing remarkable.  The marinara sauce it came with was perfect however, not too sweet yet tangy and savory all at once.  We also had an order for fried zucchini ($6.99), which was fine on the inside, but way too much batter, although once again the g/f liked it.

Mildly disappointed by our appetizers, I was looking forward to our 16\" white pizza (16.99 + 2.5 per topping), which they offer sicilian style square and think, although we opted for round and thin.  The base of simple ricotta, garlic butter, and mozzarella was immensely satisfying, with just the right ratio of cheeses.  I also added fresh basil, chicken on half of the pizza (just 4 more days of vegetarian torture), and spinach.  The toppings interacted with the base wonderfully.  The crust was very average however.  Overall a solid pizza, but once again, nothing spectacular.

With all that said, I can see myself coming back here 2x a month or so.  The personality of the owner is wonderful and there was a general happy buzz throughout dinner on a busy Friday night.  I won't come here for a phenomenal time or life-changing experience, but when I want something pleasant that is consistent, I'll be at Casanova's."}
{"text":"Lovely family owned place .
Great pizza taste .we have to choose the triple cheese pizza was delicious.
Looking forward to try different plate next visit ."}
{"text":"First time and what a experience! First Tony greets you and makes your feel like family. The pizza is great. Definitely will make this my home pizza and pasta place"}
{"text":"My wife and I visited not too long ago for the first time. The first thing as you walk in the door is a hefty Brooklyn greeting from the guys behind the counter. Straight up New York! 

The garlic knots are awesome! And the pizza is, from what my New Yorker wife says, authentic. I just know it was pretty darned good. 

Furthermore, we just enjoyed sitting there listening to the interactions of the staff. They greeted everyone, seemed to know a lot of the patrons as if it were a neighborhood joint (which I guess it is). And they were, as Brian T. put it, \"...fresh out of Brooklyn, NY.\" 

We're going back tonight, as a matter of fact."}
{"text":"Very friendly service. Food is ok. The pizza (Neapolitan pepperoni) was on par with other NY pizza I've had (I lived in NY, BTW). I wouldn't call it extraordinary, but I would definitely eat it again. The hot wings could have been crispier and hotter. They were editable, but I probably wouldn't order them again. Garlic knots were meh (cold and doughy).  If this place were closer to my house, I'm sure I would order the pizza again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go back.  Food-wise, I would probably recommend Venezia's or Barro's over this place."}
{"text":"First time here. Greeted with smiling happy people. Started with the garlic knots and dipping sauce. The Margarita pizza was piping hot , fresh and delicious. Ended with the sweet Zepolis. Friendly staff and a fresh delicious affordable meal. Wish we had one in Scottsdale. Worth the drive though!"}
{"text":"Just called to pick up pizza 2 min before they closed. Spoke to Mike and received the best customer service a man can ask for. Said they'd make me what I wanted just knock on the door when I get there. This one moment just made my family loyal customers of Casanova Brothers Pizza. Btw, amazing good pizza and wings. Wife likes their fried zucchini. Keep up the great work, gents."}
{"text":"Ordered garlic knots and pepperoni pizza for takeout on a Thursday  night. Each step was easy and as expected. Tasty pizza."}
{"text":"Cute spot! I wanted to try this place for a while and was finally in the neighborhood! I'm born and raised from LI New York and am a bit of a pizza snob! The spot reminds me of a pizzeria from back home (love that they have slices available and even have Sicilian slices!) Tony greeted us and made my BF and I feel very welcomed! He treated us to the free garlic knots as we waited for our food to come out uhm hello who does that? Love that and they were tasty to boot! 

We ordered a small spaghetti and meatball along with a large half cheese half pepp pizza! Everything was solid! I will say to me NY pizza crust is a bit thicker but was good! Meatballs were hardy and the sauce with it was good, little sweeter. 

Overall great staff everyone was very friendly and tasty food! Btw prices are very reasonable for the good food! Would recommend if you're in the area! Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"My mom and I found this place on yelp...and my goodness it's like the pizza gods themselves came down with their spirit hands and fed me pure bliss hahahaha...im a ninja turtle when it comes to pizza so this place did not disappoint..we had a caprese pizza with olives and pepperoni added onto it..and the it was so good..perfectly cooked..from the time we walked in we were greeted by who seemed to be the manager he asked us if it was our first time..which led to free garlic knot appetizer which was yummy as well..our server Noah was excellent..even though he was busy he made sure to check on us when he could..thank you again we will definitely come back..ill be craving this from now on ..i just bring my whole family"}
{"text":"We have been going back to Casanova Bros. for years now. Cheese pizza and calzones are terrific. Service is some of the best in the Valley. My only regret is we keep getting the same thing because we enjoy it so much... we must sample some of the other menu items. Yes, there are two, maybe three other pizza places that are good in Gilbert. They are all different though. Easy, convenient access, and fast service here. Good family restaurant. They do not have alcohol and that doesn't seem to be hurting business."}
{"text":"Tried this pizza place this evening and was so happy we did!! The pizza, wings, zucchini, and garlic knots were all AMAZING!! Everything was absolutely delicious! I was also so impressed by the customer service. Our food was ready on time, since it was out first visit we were given an additional order or garlic knots, and everyone was so friendly it felt like we walked into a family dinner. We will definitely be returning and going the extra few miles for their pizza every time!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. The fettuccini alfredo with chicken is so good. The pizza is great. The staff is very welcoming and professional. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"This place is really incredible. From the time you walk in until the time you leave, you can count on a great experience. The owner greets you and remembers your name. He makes sure everything in his restaurant is always in order and the food has to be perfect or he won't let it be brought out. I had two different pizza's and they were both some of the best pies I have ever had. If you are in town, Casanova is a hands down must stop!"}
{"text":"A little bit of New York right here in Gilbert, AZ. Sure the food is delicious but the best part of Casanova Brothers is the Casanova Brothers, Mike & Tony, They make you feel right at home."}
{"text":"Just got two pies from these guys. A Hawaiian and a Deluxe. Delish. The crust was crispy, a cross between a thin and thick  . The toppings were tasty and plentiful. Best of all it was flavorful but not salty."}
{"text":"We have been coming to Casanova Brothers for years but since they moved into building the customer service has gone down the tubes, horrible, we won't be back and Gilbert Pizza will be getting all our business!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place. We go almost every weekend. The staff is amazing as well as the food."}
{"text":"My first time here & I was absolutely spoiled!! They gave me garlic knots and delicious Italian doughnuts while I waited for my take out meal. 

Really exceptional warm welcome. Friendly family atmosphere. Tony & his staff are 5 stars. 

Food. Is. Delicious. I got the chicken parm meal. Yum!!

I'll for sure be back & I'm telling my friends that live around here."}
{"text":"Best pizza and atmosphere in Arizona!!  Tony and the team made me feel right at home!!  

Everyone needs to give this place a shot!!"}
{"text":"We ate here based on Yelp reviews and it was more than advertised!  Fantastic pizza and great service. We were treated like family. We were in town on vacation and will definitely go back when we return!  A gem indeed!"}
{"text":"We continue to order from Casanova Brothers and love it just as much each time.

The garlic knots are a MUST every single time.  

The last time we ordered, we got an Italian Combo sub.  Full of capicolla, salami, ham and provolone it was sublime!  i ordered it with everything (lettuce, tomato,etc) and that made it all the better.  They even throw black olives on there.  My mouth is watering right now thinking about it.

They use Boar's Head meats and you can definitely tell from the quality of the sandwich.

Run, don't walk, to Casanova Brothers!"}
{"text":"In order of appearance: 

Tony meet us at the door, checked for new people (recognizing the few who had been there before) and gave the 10 of us a warm welcome.

Nicole took our first order of appetizers.  No table service here you order, take a number, and they bring your food to the table fresh from the oven.  When I came back later to order pizza Nicole greeted me by name and we had a super nice two minute conversation.

Garlic knots followed us to the table like magic.  The dough here is great, so these dangerous because they are hard not to fill up on.

Fried zucchini and mozzarella sticks.  We were hungry so these did not last long.  They were both pretty good.

Hot wings and French fries.  If not a coinsure I am certainly a consumer of chicken wings. The wings were better than average, not great.  I liked them and will order them again.  Again the fries were good, but not great.  

All in all for the price and how fast they get to the table the appetizers and super friendly staff would get four stars.  The real \"star\" of Casanova is the pizza. 

Cheese pizza and the NY special pizza.  First rate NY style pie.  Thin crispy crust, quality toppings and old school sauce.   

Definitely on my list of favorite pizza joints!"}
{"text":"My wife picked up our pizza from here. She said that everyone was very friendly, and that they gave her garlic knots because it was her first time there. The knots and pizza were really good. I enjoyed them both. I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"This Casanova Brothers review will be in the same vein as some of the other 3 star reviews. The customer service was so good that it makes me wish I could rave about the pizza.

It's your typical NY-style pizza with big, soft, foldable slices. We picked up a margherita pizza on a busy Saturday night. The owner, Tony, introduced himself and shook our hands while we waited in line. He made us feel very welcome as did the rest of the staff.

I got the garlic knots since they were so highly recommened on Yelp, but I should have trusted my first instinct to avoid them. After zapping them in the microwave per the instructions on the container, I found the knots to be chewy and bland. The side of marinara didn't help at all. It was watery and had an unpleasant flavor. I usually love to drown my food in sauce, but the knots actually tasted better without.

The pizza was pretty good. Casanova Brothers uses excellent cheese, no doubt about that. There was lots of garlic on the margherita, just how we like it, but it was definitely the minced stuff from a jar and not \"fresh garlic\" as promised on the menu. There was very little flavor from the basil because it got baked to a crisp. It would have been better if they put it on after it came out of the oven.

The pizza cost just as much as a pie at Grimaldi's so I think we'll be sticking with them instead of Casanova Brothers. It's a shame because I would rather patronize a local place, but I have to follow my stomach."}
{"text":"As newcomers to the area, we are on a mission to find \"our\" spots for everything - and with Casanova Bros. Pizza, we've found OUR pizza place. We were searching for New York Style pizza and this is perfect with a great amount of cheese, and THE FRIENDLIEST service to boot. The garlic knots were more like \"garlic bites\" - very tiny, but pretty good, and when we went for the first time they gave us a free basket and told us to please sit down while we decided what we wanted. Oh, and free sides of ranch - always a nice touch for me. 

They're also on the way home from work for both me and my fiance which will make for perfect carry-out nights. Gold stars all the way, Casanova Brothers!"}
{"text":"This is a great place. From the moment we walked in the staff was friendly and outgoing. Introduced himself asked our names and even shook our hands!! They gave us some free knots and asked if we had any questions on the menu. They checked on us several times to make sure we didn't need anything and the food was good!
Food came out quick and was delicious!!!
This place is well worth he drive"}
{"text":"This place has excellent pizza and calzones.  They use great cheese.  The owner is very friendly"}
{"text":"The food, service and atmosphere here is 100% legit! I really like how they treat newcomers and tony comes around the restaurant to personally get to know everyone. The crew is awesome as well. When I came the first time, I brought my aunt and my 2 yr old."}
{"text":"Incredible, friendly service.  My first time here, and Louie went out of his way to come out and introduce himself.  Very powerful act!  The food is great...New York style.  Price is right too!  Perfect for the whole family, we will Be making this one of our favorite spots!"}
{"text":"First time ordering carryout, tony was nice and welcoming. The Pizza quality has tanked. Sauce leaves more to be desired, if this is what NY style pizza is all about, then I'm glad I am from Chicago. 

Crust/dough was very bland. It is foldable like new yorkers like to do. My wife said it was worst pizza she has had. The toppings had no cooked flavor to them and they appeared raw. They were warmed with the pizza but no where close to having any type of slight burnt/cooked flavor to them.

Garlic knots were not great but had more flavor than the pizza. 

The pizza reminded me of the pizzas i made when i was a kid w/tomato paste from the can. 

Tony was nice and all, but try the entrees or thick pizza. STAY AWAY FROM THE THIN NEOPOLITAN PIZZA!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Friendly, family-style restaurant with a great menu, hearty food and good prices. The service is outstanding - we are business owners ourselves and love finding new places where the owners are clearly involved and know the power of making the customer feel happy. Every time we eat there, the door is constantly opening with a steady stream of customers doing pickup orders. Clearly it's a neighborhood favorite, so kudos to the owners for doing it right."}
{"text":"Mike and Tony have treated us right since they opened - our 4 year old had her first pizza here.  Can only comment on the pizza since it is the only dish we have had from here - It is a GOOD New York style pie.  Unlike some other family owned places in the area, they have been very consistent in the quality of their pies and it does not seem to matter who is in the kitchen.  We have since moved away and miss having a neighborhood pizza place around the corner.  This place beats any national chain and is one of the best pizzas in the North Gilbert/Mesa area."}
{"text":"Does not worth the price!!! Also I asked for Caesar salad they brought house salad with caesar dressing!!!"}
{"text":"Great service and awesome food! The only reason I didn't give it a 5 was for the wait time and I can't speak to this being a regular thing so I can't say this is typical.  It is definitely worth a try to experience it yourself.  I will say this was one of my best customer experiences restaurant wise in the last six months."}
{"text":"This was our first time and we had a great experience. One of the owners greeted us when we first came in and could tell we were new customers. He made us feel very welcome. The pizza was fantastic! The only small issue we had was having to wait about ten minutes for a server. A waiter did check on us to see if we had been helped. Since we had not, he stepped in to serve us."}
{"text":"Came in for the first time tonight and ordered some pizza to go.  The young blonde girl who was working the register was very helpful and patient when I told her it was my first time in.  She made some great recommendations and told me it would be a quick sixteen minutes.  I decided to go next door, once I came back I got a very warm welcome from Louie.  This place must get a ton of regulars because he shook my hand and introduced himself (after not recognizing me I imagine) and welcomed me to the neighborhood.  The pizza was delicious, but the service was beyond exceptional, I will absolutely be back!!"}
{"text":"Amazing place to grab a slice! Awesome customer service with a warm and inviting atmosphere. Tony makes time to introduce himself and give wonderful insight on selecting the perfect slice. The garlic knots are delicious and the pizza is fantastic with a true crispy crust. Make sure to grab some cannolis before you go!"}
{"text":"Best pizza we have had in a very long time.  We are visiting AZ for a month and hope to eat there at least 10 more times.  Take it from an Italian, the food was authentic !!"}
{"text":"This place has exactlt what yiu expect in any restaurant establishment; great food, great ambience, and friendly service.  This my favorite pizza place in the Valley and in my overall Top 5 restaurants.  

Everything on the menu is tasty.  Period.
They just moved to a new place and it is BEAUTIFUL!  

The owners make you feel like family which is why their clientele keeps growing.  Love, love, love this place!"}
{"text":"Absolutly love their pizza! The crust, the sauce, and the cheese are all perfect! The service is great as well."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic, my husband says their pizza is better than the pizza we get when we're in Italy (I concur). I love the eggplant parm & the lasagne. The customer service is also great, they were very friendly & helpful in giving suggestions for our first time. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. It's clean and friendly. Food was great. Owner came out and greeted us. 
Since there were 5 kids in our group they brought out extra garlic knots. 
Defiantly will return."}
{"text":"Absolutely the most friendly people in the restaurant business. These guys really love what they do, and it shows once you step foot in the door. The food is excellent as well! Do yourself a favor and get here soon. Outstanding!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with family and friends, the service is excellent and the food is amazing.  Nothing like fast food pizza.  The owner came out and introduced himself and made sure everything was good.  Best pizza I've had in a while.  Try the white sauce and garlic knots."}
{"text":"I write this as I sit here enjoying my pie. This place is without a doubt has the best food around. Take it from a kid from Philly, I know New York pizza and Tony and Mike take NY pizza to a whole new level.

Tony and Mike are extremely personable, always very friendly. Shakes your hand, thanks you for your business, makes recommendations and if you're new here, you may get lucky and get some free food while you wait.

This place deserves far more than 5 stars but Yelp maxes at 5 stars. I love it. Absolutely love it and cannot say more rave things about Casanovas, their employees, Mike and Tony and especially the food.

I'd come here every day if my woman would let me spend the money so for now, three times a week will do :)"}
{"text":"Satisfied Customer!

Full and enjoyed my pizza!

Man upfront was very welcoming. Immediately greeted us as we walked in. 

Appetizer and Dessert was on the house as we were new! 

OUR NEW FAVORITE PIZZA JOINT"}
{"text":"We decided to give this place a try because we've tried pretty much every pizza place around our neighborhood, and I'm glad we did! As soon as pick up my large special combo pizza, the owner (which I didn't know was the owner at the time), asked if it was my first time, and how I found them.. which I find something that many many places never have these days.

An owner running every position possible in the place, workin' it like he's not better than his employees. I had to admire that. I shook my hand and said he'll add some free garlic knots to my order. And he helped me out the door since the pizza and knots were so big. Very good pizza, lots of leftovers and delicious knots.. refreshing business to have around the corner."}
{"text":"Being from NY I have an attitude towards pizza I get ANYWHERE else.  Im not tawking about artisanal pizza, but unadulterated NY pizza, big slices that you fold over and let the oil drip off of type of pizza.  This place has the best NY style pizza in the valley as well as very humble and gracious owners who welcome every single person into their establishment, ask your name, how did you hear about us and here try our food!!!!  Who does that?  My answer to that is EVERYONE should do that but they dont take the time.  Even on a busy Friday or Saturday night you are still welcomed because they care.  When you return they remember you, even if its a couple of weeks later.  They have great lunch specials too, that include: pizza, pasta, sandwiches for a very reasonable price.  Try this place you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Service was great, Tony is wonderful, the pizza is amazing, the wings are pretty much hands down the best and crispiest wings we've ever had!! Staff is great, my boyfriend and I will be back guaranteed!"}
{"text":"Super friendly welcome and service. 
Think crust pizza really good.  
Good lunch specials. 
Will return"}
{"text":"Casanova Bros. is the best pizza in the East Valley, bar none.  In the 10 years I lived there, I never had a better dining experience.  The food was excellent, whether I ordered pizza, pasta, a calzone, it didn't matter - it was awesome every time.  And they truly do treat you like family.  Tony, Mike, and Louie set the tone and make Casanova Bros. a true East Valley treasure.  Give them a try and you'll be a regular here!"}
{"text":"We came in from Oregon for a few days visiting family and friends. We found Casanova Brothers on Yelp and we weren't disappointed. Great service and excellent pizza. We also enjoyed the place itself. Thank you Tony for making our dinner enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Casanova Brother's Pizza is my absolute favorite.  Tony always remembers my hubs name!  He calls you honey and who doesn't love that.  His brother is just as amazing, I cannot remember his name but they always make you feel like you are at a family dinner.  I don't have any family here and find this a huge draw.  The pizza is always amazing, great sauce, thin and tasty crust just the perfect amount of chewy and crispy.  If you visit Casanova Brother's Pizza you with definitely find a new regular stop.  Thanks for making me feel loved and special, I am forever your guest!"}
{"text":"This pizza place is a gem!!! The guys here are so nice and know NY style pizza. We always get the white pizza and garlic knots. The food is always fresh and service can't be beat! I would recommend them to anyone!!"}
{"text":"Casanova Brothers is my new favorite pizza joint! I can't remember the last time I had such a personable service  experience. We were greeted by Tony, who asked us our first names and actually remembered them and addressed us throughout our dining experience. Since we were first time customers, we received a complimentary order of garlic knots- awesome! The pizza was a classic pepperoni with onion- thin crust. Not only was the sauce delicious but the crisp factor on the pizza crust was perfect. They even had these fun, tasty desert dough knots covered in powdered sugar that we were given to try. It's obvious the Casanova Brothers take much pride in their restaurant and care about their customer's experience. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"What a experience! So my daughter was born last night and I was rushing around trying to find somewhere to eat for my whole family, I turned to the Yelp app on my phone and luckily found Casanova Brothers Pizza, I told the owner Tony I was ordering for my family because they were all at the hospital to visit my daughter. They had just closed a few minutes before and he said no worries come on in.

He asked about my daughter like he was an old family friend. Being Italian and my dad being born in raised in the Bronx, this place hit home, not only in that old school feel of how they treat you but the Pizza ( I have eaten at over 20-30 Pizza Places from Queens, Bronx, NY, NJ, Chicago) was hands down the best Pizza I have ever had. 

I ordered a Large Sicilian style pizza cheese and peperoni. 

The garlic knots where amazing!

He even threw in a few of the Zeppolis for us to try, wow!

When I arrived, they all proudly shook my hand and congratulated me on the arrival of my new daughter. We talked about places my dad used to hang out and it was just like being home again.

I truly wish everyone can experience the memories that I have growing up as a California Kid who would visit the Bronx and all my east coast family. The true Italian tradition of how you treat people and make them feel at home by feeding them and inviting them in like your family, is the way that Tony and his crew made me feel. 

After this experience I am going to be a local customer for many years to come! I would encourage all of you to find out what it feels and tastes like to be one of the family over at Casanova Brothers Pizza!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best NY style pizza places in town. You're greeted immediately by the owner who offers you complimentary garlic knots. The pizza is the main attraction but the also do calzones and other italian foods. We ordered a meatball/ricotta cheese pizza which was my favorite. I liked how it wasnt that sloppy looking with not alot of grease. The crust was thin and lightly crispy but still easy to fold. The owner himself walks around and makes sure everyone is enjoying their food, we felt like we were a guest in someone's home. For dessert, the owner brought by some fresh and hot doughnuts topped with powdered sugar/honey. Everytime I've been back its the same awesome service, so you know its not just for first-timers."}
{"text":"This place used to be great and their product is still top notch but their service and prices leave a bit to be desired. $22 for a large cheese white pizza is just too much. Their service declined considerably with the new location. It's still one of the better pies in AZ but it will cost you more than what you will pay elsewhere. Eggplant parmigiana sandwich is great."}
{"text":"Best Authentic Italian food in the city!!!
My boyfriend is a fine dinning cook & Italian through and through.I am a huge Alfredo snob and prefer Italian to most food choices. This place has seen our business 4 times in 2 weeks!  
       Tony one of the main managers made a point to learn both our names, sit down with us the first time and has since offered us free garlic knots and free desert just for coming in and being good patrons. 
The baked Ziti is put of this world delicious especially with the italian sausage chopped up in it. I adore the real Alfredo sauce they use & the best meat ravioli I have ever tasted! 
       Our second visit was beyond amazing though, the place was packed early on a saturday night and people kept pouring in and calling in. We still got sat quickly, still received fresh hot dishes and Tony was on the floor double checking tables filling drinks and making sure people were happy. You simply dont see managers go out of there way like they do here. I plan on sending this place lots of business!!!!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite pizza place. Tony is always so personable, remembers your name and always asks how the meal was. The pizza is ALWAYS delicious and the service is great. We wish they were open later on Sunday but that's ok!"}
{"text":"I went there with my wife and got a order of the garlic knots and a white pizza with just cheese. The garlic knots were okay. The white pizza all I can say is holy cow. I was only able to eat three pieces. I wasn't full, the pizza was really rich. It took me a few days before I could even consider eating any sort of cheese again. The service was great. I will be no doubt be going here again"}
{"text":"If you love NY pizza....this is your place!  Tony, Mike and Luigi treat  you like family! They get to know everyone who walks in the door and they DO remember your name!  The  pizza is awesome and the wings are amazing! If you are in the east valley, you HAVE to come here for pizza! You will feel just like you are at home!"}
{"text":"The service here is completely on point, and if you want family friendly this is the place. That aside, the food is just okay, nothing to write home about. Fried zucchini, it was under seasoned but it was obvious the zucchini themselves were fresh so that was a plus. Baked Ziti, really heavy, too much ricotta and not enough sauce. All in all, I'd call it good for pick up or a lunch grab when you want a slice of pie, but this isn't going to replace your favorite Italian kitchen by any means."}
{"text":"Great family operated establishment. They treat customers with a special kind of pizzaz that gives Cas. a unique feeling of inclusion. The food is very tasty as well!"}
{"text":"Bad food, bad service. 
The chicken Parmesan was way overcooked. The food had no flavor."}
{"text":"Sorry, you advertise fresh mozzarella you better be using fresh mozzarella.  Nuff said"}
{"text":"GREAT PLACE! Bomb garlic knots! Great pizza! And fantastic service by my server, \"Sara\"! Definitely coming back soon!!!!!"}
{"text":"Take it from a true New Yorker: this pizza is legit. I've struggled to find places worthy of the NY label in the Valley, but Casanova Bros. scores high for its authenticity. 

The owner, Tony, is as affable as they come; he's as authentically as NY as the pizza (if not more). Since it was our first visit, Tony provided free garlic knots for the table. He was overly generous as well when he provided free desserts. 

The one knock on the place is price. Two slices and a fountain drink check in at around 7$. Not eye gouging, but certainly no bargain. 

Regardless, if you have guests from NY or you want to sample some true pizza from the best state on the East Coast, make Casanova Bros. your next lunch visit."}
{"text":"Pizza was OK, nothing spectacular. I will say it seemed a bit high priced. I might try it again to see if my experience was a one off but nothing really stood out. Maybe things will change once they get into their new location."}
{"text":"Wow! Customer service is amazing! I see why they are so highly rated! I will be back thanks again tony. I had a take out."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place by far. Friendly staff, entertaining atmosphere, and overall awesome food. Worth every minute and penny you spend."}
{"text":"Great pizza but more importantly awesome family environment.  Every time I have ate here it has the feeling of family and that's not and easy accomplishment these days."}
{"text":"The friendliness of the owner warrants this place 4 stars, but otherwise the food does not. Food alone would be 2-3 stars. Pizza is really average at best, garlic knots are decent, and wings are best thing I've tried there."}
{"text":"Best pizza shop in Arizona by far if you want a taste of New York this is the only spot to go to you will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"With higher quality pizza ingredients and fresher garlic knots, this place would earn five stars.  Everything is delicious and the brothers do a wonderful job of making it feel like a family establishment.  I personally don't care for chatting while waiting for my pickup order, but it is a pain that must be endured to receive the delicious products."}
{"text":"Amazing place. Love the family feel. Tony makes an effort to learn your name and gives great information about the menu. He's truly involved and it shows. Had the wings, and the family had the baked ziti and fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp. Everyone was happy and finished off with NY cheesecake. Awesome time. Awesome meal. We will be back. Love this place and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Before I start off - I have been coming to Casanova Bros. for years, The food is incredible and the atmosphere was....amazing. The reason for the four stars is because of the food and prior experiences here.

Fast forward to the new place.... I went on Feb. 3rd and was so disappointed. Maybe my expectation was too high? But...no more order at the counter and sit...which is one of the reasons I loved this place...true pizza place... anyway not a huge deal, but I am not a fan of the wait on someone else to get your things for you. With that said, I'm going to give them a couple of months to get used to it. I was there for an hour and a half...sitting the entire duration ..waiting...Whether it be on a waitress/waiter, food or eating.

When we first walked in, we were asked if we wanted to sit in the lounge, patio or dining area. We asked for the lounge area which is just a fancy name for the bar. We were seated at a table and asked if we could sit at a booth. The young lady who seated us said she would get someone to clean off a booth. Someone came and cleaned off two booths, but no one ever came back and told us we could moved back over...10 minutes later we moved on our own (mind you, no one had been over to take our orders-even drinks). About 10 minutes later someone came over and asked if we had been helped yet \"Nope\"..she took our drink orders and left. A short while, another waitress came up to us and asked if we had been helped yet... lack of communication between the employees. After that, our waitress returned with our drinks and took our order. All we ordered was a 14\" cheese pizza. No appetizers. No other entrees. Just a plain pizza. 30 minutes later we were still waiting for our pizza, and mind you, not once visit from our waitress between this waiting. We noticed other people had not gotten their food yet either, and Tony was apologizing to everyone about the wait.... However when our pizza finally arrived it was warm...not hot....warm... which means it had been sitting there. After eating we waited another 15 minutes for our check. Hence why the order and sit is so much more convenient.  The food at this place is too good to leave behind forever, however I will be placing my order to go, and only hope that it is ready when they quote me a time. 

Obviously, they have some kinks to work out being in a new place... I can't change the order and sit conversion to waiters/waitresses (which I think the east coast feel was lost), but I can wait it out until everyone is up to speed. If this were my first time, rating would be a 2...however like I said...the food is AMAZING.... so just order to go for a few more months."}
{"text":"This was my husband Keith and I's 3rd time to Casanova Bros. every time we have been met by friendly people behind the register. They want to know your name so they can treat you like family. The food has been excellent each time we've come here. My husband forgot to order a dozen garlic knots and went up to order them and Louis (sp?) said \"I'll take care of ya\". He brought them to the table and my husband offered to pay but he wouldn't take it. This is Customer Service +++. In addition, multiple times throughout our visit another employee mentioned how supportive their customers are and thanked those of us in the restaurant.

This place is one of those places that has great food AND great service! Every time we come to The Phoenix area we HAVE to stop in Gilbert and eat here!"}
{"text":"My first time here and definitely not my last! Great tasting pizza! Tony is awesome, I felt like family the second I walked in. He asked how I heard about them and remembered the customer I said had recommended I come here (she moved away over a year ago and he still remembers his customers)."}
{"text":"Love this place, very personable staff! Pizza not so bad either! I appreciate Tony going out of his way to get to know people, and he actually ran out to my truck when we left to make sure we had a good experience (that's how we do things back east folks). Will be back, and do recommend!"}
{"text":"Admittedly, I've been to the Cassanova Brothers on many occasions through the years and they have never disappointed. Yesterday, in the late afternoon, I stopped in with my clients from upstate New York while they were here shopping for a new home. Garlic Knots, Baked Ziti, Cheese Ravioli and White Pizza were on the shopping list for this group. Appetizers arrived promptly, service was given with the signature Cassanova Brothers charm and the entrees were greeted with rave reviews. If you have been here the food is always awesome, but that is not the advantage to a small business owner. Upon our arrival, we were greeted by Tony with a handshake and a smile, he stopped by mid-meal to make sure things were as we expected. Paid the tab, tipped the waitress and headed to the car and thought we had missed out, but that's not how things work for the Cassanova Brothers. Tony pops out the front door to catch us on the way to the car with a big \"Thank You\" for coming in. Such impressive levels of customer service are almost non-existent these days and I appreciate the Cassanova Brothers for making their restaurant a big home field advantage. We will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Great people, great food, great service, and a taste from home.  Quietly as it's kept, their Peppers and Eggs sandwich is unreal.  A street classic that is not seen often outside of the northeast.  If you give them a shot, you won't be disappointed....it's worth the visit and/or pick-up and then some."}
{"text":"Great pizza and friendly service.  The pizza was very New York.  Good flavor and fresh ingredients.   I ordered to go.  They were all very friendly and said thank you as I left.  When I return to phx this will be only list."}
{"text":"I read a review that they had the best wings in Arizona so I had to try it. They were pretty tasty. I went with mild and I should have gone hotter. Decor is New York themed. Overall I give them four stars because I ordered a side of fries and they brought them out with ketchup packets. I was eating in so don't give me ketchup packets. Where is the bottle? Also, I only had one napkin. I ordered wings so I automatically assume I'll need extra napkins. I'll be back to try the pizza."}
{"text":"I've never had an experience quite like Casanova brothers. They welcome you in, ask for your names and a handshake, and generally treat you better than any restaurant I've ever been to. Not only that, but the pizza was the best I've ever eaten, and very reasonably priced too! I cannot say enough good things about this place - I want to bring all my friends and family here!"}
{"text":"Once Twice Three times and STILL great....consistency is key for me and this place serves it up each and every time. BadaBoomBadaBing Pizza here is a wonderful thing!"}
{"text":"Super friendly. Pizza is great. My dad doesn't normally even like pepperoni but he tried it and had two slices... Plus two more sausage. It's like being back in the old neighborhood."}
{"text":"These guys are amazing, I wish I lived closer!!!!  The food is great, the calzones are out of this world (give them time to slow cook one for you, you won't regret it)!!!!! The guys at the front counter amaze me, they introduce themselves to the customers and 99.999% of the time, remember everyone's name!!! Well worth a trip to try out!!!!"}
{"text":"I came here based on the other reviews, and was left underwhelmed. I ordered the calzone, which must have took a half hour to make and I was only one of 3 parties there! It was overstuffed with cheese and very little meat. Sauce was bland. The food wasn't exactly BAD, but it's not something I would look forward to trying again."}
{"text":"The reviews are true the food here is amazing then the garlic knots oh they are to die for my only complaint is I live so far from here lol"}
{"text":"Family business that I've eaten at for the five years.  Just good people behind the counter and great food."}
{"text":"Far too expensive for what you get. We weren't impressed. The free garlic knots for first timers was nice but the food was honestly nothing special. Food was 3 stars, price brought it down to a 2 overall."}
{"text":"Very friendly. They shake you hand welcome you and remember your name. Even brought us samples and the food was great also."}
{"text":"I've only been to New York City once and as such have only sampled the true New York pizzeria experience just one time.  That said, the experience was so unremarkable that I can't even remember the name of the pizzeria.  The Phoenix area certainly has its fair share of those who try to mimic the style and ambiance of old school New York pizzerias (albeit without as much of the stereotypical New York arrogance), and most put forward a respectable product.  But it was nevertheless curious to me that a New York pizzeria (in Gilbert of all places) was garnering such enormous acclaim from Yelpers in an area of town where few restaurants garner a rating of 4.5 or better after more than 500 Yelp reviews.  On a Saturday at lunchtime, I ventured east toward casa Casanova.

Mike and Tony Casanova are the New York City transplants who brought this unlikely local legend to life in 2008.  Walking in at lunch, Mike himself was the first to greet me as I came in the door.  As you walk in, you have two options.  On your right you can get take out, and on your left you can dine in.  The interior wall is mostly brick, evoking the look of many of New York's oldest and best pizzerias.  Autographed photos of celebrities (both local and international) and New York sports team logos also cover the walls.  I was dining in and after Mike got me to admit it was my first visit here, he immediately threw in an appetizer on the house.  That appetizer would be a half dozen of Casanova's Garlic Knots with marinara sauce.  Each knot is about twice the size of a marble and is covered in garlic, butter and parmesan cheese.  A tasty start to my lunch and a small enough portion where it warmed my taste buds without making me full.

Casanova Brothers' menu is true to the pizzas, but also offers a variety of pastas, salads, and desserts as well.  But while old world Italian neapolitan pizzerias are all about the whole pizzas, to me the true New York pizza experience is all about getting a slice.  And it just so happens that Casanova Brothers offers three types of pizza by the slice.  A standard slice, a white slice, and a Sicilian slice (basically a thick square slice for those curious).  Hungry and wanting to get the full range of New York slice flavors, I opted for one of each.  I got the Sicilian with pepperoni and sausage, but got the other two plain.  Also got a glass of Sam Adams Oktoberfest to wash it down.  In just over 5 minutes, three humongous slices of pie were placed right in front of me.

For the record I believe each of these slices come from the largest sized pizzas they offer.  For most people one or two slices would be enough.  But if you've read enough of my Yelp reviews, you know I go big and THEN go home.  The standard tomato sauce with cheese slice was pretty decent, though I can't say it had that much of a wow factor to me.  I liked the fresh cut pepperoni and sausage toppings on the Sicilian and the crust had the perfect crunchy texture.  But the superstar slice for me was their white pizza.  No tomato sauce on this one, but lots of mozzarella and big dollops of ricotta cheese.  Absolutely fantastic flavor with a subtle richness that paired perfectly with my cold glass of beer.

Finally, after looking over dessert I figured what could be more New York than a slice of New York cheesecake.  In this case, its drizzled with chocolate sauce and powdered sugar.  A solid finishing salvo for lunch.  Total cost for the beer, food, tax and tip came to about $25.  Between the Casanova brothers themselves, the food, and the aesthetics, New Yorkers will unquestionably feel right at home here.  I'm personally more into some of the old world traditions brought forth by pizzerias such as Pomo, Cibo, and La Piazza.  That said, Mike and Tony put out a solid product.  Not only that, but each and every member of Casanova's staff that I spoke to asked my name, shook my hand, and welcomed me in like I was family.  This probably more than any other reason is why Mike and Tony's business is so successful.  I can only hope that my next trip to New York will include such a delightful pizzeria experience."}
{"text":"We eat regularly at Casanova Bros Pizza. (have only done take-out) I think everything I've ever had is the best because I can't figure out what I like more. Each time I have something, it becomes my favorite. They have delicious pizza as well as sandwiches and pasta. The staff have been really nice to us both on the phone as well as in person. Nothing has been made wrong or ever forgotten in our order. It's been just as ordered which I value. I have recommended this place to others and hope they find it just as yummy. It's at the top of our list for places to go in the area for food. I highly recommend it. If it were possible to give it more stars, I would."}
{"text":"Everything about this place rocked. Super friendly staff. The garlic knots were a tasty start to the meal. Order a large 1/2 mushroom/ham red and 1/2 white meatball mushroom thin crust. Pizza was excellent. Crispy, tasty, and full of flavor. I will return as soon as possible."}
{"text":"We went there for the first time today for my five-year-old's birthday. They took care of all the details have the pizza ready when I said would be there for a party of 18 and were very professional and polite. We don't live in the area but if we're ever back in the are, we will definitely go there again. The pizza was delicious and our whole experience was fabulous"}
{"text":"The best pizza I have ever had, if you are anywhere near here you have to stop bye. The owner will make you feel like you're at home.  The only problem I have is they are not located in ILL"}
{"text":"we had a craving for pizza And drove to Casanova Brothers from Apache Junction because of the great reviews.  The man behind the counter greeted us immediately and introduced himself as Tony (an owner) and asked our names.  He then asked if we were first time visitors.   Incredibly friendly. 

My wife got the white pizza and I got the meat calzone.  We also ordered garlic knots.   

He brought the pizza and calzone and put it down saying our names as he did. Great memory.  The calzone was huge and it was only the standard size one, not the large.  Its enough for two normal eaters.  Both items were awesome.  the red sauce is great,  the flavor of the meat calzone is super delicious, any one item was worth the trip by itself. 

I wish it weren't such a long drive because this is a definite return.   AWESOME!!"}
{"text":"Me and husband always love the food here. We got the NY Special on a Sicilian crust and it was amazing. Great crunch on the bottom of the crust and soft bouncy crust for the rest of the pizza. I had the small fettuccine alfredo with chicken one time and it was the perfect portion size for one person without any leftovers. 

The pizza even taste great warmed up in the toaster oven

Our favorite pizza joint in Gilbert!"}
{"text":"ABSOLUTLY AMAZING! We drove by and pizza sounded good so we went in! The pizza is so delicious, the service was unreal, so impressed! Also, the prices are amazing for the amount of food you get!! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I have been a fan of Casanova brothers for 10 years now! Their pizza is NY style, and the BEST! My only displeasure is that they are closed on Sundays, and since moving to the new location, the atmosphere has changed 100%... which lost that hometown personal feeling. But I still love Casanova brothers and highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Casanova Brothers is a great place to go and get great food! The two brothers know what giving great services is all about!"}
{"text":"What a great experience! I was in the area and hopped on Yelp to see where I should grab lunch. I was warmly greeted by Tony who is clearly passionate about his business and his customers. The garlic knots were sooooo good! The pizza was too, but I really scarfed down the knots! They have pizza by the slice and lunch specials. I love supporting businesses that genuinely appreciate their customers and have passion and care for their business. This is exactly that. The owner was continually checking on customers, cleaning, and refilling things. I was very impressed!"}
{"text":"Born and raised in BROOKLYN NY. Used to authentic ITALIAN everything. All our restaurants cooked like this gem in Arizona. Live in MARICOPA ARIZONA SINCE 11/2012. Tried many many very nice restaurants. The oLD saying fits Tony's restaurant. We will feed you LIKE YOUR FAMILY. Or to put it bluntly . If you tried the rest try the best. Great guy great service great food. Fresh high quality food. Squeaky clean restaurant. Best pizza in Arizona if you are into real old fashioned cooking. Meatball parm heroes. As good as it gets old school or new eggplant parm garlic knots, Tony's hospitality. Smells great tastes fantastic. Worth the trip from anywhere in Arizona. Bring your guests and family. If you give anything but 5 stars you don't know nothing about ITALIAN . Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We found this little gem when we asked Siri to tell us about local restaurants while we were visiting Arizona. As we first walked in we were greeted by Tony Casanova!  incredibly friendly owner of the place whi shook all of our hands and asked for our first names. When we told them we were first timers we were greeted like family and served like royalty. This place is top notch and if we lived here we may be here every week highly recommend it! Had the best time and felt truly blessed to have had the experience."}
{"text":"I ate here again tonight and got a slice of pizza this time. Best pizza ever! The crust is cooked to perfection. I could probably eat a whole pie by myself."}
{"text":"Great place to come and eat some good pizza. Service is great!! Tony is awesome . Will definitely continue coming here."}
{"text":"Big thank you Casanova brother's! I was craving a Pizza and meatballs, and cannoil's. You did not disappoint. Everything was as tasty as the first time I tried your food. As my Papa would say, \"delizioso\"!"}
{"text":"New to the area so of course the first thing I had to do was find the perfect pie. I wish I had found this place sooner! Upon walking in my mom & I received a hearty \"hello!\" from one of the owners. While deciding what kind of pie to order, Tony (the man who said \"hello!\" Came over introduced himself, asked our names, & gave us complimentary garlic knots (which were soft, flavorful, & amazing!) for it being our first time there. After we ordered we found a booth to settle into next thing we know our pizza was ready! It was perfection! Super thin, crispy crust. The sauce was the perfect balance of tart & sweet. The perfect amount of cheese (I usually order extra cheese but I didn't this time). Seriously, the best pizza I've ever had (the only thing that would make it perfect is if they had spicy sausage instead of sweet but hey you can't always get what you want, right? ) 

But back to Tony... When he walked around checking on his patrons, he remembered everyones name's who were in the dining room that evening. As more people came in he would say hi to them ... By name! He clearly loves his business & cares about his customers! My new favorite pizza place!!"}
{"text":"Tony and the Cassanova family's great service and nostalgic food were a winning combination.  The baked ziti was great and the ham calzone had ricotta and mozzerela wraped around by crusty soft diamond imprinted dough.  The sicilian which is almost impossible to get right in AZ was the best I have had here.  The white pizza was awesome too.  Forget about it."}
{"text":"It's a great experience. They treat you like family. And the best food you've ever had. I will definitely be here often."}
{"text":"The food is always great you can tell they use better ingredients than the competition it may cost more but its well worth it"}
{"text":"I love that every time I visit they remember me. But beyond that I need to mention that the food is really really really good! The garlic knots are required when you eat there - seriously, you gotta have them. The only thing that kept me from 5 stars is I'm not a huge fan of their pizza sauce. I'd prefer it to be tastier. All else is terrific though. I also think their pricing is a bit high."}
{"text":"Very disappointed ..first the prices are not the same as the ones listed on Google even though a regular customer like to know what I'm paying  ...when I mentioned it.. I was told not our problem its Google's ..huh ok second we called in our order was told it would be 45-50 min ..no worries its Saturday. We arrived in 45 told I still Have time.. Pizza was brought out at 1 hour .. Told its been ready for awhile probably should have checked it there...my bad the pizza look like it was almost 45 minutes old chewy and cold .. Tried to call and ask about it ...sorry we are closed call back tomorrow... I have been a customer before they moved to the new spot service and food was always good...if can't handle growth stay small ...fail lost a regular customer"}
{"text":"We thought it was food but not great pizza. The crust was excellent, thin and crispy. The sauce was too sweet for us and the cheese was blah. Service was good, as was their side salad."}
{"text":"Food was great, but service was not good. Was sitting at the bar instead of a seat. Maybe that's why my order was wrong. They were too busy to check on me so after 5 minutes of trying to wave down the bartender I just ate what was brought. Pizza is pizza, and I will give them that is tasted amazing, it's just not what I ordered. Plus what I had ordered was more expensive of a slice. Anyway, long story short, get a table."}
{"text":"Sicilian white pizza and garlic knots are to die for. They did an awesome job with the new location. It's in the same plaza but is much more spacious. I love the atmosphere. Service is always great, and everyone is very warm and welcoming. You walk through the doors and you're treated/greeted like family. I've had some of the pastas and the mozzarella still as well. All of the menu items I have tried have been phenomenal. This is hands down my favorite place to go for pizza. I rave about it to my coworkers and friends all the time."}
{"text":"Great service and treats you like family. The last time we ordered was on a Sunday at closing. They took the order and stayed open till I picked up the order."}
{"text":"Tony (one of the owners) was absolutely amazing! We were greeted immediately by Tony and asked if it was our first time (it was). He asked how we found out about them (of course I said Yelp), then introduced himself and shook our hands.

I have been in sales almost my entire life, and one of the first lessons of sales is building personal relationships. Tony knew our names, used them often, and knew everyone else's names too! As the owner of a business that's almost 8 years old, this is refreshing, surprising, and welcomed! Now on to the food...

We split a white pizza with spinach and homemade meatballs. It was my first time having a white pizza and I have to say I'm a fan! The crust was deliciously crispy yet incredibly fluffy and soft on the inside. There was just the right amount of garlic butter, and the combination of fresh ricotta and mozzarella was perfect! The spinach combined with the meatballs were the perfect combination to top things off (no pun intended). 

Of course, this wasn't our first meal; upon sitting down Tony quickly brought out a basket of yummy garlic knots, and not to be outdone, he finished our dinner with a couple cannoli's. Perfection!

Tony, you brought us in with your great reviews, hooked us with your delicious pizza (thanks Mike!), and have made regular customers out of us with your incredible hospitality! Thank you guys!"}
{"text":"Tony took care of us from the moment we walked in!  The eggplant was wonderful, the service was great and the portions were terrific!  Had a great experience and would absolutely return!"}
{"text":"Came in here looking for top shelf pizza and we didn't really get anything awesome.  The size of the restaurant makes it a bit cavernous.  Although I loved that the pizza was thin crust, they have it right on the thickness.  Their ingredients did not seem fresh and the salad was meh.  

When you go to a mom and pop pizza joint you can taste the cheese and toppings at a different level.  Really didn't get that at Casanova brothers.  On the back end they send you home with hot donuts, so that's cool."}
{"text":"5 stars for the service, 3 for the food. Ordered a white pizza slice with sausage and spinach. The food was decent, although nothing like New York pizza I've enjoyed in Manhattan. The bread/crust was a little stiff and chewy, but not bad for the price. The service was incredible though. Tony knows many of the customers by name and even learned mine by the time I left. Definitely a family feel atmosphere with hard working and kind employees, if you can even call them that. Fun place to eat."}
{"text":"Went in for the first time recently.  Was introduced to the family,  their wonderful garlic knots and great pizza. Take your pizza business there. Tasty and friendly and prices weren't out of line.  No wonder they have been around for quite some time."}
{"text":"This restaurant had the best garlic knots ever.  The pizza and wings were also fantastic and huge.  The service was absolutely amazing.  Our server Kalaysia was the best ever.  She was incredibly attentive and answered all of our questions.  It was our first time coming here and were treated to a free order of garlic knots.  We will be coming back and definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants great food"}
{"text":"I went for the first time a couple days ago because of the good reviews. It was as good as they say. The owner came out to shake my hand and introduce himself when I picked up my order and that made an impression they care about what they do. Go it's a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST pizza and calzone and marinara sauce I have ever had! In Phoenix for three weeks visiting family and found this gem when the Chicago pizza place was closed. We have been there twice in the past two weeks and will definitely be back at least one more time before I leave next week."}
{"text":"Had a great takeout sausage pizza last night.
Very flavorful and crust was just thick enough, not too thin or thick. Sausage was great tasting ...glad we chose as a change to pepperoni which we usually add.
May ask to have more sauce added next because it had really good flavor and I like a saucy pizza.
Will be back. Also wait time for a Fri night was ok. Some places we have tried in the past were out 2 hours...ridiculous, especially when their pizzas were just so so.
I recommend these Brothers because they turn out a good quality pizza."}
{"text":"I encourage the owner to equip a pair of tweezers, and remove the olive slices from a large pizza. Does the sum of those slices equal 2 olives or more? How about mushroom slices. I would bet that there's no more than one entire mushroom on the entire pizza. It sure must be a great feeling, charging loyal customers $2 for a single mushroom. Razor thin sausage slices, bits of onions and green peppers... all the same. All 5 toppings could be fit into something the size of a golf ball. Lackluster at best. And the reviews suggest that this place is something special. Get real. I went here because some east coasters recommended it. Now, I'm going to make it a point to tell everyone how awful it is. By the way, the sausage is fine grained and doesn't have flavor. The meatballs are like firm Chef Boy R D meatballs, same taste. The sauce is most likely from a can, no care given to it. To any disbelievers, get a pair of tweezers and Prove me otherwise. Everything I said here is true and measurable. Before ordering, just ask to see a slice, and make sure you're happy with what's going on."}
{"text":"I came into Phoenix for a graduation and this place was recommended. As soon as I walked in, the autographed pictures hanging on the wall drew my attention. After being immediately seated, our orders were taken. The waitress was very friendly and patient as we had a large group. We had the caprese salad and margeurita pizza. The kids had spaghetti. The food was amazing!! I definitely recommend this to anyone in the Gilbert area."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me? A strip mall locale in AZ with legitimate NY pizza? Customer service from a verified  New Yorker that far supercedes anything I have seen in a very long time? Believe it! 

Luigi greeted me and apologized for not recalling my name. This was only my second visit and several weeks had passed.   It's impossible not to smile around here with such a warm greeting.
It's difficult to find this kind of service anywhere!. You are treated like family!  Tony (one of the owners) also spent time talking to me about his philosophy around the lost art of customer service.  Other restaurant owners should stop by for a crash course!

The pizza? Incredible! I went with a slice of white with meatball and spinach.  Thin and crisp with just the right chewiness.  You can have your gourmet pizza with absurd toppings and pay significantly more for the experience. I'll take this family run business any time!  All this for around six bucks? Fuggedaboutit!"}
{"text":"Good good- authentic Italian food.  Owners are very gracious and make you feel welcomed.  Plus....they play really good music to enjoy while dining.  Who doesn't like Sinatra while eating macaroni?"}
{"text":"1st timer here and we loved the garlic knots and pizza! Our server Chris was awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"We had forgotten how great this place is! We love how the staff greets you with a smile and the owners always come and check on us during our meal! They ask your name and the next time you visit, they greet you by it!  Amazing customer service. The Pizza is fabulous and the restaurant is very clean!"}
{"text":"Tony gives the Best service I've ever received and on top of that some bomb a** pizza!! So delicious. I had the NY Pizza it was the best!!  Some good crispy hot wings (not too spicy) to go along with it . Everything was good the first time. This past time my friend and I went I had a chicken Caesar salad. I never eat salads not my thing but this one was real good. My friend Jon had a meatball marinara sandwich, of Course I had a bite. The best damn sandwich I've had and the meatballs are home made!!! What else can you ask for!?!?! Try it take my word for it."}
{"text":"Found them on yelp and thought id try it on a whim. From the first phone call to throw in an order i was sold. One of the most welcoming places ive ever been to. Spoke with Tony who was just awesome and very accomediating. Walked in and was immediately greeted with a handshake from Tony. Makes you feel like your the only customer there. Got a half marg half hawaiian pizza with an order of garlic knots, absolutely fantastic. If youre looking for just a slice or for a whole party drop into this place, their specials are great and theyre really quick for carry out. 5 starts for sure for this little local place!"}
{"text":"White pizza with meatballs = YUM.

salads = Meh.

BTW, if you go to their website it states the salads are $13.50, which is untrue."}
{"text":"Best pizza you can find here in the Phoenix area. And the owner is amazing. Comes by and makes sure food is good. Love this place. White pizza is the best!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza and pasta on this side of New York. Not only is the food amazing but the staff is the most friendly group of people in the restaurant business. Tony and Mike always try to remember all of their customers which speaks volumes. I've been coming here for years and thats not going to change. 

Side note: They just moved to a larger location (much needed as they out grew the old one) some people(Amber F.) Have been a bit unfair in their reviews. I have no doubt that they'll work out the small kinks(Not that I noticed any) and thrive in the new place."}
{"text":"The food is outstanding!
Tony, Mike, Louie & the rest of the staff are the best!  My favorite place to eat!

Sincerely,
Boston Mike & Family!"}
{"text":"My wife was not thrilled checking out a new place but we were blown away by the hospitality. They welcomed us, called us by name and gave us a free garlic knot to start. The pizza was delicious and when we were done the owner asked us personally how our visit was. Definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"Finally got to go back a few weeks ago and have a freshly made pizza and eat at the restaurant and I was not disappointed. It was a Friday and the place was packed.  Tony was friendly as usual and remembered me and my son from when we went there before which is nice. The sauce on the pizza is so good. Easily my favorite part of the pizza. Everything about the pizza was great. The pizza itself makes me want to come back but it's the atmosphere and the owners that make it a must to come back.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Hey forgetaboutit!!! Best NYC style pizza in town! Plus very friendly staff and owners ;)"}
{"text":"I can definitely see why this place has such a high rating - GREAT pizza and excellent service. You feel like you are in NY at your neighborhood pizza joint because the owners make you feel so welcomed. This place is legit on their NY style pizza and zeppole. Other menu items are good, but the pizza is by far the main event."}
{"text":"I love this place (so does my husband)! I think my husband found this place on yelp and decided to give it a try. It was so nice to be greeted by the owner and for the rest of the evening we are totally on first name bases. He also gave us free garlic knots for being first timers (at least that is why I think we got them, or because I am pregnant and he felt sorry for me). Great atmosphere and great pizza!  I is definitely the best pizza I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Finally!!!! Real, New York style pizza......and attitude  :) 

Tony greeted us as we walked in, asked us our names, picked up on my Queens, NY, accent and we were pisans right away. 

Pizza was top notch......wings were cooked to perfection and the Garlic knots were hot and fresh.  It's a 2 minute drive from our home so we will be coming back again soon. 

Tony interacts with every customer from the minute you arrive until you say goodbye.  Great food and great service."}
{"text":"We have been going to Casanova Brothers since they opened for obvious reasons and will continue to go.  They are amazing and so is their food.  Their new location is beautiful.  We love everything about Casanova brothers.  They treat you like family.  From the pizza, garlic knots to the pasta and dessert you cannot go wrong.  Delicious !!!  Tony and Mike always remember your name when you come back and that tells me how much they value their customers.  

My husband is Italian and from New Jersey and their food reminds him of the food back home.  That says a lot because he is picky about his Italian food.   When we have friends or family in town we take them there and they live it.  If you haven't tried Casanova brothers you are missing out,

Their new location was much needed as they out grew their old one for obvious reasons.  Amazing food and staff.  I feel that a few people (Amber F.) were unfair in their reviews.  They will work out their blunders (not that we noticed any) and will be very successful in their new location as they were in their old one."}
{"text":"The best NY pizza in the valley!! Being from Brooklyn myself I can testify that this is real not that NYPD pizza processed stuff. Mike and Tony are from the Bronx and like I said this is as close you can get to New York. Trust me!! You will not regret it!!!"}
{"text":"I have heard so many positive things about this place and it has always been ok our list of places to try. We tried Casanova Bros. for the first time on Monday and we are back on Saturday. Mike and Tony make you feel valued and take care of you. We went all out our first time and tried appetizers, salads, pizza, sandwiches and desserts, everything was excellent. We are happy to have a great pizza place so close to our home. Thanks Mike and Tony, we love your place!"}
{"text":"Excellent New York style pizza and HUGE calzones. Service is good, but expect a long wait. Worth it."}
{"text":"Had a business lunch there and the pizza was very good. Both the owners are very frindly and always say hi when you come in!"}
{"text":"This place is brilliant. Pizza is the best. Garlic knots yummy. Mozerella sticks deliscious. Meatball sub divine. Tony makes you feel like family.  Always nice and clean. We love it here. Not much else to say, give it a try."}
{"text":"Best NY style pizza in AZ. Hospitality is 2nd to none."}
{"text":"This place makes you feel like family. Tony brought out our pizza and some garlic knots that were on the house for our first visit and a handshake. Find me another place local that the owner greets their customers with a handshake and I will gladly go. The pizza, there is not enough room to describe it. It is the best in AZ, period. Garlic knots, superb. Prices, way too low for what you get. They are well worth our commute from Queen Creek."}
{"text":"First off, I don't think I could write enough good things about this place.

I'm a huge small business guy, so I will always come to the mom and pop places before a chain. 
First timers tonight, our family of 5 plus G'ma and G'pa, immediately as we walked into the place Tony (I'm guessing the owner) comes out and shakes our hands and sends garlic knots over to the table. 
We ordered pizza, pasta and meatball subs........every thing was excellent a perfect 10!!!!!
G'ma went up and ordered 4 different desserts at the end........and again....perfect. 

He has non stop people coming in through the door on a Friday night, WHY?.....because of how awesome he treats his customers. He recognized every customer that has been in that place before. Shaking hands, hugging the ladies and saying goodbye to every person that walked out the door. 

The only negative I could say is we would of liked beer or wine.....no biggie, we'll live.

Tony you have our business. Casanova will now be our GO-TO spot for family pizza night."}
{"text":"This place not only has great food but they are very welcoming. They make you feel like they really appreciate you as a customer. If you haven't been in before they give you their yummy garlic knots to try on your first visit. Great place!"}
{"text":"From the moment my husband walked in  he was greeted and Tony, the owner came out and greeted my hubby and was so kind, congenial and  jovial. He immediately found out it was our first time and he then offered us free garlic knots. Then he came out, introduced himself and delivered me coffee and the cannolis. The cannolis, garlic knots and zeppolis were DIVINE. The lady who took the order messed up on the half white pizza but Tony caught it and immediately gave us the non white whole pizza and promptly made another white pizza for FREE and apologized so sincerely. The Pizza was AWESOME!!! The Restaurant inside is classy looking without a stuffy air. Great ambiance! Yummy NY style pizza. This displaced Brooklynite is so happy right now! THANK YOU TONY!!!"}
{"text":"From the time we called to place our order this place was fantastic! We spoke to Louie who greeted us to the neighborhood since we were new customers who had recently moved in. He took time to answer any questions, go over the specials and make recommendations. You can tell by how he talks that he is very proud of the establishment and the product they represent. I ordered the special which was $23.99 for an XL one topping, 12 wings and 6 garlic knots. Louie threw in an extra 6 garlic knots as a welcoming gift! I ordered myself a slice of the white pizza and I don't know that my husband had even put his keys down before I inhaled almost half of it. So delicious. Btw the slices are huge! Everything is delicious as I am sitting here with my family eating! Cassanova Bros is definitely our new go to for pizza!"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch.  They have a lot of specials to choose from.  Had the 2 slice special.  Pizza came out nice and hot.  It was cheesy.  Crust was doughy but not too doughy.  And it was crisp but not too hard.  Overall, pretty good slices and I'll be back to try the Sicilian style pizza and the garlic knots."}
{"text":"The customer service is fantastic, beyond expectations and better then any I've ever experienced. The food is Delicious, the pizza is spectacular. Defiantly recommend! Don't forget to try the garlic knots."}
{"text":"Awesome white pie. Awesome. Best Western have had in Phoenix so far. Called ahead on our way back.form Tuscon. The white pie was delicious. Thin crust perfectly cooked. 

Can't say much about the insides except that is looked nice. The day week wee there tit t wss packed with  lots of families and children and list of people.waitjng outside to get in. This place is popular and we now know why. 

Can't wait to come back..and they some of the other toppings. If you love white pie go here asap!"}
{"text":"Visited again.  Amazing flavor, awesome service, very friendly atmosphere.  Definitely recommend and owners ensure everyone is doing great"}
{"text":"This is the best Italian homemade food in the valley. Tony, Mike and Lou will take great care of you and their hospitality is number one. Everything I have eaten here is delicious and a good value. Last night I tried the lasagna and it was excellent. I always look forward to dining at Casanova Brothers. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I am a professional Chef going on 10 years. This is by far one of my favorite places to eat!! If i could give a rating of more than 5 stars I would, there are only a handful of establishments I would give the 5 star to. I have been a long time customer for many years and will continue to be a loyal customer for many years to come. The new location, in the same business park, is a very elegant improvement. While the previous locale had a very casual approach the new spot seems to incorporate more class while not losing any of the charm or family feel. The service has always been top notch and even in a bigger building the staff continues to impress me, they were very diligent in speed and class of service as well as removing any finished dishes before it ever became a nuisance. The menu has also had an upgrade with a few additions, namely a new beer and wine menu and a few quality dishes including the calamari I can not wait to try! Now I do not consider myself to be a food snob but as a chef I have to have a standard of the quality of my food, the Casanova Bros have always held themselves to a high standard and it shows in their food. I have yet to not enjoy a meal here but I would have to recommend their pizzas, philly steak sandwich (which if you enjoy this sandwich you are very picky about it), and of course their signature garlic knots! To each and everyone out there if you had not tried this oasis in the desert I implore you to come to the neighborhood and be treated as a member of the family!"}
{"text":"Went to the new location last night. Very nice. We got the standard Peperoni pizza and garlic bread knots. Very good. Service was great and the beer was cold. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome experience and food!!

We were instantly greeted by Tony when we walked in the door. He got both my husband and i's name and had all the chefs say \"hi\" to us since it was our first time in. 

We were seated and immediately brought garlic knots (which were amazing) and searched through the menu.  There were so many good options but we settled on a pepperoni pizza. However, spaghetti and meatballs were brought to the table next to us, we changed our order. We ended up ordering a small order of spaghetti and meatballs, more garlic knots and a pepperoni pizza. 

We were served the spaghetti and meatballs first and they were amazing. Tony told us the sauce was homemade and it was super tasty! Then our pizza came and it was melt in your mouth delicious! The crust was thin, crunchy and PERFECT!! 

We were so full, so we decided we should order dessert. We got cannoli and zeppolis, which were both finger licking good! 

My husband and I enjoyed the decor and the incredibly nice hospitality. It seems like they have a lot of regulars and Tony knows everyone by name. We also eaves dropped on a story he was telling the people next to us. We thought it would be fun if we could sit down and just listen to the stories he had to tell. You just don't find restraunts like this. We felt like family. We would highly recommend this restraunt to everyone who wants to be treated like family and likes good food."}
{"text":"Awesome place love the friendly welcome ...the pizza is amazing the service is a 10 as well great job guys!!!"}
{"text":"The owner is extremely friendly and welcoming. I really love their pizza there, I only wish that they delivered lol."}
{"text":"I gotta say, i'm a little disappointed.  In myself that is.  I live less than a block away and it took me 5 years before I finally went in for a meal.  I wasted 5 good years missing this little gem of a restaurant sitting right under my nose.  
I love pizza, but I have found offerings in AZ to be lacking.  It's not bad, just not great.  Casanova's on the other hand, brings GREAT pizza by the handful.  My family and I all agree it's the best we've found so far in Phoenix.  
We're from the east coast, so I am a bit partial to the New York style pizza.  I suppose if you like Chicago or other regional types, then this may not be exactly what you're looking for.  But it's incredibly fresh, incredibly tasty pizza. 
Needless to say, I'll be returning a lot more frequently.  One final note.  The service was great.  It's really a neighborhood pizza type of place where the owners seem to really care that their customers have a good experience.  Well done."}
{"text":"OMG!  I drive an hour to get this pizza. I'd drive 2 hours if I had to. 
Most delicious pizza outside of New York. Most authentic New York style pizza I've had outside of New York.  A must for any pizza lover. 
** Friday and Saturday dinner time will be a considerable wait, but we'll worth it."}
{"text":"This was by far my best experience at any restaurant that I've ever had! The owner shook hands make sure we had a great experience and offered free garlic knots and supposedly he's at the end. Every employee really took the time to get to know who we were and what we liked. You don't receive customer service like this hardly ever and it Beyond exceeded expectations and made me feel really special. I want to only go back on a regular basis but I will bring everybody that I know and tell everybody that I know."}
{"text":"This will always be our favorite pizza place here in the valley.  Tony is an awesome manager and always tries to remember the names of his customers.  We love thin crust pizza and their pizza is always very crisp and filling without all the oil that gets dumped on pizza crust that we experience at other pizza places.  If you're new to the place they give you free garlic knots to try and they are definitely worth getting every time you come here.  They're baked Ziti is unlike any other and we come here sometimes just to order as much as we can to take home and eat for a couple days!"}
{"text":"Wow. The experience was as good if not better than the food. The owner brought us free garlic nots and introduced himself to us. Very friendly. I had the baked ziti and it was delicious. I ordered the regular dish and it was almost more than I could finish. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"What a great local neighborhood find!  We were greeted warmly by Tony when we arrived and our server took a lot of time to go over the menu as this was our first visit. They offer a lot of flexibility and we appreciated that we could order a half white/half red pizza.  We ordered the thin crust and it was really good.  We were starving and they were quite busy so we didn't want to wait the bit of extra time for the Sicilian pizza but will definitely be back for one!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and even better service! Tony and the crew were very friendly and welcoming. Would definitely recommend trying the white pizza as it is probably the best I've ever had. 5/5!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and wings.
We were greeted and welcomed like no other place. 
Highly recommend coming here."}
{"text":"This pizza is amazing! Favorite pizza place for sure. Love the white pizza! My favorite is thin,husbands is thick. The guys are super nice & if you go more than 2 times they remember your name! If you want great pizza & friendly people this is the place!"}
{"text":"This has to be the friendliest pizza place around.  The owner knew everyone's name and never forgot.  The pizza was outstanding and we will most definitely be back.  I would give them 100 stars if I could."}
{"text":"I ate pizza here tonight, and it was pretty good. Reminded me of pizza I'd get in Jersey or NY, where I lived before AZ. The crust is thin and chewy, which I like. My daughter really liked cheese pizza and the garlic knots. I'd definitely go back. The 5 star is held by my favorite place for pizza in Bay Area."}
{"text":"I've been to 'Cas (as we call it) so many times that I consider Tony, Mike and Luigi friends. You certainly feel like family every time you walk through the door, especially because Tony makes it a point to ask your name AND remember it. He literally remembers the names of everyone who ever walks in for a slice of pie.

If you're in the mood for a \"meatlovers\" style pizza, go ahead and try the new york special.  It is certainly my favorite.

Also, be sure to mention if it is your first time there. They like to treat newcomers well, and you will usually get some garlic knots on the house.

finally, finish your meal off with some delicious canolis  or zepolis."}
{"text":"These guys know how to make a great pizza. I've only tried the slices and garlic knots because I can't bring myself to order anything else. The owners and employees are great. I only wish they were farther east so I could go more often..."}
{"text":"This place has the best customer service I've ever had in my dinning experience, not only was the service top notch but the pizza , wings, and pasta were on point. All fresh made to order and I will definitely go back. Thank you for the great food and service."}
{"text":"Great pizza and great calzone.   We tried this place tonight and we were so glad we went.  Friendly service by Tony who greeted us like we were old friends. Loved the complimentary garlic knots!  We are Italian and from NY and so we are extremely picky about pizza. This pizza is delicious the mozzarella was quality!  We can't wait to go back. Ps the complimentary Zeppolli and the end of our meal was a nice touch reminded me of our home town. :)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place! They greet you and truely try to get to know you by name. Neopolitan style Margherita Pizza is Bellisimmo!"}
{"text":"I have to say I'm really confused by all of these great reviews. This place was not good. The pizza was mostly crust with almost no sauce. What sauce there was had no taste. It was so bland we couldn't believe it. A lot of people were mentioning the meatball sub so my wife and I tried that too. If those meatballs weren't frozen store bought I would be shocked. They were honestly some of the worst meatballs I've ever had. And again, there was almost no sauce on it and what was on it was bland as could be. We both agreed that we won't be coming here again. If you want actual good pizza, go to Vito's or Spinato's."}
{"text":"I can't say that I've ever been to Chi-town, but I can say that I'vehad a taste of it. I ordered the calzone and it wasn't what i expected, because they have their original spin on an old classic. This monstrous mound of flavor was ready to burst so I sliced it open to reveal the jackpot. Steaming Mozzarella erupted as ricotta flowed onto my plate. This prized piece of \"Paisan\" art was turned into
 abstract art after my first bite. I was so immersed in my experience that I forgot about my manners and the fact that I was on a lunch date!! In a word; \" fuhgedaboudit\"!!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that Tony is the shiz. 
We walked in and he was friendly right off the bat. He asked if it was our first time here and we said yes. He asked for our names and called us by name throughout our whole dining experience. Before we ordered he gave us free garlic knots! They were delicious. 
The pizza was soooo good. The crust was the perfect crispness and was not soggy due to grease. I enjoyed the sauce and the whole pizza in general. 
THEN Tony brought us free fried dough balls... Omg. They were to die for. Hah. So so yummy. 
This is the place you'd bring out of state visitors to show them what Gilbert is all about. 
We will continue to go back because of Tony! And the pizza. And the atmosphere. And the fried dough balls!"}
{"text":"True New York Pizza right here in Gilbert!!!  Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Love the white pizza. We have been going here for years. The guys are super friendly and will let you try the garlic knots on your first trip. Always good food."}
{"text":"Omfg , the chicken parm & sicilian pizza was da bomb .. The owners were as sweet as pie . Felt like I was back in New York . I definitely will be coming back here , it was worth the 20 min drive ..."}
{"text":"Service was awesome and very friendly. They gave us free garlic knots! I liked the ordering set up, being able to choose your toppings and type of sauce. I just thought their pizza was so so... Nothing worth writing about... Maybe I need to try it again, but I don't see myself craving the pizza anytime soon."}
{"text":"Wow!  Such friendly service at Casanova Brothers Pizza!  I was greeted by one of the owners, Tony, and we chatted a bit.  In doing so, I remembered something important: it's the little things that can make or break a business.  As we spoke, Tony called me BY NAME several times.  When was the last time that's happened to you?  Sure, some quick serve restaurants will call out your name when your order is ready, but why don't we expect to be treated like human beings, instead of just a number, anymore?  Thanks, Tony, for being so attentive .... and for the yummy homemade sauce that reminded me of home.  Oh, and remember, Tony ... GO ORANGE!  :D"}
{"text":"A solid NY style slice that is a great weeknight option.  But what really sets this place apart is their customer service. They are so nice and welcoming that you will be wondering how they could possibly be from New York."}
{"text":"Come on Casanova Brothers,,, not that big of an order and 5 out of 6 garlic knots are burned!!!!
I guess I should have checked before I left but I didn't!!!!"}
{"text":"Casanova brothers has some of the best NY style pizza in the Valley. The best Sicilian style pizza! No matter how busy it is, Tony will always greet you as you walk in and most likely remember your name if not a newbie. It's my go-to place for a pie."}
{"text":"Casual family run pizza joint like back east.  Very good pizza.  Owners are very friendly.  Gave some free garlic knots on our first visit.  Recommended and will be going back.  Oh, they sell pizza by the slice too."}
{"text":"I love this place! We ordered the thin deluxe!! Yummy sauce, cheese, pepperoni and sausage, cubed bell pepper, black olives. Reminded me of our pizza place back home in Cali! I met the owner when i picked up the order, he gave us free garlic knots ok the house, amazing!! Cant wait to try other things!!"}
{"text":"the chicken parm came out piping hot and tasty. tons of good food. this is my first visit here and the garlic knots are good. i will definitely be back for lunch and dinner. i have to admit though, tony really makes the joint. there's something nice about a smile and a handshake and a really welcoming personality. great guy."}
{"text":"After the girls finished their basketball training my oldest wanted to eat pizza and wings, since it's her last day before she heads back to Seattle.  Check in to Yelp to find the closes pizza and wings.  Found Casanova pizza and wings in Gilbert.  The owner Tony was so welcoming and very nice.  Excellence service, excellent pizza and wings.  We will for sure be back....Must try!"}
{"text":"One of my customers who is also from NY suggested I check it out. It was my friends birthday so my brother and I treated for his family. I have to say I was not disappointed at all.When we first walked in we were welcomed by the friendliest guy ever I am sure he was the owner (I felt like I was at home) . He asked us if we ever were there before and ended up giving us a free sample of garlic knots. I suggest the garlic knots for sure they were great. Anyways we ended up getting a salad to share and then a large white pie with broccoli and a Sicilian pie all sausage and half mushroom and pepperoni.  The white pie was delicious and the Sicilian pie was wonderful (made fresh so it took a little but well worth the wait). My brother and friend think this was one of the best Sicilian pies they ever had and I have to say it is up there with one of the best for myself. I asked if we could get a dessert for my friend for his birthday and asked to pay for it and he just said don't worry about it we got you and came out with a plate of mini cannolis, one for each of us. I was still happy with these not because they were free but because they were so tasty and made fresh.  

      The owner made sure the hospitality and customer service was always there he came around a number of times, what really impressed me was after being there for quite some time after shaking our hands and getting our names the owner said goodbye to me using my name, it impressed me because there were quite a few people who were in and out of there before we ended up leaving. Do I suggest going there, of course I do it was an amazing experience and they have pride in what they serve you and it shows. Like I said I felt like I was at home or in the Bronx or Brooklyn at one of the pizza shops. I plan to go back quite often and am happy my customer suggested this slice of heaven to us (Pun intended). Make sure you go and see what all the rave reviews are all about."}
{"text":"Tony is the man! You will walk out of Casanova Bros. full, taste buds happy and in a great mood. The owners love their restaurant and it shows, pizza rocks, wings rock and the knots are tasty! We will be back soon."}
{"text":"It's not often you find a family run restaurant where the owner greets all regulars by name and introduces himself to every newcomer. The pizza is absolutely wonderful and the service is incredible! Truly a fantastic find and worth a the drive to visit from any hotel in the area."}
{"text":"Our first visit was great! Excellent service and family friendly.  It satisfied the kids and adults.  Pizza was great and everyone loved the garlic knots."}
{"text":"My business coaching clients need to visit Casanova Brothers to see in real life how to give customer service that will keep your customers coming back.  

Flew from Jacksonville FL and landed in Phoenix a ton of hours later.  Met my son and an old College friend at Casanova's AND the very second I walked in Tony welcomed with a warm heart my friend Aaron my son Jake and myself.  At the same time he acknowledged the people behind us and assured them he would give them his full attention in just a moment.

Instead of ordering a pizza, we had him order one for us.  We ended up with a half white pizza and half pep, sausage and ham that was out of this world.

The pizza is of the highest quality.  They don't serve any beer for whatever reason (missing out on a high profit item).   And the service is the best in the service industry I have seen for a long time.

Very refreshing, friendly place.  You walk in and feel like Norm from Cheers.  Even if the pizza was marginal, I would come back.  Good thing is the pizza is pretty fantastic,"}
{"text":"Delicious food and outstanding service by people who obviously take great care in the making of their product.  

Pros:
-delicious food (we had a pizza and garlic knots)
-nice casual atmosphere
-very attentive service 

Cons:
-none"}
{"text":"Are you kidding, I thought I was sent back to the good old days of the 70's and 80's when dining was a great experience and the staff was happy and willing to do anything to make your dining experience and special event.

WE WERE GREETED BY TONY, ONE OF THE OWNERS AND HE WAS ON A FIRST NAME BUSINESS.  As soon as we sat down we were greeted by the server Dominick, or Dom, what a great staff to have working for this establishment.  Always happy and attending.

Ordered a slice of pizza and split a caesar salad, the wife got pasta and meatballs.  Since were were new to the restaurant they gave us the GARLIC KNOTS, and now we are hooked....nice move!

Unbelievable autographed and table-side manner by the owner Tony, we were interested in a lot of the service pictures and he was more than happy to explain them to us,,,,,very cool.

Oh yeah, the food was excellent and came out in a very quick time,  Nothing but 5 stars here!

Wound never hesitate to come back and bring a real Italiano get their honest opinion....YUM!"}
{"text":"I see my old review referenced eggplant parm with tough skin. I do love the calzone here. But what I hate is old pizza slices. To me it was worse than frozen pizza. I'm mad at my self for not sending it back. I lied to the guy when he asked me when I was leaving sad it was good. I will never go back. Enjoy your Caffeine free diet coke I won't drink that again"}
{"text":"Great family owned restaurant food hhas always been good. Can't beat the White pizza."}
{"text":"i am from New York and have lived from coast to coast during the last 48 years without finding a really good New York pizza. I almost cried when I tasted their pizza because it brought back such great memories. Casanova Bothers Pizza is in the top three reasons why I am so happy to have retired here in Arizona. This restaurant is why \"a 6th star category\" should be possible.
Love you, Tony! You always make me feel like I am dining with family!!! In fact, I am on my way over there right now!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely true to the reviews! We arrived at 8pm and Louie served us. He offered us free garlic knots as a first timer, with a refill as well. Large water cups, and even some desserts to go. Extremely nice and never-before-seen service for my boyfriend and I. We are very familiar with many pizza places across the west and east valley of Phoenix such as Zio's, Grimaldi's, Venezia's, Oreganos, etc and we both agreed this is definitely the best. Their pizza is great, but the service is what sold us. Will definitely come back to try their pasta and other goodies :)"}
{"text":"FABULOSO!  This was wonderful pizza.  When I went for the first time ( I have been many times now) the owner introduced himself and gave me some garlic knots on the house -- DELICIOUS!  The marinara sauce that came with them was amazing as well... something you don't usually find in a smaller pizza place.  Try the sausage pizza  :)"}
{"text":"Came here looking for a good pie. I was not disappointed. Started off with honey hot wings. their wings are damn good. Perfect crispness and the sauce was great. Really enjoyed it. Ordered half a Hawaiian and Delux pizza. Thin New York crust. Most delicious. Great pizza pie. The crust was crisp and not doughy. If your looking for a great pizza joint this is the best in the East Valley by far. 
The service: greeted by Tony. What a great personable individual. Learns your name and checks in on you another 3-4 times to ensure you liked the food. 
love this place. Great little find"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best dining experiences I've ever had. Excellent and friendly service on top of some of the best pizza I've ever tried.

I ordered a slice of white pizza with sausage and spinach, a slice of Sicilian with meatball and mushroom, and a calzone with sausage, cheese, and onions.

Everything turned out amazingly and we got free garlic knots for being first timers. Everyone working here from the owners to the cashier were incredibly friendly. Louie at the front counter greeted us when we walked in, shook our hands and even asked for our names. He also introduced us to the owners when they came in and made sure we were well taken care of whenever he passed by our table. This place definitely beats out every pizza joint I've been to in California. I'll definitely be back if I'm ever around Phoenix again!"}
{"text":"Great food.  Great service.  Free food (newbies) and it was good!  Everyone at the table I was with was impressed by what was served.  Admittedly a group of 5 people with different orders is a challenge but not this time.  Good enough experience that we have already planned on another Saturday lunch as a group together here again.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Beside the pizza being delicious, Tony is so welcoming to everyone that comes in. He makes you feel like your at home. 
The pizza crust is so yummy with a solid crunch."}
{"text":"Awesome place!!!!! Nice surprise 4 Robert. Definitely a flashback 4 him. Enjoyed the way we were greeted when we walked it. Right off the bat were doing introductions n I said my name is Liz n the owner called me Elizabeth. This is definitely a score n we definitely will be back. If ya ask Robert don't believe him if he says I tried to starve him.  
Thanks Tony @ Casanova Bros Pizza we will be back soon"}
{"text":"We had loads of recommendations for this place from friends, and it did not disappoint!! The atmosphere is much nicer than an average fast-food restaurant or pizza joint. Their menu includes the classic Italian dishes, hot and cold subs, desserts, and of course pizza. They've got several styles of pizza, both thin and thick crust and all the popular toppings. We tried ricotta and sausage, always our go-to. I'd rank this right up there at the top of our favorite-pizza-joints list.. Service was exceptionally friendly and efficient. Our pizza was excellent with lots of topping. We had wings as well, also very good. We'd definitely recommend Casanova Brothers and will be bringing our family here when they visit next week!"}
{"text":"I love these guys!

VERY solid pizza and a great atmosphere.  It only took two or three visits before Luigi was welcoming my entire family (myself, my father, my niece, her boyfriend, etc) by name.  

The garlic knots are strong, the sandwiches are good, and the New York style pizza is great.  Terrific!  Just like grabbing a slice in Manhattan."}
{"text":"Very impressed! Amazing customer service along with amazing Eggplant Parmesan !!! We will definitely go back!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome service and food.
Raviolis are great. Also spaghetti with meatballs is great. Haven't had thier pizza yet. But, they look good. The owner remembers everyones name. Some sort of bionic memory or something? Kinda cool.
Its in a strip mall but the inside is roomy comfortable and clean. 
Thier prices are a bit higher then I expected. Paid 35.00 for Large spagetti with meatballs, small ravioli, side salad, 2 drinks and 3 canolis.
But the food we had was very authentic. 
Will look for a coupon for the next time we go."}
{"text":"For the past 20 years, I've been hunting for true NY pizza--a lightly crispy crust, fresh-tasting sauce, and premium cheese--all together in a perfectly balanced harmony. At last! No longer do I reminisce about the good old days of New York, because it's right here in town. I love bringing friends here to taste what is \"real\" NY style pizza.  Thank you, Casanova Bros. My quest is complete."}
{"text":"Our Sunday ritual is pizza for lunch, so we decided to try this place we saw on Yelp. We live 15 miles away, but the reviews made it sound like it was worth the trip.

From the outside it is your classic hole in the wall place, in a main shopping center, with the front windows painted. The front had a mural of New York and the detail was pretty good, something I've never seen before.

We walk inside and it's a little dark, the menu board is clearly outdated with the numbers and letters tacked to a blackboard. There's an employee sitting at the table folding boxes right in the front, I found this kind of odd, couldn't he do it in the back? And as I walked around there's a ton of space in the back of the dining area that he could be folding boxes... He shouldn't have been in the front where the customers walk in the door.

We place our order but the front counter guy tells us to wait a minute while he answers the telephone. He should have taken our order first and put the call on hold as we were the only people in line.

We sat at nice clean booth and a few minutes later our garlic knots arrived. They were nice and hot and they even split them into two baskets for the Mrs. And I. (That way I couldn't steal her extra ones).

About 30 minutes later hot pizza was delivered to our table. It was O.K. It was pretty greasy and the crust reminded me of Peter Piper Pizza. Not the best, not the worst, certainly not worth $25. 

The bathrooms were pretty clean, however the entire place smelled like sanitizer.

I'd probably come back, if I was in the area, and only for a slice and a drink, but we won't be making the 20 minute drive for it.

Not sure why there are so many 5 star reviews, either people don't know there are many other better places for pizza, or maybe the owners have a lot of \"goombas\" on the payroll to make the place look good."}
{"text":"We recently moved to the neighborhood near this pizza place and have heard amazing things.  First time we went in it was amazing!  It was hot and fresh right out of the oven.  Terrific service, they made sure to ask our names and tell us thank you for coming in said our names on the way out too.  That was great.  The second time we went for a late lunch and the same super friendly man was not at the counter.  There were younger workers there and they weren't very friendly.  Our garlic knots tasted microwaved which was very disappointing; however our slices of pizza were hot out of the oven and crispy.  Such good pizza!  All in all this is still my favorite pizza place-it can't be 5 star everytime but they sure come darn close!"}
{"text":"Tried the sicilian slice pizza and it was so good! AWESOME customer service, Tony will definitely remember you and he does his best to greet and thank everyone that comes in... will be back to try more"}
{"text":"Excellent food and the best customer service I have ever experienced. We definitely found our new pizza joint!"}
{"text":"the customer service in the reviews is not exaggerated.  Tony meet us with a smile and remembered my name throughout our time there.  Very polite and respectful.  They seem to genuinely appreciate your business.  The dining room was spotless and very nice. food was delicious.  I will definitely be back for more soon."}
{"text":"Tony introduced himself right away and asked if it was our first time.  We were quickly ushered to a seat with some garlic knots on the house!  Tony then recommended that we do half white and half deluxe pizza!  They were both amazing!  Best NY style pizza I've had in AZ!  Fast, friendly service combined with amazing food!  Can't wait to go back and try some of the pasta and sandwiches.  Only thing missing was a beer, but I didn't miss it enough to rate lower than 5!"}
{"text":"Super friendly owners who get to know you by name.  Calzones are huge and great.  They sell individual slices of pizza.  Love the meatball sub and the sausage sub."}
{"text":"I love there food. From there garlic nots to there pizza and pasta. The energy of this place is amazing the owners greet you by name and are so friendly and personable. Will recommended this place to everyone."}
{"text":"The baked ziti with sausage was delicious.
I love Casanova Brothers.
The owner so nice.
I highly recommend it.
The cheese cake and bread are good too."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Fresh ingredients. Great service. Clean restaurant. Friendly and personable staff. Great experience. Everything one wants in a restaurant and why one goes out to eat."}
{"text":"First time trying pizza from here. Great NY style pizza!  Tony and the staff were great.
I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Good pizza and cool atmosphere, will definitely return when I get the chance!"}
{"text":"These guys are so nice. The pizza is good, and the service is even better. I love to come in with my friends on the weekend. I recommend the pepperoni with mushrooms, or the ham and pineapple, those are my favorites. If you haven't given these guys a try, I would recommend stopping by."}
{"text":"First time here. Week gotta say the service award a little slow, took a while to get our food and hen the order was wrong. once the food arrived it was pretty damn good food tasted fresh."}
{"text":"I must say, the owner/staff are attentive, maybe a bit too much. And the pizza, though fresh with a nice thin crust, is just average. Nothing spectacular. Also ordered the garlic knots. They were hot but lacking garlic."}
{"text":"Great family place! My kids are obsessed with the garlic knots, but everything is amazing. Staff is always friendly. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"I never write reviews but I had to for these guys. They do things a little bit differently here compared to most places. As soon as we walked in the cashier introduced himself shook my hand, looked me in the eye, and asked for my wife and I's name.  He welcomed us then took our order. We ordered a large Sicilian pizza and some garlic knots. Tony said first time customers ALWAYS get something free so he gave us the garlic knots on the house!

When we got our pizza we were a little disappointed just because it was the wrong type of pizza. I asked if this was the right one and it seems like there was a mix up on the order (not surprised, they were super busy on a friday night)

Tony came out and immediately apologized asked if we wanted to change it out. Since i hate being that customer, I told him now worries. Despite that Tony said he wanted us to still try it and was going to give us some slices for FREE. And I am so glad he did the sicilian pizza was amazing! Super fluffy, cheesy, saucy goodness. And the slices were huge!

Tony knows the value of customers and how to treat them right. I told tony we will be coming back (especially for the Sicilian) 

Key takeaways:

Owner or Manager Tony is the man! He knows business and how to satisfy a customer. 
FREE Garlic Knots
FREE slices of pizza

5 Star Review all the way. Thank you Tony, we will be back."}
{"text":"So all the hype is for real! :-)  Tony DOES greet everyone, shakes their hand and asks their name. I was a female in by myself and didn't feel the least bit uncomfortable. I had a slice of the thick and a slice of the thin white. Both were delisio, but the NY deep dish was my fav! Tony was always walking around chatting with everyone. Definitely made you feel at home! Only suggestion (and it's just a picky one probably because I was there alone) would be to have someone take your order at the tables instead of needing to go up front to the cash register.

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"If your visiting Mesa or live here you HAVE to go here! It was seriously the best. We are in town from Utah and read the reviews and had to try it! I had the baked ziti and it was perfect, the other girls had pizza and were dreaming about it after. The people were amazing and the owner greeted us and made us feel so welcome! Definitely a must stop!"}
{"text":"The food and service is AMAZING!!!
Tony, the owner frequently check on us, addressed us by our names...we became the lost members of their Italian family.  Thank Tony and Noah.  You made us feel special."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff and owner. Tony introduced himself, shook my hand and gave me some complimentary garlic knots (which were awesome). I was in kind of a hurry so I just ordered a flight to go but I have to say this the best pizza I've had outside of New York! This place is for sure the only place in Arizona I have found that has legitimate New York style pizza. you know that crispy, fold in half kind? every other place that says they have New york-style is garbage compared to Cassanova Brothers. I will definitely become a regular!"}
{"text":"The food is great! Friendly staff! The caprese salad is amazing and the Calzones are perfect and enormous"}
{"text":"Not only is the food fantastic but from the second we walked in the door we were treated like family.such a caring owner and staff. They truly made a peaceful family pizza night into an unbelievably refreshingly wonderful night. Highly recommend this little pizza joint to anyone and everyone! Thank you Casanova bros!"}
{"text":"Im not an expert on traditional Italian, but the food was great at this place. The owners Mike and Toni were very welcoming on my first visit, very New York Italian like atmosphere, it doesn't get any better. It's a pretty nice experience, and it really makes the food taste even better when the service is top notch! Definitely will be visiting again soon!"}
{"text":"Ordered a veggie pizza for pick up.  It was ok, but in no way warrants all these five star reviews.  Somewhat skimpy on cheese and the sauce is tangy but very little spice.  The cheese didn't seem very flavorful.  Kids might like this type of pizza.  It wasn't bad, just not that good.  Maybe I'd try a calzone next time.  The place is closed on Sundays, so no pizza for football season.  When will they open a Giordano's in the East Valley?"}
{"text":"Really friendly & good service.  Food was great.  Will be back & make it a regular stop with the family!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  The owners work there, and are friendly, making sure to try to learn your name, and family. 

Food is fabulous  - cheese steaks, garlic knots, zeppoli's, salads ..... 

Best pizza in the valley!  New York lovers come one, come all!

Can't wait till they move into their new location on Val Vista!!!"}
{"text":"From the moment you walked in the door Tony makes you feel welcome and relaxed. Greeting you shaking your hand asking your name. The food was phenomenal. Had the fresh baked knots. Hot and good. The pizza was fantastic. We were seated in the bar area. The bartender seemed a little overwhelmed. Never checked back with us, asked the busboy to send him over so we could order a few more beers before our pizza came out.  But other than that everything was great. The pizza was fantastic. We had the 1/2 and 1/2 half white half marinara on a Sicilian crust.  Wow amazing.... top was soft and airy and the bottom was crunchy and fantastic..Will definitely go back.  Tony even said bye to us by name.   This place will put you in a great mood and the food is fantastic.."}
{"text":"The owner greeted me with kindness and a welcoming attitude.  I mentioned it was my first time there and he made me feel special by announcing to the staff that I was here and to get some garlic knots and home made sauce going.  He gave me this sampler on the house and they were fresh hot and great.  I had a slice of cheese that was done the way New York Pizza should be, simple and subtle with quality ingredients, crust that you would never leave on the plate, its worth finishing each slice to completion.  The place is clean and has a New York feel to it. Can't wait to try more stuff on the menu, I'm sure based on my first experience it will be Great.  Go check them out."}
{"text":"LOOOOVE this place. Awesome NY style pizza, sandwiches, calzones and service! It's one of my favorite places for lunch. Call ahead to order if you are in a hurry - they will have it hot and ready for you to eat when you get there."}
{"text":"Deeelightful! As soon as we walked in we were greeted with such happiness. The pizza was delish, I dont have much to say about the salad. But coming from Chicago, the pizza was great and I would for sure go back if I was in the area."}
{"text":"I have nothing bad to say ever about his place. EAT LOCAL AND EAT HERE. This family owned pizza place is great. Super friendly. The pizza is to die for. Eat a slice or the whole thing. Also honey hot BBQ wings are delicious along with their garlic knots. You really can't go wrong eating here."}
{"text":"Food is really good but service is always terrible. I was hoping it would get better since they moved to a larger location but only appears to have gotten worse.  Don't get me wrong,  people are super nice but move at the speed of snail.  Food often comes out cold,  thank goodness it still tastes good cold."}
{"text":"I'm from New York and have had my fair share of pizza. I have a tendency to be underwhelmed even when an establishment earns excellent reviews. Okay, I admit it, I'm a pizza snob. I wasn't the least bit disappointed after visiting with the Casanova Brothers. The young lady who answered the phone was friendly and efficient. The food was delicious and well priced. The shoutout as I was leaving thanking me for my business was a very nice old school touch."}
{"text":"You want GREAT Thin crust pizza? Get in your car and get your behind over here NOW!!! LOVE this place , great owners, Mike and Tony. Treat you like family. Love the Lasagna, sandwiches, and more!!! I give this place a big \"Woo Hoo\"!"}
{"text":"Very friendly and curious staff. The Neapolitan pizza was delicious! We did pepperoni and jalapeno peppers as our toppings. We were happily surprised with complimentary garlic knots, and dessert. It was our first time, and if we lived here we would go again and again!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and they made me feel like family! The garlic knots are great, made with real garlic!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic pizza!! The garlic knots are perfect (and not too garlicky). The service is the best and super friendly. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love this pizza place! The owner remembers me every time I come in, very hospitable. I have only had their calzones, and I think they are fantastic! Next time I go in I must try their pizza!"}
{"text":"Best NY style pizza in the valley! Try caprese and margarita. Also we love their eggplant parm or for something simple, spaghetti with marinara sauce ... Yummy homemade sauce."}
{"text":"Wonderful service!! Our first time in tonight and I was impressed, both Tony and Mike shook our hands and remembered our names. Why can't every pizza place be this good?? These guys totally understand the hospitality aspect and the pizza & wings were delivered quickly and very tasty!"}
{"text":"Based on a dinner order


0 stars for no delivery
 (Since the Yelp reviews give it such good ratings, We went to pick it up) 
5 stars for friendliness

Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Pizza is delicious! Absolutely love the family atmosphere. Both the owners are wonderful! This is a great local pizza joint. Excited for the new bigger location to open up!"}
{"text":"Great service! My friend from New York was craving NY-style pizza and luckily we accidentally stumbled upon this place. The first time we came in Tony was extremely hospitable and introduced himself and has remembered our names ever since! He also gave us 6 free garlic knots on our first visit, but that's not the best part.  They're pizza is phenomenal!! The crust is always perfectly thin, but never dry like some other places, and the toppings are really fresh.  I always get anchovies with my white pizza and a lot of places I've been to serve frozen anchovies, but here they are fresh.  My go-to order here is the white pizza with garlic, anchovies, and basil. I can never get sick of it! The fried zucchini is also great, not the frozen kind but fresh zucchini fried on the spot. This place is definitely a must-go-to joint if you love pizza!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were recommended to try this place a few months back from a coworker. From the first time we arrived till our last visit they have treated us like family. 

Definitely try their margarita pizza! We've had it once and have been hooked ever since!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! We heard about this delicious pizza from a friend and decided to make the trek from San Tan Valley to Mesa. Totally worth the drive. The pizza was great, even my daughter thought so and she is not a pizza lover. 
The staff was great! As soon as I walked in I was greeted by Tony. He asked our names, mine and hubby's, then proceeded to advise the staff we came all the way from San Tan Valley to eat. They all welcomed us. 
The sweet girl brought us free garlic knots since it was our first visit there as well. 
Then as we were eating Tony came to the tables to ensure we were enjoying our pizza. He even addressed my husband by his first name again. A bit later he came to check on us and brought us a box for our leftover pizza. Thanked me by my first name for coming. 
We will for sure be making the drive to see them again for pizza!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing Tony was great he greeted us and cause this was our first time he gave us free yes free garlic knots and I could eat them all day. We drove 45 mins to get the food and let me tell you worth every minute."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Pizza is delicious and the owners were so welcoming- as if I had been coming here for years! I will be back here for sure!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time this weekend. I kept seeing their signs for slices all day everyday and decided to finally give it a go. We live right around the corner. We opted for a whole pie 18\" mushroom. It was awesome! Im particular on the sauce and theirs is perfect! Not too rich, not too dull either! We got the special which was 18' one topping with a dozen wings and half dozen garlic knots. The wings were spot on! Not soggy but were crunchy and well cooked! Great sauce! We will def me back again soon! The Sicilian pizza sounds amazing! We'll get that next."}
{"text":"We were in the lot grabbing a new washer and remembered we'd been in before and wanted to come back. We finally made it back. They've moved location but only to just across the way. The new location feels a little less intimate than the previous one however, it also feels bigger and more open. I also like the decor of photographs and the Italian feel the whole place has. 

The hostess was awesome! She greeted us and let us take a seat at the bar. It was bit later in the afternoon when we arrived and figured we'd have a beer while we waited for our pizzas. 

As I said, we figured we'd have a beer... We'd have a beer.... We'd have a beer, if there were anyone behind the bar or anyone who asked us if we wanted a beer. A bit frustrating as the man was thirsty and just wanted a beer. Even just a water would have worked for me until that beer could be ordered. 

Eventually, the hostess came by asked if we were doing okay and we asked if we might be able to get some beers. Based on the checking in I thought there must have been a reason she herself wasn't able to pour for us, which is entirely understandable. However, she did put our food order in for us to get it started (Thank goodness). She then went off and found whomever the chick was that was likely supposed to be tending bar. The service at the bar was not good at all. I was surprised that the two gents who were already sitting there when we arrived were actually helped after us and still there when we left. I was also surprised because when we first came into Casanova Brothers, the gentleman who was there at the time was just a really friendly and accommodating man. In this moment, I imagined that had he been there this day, the bar service would have likely been on point and the staff would be visible. 

Nevertheless, we waited our 45+ minutes for our pizzas and knew what we were looking at as far as wait time (thanks to the hostess) and took them home to share. I loved the veggie pizza (with spinach, next time I'm with broccoli). Although I'm not personally a fan of deep dish and that's what the man selected, it wasn't too doughy overall just too doughy for me, if that makes any sense? 

Next time, we'll likely call in our order, skip the beers and just devour the pizza."}
{"text":"The owners are awesome. Classic Italian attitude and classic Italian family feel. Pizza is decent.  Garlic knots are really good. Pizza is good, but not my favorite style of pizza. Still a great spot to check out and hang with friends. Worth a try for sure."}
{"text":"I've come to realize that Gilbert restaurants are not held to the same standard as metropolitan areas. Don't believe the reviews. This place is below mediocre. I would've given this place one star but gave it two stars because the staff was friendly. I make better pizza at home."}
{"text":"My wife and I are new to the area, we relocated from San Diego, CA, and after having an awesome dinner here, we have a new a favorite place: Casanova Brothers! Awesome food, awesome service! Tony was really accommodating, and our server was funny and had plenty of suggestions. Superb guest service and they make you feel family!!"}
{"text":"Let's just say it wasn't $46 good, yea the co-owner tony was very nice but I rather pay for the food being good instead of someone greeting me with a hand shake. The pizza was good but so is other places closer to me, I guess I'm trying to say I won't drive 30 mins out of my way and then wait another 45 mins for two average pizzas. At the end we ordered cannolis, which were great tasting however, they were the size of my thumb for $1.49 each.... idk I wish this place was as good as all the reviews were."}
{"text":"Holy good service! What an intro. The owner Tony came out and introduced himself. Shook all our hands and gave us a warm welcome. Served us some delicious garlic bread balls while we waited for our pizza. Honestly I didn't care if the food was going to suck....I would of come back just based on the service....but the food was amazing! Like seriously amazing! Grimaldis is our spot....or was our spot...this place is now our spot! The cheesecake was A-mazing and the cannolis...holy moly I'm in love! So glad we found this spot! I can't explain how wonderful it is to actually come into a restaurant that is family owned and run and the service is on point and the food is to die for...oh and did I mention it's affordable! Great food, great service, great everything!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for some authentic Sicilian pizza! Owner and staff were extremely friendly and made it a point to get to know us for our first time in. So far, this is the best pizza I've had in the valley!"}
{"text":"A friend who is starting his diet treated a few us to his last big eating out at his favorite place for pizza!   When you first walk in you notice right away all the old photos of actors & New York and the Yankees! On the tv screen was playing the original Superman and on the radio was Frank Sinatra singing to us!  We walked in and were headed to a table when the server asked if it was our 1st time here, we said yes for some of us it was, he then offered us free garlic knots, man that is some heaven in dough! Couldn't get enough of the garlic knots!  We wound up ordering a cheese pizza, which by far is my favorite; it was simple, tomato sauce, cheese and great pizza dough! We also ordered a white pizza with sausage. The white pizza is made with whole milk ricotta, garlic butter & mozzarella, the white pizza was very good, but somehow I can't get used to a pizza with no red sauce. Over all this place was very good! I look forward to tasting my way though their menu!"}
{"text":"Great service. I met someone for dinner, the front hostess booth called me by name and showed me to my table. 
Server was excellent. Food was out in a timely fashion and was authentic tasting. I will be back."}
{"text":"What a great place.  So friendly!  The wings are awesome.  I love the cheese pizza!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Where do I start with this place? First off the service is amazing they gave us two orders of garlic knots for free and they were piping hot. Second we got our orders for take out and they have slices until they close and there's slices do not disappoint I am above and beyond impressed with this establishment definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal service, great food, clean bathrooms, complimentary garlic knots and I'd go back weekly if I didn't live in St. Louis. Definitely stop!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! The owner Tony makes you feel so welcome it's like you're eating at his house in his kitchen.A meatball sandwich was to die for and the pizza is out of this world. Thank you Tony and your staff for making this a memorable experience. We will be back"}
{"text":"Experienced amazing service and delicious New York style pizza during our first visit here. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Best pizza place in The Valley. Can't beat the warm friendly service that only comes from family run. Love you guys!"}
{"text":"Very good service. It was our first time there so they gave us 6 free garlic knots which were hot and delicious. The staff was very nice and I loved all the picture decor on the walls. With the help of Yelp we found this pizza spot and will be returning in the future."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town.  The owner is always friendly and remembers your name.  Even if you haven't been there in 3 months he will still remember you or try to even after1,000 people have come in.  The wait is a little long for pizza some times but who cares when the food is so good! We will always be loyal to this place and support the local business it has grown into. Get the knots and a pepperoni pizza!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place more than 5 stars I would.  We ordered the deluxe and a side salad.  The hostess (I can't remember her name) was exceptionally nice and suggested a large salad since it was the same size but cheaper than 2 smalls.  Not many people take the time any more to offer such a courtesy!  

Tony, one of the owners, even took the time out to come introduce himself and talk to me since it was my first time there.  I love how when one of the customers was leaving, he said goodbye to him and called him by his name.  What wonderful service this place has, and fantastic food!  Will definitely be back and suggest this place to others!"}
{"text":"Amazing food these guys know what they're doing! We had the special that comes with pizza, wings and garlic knots which was enough for my family of 4! We also ordered a calzone which was incredible!! Casanova Bros has top notch service that you don't get at ANY big chain restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"This is the BEST pizza and Italian food restaurant you will find in Gilbert/Mesa/Phoenix area! Tony Casanova is truly the nicest guy you will ever meet. He will ask for your name so he can welcome you on a first name basis every time you stop in, is very friendly and makes every visit exceptional with his hospitality! The FOOD itself is simply OUTSTANDING, and I have tried many of the items on the menu. The baked ziti is incredible, with the best sauce & cheese you will find on this dish. The baked manicotti is another amazing dish, with the perfect blend of ricotta and sauce. The Sicilian style pizza AND regular New York style pizza are exceptional, again the sauce they make there combined with the bread/cheese is just perfect (at least in my opinion)! I just tried their fettucine alfredo the other day as well, and WOW is that a superb dish! The alfredo sauce puts ANY other alfredo sauce I have tried to shame, and I have tried many! They also have some DELICIOUS 'garlic knots' that are served up with sauce for dipping, in addition to some tremendous dessert offerings. To top it all off, I think the PRICES at Casanova Bros. are very reasonable for the quality being offered. I don't think I will ever find a better pizza or Italian dish anywhere in this entire area after having so many tremendous dishes at Casanova Bros.  Thank you Tony and staff! 5 out of 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I would give this place 5 stars just for the delicious pie, and another 5 for the service! Unbelievably good! 10 STARS!! Crazy right? I don't usually take the time to write a review unless I've had a bad experience and I want to warn other people or I've had such an amazing experience that I just want other people to go there and experience the same joy I felt. This review is definitely the latter type. We were visiting from out of town and my pregnant wife was craving some pizza. A quick Yelp search showed Cassanova Bros near the top for the best pizza in the area. We went and from the moment we walked in the door we were greeted with a very sincere and warm welcome from the man Tony himself. He asked our names, asked if we'd ever been and then promptly gave us some free garlic knots because we were first timers. By the way he remembered my name and repeatedly came over to our booth throughout and said things like, \"Austin, Aubree, you doin okay over here? How's it tasting? Can I get you anything?\" He even told us some funny pizza anecdotes. (\"I told him gimme a slice a pie, and he said I don't run a bakery this a pizza place and I said no a slice a pizza pie and he said we don't sell by the slice so I said forget about it and opened up my own place!\") We ordered by the slice, red and white, and I got a slice of Sicilian which was delicious! The thin crust Tasted like true blue New York pizza that I've had at a few of the most well known NYC joints. Our slices came out fast and were so delicious but the real joy was watching Tony go to work. He got hit with a huge flood of customers, but he opened up another cash register got someone on it, and rang up all those orders in no time, and he already knew most of their names and some of their orders! I got a refill and told him I could see why he got great reviews and he just said, \"I run a tight ship Austin. No holes.\" He wasn't kidding. Great dining experience, we can't wait to go back. DONT MISS OUT ON THIS SPOT!"}
{"text":"Me and my wife are real picky about the places we eat at.. so I heard about this place and decided to come check it out. The only word that comes to mind is amazing!! the food was delicious and the owner Tony was there greeting everybody! And when I say greeting everyone I mean everyone in the building!! He remembers people's names, their family members just amazing!!! If you are feeling like some great Italian food I highly recommend this place!! Thanks Tony!!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow! Talk about awesome customer service! Was greeted by Tony as soon as I walked in, asked if it was my first time.. Gave me a great pizza by the slice suggestion. Yes, he also gave me some free knots which were delicious. I'd suggest this place to anyone who wants to have awesome pizza and an experience."}
{"text":"First off, the staff was amazing.  Kind and friendly right off the bat.  Eggplant parm was really good,  canzones are awesome.  Fresh pizza dough,  best ricotta cheese ever!  come check it out.  Taste of New York!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars
Very good pizza by the slice and great service and people! Quick, inexpensive, and tasty meal."}
{"text":"Nice work guys! Great service and the food was very good. Loved the lasagna, pasta, pizza, all of it!"}
{"text":"As a foodie, I'm always in search of the next great place to satisfy my hunger. The Casanova brothers definitely know how to run a business! I'm on crutches currently and one of the brothers saw me coming up to the door and he hustled from behind the counter to help me. Both of them greeted us with open arms and A desire to make sure we were 100% happy before we even knew what this place was all about. We exchanged greetings and names and they treated us like we were family. I found me a nice comfortable table to rest the broken sea leg at and gazed at the menu. There is so much to choose from! Right on the counter is the glass display with white pizza, Sicilian and regular pizza plus the extras like garlic dough (knot) balls. The owners treated us to some of their garlic dough (knot) balls since this was our first time in. I must say, I was quite impressed. For some reason people always seem to mess these up and the Casanova brothers fine-tune and perfect this recipe. After these delectable little appetizers were devoured it was time for the real deal. I ordered the 2 slice lunch special with a drink. Upgraded to Sicilian and I added meatballs and pepperoni to the mix. My girlfriend had the 2 slice meal as well with a regular piece of pie and a slice of the white pie. Both with pepperoni and jalapeños. In no time at all our table was covered in some of the best pizza I've had in a very long time! It's probably been 15+ years since I've had a true Sicilian slice of pie. Back in the day my buddy came from the Bronx and he opened up a pizza joint here in the AZ desert. Ordered every item from back home in order to make sure his pies were perfect! Only problem, he had to charge 20 bucks for a pie and back then that was a lot of money.... Back then most people didn't appreciate quality like the foodies of today. This thick, perfectly crusted gooey centered slice of Sicilian masterpiece with homemade meatballs and perfect pepperoni brought me back to the days of old. I can remember my buddy teaching me his secrets from dough to toppings all in one bite at Casanovas. This pie was so delicious I felt a shamed of myself for not wanting to share it with my girlfriend. Lol. But of course, she was so willing to share her experience with me so I felt obliged. The normal pie was good but quite honestly the white pie was off the charts. 

Before our meal had a chance to settle we were treated to another masterpiece. You can't come into an Italian home and not try the cannoli. That right there my friends tells you if there a true Italian. The cannoli was spot on! Perfectly displayed on our dish and more perfectly devoured by yours truly. 

I've had this place bookmark for a while now because of the awesome reviews I've seen and I can't believe that it took me forever to get over here. First place that comes to mind when I want pizza is Casanova brothers. Exceptional, over-the-top, just like if you were family service and the food is 100% perfectly Italian."}
{"text":"Loved it in its entirety! The vibe in the place is very mom and pop and everyone working there is super nice and authentic with their customer service. Pizza is delicious and can't get enough of the knots! My only complaint is that I forgot to try the dessert :(. Only another reason to go back!! :) Thank you for a yummy lunch today!"}
{"text":"Really good. Seems authentic. Food is fresh. Great people behind the counter."}
{"text":"Thank you for such a warm welcome as a new customer. The customer service was awesome and I was greeted with free garlic knots as a newbie. I searched out your place because you are one of very few places that serves Sicilian pizza!
The pizza had a perfect Sicilian crust with a sweet tomato sauce. 

I will return when I am back in town!"}
{"text":"All I can say is I wish they were closer so we could come very week. My husband LOVES..he says the best pizza in AZ and closest to NY style. Owner is super friendly."}
{"text":"Fantastic meal, great hospitality from Tony. Family and I stopped by for dinner of lasagna, Alfredo and meatball sub and were very pleased. The lasagna was full of fresh tasty ingredients and covered in a delicious marinara. The Alfredo was very rich and tasty. The sub was delicious with more marinara. A side of garlic knots to start and Italian style beignets (don't know the proper name) to finish and we were quite happy. My only disappointment was no liquor license for a glass of chianti.
Thank you Tony!"}
{"text":"This is the best New York style pizza I have ever had in AZ.  I recommend them to all my friends!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service!! Such a rarity.  I love the Calzones.  They take a while to make, but you are notified prior to ordering and expectation is in place."}
{"text":"The new restaurant in the same plaza is much bigger and wonderfully decorated.  Tony and his team have an outstanding job.  Food was excellent as always.  Favorites include the lasagna, garlic knots and homemade cannoli.  Customers are treated like family."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Pizza in the valley. Tony is the best. He always greets you when you enter the front door. Top notch. I would not go anywhere else. Garlic knots are outstanding as well."}
{"text":"Great food, great pizza and great environment!! My husband is a huge fan. We ordered this for a party and some of the toughest pizza critics loved it!!"}
{"text":"Awesome and delicious pizza, only matched by fantastic customer service! Tony immediately made us feel right at home and was very welcoming. Glad we stopped in to check it out. This place is dream for any New Yorker hanging out in Arizona. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! My first visit since you moved into new location did not disappoint with the exception of the waitress calling me Sweetheart, Darlin', Honey. I asked for extra marinara and received a tablespoon. At least fill up the tiny cups. Still delicious though!!"}
{"text":"Tonight, we expected to eat the greatest pizza of all time along with some of the best service in Mesa orchestrated by Tony. To our surprise, when we showed up we noticed that Tony wasn't working today. We went forward to place our order (bbq chicken/margherita split pizza and an order of wings) and proceeded to sit down to wait for our food. An hour and 7 minutes later, we were served our food. The food, although DELICIOUS (Seriously; some of the best I've ever had) is definitely not worth an hour wait. 

However, what really killed the experience for us was not the wait time. It was the staff's inability to confront the situation. We continuously got glances toward our table and were never acknowledged. Not once did a staff member approach us to apologize or to even notify us of what was happening with our order. 

After 50 minutes of waiting, I approached the register where the girl working the register immediately said \"Iván! Your pizza should almost be ready\" and walked to the back. No matter how awesome it may be that she remembered my name, the fact that she knew there was an issue and it wasn't tackled until I approached the register left me feeling like just another sale in a day of business.

When we were served our pizza, I mentioned to the girl who served us that it had been over an hour of waiting to which she responded \"Yeah it's been backed up. We've messed up a lot today\" and walked away. (I stared blankly at my friend who joined me after this; still no apology)

We proceeded to eat out pizza, which as always, was really REALLY good. As we were about to leave, we asked another staff member for a box and before we got up she was the only one who apologized for the wait but then lead up with a \"I'm really ready to go home. Everyone is messing up today. It's been horrible\" (I feel for you kid)

Seems to be that the only day to eat at Casanova Brothers is when Tony is there. Otherwise, you may be in for a longer than average wait while being under-acknowledged by the staff. 

Get it together guys. We love your pizza and it pains me to be giving you anything less than 5-Stars."}
{"text":"This place has awesome thin crust!!! Someone from New York recommended I come here and it's very authentic. They have great lunch specials and also gave me extra garlic knots for it being my first time here. Although I'm from Chicago and am used to deep dish, this place is a must"}
{"text":"I ordered take out and Joe was extremely kind and professional over the phone. When I picked up my order he was just as polite and professional which made me feel good about where I chose to spend money. We ordered the lasagna and a pizza and boy were they both amazing!! My husband is from NY so he's picky about his pizza and he approved so that speaks volumes ! We will be back not only because the food is amazing but the customer service is as well! I highly recommended them!"}
{"text":"I have had Casanova Bros about 4-5 times. Here is my feedback and reasoning for the 3 star rating.

1. Food: 4.5 stars, really good pizza & pasta dishes. Really good sandwiches as well, just a little small for the price.

2. The place: Cool place, cool pics hanging up on the walls.
3. The dudes behind the counter: Really cool guys, they treat you like they want your business.
4. Customer Service: Ok here it is, here is the reason I could only give these guys 3 stars and not the 4.5 they deserve on taste alone. General customer service is great, really friendly people who take pride in what they do. But.......................I can't stand when places get my order wrong and even these guys did too. I understand people make mistakes and I am cool with that. My latest experience was ordering a couple xl calzones and one was supposed to be loaded with peppers, sausage, mushrooms, and onions and it came with just cheese.....................Man! Damn! I bit into that thing waiting for all that and all I got was cheese :(..... Still good, but I paid for all that other stuff. Now I'll give it to these guys again, I called them for improvemet opportunities to inform them of the mistake and they told me to come back anytime and get a free xl calzone. I could not do that though, because I ate the whole thing a would not feel right doing so."}
{"text":"We just LOVE this place! Definitely reminds us of back home in NY. Pizza is always good and we just love the fresh to order calzones. Yum!!!

On top of great food and a delicious sauce the service is amazing. The owners make an effort to make you feel at home and makes an effort to know you by name. 

Whenever we come in we always chat with the owners and leave full and satisfied. 

Oh and they make zeppoles!!!! Did I say I love this place?"}
{"text":"Drove all the way from California for this pizza !! It did not disappoint! First time customer so I got free garlic knots ! What a great personal touch ! I have never seen an owner like this before! Worth the drive !  This is a place like CHEERS.. \"Sometimes you wanna go.. where everybody knows your name\""}
{"text":"Wow, what an incredible and delicious pizza.  The staff and owner are really nice.  The owner was very active and involved with the dining room.  He asked if it was our first time.  Gave us a sampling of delicious garlic knots and zeppolis.  Once our pizza was delivered, he came by again to check if we enjoyed it.  He checked in with other customers.  

Pizza is divine. We got a large with premium topping of ricotta.   My daughter and I ate half of it-saved the rest for leftovers. The sauce is tasty; crust crispy - holds its shape.  So good.  Can't wait to visit there w my husband next time.

Great atmosphere. They redecorated the old Serrano restaurant and the decor looks great."}
{"text":"I drove by a few times as I am new to the neighborhood and decided to stop in for a slice during my lunch break!  I was met with a warm welcome and a firm handshake from Tony. I was sat promptly and Tony came by and dropped off complementary garlic knots for being a first time guest! They were so warm and fluffy I could have just had that! Tony then came back for my order, I went with the lunch special of 2 slices for $4.99 what a deal! The place was clean and the service was over the top and the food was amazing!!! 5 starts across the board!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and both times have been awesome!  My kids love their pizza and the staff is warm and welcoming!  My new favorite Italian neighborhood joint!"}
{"text":"Omg. I don't even know where to start. 

Well I do. My first experience here was actually second hand. My BF went down here to grab a to-go-menu. (We're new to the neighborhood and saw great reviews). The owner didn't have any, HOWEVER, he offered free garlic knots to take home instead. When I got home from school, three were left for me to eat. OMG what deliciousness. Score! 

So we decide a few weeks later to come down and give this place a try. (Side note, I do make my decisions about where I eat mainly on how I get treated... I'll always give places more chances if they're nice). With that being said, we walked in and immediately were greeted by the owner. He recognized my boyfriend from a few weeks ago which is A+ in my book! 

We sat in a booth and were approached by a waiter. He was so kind and quick! Took our beer order and brought us more garlic knots on the house! YASSSSSSS! We asked a few questions about the items, and like the fattys that we are, we ordered a pizza, an entree, and of course... dessert. 

I ordered the chicken parmigiana. (Spelling?) OMG CAN YOU SAY HEAVEN ON A PLATE? The serving was huge! The chicken had an amazing layer of melted cheese on top, and the sauce was delicious. It definitely did not disappoint! My BF ordered a half white half red pizza. DROOOOOOOL that pizza was by far, THE MOST AMAZING PIZZA IN THE WORLD. My Bf loved it. I personally like the white more because it was so different from all other pizzas I've tasted. But both of them were out of this world. 

Service was still great; and the owner walked around and came to every table to make sure everything was good. Thats the kind of welcoming, family environment I look for. 

Now, onto the cannolis. They tasted like Home made! With frank Sinatra playing in the background, I honestly god teary eyed. I couldn't stop smiling. The food, the family like environment, the New York signs and photos of amazing actors... I cried tears of joy. And no I'm not exaggerating. 

You HAVE to come here. On our first try they've gained life long customers. Can not recommend this place enough. Thank you so much for such an amazing evening."}
{"text":"I've only been here once but the lasagna was some of the best I've ever had.  The noodles were homemade and the sauce was bomb as hell.  Also tried pizza and I had no complaints... thin, crisp, and great sauce."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the east valley? Maybe so. Not only that, the staff is awesome and extremely friendly. I just moved close to these guys and plan to become a regular already!"}
{"text":"Took my daughter to celebrate her passing the second block of nursing school with our entire family, the service was out of this world. The owner came over to introduce &'congratulate her, few minutes later comes to hand her a baskets of their famous garlic knots as a token of grangratulaions! Then, he brought us all sampler of their dessert balls after we finished our meal. Just amazing service overall. Now, as far as the food...it totally matched the 5-star service we received. We ordered the Alfredo, wow, never in my life have we had alfredo taste that delious! We also order three x-large pizza pies...best way to eat these bad boys is right out of the oven...unbelievable experience and taste!!!!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here I wonder why I don't come more often! It never disappoints! They recently moved across the parking lot to a new building and the ambiance was awesome! We ordered a \"Tony Special\" 1/2 sausage and spinach with white sauce and 1/2 sausage and pepperoni with red sauce! Amazing! If you haven't gone here lately, come! So good!"}
{"text":"Always looking for a great local places. This one lived up to our expectations. Owner greeted us with a smile and handshake. Made a point to call us by name. Shared some wonderful garlic knots w their homemafe red sauce. We ordered the white sicilan pizza and a calzone. Huge slices w fresh ricotta and sliced sausage, crust was crunchy with a garlic butter hint. Calzone also huge and filled w delious cheese blend. Only con was the time but that's because it was made fresh!! No premade pies. Our new pizza favorite."}
{"text":"I love this place! Tony the owner remembers every single customer by name and is very nice and runs a great restaurant! His staff is great. Food is wonderful and love the calzones!!  Cute environment. Very classy but casual. Perfect place for any occasion. ;) Tony has this bizness
Thing down!"}
{"text":"Just like New York!  Great Friendly family service! The food...Ah-mazing!  We wanted to try everything- we settled on the lasagna, baked ziti, and meat ravioli. We also got a side of meatballs and tried a slice of white pizza. All were sooooo yummy- the sauce was perfect! We will be back because there is so much more to enjoy!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine told me about this diamond in the rough NY style pizza place in the east valley and they did not dissapoint.  I was on my way home from work after picking up the kids when I decided to order some takeout.  I'd read about their pizza, wings and knots special online and thought it would be enough for my family of 6.  

Louie answered the phone and took my order, then went another step and asked if I had ordered there before.  I mentioned I was a first timer and he responded by saying that he wished to welcome me to the family :-)  He added that they were going to throw in an extra 6 garlic knots along with my order to say thank you for giving them a try.  Upon my arrival I met Louie at the counter, he shook my hand and said it was a pleasure to meet me and thanked me again for coming in.  My order was ready a few minutes later and I was off.  

Now for the food:  I've been living in Arizona for 32 years and in that time I have not had better pizza and wings.  The crust was crunchy on the outside and still soft on the inside.  The cheese was zesty and flavorful while the sauce was super robust with fresh tomato flavor.  BUT THOSE WINGS!....My wife in particular was partial to them, the buffalo sauce tasted truly authentic, we went with the medium for a perfect balance of heat and flavor.  

Overall: If you want to feed the family some 5 star food and receive 5 star service yet only have to pay a 1-2 star price, this local eatery needs to be a mainstay for you and yours.  I plan to return very soon."}
{"text":"First time in with family and we LOVED it. The owner Tony greeted us when we came in and asked if we had been in before. Because we hadn't he gave us a free order of garlic knots, which of course were tasty! We ordered the chicken parm entree, eggplant parmigiana entree, and a meatball sub. The sauce was definitely one of the best I've had here in AZ. Prices are reasonable especially given the quality of food and the level of service. Absolutely recommending and we will be back."}
{"text":"I have slowly watched this place deteriorate over the last two years I have lived in the area.  We have watched the owner work hard to maintain his relationships with the customers while not improving the operation when he is not at the restaurant.  Orders are lost, the level of professionalism changes and the wait times are almost doubled.   The pizza is delicious .... But I am sitting here going on an hour and a half for a large pie that was supposed to be ready 20 minutes ago.  There have been other mishaps and confusion with orders and poor service that I could mention, but the bottom line is overall I have been pretty disappointed by the Brothers from New York."}
{"text":"My first time going was tonight and it was a great experience.  Greated as soon as you walk in the door and wait staff was awesome. Will definitely be returning. 
Thank you Chris and Tony"}
{"text":"We were greeted by Nicole when we first came in. Tony walked around and spoke to all of the customers. They made you feel very welcomed. Our food was excellent...especially the wings. We are definitely coming back. Great price and lunch specials."}
{"text":"And I can see why this place gets high reviews! 
My little one and me enjoyed visiting this restaurant. Not only does the owner speak to you but the entire crew says hi and calls you by your first name. 

The garlic knots while we waited for our deluxe pizza was outta this world. Once we got home we enjoyed the pizza just as much. 

We will be back for sure. Thank you for the amazing service!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place because of the Yelp reviews.  We did take-out and ordered a regular crust with meatball pizza and some medium wings.  The service at the pick-up counter was average to good.  The wings were ok, but the pizza was not good at all.  There was hardly any sauce or cheese, and the crust was chewy to hard in texture.  Honestly, it was one of the worst pizzas we have had.  Maybe we caught them on an off night, or maybe it is better to dine in.  We wanted to love this place, but unfortunately, it didn't go as well as we expected from the reviews."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying the staff at Casanova Bros. are very pleasant, care about the customer, and have a good sense of humor, so I like the establishment and want it to do well.  However, the current Yelp rating of 5 stars is overrated.  I'm giving it a 3 and couldn't possibly see justifying anything higher than 4.  This is not even close to being the best pizza in Gilbert, let alone a larger area.  It's slightly better than average pizza.  

We tried a pepperoni pie, garlic knots, and zeppolis.  All three were fine, but there was nothing impressive or memorable about them in any way.  Again, the most memorable thing about Casanova's is the staff, and that's a reason to go back.  If I lived very close it would probably be a place I'd go to semi-regularly, but living several miles away I don't think it would be worth the drive.  I'd go to Patsy Grimaldi's, Jimmy's of Chicago, Liberty Market, Joe's Farm Grill, Oregano's and possibly even Venezia's  before I'd choose Casanova Bros."}
{"text":"I am from Long Island and I know good pizza (Colosseo Pizza - Port Jefferson, none better). Let me say for Arizona this is it!! The regular pizza is delicious and the Sicilian is great as well, looks heavy but its light and crusty, mmmmmmm. The garlic knots are decent but sometimes too garlic-ey and they ruin them by MICROWAVING them. I have learned to ask for my knots in the oven, much better. I tried the White Sicilian the other night and that too was fabulous. The Chicken Parm. hero is delicious as is the Meatball. The only thing that I was not happy with was the salad, got it only once and kinda blah on the homemade dressing. I also wish they would make some cold pizza (such as Salad or Caprese slices). The 2 owners are very friendly as is most of the staff. It is a lengthy drive for me from Queen Creek but I make it about once a week to feel like I am back in the \"Old Country\" (Coram, NY) lol!   I am not a fan of toppings on my pizza so I am not sure how those are except for the sausage and spinach I got on the White Sicilian, that was terrific and they use Grande Cheese, just like in NY! If you love NY pizza... GO HERE!!!  -Al"}
{"text":"I called repeatedly the today from around 6pm with no answer and it said mailbox was full. Website, advertisement I have and yelp all say the restaurant is open until 7pm. I am very disappointed. I can only assume they are closed for the holiday weekend?"}
{"text":"Great place the food is fantastic the atmosphere great and awesome service tony is very nice love this place will be back many times"}
{"text":"My favorite NY style pizza place in the whole wide world!  They have a Sicilian pizza that even one slice will stuff you silly.  Their dough is perfect.  I love their pasta dishes too.  And the service?  They greet you right from the door and the good service does not stop until you leave the place with a warm \"goodbye and see you soon.\"  :)"}
{"text":"Friendly service, authentic atmosphere and delicious NY pizza! A place to enjoy dinner with family and friends."}
{"text":"Loved this place!! We decided to come try it  because of recent yelp reviews, and they didn't disappoint!:) The employees are the best and even call you by your first name. Some of the best customer service I have ever had in a restaurant. We had the antipasto salad, wings and pepperoni pizza and it was all GREAT! The wings were so good and crispy! We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"This place has good pizza with great prices. We also love the meatball subs! Not the fanciests of restaurants but perfect if you have kiddos! We love it!"}
{"text":"I am not a huge pizza fan, but when my husband told me about Casanova's, and how you can get it by the slice I decided to give it a try. This is a cute family owned pizza place located in a strip mall. The place is clean, and decorated to fit their Italian heritage. When you are a guest the first time they give you a free order of 6 garlic knots, and if you are a repeat guest, expect to be greeted by your first name when you go in! I love that personal aspect! I ordered one slice and a drink. I chose sausage, black olives and green peppers. Keep in mind they charge .50 cents per topping, worth every penny in my book. My slice came, and it was great! Cooked perfectly, thin, crispy crust with ample toppings. The cheese was gooey, just like I like it! The restaurant is clean, the friendly staff and the pizza makes this a 4 star pizza joint.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Took my Satan wife too eat here because she says I never take her anywhere so I found this place on yelp and the Meatball sub Rebuked the demons straight back too hell."}
{"text":"Casanova Brothers Pizza is a quaint, authentic Italian restaurant! We went for my niece's graduation last minute after our other reservations at a restaurant fell through. It was the best thing to happen because we had a great meal and family time at Casanova Brothers Pizza. We had garlic bread for an appetizer and I ordered a Caprese salad, absolutely delicious! For the main course I shared a delicious margherita pizza. The kids had spaghetti and meatballs and ate it well. The owner came in to check on us twice, it was really welcoming of him. It's a restaurant with a lot of family love and a place for you to eat some food made with love! Check out Casanova Brother Pizza for a nice meal, date, family event or a good glass of wine at th  snow or bar side. Thank you Casanova Brothers Pizza for making it a great celebration with my family!"}
{"text":"Went to casanova's recently, food was okay but not over-the-top good. What I did find to be very odd was the demeanor of the people that work there. They called everyone mr. Thomas mr. Blake, Mister Jerry, excetera over and over and over again and it just felt weird. It seemed like it was rehearsed and very insincere and did not at all. They need to just be themselves and be nice to people which I'm sure they can do"}
{"text":"I tried their cheese ravioli this time and it's so amazing! The sauce is wonderful! The new location is beautiful and this is worth the 45 minute drive every time my boyfriend and I come here."}
{"text":"Love my fellow Bronx natives. It has to be the only place here in Arizona that I enjoy for pizza. These guys know when you have been there before and seem to even know your name. For all the AZ people please go visit this place and you will understand the difference with New York pizza!"}
{"text":"My husband and I loved Casanova brothers pizza when it was in the smaller location. We just went to the new bigger location just a few doors down, and left a little disappointed. 
One of our favorite things about their food, that made them stand out from the rest, was the marinara sauce. 
They used to make this fresh pretty much everyday and it's no longer the same sauce anymore. The old sauce was amazing, and I'm sad to see it no longer being served.
The new marinara is not nearly as flavorful. The cheesy garlic bread is good but not the same without the older sauce. Same for the pizza, good crust but not as flavorful.

The food is still pretty good and if you didn't have their previous sauce you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My first job was pizza delivery guy in Newport Beach, CA when I was 16, so for the past 15+ years I've been a VERY amateur pizza critic. Well, I can say without ANY hesitation that the New York Special pizza from Casanova Brothers is THE BEST PIZZA I'VE EVER HAD!!!! And, almost everyone I've gone here with has said the same -- DA BEST!!!!

I've only lived here in Gilbert for 3 months, but the half a dozen times people have come to visit me we've gone here and none have EVER been disappointed. Tony, one of the owners, did a great job making us feel at home -- the free dough knots really helped! I had a friend out last night and guess where we went? I have more friends coming out in a couple days and where do you think we're going? It doesn't get old because they use the best ingredients and cook it just right. I have another friend that frequently texts me about wanting to come back, not to see me, but to eat here again!

I can't wait to go back!!! It's my birthday today so maybe I'll treat myself with a little pizza present :)"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza I have had in Arizona since I moved here from New York. Hands down"}
{"text":"Best pizza in AZ! Everytime we go Tony always greets us by name and makes sure everyone has the same experience. Sodas for customers waiting on their to go order.. garlic knots for first timers... and every customer is a family member to him! Amazing customer service and food!"}
{"text":"Great food and customer service!  Everything is always fresh there pasta sauce is amazing along with there desserts"}
{"text":"First timer- just moved here and have been searching for a good east coast pie. Food- GREAT, service OUTSTANDING!!! found my new joint and will spread the word. Thank You!"}
{"text":"My husband and I found this place on Yelp and decided to try it out.  We could not be happier!  The owners have to be the friendliest guys we have ever met.  We called them to ask about specials and they totally hooked us up and when my husband went to pick the pizza up they were the friendliest people you could ever want to meet.  Very personal....and the pizza, wings and garlic knots were AMAZING!!!!!  and you can't beat the price.....we found our new pizza place that we will be very loyal to......they are a MUST!"}
{"text":"I never really write reviews but this place deserves one! Some of the greatest costumer service I've experienced! The food is amazing too! This was our first time going and we will definitely be repeat guests!"}
{"text":"Not much to say about this place that has not already been said. Everything was amazing from beginning to end. Customer service was impeccable and the food was wonderful! My fiance had the lasagna and he said that it was the best he had ever had. All of the staff was polite and Louie (one of the owners I assume) was excellent. He remembered our names from the time that we placed our order until the time that we left. He also walked around the restaurant and shook everyone's hand while thanking them for coming. I can honestly say that I have never experienced such great customer service. Loved this place. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Owner was awesome! Food was awesome!"}
{"text":"Good marinara and garlic knots, crunchy flavorful salad and amazing pizza with a Crust Cooked to the perfection."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza spot. They also serve delicious pastas and their wings are to die for. Tony always remembers my family and is always very welcoming. All of the staff are extremely nice. I always look forward to coming here because not only do I know that I will get great customer service along with great food. I always feel like I'm at home when I come here."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today with my grandson (4ys). They don't have a kids menu but water says they are working on one. I ordered from the lunch menu 1 reg. slice & 1 sicilian slice (thick crust). They gave us an order of garlic knots complimentary. All the food was very good & nice price. They have a bar & 3 tvs that's all together in one dining room. Looked like they have another dining space maybe for larger crowds. Clean & friendly staff. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"From the moment you arrive it feels like home. The music, the food , the service is excellent. We love dining here."}
{"text":"This place is the pinnacle of what service and great food should be. We had both the meatball sandwich and a pizza and both were great. More importantly the friendly environment led by I'm assuming the owner tony was top notch. If you are looking for good food and a great environment this is the place."}
{"text":"Came here last week for the first time due to all of the amazing Yelp reviews and I ordered ahead of time for a pick up.  I usually order simple pizzas to make it quick and its hard to mess it up, so I asked for a large Neopolitan (thin-crust) cheese pizza and an order of Garlic Knots.  They told me it would take 35-40 minutes to make my pizza; it was late in the afternoon, but maybe they have an early-dinner rush(?).  The pizza was steaming hot and ready when I got there, but then the guy at the cash register handed me a box of the knots and told me \"30 seconds in the microwave and they will soften up\"... Um.. ?  HUH?   I wish he had given me fresh knots, I don't think it would have been that difficult. 

Pizza was pretty delicious, I LOVE thin-crust and the cheese was perfect, sauce was good, and crust was soft.  HOWEVER, maybe its because I had to microwave the knots, but yuck.  I bit into one and it was completely covered in pepper...  I don't think I would order these again.  I would give it a 4-to-5 for the pizza, but the knots and having to microwave anything I get from a restaurant makes me give it a 3/5.

Great location, off of Val-Vista next to a Water-&-Ice shop so you can always pick up some ice cream to go as well :)"}
{"text":"BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!! Food is delicious, staff is so friendly and warming, and the experience was such a surprise. I would go here purly for the nice people, the food is just an added bonus!!"}
{"text":"My favorite Pizzaria in Gilbert. The professional and warm behavior of the staff amazing. The food is always tasty and i love the building. I will never stop coming to this place."}
{"text":"Oh Casanova Brothers..... we love you. Every time we've been here, they've not only remembered our name, but they genuinely seem excited to see us. They make EVERYONE feel like their favorite person, and the pizza? Unbelievable. SO good. Even if the pizza was subpar, we'd keep coming for the service alone. Luckily, the food is to die for, so it's a win-win!"}
{"text":"The wife and I have been going here since they first opened. Tony and Mike make it look easy."}
{"text":"Super Pizza! You can't go wrong here. The Manager Tony is personable and is genuinely happy you're there... Our new pizza spot. Vickie and Lonnie"}
{"text":"I come here all the time and get a piece of cheese pizza. I know I'm probably one of their least-spending customers, but I appreciate how nice they are to me and the pizza is just amazing. I love their service and the food, you will too!"}
{"text":"I was brought here because Buzzfeed posted an article about the best pizzas in each state, and since I just moved out here, I made my boyfriend come with me eighteen miles from home to see what it was all about. When we first arrived, we decided we'd get the Neapolitan round thin crust with pepperoni and mozzarella sticks. As we came up to the register to order, the owner asked if we've ever been here before. We said no, and the cashier continued to take our order. The food came out really fast - hardly a wait - and to our surprise our first appetizer before our mozzarella sticks were garlic knots on the house. How awesome is that? They were so good! As well as the mozzarella sticks. I love all types of pizza and sometimes I just want thin crust and this really hit the spot! It was delicious! I love a pizza you can fold over. Every person of the staff was super nice and ready to help if we needed anything. I am so glad to see they're expanding into a new store soon -- good for them. This is a place to be but not only for the food but the service as well. Genuine people! Looking forward to coming back soon!

{"text":"Best wings in the East Valley if not Arizona.  We have been there twice now, the thin crust pizza first time, excellent pizza, might also be #1 but at least #2 on my list and yesterday had the Chicken Parm which also is excellent.  The flavor of the sauce is outstanding.  This is actually a 5+ rating.  Most definitely going back.  It's our new favorite Italian Restaurant.  Special KUDOS to the owner Tony, who remembered us from the previous visit and welcomed us back.  Extremely friendly and customer \"satisfaction\" trained staff.

This is one of the best and friendliest restaurants I have ever been too."}
{"text":"From the very first time I went here the service has been one of the best I have ever received. Tony is remarkable always remembers my name. The white pizza with spinach and Italian sausage is the best. Always take out of town guests here, and they always ask to go see Tony and enjoy the food. Can not go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience at Casanova Bros. Not many places will give you the small town, at home feeling even in small towns themselves anymore. Casanova Bros. gives you that feeling in a large metropolitan area. We ordered a pineapple/ham and the NY Deluxe I believe is what it was called (Meat Lovers). The Pizza was very good, came out in timely fashion, and was piping hot. Thanks Louie!"}
{"text":"ONE THE BEST PIZZAS IN TOWN!!!! This place is amazing and I'm so happy they got a bigger place for more business! Great service, great owner, great pizza, great environment, just perfect all around. Every pizza we have gotten from here has been perfect. The ingredients always taste fresh. The place is always clean and inviting. I could seriously rave about it forever. Just go check it out and see for yourself. Thank you guys. Good pizza is hard to find and thank glob we found you haha."}
{"text":"Awesome old school NY pizza joint. They've got eggplant parm sandwiches and Zeppoli's!"}
{"text":"This is a great place. My first time today!! I had Sicilian slice, not my norm, but it will be now!! Fresh and the sauce is awesome!! I found my new glue for Italian food!! Great job..I will be back for the cheese ravioli and Spaghetti/ meat sauce!!! Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Husband wanted fettucine alfredo for dinner so we searched Yelp for suggestions and tried Casanova's for the first time. We'll be back. Tony welcomed us like family and the food was delicious. Congratulations and Happy 8th Anniversary  to Casanova's. Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"Seriously, these guys are the nicest people you'll ever meet. They have a HUGE client base now and somehow manage to remember everyone's names. The pizza is incredible. Try the White pizza (thin crust) with spinach. It's amazing. Be sure to call WELL ahead (an hour or more) during prime dinner time, especially on a weekend, or you'll have quite the wait. I've had their entrees before as well, but the pizza is where it's at. Amaaaaazing."}
{"text":"So. Freakin. Good!

I had my first Casanova pizza yesterday and it did not disappoint! Had a pepperoni and cheese pizza. They even threw in some garlic knots for free since it was my first time . So nice and hospitable. Tony and the boy behind the counter introduced themselves to me. Will def be coming back!"}
{"text":"Awesome NY Pizza!!  Hands down the best pizza I have had in a very long time. 
Staff was awesome. Very friendly and gave us free garlic knots and desert balls in powder sugar. 
Can't ask for anything more. Will definitely be back again and again."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and saw the good reviews of this place on Yelp, so I decided to give it a try. Soooo glad I did! New York style pizza that tastes great and super friendly! We will definitely make this our pizza place!"}
{"text":"Ok.. I'm from long island ny and I really missed my pizza. I hate all the places here that claim to be from ny and then have horrible food. This place is not like that AT ALL. 

Finally!!! Garlic knots like back home and a real Sicilian pie!!! I can't rave about this place enough. Do yourself a favor and eat here."}
{"text":"You aren't going to find a better pie anywhere. Hands down, the best pizza in the valley. Been going here for takeout for years now. Always consistent. Never disappoints. And their Garlic knots are amazing. Gotta love Mike and Tony. I just wish they sold beer too! (That's why I do takeout)."}
{"text":"I've loved this place for years. Amazing food, even better service. They're very attentive to their customers-if it's a longer than usual wait will give me a drink or some garlic knots. 
My grandparents were born and raised in new York and my grandpa can walk in here and feel like he's back home with the awesome food and conversation with the owner. And the owner is always working. Is great to see a business owner not just sitting on their back sides!"}
{"text":"By far the best service and food I've ever had! The owner Tony is the nicest man you will ever come across!! I've been only a couple times and he always says hello to me by name!"}
{"text":"We have enjoyed this restaurant even before it moved to the new larger location. We really love the white pizza and it is definitely worth the wait. The management and owners are so nice and it is really cool that they remember their customers and try to make connections with them all. We went there Friday with some friends and ordered a regular crust white pizza and a Sicilian white pizza (thick crust). We were brought out the regular crust first and then later when the thick crust was ready they brought it out but it was the wrong pizza. The manager apologized and they said they would have our new pizza out in 15 min. Well, about 30 min later we finally got our other pizza. We were understanding but it was very frustrating to be at a restaurant hungry and have our pizza be made wrong and have to wait that long for our new pizza. Honestly, I was ready to just go home because I waited so long after eating a slice of the thin crust pizza that I wasn't excited for the thick crust anymore. Finally the new pizza came out and it was really good! However, nothing but an apology was done for us. Typically restaurants will at least comp a drink or dessert or part of the meal.  They did nothing but say sorry. I am fine with that, I'm not entitled to have something comped, but it wasn't in line with their usual outstanding customer service. We will still go back because we love the food and service, this was just one experience that was not in line with their usual service."}
{"text":"Best customer service I've ever seen! They really do make you feel like family. The food is great too, free garlic knots and zappolis for 1st time visitors. The owner comes out and goes around asking how the food and experience is. It was soo busy but well worth the wait, we will be back!"}
{"text":"What a great choice we made to come here. We made our decision based on the reviews and were glad we did.
We were promptly greeted on arrival by Tony, who in turn introduced us by name to the entire staff. Nice touch!
As we were seated, Tony arrived with the delicious garlic knots. We wolfed those down and he delivered a second order, both on the house. Another nice touch!
We ordered the special version of the pizza (round)and it was delicious. 
Service was prompt and friendly the entire visit.
Then Tony sent over some delicious cannoli for desert. (Also, on the house).

This place was far beyond my expectations.
We plan to return for a second visit tonight with 4 friends and introduce them to this awesome find!

Thank you to Tony and Staff! You guys are awesome."}
{"text":"Received a burnt pizza tonight.   Maybe a one time occurrence but they should have some quality control.  After waiting 45 minutes and driving home with this mess i'm too hungry to drive back to complain.   Based upon all the good reviews this doesn't happen much and I'll probably try them again,  but I'll check the pizza before I drive home."}
{"text":"Garlic knots.......Amazing!  Pizza......Amazing!  Very friendly  and attentive staff.  Great experience and even better food."}
{"text":"Finally tried Casanova Brothers last Saturday and unfortunately I was severely disappointed.  About 5 minutes after placing our orders, our server came back and told me they had run out of what I ordered. Very surprising for ANY restaurant on a Saturday evening.  So, I ordered something different.  When our meals arrived (about 20 minutes) it was my original order.  By now I was looking forward to what I ordered as the replacement - and the pasta on the plate was cold.  After another 5 minutes or so, I finally got the server's attention to remedy the cold pasta.  The server just shoveled my entree off onto an appetizer plate and went back in the kitchen.  Most professional places would take the entire plate back.  I was just left there.  About 15 minutes later, after I was done with my entree (didn't want it to get cold too), my pasta reappeared - just penne with sauce.  I didn't think it was rocket science to prepare pasta and sauce, unless you were a sushi restaurant.  The owner stopped by to see how it was going and I told him.  He seemed to not care in the least.  Also tried the pizza.  Coming from New York, I am very picky about my pizza.  I would rank it better than Papa John's but worse than NYPD, which I already graded very poorly here on Yelp.  I will say the garlic knots weren't too bad, but a little under-flavored and a little raw.  Granted - they comp'd us one of the ordered of knots - and it wasn't even the one on my bill!  Throughout, the service was horrible - long waits, poor communications, difficult to catch our server's attention - you all know that drill.  Very poor service, lack of quality, no communication, I will be crossing this Casanova's off my list for future visits.   Best to stick with Venezias for pizza."}
{"text":"Food was espetacular! We ordered two different types of pizza, bread and sauce sides... and we're not disappointed.
Customer service was top notch."}
{"text":"Pizza is my favorite food, and I really enjoyed this place. Ordered a 16\" thin crust cheese, delicious! Friendly service and good prices. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"After searching pizza in the area I came across this gem sitting at 4.5 stars with over 700 reviews. Highest in the area of Gilbert/Chandler area. I decided to give this place a try and upon entering I was greeted by the owner, Tony. With a firm handshake he asked me my name and I immediately felt I was family. I sat at the bar to order some lunch and a beer and met Nicole, his daughter, and ordered a brew. Not even a minute later Tony came from the kitchen with their famous garlic knots that I read ALL about on Yelp and was a second away from ordering. He gave them to me on the house and said \"Relax and make yourself at home.\" I eventually ordered a NY Special slice and white pizza slice. No words can describe the deliciousness that entered my mouth. I require anyone in the immediate area, or just here visiting, please visit this well oiled, spectacular establishment. You will not regret it, and will truly enjoy every minute here."}
{"text":"I came here based on the yelp reviews. I don't eat pizza often, but do enjoy it on occasion. The pizza was delicious and the staff was friendly. They give you free garlic knots on your first visit too! We had slices of  the cheese and the white pizza. Both were cooked perfectly. Excellent flavor and texture. Even though it's a little out of the way for us, my daughter and I will definitely be back the next time we're craving pizza!"}
{"text":"We've lived in Gilbert about six years and unfortunately I had no idea this restaurant was even here. What a gem! As soon as we walked in we were greeted by a jovial Tony behind the counter who also quickly introduced his brother saying, \"and over there's my brother Mikey!\" It is really reminded me of the eight years that I lived in New York. In my opinion you three things for a successful restaurant: good service, ambience, good food. The brothers immediately established the service end of that equation. The ambience was cool to as they were playing Sinatra and other big-band type music and adorned on the walls were pictures of famous New Yorkers and whatnot. The food didn't disappoint either as it  looked and tasted authentic New York. These guys get it about good service and that means a lot to me. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the valley, bar none! Having come from NY many years ago I can honestly say that all my efforts to find a genuine NY style pizza in the valley have finally been met for the first time. I've tried NYPD, Sal's Pizza and others, and while they were good they just didn't have it all like Cassonava Bros. The pizza was brought to the table hot, the bottom a perfect blend of soft and crusty, topped with delicious cheese and sauce. I had a regular slice and a Sicilian slice and both were wonderful. As I placed my order at the register, the cashier asked if I had been there before to which I replied no. She immediately introduced herself, extended her hand for a shake and shouted over to the owner who also welcomed me. I was also given 6 free garlic knots! I've never experienced such a warm reception at a restaurant before. Later one of the owners, Tony, served me and stopped to chat. Very nice guy. When I asked him why he hadn't opened more locations he said the most important ingredient is hiring the right people and he's not sure a second location could match what he has going at this one. He's right about that. His employees are all fast, efficient and very friendly. I'm ready for another visit....!"}
{"text":"Huge slices for the price, that's about the best I can say. The atmosphere was nice enough for a small place, however, since I ordered ahead for take out I am reviewing based on my food. Let's start with the garlic knots. After reading other reviews, I guess I was supposed to microwave them per instructions on the box? Mine came in a styrofoam container in a brown paper bag and I didn't know (no instructions for me), so to my disappointment, they were cold. Yuck! Now for the pizza, it was just okay. Thank goodness our stomachs were growling and neither one of us had breakfast! When asked if the new place was a thumbs up or down, my boyfriend replied, \"Meh, I've had better. But I've had worse too.\" The ham looked like cut up sandwhich ham that was bunched up across the pizza. Also, the crust was tough towards the outside and it was lacking in sauce. I was hoping for better based on the Yelp reviews and given our usual go to pizza place is no longer right down the street. I'll keep looking."}
{"text":"From the min you walk in and Tony introduces himself , shakes your hand and asks your names, and the smells of homemade simmering sauce hits your nose you're hooked. Got a Deluxe pizza and eggplant parm to share, thinking we'd have leftovers but nope, we could'nt stop eating. It was too good. Their house wines are great."}
{"text":"Great pizza and super friendly service. There is always an owner there and they make you feel like their most important customer and friend when they talk to you. I always get the Sicilian crust pizza. It us a little more money,  but it is worth it! Great sauce too!"}
{"text":"As soon as we walk in to pick up our order, we are greeted by one of the owners. When we explain that it's our first time ordering from Casanova Bros. he gets up to shake our hands, check to make sure our order is correct, and he added some garlic knots to our order for free. I have never felt so welcome in a restaurant. Even if the pizza was horrible, I would have gone back. Good news, the pizza was AMAZING!! I have been looking for New York style pizza and this was it. It was so good. I will absolutely be back and will recommended this pizza to anyone!!"}
{"text":"Tonight was out first visit and from the moment we walked in the door, Tony made us feel like family.  Tried a few different dishes including pizza, and honestly the flavor of the food here is completely fresh and alive.  My personal opinion, I love cheese and the Deluxe pizza could use more cheese, but I'll just order it that way next time.  I do know one thing for sure? I've found my new favorite spy to sit here in Gilbert, as evidenced in my picture. Will surely be back again."}
{"text":"We were driving by and were hungry. We drove by this pizza place and almost said no. We walked into Casanova Bros. Pizza. I can't tell you how wonderful of a place this is. Tony, Mike, Louie and Amanda were what made our experience great. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The place looked nice and the staff were friendly, but the food was bland.  I had the chicken Marsala that was $17 and it had no flavor.  My wife had the philly cheese steak sandwich and again, bland.  I must say though, the marinara sauce was good.  My kids ordered spaghetti and really enjoyed."}
{"text":"We feel like Tony and Mike are our family and they treat us like theirs.  They truly have the best pizza  around.  Great atmosphere and they know their customers names.  We go for pizza once a week!"}
{"text":"I need to come here more often! This place is awesome!

The owner is super friendly and remembers you by name. The food is reasonably priced and very tasty. We always get the garlic knots, which are little clouds of deliciousness served with marinara sauce for dipping.

On our most recent visit, I got the fettuccine Alfredo with chicken and my husband got the Philly cheesesteak. Both dishes were delicious, and really hit the spot when I was craving Italian food. We finished the meal with the zeppolis for dessert. They were fluffy and sweet. Perfect!"}
{"text":"Before we even ordered our food, my husband said, \"We're definitely coming back, just for the customer service!\" 

Tony, what can I say? You can tell this guy has a passionate love affair with his restaurant. We were immediately greeted by Tony with a handshake and asked for our names. I let him know this was our first time there & we heard about his restaurant on Yelp. He brought free Garlic Knots to our table and was extremely helpful at suggesting menu items.

The pizza was very good, he made sure to check on us a few times, and even sent us home with free dessert! 

You don't see an owner that passionate and that friendly anywhere these days. It seems like it's getting him far - that place was packed! 

We will be back for more!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this place! Tony was super friendly and welcoming and even gave us free garlic knots for our first time ordering food from them. The food was great, had tons of flavor and we really enjoyed our pizza and garlic knots. Thanks so much and keep up the good work!! We are super excited to try out the new location with the bigger restaurant. The owners work hard, long hours and have great customer service and even called us by name.... They deserve the success! Congrats!"}
{"text":"This pizzeria is no joke. Makes you feel like you belong and a wonderful atmosphere to go along with it."}
{"text":"We just discovered Casanova Bros. and it was so good and the staff was amazing. What's sad is we're moving out of the area. This would be our choice for a regular pizza place, for sure. We'll be back when we're in the area. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Pizza was very good but not the best I've had in Mesa. Wings were excellent.  Mozzarella sticks were cold and bland. Great prices."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! The staff is super nice. The pizza is sooo good and the garlic knots as well. And since it was our first time there we got free zeppolis for dessert!! Definitely going back!!"}
{"text":"Traditional New York style Italian. The Baked Ziti is phenomenal and the Sicilian pizza is on point! Nick is great and was extremely helpful in ordering. Don't miss this diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"Never a bad experience with Tony and his crew.  Best pizza in town, even the hard core New York wife says this pizza is competitive with anything she's had back East.  Good pizza, friendly staff, great place!"}
{"text":"First time here (just moved to Arizona TODAY) and a man named Tony greeted us by shaking our hands and asking each of our names. He then sat as at a table and brought us some complimentary garlic knots since it was our first time here. (They were delicious.) Looked at the front of the menu and saw that he must be one of the Cassanova bros. He was calling us by name and greeting others at the door also by their first names. Already impressed and by the time we were having our Cesar salad and pepperoni pizza, we pretty much decided we would be back once a week for the duration of our three month stay in Arizona. Magnificent service and delicious food. Just... yes."}
{"text":"Best Pizza around! Great quality and incredible service! Definitely a place I plan on bringing family and friends for future meals. I highly recommend the calzones and any of the pizzas. Subs are also outstanding! Have to meet uncle tony!"}
{"text":"Ok, I'm only writing this review because I hope the owners will take action to make their business run a little more smoother. I recently moved to Gilbert and decided to try this place. 1st time was awesome! Tasted similar to a Phoenix institution called Angie & Jimmie's. Look them up on the westside. AWESOME! Anyways, back to my review... 2nd time around, they forgot about our pizza and it ended up getting burned. They offered to replace it, but at that point we had waited too long and had to hurry up and eat to leave to finish running errands. Our wings were a little bit too cooked and ended up on the dry side, and they totally forgot about our garlic knots. At this point, I figured it was an honest mistake, maybe a bad day. 3rd time around, the pizza tasted as if we went to any other pizza place (borderline microwave pizza) AND to top that off we waited close to an hour for our pizza. We had to inquire about it TWICE! I can understand waiting that long for a fully packed joint, but this was on a Wednesday. The novelty of this place is now long gone and it will probably take me a few month to go back, if that."}
{"text":"I've only eaten here once, prior to moving to the actual \"restaurant\" location.  The prices are reasonable, food and service are good.  The portions are smaller than what you would expect at Buca di Beppo, but quality is about the same."}
{"text":"Casanova's is much more than an awesome pizza joint, it's an awesome experience. Tony and his staff go out of their way and go the extra mile to make every customer feel valued. When you come to Casanovas you feel as if you're coming home to your family in New York for dinner. The food is too notch and delicious. Thinking about going to another pizza place? Fuggetaboutit!"}
{"text":"Bomb.com lol. Service is I. 1st time here and was immediately greeted by the owner Tony!! What a nice, genuinely friendly guy. Food was incredible. Had the baked ziti, white pizza and Philly sandwich. Bam!!!! Sooooo good. Can't tell you how great the service is!!! Thank you Tony!!"}
{"text":"best customer service ever!! tony was absolutely amazing!! the food was absolutely delicious! Im so sad im just visiting i highly recommend everything here!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, I was so excited to try it.  Tony was great, garlic knots were great, but the pizza just wasn't so good.  We ordered the Hawaiian Delight.  The crust seemed like frozen pizza dough and the sauce was bland.  The food also took a really long time to arrive at the table.  We also had the caprese salad - hard to mess up, but the tomatoes weren't ripe and should have been thicker sliced.  Probably won't go back, but if I did - I'd try something else, like the pasta or entrees."}
{"text":"I tried their sausage and peppers calzone, mozzarella sticks, garlic knots, cannoli and chocolate mousse cake (yes all for one person lol). And it was all delicious! The calzone was amazing probably one of the best I've had in Arizona. It had a thick crust yet it's not heavy at all. The peppers have been sautéed and are tender, they don't just taste like raw peppers baked in a calzone and the sausage is so good! The mozzarella sticks were great the breading was flavorful but not too heavy and the cheese melted and stretched just how you would expect. The desserts were good, neither are my favorite type of dessert so I probably wouldn't order them again, but the mousse cake I will say was smooth and not gritty like some chocolate mousse you get. Both were really good quality. The cannoli stayed crispy even after having sat for a while which I was impressed with. The only thing I was less than impressed with were the garlic knots, they were a little bland for me, not very garlicky as the name would imply and the bread was just average, a little dry for me. I've had better at another pizzeria in Gilbert. But overall I will definitely be ordering from here again, I'm in love with that calzone and can't wait to try their pizza!"}
{"text":"Pizza was great! Service was excellent! One of the owners came out to greet me at my table and I received free garlic knots for my first visit.  I was told this place is good and I am in complete agreement. Will definitely come back and try a calzone and the lasagna.  Did I mention they have wings too?  Great value also!  Tho I never went to the old location this spot is fabulous!  Also try a canolli it was delish!"}
{"text":"We ordered pizza right around closing time for pick up because we saw it was rated best pizza in Arizona on Facebook. Crust wasn't crispy and both the pizza and garlic knots were warm at best. The marinara sauce that came with the knots was mediocre. I was disappointed. Descent tasting pizza, wouldn't make my top ten list of best in AZ though."}
{"text":"Disappointed. 
I have mixed feelings about this place. We came to the new larger location on a Saturday, which happened to be there 2nd day open. 
The staff seemed very unorganized, not trained and had no communication between other employees. 
They gave us free garlic knots, which were terrible. It was just a ball of cooked dough. They had no flavor. 
We ordered our food only to be told 5 minutes later that they were out of lasagna. For being your second day open & a Saturday, you should not be out of a main dish. 
We ended up just ordering a hot sandwich & slices of pizza. 
The slices of pizza came out way before the sandwich so needless to say we were almost done with our pizza before the sandwich even made it to the table. 
The pizza was good and with the lunch special pricing, I'd come back. 
The sandwich was just ok. I would not order again. 
The sum it all up.. I think they rushed the opening and staff were not properly trained."}
{"text":"Love their pizzas.  Best attempt at New York pizza that I've experienced in the East Valley thus far.  I haven't tried their other items, but the Margherita pizza is delish!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food and service. The young waiter was so adorable that I wanted to adopt him. Tiny was friendly and greeted us immediately. 

The alfredo sauce is to die for!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time tonight! Was greeted with a handshake and they give you garlic nots on the house for your first time! The food was amazing, best chicken parmesan I have had at any restaurant! Service was great, everyone was so welcoming. Me and boyfriend will definitely be coming back, thank you for the great experience and food:)"}
{"text":"I am giving it 3 stars because the manager or owner came around several time and was very nice. We even got an order of free garlic knots. We order fried zucchini and the slices were way to think and under cooked which was a disappointment. Maybe it's because I am a Jersey girl but I expected more for the reviews this place had. The sub was nothing compared to an east coast sub, very little meat and even less toppings. I tried a plain slice and the sauce tasted more like it was out of a jar. My husband enjoyed his white slice. Oh and the zeppoles, NO, just NO. I worked at the boardwalk growing up and a real pizza place, italians everywhere would die if they ate the fried pizza sought, so dense, no crunch, No just No!  Overall disappointed. If I want to get close to home I will have to go to Sal's. Sad because I really wanted to like his place."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this pizza place. I ordered a large pie with fresh garlic, bacon, onions and basil.  I also ordered 3 meatballs. 
When I got home I opened the pizza and all the toppings came from the jar!  So disappointed. I then unveiled the meatballs. 3 quarter size meatballs rolling around the tin, freshly defrosted.  WOW"}
{"text":"It's all about their WHITE SICILIAN PIZZA! These personable guys never forget a name and make you feel like you're part of the family. Casanova's service is top notch! Forget about their regular pizza I tell you...just try the WHITE SICILIAN with any topping"}
{"text":"The pizza was Great! Friendly manager and had a great server. Pizza was delicious! Definitely will be back again"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant.  Every time I walk in the door \"Tony & Mike\" make you feel like family.  I have never been to a restaurant with more friendly owners than this.  Always had awesome NY style food.  Garlic knots they give as appetizers are always fresh, pizza is high quality, & cannolis are great for desert.  Over all experience is always great at this place.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"(Lyrics - The Clash - Rock the Casbah)

Now Bo Bites told the pizza man
You have to let that sauce pop!
The NY pizza comes desert's way
Has been shaking to the top
The bros they drove they're Cadillac
They went a cruisnin down Gilbert
The Yelpers was a chilling
On the website they review

You gotta love Tony!  

Tony is one of the owners of this mom/pop pizza joint.  His enthusiasm and customer relations is by far one of the best in town!  He makes you feel at home and enjoys chatting it up making sure your experience at Casanova Bros. Pizza special.  

We started out dining experience off with some Mozzarella sticks and fried zucchini; while Tony offered us some free garlic knots for first timers!  First thing I notice was the marinara was pretty solid; nice subtle tomatoey sweetness.  It also came along with our mozzarella sticks, which was breaded with a light coat of breadcrumbs and oozing with soft mozzarella cheese.  Our fried zucchinis were perfect to the crunch and came with a ranch sauce.  For our pizza I went for the NY Special, which came with ham, pepperoni, sausage, and meatballs.  Overall a darn good pizza!  The crust had a solid crunch base while the dough was kept soft to the bite.  

In the end, Casanova Bros. Pizza is my new favorite pizza spot on the East side of town.  The place was bustling with patrons and for good reason.  The pizza here is phenomenal! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Casanova Brothers Pizza is the real deal. Hands down the best pizza in the East Valley. Run, don't walk..."}
{"text":"Not only is this place delicious, but the service is top notch! I am literally sitting in a booth with my family as I type this because we have all said multiple times how great the service is and how unbelievably delicious the food is. I don't generally review places, but felt compelled to as it has far exceeded our expectations!!"}
{"text":"This place is excellent. Lots of personality, the food is excellent. I went with a couple friends, the guy at the front asks everyone's name and if your new they will give you s complimentary order of garlic knots. I had the Sicilian  slice with extra cheese and a chicken parmigiano hero and one of my guests had a calzone  the other an eggplant parmigiano hero. All food was excellent and we will be going back. I would have given it 5 stars but it took s little long to get our food, but it was Saturday night and it was busy. Next time I go I will do an update on speed of service, I'm sure the food will still be great."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to us by  a friend recently and, since I just moved to the east valley, I was more than happy to oblige.

The SECOND we walked in Tony (one of the owners) greeted us.  He repeated our names 2-3 times to commit them to memory, promptly filled a basket with fresh, warm, and FREE garlic knots, and told us all about the lunch specials and the menu.

It felt like we walked right into NYC.  Seriously.

The entire staff was friendly, the other patrons were very smiley and welcoming (although we knew none of them).  The pizza was DELICIOUS and hot - foldable slices in true NY fashion.

It's hard to believe there is a New York pizzeria (by the SLICE at that!) in the east valley... but Tony and his brother? sure do do it right.

Can't wait to get fat going back time and again."}
{"text":"Best service in town! As soon as we walked in the owner greeted us, shook our hands and asked for our names. He checked on every table and called everyone by name. He checked in on us multiple times throughout the night. Food was absolutely delicious we got pizza and pasta and salad. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Had a  awesome experience here this evening. After finding this place on yelp, I was not let down! Food and service from Jackie were outstanding. And sure enough, the Owner, Tony was there to meet and greet all guests with a handshake as they walked thru the door. Love this place and will be returning!"}
{"text":"My husband and I come here every year on the anniversary of our first date.  Tony is always so welcoming and makes you feel like family.  It was exceptionally busy this year, but he still made it a point to come by, shake our hands, and say hello.  The service here is top notch, but of course that delicious pizza is the best part.  Perfectly thin and crispy (yet somehow still chewy) crust, yummy sauce, greasy but not too greasy...soooooo good."}
{"text":"I can't say anything that has not been said already, as I rub my full belly and reflect on the best meal I have had in forever. These guys do not disappoint. We felt like family. Everyone was amazing. Tony walks around to all the tables, chatting up the guests and delivering fresh free garlic knots. All I can think about is what I want to try next. Tonight, it was white pizza, to die for! Spaghetti with homemade meatballs, salad with homemade Italian dressing, crispy on the outside, creamy on the inside fat crinkle fries, and enough garlic knots to level a small village. This is our new place. I can't remember the last time I've felt so satisfied."}
{"text":"As soon as I walked in, I had AMAZING service. Really have the feel like I'm in New York. I love the fact that they sell by the slice ALL DAY. Most places only have that during lunch time. Great food, great environment. I will definitely be coming back for more. 

-Fro-"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the pizza here.  The owner was very polite and gave my date and I a free order of garlic knots since it was our first time there."}
{"text":"Who says service can't make or break your experience? Tony has his heart and soul in the restaurant and it was a wonderful. This place is a true hole-in-the-wall with a causal vibe and the food is authentic and amazing!  We even received garlic knots on the house! Tried the house salad, slice of white pizza, fettuccine alfredo and chicken wings. Nothing negative to say about any of the food, finger lickin' good :)"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza place! Tony is super friendly and tried to memorize everyone's names that visits. Pizza is excellent NY style. Bonus for first timers is he seems to give everyone that's there for the first time a free order of garlic knots (he did so for us and 3 other people who came in and said it was their first time as well). Highly recommended if you happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"I'm giving the Casanova Brothers a 5 star, my first ever meal was take out pizza, fries and garlic knots. I met 2 of the owners at the counter, very friendly people, very nice place. I was even given an extra order of garlic knots for being a first timer! Was taught how to spot fake money(I asked as he was checking my cash) pizza was outstanding! Fries were great, and garlic knots were simply delish!
Great people and great food. I will certainly eat here again. Thank you Casanova Brothers!"}
{"text":"Excellent. A touch of NY in AZ. The meat balls are terrrrific! Tony is more than hospitable, truly appreciates his patrons. I'll be back with friends and family. Keep them yummy pies a comin!!!"}
{"text":"Even though this place is a little far from my house to go to for pizza, this is now my new 'go to' place for a Sicilian Pizza. (Because the Sicilian is the only pizza I've tried so far) Sooo yummy!!!  I went away so very impressed with their very personable customer service. You just don't find family run places like this anymore. (Or any business, for that matter!) Great find!"}
{"text":"I like garlic but garlic knots were so heavy on garlic that they were hot.   Owners and staff were fabulous but pizza was just average.   Most likely won't be going back."}
{"text":"So everything everybody else says is true. You get free bread for being a first timer, and some little dessert bread as well. Pizza is AMAZING!!! I love thick pizza, and the Sicilian was exactly that! We also got the chicken Alfredo pasta. It was good but I would recommend sticking to pizza, it's waaaay yummier. The price is really what you make it. Slice of pizza is about $3 (two Sicilian slices is waaay more than enough food), but if you get pasta it's about $14.
Definitely coming here again and bringing my family."}
{"text":"Let me start with saying that good authentic regional Italian food that is non chain is hard to find here in Az. Let alone very personable genuine customer service.  That's what you get at Casanova brothers.  The food is great 1st time there and my girlfriend and I got complimentary garlic rolls. We didn't get the pizza, but I can only imagine how good it is. The chicken parm and the meat ravioli were just great, and the sauce alone is crazy good. The decor is awesome NY style and Tony one the owners really knows how to make you feel at home and adds to a true New York Italian dining experience.  Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time from a friends recommendation.
Tony from NY greeted us and right away I knew I was in a real pizza joint:) 
Pizza was perfect old school NY slice!
I finally found a true pizza pie place without having to fly to the big apple:)
They got me as a regular for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Most friendly owners and staff. Great pizza. Support your local neighborhood business!"}
{"text":"I have never seen owners of a pizza place so passionate about their job, they are so nice! Tony makes sure his customers are doing fine all the time, me and my sister wanted ranch with our food and out of no where tony pops out and brings us ranch without even asking him lol! The cannoli I tried there is one of best ever! Not to mention if it's your first time there you get free tasty garlic knots! Go try it, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"This was our first time in, and Tony made us feel like family. If Mama wasn't in a \"better place\", she'd probably come out of the kitchen and give everyone a kiss!

The pizza was legit NY-style, it brought back memories of growing up on the east coast, especially with Tony chatting with us before it got busy.  Compared to the others in the area, the flavor is better than NYPD Pizza and the consistency is more authentic than Venezia's with better red sauce. We tried both the regular and the white pizza, and both were delicious and I will be back. We want to try some of the subs, too!

Oh and a true testament to the NY-style authenticity is that it was delicious cold the next day for lunch."}
{"text":"I have had the pleasure of dining at Casanova Brothers on several occasions and find the customer service equals that of or even exceeds the level of many four and five star restaurants I have been to in either Chicago or Phoenix.  They don't treat you like a \"regular\" customer, but as one of the family.

As for the pizza, the crust has the right consistency and texture.  There is a hint of garlic but it really balances everything out.  My favorite is their white cheese pizza with spinach.  Huge slices and a very balanced flavor.  Those comments are not easy to come by from me as I am a pizza \"snob\" originally from Chicago.  I even told Tony that this is the BEST NY pizza I have ever eaten...PERIOD!  

I have also had pasta and other dishes there and they have a very nice taste as well.  I am not afraid to recommend this place and even tell those I send to let Tony know I sent them."}
{"text":"We have always love this place for takeout but are now more in love with their full restaurant!
The food is fantastic (esp. chicken parm and Sicilian pizza) but the people make this place a cut above."}
{"text":"Having grown up with a mother who is from Chicago, I have had some delicious pizza in my lifetime but never did I experience pizza in the way that the Cassanova Brothers do it.

I had just graduated block 2 of nursing school, which if you're not a nursing student you don't realize how big of a need there is to celebrate, so my entire family and significant other headed over to Cassanova Brothers Pizza. 

The owner greeted me warmly, introduced himself, shook my hand and even repeated mine and my boyfriends name so that he could remember it...little did I realize I had just met my favorite New Yorker.

After eating, the owner came back, personally delivered a to-go box, called us all by name as if we were family, and congratulated me and told me that he felt honored to be a part of such a celebration. Dessert was on the house seeing as he was 'proud of me'.

I will becoming back here again, and again. The service made this a memorable experience but the food is remarkable...I adore Italian food so I can be a hard critic, but I had nothing but raving reviews for everything that I ate that evening.

Thank you for such a wonderful experience and for all the delicious food you make, keep up the good work...I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Really great food and service they always remember your name! Very clean place too definitely one of the few amazing places to eat in Mesa! 

Update 2/11/17
All I can say is wow! They moved but are in the same parking lot just look for the new huge building and when you walk inside it's beautiful. The bar is awesome I was getting pizza to go and was so drawn in I stayed and had a blue moon and ate there. Stop in and check it out!"}
{"text":"I'm pleased to be updating this review. FINALLY!  Good Pizza and BEER under one roof!

Nice new digs. A little fancy even for pizza and pasta, but nobody is going to criticize the owners for cutting corners or sparing expenses. It's a very nice large dining room.  Columns. Nice trimmings. Classy. Comfortable. Not loud. Not overly crowded. 

Food?  Delicious as always. Amazing Sicilian pizza. Amazing NY style pizza. None of the food here is sub-par. It's a rare treat to get great tasting \"back east\" style Italian food in AZ. 

The downside?

Service?  A little slow. They said it would be an hour for the Sicilian pizza. Forty minutes for the Pizza Blanco. It was forty five for both. A little long if you ask me. You gotta find a way to get it under 30 minutes guys. 

Wait staff?  Not great. Not terrible. A little young and inexperienced. Definitely out of place with the elegance and the image projected by the new restaurant. 

Prices?  Just a little on the high side, but not too far out of reason.  $82 for two pizzas, a plate of pasta, three beers, two appetizers and a couple of soft drinks.  Fed six and a half people with some to take home. Guess I can't complain about that. 

Five stars if you improve serving time. I'll be back in about a month.  ;-). I wanna give you five!"}
{"text":"Really good pizza and really good customer service! Where else do the owners make it a point to greet their customers and shake their hands? It make a big difference and they know it. I've eaten here every time I'm in Arizona."}
{"text":"Great individual dinner choices and a favorite pizza place for us. Friendliest owner and staff you'll ever find. Service is as good as the food!  I like that the pasta dishes come in small and large sizes. I also enjoy the music here. It's 40's and 50's and not too loud. Good place for a date night or large group gathering. They have a bar too."}
{"text":"Definately our favorite pizza place in Gilbert! My husband was born and raised in Long Island, NY and we are both Italian. The first thing we did when we moved here was hunt and ask around for a great pizza place and Casanova Brothers came recommended. Love their pizza and we are looking forward to trying their dinners!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! 

We ordered: 
Pepperoni mushrooms olives pineapple pizza.
Awesome!
Garlic knots 
Awesome!
Mozzarella sticks
Awesome!
Antipasto salad
Awesome!

I really enjoyed my visit here. This was my 2nd time here. They brought knots out since it was our friends first time coming in. We enjoyed a delicious meal and friendly staff. At the end of our meal the owner came out with a container full of garlic knots! Yes please elevensies! (Lord of the rings)... 

Anyway, this place is definitely worth a stop. Next time we come in I will have to try the deep dish \"Sicilian\" or the pasta.... Or the meatball sub... Or the right side of the menu."}
{"text":"Best pizza we have found yet in the valey (haven't tried the thick crust yet).  The garlic knots are wonderful.  The philly cheese steak is quite good.  The owners are a great bunch, nice as could be,  go once & they know your name from then on, a nice touch."}
{"text":"Killer pizza!  If you are from the East Coast than it should be mandatory for you to eat here once a week!

Outstanding garlic knots!"}
{"text":"So delicious!! We are from ct so used yelp to help us find some good local food for take out. Pizza was excellent and their chief salad even impressed me with chopped roasted red peppers and meat rolls. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I've heard all the hype about this place overs the years by Brady Bogan on KUPD's Holmberg's Morning Sickness. Anyways, I finally got a chance to grab a couple slices last Friday. 

Let's start off with the staff and restaurant itself. I called in my order to get it started before I arrived. Once I got there, the 2 ladies upfront gave me a very welcoming greeting and were quick to help with my order. I enjoyed the friendly staff, makes you feel at ease there. The restaurant was very clean and fancy looking. I liked all the old photos.

Onto my order...........
I called in a order for a calzone with pepperoni and sausage and a slice of pizza for a co-worker. When I got there (a few minutes after I called in my order). I was told the calzone would take 25-30 minutes to cook, so I cancelled it and just order a couple slices of pepperoni and sausage. So with all the hype, I was expecting it to be delicious. But, was an epic fail and complete let down. For what they charge, I expect it to be delicious and flavorful. It was just okay.

Anyways, I might give it another shot with the calzone I didn't get. Brady let me down."}
{"text":"This is where you come for real NY style pizza.  The owners, Mike and Tony, are brothers from NY. They originally opened their restaurant twenty years ago in the same shopping plaza they are currently in.  Over the years, word got around about their great food and personal service and they outgrew the size of the place.  Last year, they moved into a space more than twice the size of the previous location.  It has two separate dining areas as well as two rooms that can be reserved for private parties,  school class outings, or sport team parties. Their prices are very reasonable and they serve wine, spirits, a nice selection of draft beer,  and fountain drinks.  The table service is great.  Mike and Tony also make an effort to greet and ask they name of their guests when they arrive which you will find no where else!  I wouldn't be surprised if their mom told them they should do this a long time ago and these two NY boys said,  \"Yes, Mom.\"  If you want great food, great service, at a great value,  you go to Casanova Brothers Pizza."}
{"text":"Last Friday night we took the kids out to dinner. We drove around Gilbert trying to find a place and every single restaurant was packed with long wait times. We ended up in the plaza this place is located at hoping to eat at Serrano's, but again they were super crowded. We saw this place with no wait time and decided to give it a try. When we walked it we were greeted by a really friendly gentleman. As we walked up to the counter he asked if we've ever eaten there and shook our hands as he introduced himself. He brought us over a basket of their garlic knots on the house and they were amazing! Super fresh and delicious. The sauce was just as great. We ordered a large pizza, buffalo wings and fries. The pizza was one of the best I've ever had. The dough was light and thin, like NY style. The sauce tasted fresh with a great flavor. And my husband and I absolutely loved their buffalo sauce. It was tangy with the perfect amount of spice. The nice gentleman checked on us a few more times and even bought us some fresh garlic knots to take home. On the house of course! This is our new favorite pizza joint. Who does that?!?! We felt so welcomed there and our kids loved it too! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch last week, and I was so pleasantly surprised at the high level of customer service I received. It was my first time trying Casanova Bros, so the owner gave me a brief explanation of the menu and some possible options to try. He introduced himself and shook my hand. The garlic knots were delicious, and my slice of pizza was hot and delicious. This place has superb customer service and great food."}
{"text":"I have to say that what makes this place memorable to me is the owner Tony... he is a crack up whether intentionally or not and very friendly.  The pizzas are huge and quite good."}
{"text":"Ate there last night for the first time and the owner Nick seems to be a good guy. The servers were helpful and knowledgeable and the fettuccine alfredo was excellent. I added the shrimp and it was good. We look forward to going back. Also, I should add that the prices were more than reasonable."}
{"text":"A more classy, authentic, friendly pizzeria you're not gonna find anywhere else! Tony made us feel like part of the family and wanted to know our names and gave us his recommendations (white pizza) and didn't dissapoint! Everything is well prepared and delicious. It's just a great atmosphere! I definately will be recommending this place to my friends and family!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried Casanova Bros. the other night for dinner, and we were so impressed! We are new to the area, and picked this place based on the great reviews. We went to pick up our order, and as soon as we arrived, the owner greeted us with a warm welcome. He asked if we had been there before, and after telling him we just moved here, he welcomed us to the \"family\", and even gave us some of their garlic knots for free. On the way home, we talked about how we want to bring our families there when they visit, before we even tried the food! We were just so blown away by the exceptional customer service. All of the food was amazing, too. We enjoyed a new york style pizza, along with wings and garlic knots. All around, a fantastic family-owned business, and we can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Old time favorite for us.  Only suggestion would be is getting gluten free pizza !! Please !!!"}
{"text":"Super friendly and inviting staff! Free garlic knots on our first visit! You can tell this family puts a lot of effort into making the customer's experience the best! I love the family owned small business feel. We will be coming back to enjoy the delicious food. Great place, eat here!"}
{"text":"All the reviews are true. Great pizzas but what was most impressive was the friendly service. The owner is just a great guy. Check this place out ."}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews but we went to Casanova brothers for the first time for my dad's birthday and had an amazing experience customer service is incredible and the food was delicious will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"First timer and will return. The garlic knots were phenomenal. We also had the wings and thin crust deluxe pizza. Very tasty and glad we stopped in for dinner. Service was spot on and closed with an awesome dessert!"}
{"text":"Coming from a pizza snob, this place is awesome! The crust is thin and crispy and the toppings are fresh. Not to mention the service is incredible. Told the guy at the register, who I think is the owner, that it was my first time and he brought us some garlic knots on the house and remembered mine and my husbands name. I love supporting good family owned restaurants and this is definitely one to go to!"}
{"text":"New location is beautiful inside, and the pizza is still awesome. I wanted to stay longer but I had to go to work. I can't wait to go back and check out the bar, and other items on their menu."}
{"text":"Had our first experience with Casanova's on Sunday night and I was beyond impressed. I lived in NYC for 6 years and have turned in to some what of a pizza snob, always on the hunt for a pizza spot similar to ones in NYC. I finally found it! From their menu and toppings, to the experience at pick-up and then the actual pie itself, everything was excellent and of superior quality.

When I picked up the pie the woman behind the counter asked me if I was a new customer, she then shouted to the kitchen, using my name, that I was new and everyone cheered saying \"hi/welcome Tiffany\". She then offered me an order of free garlic knots to try as a first time customer. It definitely set the tone for what then was the best pizza I have found in Arizona, and quite frankly outside of NYC.

This is a must try and is now the only pizza place I will be ordering from."}
{"text":"This place was wonderful!  Food was really great.  These guys should teach classes on customer service.  They try as hard as they can to make sure you have a wonderful experience.  We'll definitely go back soon!"}
{"text":"Another Yelper wrote that Casanova Brothers had legit Bronx pizza, so I had to try it before going on the Keto Diet.  Afterall, I'm from NY.

When I opened the door, I heard music from Goodfellas.  I then saw a wall of pics from the Godfather.  I immediately felt at home.

Tony introduced himself to my family and shook my hand.  My wife said he talks like me, but I don't hear other NYer accents.  

The garlic knots were soft and tasty.  The fried zucchini was great.  We got a Deluxe Pizza.  I was expecting a traditional greasy pizza but that is not what we got.  It was very good though.  For dessert, we got cannoli's.  There are also not the traditional ones I remember but also very tasty."}
{"text":"This is the best New York style pizza I've found in the Valley.  The crust is thin and chewy, the toppings are authentic and the flavor from the cheese and sauce put me right in the middle of Manhattan.  The garlic knots are delicious with real garlic, parsley and maranara dipping sauce.

Tony and crew are friendly, fun and remember your name and favorites once you've been in a few times.  The kitchen staff is also courteous and helpful when they assist with delivering orders on a busy night.

The only improvement I could see is if they carry good beer.  Nothing goes with pizza like a good beer!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. Best pizza in the valley hands down. The hospitality is by far the best you can't beat it. I highly recommend coming here. They treat you like family. And the fettuccine Alfredo is amazing also."}
{"text":"My family and I came because I saw that this was the best pizza in AZ according to Yelpers. Pizza was five stars. I tasted both the regular and Sicilian variations. The crust is really well done for both styles but I like the regular/thin crust better. The sauce and cheese mesh well with the toppings and the crust. The cheese sticks are awesome and the garlic knots are decent. Only reason I didn't rate a five is because they forgot to give us our garlic knots, side of ranch dressing, and the plates, we had to ask for that stuff. I'll come back though."}
{"text":"The real deal. Delicious authentic NY style crust Pizza. Great friendly service, Tony makes you feel like your old friends."}
{"text":"Best pizza, pasta, and subs in town!  Mike, Tony, and Luigi know how to run a pizza joint.  I have been going to this place for years and have always had great food and top notch customer service.  They ask your name and every time you come in they remember it.  Who does that?  No one!  So the pizza is NY style and fantastic but be sure to try the Eggplant Parm Sub and the Ziti if you can stray from the pizza... I know it is hard but well worth it.  This place is such a asset to Gilbert and worth the drive if you do not live close by."}
{"text":"Ordered Sicilian pizza to go to accommodate my pregnancy cravings tonight. From the moment I walked in everyone was so friendly asking me about my due date and even giving me some baby name suggestions while I waited on my pizza. Since it was my first time coming here they even rushed out some garlic knots to go with it for free. Everything came out fast and they even brought it out to my car for me. Great people and great customer service. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Sorry...not a fan of this place. Went here with my family of four on a whim, the reviews were decent. I got a Philly sandwich which was the most bland flavorless luke warm sandwich I have ever had. It was not good, the peppers and onions were cooked until they were mush, no flavor. The steak was bland and dry, I didn't even finish it, it was that bad. My kids opted for a pasta plate of spaghetti and meatballs, they were decent, the kids liked it. My husband got some chicken marsala dinner, which was nothing more than dried up chicken with canned mushrooms on top. The juices in the chicken marsala were watery and just unappetizing to look at. The serve was meh, we had three different people serve us. Some one took our order, another brought our drinks, then the last one brought our food. Never did any of these three servers refill our drinks, ask if everything was as expected, or offered any extension of service. I was highly disappointed, as this is a moderately priced eatery. The inside decor is nice in a cheesy opulent way, but not impressed to spend my money here again. My husband and I sincerely love to support local business but unfortunately this is not a repeat for us."}
{"text":"Amazing Pizza and Calzone also very nice ambiance and the owners and staff are so friendly. We can't wait to go back 
I would recommend the sausage and pepper calzone and the half meat half white pizza with sausage and spinach."}
{"text":"The staff is amazing. The food is uh-mazing!! Everything is hot and freshly made, so be prepared for a little wait, but it is so worth it! Their cannolis are to die for, I literally lick the plate (I have no shame). I recommended this place to a friend a few months ago and they are still thanking me for it  I've only had pizza there but my friend loves their sandwiches. It's just a place you have to go to and eat. Great atmosphere, they treat you like family. Delicious!!"}
{"text":"Tony and ...I forgot the other brother's name are great very welcoming and will remember anyone that comes in. If you have never been into this New York style pizza joint they will be happy to give you a run down of all types of food they create and what would fit best to your liking. However My fiancé and I personally feel their pizza is overpriced for the quality. I don't know if it's us not being familiar with New York style pizza but We don't see our selfs coming here when we need to get our pizza fix. Other then that their desserts and appetizers are very good. This is definitely a place to check out."}
{"text":"These guys run a great shop. If you're into the New York / New Jersey style of pizza, salads, knots, etc. then this place is worth a try. The family that owns the place are good people, and make everyone welcome. The service is excellent. The food isn't cheap, but I think the service is worth it."}
{"text":"Everything was fantastic! From the service to the food. we didn't try the pizza this time just the pasta. The pasta was actually great! I will 100% return and get a pizza next time! My 1 1/2 year old son devoured the fettuccini and meat ravioli!! He literally would not stop eating it  the owner was on top of everything and seemed very outgoing and friendly!"}
{"text":"Truly impressive Tony is the best at making you feel like your one of the family.  The food is truly New York my family goes back to 1864 in Brooklyn,  my great-grandfather was the owner of Staubits market on Cobb Hill in Brooklyn Martin Lang.  Thank you for letting us have dinner with you Tony"}
{"text":"Garlic knots? More like cold undercooked garlic NOTS! Vegetable toppings on pizza I'm pretty sure came from a can. Nothing like real NY pizza. Overpriced"}
{"text":"First time here. As others said, they are very friendly and asked the names of everyone in your party when we ordered. Throughout the visit, we were addressed by our names, even the kids.

The garlic knots are a favorite in my family -- the others have been here several times over the past few years, and I enjoyed the pizza. Based on the other reviews and pictures here, I'll have to go back and try the calzone and white pizza... And desserts. 

Nice people and great service. So far, the food was good, too. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Best Italian place ever! You walk in and you become family to them. These guys run amazing place. Best food I've had in a while, and Will defiantly be coming back. You walk in and they ask or know your name. They talk to you and treat you like family. I had their Alfredo and it was some of the best I've ever had. And their garlic knots and dessert rolls are to die for!"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal for pizza....great crust, sauce with just a bit of a kick, and gobs of fresh toppings.....and talk to Tony when you get there... He'll make you feel like family. Always go to the local pizza parlor.... It's the best!"}
{"text":"Was treated with great respect as I enter and was given a free order of garlic knots"}
{"text":"One of the most important things for us Italians is family, and Tony the owner made us feel more than that. Besides  Tony's great hospitality the food truly reflects an authentic Italian cuisine everything is made fresh with their own recipe! My girlfriend had the eggplant parm while I had the meatball sub both were delicious didn't have to add anything to it. I promise you that you won't regret stopping by casanovas, in fact you might question yourself as to why you never stopped their before we'll be back"}
{"text":"Originally from NY - I have been looking for a good place for nearly 20 years.  This is some of the best NY pizza I have ever had in AZ.  You know its good when you fold it in half and the orange oil drips off the tip.  yyuummmm....pizza heaven.  I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Best freakin' cuts in the State.  These guys are old school, I mean, come on. And the Chicken Parm... outta this world!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Pizza is always fresh and just like New York. I live far away so I am only able to come in around once every couple months, but the owner still seems to remember me every time I am in there and greets me by name! All the guys are super friendly. Would recommend this place to anyone that wants some real New York pizza."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best pizza I've had outside of New York city. I will say we have been here a few times now and the pizza is best when made by the heavyset guy who is always consistently there on Fridays and Saturdays.

Ask for the pie thin without a ton of crust. Always comes out perfect.

Skip the garlic knots as they have never been fresh and are really not very good. If you want good Garlic knots that are light and buttery only Gilbert Pizza has them in this town. But the pizza is better at Casanova."}
{"text":"Found the Restuarant on yelp, we have \"No Complaints\", great food!!! Service was fantastic, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood joint. Love the owners. They're so nice and they always remember your name. They moved to a new spot in the same plaza which is more spacious but I miss the feel of the old place. Either way as long as the good tastes the same I'm ok with it"}
{"text":"Great service yummy pizza and wings! We will definitely be back to try the pasta. It's nice to have a great pizza spot so close to home. Welcome to the neighborhood Casanova Bros!"}
{"text":"Love this pizza restaurant. It is the closest to NY style pizza I can find. The staff are so friendly and it is very evident that Tony and Mike really care about their customers. My favorite is the NY special but I add pineapple and banana peppers to it."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. The service is wonderful! My dad brought me a slice and I ate it cold and it was so good I had to check it out. Ended up doing an office team builder in one of their private room. My whole team loved it! My favs were the white pizza and the veggie pizza. They also have a bar. The prices were reasonable. I've been back a few times now and it's always excellent!"}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to try somewhere new tonight and decided to google Italian food this place had great reviews so we decided to give it a try. They gave us complementary garlic knots for it being our first time and the owner came over and introduced himself within minutes of sitting down. The prices were very reasonable and the food was delicious!! We were both very impressed and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Hubby took me here a couple weeks ago, must say pretty good pizza!

We had to wait for about 45 mins for the pizza but it was worth the wait! And I can understand why it took so long, they had so many customers. Mostly regulars but I totally understand why they all keep coming back. The staff is very friendly and makes you feel like your part of the family! 

Garlic knots are good especially with cheese, if you want quicker service call in your order before coming in and pick it up! No wait and you can enjoy your pizza in the comfort of your own home!"}
{"text":"The service here is VERY slow. The pizza is VERY average. Not sure how it is ranked so high. My group had a few different pizzas. The BBQ pizza tasted like your basic walmart bbq sauce. The Sicilian was like something from walmart. Pretty disappointing. Better options in town."}
{"text":"Went for the first time.  Greater very promptly and friendly by who I assume is the owner.  Great food, but just mediocre if not bad service.  The calzone was the best part.  May be back for takeout."}
{"text":"Tried something new at a favorite pizza place.  The wings were awesome.  Nicely done with some extra sauce on the side for a little zing.  Had a pepperoni calzone too. It was great.  We usually have the deluxe pizza but wanted to branch out."}
{"text":"I am a West coast girl that has never been to New york.  When I walked in to this place, it's how I imagined a New York pizza joint's atmosphere would be.  The friendly welcome, the new york accent, and hurried pace, all reminiscent of  all the things I heard of the new york experience.  I didn't mind I knew what I wanted.

The Pizza:  Is legit, crispy and thin, yummy sauce, one of the best I tasted.  This place is a local gem in Gilbert, AZ. 

Interesting fact:  Do you know the song \"if I was a boy\" was inspired by pizza.  Beyonce and her producer were walking down time square.  Beyonce said, \"That pizza smells really good, and I'm trying not to eat carbs, and I wish I were a boy so I didn't care.\" That's how the song started."}
{"text":"Awesome! That's all I have to say. I've been searching for a homemade eggplant parmigiana and I've found it. Cannolis are AH-mazing. My kids loved the bread, pizza and wings (no sauce). Tony's friendliness is just the icing on the cake. Homey feel, welcome every single person as they walk through.  Can't wait until I'm not full so I can come back."}
{"text":"Got exactly what we expected, great service and tasty food. Fully recommend and will definitely be here again!"}
{"text":"Ordered from Casanova Bros' today for myself and a bunch of people at work. We had a large order, and they completed everything within the time originally quoted to me, which was great! When I arrived, the owners were quick and friendly even though they were pretty busy. They introduced themselves and everything. They double checked the orders, and even threw in a free garlic knot appetizer for our first time. 

The food itself was incredible, and the prices were low. For $10, I got a huge portion of manicotti (delicious by the way), a good-sized house salad, and warm bread and butter to eat with the meal. I couldn't even finish it all! My coworkers were also very impressed with their meals. They each got a \"small\" size ordered off the online menu, and it was definitely enough food for them. 

5/5 for these guys, we will for sure be ordering from them again in the future."}
{"text":"Love this place. Their pizza is good and their service is great. The owner personally shakes his customer's hands and seems to know many of them by name. Awesome place and experience."}
{"text":"We tried this for the first time today because of all the great Yelp reviews. They did not disapoint! The manager on duty was super friendly and very helpful. We settled on lunch specials for the girls... 2 slices of cheese pizzas and it was really good! My dh had the chicken parmigan entree also very good. I had the cheese calzone. It was awesome! They put ricotta cheese and mozarella inside with the sauce on the side. I do not like ricotta cheese but the brand they used was yummy and mixed with the mozarella it was perfect. I'm used to calzones with all mozarella which is also good but the ricotta made the dish not too heavy. I ate the whole thing. I can never eat a whole calzone. I don't know if its because the ricotta made it lighter or because it was so yummy I couldn't stop, haha probably both. They also gave us complimentary garlic knots since it was our first time. It was very good but I agree with another reviewer...next time I will ask them to heat it in the oven instead of the microwave."}
{"text":"Very inviting place hidden in a normal plaza. The people who work here are so kind and friendly. So.. The food. The food was amazing! We had a variety of things pizza,  pasta, wings, garlic knots. It was all so good. My husband is picky about wings and he loved them! It tastes fresh, savory and nothing like fast food. Yum,  will be eating here often!!"}
{"text":"The new location is beautiful, but with expansion comes growing pains. Our order was wrong, garlic knots burnt, water not refilled, and we were over charged. I miss being greeted by name and seeing our pizza chef."}
{"text":"This has been our Friday night 'go to' place for a long time now.  The pizza is amazing!  According to my husband, \"this is the pizza we will eat in heaven\".  The staff is friendly and we have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"We read the reviews & had to try it. The wife & I stopped in last night & were glad we did. The garlic knots are very good. Ordered  a large NY special & more garlic knots. Very tasty last night & it was delicious warmed up."}
{"text":"Tony and his team are amazing! He made it a point to know everyone's names who came his way and checked on us through the meal. Amazing service, the best we've had anywhere in years! The food was great and he knew us all by name as we left and personalized the experience. He also gave the kids some fried dough balls they had for desert for free as we left, great guy and I would recommend this place to anyone any day of the week!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Today was the first visit for us. We walked in and were warmly welcomed by everyone. Tony the owner came over and thanked us for coming. The service was wonderful. Then came the food! First free garlic knots then delicious pizza and wings. We found our pizza place!"}
{"text":"Maybe it was just a bad day as far as the service goes but the food, let's just say mediocre is generous.
We went at lunchtime on a Sunday.  Not too busy as we went in but we still waited 45 minutes for cheese ravioli and spaghetti.  It only came out after I complained.  I was told there was one chef and they were very busy.  It does not take a chef to cook restaurant supply store pasta and sauce.  Not to mention that people who came in a good 20 minutes after us had gotten their food.  Someone forgot about our order!  It came out cold about 2 minutes later.  
I say go to Spinato's or Salerno's if you want good Italian food in the east valley."}
{"text":"Wow!! This was some of the best baked ziti I have ever had!!! Their garlic knots were mouthwatering! Nicole was so friendly, greeted us each time she talked to us by name and gave us an incredible experience here!!! It is such exceptionally good food that I will drive from Tempe to come eat here again!!"}
{"text":"The food here is ok. I was not as thrilled as most people on their reviews. 

I will give them one more shot, maybe I didn't order the best menu item."}
{"text":"All of the food is delicious. A gentlemen named Tony (the manager I believe) shook my hand and introduced himself as I picked up our order. He thanked me for giving them a try and threw in some extra garlic knots. I will encourage friends and family to come here."}
{"text":"There is a good reason this place is highly rated on yelp!! I called ahead and ordered a few of their Philly Cheese Steaks to go. The moment I walked in through their doors the owner Tony greeted me, wanted to know how I heard about the place, and gave me some history on their family owned business. I was super happy with the customer service I received, and my order was only a to-go order. I cannot wait to come back and dine inside. Everything coming out of the kitchen smelled delicious, and the Philly Cheese Steaks were fantastic!
I plan on coming here more often and cannot wait to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Great spot for all kinds of Italian....   only thing holding back the fifth star is the service.  We had to ask for our salads, which came right before the entree.  They say us towards the back, almost felt forgotten. 

Food was on point.  I tried the Sicilian and thin crust pizza slices, both excellent!!!   The chicken Parmesan was also ordered by others, thumbs up!!!!   Garlic knots were great as well.  

Definitely coming back again."}
{"text":"This is seriously one of my favorite places to go and bring others to. I ordered a 18 in with wings and some garlic knots on my way home from kids soccer practice. It was plenty to feed my family of six and for a good price! The pizza is always amazing! From the moment I step in the door I feel so welcome. They always above and beyond to make sure I'm greeted and taken care of. If pizza was low calorie and no fat I would eat here everyday! The new place looks awesome. Congrats to Casanova Bros. May your business continue to grow! You deserve it."}
{"text":"Friendliest staff ever! They remember led my name from meeting me once! Food is excellent and such a homey vibe!  You feel like your own family is in the kitchen. Food is delicious and made with love. Definitely recommend this spot."}
{"text":"I brought a group of students to Casanova Brothers for lunch and they were so patient and kind! It was awesome. They have many lunch specials for decent prices - under 10$, with some pasta dishes closer to 5....awesome! Further, their white pizza was amazingly tasty. Their regular slices were alright, but didn't hold a candle to the white. It's too bad they're so far from my house, but I'm excited that they are moving into a larger space and would definitely return."}
{"text":"Waited an hour  despite a light crowd for a Sat. night for our food which never arrived. The waiter said our order had been lost. Salads never came...I flagged waiter to inquire. No ownership. We got up and left, after waiting over an hour. I say \"Don't bother\"!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! Everyone was super friendly. Place is clean, pizza was amazing! Will definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"I stopped in here as I was driving by and saw the sign \"Pizza by the slice.\" It was lunchtime and pizza sounded good. As I walked in I was greeted by Tony Casanova, one of the owners. He asked my name and if this was my first time here. I told him my name is Gene and it was my first time here. He hollered to the back, \"Hey Mike, This is Gene and this is his first time here\". He shook my hand and said \"Welcome. How can I get for you\". The reason for this little narrative is to highlight the hospitality afforded this establishment. I ordered a slice of the Sicilian pizza with sausage. It was ready within 5 minutes. 

Tony also threw in an order of garlic knots and dipping sauce just because this was my first time here. I don't remember when the last time I walked into a restaurant and was met with this kind of customer service. The pizza slice was quite large, probably 1/8 of a 18\" extra large pizza. The pizza and garlic knots were good. I am interested in returning for a dine-in experience soon."}
{"text":"I don't know if it was raised expectations from reading all the glowing reviews or I just went on an off day, but I was largely underwhelmed by Casanova Bros.

The garlic knots, which were talked about so much came free since it was my first time (which was nice) but they had been reheated in a microwave it seemed and were overly chewy and not fresh tasting. The sauce was good, however.

The margherita pizza was just wrong. WAY too garlicky and I love garlic. The tomatoes were diced and the cheese was far too thin, the crust was a nice texture but lacked flavor. The sauce was just \"meh\" and it was very greasy.

The guy working the front counter was very friendly and I loved the atmosphere of the place. However, considering the other nearby options I don't think I'll be back for a second try."}
{"text":"Grabbed a couple of slices for lunch today after stumbling onto the glowing reviews here.  I concur - these guys make a good pie!  As others mentioned, the joint was almost empty at 12:30pm - NOT good.  If you're in the area, do check Casanova Bros out, I think you'll be glad you did and will become a regular.  If I lived closer, I would most definitely be back often."}
{"text":"It is a rare event when people try to provide an authentic experience however this family owned and operated business goes for that achievement with their traditional New York theme. The flavors and food are consistently patterned after their history growing up in New York. Most people love the flavors and food elements offered here however if you aren't a fan of this style pizza it's not the pizzas bad it's that you are from Chicago! The crust here is perfect thin crispy holds up the toppings and the pie is not greasy. I consider this real pizza the kind of thing you enjoy with the right beer and a group of friends you like. It's not fancy but it's quality and this many people that say it's so right just can't be wrong. Don't cheat yourself out of a pleasant eating experience by being a deep disher fan. They also have some great sandwiches and appetizers to complete the dining experience so keep and open mind and an open mouth when you go."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. We had take out but since it was our first Time they gave us a few nots to try. House salads were ok. Nothing fancy. Pizza was good. I thought a bit pricey but the service made it worth it. Will try again. Thanks"}
{"text":"New to the area and decided to try the place out after looking at the reviews. First of all the building inside is beautiful. They look like they did a lot of work to get the New York-Esque vibe. 
The young host was very kind and allowed me to chose my own seat. It must be what they do during lunch hours. Immediately my server Kalisha comes and asks me how I am doing and if I've ever been there before. After finding out we are new in the area she reached out and asked for our names with a warm hand shake! Where I'm from you don't get that type of attention unless you are exchanging business. The service was very pleasant and she continued to use my and my husbands name throughout the meal and even listened to my ranting about my hometown and exchanged good conversation even when dealing with other people. 


Now for the FOOD! We were recommended the white slice which was FANTASTIC. I've never had a white pizza with so much flavor without feeling so heavy on my stomach. Definitely ordering the XL next time. The complimentary garlic knots were tasty and a nice touch to their friendly vibe. 

While we were finishing up our meal we got to meet the owner Tony. A true gentleman. He too asked our names and what brought us there. It's good to see that the etiquette of Tony flows down to their servers. You can tell they care about everyone that walks in. Even if the food wasn't amazing I'd still come in for the service. Tell Kalisha I said \"I just came by to say hi\" (inside joke haha)"}
{"text":"If you haven't eaten here you need to come down. 
We used to come when it was just a hole in the wall in a strip mall. 
Now they've grown into a full sized restaurant (in the same shopping center).
The owner, Tony, is one of the most personable human beings I've ever met. He wants to know your name, make you comfortable and ensure you don't leave wanting for food or ambiance. 
Our waitress was friendly and attentive, to the point that she brought out a basket of imaginary fish for my sons stuffed otter!
The White Pizza is the best I've ever had, and I'm a bit of a snob. 
My dad had the hot wings and I had to restrain myself from stealing some. 
My mom had pasta with sausage, grilled onions/peppers and loads of cheese. 
They even modified a dish for my sister to meet her dietary needs. 
Everything was delicious!
Do yourself a favor and come try this place. 
Casinova Brothers. NE of Val Vista and Guadalupe."}
{"text":"Delicious!! One of the best pizza joints in Gilbert.
Order ahead of time to avoid the long lines on weeknights, weekends.
*Lunch is easy on the pocketbook."}
{"text":"Been there twice.  First  time was clearly 5 stars second time was 3 stars.  Pizza was not as crispy and we had it cooked a bit more the second time   there.    Place is great.  Tony is awesome.  We will go back.  Very fair prices."}
{"text":"Extremely authentic Italian food best garlic knots/fried zucchini  I've ever had simple but satisfying menu and I haven't even gotten m pasta/pizza yet."}
{"text":"First off they greet just about everyone by name! That's right the customer base is where they start and that's doing it right! They remember people who come all the time. Portions are large, food is fresh I can't wait to go back! I got the cheese ravioli and it was probably close to the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"This us one of the best Pizza places in the Phoenix Valley... Their sauce is not overly sweet and has a nice spicy overtone that makes the whole pie work as a culinary delight. Price wise, Casanova is a far better deal than the Coal Fired Pizza at San Tan Village."}
{"text":"I can't wait to come back here! I believe they recently renovated it to expand it and it's so nice. The food was delicious. I'm definitely going to be coming back here!"}
{"text":"best food I've ever eaten. Pasta doesn't even have words and the pizza is phenomenal. The service is just the cherry on top of the whole experience."}
{"text":"This is hands down one of my favorite pizza places in the whole valley!  New York style pizza/garlic knots/cannolis served by the nicest brothers in town.  They WILL remember your name.  Don't be surprised if when you call for takeout, they give you a ridiculously long wait time (up to an hour)--it's only because they make everything fresh with the best ingredients (and everyone in town knows it, so the place is usually packed)!  Their margherita pizza is heavenly--but you will repel vampires and those around you for a day or so due to the garlic--but it's SO worth it!  Also, the food is a bit more pricey than a normal pizza joint but I think it's justified for the quality and taste of what you're getting.  Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"The customer service here is above all else! I've never had such friendly personal service before! We were greeted promptly and  enthusiastically! We had garlic knots first and they were amazing, great little bites full of flavor. We had the deep dish pizza, half white, half red and it was fantastic!! I love it both ways! We also had cheese garlic bread and Zepolis that were as delicious as everything else!!"}
{"text":"My wife is from New York and she knows pizza and she agrees with me that this is the best pizza in the valley. The owner walked up to is and introduced himself to us and he was very confident he was one of best in the valley and I totally agree, Casanova bros in my go to spot from now on!!!"}
{"text":"Featured on BuzzFeed's list, \"The Best Pizza Spot In Every State, According To Yelp\" --- Casanova Brothers Pizza!

Practically skipping into this clean and great establishment, I was greeted by one of the brothers, Tony.  Charisma and charm exuded from the guy as he introduced himself with a firm handshake. I like this guy! After our order was placed, we took our number to a booth and sat down for a delicious pizza meal. 

First to come out were some garlic knots on the house from Tony for being first time customers. Fluffy little knots of dough with a kiss of garlic were set before us. Dip it in the supplied marinara and enjoy! Next out was our order of piping hot fried zucchini. These babies were amazing! A little while later, a beautiful 16\" Deluxe pie was brought to the table. The crust was thin, crispy, and charred nicely. And it wasn't greasy! But did it pass the fold test? It did. The toppings stayed in place and the first bite had a good amount of cheese drag. While our pie held ample toppings, the prevailing taste was the sauce. Mmm! As for eating it cold from the fridge, it was just as satisfying. 

All in all, it was a great experience. Tony would come by every now and then to check on things, addressing us by our names, and gushed with pride about how fresh and great their product is. We even heard him talking about making the Buzzfeed list! Here's hoping they thrive in their new and bigger location once they open! Much success, Casanova Brothers!

{"text":"The pizza is great, but what makes me give this establishment 5 stars is the fact that the owners are extremely nice and take the time to cater to their customers needs. They really make you feel like family in there, and the pizza is very similar to what you'd find in the big Apple."}
{"text":"I love pizza and had to try Casanova's, but decided on the lasagna and it was a hit. They through in so free garlic knots and provided great service. They ask my name and the rest of the visit they referenced me by name with each other and not a table number. Like they noticed I was done and someone told my waiter that I needed my ticket and said my name, not the table.  They didn't even know I was listening as they were on the other side of the restaurant. Really like this place."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, this place is so good!  Immediately greeted by Tony and he was very friendly.  Matt was our server and he was great.  We went with his recommendations as it was our first visit.  Didn't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Soooo GOOD!! I really enjoyed their pizza.  It's like old home week when you walk in.  Very welcoming Tony is a lot of fun.  and Mike too.  We had thier Caprese, Margherita, hawaiian, cheese, bbq chicken, and suasage pepperoni and mushroom.  We will go again."}
{"text":"Tony has mastered the art of customer service! Outstanding friendliness, great salesman pairing various toppings with different bases, and the pizza is great. Shows continuing interest in his customers and is very generous with complimentary food items, for us it was garlic knots & cannolis. A \"must experience\" for all!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness!  I am Italian and the food is fantastic!  I love the \"sauce\" or \"gravy\" whatever word you choose.  Great flavor.  Great price for the amount of food.  The owner is so genuine and loves what he does.  Tony!  you have a great place!"}
{"text":"Great food and customer service!  My girlfriend Crystal and I were greeted upon entering by Tony the owner and was welcomed in like family.  Had some really good buffalo wings and garlic balls and a delicious chicken pizza with the thin crust.  Loved every bite of it.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great food! And thank goodness they are moving right across the parking lot to a bigger place, because they were hoppin busy!! Even so, we didn't wait long at all and the super friendly employees and owners Tony and Mike are a breath of fresh air! Can't wait to go to their new place on Val vista Dr.  I think they said in Feburary!  Yay!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic, but honestly this place gets five stars on the top-notch service alone. The manager, Tony, was incredibly personable. Gave us free garlic knots because it was our first time, as well as a dessert! We ordered the baked ziti, fried zucchini, and a white Sicilian. All of them were awesome, and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have been to Casanova Brothers Pizza twice and had good experiences both times. The owner was there the first time I went, and he was very friendly and got to know my name. I felt very welcome and appreciated on both occasions.

I have tried the pizza as well as the pasta. I enjoyed pretty much everything I have eaten at Casanova Brothers Pizza. They have both Sicilian and New York style pizza available, and I would recommend either one. The pasta was very tasty as well. The prices are reasonable too.

The restaurant is a bit small and gets quite crowded, so you may want to go during non-peak hours. You order at the counter, and then the food is brought to your table. Despite the crowds, the food arrives quickly.

If you are in the mood for tasty pizza or pasta at a reasonable prices, definitely try Casanova Brothers Pizza ."}
{"text":"Yummmm!
Sicilian pizza was the bomb! The medium is huge, so lunch tomorrow is ready too!

Tony is uber friendly and greets everyone and remembers their names."}
{"text":"First timers in my group of six visited this week.  We were treated as if we were royalty by Tony.  We received the complimentary garlic knots which were soft and when dipped in the sauce were a tasteful delight.  The pizza pies were delectable, perfectly baked, with fresh ingredients.  In holding with the Italian tradition of treating everyone who walks through the door as family you simply can't go wrong eating here.  Food, service, and very personal touch in their service makes this business go on my \"A\" list!  Thank you Tony and crew for a wonderful experience.  We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Super friendly service. You can taste the freshness in the ingredients and a family friendly environment. I consider finding them a win!"}
{"text":"Being a native New Yorker, we have found that it is tough to find a great pizza place.   Their pizza is absolutely delicious.   Not only is this place great, but they make you feel like family.   After your first visit, you can be assured that Tony will remember your name.   :))"}
{"text":"I shudder to think what life was like before Casanova Brother's... this is the go to place for an authentic NYC style pizza experience in Gilbert, AZ.  The bread, garlic knots, pizza crust, and even the marinara is made from scratch and fresh each day. Fresh local ingredients are what makes this menu pop.   The marinara is addictive... perfect for the fried Calamari... be sure to ask for extra sauce.  =)

Since Casanova Brother's opened, we've tried almost everything on the menu - and I haven't been disappointed yet.  If you are low carb'ing... then try the made from scratch meatballs.  Pure NYC comfort food at it's  finest.  =)

Attention to the customer experience is amazing and very sincere... a few times we have had to wait for take out and each time the staff chatted with us by name and offered us sodas (free) while we waited."}
{"text":"I ordered take out, Saturday night around 8pm. It was ready in 25 min, accompanied with two free sodas and garlic knots. It was my first time ordering. The owner Tony greeted us, shook my hand and rang me up. Great place!"}
{"text":"What sets Casanova Brothers apart? 

Definitely the food, it's homemade and authentic, the Pizza is true to New York style and has great crust. Tony the owner is from New York and has that perfect New York blend of not wasting any time but also having a good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Good pizza.  Ordered the white pizza...had the right amount ricotta"}
{"text":"This is the most INCREDIBLE pizza I have ever had. Super friendly customer service, and amazing food! Went back a second time since yesterday because I couldn't wait to eat it again! YUMMMMMM"}
{"text":"A-Plus..Tony, Mike Jr, Luigi & the entire crew make you feel like you are the most important customer there is. Food is awesome, service is excellent. I've had pizza, both neo & sicilian, garlic knots, ravioli, manicotti, calzone. they have all been great. Been going there for 5 years, there is no other place for me."}
{"text":"Pretty good. I had the sausage and peppers parmesan style, it came with a lot of sausage, alot of sausage. Some of the people I went with ordered the regular servings of fettuccini and shrimp, it looked small, but they said it was filling afterward. Our food took a while to come out, a little longer than I thought it should. The wait staff is very friendly and the owner came out and side hello and offered us free appetizers. It's worth a visit int the area, I'll probably come back again to try a few other items from the menu."}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic east coast pizza this is the place.  The food is great and I've had just about everything on the menu.  Tony and the crew are quite possibly the most friendly restaurant people I've ever met.  No matter who's behind the counter you'll always get a greeting when you come in.  Tony even goes as far as asking your name and most times will remember it the next time you come in.   If it's your first time there you'll get a complimentary side of garlic knots.  Tony if you're reading this you guys do a great job...your buddy Boston Chris...GO RedSox"}
{"text":"Waiting over 90 minutes to get 2 one item pizzas is flat out stupid. I can't plan my day around will I want to eat pizza 2 hours from now. Plus they waited till I payed and then told me it will be another 20 minutes. Don't care how good the pizza is if the service is like this."}
{"text":"Let me try and describe as so many other people have reviewed the experience as a first time customer to this restaurant.  Once we get in the door we get greeted with a smile and since we didn't know what we wanted the cashier (forget her name) asked us our names and shook our hands as she introduced.  She helped us with our first pizza, and cannoli's, and on the house garlic knots for being first timers.

The garlic knots were tiny portions of garlic bread which was a nice appetizer and the pizza was absolutely divine.  Best pizza I have had in a long while, authentic and the meats used were so flavorful.  Not to mention I actually enjoyed eating the crust as it was good by itself.  This is someplace I will be taking others to and I can't wait to try the other pizzas.  The cannoli's were also very good and although I doubt anything will measure up to my wifes grandma's cannoli's, these were pretty darn close!

I am excited to support and contribute a review to such a well run establishment that has so much character throughout!  If in the Phoenix area, treat yourself and stop by."}
{"text":"Friendly service greatest NY style pizza in the area. They know you by name and treat you like family.  Definitely the closest feel to the east coast out here in az. I will forever be coming here. It reminds me of being back home in NY and NJ"}
