{"text":"Great place and service. I was there back in September with my wife and her uncle for her birthday and I had a broken hand. I ordered the steak and the waiter (Ken) took my plate and cut up the steak for me for my convenience even though I didn't ask for it. The place was great and I would go there again."}
{"text":"Went down to Boulder Station to catch Little Feat in concert.  It was an incredible show and ended at the perfect time to grab a nice late evening dinner on a Friday night.  My husband and I noticed The Broiler, checked out the menu and got a table with no problem at 9:30pm.

Service was superb.  The hostess was a very sweet woman who greeted us with a bright, interested smile, held the door for us, showed us the salad bar, and seated us in a cozy booth as we had requested.  The bus boy was one of the best assistants I have seen.  Always present without stalking us, clearing things away seconds after we finished with them, and having carry out bags ready to go, eager to put our leftovers in the stack of containers he brought for us.  The waitress was one of those women who could really maintain control of her responsibilities while being pleasant and inviting.  She genuinely seemed happy to see us, just like every staff member we encountered at The Broiler.  Service was quick, ultra-efficient, and super friendly.  Ambience was calm and relaxing.

I chose the shrimp dinner and the waitress offered various ways for preparation: Panko, battered, or broiled.  I went with Panko (fried in breadcrumbs).  Excellent choice. $25

My husband picked the swordfish.  Also offered several preparation options, he chose blackened.  He loved it. $30

But the biggest surprise of the night was the incredible soup and salad bar.  This was actually included with our low priced entrees!  We each took a huge helping of the  New England Clam Chowder with those cute little hexagon crackers and then created our own salads of iceberg lettuce salad with bleu cheese crumbles and dressing, tomatoes, hard-boiled eggs, croutons....they had so many toppings.  It was fantastic.  I then tried another salad they had up there: broccoli and chicken in a light cream sauce.  It was unreal.  I literally could have just eaten this all night and I would have been satisfied.  This broccoli and chicken salad was a dinner starter for me but I can't help but think it would also make for a refreshing summer lunch.

The selection of breads were also delicious.  We really liked the warm pretzel bread.

Sodas were crisp.  Espressos were perfect.

Perhaps we have been eating on The Strip too much.  The Broiler was a really nice find with a hometown feel and an affordably-priced menu.  We will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Perhaps we should have known better than to go to a steakhouse for Thanksgiving dinner, but the advertising for the Thanksgiving dinner sounded good, so this is where we ended up with a son and two granddaughters. The Thanksgiving dinner was set--no substitutions. It included the salad and soup bar, which was nothing special but okay. The choice of entrée was turkey or prime rib--4 of us chose turkey--and the vegetables regardless of entrée were (yuck) Brussel sprouts and a sweet potato dish with burnt marshmallows on top. What chef would choose to serve Brussel sprouts without allowing a substitution--like maybe peas?  No dessert was included in the dinner price. The fact we were willing to pay extra to satisfy our taste buds which were yammering for pumpkin pie did not matter--there was no pumpkin pie--or even mince--available. What chef would plan a Thanksgiving dinner without pumpkin pie? Next year, we will go somewhere else."}
{"text":"After amassing some points we decided to spend some of them here after I had made some football bets.  Normally, Station casinos are not great lines but they have higher limits than one would think, about double the Hilton.

Anyway, we were seated after a slight delay and I got the Delmonico and my girl friend just had the salad bar.  The salad is very good and included in entrees or by itself with soup for $16.

They have more variety than most salad bars and very good quality including bleu cheese crumbles, asparagus, shrimp salad, peas, artichokes, palm hearts, etc.  That night they had red and Boston clam chowder--the latter was pretty good.

The bread basket is below average consisting of thick sour dough slices and raisin bread.  My steak was a little slow in coming.  The 24 oz. ribeye was served with a side of zucchini/squash, a baked potato and bernaise sauce in a little container.

Ribeye was a pretty good quality steak about an inch and 1/4 thick with fairly good marbling.  Overall it was not up to the quality of Craftsteak but worth the smaller price tag.  The spud was about 6 inches lond and as thick as my wrist at its plumpest part.  

Vegetables were very crisp and hot, a good treatment of a so-so side.  I prefer mushrooms with steaks.  The only complaint was the bernaise which was served cool.  I don't use it for steaks but I dabbed some on the veggies.  Everything else was done correctly except this.

Service was good except for that small delay in getting seated.  My girlfriend enjoyed the salad bar and didn't go back for seconds even though there are no limits on trips back.

Pros:

1.  Pretty good value for the money.
2.  Very good salad bar.
3.  Clam chowder above average.
4.  Steak quality and cooking execution pretty good.
5.  Decent service.

Cons:

1.  Bread not very good.
2.  Food temperature inconsistent.
3.  Not so great for wines, none was ordered.

Overall for about $63 including tax and tip it was worthwhile.  It is an in-between place.  Not quite fine dining but not diner food either.  If you go in expecting this you probably won't be disappointed.  

If you are with a big group you will not like it.  It is set up mostly for booths so aranging tables might not be feasible all the time."}
{"text":"Another fantastic meal at the Broiler.  Nicole at the hostess desk is always polite and professional.  We always request Steven as our waiter, he is the best.  He is very friendly and attentive to our special order requests.  Our food is always delicious and comes exactly the way we ordered it.  We travel from Summerlin a few times a month to eat at the Broiler because our food and service are always exceptional.  We are looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"We were shocked that this place was not busy on a Friday nite.  The food is delicious, the salad bar is very fresh and the service is outstanding.  Rita the hostess makes you feel like your family.  Locals should flock here, it is a great value, I had halibut, it came with veggies and salad bar.  The bread basket is also good.  All this for $24, amazing.  We certainly hope this encourages more people to give this place a chance.  We love it and can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Very good, not impressed with French onion soup the rest was awesome. My wife and I Had oyster Rockefeller, escargot, French onion soup, Chilean sea bass with purple Peruvian mashed potatoes with broccolette and carrots. And pan seared halibut."}
{"text":"Niice -- why does this place  have to be in the Palace Station?!? Ole' lady helped us to our seat like it was 1973 all over again - loved it! I even got moldy bread but I'd still go back and bite into that New York steak they got going there! Yum yum ... water always full, Black Label and 7Ups were well done at the bar ... deicious!! but seriously - no moldy bread next time, plz."}
{"text":"We live in Vegas and go to the Broiler once or twice a year. We went tonight and apparently they changed the menu since we were there last. Everything is ala carte. You have to buy a side dish separately. And the prices for the entrees are ridiculous. They are charging strip prices. We will never go back. The quality of the fish seemed worse than Red Lobster. Think twice before going here."}
{"text":"The best steak I've had. Juicy, and cooked to perfection... Bone in rib eye more like cave man rib eye... Delicious steak flavor and bite no bs flavoring just meat at it's best... Great specials too but I think I'll stick with bone in rib eye and complimentary salad bar no need for sides. Pretzel bread also amazing"}
{"text":"Unbelievable. Salad bar not bad but waiter was clueless. My friends scallops were uncooked and three of us who ordered Halibut got Sea Bass which wasn't on the menu. We sent it back. They adjusted bill accordingly."}
{"text":"I haven't been here for many many years and decided to come here yesterday. We both had escargot for an appetizer which was made really well, and I had the filet with a side order of scallops, my mom had the sea bass.  I can't even begin to tell you the phenomenal cook on the filet, the scallops were so buttery I didn't need a knife to cut them.  My mom's sea bass was flaking off with her fork.  We sat in Stephen's section and had a couple visits from Kenneth the manager just to make sure everything was to our liking.

I can't say enough wonderful things about this meal, one thing I will say is the béarnaise sauce that I got with my filet... I would put that on anything, it was THAT good."}
{"text":"Aside from the Palace Station Hotel itself, which was one of the worst DUMPS I had the privilege of staying in, The Broiler Restaurant off the main casino was pretty good.  This place exceeded my expectations which at the time were not very high due to my previous hotel experience.

We had the Filet Mignon steaks, baked potato, dinner salad, and glasses of their house wine; all very good!  The steaks were tender and cooked to perfection.  The side dishes were also prepared very well.

The service and attentiveness to detail could have been slightly better.  They did forget to bring my glass of wine, and had to remind them of that fact.  Other than that, the food itself gets a high rating for excellence."}
{"text":"The scallops are wonderful and they have a great salad bar. The service is top notch."}
{"text":"3 of us ordered fresh halibut prepared in different ways: Oscar, pan seared and blackened. The 4th one ordered pan seared scallops. Sent everything back. Scallops were raw and the \"halibut\" wasn't halibut at all...the Chef came out and admitted it was sea bass. Each of the preparations tasted strange. To make it worse, even though we were nice about it our waiter wasn't! Another young server came over to appologise.
Not a place I would recommend."}
{"text":"Going to the broiler for 4 years now and still loving it. the prime rib soup is awesome highly recommend. Kathy and urial server and co server in Las Vegas. I like the seafood platter for under 30 bucks and my wife gets the New York steak for under 30 bucks and we share and let's call it surf and turf. Still the best value in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I actually had low expectations for this place since it's all off strip, and I usually think steakhouse on the strip are good, but this one is actually pretty good!
Pros:
-Excellent Salad Bar!
-Excellent Service!
-EXCEELLLENT FOOD!
Cons:
-Pricey in some areas
-Service might take a while
-Food takes time to get prepared
I ordered the Surf and Turf, and even though I waited, I still got to eat because there's the salad bar! The Salad Bar was decent, it had salad, it had soup, it worked as an appetizer. When I got the Surf and Turf, it was the best! I tried the steak and it was cooked to perfection! The Lobster was really filling, it was just delicious! Then they asked if I wanted dessert, \"What do you have?\" I asked. Then they bring me a cart full of all the desserts they had. \"WHOA\" I said, well since I was eating with a group, we just got everything! It was delicious, pretty exquisite, perfect! When I left, I just had a bunch of To-Go Boxes. It was so good, we had to get a bunch to-go! This place is really good, and I recommend you eat here!"}
{"text":"Steak, lobster, shrimp, oysters, salad and soup bar. 

The 12 oz New York strip was very flavorful. It tasted marinaded and rubbed with spices. There were thin strips of fat around the edges that were crusted over with salty crispiness.

The baked yam was soft, sweet and delicious. I loved the cinnamon sugar butter that came on the side. I spread it over my yam and it melted into it'd threads, bringing out yet even more sweetness.  The consistency was like custard. 

The meal came with bread for starters. Focaccia, pita triangles, raisin walnut, and soft pretzel.  Dip the complimentary soft pretzel into the cinnamon sugar butter intended for the yam. It's delicious.

The fries were really good. They were skinny, came in a newspaper cone and were hot and crispy. 

The soup and salad bar also came with the meal. Make your own salad with ingrediants like spinach, beets, mushrooms, cucumbers, and tomatoes with several choices of dressings. Grab a chilled plate! The clam chowder and chicken noodle looked tasty, but I didn't try it.

The service was timely.  It wasn't that busy on a Wednesday night, and our food came out shortly after we set aside our finished salads. Our server was definitely up selling drinks, apps, and desserts, but wasn't overly pushy.

For two steaks and two sides it was $67 plus tip."}
{"text":"We came in to the broiler not knowing what to expect and we were received by first name and treated like  friends. The food is amazing and our server Jude and her partner Elle are amazing people and they are kind and generous. They love to serve and do their job to the best of their ability. We will make the broiler our date night place from now on."}
{"text":"As the first Yelper stated great steakhouse!

 Cozy, dim lighted atmo. 
 The variety of fresh baked bread includes a rosemary sourdough, raisin bread (not my fav.) and a Deelish soft fresh fat warm yummy pretzel (accompanied with unsalted butter).  

Wine menu is offered ( and passed up).
Dinner menu has about a dozen entrees, the entree includes on side and the buffet soup & salad bar.

I decided on the Porter house Pork Chop ($25) with Mashed potato as my side and my hubby picked the Seafood combo platter($28) and side of French fries. each additional side if $5. But it's really not nessasary.

after our friendly server took our order I went to check out the salad bar.  WOW, was I impressed! started off with the regular Iceberg, then a Garden Mix, followed by a Creamy Dill Shrimp salad, Deelish and colorful Crab Salad, Also Plain but tasty Tuna Salad. Just as you pass down a ways, the nicely diced and pretty shredded veggies that make your build-it-yourself salad look oh so gourmet.  Salad Buffet concluded with a Minestrone soup and my FAVORITE Creamy Asparagus and Crab soup. SOOO GOOOD (chunks of realllly yummy crab mmmm)

Ok, so our Pork shop was HUGE, smashed potato's were real and yummy....
My husbands seafood platter was disappointingly all fried but he did chose to substitute the oysters and scallops for more Orange Roughy and HUGE shrimp. 

\"First time I've ever been full off shrimp\" is what my meat and potato man said to me. 

I'm sure we will be back, although this kind of restaurant is a treat for us Parents on a budget. (we were on a date night just FYI)

Our dinner was about $62.00 including tip but we did not splurge. The Surf & Turf was a bit steep at $63. and Lobster tail about $48.  But I bet it's awesome."}
{"text":"The friendliest staff I have encountered almost as if they were my family. The prices were reasonable and the prime rib is the best.  I love the crab cakes, bacon wrapped  shrimp for my appetizer . My sides I favor the spinach , asparagus , or sweet potato.  Wine knowledge  and selection pairs perfectly. Compliments to the chef and bonus to staff. Manager is a charming fella I might add."}
{"text":"I wish I didn't have to give this place a 3. Let me start off by saying everything was overall good. Our server was really sweet and answered all our questions easily. We ordered scallops to start, a New York strip with a Gorgonzola crust, a side of asparagus and a side of creamed corn. Our scallops took a while to come out, a couple that sat down before us got their food before we even had our first course, and our scallops were underdone, we still ate them but wish they were a little more cooked. Our steak was cooked perfect. We got the gorgonzola CRUST, it's really just melted cheese on top. Creamed corn and asparagus were cooked and seasoned really well. Over all a good place but pretty average, they have potential to be a lot better."}
{"text":"This is a really nice and cozy dimly lit place..  Kind of surprising for Boulder Station...  The crab cake appetizer was very good and the free salad bar with soups and fruit was a nice touch with the entree...  I do admit, it is kind of strange to have a salad bar in a nice restaurant though.  The only big disappointment was the main course.  My filet that I ordered medium came out more well done and was charred.  Maybe do what another reviewer says and order it one level below what you actually want.  I suffered through and ate it, but I would not do it again.  I should have sent it back for sure and will if I ever go there again!  If I could make another recommendation I would say go to Sonoma Cellar at Sunset Station.  The filet there was absolutely magnificent and the prices are just a few dollars more.  No free salad bar at Sonoma Cellar but the salad bar at the Broiler was not worth the horrible filet."}
{"text":"Looks and feels like Denny's in 1991, food costs nearly as much as Ruth's Chris and tastes like something in between. Outback? Chilis? TGI Friday's? You get the point. 

To make matters worse, we were one of only two parties in the restaurant at 9:30pm, so the waitress had no reason for providing such lackluster service.

$79 for two people, and we didn't order drinks. Ouch."}
{"text":"This place looks like my house growing up in the 80s, hideous wood paneling and boring paintings of sailboats included. So take my advice and look down at your plate instead of looking at the walls because the food was delicious.  

The wedge salad was superb as wedge salads usually are. The bacon wrapped shrimp and the tomato/mozzarella were great appetizers. Steaks are the way to go here and the mushroom side dish was pretty damn amazing. They also have an impressive dessert menu including cheesecake from Carnegie deli in NY and this ice cream ball monstrosity."}
{"text":"Every casino has some sort of attempt at a classy steakhouse- this is Boulder Station's. It's not bad for what it is, with a decent selection of steaks and seafood. Prices are low, quality is higher than the pricing leads you to expect, and the service is on par with a non-casino steakhouse (in other words, good).

There are quite a few apps to pick from- the escargot is my recommendation, but the scallops are good too. Interestingly, they have a large soup and salad bar as the main focal point of the dining room, and it's free with most of the featured entrees (or $14 a la carte)- lots of fresh veggies to pick from, two soups, and it's unlimited.

The prime rib is a popular entrée here, order early or be prepared to settle for medium. If you're a rare-or-nothing kind of person, the porterhouse is a good backup. Just don't gnaw on the bone like a caveman.

TIP: If you have the BS players card, you will get quarterly coupons via mail for $20 credit here ($40 minimum)!"}
{"text":"We were there about 6:30 PM and received excellent service. Maitre d' welcomed and seated us in a nice booth. Our drinks were ordered and our waiter presented the specials. Clearly, we got special attention from start to finish. The waiter watched attentively to time our service so the entrees arrived once we had time to enjoy our dinner salads. The salmon was delicious and I'm told so was the prime rib. Dessert was a refreshing sorbet big enough to share."}
{"text":"This is the \"steakhouse\" at Palace Station. More like a regurgitation of their crappy coffee shop chow, in a slighly more appealing atmosphere.

FOOD: The worst orange roughy I have ever tasted... mushy, soggy and repulsive. Dry pork chop, bland creamed spinach. Stale, old looking items on the salad bar. 

SERVICE: Our waiter was poorly trained and indifferent.  He did not even know the difference between Bouillabaise and Ciopinno.

One star for the good bread basket (pretty hard to screw up store-bought bread). 

Don't bother."}
{"text":"Fantastic Food.  First let me say that they have an awesome salad bar that is included in the meal.  I ordered the petite filet mignon and it was fantastic.  The portion was larger than the average petite filet mignon and the meat was extremely tender and tasty.  We ordered garlic mashed potatoes that was delicious.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I went here earlier tonight and had a really nice experience. Great atmosphere, very attentive service, awesome salad bar and soups included with entre. The manager Kenneth made us feel very welcomed by checking on us multiple times along with our great waiter. Thanks a lot guys! And OMG the food was AMAZING!!! We order bacon wrapped shrimp with filet mignon which were so tasty. They put out quality food here. Best filet mignon I have ever had. Melted in my mouth like butter. They use their homemade marinade. I highly suggest this resturant at the Boulder station. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"don't let the tacky flashing slot machine lights and the smell of old carpet deter you from this place.

\"How hot would you like your dish?\"
\"Slap a kick-me sign on me and give me a 7!!\"

7 had quite the kick, but one i welcomed with open arms. I ordered the combo roast with shrimp and one scoop of rice.  I also ordered a place of raw oysters, fresh but i came across one that was sand-y.

i have mixed feelings for this place.  It's something i would crave if i was  in foggy San Francisco.  However, in las Vegas,  the consistency of this dish did not go well with the alcohol diet i was on nor the sweltering humidity. Next time,  i might ask for another scoop of rice next time or something less soupy.  I was praying that i would not replicate the dish later on that night, via throw-up."}
{"text":"A great steakhouse. Service is always impeccable, a killer bone-in ribeye, and a wonderful salad/soup bar (that is included with your meal). Honestly? You don't really need a starch to accomany your slab o'meat, the salad/soup bar will suffice; along with the yummy bread basket of course. I've never had a sub-par meal here; and in fact, the family has started to include the Broiler as part of any celebratory meal. Good times, really good food."}
{"text":"One of the best kept secrets in Las Vegas, Prices are reasonable for steakhouse, One of the best filet I have ever had and  made perfect I have had dinner in most of the steakhouses in Las Vegas and for the buck this was the best, Wife had crab legs that was a huge order and delicious, Service was the best. Restaurant is a very comfortable environment. Old casino with up to date steakhouse. One of the few steakhouses with a salad and soup bar included with meal, very unusual for a Las Vegas steakhouse and it was also excellent."}
{"text":"By far one of the best meal experiences in my life. Like the food and our server Jude so much we went back a secind night. It would be my staple hangout if I lived in the region. Simply perfect! Prices were more than reasonable. Will be there again a few times next year when I come back. Request Jude as your server. You will not be sorry. Best server EVER!"}
{"text":"Best Rib Eye Steak I've ever had, and I mean ever!!
I'm not even sure what they do to it, and I really don't care.
Allow me to digress for a moment: My best friend and I drove up to Boulder Station to see UFO at The Railhead (huge fans for 35 years).We arrived a day early and felt like having a really good steak dinner and we were about to venture out of the hotel when several people told us about The Broiler. \"It's right downstairs, pass the slots, make a right and it's in the corner\" 

We find it no problem and walk in, they meet us, greet us and seat us, we look around, wow, what a blast from the past, this place is cool, an old school steakhouse vibe. Everyone was very nice. We both order \"The Delmonico\". Now, understand, my friend of 35 years is not only a food critic, but he does all of the cooking in his family and can sometimes be hard to please. When our plates arrived, it was love at first sight, they were very well presented, the smell was carnivore heaven. They did some buttery, crispy thing on the outside and perfectly tender and melt in your mouth thing on the inside. This was recommended by our waitress and it was their priciest piece of meat, I think we paid $60.00 each but would've paid more. If you ever get the opportunity, tell them Handsome Joe sent you.

PS: UFO kicked ass!!!!"}
{"text":"We have lived in Las Vegas for 30 years and been eating a couple of times per week at restaurants all over town and by far the Broiler at Boulder Station is our favorite restaurant. The staff is always friendly the food is always magnificently prepared the soups are homemade the dressings are homemade and it's very reasonable. The salad bar is fresh and well maintained. Could not have a higher recommendation."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night.We had the salad bar.Excellent 4 stars
We split a ribeye,outstanding  5 stars
Service could have been a lot better.Once our server,Kenny saw that we had a coupon his whole demeanor changed.Never told us the specials.Threw the ribeye on the table and took off before we could ask him for anything else,and never came back to see how the food was.We usually tip 20% or more,his loss.2 stars.
We  would go back but hopefully we  get a better server."}
{"text":"Server was great, atmosphere was nice & classy, food was tasty our first time here. Celebrated our daughters 27th bday dinner. Bacon wrapped shrimp was delish. Surprised creme? rasberry brulee was the bonus. We will return to celebrate more milestones."}
{"text":"I was just visiting visiting but absolutely fantastic the beautiful hostess was nice and inviting the service was great. I worked at T Prime Rib grill in the Eldorado Reno for 2.5 years and enjoyed the living hell out of it. Steak was fantastic thanks guys very good food"}
{"text":"Hidden gem! Food tasted amazing including the sides. They also have a delicious soup & salad bar with a huge selection.  Also very happy that the service was great."}
{"text":"Good dinner with family. We enjoyed a glass of vino and dad had a couple frozen margaritas. Instead of aides we decided on the salad bar and soups. Nice salads with chilled plates and plenty of options and dressings. The soups were chicken noodle (delicious, had two bowls) and an unmarked mystery soup like pasta e fagioli. The bread came and was sour dough loafs and pretzel bread sticks served with butter. 

For entrees we ordered the filet mignon and salmon filet. The steaks were both very good and he salmon filet broiled just right served with lemon.

For dessert they brought out a nice Birthday treat of creme brûlée topped with blackberries and strawberries. The plate had Happy Birthday written in chocolate sauce.

 A nice time had by all. The server was attentive and helped us with any needs. Thank you Krystle."}
{"text":"Best service in town. Jude is the epitome of who server should be. Personable and knows her guest. Always treat us like family. And the food always speaks for itself. One of my faves in Las vegas."}
{"text":"Since one of our favorite prime rib places closed, we've been trying to find a new one.  My family goes to Boulder Station all the time, but never tried the Broiler room.  I'm so glad that we did!   The Broiler has that \"old school\" Vegas look to it.   First the have a self serve salad bar with two kinds of soups.  Yes, I did say self serve, so if you want something fancier this isn't the place for you, but trust me you will be missing out on some really good food.  Speaking of food, the prime
Rib is amazing nice and tender.   I've had other family members order the porter house, salmon and a filet and all very delicious.   The staff have all been very friendly too!   Reservations or not required but suggested.  You can call in or do it online.  Glad we found our new prime rib spot!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a number of times, we've been there often for Thanksgiven Dinner and it's always good.  The food is always cooked to perfection and the service is outstanding.  What makes this place good is the salad bar, everything is fresh and fulling."}
{"text":"One of the best steakhouses in Vegas you won't be going in for the salad bar but when you leave that will be one of the things that you will definitely remember if you can ask for Kathy she will steer you in the right direction for that night you have a great time."}
{"text":"Fabulous fish!! My father & I are on a road trip back home to Oregon. Due to my terminal cancer I have a ridiculously difficult diet. Chef Jay went out of his way to accommodate me. He met me in the lobby so chat about my diet to see if their kitchen had the correct food. We found one item that would work but he had to cook it a special way. I had the sea bass on special that night. Best fish I've ever had!!!!! We're seafood snobs coming from Oregon. My dad is a fisherman. It is incredibly difficult to find places I can eat. I always feel horrible about being difficult but they made our night perfect. The best meal I had on my trip. Thank you"}
{"text":"It may not be in a trendy new casino or have a one hit wonder \"celebrity chef's\" name attached to it but what really matters to me is food quality and service.  You get both here in equal quantities at The Broiler located within the Boulder Station casino.

Want a nice steak that is actually prepared to the proper temperature without breaking the bank?  You've come to the right place. This is an old school style steak house...dimly lit and dark red leather booths; no flash, no fuss, no douche bag DJ playing lame tunes from his iPod so loud you can't hear the people at your table.  What you do get is great service and a very nice meal.  For 32 bucks you can get a steak filet oscar style; and that comes with a very nice soup/salad bar.  The salad bar is always fresh and the plates are chilled.  Wine prices are respectable and won't hurt your bottom line either.

In a city where everyone thinks you must pay $$$$ and be at the trendy spots to have a nice steak this is a refreshing break.  Good food, steaks seasoned and prepared properly, great service.  As far as steak houses go this place is a win."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on Monday evening around 5:45 PM for a reservation for 10 people.  We were seated in a private room, which was very nice because my cousin knows a few of the people who works there.

They have a salad bar up front so you can pick and choose what you want from there once you place your order at the table.  I went and got some olives and sliced cucumbers so I looked like I had some kind of vegetables on my plate.  Although, I did sprinkle bacon all over my veggies, so I'm not sure if they would still be considered as veggies by that time.

For starters, I ordered the crab cakes because I enjoyed the ones we had at Grand Lux Cafe so much, but we came to find out that it wasn't even close in comparison so we were pretty disappointed.

I ordered the queen's prime rib which is a 12oz, instead of the king which is a 16oz steak.  I asked to have my steak cooked medium rare, which it was.  The prime rib was well prepared and tasted much better compared to the crab cakes.

Auntie Bev had the 6 piece oysters on half shell as her appetizer and an order of oyster rockefeller as her entree.  I am not an oyster fan so I told her I didn't want to try them.  She said she preferred the raw ones over the rockefeller because the rockefeller  ones weren't too tasty.

Auntie Ann ordered the escargots as her appetizer.  I tried a piece and it was quite salty.  Although, I've never had it anywhere else before so I don't have anything to compare it with.  She had the crab legs as her dinner and she seemed to kind of enjoy it, but I had too much to eat already so I told her I wouldn't have any.  Everyone else seemed ok with their meals, I guess.

We decided to order the creme brûlée for dessert.  Auntie Ann finished one to herself, while Auntie Bev and I shared one.  I guess we were all in the creme brûlée mood this trip.  Their creme brûlée was probably the best thing from our meal.

Honestly, since Vegas offers so many choices when it comes to fine dining, I wouldn't make my way out here for the food."}
{"text":"We went mainly for a light dinner. We both decided on the salad bar. We both ordered appetizers. We both had a glass of wine.  Kenny, our server, was not attentive at all. We asked the \"back waiter\" for more bread. We never got it.  Empty dishes remained on our table until Kenny brought us the check.  The calamari was hard and chewy. The manager came up and asked us how everything was. We told him about the calamari. He just said \"oh I'm sorry, then walked away. The food is usually very good there.  We remembered Kenny from the last time we ate there.  He has a bit of an attitude. Maybe a better spot for him is as a dishwasher. Then he wouldn't have to deal with the public."}
{"text":"OMG - I think I just went back in time to the 1980's but fell like I sat at CUT!!!

The decor is terrible, the location inside the Palace Station is pretty awful and the only reason I went in with my fiance is because the wait for oysters was over an hour...

As a side note we hit the oyster bar about every other week as we live just across the ways, that may change after this visit.

 There are many elements to a great meal and of course food is number 1 on the list but bad service can ruin even the best of meals. It can also persuade you to return if you had a bad lot. So I will go down on record as having the best waiter and bus person ever. Oscar is a complete delight, he is efficient, on the ball and in my eyes the BEST WAITER I have ever had. This man should be courted by some of the finest restaurants in town, he is that good. The only one close is Israel @ The Barrymore. He makes the trodden down Broiler come alive, I cant remember the last time I tipped 30% +. And the lady making sure the iced tea glasses where never empty is as sweet and my fiance likes her tea.

Food - Dozen oysters (9 out of 10), crab legs (7 out of 10), salad bar (7 out of 10), bone in rib eye (10 out of 10).

Salad Bar was a surprise for $3 you get the same chowder as at the oyster bar and they are smart in the sense they know they aren't that busy. Why smart? Each of the salad bar offerings is put out in very small amounts, enough maybe for 3 to 6 people at any given time. This ensures that while they do not put out the most glamorous offerings, what they do put out is extremely fresh and even the plates are in a chill box.

Rib eye - OK so here is the the most amazing part...Oscar recommended the steak and i ordered medium rare. Incredible flavor, cooked to perfection and overall one of the best steaks I have had in a very long time. Worth every penny of the $37 I think I paid.

You can't beat a couple of cold beers, some oysters, a great steak and the company of a beautiful lady...hard to top!

To the \"The Broiler\" I say thank you for a pleasant surprise, to \"Oscar\" I say a heartfelt thanks for making the evening far better than I expected it to be, Stations Casinos is lucky to have you and they need to get you in their commercials!!!!

And to the ice tea lady, don't change, the tea would be nowhere as sweet without you.

We will be back

Happy Holidays

PS. I hope this review finds it's way back to Oscar, somehow, someway!"}
{"text":"Host & Server Carlos IS The Man! He is naturally charming and superb with customer service. You MY Friend are greatly appreciated!  Carlos deserves the full 5 stars along with the decor and ambiance of The Broiler.  

The food was perfect once they corrected the overdone filet mignon and lobster tail.  Initially I requested medium-rare for the filet and it was well done. My lobster tail was also well done. How do you do an injustice like that to both items.  Anyways, they cooked it excellently the second time.  We will be back for sure as long as Carlos is working there! :)"}
{"text":"We stopped in here this evening for my mothers birthday.

The staff was friendly unfortunately none of us were overly impressed with the food. It was okay but for well over a hundred I expect a little more for my money.

The salad bar was great! Should have just had that. Also the baked potato was very good.

The prime rib was very dry and tasteless. The cheese cake crust was burnt. The seafood platter was a deep fried mess.

At least my mom seemed to enjoy the salmon.

Again nothing was horrible but at the same time nothing was great."}
{"text":"I've learned my lesson before not to go to many restaurants in station casinos. I was starving and somewhat desperate so I decided to try \"The Broiler\", one of the biggest mistakes of my life. We first have to wait 20 minutes to be seated (not too bad), but once we actually get to our take it took our waiter 10 minutes to even greet us and 15 more minutes to bring us our beverages. Finally when we got around to ordering I decided to get the porterhouse steak and the lobster Mac and cheese. I specifically ordered it to be crusted with blue cheese and cooked blue(under raw) with two different sauces on the side. I also got the salad bar which it was nothing special. The soup tasted like something from a soup can. So as I'm eating my soup and salad, my mac and cheese comes out shortly after....I'm eating and still waiting for my steak assuming it was coming soon since I wanted it served with my mac and cheese.  50 minutes later my steak is still not in my belly, nor on my table...so I flagged down the waiter which didn't even come near our table for at least 20 minutes. Once I told him how long we've been waiting her rushed to the kitchen. Brought me out a luke warm medium rare steak with no blue cheese and no sauces. This was seriously the worst service and experience I've ever had at a steak house. I would rather lick up roadkill off the street before stepping foot into this restaurant again."}
{"text":"the steakhouses one of those best kept secrets in Las Vegas. You can dyeing their perfection at the price that you paid at more upscale places on the Strip. The food is always very good. The service is always excellent. And if you have a Players Club card you can often find coupons to dine in there for $25 off. So you could not beat the deal."}
{"text":"Excellent Steakhouse at this price point.

All of our steaks were cooked to perfection and well seasoned.

At first I thought a salad bar in a steakhouse was a bit odd.  However the salad bar is very fresh and had some great items.  I really liked it.

All of the steaks were priced $20-$30 and sides were only $3.  All meals include the soup and salad bar."}
{"text":"I dined at The Broiler around 8:30 on Tuesday, January 30th 2018. I just wanted to say that the food was excellent and the service was UNBELIEVABLE! My server was Katherine and she was so kind and so professional and her recommendations and descriptions of the menu were pin-point precise and she made me, a first-time customer, feel right at home and was honestly the best server I have ever had in the four years that I have lived in this town. The manager on duty was Pascal, I believe his name was, and he too was very kind and professional as well and the hostess was also very sweet and accommodating. This place is going to be new go-to place because it has the total package: Complimentary Unlimited Soup & Deluxe Salad Bar, delicious fresh-baked bread and top-quality meat and the cherry on-top, this place is perfectly priced. I can not wait to dine here again, this place with it's excellent food and sensational service is the standard that all other restaurants should strive to model themselves after, thanks again, see you guys next month! Mike!"}
{"text":"Very friendly servers and staffs! If you go... ask for Cathy or Kenny. AYCE salad bar and soup. The seafood combo are not pan seared anymore.... its just all battered."}
{"text":"We came for the oyster bar and the long line was a drag and the strong smell of cigarettes was making me nauseous so we decided to go into the neighboring restaurant \"The Broiler\". I assumed the casino might get its sea food shipment from the same place since both places are feet apart. Boy was I wrong.

Two people in my party got sick from the oysters. The Clam Chowder was so gritty it was inedible, my hamburger was dry and smelled old. To top it off a bill for two people is about $70 you can go to a really nice restaurant for $15-20 a plate in Vegas.

AVOID THIS PLACE. IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY AND YOU MIGHT GET SICK."}
{"text":"The wait staff was very nice. However, they served our meal to someone else. Also ordered a beer and it was non alcoholic. Dinner took forever to get. The salad bar was good. The waiter had the meal comped. They were nice to us."}
{"text":"Amazing service, delicious food and awesome atmosphere... Our drinks were never empty and we were taken care of at all times... Asked if they gave military discounts and they don't,however, they brought us dessert with \"Thank You\" written with chocolate sauce on the plate.. Thank you for a wonderful dinner!"}
{"text":"I was really wanting their crab cakes but after waiting 15 minutes at the table and not a word being said to me take a drink order or anything I got up and walked out. This like all other things station need to lose their customers and close!"}
{"text":"Love it here. Great place for a date and yummy steaks. If you want a nice date night then go gambling at a local spot, this is the place!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  Same ownership as Green Valley Ranch (Hank's) and Sunset Station (Sonoma Wine Cellar) I have been to Hank's and Sonoma and neither can hold a candle to the food or service delivered at The broiler.  Salad bar is always being refreshed with good salads and always has 2 different soups.  I always ask for a server named Kathy, as she is fabulous, but the others are very good and all have been employed in this position for some time.  Area while not the best, you have no issues parking in the parking lot and walking in as security is always present.  If you want a great meal at off-strip prices, but with great service and food, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I used to love coming here. But the service quality has certainly gone down. Judy is the only server I recommend. The other employees seem bitter and gloomy. The hostess is very friendly. Food is delicious. But you'd have a better time in the Pasta Cucina next door :) mostly the same stuff, cheaper prices. However, money is not the issue. It is the service I care about, and this steakhouse lacks it in recent years."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the steak and sides very much. Get the garlic and cilantro sauce. Its absolutely to die for"}
{"text":"This is a little hidden treasure!! The food is great!! The prices are great!! Our server Jude is beyond awesome!! They are lucky to have her!! You can tell she enjoys her job and is very knowledgeable about wine and pairings!!"}
{"text":"Was very happy with the food, everything you would expect from a steakhouse except for the outrageous prices. Definitely more inexpensive than a restaurant on the strip, the main trade off being the atmosphere is less formal and its in a local casino. If fancy isn't a requirement then this is a great choice. We had filet, lobster, and scallops, all of which were delicious. The soup and salad bar was a nice addition (included with all entrees) and the tomato bisque soup was exceptional. Dessert was a chocolate lava cake which was rich and perfect to share. Overall it was a great experience."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Stephen was our server and he was so nice and had great customer service! The food was beyond delicious and I loved the food portions. Normally with fine dining the portions can be really small but this place was so on point! Definitely worth the 10-15 min drive off the strip. Not to mention the prices were exactly what we were trying to spend. 
I got the salmon, and took Stephens recommendation with the oscar style topping and asparagus and my boyfriend got the surf & turf special which included filet mignon and lobster and he also got a side of garlic mashed potatoes, along with a glass of white wine and our entire bill came to 98 bucks, of coarse we tipped Stephen $20. so $118 for a bomb ass dinner you just can't beat in Vegas. Definitely would recommend"}
{"text":"Went here for Mother's Day Brunch.  My mother made reservations 12 days before asking for a table that was handicap accessible.  We got here and there was no table available.  They seated us at a booth across from the carving station.    My moms walker was in the way of other people walking by.  Was told by the manager Pascal (not sure of spelling) that there was nothing else available. There were a couple empty tables. He told us that those tables were reserved.    He was very rude and he said there was nothing he could do.  Not a good experience. The food wasn't as good either."}
{"text":"Have been eating here once a week ever since they brought Chef Jay back to run the restaurant. One of the best chefs I've ever had the priviledge to know. His specials are \"to die for\". The salad bar is one of the best in town. The appetizers are delicious and large enough that I often order them as my entre' along with a side (you must try the roasted corn - just like Mexican street corn without the cobb). My husband loves the blackened salmon and the prime rib. Both Jude (Judy) and Kenny as well as Catherine have taken care of us and they're on the top of their game."}
{"text":"Trying to find a good steakhouse on the strip, we went on Yelp and saw this place and the high rating.  It is 20 minites off the strip at boulder station.  I cannot even explain how magnificent my ribeye was was bacon wrapped shrimp.  We had a party of 4 and everyone was extremely satisfied with the salad bar amd the meal.  Kristel was excellent and very fun."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and I will definitely come back! 
I love their raw oysters & filet mignon. Their desserts are also very delish!!
Not only are their food great, they also have superb customer service. 
Jude was an amazing server and their overall crew rocks. :)
Love loveee this place!!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here last week to check out Boulder Station, because well, it's one of the last Station Casinos I had yet to frequent.  Thursday night with no reservation I walked right up and was seated without a problem.  I went straight to the drink menu, skipped over the wines and ordered an aptly named Asian Persuasion martini.  It was wonderfully sweet.

I ordered the filet mignon, butterflied, medium.  It was to die for, to me the perfectly cooked steak.  It wasn't burnt on the outside and it was juicy and tender on the inside.  I unapologetically enjoyed every bite of it.  I didn't order any sides seeing that I was alone and I know they came family style.  However, if you order an entree here you can have the soup and salad bar, so for me, that was a better option.  I didn't get a salad but it looked well taken care of, instead I opted for a delicious cup of split pea soup.  Now I'm not a soup expert but I love split pea and this to me was very good.  It had huge chunks of ham in it and it was very thick.  They also gave me the traditional station bread basket.  

I can't tell you about their desserts because I was already pushing myself to finish the steak, but I can say that I will return to eat here again.  The service was good from the hostess that greeted me to the manager that came by to say hello.  I really did enjoy my meal."}
{"text":"How do you know your getting old? It's when you get exited when a steakhouse starts serving dinner at 4pm. This place is Palace Station's answer to \"fine\" dining. I like that it doesn't try too hard though. 
      The oyster bar is attached to it at one end and they share a kitchen, so all throughout dinner I saw servers running back and forth. The place was designed this way, so you know right from the start they weren't trying to be too fancy. 
     There are no table clothes or salad forks and forget about extra knifes for your bread. In fact if you don't want bread it's optional, my hubby and I had to ask for a basket. If you get a steak it actually comes with a side. If you need more than one, they are just four bucks. Service was mediocre, but the steak was pretty good.  The place is really inexpensive and even has a cheesy nautical theme.  
     \"Fine\" dining this place just ain't it, but the food is good, simple and fairly priced.  You can get in and out is less than an hour, and if your \"old\" like me you can get your dinner grub on at 4pm."}
{"text":"This place is so good. What to get when you go to a steak house? hmm! Well a steak plus the salad bar here is amazing and everything here is extremely fresh and the prices are extremely reasonable. Per person average price is $15-30 and could go up or down depending on what you order. This is possibly the biggest secret and surprise that you could find in the Vegas valley."}
{"text":"The Broiler is located inside Boulder Station Hotel & Casino.

My favorite inexpensive steakhouse in Vegas. It's on the opposite side of town but totally worth the drive.

They start you out with a basket of fresh baked breads. Save me one of the fresh soft baked pretzels!!!

Recommended entrees: Filet Mignon, King Crab Legs, Lobster Tail, Panko Crusted Shrimp. (You can order a filet then add any of the other items at a reasonable price.) Dinners include one family style side dish from at least a dozen choices. The baked potato is huge. Their creamed spinach is delicious. The sauteed mushrooms are heavenly.

The soup and salad bar has Just about anything you could imagine or want on a salad bar is there. Love the chilled asparagus. The tuna salad is tasty. Just don't fill up on the salad bar because there's a great meal coming!!!

Service is always outstanding. The staff is professional and attentive.

Looking forward to my next trip to Vegas for a stop at The Broiler."}
{"text":"We went for a late valentine's day dinner (this review is a month or so late, hey, I tend to procrastinate obviously). We were told to sit in Jude's section by a friend and boy, she did not disappoint! She was very sweet and very attentive. Tip: get the king crab legs. Do it."}
{"text":"Located in the Palace Station. The soup/salad bar in this place is sick and seams to go on forever, beware I filled up on it and could barely finish my steak. The clam chowder was great. The décor is nothing to write home about, but not to worry the food is very good and very reasonably priced. If you are in the neighborhood, stop in for dinner. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"My medium rare steak was cooked to perfection.. Prices were ok, but damn I wish you werent charged for each individual side.. Pretty good salad bar also.. The bread basket was so good I got ghetto and asked for a second one.. I'll go back everytime I get a We Luv Locals coupon so I can save some cash.."}
{"text":"Amazing food and excellent wait staff! 

Appetizers we had:
Calamari
Ahi poke- really good and a bit on the spicy side. But I would really recommend this! 
Escargot- too salty for my taste and they put a leaf on it that gave it a bitter taste

I ordered the petite filet mignon and king crab. I couldn't even finish it! The portions are very big and all entrees include an expansive soup and salad bar. 

Jude is an amazing server. She was very attentive, helped me pick an entree, and can work magic for you ;)"}
{"text":"So, hit up The Broiler Saturday night to see if it's a repeat stash place for weekends.   Since the Cortez Room and a Billy Bobs have gone away, trying to find a good, semi inexpensive steak place is kinda difficult in certain areas of town.   The service was very good.  Wait staff was always around for refills etc.  The salad bar is pretty good. Plenty of stuff to make a killer salad. I had the Queen's cut prime rib, medium.   Not too bad.   I will say that a portion of the prime rib, for medium, was very very rare. The overall taste wasn't too bad. The rest of the table had a new York steak, sea food platter, and some oysters.  Overall, everyone was satisfied. The overall bill was around $140 excluding tip.  Not necessarily a quick repeat,  but won't mark it completely off the list."}
{"text":"OK, good news first.  The pan roast is still the best you will find anywhere even though the price is now up to $17.99.  The bad news is that you can only get the pan roast now at the bar.  You can no longer order pan roast if you go inside the restaurant and sit down.  The wait is also excruciating.  I went there on a Wednesday night.  Not exactly a time where the casino is packed.  There was only 1 waitress and 1 cook for 18 seats.  I counted because I was standing in line for 40 minutes!  I just stood there and watch customer after customer get up and leave after they finished their meal but there was no one to clear out their plates and tell the next person to sit down.  It was hard for me to get mad at the waitress since she had to take all the orders, bring out all the drinks, take care of all the checks, serve soup & salad, and clear the plates.   So after 10 seats opened up, the waitress finally got around to seating the 6 people waiting in line.  Then, of course, there was another 20 minute wait for the food.  Total time waiting 1 hr 30 minutes.... on a Wednesday night!  If you want a good pan roast go here.  Just don't expect to get it very quickly."}
{"text":"This has been a tradition now for the past 3 years to bring my Grandfather here for Christmas dinner. We have for the most part enjoyed our experiences. This time it just was not the best experience. We had a reservation at 5:15, yet was still not seated until 6:15. I understand getting busy, but this tells me that you don't have enough staff, or did a poor reservation schedule you could not handle. Either way, it's not ok. 
We also had some issue with the food which they corrected. 
Our waitress was super nice and apologetic...her name was Jude. She informed her manager of our issues with food and wait time. 
The manager Jim was also apologetic and did try to make up for the problems by comping a potion of our meal. 
If it was not for the manager acknowledging our inconvenience and our great waitress, I would not have returned. 
I would give them another chance next Christmas, but I will make a 4pm reservation to ensure we are seated first. :)"}
{"text":"We decided to try something different as we have been to the Steak House at Sunset Station and had a great experience.  This is a place I would not return to.  The service was VERY VERY Slow, almost like the servers did not care and knew the food was below average.  Everyone other then the host spent a lot of time in the back instead of on the floor with customers.  

My wife ordered a vegetable which came with a Hollindase sauce.  The sauce was very bland and when we finally got our waiter to come back by our table, he took the sauce back and agreed it was very bland.  This is the way all the food was this night, no excitement or care put into the food at all.

It was almost like they were just going through the motions because they were still open but really had no desire to excel.  This is a place we will NEVER go back to or recommend to anyone.  Don't like saying this about a place, it has to be said.  Sunset Station has a much nicer place, service and they really care about the food at Sunset."}
{"text":"For being in palace station wow i was impressed the rib eye was great the salad bar could be a little betterbut the prices good but i agree a remodel should be in the near future but hey they are ony like 30 years behind and it does match for palace staion"}
{"text":"I came here solo because I had some free time and a gift card for station's. The waiter was named Kenny and he was pretty good except for the fact expressions tells all. He seemed a little weird about my ticket price. The busser Luis was on point. 
I had the escargot and I really enjoyed the presentation and the sauce was awesome. For a entree I had the seafood combo. I was kinda disappointed that it was all deep fried. Guess I expected more from a steakhouse aa far as preparation. 
The creme brulee was amazing. I am a huge fan of the dessert. 
I guess I expected more since I myself work in a Vegas steakhouse. Almost there just need a little something extra in the food and service. I might come back depending on the situation."}
{"text":"In the past the expansive soup and salad bar was included in the price of entrees, but a $3 surcharge has been introduced since our March 2011 visit.  We did not try any of the offered soups, but filled our plates with fresh salad ingredients and the bottled dressing.  We each ordered the bouillabaisse which included a copious amount of seafood in a just okay tomato based broth.  The medium spice level we requested turned out to be too spicy for my wife, but about right for me. The bill, including tax and gratuity, was $60.35, but by stacking a LVA $25 off a $50 meal coupon with a WeLuvLocals gift card, the bottom line was a more frugal $20.08."}
{"text":"Definitely \"our place\" here in Vegas.  Food is very good & although I'm not a big fan of salad bars -- theirs is excellent.  The staff is always acconodating with Katharine being OUR waitress.  And, oh -- btw, they're very reasonably priced for a steakhouse"}
{"text":"Boulder Station's steakhouse has gone up and down over time, but it is fortunately on an upswing right now. Since Carve at the Eastside Cannery has gone downhill recently and Billy Bob's is gone at Sam's Town, this is probably the best steakhouse on the Boulder Strip.

The Broiler has a nice classic steakhouse ambiance, with dark colors and low light. There are nicer places for a special occasion, but The Broiler is nice enough and romantic enough to serve for most people. The soup and salad bar takes away from the fine dining experience, but adds to the value.

The salad bar is one of the biggest pluses for this steakhouse, as the offerings are fairly high quality. You can load up a Caesar salad with all the topping you want, though it might fill you up before your entree arrives. I always get a huge scoop of their shrimp salad every time I come here, as it is delicious and the best offering at the salad bar. The chicken and broccoli salad is also very good, but the crab salad is made with imitation \"krab\", bleh... The soups are always good and their cream of mushroom soup may be the best I've ever had (unfortunately they only have it one day a week).

Their steaks are reasonably priced, in the $20 to $30 range, and they are fairly good, but none of them will blow you away. They will blacken the steaks and provide house made sauces at no charge, which is also a big plus. They have an excellent peppercorn sauce and Bearnaise. All meals also include the endless soup and salad bar, so even though they don't include a side dish this place provides some pretty decent deals.

If your not a steak eater their roasted chicken and salmon are fairly good to. The salad bar cost $14 ala carte, so if your not that hungry pay the extra $4 and get the chicken for $18 and take your entree home. The chicken is always juicy, even the next day, and my wife usually does this as the salad bar fills her up.

If you like to have a big salad and soup before your steak, this is the place for you. If you live nearby and want to go out for a decent steak or a special occasion, The Broiler is worth considering."}
{"text":"My friend and I waited 30 minutes outside the Oyster Bar and gave up the wait because we were, well, I was, starving!!! 

I have eaten at the Broiler many years ago and did not remember if I liked it or not. Anyways, we were greeted by our server, Oscar, immediately after we were seated. The place was kind of empty, but I didn't mind. 

Our drinks were served immediately, and we were brought this little basket of bread assortment. The whole wheat with grape bread was delicious! I could eat a whole basket of that by myself! 

We wanted oysters, so we ordered a dozen of the fresh oysters. The tiger shrimp cocktails and the steakhouse chopped salad. 

The oysters were very fresh - kind of small but fresh - and complemented with fresh grated horseradish. The tiger shrimps - I was not too crazy about since I have had better elsewhere. I would try the jumbo lump crab cocktail next time though. The chopped salad was amazing! The perfect amount of dressing and flavor! 

I will definitely come back to the Broiler and skip the wait at the Oyster Bar!"}
{"text":"I recommend this place it's my pops favorite spot he's a regular, The surf and turf filet and lobster tail is fine dining. Melted butter yum."}
{"text":"So we went here at 4:30, and the place was practically empty.  So the service was excellent.  The lady who seated was very nice to my daughter.  My daughter was all dressed up and very proud of herself and getting complimented just made her day.

The soup and salad bar that came with the entrees were very good.  Nice variety.  The crab cakes were delish.  The dessert was good.  I like my filet.  My hubby thought his steak was a little gristly.  We ordered mac & cheese, but no one really liked it.  The mash potatoes were yummy.  Decent price on the wines by the glass. 

I'd give them 3.5 stars, but you can't.  We'd go back again.  I think it was a little overpriced.  We ended up spending over $100 with our restaurant.com coupon.  I think this place is on par with Outback.  Better than Sizzler.

What really made them shine was the excellent service from all wait staff.   They actually deserved the included 18% pre-added gratuity."}
{"text":"Celebrated our wedding anniversary here last night and had a delicious meal. Steaks were tender and juicy.  Service was outstanding.  Thank you for making our meal one to remember!"}
{"text":"Came here after learning of a $19.99 crab leg special that they were advertising for all Station casinos during the month of May.  We were a bit worried that it would be just a small plate, but boy were we wrong.  Plenty of steamed crab legs that were just delicious!  The potatoes and corn on the cob that came with it were the reason the star was left off..quite plain.  Purchase the salad bar for just 3.99...it was really good but the clam chowder was maybe one of the best I have had in a long time.  The manager came over and said the special may run through June...if it does...go!"}
{"text":"Not bad, but over priced for Boulder Highway. Go to the steak house at Arizona Charlies instead."}
{"text":"Preface: This is largely a review of the soup & salad bar.

Those sneaky little coupons will get you every time. We ended up at The Broiler with a $15 off $30 purchase coupon. The hub had hoped he could try the pan roast or linguine with clams, but these are only served at the Oyster Bar. The coupon was only good for The Broiler, so in we went.

The interior reminded me of a dark Shoney's, kind of a mismatch for the prices printed on the menu. Service was slow, but they got the job done. The hostess was probably the hardest working one there. Props to her!

The menu is straightforward steak and seafood, but they do have the not often seen soup and salad bar. The menu describes it as fresh and bountiful, which you would expect for $16! They're just trying to upsell you into getting an entree, as it is only a $2 add on to the entree. But, show vegetarians some respect! 

Sadly, it wasn't exactly fresh or bountiful. The lettuce selection was romaine or spinach, and there was plenty of wilting action. The rest of the vegetables were okay, but when you start with substandard greens, your confidence is hurt. I was left with an overall impression that the selections were not fresh.

The breadbasket was decent. At first, I was excited to see pretzel bread, but the more I ate it, the more it just tasted like not so interesting dough. 

As for the soups, they had clam chowder and chicken noodle. The clam chowder was flavorful. I think the predominant spice was rosemary. I could be wrong, but it was a powerful taste. I liked it, but it might not be for everyone.

Overall, I was disappointed. Bobby seemed happy with his trout and ginormous sweet potato (literally 3x the size of a normal one). Me: I had honestly been excited to see a $16 salad bar. I had visions of grandeur, but after my visit, I am thinking that Jason's Deli is the deal of the century!"}
{"text":"After going there for a number of years, we took our out of town guests last weekend. Worst meal ever! Prime Rib and Lobster, Prime Rib dry...awful!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I have dined here in 4 weeks. It is GREAT !! The filet mignon was cooked to perfection and tender as all get out, my husband had Porterhouse and it was super. We tried a few appetizers, the shrimp cocktail is great (huge shrimp & fresh) The lobster Bisque was not so great (but that's just my taste , as my fiance gobbled it up). The salad bar is wonderful, very large variety of items and nice soups. One could fill up on just the salad bar & a appetizer !! The service is great as well. I will be going here regularly for sure. They also have a special of 4 different entrees plus soup&salad bar for 24.99... I am going to try that next visit. I love this place !!"}
{"text":"Our family went on the 11th for my mother's birthday, and the service was excellent! The food was really good. I think my favorite was the cream of mushroom soup at the salad bar. The service was prompt and as an added bonus after our meal the staff brought a creme brulee out,with Happy Birthday written in chocolate! I'd definitely come back here for another special occasion!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my dinner and it was a nice size serving,  The variety at the salad bar was interesting and good it included soups which was very tasty.

The waiter, Marco, who was very interesting just to chat with, was friendly, helpful and so very nice, next time I'm in town and eat here I am asking for him, he made my evening.  Marco gave our party of 4 excellent service.

Now, the sign outside was misleading because it did not state that the special pricing on the beef dinner did not apply to dinners on Saturday or Sunday, but Marco made paying full price okay.  I wish I could pick 2 reviews A-OK and Yay I'm a fan."}
{"text":"I have been to the Broiler off and on over the past few years.  My meals have ranged from good to really good.  The way I eat has also changed quite a bit over those years.  From eating like a fat kid to eating clean and restricted.  This place gives you the opportunity to do both.  The salad bar has been touted as being the best on the Boulder Strip (not sure if that says a lot) and the prices are comparable to the other steak houses in the area.  So, to start off my review: I'll give you the reason we came here this night.

I have family in town for the Easter / Spring Break and in \"celebration\" we went out to dinner.  We, as most families are, never can agree on where to go and what to eat.  So, when all else fails, a steak house is the most agreeable place to go.  

*Side note:  This is my 3rd steak house that I have been to in the last 3 weeks and earned me the MEATHEAD BADGE here on Yelp!

And, as I have stated in previous reviews, we eat early.  Our reservations were made for 5:30 P.M. on Saturday, March 24th.  And, per our family, we show up at 5 pm.

**2nd side note: In my family if you're 15 minutes early, you are actually 15 minutes late.

- We meet my family in the restaurants waiting area.  Where we are immediately seated at a nice spacious table.  Plenty of room for the 7 of us.  The table was set up very nice and the atmosphere was pleasant as well.  It was lit well but still had an ambiance that you could have a romantic dinner here, if the occasion ever came.

- As we were checking out the menu, and after our drink order was taken, we were feasting on the complimentary bread.  The best pretzel bread ever, by the way. 

- The majority of our table went with the $25 special they had going.  You could choose: prime rib, filet, chicken or salmon, which comes with a side of green beans.  It also gives you access to the A.Y.C.E. salad / soup bar and a dessert (either a piece of Lemon Cake or Chocolate cake).

- We took advantage of the salad / soup bar.  The chicken gumbo was great.  A little too spicy for some but perfect for me.  

- The meal came out shortly.  I can only comment on the Prime Rib.  It was a little tough and had some cartilage issues.  But, it was still cooked to order and edible.  I wasn't a huge fan of the green beans but that is par for me. 

- Dessert soon followed and the presentation was awesome.  I wanted to take a picture but I got a little too gun-ho and just jumped into it.  But, take my word, it was presented well and it tasted even better.  The dessert took the experience from 3 stars to 4 stars for me.

And, our waiter... John P. (I think that is his name... if not, I'll look at the receipt later and edit) was awesome as well.  He knew his stuff and was patient for those of us who are a little picky.  He was able to answer questions and was very witty.  He wasn't over the top, as some waiters can be.  So, he added to my 4 star rating as well."}
{"text":"This place is probably more like 3.5 stars.  I wouldn't say its awesomely wonderful because the quality just isn't like the other steakhouses in the other casinos.  However, it is massively inexpensive compared to those steakhouses.  This was truly a bargain.

Husband and I came here before a comedy show at Bonkerz, and I had the steak and lobster special for 24.99.  It came with a baked potato and their salad bar, which was an insane amount of food for the price.  I ordered my sirloin medium rare, and it came back medium but I didn't really care.  It was cooked well but it wasn't massively tender like the sirloin special at Ellis Island which I preferred.  However, the lobster tail was a real treat, as it was roasted perfectly.  The salad bar was wonderful, and we really filled up on it.  The clam chowder they serve was memorable.  The bread was also very good.  My husband had the NY steak and liked it but was walking around in pain from having salad bar before his meal.  His meal came with mac and cheese which came in a really huge bowl that could have been for 2 or 3 people and was way too much food.

I wouldn't go out of my way to go here as there are probably equally good places in the Henderson area where I live, but for a before a show meal it was very good.  They also take restaurant.com certificates so it is an even bigger bargain."}
{"text":"PAN ROAST FTW!!!

In our hard economic times I still am able to scrounge up some money to make the drive from LA to Vegas to get me some Pan Roast.  This is a must eat in vegas.  Words cannot describe how filling and good this thing is.  You have shrimp, lobster, crab and rice...what more can you ask for as an asian?  I'd strongly recommend sharing this dish with 1 or 2 ppl.  Its HUGE!

The service is really good too once you're seated.  I personally enjoy eating at the bar, something about it just enhances the overall experience.  The chef Bob is a pretty funny guy too.  Really friendly."}
{"text":"Had not been to the Broiler for years. We used to make this place a stop for dinner when we were LV tourist. Noticed a commercial for a prime rib special( $14.99) and it jogged our memory and we jogged.....well not exactly.....we drove over for a very nice meal at a great price. We did the 14oz prime rib special that came with their above average salad bar, mashed potatoes, broccoli and a basket of bread. I also had a very nice flight of wines for the bargain price of $10. Overall prices were very reasonable and the sides were only $5. which is a bargain for a LV steakhouse. A terrific restaurant with a nice soft ambience at a decent price. Will def put this place on our steakhouse rotation though it is a jaunt from Summerlin. Def worth the drive.So ono."}
{"text":"Interior looks sad and outdated, fitting the theme of the casino it's located in.  Ordered the surf & turf, which is the filet and lobster.  All entrees come with a trip to the soup and salad bar, so got a few vegetables and the clam chowder.  Soup was really gritty, they should try to wash the clams out better.  When the food came, it was pretty obvious that the steak I got was previously frozen, as the texture was dry although cooked medium rare.  I'm pretty sure the steak I got was only USDA Choice or Select, the types you can get in any supermarket.  For the price, you'd really expect that it would be Prime.  Also, the lobster while large was rubbery and tough, not like fresh juicy lobster which I also expected.  I can imagine the field day Robert Irvine or Gordon Ramsey would have with this place on their tv shows.  Its only saving grace was the service, as Oscar my waiter was attentive, fast and really friendly."}
{"text":"Very good food here. I had the bone-in filet and it was cooked to perfection.  Hands down, this place has great food.

I also have to comment on the service.  I don't recall our servers name but he was outstanding. I'd like to thank the Broiler, the service and Boulder Station for a great evening!"}
{"text":"Been coming to this location to this restaurant for many of years and always sit in Kenny's section.
We celebrate holidays, birthdays & anniversaries. My family & I   have never ever had bad service or a bad meal. Mya steak has always been cook to perfection. The salad bar is just perfect!
We continue coming because everybody treat you like family when you walk in.

Thank you to all the staff at the broiler!"}
{"text":"My family and I came here for a birthday dinner. We brought the kiddos, there were 4 toddlers with us, the rest all adults. The hostess had informed us twice before entering \"you do know this is a steakhouse, right?\" After that I already had mixed feelings about how our experience would go. And to my surprise, ha! - I was right. It was not how we had expected the night to end! Our service was very bad. And not to mention our food, it was to be completely honest, boring at the very least. There was no presentation in our entrees which all were pricey. You'd expect it to be dressed up nicely on their plates, but no you won't get that here. This restaurant lacked culture and customer service. When I dine at a steakhouse, that's what I would expect from their end, to get an above and beyond experience. So no, I definitely will not be coming back here in the future. If you're happy with all things 'ordinary' then I suppose this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"This well kept secret in the not-so-good neighborhood is outstanding ( Boulder Station Casino)!  Service ( Steven) was on point ( they don't make waiters like him anymore- we really appreciated his skill)..........food was fabulous.........salad bar was INCREDIBLE!  What a great Date Night this was..........best since we moved here 2+ years ago!  It is a must-go to for all locals! And we even won some money on the fun slots they have there! Worth the drive and even the crazy street people! We'll be back, that is a sure bet!"}
