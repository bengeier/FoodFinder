{"text":"Great experience tonight! Cozy and live performance, couldn't be better. Food and price also amazed me,  makes want to come back next time for the live performance. Defenitely check this place out."}
{"text":"Good food at a reasonable price. Amazing pastas for a Bar and Grill place."}
{"text":"You must try the burgers here. We thought they were so good. So far, the best we have tried in Richmond Hill. They are in house made patties, not frozen, tender and juicy. Seems to be a chuck cut I believe. Just how I like it. Next time I'll try the wings and repeat back."}
{"text":"Twice I've come here after a ball game at Richmond Green to find them closed an hour early. The sign says 11, but at 10 they are closed, lights out, chairs up and not a soul in sight.   They're supposed to be our league's unofficial sponsor so you'd think they'd know people Might come by on a Tuesday."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday afternoon for lunch. Place was not that busy. One waitress running the whole place.  Although I have never been to Stein Burger I do like what they have done to this place. Nice open space with two projectors for big screen TV viewing.   Yogi's deluxe burger $14 - beef patty, pulled pork, peameal bacon, regular bacon and crispy onion strings. Added $2 to get sweet potato fries. The burgers sounds great on paper but the outcome was just okay for me. I found the burger to be dry. The pulled pork was almost non-existing. There was so little pulled pork that I didn't even taste that it was there. Bacon and onion strings were nice and crispy. Overall, it fell short of expectations it still tasted good. The added yam fries were nice and crispy and comes with its own sauce.   Wing and rib combo $22 - the meal comes with fries and coleslaw. We got Cajun wings which had a nice crispy on the skin. Inside the wings were nice a juicy and they were quite large in size. The ribs were very small but nice and tender.   Overall, a great place to get some bar food.  3.5 stars"}
{"text":"This location has gone through a few name changes over the years. It was a Wild Wings if I'm not mistaken, then the next one was a terrible copy cat of Wild Wings and that was the last time I ate there until it became Yogi's Bar.  I've had the chicken wings and the pizza here. Both really good. I've been recommending this place to everyone lately. Wing specials on Thursdays and Sundays I'm pretty sure.   Live band Saturday, open mic Sunday... Come check it out."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place since it was named Stein Burger.  The menu has changed slightly since it was known as Steinburger, but you can still get most of the items you loved from the old menu.  Their Veggie Burgers are without a doubt the best veggie burger you can get in the GTA.  They make it in-house and it has a fantastic texture that doesn't taste like the mush other pubs serve as their veggie burger.  Their fish tacos are also fantastic!  They do have daily specials that make the trip even more worth it.  Since the renovations, the space feels much more open, however all the TVs have been moved to behind the bar.  I liked the old setup where there are TVs positioned all around the restaurant instead.  Great little restaurant if you're looking for good quality pub food."}
