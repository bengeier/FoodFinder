{"text":"After several years of dining at this establishment, I will not be going back. Food quality has been noticeably altered in the interest of increasing profits. Portions are smaller and soup or salads are extra charge items. That would be fine if all else remained at the past quality levels, however that is not the case. Service has also gone downhill due to a lack of servers. once again a cost cutting device that has unfortunately backfired. Too bad!"}
{"text":"For some reason my parents like to eat there and my mother dragged me along once again. When we got there there was only one other table of customers yet it took them ten minutes to bring us water. I ordered the soup and it was bland and tasteless and the bread they brought was cold and dry. I had the pork schnitzel which was very greasy. The whole experience there was terrible as usual. I told my family i never want to go back there again. The food was lousy but the service was even worse. I have to say however they do a much better job when they have banquets there. I was told there were different cooks for the Croatian lodge part of the operation. I would recommend staying away from the restaurant altogether but if it's a wedding there it's safer."}
{"text":"I'm drawn to Cevapi like moth to flame. These were good. I'm the grandson of Eliis Island era Croatians and this food tastes like food the old timers would approve of. The look and feel of the restaurant is classic middle European...think Swiss chalet fondue places. I came in 30 minutes before closing and no problem. I will return when in the area."}
{"text":"Sad face...this used to be one of my favorites. As I understand it's under new management? They redid their menu, which I totally get that updates/changes are sometimes needed. I also get trying to get a broader audience with adding some new interesting dishes (chicken paprikash pierogis). However, this time I had a really hard time even finding something or order, as every item I used to get is now not on the menu. I usually got the goulash, and it was fantastic. Nope, gone now. My second go to item were the cabbage rolls. Also gone. However, I saw that on a sampler platter they were one of the items. So I asked the waitress if I could just get the cabbage rolls (which she corrected me to say \"stuffed cabbage\"). Sure. When they came to the table they were SMALL. And I mean teeny tiny. Before I could barely get through one, and this time I ate both. They were probably 2.5 inches long and 1.5 inches wide. I get that they're part of the sampler platter, but if they're ordered as an entree then perhaps compensate with a third. They were also SALTY, and I usually add salt, I mean I drink pickle juice straight out of the bottle and even I thought these were aggressively salty. Super bummed since I used to love coming here."}
{"text":"Good food. Love the schnitzel. Their new menu is delicious and you can still order things off the old one."}
{"text":"Very good homemade cabbage rolls, and chicken cordon bleu. Excellent potatoes. Very kind, friendly and helpful staff. Apple strudel was awesome."}
{"text":"Finally visited after years of wanting to. Dated decor & poor service - I had to rely on girl bussing tables to take care of us after plates were served. Food was very  good & reasonably priced. Minor complaint - would have preferred homemade bread in an ethnic restaurant rather than day old Italian. Will return but hopefully w/ a more attentive server !"}
{"text":"Great homemade food! Always love eating here! You get a lot of food for your money too!"}
{"text":"Best crepes this side of town. Good meat sampler plates. Loved and enjoyed by other Eastern Europeans."}
{"text":"Food was delicious!  Recently went to a rehearsal dinner in a room off of the restaurant and the setting, food and service was all great.  It was traditional Slovenian food for our menu, so not sure even what the restaurant menu had.. Either way, it was delicious!  They also had a wedding going on that poured over into our space, and they were quick to corral and get the wedding guests out, including not allowing them to drink at our open bar - It was very much appreciated!"}
{"text":"Great restaurants great cuisine great service and hard to find, so look under the white awning on the side of the building."}
{"text":"I have got to say my family, and i come here a lot. which we were just here last weekend, and i must say you can still order off the menu, and no its not a child size portion. my mother got the chicken cordon blu which it isn't on the menu, but they still gave it to her, and its adult size. the food here is great i love when we come here. i would like to try their fish, but always last minute i change my mind, and get my usual. i saw some negative reviews about this place, but i am certain nothing has changed since they got their new menus. the service is great we can't complain about that, and the food is very good. our server that we usually have is always on top of her game. its reasonable too its not over priced like some of these places that people go to. its very clean, and food is always good, if you're looking for a place to take your family, and not worry about food quality i suggest going here."}
{"text":"Great seafood platter grilled shrimp, white fish and scampi.  Very good.  Dubrovnik Gardens specialty is Croatian \"comfort food\", Sarma (aka Cabbage rolls), Cevapi (little grilled meat sausages), raznici (Croatian kabobs) and my wifes favorite Friday special is the the soup made with farina dumplings (much lighter than the more common potato or flour dumplings found in some Czech dishes).  One can also have a shot of the Croatian Plum Brandy, Slivovits or a Croatian Beer Karlovacko.  Not much can be said for the veggies, which is the only reason for my 3 star rating, otherwise I would have given them 4 stars  For dessert try the palacinka (aka crepes) with the chateau wine sauce (chocolate and nuts)... and top it off with Trkska Kava (aka Turkish coffee)"}
{"text":"it is what it is.  ethnic croation, cheap, mostly fresh, relatively fast, friendly, good for groups of old people and big loud families after funerals and such (like us) and little kids. nothing bad, except the frozen veggies on the side are kinda just there for filler it seems. but the main dish parts were basically good, healthy, tasty.  my mediterranean red snapper with olives didn't actually have olives. my cousin's shrimp and scallop fettucini didn't actually have scallops. but it was all good (except those frozen veggies as mentioned).  plus = full bar with decent slivovitz.   plus = yummy turkish coffee. my uncle loves the crepe deserts, i think they are ok.  Plus Plus = they also host proms here and we got to see a bunch of prom kids and some cute dresses and best of all i now know the latest official 4 prom poses (\"flirty\" with the girl kicking her leg up, \"traditional\" with guy behind the girl like spooning style, \"facing\" each other kind of holding hands, and \"romantic\" which is the same as facing each other but with the girl's hand pressed on the guy's chest.)  Talk about useful.  I wish i had pictures, but i'm not one for camera toting at funerals."}
{"text":"Food was excellent.  Prices very reasonable.  Waitress was very fun.  I had the Wiener Schnitzel and it was very good. My wife had the lemon chicken (it was the recommendation of the server) and she said it was the best chicken she ever had.  We had a group of 10 people. They take reservations, our table was ready, and the entire group loved the experience. We will be back."}
