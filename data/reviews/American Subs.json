{"text":"So I walk into american subs and to my surprise its run by Asians who talk about there dislike for rice and love for american food, and asked me if that's weird since there Asian? I wasn't sure how to answer there question outside of laughter, I must admit the lady was very funny, the get up seems like a small business, prices are pretty good bread is really thin but sandwiches are amazing I would recommend this place"}
{"text":"Used to be port of subs, now a mom and pops in the Walmart center.
I ordered 2 Italian subs w/2 macaroni salads and a drink (1), total was just under &20-wow and no pickle :-(
The portion was a bit more than a std sub and service girl was pleasant.
Cold cuts didn't seem like higher quality vs others.
As a mom and pops competing with major players like subway, port and Quiznos-you have to offer something different-maybe cooking your own meats? Different sauces? Choice of unique items vs typical chips...Etc. Etc.
Not sure place offers enough to keep them going, I wish them well but see a casualty in the future :-("}
{"text":"Decent. 
Got what seemed like a lot more meat on a sandwich than I would expect, however the bread is pretty terrible. 
Nice staff. If given the chance though I would go to subway before these folks. 
They advertise chili but never have it. 
PHANTOM CHILI!"}

Great sub shop! There was only one employee in here, I assuming she is the owner of this shop. She was very friendly and made recommendations on which is the favorite subs among customers. 
 
This place is set up like a NY Deli and has a nice variety of hot and cold subs. I got the hot pastrami with provolone. I thoroughly enjoyed my sandwich and will be back next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"I went in here 11/24/14 after just coming out of the Walmart in search of a quick bite, I was happy to find that they had a place to sit. I ordered a small Roast Beef which was $4.65 and if I had it to do over again I would not have willingly spent $0.65 on this garbage. The small sub was really about three bites worth which after taking just a single bite, I decided against consuming the rest and deposited it in the rubbish bin. I proceeded to take out my salad and juice that I bought at Walmart but when the girl at the counter saw me eating something other than what she had just prepared, I was asked to vacate and not return, the latter I will not do."}
{"text":"We were looking for a quiet, cool place to relax after a day of shopping. This was it! The sandwiches were delicious, with the meat and cheese sliced right in front of us. The sandwiches ended up way bigger than we expected. Other perks: ice cream, smoothies, and free wifi . 

We got the farm fresh veggie and pastrami/cheese sandwiches."}
{"text":"This little mom and pop shop is a little gem. The sandwiches were delicious and the staff was amazing! Order the hot pastrami and the hubby ordered the hot phillycheesesteak  both were very Delish and a lot better quality than what I've gotten at port of subs, subway and cappriottis lately."}
{"text":"The service is really nice, they talk to you while making the sandwich, which was pretty good. They use a lot of meat which I really liked. At subway its mostly bread and like the same price. I'd come here again"}
{"text":"Ma and Pa sub shop. I liked it a lot. Good quality meats for the price. They have ice cream too which is a nice change."}
