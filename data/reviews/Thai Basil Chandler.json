{"text":"great food and amazing staff they always remember me and how I need my orders to be when I call them in for work no complaints we eat here at least once a week"}
{"text":"Love the food here.  Been here a few times and got the peanut curry twice and been delish.  Thai iced tea was great as well.  Only been there during lunch and everything seems pretty good so far.  Went with coworkers and family and they all loved it too.  Service was fast, prompt and nice.  Will be back again to try other dishes."}
{"text":"I can't believe how fast their food comes out. It seemed like it only took ten minutes for me to start eating my Panang Curry after I ordered it. Create servers and good food for the price and for the time it takes to cook it."}
{"text":"Great lunch with coworkers. The food was good. I had the Fried rice with tofu. The service was great. Make sure to get there early to get a seat with a party more than 4."}
{"text":"this place is fantastic! a hidden gem in chandler! i'm in phoenix and hardly go to chandler, but thai basil is so good that i'm just looking for an excuse to be out that way again!"}
{"text":"This is the best thai food in town!! I have never eaten anything bad here and the eggplant with chicken is my favorite.  Great customer service as well, they get you in and out in time for a lunch hour lunch."}
{"text":"Love this place.... Anytime, me and my office buddies go out for lunch, this is the place I want to go to..
I'm a veggie person, and I just love their Thai Basil Fried rice!! 
AND... I love eating SPICY!! So, once in a while, I love taking the fried rice with the 5* spice level. Just love it!! Caution ppl, if you're having it for the 1st time, I'd recommend breaking into the 4* first, and then dig your way into the 5*...
The staff is courteous, and the ambiance is good....
Highly recommended for lunch outings...."}
{"text":"Here's the deal, I was torn between giving this place 4 or 5 stars and here's why.  First, the portions have grown (and so has my waist) since I first started frequenting this place.  Second, I (and any invited guests) are always spoiled by the staff; they're always helpful and prompt and the restaurant itself is clean and inviting.  Last but not least, they are quick; even during a busy lunch hour, our food was out before you could make a dent in your Thai Iced Tea.

Speaking of the Thai Iced Tea, it's sweet - just like I like it - yet you still get a hint of the tea with each sip (or slurp).  Actually, I wish they would use a frosted mug and forgo the ice so I could enjoy the refreshing beverage down to the last drop, instead of being greeted with a diluted concoction at the end of my meal.

The Papaya salad is fresh and light, and ordering it at a medium spice will initially give you a nice kick in the mouth without melting your face off.  The Ginger stir fry plate has a nice taste, and I would definitely recommend it if you're in the mood for a vegetable and rice plate.  The Pad Thai is good, but one thing I found is that the noodles were a bit too soggy - it would've been nice if they were just a tad more firm, although I must commend the kitchen for fully cooking the shrimp as I've been to some Thai places where the shrimp arrive a bit undercooked.

So is this the best Thai food I've ever had?  No, but this is a case where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts and the restaurant is definitely on my short list of good Thai places in my area.  Ultimately, the combination of the service, accommodations, and food is why I gave it a full five stars.  You'll also enjoy it if you're a big KYOT 95.5 fan since they're usually playing smooth jazz renditions of Outkast's 'I like the way you move'.  :)

If you plan on checking it out, I would recommend dropping by in the evening & early in the week as the restaurant usually has only 2 or 3 patrons enjoying a quiet dinner.  Lunch hours are usually busy as Intel's main campus is only a stone's throw away."}
{"text":"Lackluster at best.

The papaya salad had very little papaya and way more carrot and lettuce with a watery dressing that was way too sugary sweet and way too much of it.

Their signature dish, Thai Basil, was one of the most boring plates I've ever laid eyes on let alone eaten.  The primary flavor of the sauce it was served just reminded me of canned sweet and sour sauce with fish sauce thrown in for good measure.  Again too sweet also.

The green curry wasn't bad at  all, but then again it's hard to screw up coconut milk and curry for me.  It always tastes good.  Too much sugar probably here also, but for some reason it seemed to work since this one was a bit more spicy than the others.  I wouldn't get excited about this dish still, but it at least wasn't a complete disappointment like the others.

The service was unfulfilling also.  The young man was pleasant and was trying his best to solely manage the entire restaurant (about 8 tables on a Saturday lunch) and was doing an okay job at it.  But he (or the kitchen, not sure) apparently switched our requests on which dish was spicy or mild as it came opposite of what we requested.

Overall I can't believe this place gets any decent reviews.  A complete Yelp let down here.  Maybe it was an off day?  Maybe the cooks in the back were filling in for the regular chefs?  Maybe you should avoid a Saturday lunch here?  The only thing I'm sure of is I'm completely unmotivated to go back or recommend it."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant as a group of five. We found from their website that they have lunch menu \"M-F 11-3 Saturday 12-4\" 
http://www.thaibasilchandler.com/chandler_lunch.html
It was Saturday and when we arrived there, the waitress denied it. When we showed the website she still denied it after we drove all the way there. I asked that to be honored as it is usually done in USA restaurants and she still said she won't do it. What a rudeness."}
{"text":"Tucked in a quite plaza In Chandler AZ, is an un-assuming, little Thai restaurant with BIG flavor. Despite the lack-luster curb appeal from the outside, the inside is quaint and clean. 
Get things started with some spring rolls. The sauce isn't mind blowing, but those 6 dainty morsels of fried goodness have got some real flavors goin on. (especially when dipped in your curry)
I recommend their signature dish, \"Thai Basil,\" for those who haven't been here before. 
I prefer an extra spicy, KANG-DANG (red curry): Your choice of meat, simmered in coconut milk with bamboo shoots, bell pepper, broccoli, carrots, green beans and Thai basil, Served with jasmine rice.  

I will say, some menu items are hit and miss. So don't judge this place based on ONE dish you don't like. (You can find something you aren't going to like on every menu across the country). 
Friendly service, fresh ingredients, and an authentic \"je ne sais quoi,\" earn Thai Basil 4 stars. \"I'm a fan.\" 
Eat well, Live well, and surround yourselves with ones who do.  - Cheers"}
{"text":"I have been to Thai Basil dozens of times over the last few years.  I don't know why I haven't written a review, but I decided it is time.

The service here is excellent.  There are only a couple of servers that I've seen.  The female server (I need to ask her name) is amazing.  No matter how busy the restaurant is, she continues to provide attentive service.  Always friendly, she greets us with a smile.  She is usually there when we go and I feel immediately happy when I see her because I know our experience will be wonderful.  On occasion there is a male server (I think his name is Christian) and he's excellent too.

My boyfriend usually gets the roasted duck curry and he loves it.  The duck is tender and the sauce flavorful.  I have gotten the green curry with chicken which is always delicious.  Sometimes I get the crab fried rice and that is always a hit.  

We will continue to come here for our favorite Thai food and excellent service."}
{"text":"I have been saving my 100th review for my favorite restaurant of all time. 

We found Thai Basil over a year ago now and have been loyal customers, going at least once a week and sometimes more than that, since last July. Everyone who works here is super friendly, and they know us now and know what we like to order by heart. We just walk in now and they see us and say \"Spicy noodle, tofu, hot, right?\" Its pretty great having a place that knows my regular order. I have tried most of the menu items. The garlic eggplant is also pretty great. The thai basil is also amazing. I have generally liked everything I have had here except the curry. I never have had a good curry experience. Both of the times I ordered it I ended up with long black hairs in it (which they quickly replaced with a new order) but I just wasn't a fan. Maybe it's because of the coconut milk and it makes it too sweet. 

The spring rolls are also the best here out of every spring roll I have had anywhere. 

Before I went vegan again last year we also got the fried banana ice cream pretty often. That is pretty amazing. If you eat dairy, you have to try it at least once. 

Thai Basil is one of our regular spots to eat out, and we hope its here to stay for many more years to come. I don't know what I would do without my spicy noodles!!!"}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal at any Thai Basil, but especially this one on the corner of Rural and Chandler. I usually do take-out, but I have eaten in as well. The take-out experience has always been quick & easy - my order has always been waiting for me when I walked in. Nice, quiet dining in experience - soft music, some cool asian stuff to look at. Not usually very crowded - only real traffic seems to be the steady stream of people coming in to pick up to go orders. The curry dishes are delicious, and served in generous portions (especially when ordered for take-out). Courteous service & quality food. The spice factor seems a little inconsistent. They ask you how spicy you want it - I tell them the same thing every time, and sometimes it's really spicy and sometimes not so much.

My only real complaint - the hours. They close everyday between lunch and dinner from 4-5pm, which somehow always seems to be when the craving strikes. And they're closed on Sundays."}
{"text":"Food was horrible.  Way overpriced.  Not recommended at all!   Pad thai noodles extremely dry, chicken tasted reused.  Steer clear!!"}
{"text":"I come here quite often for lunch..it's always packed, but service is pretty quick...one of my gotos for lunch under an hour (assuming you get there by 11:30).  The staff is super nice...and always accommodating to vegetarian diets.  Their scale of spicy is pretty regular...( some places a 3 isn't always a 3). And the food is yummy! My goto favs are Thai basil, Garlic, and spicy noodle."}
{"text":"This is close to my work.  The food is always pretty good and the service is always friendly but frantic (seems like they are always short staffed).  I love their curries and should stick with those as they do them well.  I have also had their Pad Thai, Thai Basil and Drunken noodles dishes which are all pretty good.  All their meals come with a little cup of soup to start and a spring roll with the meal.  Definitely not fancy but the food is good."}
{"text":"great curry!!!  OMG.  cute little place.  service was good, except for our meals (2 of us) came about 5 minutes a part from each other.    Woudl have been a 5 star had they not screwed that up...and they did not comment on the mistake either...woudl go back for the food though!"}
{"text":"We've been to Thai Basil (this location and others) many times in the past, but we were very disappointed with our la experience. We got home to discover out take out order was wrong and there's was almost no flavor in any of our dishes. Disappointing!"}
{"text":"I've never actually eaten in the restaurant so this review is based solely on the food. I live fairly close to Thai Basil and always pass it on my way to Trader Joe's. I finally decided to drop in and order something to go. The lady at the counter was really nice and she gave me delish iced tea while I waited, free of charge. The place, itself, was clean and very quaint. There were about 3 tables being occupied. My food was ready in about 10 minutes. 

I took one smell of the food and I raced home to eat! I ordered the masaman curry with tofu and brown rice. They give you heafty portions...I had enough for the next two days! The curry was so good. The brown rice mixed in made it even better. It's not the best masaman I've ever had (I'm from Cali and I'm a snob, ok?) but it was very good. This is my new go to spot for thai."}
{"text":"I get my Thai food from here and so far I'm pretty satisfied. Costumer service is great and the food tastes good as well. They sure know how to make it spicy so be careful :)"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times and like the atmosphere, the decent food, and friendly service.  I, however, mostly get take-out here, and that is when I've been greatly disappointed.  It seems to me that the take-out portions have gotten smaller, but the prices are still the same, or maybe even higher.  Even if this is not true, the prices are too much for the amount of food I actually get.  Ordering Chinese from Hot Wok or making the five-minute drive to Thai-a-Rama is a better bet."}
{"text":"Worst food and smallest portion I've ever had at any kind of restaurant. I highly Don't recommend this place"}
{"text":"FanTastic!!!! 
Awesome!
Delish! 
We love thai food and this is a great spot!"}
{"text":"I stopped by for a late lunch and enjoyed it! I have frequented the Thai Basil in Phoenix several times during busy lunches and was craving the drunken noodles. Tasted very similar and hit the spot! The thai iced coffee was amazing! Would return for this combination again. Service was on par."}
{"text":"\"The food was excellent and the staff is very friendly. I would definitely recommend this place if you like Thai food. We had the red and peanut curry chicken, one of the best we have had and i travel alot. The restaurant was very nice and clean.\""}
{"text":"My coworkers and I come over here whenever we get the chance.  I really like that I can order online from work, then swing over and pick up my meal immediately.  My favorites are the pineapple curry and the drunken noodles.   The prices are good - especially for lunch - and it's always tasty and healthy.  Nice that there are so many gluten-free vegetarian options also."}
{"text":"Thai Basil in Chandler is in a beautifully decorated space in the strip mall, at the southeast corner of Chandler Boulevard and Rural Road. 

The food we had there was very tasty, quite a bit lighter/less starchy than my favorite Thai place (Swaddee Thai, which is, incidentally, just a mile up the street at Ray Road and Rural Road). The lunch special I tried was chicken noodles, while my husband had the Thai Basil signature dish with beef. Both specials came with a bowl of delicately flavored soup which was a welcome change from Swaddee, which offers a salad instead. 

The chicken noodles dish surprised me in its bright, homey chicken broth flavor. The dish was very comforting, packed with lots of different types of vegetables and moist chicken that tasted as though it had been brined before cooking. It was not made with the wide flat rice noodles I was anticipating, however. It came with a thicker type of noodle I haven't seen in most Thai restaurants.

My husband's Thai Basil was not quite as spicy as I was expecting, considering we ordered it Thai hot, but it was delicious nonetheless. It was reminiscent of a stir fry, with fresh, bright flavors and crisp veggies. The dish did not come with much sauce, so eating it with rice was a bit difficult.

I also ordered a Thai iced tea, which was wonderfully cool and refreshingly strong in flavor. None of that weak, watered down tasting Thai iced tea here!

Overall I would recommend Thai Basil. The restaurant is clean and pretty, the servers are friendly and efficient, and the prices are low for a lovely lunch or dinner special. Slightly less expensive than Swaddee Thai, but both restaurants offer such a unique interpretation of their signature dishes that it is worth it to frequent both."}
{"text":"As always I was completely satisfied with my meal. The staff are friendly and quick to provide you with everything you need to enjoy your meal.
I love the Chicken noodle #18.
Very clean and classy place without killing your budget."}
{"text":"The food is good if they can get your order right. 2nd time in a row they have screwed up my take out dinner order. I even confirmed my order this time when picking up (ordered no spice) and the guy said medium spice, and I said \"no, it should be no spice\"  and he said \"yes, no spice.\" Well, I take my food home and lo and behold, my food is spicy. Thanks for lying to my face dude. Makes me regret leaving a top."}
{"text":"I had the pineapple fried rice and the pad thai. The pineapple fried rice had a curry flavor with raisins and cashews. The pineapple slices were fresh and not canned. The pad thai had the brown sauce on it instead of the orange sauce I like have seen at other restaurants. The brown sauce seems to have a stronger fish sauce flavor. The chicken was not dry."}
{"text":"Food was great.  It was full of flavor and service was even better.  Very present and helpful.  I've enjoyed Thai food for years but some of my guest where newbies and the server was very helpful in disscribing the dishes. My guests felt right at home. ...pad Thai noodles where out of this world. .."}
{"text":"Got take-out yesterday from here. order a sweet and sour fish. They charged 9.95 for the sweet and sour dish, which is the sauce with a few vegetables, pineapple, and then charged $6.00 for the fish. This was unacceptable to charge so much for this small dish, with only 8 (8!) pieces of tilapia. Usually when I have order sweet and sour fish from other places, it comes with many fried nuggets of fish, so I was disappointed. The taste was fine. Also ordered broccoli with garlic sauce, that was custom made, and that was very tasty, but not that big a portion for $10. Ordered the crispy sweet potato, which came with four slices of sweet potato, although the potatoes were white.  It tasted fine, the dipping sauce was good, but disappointed it only came with 4 pieces of potato for $6. Imagine getting that many fries in a $6 order?  The service was pleasant and quick, but for these prices, Ill have to look elsewhere."}
{"text":"We went to dinner at this location the other night, after having been to the one on University Blvd a few different times now. Everything was alright but the food definitely didn't have the same flavors as the other place.

We ordered the Pad See Ew with chicken, the Massaman Curry with chicken, and Cashew Chicken. The Cashew Chicken was probably the best thing that was served. It sauce was flavorful (even though it was a bit on the salty side) and tasted good with the vegetables & side of rice. I ended up getting the Massaman Curry due to the recommendation of our waiter, but in hindsight, I probably would've gone with the Panang Curry instead. And just a note - even though we ordered everything at medium spiciness, it was a bit more towards the hot side, but we didn't mind.

We rounded out our meal with some dessert - the fried banana ice-cream. It was a huge disappointment and I will definitely never be ordering it again. The fried bananas were way too oily and not very tasty at all. The ice-cream was just okay, nothing special.

Overall, everything was just alright. There's another Thai restaurant just up the road that offers a more tasty selection of foods so I just don't really see myself going back here."}
{"text":"I love this place! The staff is always so friendly and welcoming - they don't make me feel rushed to order either which is always a plus! I have only had their Pad Thai and I'm addicted! Cannot wait to try other items on their menu :)"}
{"text":"Dined at this location tonight and had a terrible experience.  I had purchased a Groupon a couple months ago and drove 45 minutes from North Phoenix as it was only redeemable at the Chandler location only to have my Groupon denied.  The server couldn't find the clipboard that he is supposed to write them on and I had to pay out of pocket.  So basically I wasted 29.00 on a Groupon that I can't use.  Worst purchase ever.  I have never been treated this way.  Anywhere else the server would have taken down the voucher number and figured it out the next day with the Manager, instead I was punished for their lack of communication and organization."}
{"text":"Excellent green curry and the spring rolls are the best I've had. I like spicy and they offer it as \"medium hot\" etc. and you should be careful about going above medium!"}
{"text":"I usually eat at the Thai Basil on Rural Rd, just north of Main in Tempe for lunch.  My wife, who is gluten, soy, dairy, and sugar intolerant, and I went to this location for dinner.  (As you can imagine, it is difficult to find places where my wife may eat.)  We ordered my favorite, Red Curry Chicken, and tried the beef Red Curry.  

Maybe because I have only ate lunch at the Tempe location, but the servings were much different here.  At Tempe, you get a small bowl of soup, a spring roll, and about half the amount of Curry and rice.  For dinner here, I was disappointed that it didn't include the delicious spring rolls, but the portions were huge!  My wife and I could have shared a single Curry and just ordered extra rice.  It comes in a large urn.  As usual, it was some of the best Curry I have eaten.  (I love Curry.)  

My wife's beef curry was medium and was a little bland for me, but she thought my spicy was too hot.  (Here they have a rating for the heat from 1 - 5.  In Tempe, they simply ask if you want it mild, medium, or hot.  This location has extra hot, and super hot.  I just tried hot.)

We will definitely be going back again despite we live 10 miles away and there are two closer locations.  Best of all, my wife could eat it.  However, it turned out to be too sweet.  I think they sweeten the coconut milk they use.  So we will have to ask about this next time.  By the way, the service was great."}
{"text":"Very good Thai, not too much different from what you would normally see out there. But the spice and quality is definitely there. I gave them 4 Thai chili peppers.."}
{"text":"First time to this location.
First time ordering lunch for pickup.
Food was ready quickly!

The food portion for the lunch price was huge.  I ordered mild and it was perfect.  Everything was fresh and yummy.  I ordered Sans eggplant and was so happy they got everything right.  On top of lunch I also got one of this appetizer mini egg rolls with sauce.

Love this chain."}
{"text":"Just moved here from California in the summer  and was so happy to find a good Thai food place! Every time my folks fly in to visit we order out here and buy many different things on the menu to share with each other. Great as leftovers as well. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Love it berry good food and friendly serves will be back had a great time with friends and family"}
{"text":"Chicken overcooked and dry, beef overcooked and tough, and the veggies were not fresh. We didn't even keep the leftovers.  I thought it was pricey for the amount of food as well.  I'll eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"i visited on jan 19 and ordered the thai basil (their signature dish) with calamari, which had a very unique flavor that was a bit masked by the spiciness. i'm a wimp when it comes to spices, and i was overwhelmed by the medium i ordered. though the dish was very good, it was, for a dish dish consisting mostly of vegetables, on the scant side for 11.95. 

my friend ordered a curry, and it was a sizable portion, presented in a clay pot. i sneaked a bite, and it was very good too.

the place is comfortable and intimate, with booths and tables, and the wait staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Just ordered Pad Thai from here and let me tell you this is no where near authentic. The sauce they used was more on the sour side. 

I was so excited to find a Thai restaurant on such quick noticed and based on the reviews I thought it would be great. The noodles weren't dry but I felt like I was eating sour soup rather than the classic Pad Thai. 

Only thing worth one star is the Thai tea I ordered and the mints..

Never again. Also over priced for ehhh food. ."}
{"text":"Nice place I love it food is good I love red curry u guys should try it  I enjoyed I suggest u guys try it"}
{"text":"I would stay away from this place if you know what Thai food taste like, I had the tofu pad Thai and it was so bland and wet, should've just went to Taco Bell and ate the quesalupa.  The spring rolls were really oniony also, just not good food at all, and pad Thai is one of the easiest dishes to make, go figure. I will not be eating here ever again and such a shame because I live around the corner.  The host was friendly tho and no one was in the restaurant on a Saturday, should've went with my gut and stayed away!!!"}
{"text":"Was really excited to see that they deliver and called in with a large order on, but sadly to no avail. I was made aware they no longer deliver and my salivating and dreams of yellow curry and satay were crushed."}
{"text":"Average Thai food place.  Nothing too special.

Nice dining area.  Pleasent staff."}
{"text":"I live about 1/2 mile away. My husband and I walked over today, Saturday, since the weather was great. They advertise closing at 9:30 on google, yelp, and their front door.  We arrived at 8:45 pm, and the server told us they were closing early at 9 and couldn't serve us. I will update my review if and when I come back. My disappointment put a bad taste in my mouth.  There are a few more Thai Basil locations on Chandler Blvd I may return to before coming back."}
{"text":"First time trying this place since its close to me and it was so disappointing, I ordered the Pad Thai (mild) chicken and only found 3 little tiny pieces of chicken in there, but honestly that wasn't even the problem because it tasted horrible, it was so sour, just didn't taste good at all, never getting food from there again."}
{"text":"Thai Basil is a cheap Thai food restaurant that skimps on the details. I've only been for lunch.  Quaity is good if you want curry, but not so good if you want fried rice or noodles.

The good:
- Very cheap lunch specials.
- Dining room is clean and well-kept.
- Curries are very tasty.

The bad:
- Some food is prepared hastily.  Fried rice is not chopped up and noodles are not separated prior to frying.  This leads to a lot of raw, unflavored noodles and rice in the dish."}
{"text":"Went to Thai Basil on Chandler in Ahwatukee a little over a year ago and haven't been back since.  We waited over an hour for our food and it was burnt and tasted bad and it seemed like the whole place had no idea what they were doing.  Got a front row seat to a rather portly gentlemen who was picking up a to go order and had to wait over an hour for it as well once he got in the restraunt to pick up his food.   Guy made a huge scene in front of everyone in the joint while he yelled at the staff, and eventually walked out after they refunded him his money.  If I want this kind of service and food I'll go eat over at Native New Yorker on cheap chicken wing night.  If you want good Thai food go to Yupha's in Tempe, that place destroy Thai Basil in every single way period."}
{"text":"Good lunch specials.  Thai lunch prices seem too high, but I am okay at Thai Basil.  I am becoming a regular, based on price alone.  If they raise their lunch special anymore, I'd have to go down the street or bring the brown bag for lunch."}
{"text":"we have been to multiple thai restaurants in the SE Valley and this restaurant was by far the worst thai food we have eaten around here!! Service was alright but food quality was sub par... not returning"}
{"text":"Good Thai food and nice atmosphere.  The Tom yum is good as is the chai tea.   Recommend is you like spicy food."}
{"text":"First time at this Thai Basil. Arrived at 7 on a Wednesday night and there were four other tables full. 

We were greeted right away and offered menus. We are Thai aficionados so we only took two minutes to decide: Larb, Beef Pad Thai and Yellow Curry Chicken - all pretty standard Thai food. Our server was pleasant and accommodating to allergies. She was also very quick. 

Our Larb arrived in about six minutes. It was seasoned well, with a good balance of sweet and fish sauces. We felt there was three times the amount of lettuce needed for the meat tho. 

The rest of our meal arrived 7-8 minutes later. The Curry Chicken was good but there was only about 2 ounces of chicken. Same for the Beef Pad Thai-very little beef. 

The service and flavor deserved five stars no doubt but they are skimping on costs and not doing these classic dishes justice."}
{"text":"I enjoyed a really good lunch here today thanks to a Living Social $20 gift certificate.  The only downside was that we had to order off the dinner menu and this was not indicated on the certificate. The place was completely full by 12:30, it has a nice ambiance, overall, and the service was pretty prompt and friendly.  Here's what we ordered:

- Spring rolls (non-fried, vietanmese style) - Very good and included two large rolls with peanut dipping sauce.  This appetizer is very light and healthy and almost reminds me of a seaweed salad

- Spicy noodles w/ pork - Very good and included more veggies (carrots, broccoli and cabbage) than Pad Thai, although I prefer the Pad Thai flavors over this particular sauce; also a good sized portion and plenty for two to share

- Coconut ice cream w/ fried bananas - DELICIOUS; this was decadent and an amazing combination of flavors; the fried bananas were light and fluffy (not greasy) and a perfect balance to the ice cream which had chunks of pineapple; my dining companion felt that it could have used more coconut

Overall, it was a great lunch and they even continued refilling our drinks as we sat there and talked for about two hours."}
{"text":"I went there tonight & I'm impressed. The service was awesome & the food very tasty! I'll definitely go back soon with my family! Also the place is really cute & cozy"}
{"text":"Love this place! I definitely would recommend any of the curry plates, they are wonderful!  The lunch prices are awesome and portions are just right. Service here is always good as well."}
{"text":"The place is very busy for lunch. All tables are full making you think it must be a good place. But service is terrible. Servers dont seem to like working or even greet you with a smile.after waiting 40 min for lunch to arrive. There was a hair in my appetizer and they brought me a new appetizer  with saute' chicken and one piece of stick was broken in the meat that they never removed . And then they forgot about my lunch and they were so busy. Their server came and apologize but they didn't even give me food to go at no charge as a courtesy"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. I've been to another location, and both were good. First i ordered the spicy noodles, and today I had the yellow curry. 

This place is PACKED during lunch. Remember to get in before 12 or else you'd be waiting for seats."}
{"text":"Okay, so I think it's the actual thai basil plant that gives this amazing flavor and aroma.  I love the food here, but I suggest you stick with their specialties like Garlic Eggplant or the many others.

The service is nothing to write home about and either is the decor, but let's face it where else will you get these flavors or bright beautiful vegetables?  And this is why the place is packed wall to wall by high noon, so get here early or really late."}
{"text":"I have visited this location regularly over the last few years, mostly for lunch but also for dinner. All of the servers are great, but we usually have Brian. He always remembers me and what I like to order as well as asks questions that show thoughtfulness and the desire to build relationships with customers. 

I normally get sweet and sour shrimp or chicken, but have also had the pad thai. My absolute favorite here are the spring rolls! They are made with tofu paper (no gluten), so I can have them! My favorite! Everything I've had here is very tasty!"}
{"text":"Just discovered this gem yesterday and, being new to the area, we are thrilled to find great Thai food!!

They were already pretty busy at 11:30, and the property is not very big so it felt slightly cramped - but the food and service made up for it! All of the 20 or so lunch specials are $6.95 (with beef or prawns costing $2 more), and includes a cup of tasty soup (that I think arrived before we sat down), a flaky spring roll and a slice of orange.

The better half had the Thai Fried Rice (Khao-Pad) with egg, mixed vegetables, onions, and garlic - it was really, really good! My Spicy Noodles (pan-fried rice noodles, bean sprouts, bell pepper, broccoli, cabbage, carrots, onions, and Thai basil) was excellent and perfectly spiced @ level #3.

Service was super-efficient, and friendly. 

We are already looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"Friendly, expedient service, delicious Thai iced tea !!!  The people are so gracious for your visiting...  The Pad Thai with chicken was filling and delicious.  The Curried Chicken Noodles and Tempura Battered Shimp-a perfect starter for the meal.  Highly recommend it if you are in Ahwatukee...."}
{"text":"$6.95 for lunch special

I ordered the ginger chicken special. It was plenty to share between 2 people. Everything was really good. It came with a small spring roll and slice of orange. We arrived around 1130am and just missed the \"Intel\" lunch rush. My friend ordered yellow curry and enjoyed it as well. She even had enough to take home for dinner. Next time we're splitting an entree. This was my first time here and I think I'll be back to try the other dishes."}
{"text":"Charged us (group of 5)18% tip for lunch without notice. We ended up double tipping for average food and service."}
{"text":"I ordered the Yellow Curry with White Rice. It tastes good, but I am not satisfied with the amount of rice that is given from the restaurant. You can't expect me to finish the big container of curry with just a tiny bit of rice. Other than that, it looks good."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Pad Thai, drunken noodle, chicken friend rice, pineapple fried rice, and peanut curry I would all highly recommend. Perfect lunch rush place for my office in Chandler."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat Thai food!! Friendly staff & the food is always fresh & hot."}
{"text":"The food isn't too bad but the spice level needs work. I ordered Hot and it was hot but my friend ordered med and there was very little to no spice.

The service is really bad. there nice but really don't know how run a restaurant or serve. There was 3 people to do everything and there was no order to anything. They forgot what table ordered what and was very unorganized  

I went because of the groupon but will not be returning. It may worth a try with the groupon."}
{"text":"This place was so awesome! Great food and great service... 

I ordered an appetizer -- egg rolls. I was very surprised at how many were in the order. Usually there are 3 or 4 but this had around 6 or so and they were amazing.. Nice and flaky and the sauce was very good. 

I ordered the spicy noodles in a medium spice level. I thought it was perfect and my family ordered different dishes as well that were super. 

The service was excellent !"}
{"text":"Small little quiet place. Server was friendly and food came out hot and fast. Had the orange chicken mild as you pick how hot. Comes with white rice. Some of best flavor had in long time. Ordered side of fried rice as well that was good but took most of it to go for work tonight."}
{"text":"I tried this place a couple weeks ago for lunch, and it was good.  I got the garlic chili vegetables with tofu...heat level 3.  Boy was I sweating!  Really good though!  The only bad things were that the soup was barely warm and the toilet wouldn't flush in the ladies room.  Great service though....food came out super fast!  Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Thai Basil has an cozy indoor dining area and a modest outdoor dining area. The place was beautifuI, neat and clean. I found the inside of the restaurant a bit over done with their ornaments, especially with the small statues  all placed around their bar near the cash register, but the picture frames with the elephants and buddhas were tastefully placed around the dining tables. The bamboo blinds were a very good addition to the ambiance. I especially liked the color of the tables and chairs, a kind of warm brown....

The dishes took long to arrive, but probably because there were a lot of us who were ordering. The waitress did her job well and was very informative on what dishes we should try next. The refill of our glasses were very prompt and even early...my glass was only three-fourths full and she would come and refill it right away. The waitress was always smiling and in good spirits. Great service.

We ordered 4 dishes - spicy noodles, chow mien, Thai basil, and silver noodles. They were all pretty good and tasty! I liked the spicy noodles the best! It had a light savory sauce and the saltiness was just right. The silver noodles with black bean sauce was a bit salty for me but it was delicious all the same. Thai basil was served with rice, it was also good but I'm not very fond of anise flavor. We had the Thai Basil in mild and we later found out it was better if it were a lot more spicier.  

The chow mien was delightful, it was my second favorite among the four. It had a thick spicy sauce and crunchy vegetables. All the dishes with their noodles and vegetables were cooked just right and their noodles were a bit chewy at first but when it cooled down a bit, it was soft and yummy...I like mine chewy though. =) Every thing really smelled good!

It was a great dining experience. I loved the hospitality mints...they were soft and melted in your mouth."}
{"text":"I love their tofu pad thai! I've been here twice, and I think this is a really cute and tidy place. Their service is great and fast. Everyone here is super polite."}
{"text":"Quick and friendly service. They knew about gluten and dairy allergies and were able to tell me right away what I could have and how to modify items. Great food and a fair price. Can't wait to be back next time I hit the outlet mall nearby. I didn't get that gross why did I eat that feeling, and the Pad Thai was delicious!"}
{"text":"I ordered pick up (vegetarian yellow curry) and it was delicious! Very large portion for the $10 you pay for it. Friendly guy on the phone and when I picked up my order! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Food is always excellent. Service is great, no matter what time of day. Happy Hour is a great time to go!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised this location doesn't have a higher star count! 

Their customer service is *excellent.*

I have a habit of ordering the same dish (eggplant garlic) every visit but I do so because it is always delicious. The Thai basil  sautéed with the various fresh vegetables in the usual Thai brown sauce is the right amount of food and flavor. 

Their spring rolls. To. Die. For. Crunchy, flavorful and paired with that perfect sweet and sour sauce. 

Their takeout service is quick and fresh, every time. I'm a big fan."}
{"text":"I went here once several years ago and wasn't impressed, but recently I've recently gone back and I've been extremely impressed with the overall experience. I understand there was a change in management some time ago, and they are clearly doing things right.  I've been back three times recently and each time my family all agreed it was excellent.  

I have dined at all the Thai Basil locations multiple times and feel that when you're craving Thai food, each of these restaurants is a consistent and reliable option.  Based on my recent experiences with this Chandler location, I have to say it is the best of all the Thai Basil restaurants in the valley.

BTW, I saw someone gave a one-star rating after trying their panang curry.  I had it recently and there is no way any reasonable person could offer such a rating.  I'm a curry-loving person, and it was up there with my favorite curry dishes I've ever had.  Even if the person didn't like the particular way the sauce was prepared, everything they serve is made with a great deal of care and always with fresh ingredients--there's no way you can call it \"vile\" and give the restaurant one star.  That's simply ridiculous."}
{"text":"Chicken satay appetizer was good. Staff was friendly but that's about all I can say. Soft shell crab serving was disgusting. Small portion of crab as well. Thai basil wasn't very good either. Lacked flavor. Overall too expensive and not good enough. Won't return anytime soon."}
{"text":"Ehhh, the baby corn is from a can and was cold, not the same temp as the rest of my lunch in the ginger chicken dish. I think maybe it was added as an afterthought? I ordered takeout around 2:30 and picked it up at 2:50. The young guy working was closing, literally locked the door behind me as I left and I think he was in a rush. I would've given 3 stars for the food but the way it was packed was terrible. The styrofoam was completely melted through causing my broth based soupy stir fry to leak all over my car on the 10 minute drive home. 
Super annoying that cleaning the car is going to cost more than the sub par lunch. Why does Thai Basil put a liquid based meal in a styrofoam flap take out box?"}
{"text":"We've been to Thai Basil several times now and enjoyed it in the past. This afternoon's experience was awful! My husband and I were told we'd have to wait \"25\" minutes for our food because they were so busy with take-out orders! This is a fast food restaurant! We waited and when our food came, the temperature of our food was lukewarm. I requested \"0\" spice on my Tofu Drunken Noodles and the girl said they couldn't do that; it had to be mild! So much for the customer getting getting what they want! When I got my food, it was so spicy my mouth was on fire!!! We will never go back to Thai Basil! The girl taking our order couldn't be understood nor was she friendly!"}
{"text":"Really not bad. Relatively fair priced too. Surely not over populated. Thai tea was real good. Food was alright too, maybe a little generic for my taste. I kind of got feeling that no matter what you order it would taste same.
Never the less honest 4 *. Surely nice joint.

\"I like\"

{"text":"We came on Saturday night, prime dinner time, with a group-on, and although we were seated right away, we didn't receive our drinks until at least 25 minutes in (my husband starting timing when the wait became extraordinary) and then they ran out of our appetizer, so we had to reorder, and it then came with the entrees at once all ten minutes later. Yes it was busy and they were overwhelmed, but Restaurant 101 should be to serve your wine first & early so the customers aren't so conscious of waiting. Also, some of the waiters were definitely doing housekeeping tasks (filing receipts, etc) instead of getting us our drinks. The food was a-ok for Thai Food, tasty, but not the most steller ingredients (all of the veggies were frozen, etc). All in all, happy to see diversity in the Chandler restaurant scene, but I expected better."}
{"text":"My family and friends  eat here quite often. 
The place is clean, serene decor and quality service.

I have tried almost everything a few times. I can say  nothing I have tried has ever let me down. I usually do chicken our tofu. I haven't had any beef here.
 I must say I love the Curry with baby eggplant and vegetables. It is beautifully presented and colors are  fabulous. My palate flushes and wants more and more..

I have tried all the different Curries Red Green and Yellow~ love them all and they are good at getting your mild  medium or hot preference correct. 
I also like the small jar of extra pepper spice on the tables in case one wants to really spice it up."}
{"text":"Horrible food. The duck dish was not fresh. Padsee ew was really bad too. Comparing the dishes with other places i had the same dishes. Really disappointing. The soups and chicken satay were ok ok."}
{"text":"There are several Thai Basil restaurants in metro-Phoenix, although they're not all necessarily part of the same chain. I've been to one in Phoenix, one in Tempe, and this one in Chandler, which I've been to most often because it's close to my house.
I've had a good experience at every visit. Tonight we both ordered panang (peanut curry) with chicken and shared spring rolls as an appetizer. The food was served quickly, and the waitress was attentive but not overbearing.
Our entrées, served with a bowl of white rice for each, were tasty but spicier than usual. We both ordered medium spicy, but within a minute I started sweating and his nose started running. I know people who eat at Thai restaurants for the drenched-in-sweat experience, but that's not for me. Still, 5 stars because I know their medium spicy (normally) is medium spicy."}
{"text":"We stopped here for a quick dinner . Service was good, food came out very fast and it was ok. It just looked like they just tossed everything on the plate and didn't even bother to cook it properly. Chicken tasted dry, you could tell it was cooked separate from the rest of the meal. Appetizers were great, good selection for happy hour menu."}
{"text":"I ordered tom yum soup for lunch. It was so-so. Got receipt and it had wrong tips suggested which were disproportionate to the actual amount. 33% tip was mentioned as 20%."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place for a quick lunch and was very pleased. 

Small dining room, busy week day lunch crowd.. Food was delivered quickly.. I had the chicken Green curry .. Medium heat.. Was spot on.. The plate was beautiful.. 

Will definitely be back to try some of the other lunch specials"}
{"text":"Got there about an hour before closing so the service we a little slow but the food was good. The veggies seemed fresh and the food was flavorful. The food is also affordable and the menu has a lot of options from which to choose. Haven't ordered takeout from here yet but will probably do so a lot in the future."}
{"text":"I bought a bunch of Restauant.com gift certificates over the holidays with the intent of finding adventure at a low cost.  So today my husband, 6-year old son, and I ventured out of Gilbert to try Thai Basil in Chandler.   I've only tried Thai food one other time and loved it so I was very excited to check this little joint out.

The food was good...not incredible...not bad...but good.   My favorites were the fried sweet potatoes with a plum sauce, my husband's Seafood Thai Basil  (the signature dish), and the Coconut Soup with Chicken.  All very yummy.    My Pad Thai was OK as well.  The food overall was well cooked, appropriately seasoned, and fresh.    

The atmosphere was cute and quaint...but the music made me feel like I had to whisper.    The service was slow, which was disappointing because there were very few other customers.  My husband ordered Diet Coke that came frozen in the can twice.

Overall, I would eat here again, get Thai Basil take-out, and not tell my friends to stay away."}
{"text":"OMG. I am new to AZ and this was my first Thai experience in the Valley. Might I add it was most enjoyable. The food was excellent. The service attentive. The prices reasonable. The atmosphere cozy. I will definitely return. 
My order consisted of Pad Thai with chicken, seafood curry and Thai Basil (the signature dish) all of the above were excellent. I am planning my next trip as I type."}
{"text":"On Sunday's the sign says open from 12-4pm...my family and I get there at 3:20 and they won't let us in. Never coming back."}
{"text":"I am here two or three days per week.  Service is amazing and food is outstanding.  Lunch specials are great deals as well."}
{"text":"Since moving to Arizona almost three years ago, I have been searching and searching for a place to get even near my favorite Thai restaurant ever...Penny's in Chicago.  

Found it.

Other than the fact that I received both chicken AND tofu in my specifically ordered chicken only, I am getting so close to my old Chicago favorite.  

The pad Thai was made exactly as spicy as I wanted and the take out was ready in precisely four minutes.

Ahhh.  Delish!  And...one minute down the road from my house!"}
{"text":"I did a double-take when I saw the Thai Basil sign go up in a small strip mall near my neighborhood.  Could this really be the same Thai Basil that make my mouth water whenever I drive by it in Tempe?!  Sure enough, the brand has extended its reach to Chandler and brought its delicious food, cozy atmosphere and excellent service along for the ride.

I enjoy many of their dishes but my favorite is their Pad Thai.  Unlike the gummy, overly-salty versions at other restaurants, this dish at Thai Basil maintains a delicate balance of sweet and spicy, with a nice peanut flavor.  (One of my favorite things about Thai Basil is their ability to vary the \"heat\" so that both my husband and I can enjoy our dishes just the way we like them.)

The peanut curry is also delicious.  The vegetables are always bright, fresh and cooked minimally to convey a nice crunch.

The service here is excellent, whether for takeout or dine in.  I would recommend it to anybody who loves great Thai food!"}
{"text":"I picked up Pad Thai take out for lunch.  I found the sauce to be heavier than I care for.  Not bad, just too heavy.  I like Pad Thai with a light sauciness, not graviness.

As a rule sauciness is much more appealing than graviness.  I'll generally take sauciness over sassyness as well.  And rudeness.  Definitely sauciness over rudeness."}
{"text":"I learned not to order on yelp during lunch time at this restaurant today. I ordered 2 fried rice and came after 5 minutes but the orders on Yelp were not physically put in their system yet. The reason is the tablet that they used was out of battery. Also the restaurant seemed to be too busy so they may not even pay attention to the tablet. The portions of the 2 orders do not look consistent. Maybe this happens as chicken may cost more than tofu so I have less fried rice on the chicken order."}
{"text":"Decent Thai food in Chandler, but far from true authentic Thai. Came here on a Saturday around 3PM and 1 other table filled. 

I had the Panang curry, Thai hot, and my friend had the red curry, medium. Both had a fairly thin broth, and my \"Thai hot\" was more like a \"medium\" at other Thai restaurants. I would have asked for fresh chopped Thai chili to add, but they charge extra which turned me off (I've never seen this charged at any Thai restaurant before, and I've been to many). My friend had the Thai Iced Coffee, which was incredibly oversweetened as well. Otherwise, pricing was fair and service friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Very good curry. Masamans curry was so delicious. Service was fast. Definitely a restaurant to keep int the rotation."}
{"text":"It's OK, but I prefer Thai Rama."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times now.  It's tasty Thai food.  Would like to see a better beer selection... no microbrews!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I had been stuck with the flu and needed something spicy and tasty to help with being decongestant. My friend and I had found this place on our drive to Chandler Mall. We were not sure where to eat and I just happen to see this establishment as we passed Rural and Chandler Blvd. I am sure glad we stopped here! I ordered their fresh rolls with shrimp that is freshly prepared. The fresh rolls with served with a sauce that tasted very similar to peanut butter; it must try! For the main entree, I ordered the spicy fried rice but asked to make it Thai hot. I was sick with the flu but managed to eat my entire meal. I had went with my friend who is Thai and she was even impressed with the dishes. I recommend to anyone with taste buds! We will be returning soon as I believe for February through March, they are offering 15% off your check on Sundays."}
{"text":"Good thai food. I ordered the spicy noodles with tofu..and I asked for maximum hot.....oo and it was good. Good service. Not the greatest thai food I ate but still good."}
{"text":"My friend and I were in the mood for something healthy so we stopped by Thai Basil on Chandler Blvd and ordered a verity of menu items to try. Every single items we ordered was fresh, hot and had wonderful flavor. And may I include the homemade coconut/ pineapple ice cream.
The service was and hospitality was excellent! It could not get any better.
We will be back to try the next things on the large menu.

Thanks so much for an enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"I love this Thai restaurant. I often order take out as well. The service is always fast and mostly friendly. The food is excellent. Their curry is one of the best around. They do not use MSG in their cooking either which is a huge bonus. I do love their curries and noodle dishes especially their peanut curry, yellow curry and pad see iew (sp?). I haven't had anything I didn't like yet. Hope you enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is perfect for lunch only if you go before 11.50am. It's close to workplace, has quick service and good food making it ideal for quick lunches. 

Garlic and red curry are really good."}
{"text":"Visited Thai Basil again yesterday while on my way back to the DREADED DMV. The DMV Sucked as usual, but Thai Basil was wonderful as always! I had the Red Curry Chicken & had it Thai Hot. Let me say it was the perfect amount of heat. The sauce is Sweet & hot & DELICIOUS! My husband had the Yellow Curry Chicken and was just as impressed. The food comes out in no time & the atmosphere is very ZEN if you get my drift. The music is tranquil & you can always hear birds gently tweeting in the back ground. A great break away when you have to face the dreaded DMV or on break from a hectic day at work. GOOD STUFF!!!"}
{"text":"I don't know why I waited so long to try this place when it is literally right around the corner from my house.  I think its because I went to the one in Ahwatukee a long time ago and didn't care for the food.  But I don't think they have the same owners since the websites are totally different.  But anyway, on to the review.

We ordered takeout and I was very impressed with how nicely it was all packaged and how quickly it was ready.  Also, the woman on the phone was very friendly, easy to understand in spite of an accent, and patient in explaining the menu items that I was unfamiliar with. All the appetizers sounded so good, we decided to get a bunch so the hubby and I could just pick at them since he was sick and didn't have much of an appetite.  However, the portions were bigger than expected so we ended up with quite a lot of food.  Lettuce wraps were very tasty, I loved the dressing on them.  Eggrolls were good but a little too much \"wrapper\" and not enough filling IMO.  Sweet potato chips were not what I was expecting, they were the white sweet potatoes that really don't have much taste to them and they were deep fried with I believe a panko breading on them.  A little bland but the sweet/hot dipping sauce they came with was fantastic.  I loved it so much I would order this again just for the sauce.  Also got some chicken soup for the sick hubby which I didn't try but he said was quite good. I threw in some pad thai noodles since that basic dish is always my test when evaluating a new Thai restaurant.  I asked for a four (out of five) on the spiciness scale and that was perfect for me.  I was very pleased at the heat level and overall flavor of the dish.  So many places hold back on the chiles if you are American, even if I insist I want it hot, and I have never understood why. The only thing missing was a squeeze of lime and garnish of fresh cilantro that I like on my pad thai.  Presumably you could get that upon request if you were dining in, it was no big deal to me since I had some at home.

I still prefer Yupha's as the best Thai in the area.  But I will definitely be back here for takeout because of the friendly, speedy service and convenient location.  I noticed some wine bottles in the back when I was picking up my food so that may entice me to dine-in at some point as well."}
