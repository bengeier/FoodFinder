{"text":"Awesome fresh sandwiches!  Real deli turkey not that subway fake crap. Definitely recommend as a great place to stop for lunch."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why people review this place so highly. Maybe it's conveniently located to them? Otherwise, the food is poor quality and very....VERY much overpriced. Selection is scarce. Service is AWFUL. Walk a few blocks and take in one of the many gems of the Strip. But this is not one."}
{"text":"Food is delicious, especially the chicken salad! The staff are great people, super nice. I try to go at least once a week. It's quick food too that's better quality and actually faster than most drive throughs. Made right I  front of you too!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to get a drink and a scratch off... sure wish we didn't eat lunch.. the sandwiches looked good and the wall of chips just blew me away.  There also was a large selection of beverages. This market was clean/modern.   I am definitely going back for a deli sandwich."}
{"text":"Just discovered this market while working nearby. I wasn't sure where to place my order (back by the food, not the counter) at first. Their egg salad is amazing! Their prices are low! You can add chips AND can of pop to your food for just $1 extra! AND they gave me a little piece of candy in my bag too. I felt like I got a lunch made by my mom/someone that cares about me. I'll be going back today and often."}
{"text":"Best deli in the strip... Everyone at work wants to somehow buy stock in their business!!! Haha"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Always friendly. Good food and they remember I don't have cheese on my salads."}
{"text":"Thursday's are my favorite day of the week because I get to have two Louie's buffalo chicken wraps. De lic ous.   All the employees are super friendly. It's a great change of pace to get a wrap from here and have Abby ch if friendly smiling faces.   I've also had their chicken Caesar wrap - real good...and their meatball sub which is top notch. My wife loves their chicken salad sandwich.   Very \"cute\" store with good prices and friendly staff - can't beat it!"}
{"text":"I work right across the street from here and let me just say the food is a wonderful mix an the staff led by Lisa the owner is great.   I went with the Wednesday lunch special of Hot Roast Beef sandwich/mashed potatoes with chips and a drink. I want to point out the cost of only $6.50 and I couldn't even eat the chips. Like I need them. Give them a try. It's hard to find a lunch at this cost downtown."}
{"text":"In the years of working downtown actually almost right directly across from the Louies I became well acquainted with it.  My visits were almost daily whether it be for a bite to eat at breakfast or lunch or a coffee during breaks, and the occasional pack of smokes if running low.  They also offer as many pointed out some grocery items, ice creams, fresh fruit and lottery.    I loved the convenience of Two Louies and the variety of options they have.  Everyday they have a special, and it was usually 6.50 included a candy bar (bite size) and a can of soda.  One Thursdays my office would go crazy as that was their Buffalo Chicken wrap day... I swear 1/2 of my office ate lunch there every single day.  They make a pretty good egg salad wrap and that is what I usually got when I went there. If you are local and need a quick meal that costs under $10.00 give it a try."}
{"text":"Just stopped by for breakfast - bacon egg and cheddar wrap was 90% tortilla and 9% egg, so far from the best. Added an extra star because the folks behind the counter were super friendly. AMEX NOT ACCEPTED HERE - if traveling for business, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Man o man, the Thanksgiving In A Bun sandwich I had for lunch today from here was out of bounds! It's a turkey day dinner in a kaiser roll: turkey, mashed potatoes, stuffing, gravy with cranberry and chips on the side. They only sell it on Tuesdays. I loved it. Recommended!!! I'd love to try more of their stuff."}
{"text":"I am blessed in that I work the same distance from 2 great delis. Any day when I don't have my packed lunch I check out the specials online. If it sounds good I'm in! I really enjoyed the Thanksgiving dinner on a bun. It was my first trip here and it's a winner. Anyone who knows me know that I'm a sucker for turkey. It's probably the only thing keeping me from being a vegetarian.   I've been back 3 times since my first turkey dinner and everything I have had has been wonderful."}
{"text":"The service here is phenomenal.  This is the polar opposite of a dirty crap staffed-by-ahole-ex-convicts 7/11.  This place is clean, they have baskets full of fruit and awesome breakfast sandwiches.  Every single time I've been in here the ladies behind the counter have been exceptionally pleasant.  And there are always several people working, which means, service!  I just bought some fruit there and the lady offered to wash my apples.  Wash my apples.  Imagine that happening at a damn A-Plus."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches, especially the breakfast sandwiches which are served all day.  However dont expect any grilled sandwiches or panini :("}
{"text":"A nice neighborhood deli near my office.  Good sandwiches (breakfast and lunch).  Service is always good and friendly.  There is no seating here so everything is grab and go."}
{"text":"Two Louie's is a short walk away from my job, and it's always so tempting to stop in for a quick breakfast or their daily lunch special! My favorite breakfast is a sausage, egg, and cheese on a croissant, so any bad morning I'm having can be turned around by Two Lou's in a snap.  It's always a hard choice between their classic sandwich menu and their salads for lunch, but you can't go wrong either way. My favorite is probably their grilled chicken salad with mixed greens. Their raspberry dressing is to die for. One of my friends loved the dressing so much that she bought a gallon of it! Some of my coworkers are fans of their stuffed pepper soup on Wednesdays and their buffalo chicken wraps on Thursdays. I've never heard a complaint, except about their prices. They've been increased since I first started frequenting Two Lou's, and sometimes it can get a bit expensive.  It's a simple setup inside, with the food counter on the right side, snacks and basic grocery items, and some cold drinks. Two Lou's is a take-out only restaurant, but one of my favorite unique touches is the brown bag and small piece of candy they package your lunch with. It gives it a real \"mom and pops\" feel, and not to mention who doesn't love a snickers bar? Two Lou's is great when you need a quick bite to eat and you want that home-cooked feel. I'll be visiting the friendly ladies of Two Lou's one morning in the near future, I'm sure!"}
{"text":"Two Louie's--coming to rescue a lunch near you!  I was in a meeting where everyone was systemically saying how hungry they were until we al decided to take a break and get lunch. Thanks goodness TL's was across the street to save the day!  I walked in to a normal looking deli place where you can grab a sandwich and go. This type of place is not your norm in Pittsburgh though and it was great to be able to get something fresh and run back to work.  They have a daily soup and some revolving items, but I decided to order a chicken salad wrap with some chips and a drink. This makes up one of their combo deals which they offer. The sandwich was super delicious, and I was so glad that the staff double checked with ingredients with me proactively (it has grapes and craisins) just to make sure I was cool with it.  I also noticed several people coming in and being greeted by the staff. I love when people get a \"spot\" like that where they can interact and get a moment to have their day brightened...that's what this place was for me!  This might be my new lunch go-to when I'm downtown/near the strip during the week! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"What a diamond in the ruff!! It was like walking into a time warp. The wood all around. Easy to read menu with lots of choices and also a large selection of chips. Everything is made to order with fresh ingredients. Plus you can add chips and a drink for $1.00!! Where you gonna find that these days. I had a chicken Cesar wrap with the dressing on the side. Everything was fresh. There was a line when I walked in but it moved pretty fast. They also have a daily special."}
{"text":"They were friendly. Also pretty cheap as compared to the other convenient stores near downtown Pittsburgh. There also cooked food here but I only brought things to take back to he room."}
{"text":"I love this place. I am lucky it is so convenient to where I work. I come here for the breakfast sandwiches and the hoagies at lunch. The staff is always friendly. Great place to come to!"}
{"text":"An impromptu weekday lunch with Kay, something I could only swing on through the magic of vacation time, took us to her favorite new sandwich spot, Two Louie's Market.   In a space that looks almost like a bookstore, everyday items such as bottle salad dressing and bagged chips are displayed proudly, almost artistically on box shelves. The wall behind the counter is exposed brick, and on it the chalkboard menu can be seen.   A friendly group of women mind the deli. Containers of various salads can be found in the row of coolers in the back. There's even a deparment store soft pretzel warmer near the register, and a hot dog roller behind that.   So yes, this is an upscale Uni-Mart.   That's not to knock it down the cellar stairs and forget about it as I'm sure those who work in the vicinity of TLM are grateful for it (the joint was abuzz with commerce when we were there), and the prices aren't too out of line ($20 for two sandwich combos).   Heck, I'm grateful for the darling chicken salad wrap I consumed at Kay's workplace picnic area by the river and bike trail. There was never a more beautiful, breezy, cloudless day to enjoy lunch outdoors than there was yesterday, particularly a meaty, creamy, grape-laden Waldorf-ish treat swaddled in a moist, sticky spinach-infused tortilla with my standard l-t-o as well as 'Murican cheese. Each combo got us a canned beverage, and snack chips, but we had to go one further and get some chocolate chip cookies too. And for something that was shrinkwrapped and manufactured elsewhere, my cookie was not garbage.  A cute touch: The inclusion of a random mini-candy bar with each bag of grub. It's like Halloween everyday at Two Louie's!  P.S. There's no place to sit inside, so it's strictly take-out.   P.P.S. I hope they start making potato salad. There's none on the menu! This needs to be corrected!"}
{"text":"I love this place. They have almost anything you could want for lunch (soup of the day, sandwiches, salads, wraps, etc.). They even have daily specials. I love their homemade wedding soup on Mondays and buffalo chicken wrap on Thursdays. Breakfast is served all day too. The prices are reasonable. This is one of my go-to's."}
{"text":"This is the type of place the world needs more of. They have a great selection of little snacks drinks and treats. Everything in the store is really reasonably priced. I usually stop in for some odds and ends that I forget at the grocery store. Being pregnant I crave something one day and hate it the next so this is the perfect place to go I can get individual size cereals or pop tarts for a decent price.  I've heard great things about their food so I decided to try it today for lunch I had a turkey hoagie that I couldn't  even take a picture of because I ended up eating so fast. I need to remember that this place is here anytime I need something fast instead of going to a chain like subway or McDonald's.  Staff is super friendly and super fast!"}
{"text":"This place is seriously mind-blowing.  Not only is the food excellent, but the service is incomprehensibly good.  I timed my visit there today during lunch rush (12:15ish) starting from the time I stepped in the door, to the time I stepped out.  EIGHT MINUTES.  I got three wraps with sides and drinks.  I've never seen anything like it.  The atmosphere is adorable, the menu is huge, and the ingredients are high quality.  There is nowhere to eat inside, BUT there is often street parking available within their block if you aren't in walking distance."}
{"text":"Clean, efficient, tasty sandwich, priced right. Stopped into Two Louie's at 11:50 to get a sandwich to take to a 12:35 Pirates game. We wondered about the line and how long it would take to get a sandwich and be on our way. Not long! In and out by noon.  Our turkey hoagie was prepared to order, cut in half and even wrapped separately!  Will be back again next time visiting Pittsburgh!"}
