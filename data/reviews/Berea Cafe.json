{"text":"Stopped in for a beer, thought the selection was just o.k.. The bartender lady with the blonde hair who works during the day and up till 7:00 was very nice. Glanced over the menu, it seemed o.k. not sure if I will dine with them or not. As soon as the our server went home and a young man took over, the music on the jukebox got loud.  No thank you.  We left.  No need to make the music so loud you can't hear the person next to you.  They have 2 pool tables, that's a bonus."}
{"text":"This is on again, off again, a B-W hangout. When I was at B-W, it was off again, strictly for townies. B-W students did not hang out t Berea Cafe, which you would think would be a hangout since it is one of the only bars adjacent to B-W. However, in the early 2000's, it was not a hang out for college kids. This sets up the story: 

In late 2003, a friend and I ventured out to Berea Cafe with a male friend who my friend had a crush on. We went into the basement, hencefoth referred to as \"rape room.\" It was right after 8 Mile came out and they played \"Lose Yourself\" and a white trash short woman jumped onto my friend. She was like clawing and humping my male friend while we looked on in horror. She had her legs wrapped around him and was like clawing at his neck. He kept looking at us like \"help me\" and we were paralyzed with shock. We didn't know what to do. Then the song was over and she jumped off him and he came over to us. It was awkward. Our relationship has never been the same."}
{"text":"So it closed once I don't see it lasting long at all maybe a few months I had to tell the bartender how to make a drink and yet she still made it completely wrong pretty sure grape freeze doesent have watermelon pucker but owner says so it did worlds word Dj blowing the entire room full of smoke when we were the only two in there but hey they were trying to impress us sucks this spot can't last as anything"}
