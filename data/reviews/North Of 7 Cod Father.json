{"text":"I very much enjoyed eating at North of 7 Cod Father!   It's a great place and we had a great dinner!  I had halibut with a Greek salad paired with white wine and all three were on point. My husband had haddock and jalape√±o poutine paired with a bottle Keith's!! Let me tell you something about this poutine.....it was perfect and amazing!  Maybe the best poutine I've ever tasted! I can't wait to eat here again and again!  The only problem is I live in Toronto!  When I'm back in the area, I'm sure to visit this little gem again!"}
{"text":"We found this resto randomly after camping for the wknd. The food was amazing. We were all very very pleased. I ordered the halibut n poutine. The halibut was so fresh and very delish. The poutine was better than most poutine and I eat a lot of poutine. So glad we decided to try this place. The service was also better than most restos. The owner was very friendly and kind. This place really put a good end to our trip. I would def come back. That poutine!!"}
{"text":"The food was great, the service was even better. Our server, Rose, was very sweet. I recommend the Pickerel over the Cod but they were both good."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place on the way back from Eganville, which is not my usual route back from Ottawa.   The pickerel fish and chips was excellent. I also tried a piece of the breaded shrimp, and it was yummy.   The restaurant is licensed, so you can expect to find beer and coolers here, though I didn't inquire about wine. Service was friendly as well."}
