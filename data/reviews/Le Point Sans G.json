{"text":"I went on a Saturday for brunch with a party of 4 with a reservation and everything went smoothly. We were welcomed by a coffee, bowl of fruits and got our main plate. The food was amazing, tasty and the portions were generous. 

Great restaurant with bistro feels, everything is gluten-free and the staff is friendly (thanks to our waiter Michael)

It is hard to find restaurants with such an impressive menu (that changes every now and then, so there are a lot of variety) for people who have celiac disease. But Le Point Sans G offers a delightful alternative (they even offer gluten-free pasta on certain nights).

I will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"We were looking for a safe place for my husband to eat (he's celiac) and this was it. He had poutine for the first time and scrumptious carrot cake. The folks here were super nice, as well. Didn't use the bathrooms so can't comment on it."}
{"text":"My date was really happy with the brunch with some added bacon. On my side I loved the pancakes so tasty with the strawberries the strawberry sirup on the side was delicious as well. Since I'm a dark chocolate addict the chocolate sauce could have been thicker and darker.
As we left I got a slice of cornbread and and a muffin for later.... I should have had bought some more."}
