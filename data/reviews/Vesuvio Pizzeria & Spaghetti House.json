{"text":"It's just overpriced, ill-prepared pizza, but because this place holds nostalgic value for a lot of Junction locals, it's often busy. You're better off grabbing a slice on the takeout side of Vesuvio's. A slice is cheaper, and for some reason tastes far superior."}
{"text":"Best vegetarian pizza in town - great ingredients, great tasting, love it."}
{"text":"food is 4 stars but service is a 1. Once I ordered take out and waited 45 minutes, only to call back to find out we were out of their delivery area. No apologies, nothing. Dining in, they often mess up my order. Also, soda is $2.75, which is pretty expensive I think.   If you pick it up to go, the pizza is great!"}
{"text":"I don't know how this can be quoted like the best pizza in Toronto. I took a take out slice but not really impressed...I've never had dinner there though so I cannot judge the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"My family's favorite spot, I have been a customer since the late 1960s, my parents would order two amazing  pizza's before the hockey game Saturday nights . Great pastas ,  Greek salads, and the New York steak is amazing for $ 22 .00 Good wine selection and service... can't miss. !"}
{"text":"This review is entirely for delivery pizza. Until last week, I didn't even know where the restaurant itself was!  A-OK, just like yelp recommends a three-star rating should mean. Not bad, definitely not \"uh...just ok,\" not screamingly amazing. The whole pizzas, delivered piping hot to your door, are solid, A-OK, two thumbs up.  If you're in the mood to have someone bring you a pizza, you can't go wrong with a Vesuvio delivery, unless you have sodium issues. Yes, the pizza is quite salty. You'll want to have a lot of something thirst-quenching around.  That said, it's really yummy. Addictively so. It's not gourmet, it's not thin crust, it's not the kind you'd put want to have topped with prosciutto and arugula, nor the standard toppings for a quattro staggione pizza, etc. This is straight-up North American Italian pizza, with springy dough, tomato sauce, and generous toppings. It's the kind of pizza you think of when you imagine ordering one with sausage, black olives, and mushrooms, washed down with a beer or a nice big glass of root beer or cola or whatever soda you like. Of course they also offer \"gourmet\" toppings like artichoke hearts and eggplant, but I stick to the classics. The Vulcano (Hot Peppers, Hot Cappicollo, Hot Italian Sausage) is great.   I'm told it's the best delivery pizza around. I've never tried anywhere else in Toronto, so I couldn't say, but given that I've ordered no less than 14 Vesuvio pizzas in the past six months (usually the Vulcano), clearly I believe it!"}
{"text":"They have the best spagetti and meatballs that I have ever had!  The meatballs are melt in your mouth good! Friendly service and child friendly as well."}
{"text":"We just ordered a pizza and found that there was a strange taste that we couldn't place. It tasted moldy, so we thought it could have moldy provolone, or really strong or old mushrooms. A previous review mentioned their pizza taking on the taste of the cardboard box--that could be it too.   It's too bad. Their pizza used to be great, but we stopped ordering from them after dealing with a rude staff member on the phone (shocking, because it's hard to be rude when someone is just ordering a pizza from you).  At least the lady on the phone today was polite and professional."}
{"text":"Vesuvio's has long been a presence in the Junction, and it seems like the restaurant's fortunes mirror that of its up-and-coming neighbourhood. When I was growing up, Vesuvio's was getting run down; now the huge, renovated dining room strikes just the right balance between chic and casual. Even the separate pizza take-out area next door is cheerful and inviting.  Vesuvio's was never my favourite pizza (just a personal choice: I prefer a doughier, chewier crust), so when come to the restaurant I usually opt for one of their excellent pasta dishes or entrées. But no matter what you go for, it's made from fresh and interesting ingredients without being overly fancy."}
{"text":"I have 3 words to describe this place: Nom nom nom!  This is the best pizza in Toronto's west end for 50 years and running.   I've been going here for over 8 years, and have yet to be disappointed. The meat lasagna is my favourite. The chefs salad and anchovie with artichoke heart pizza or the chicken, red pepper and asiago pizza here are to die for. Everything tastes good here.  We had a $81 food order, and delivery to Weston and Eglinton was within 30 minutes and the food was burning hot.  I had the panzarotti here and loved it too, not enough sauce to cheese ratio though, more sauce!!  Its a little pricey, but damn is it ever worth it. This is a foodies DREAM.  You owe it to yourself to try a real mama and papa style italian restaurant.  Try the large pizza with pepperoni mushrooms and bacon, or the anchovie with artichoke heart pizza or even the chicken, red pepper and asiago pizza. Mmmmmm Mmmmmm.  Now im drooling......"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for about twenty years now, on and off.  Mostly off.  Every time I go back I hope to experience the flavour so many people have told me about.  Here's the thing: my own pizza is way better.  And, a few places in the neighborhood are better too, even Pizzaiolo,  which is almost a chain.  Tried V's again tonight: the driver was rude and forgot to bring in my salad (needless to say: no tip).  The pizza crust was dry, too thin, not enough sauce or cheese, bland.  In short, a bad pizza.  I wish Vesuvio's were better.  We could some honest to goodness, real pizza in this area.  Officially, Vesuvio's, you guys are off my list.  You need to focus on delivering higher quality - not getting lazy on a hyped reputation."}
{"text":"The toppings, sauce and cheese were ON POINT! The veggies are sliced so thin and they throw a heap on that you actually get to appreciate them. The crust is thin which makes the centre flavorful but the ends are pretty crunchy. However, the overall quality and attention to toppings overthrows the crunch! It's one of those pizzas that makes you smile when you open the box. Plus.. Cans of pop are $1 each- finally a restaurant that doesn't rip you off!"}
{"text":"Best Pizza in the city hands down. (If you're from Windsor, its almost identical style) Do try the Minestrone soup, amazing. Not your standard recipe. Great atmosphere, service, and menu. Clean. Enjoy."}
{"text":"??????????????? ?????????????????? ???????? ??????????????????????????????????????? ??????????????????  ?????????????????? ??? ?????????????????????????????????????  ??????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"I went here on a recommendation on a friend after she swore it was the best pizza in Toronto. I love pizza and actively seek out new places. She mentioned that the take out was good and that's usually my style. Man was I ever disappointed. I ordered a slice of pepperoni pizza and what I got was soggy dough, a layer of grease, and a taste in my mouth that was worst than garbage. I don't see what the hype is about this place. Do not go there, you will only be disappointed."}
{"text":"Had the pizza and pasta. Pasta was ok but the pizza was great. Even better the next day which is rare for thinner crusted pizza.  We did delivery and it took about 35 min."}
{"text":"i went there as i saw recos online for it, but i was not impressed. service was nothing to write home about and the pizza tasted bland. i did not understand what's so great about it. just a regular pizza joint. there are better places in the city.."}
{"text":"Despite having a fairly large dining room that is usually somewhat busy, I'd have to say that the take-out pizza at Vesuvio's is really their best food item. The other fare is ok but not amazing. The service does tend to be a little bit slow. It's a fine place for a table of two but takes forever to fill the orders of a larger group. The dning room is quite nicely decorated. Overall I've had an ok experience there."}
{"text":"I've been to, and ordered from Vesuvio a lot over the years, but the service has really gotten worse as of late.  Me and some friends ordered a pizza recently and was surprised to find that my order of green peppers was replaced with pepperoni on the pizza (the other toppings were the same), this is an issue because I'm a vegetarian and cannot eat pepperoni.   I phoned and explained that clearly there was some confusion, the person on the phone was extremely rude and explained that a new pizza will be over shortly - and that I shouldn't eat any of the first pizza so they can take it back (???). The delivery guy was clearly embarrassed he had to take the first pizza back, and he was the only one who offered any form of apology.   Needless to say that's gross (what are they doing with the first pizza? I explained my friends could eat it) and the lack of any apology except for the delivery guy (who is clearly not to blame for the confusion) has turned me off Vesuvio."}
{"text":"Although I wouldn't agree with the Star, which rated Vesuvio's pizza the best in the city, I would agree that it's the best in the neighbourhood.  The crust is thin and crispy, the toppings are fresh and the sauce is zesty and flavourful. I prefer to order takeout from this place because it seems to taste better for some reason. I've dined in before and the pizza tasted rather bland, as did the gnocci that my girlfriend ordered.  It's a bit more expensive and delivery time is longer than most chain pizza places, but Vesuvio's gives you quality food with real ingredients, so it's worth it."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the neighbourhood, even in the eyes of my 5yr old.  The menu beyond pizza is more mediocre, but it's still a good place to take kids for a reasonable dinner that they'll actually eat."}
{"text":"Just ordered a pizza after many recommendations from locals on Facebook. Pizza was cold, tough, flat and bland. Looked like it had been sitting under a hot lamp for two days. Delivered in the promised hour. Got a jaw workout with all the chewing, will not be going back for more."}
{"text":"cheese and meat ravioli  -really good -made in house -5/5  brushetta -a bit bland -but i'd get it again! -4/5  pepperoni, mushroom and ham pizza -3.5/5 -it was good, but i've had much better -$13.50 was a decent price for the portion size  service- 2.5/5 - we didn't get a bread basket but they gave all the other tables one.... is it cause we're asian?! -she was only nice when we were paying, but neglectful the entire dinner -no freshly cracked pepper offered while she offered other tables some  overall, i didn't like the service so I will probably never come again unless i get my ravioli to go!"}
{"text":"Our go to Pizza and Pasta place. Nothing fancy but good solid place to satisfy your pizza/pasta craving."}
{"text":"Best pizza I have ever had, anywhere. Popular in the neighbourhood, so difficult to get thru on phone sometimes, especially weekends. The rest of the menu is mediocre at best, but I don't know anyone who goes for the ravioli."}
{"text":"I ordered at 7:50pm My food arrived 1 1/2 hours later after calling to find out where it was.   I ordered the veal scallopini with spaghetti and a Caesar salad.   The veal was tough and the meal arrived cold.   When I rang to complain the manager took $10 off my credit card bill.  But no one actually apologized....  I have had pizza delivered by them before and have had no problems.   Maybe they were having a bad night?  And I'm still hungry!"}
{"text":"On saturday evening I suggested this local rest. for my friends and their daughter and I. My friend ordered the mushroom and pepperoni pizza, her husband the bruschetta and the vodka penne with sausage. 2 1/2 hours later my friends' husband was writhing in pain clutching his stomach. My girlfriend drove he and her daughter home, and spent the night helping him in and out of the bathroom. My girlfriend, who unfortunately, tried her hubby's pasta, woke the next morning, you guessed it, clutching her abdomen and running to make it to the washroom. It is now tuesday and  both tell me they are still in a great deal of pain and dealing with the same symptoms. The lab results are not back yet. Unfortunately, many restaurants hide behind the similarities of symptoms in food poisoning and the flu virus. Check your local reviews regularly and please add your poisoning stories as soon as they occur. I have telephoned the restaurant to let them know what happened and a manager told me there is a 'flu bug' going around and she's sorry to hear my friends aren't well. What do you think the proper response should have been? And, no, i do not want a voucher for free food. This group of 5 people, including all the people they know, will never set foot in there again. Bad bad bad. Ewwwwwwwwwww."}
{"text":"To me Vesuvio is the only decent Italian restaurant in the junction area. if you're in the Junction area and you feel like having Italian food Vesuvio is your best bet. if you're downtown or at bloor west village no need to come up here just for Vesuvio ... there are better choices to be found in those areas (see my other reviews)"}
{"text":"I have been coming to VESUVIO for last 5-6 years. Today I took my wife and daughter for lunch there. At the door we had very rude encounter with  older obese lady who was \"host\" I can only assume. She took long time to figure out which table is not RESERVED.  She started making very stupid remarks about stroller taking too much place. She looked undone with sleeveless shirt showing unattractive extremely fat arms. Lady was miserable and sweating.  The only reason we stayed is that my wife really enjoys the food here (which is better than average, however it does not match the high price). Waiter was a sweet young man and his service was impeccable I will never be back here because of the old lady ( she must be grandmother of the owner) that's not how you treat well paying/well tipping costumer.   To management: do yourself a favor remove obese old lady from \"host\" position. She is rude unattractive and extremely unprofessional."}
{"text":"Hands down best pizza in the city whether delivery, takeout or eat in. Actual food when you eat in besides pizza was ok."}
{"text":"The food is consistently decent here but the service is terrible. I have been multiple times and have been ignored at the table and unable to find our server on more than one occasion. We waited over an hour and a half between arriving and getting our food, I love the pizza and will get take out but I would not go back to the restaurant to dine-in. The waiter didn't seem to care about us at all, it was quite a bad experience for the whole table of us."}
{"text":"Great lasagna, service is hit and miss. Worth going for an Italian fix."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant if your looking for a well made pizza. The Margherita pizza they make has been one of the best I've had. The pasta dishes are up to par but just don't quite have that wow to it. The taste is good but you may need to season it, I free as if the pasta could use a little work. The ambience is fantastic. You walk in and you get that dinner by a candle feel back in room under the stars. The staff is well trained the can be a bit overwhelmed on busy nights so expect a little wait time before you get served  Overall 4 stars for the excellent pizza the stunning ambience and the well trained staff."}
{"text":"We used to go to, and order from Vesuvio a fair bit, but the quality & service began slipping a few years back.  Each time we've returned its re-affimed our thought that it's not all its cracked up to be.  Given that pizza is their mainstay, it' was surprising to me that The Star rated it as one of the city's best.  Not!  Granted, the pizza is better than most major chains (PizzaPizza, Dominos, etc), only maginally, and its not as good as it could be. Its definitely better eaten in-house than delivered. The pizza takes on the taste of the cardboard box by the time it arrives at your house. It doesn't help having to deal with the surly delivery man, who gets even more surly if he's not handsomely tipped!  The serving staff in the restaurant varies from 'pleasant', to 'would rather be doing anything else', generally erring towards the latter.  Caesar salad is 'ok', nothing special. Pasta is not bad, but still 'family restaurant' quality.  Given that it's a neighbourhood family restaurant, I was apalled to hear that they refused to host T-Ball team's season-end party last year.  We went to Boston Pizza instead for that (ughh).  All in all, I'd generally say it's \"average\"."}
{"text":"The food is good but I find is heavy and the presentation I find is mediocre. The atmosphere is very stereotypical Italian restaurant. I'm mainly writing this review however to mention how expensive the food is. It's ridiculous for average food you can find at any Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"I have never dined in at Vesuvio.  This review only regards the delivery service.  NB: despite some negative criticism it should be noted that I still order from Vesuvio on occasion.  As a Roncie resident, I've ordered from Vesuvio on a number of occasions and found the result to be quite inconsistent.  The pizza ranges from well topped and pretty well prepared all the way to scantily topped cardboard.  All in all, I don't much care for the pizza.  (The secret to any place is CONSISTENCY!  Which this place lacks.)  However, I am somewhat impressed by their delivery pasta.  Even after travelling, it generally arrives al-dente-ish and the sauces are pretty good.  Definitely overpriced.     The delivery is usually fair-paced and courteous.  However, I have had ONE pretty bad experience (I see from other reviews that I am not alone).  The driver arrived 90 minutes after the order was made with no apology.  He grabbed the money I offered and did not offer change (I was planning on letting him keep it anyway, a generous tip, but was miffed at the assumption) then took off speedily.  I had to call after him to remind him that he had forgotten half my order.  He huffed his breath in annoyance at me (a projection, I'm sure, of his frustration with a hard night's work but still: not my baggage to heft) and returned at a jog with a bag that he deposited on the porch at my feet before turning abruptly and taking off.  In the end, we were STILL two drinks and a salad short, I paid full price plus a 12% tip, and the food that did make it to our table, incidentally, was the worst I've ever gotten from them; pizza with hardly any sauce or toppings and an order of spaghetti about half the size of their usual portion.  Clearly, not good at dealing with heavy business.  Vesuvio.  Get. It. Together!  Work on consistency.  You could be a great place instead of resting on your historic laurels."}
{"text":"OMG great food and service!!! I found this place through yelp, and I have to say best choice to come here. My friend got the lasagna and I had a taste of it and wow best restaurant made lasagna. Fresh and hot. I got the veal scaloppini and the veal was so tender and the veggies was great. I saw other tables ordering pizza and they look amazing! Will definitely be coming back and recommend to everyone who loves and craves a good pizza, pasta, or even veal. Yum!!!!"}
{"text":"We came for late dinner on a Saturday night, had made reservations although we really didn't need to.  I was disappointed to see only one pasta & seafood dish on the menu, which came with every kind of seafood so I probably wont order it again.  We all ordered pasta dishes and were happy with both the food & service, although the wine selection could be better (even though I was told on the phone it was 'extensive' it was quite the opposite of that!).  We will definitely try the pizza next time!"}
{"text":"Une véritable institution à Toronto. Lors de leur 40e anniversaire, ils ont donné de la pizza gratuitement toute la journée ! Vous avez ici côte à côte une pizzeria à emporter italienne où l'on peut aussi commander des sandwichs avec une escalope de veau ou des boulettes de spaghetti et à côté un restaurant classique avec un menu complet.   Situé dans le quartier de Dundas West, Vesuvio mérite le détour ! Non seulement vous pourrez y déguster une tranche de pizza classique, vous pourrez discuter de foot avec les propriétaires ou le personnel. Surtout n'y parlez pas trop de Zidane ;-)"}
{"text":"My friend and I were walking around the Junction and decided to come here for lunch.  We ordered carbonara pasta and the primavera pizza.  The pizza was so amazing!  Hands down the best pizza I've ever had even though I'm such a huge meat lover.  The waitress there was really helpful and really made sure we were taken care of.  Will definitely be going again."}
{"text":"Best pasta in the west end by far! Love love love their ravioli and will always come back to eat. Perfect for a first date. Very reasonable prices for such an awesome meal."}
{"text":"I only do delivery from here, but every time I do it's hot and way above average for pizza delivery.  Recommend the Volcano, but good choices throughout the menu.  I've tried other things here, not really worth the mention.  Stick with the pizza and you'll enjoy.  If in the delivery area, try it once you'll convert."}
{"text":"How this place gets the reputation for best pizza is beyond me, not to mention there veal sandwich is tough as leather , the sauce tastes like it comes out of a can.. One time i ordered there seafood pasta, which is not bad, not great but not bad.. I asked for a little extra sauce on my seafood pasta because the last time it was a bit dry, what there so called chef did was just add a couple dollops of there meat sauce to my seafood pasta, disgraceful! The final and last time I ordered a pizza from them, they screws up my order, I politely called them back to let them know, I spoke to the owner and he would not accept the fact they made a mistake and actually had the balls to tell me it was my mistake in the way I ordered it and would not exchange my pizza! This place is so overhyped and there customer service is appalling!"}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time and I really liked it. I had the cheese ravioli and it was tasty and filling. It may be a bit expensive here, but it was worth it. I would love to come back again. Maybe I might try gnocchi next time. The food is definitely authentic. The service was pretty good. The decor is lovely. Another place in the Junction where you can bring a date."}
{"text":"I have had so much pizza in my life. I love pizza. This pizza is the BEST pizza in the city, in my opinion of course. So incredible. Just everything you want in a pizza, they have it, and excel at it every damn time. Delivery, dine in, or take out, this place never fails."}
{"text":"Had the chicken parmesan. Chicken was tough and overcooked. I like my pasta al dente, but the penne was undercooked even for me.  Tried my partner's pizza, and that was much better. Great crispy crust and tasty toppings. (We ordered some at a later date, and for some reason the delivery version wasn't as good, and was definitely not very good when reheated later.)  Service was pretty fast considering how busy it was.  It was noisy in there, but I'm not sure there's a way to control that.  I'll definitely go back for the pizza, and maybe try other dishes. No more chicken parmesan, though.  chicken parmesan C+ penne B- pizza A-"}
{"text":"I was up there to enjoy some lunch with my fellow coworkers. The Italian spot was on my list to check out in the area, you will have to find parking on the street and pay up as the restaurant does not have their own parking. Once you walk in the restaurant, it`s pretty extravagance and nice. The server was friendly.  Looking at the menu I went with their paninin section and ordered their grilled vegetables sandwich which comes with eggplants, zucchini, roasted red peppers, asiago served on toasted Vienna bread. I also added caramelised onions to the mix for an extra charge. It was more of a Baguette sandwich which tasted amazing but the bread was a little too hard.   I also ordered a cappuccino and enjoyed it. Overall, average to decent restaurant."}
{"text":"This is my favourite pizza place in the Junction. I almost always order delivery but the one time I dined in it was a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"i've always been a take out customer, sometimes dine in, tried delivery recently, all good... the sandwiches start around $5 at take out and dine in specials change daily"}
{"text":"Its real good food. It's good grub and its excellent excellent service. Always been here, will be here forever. You'll likely be dead before this place goes out of business. Eat lots. Bueno appetito!!! ciao!!!'"}
{"text":"Good pizza definitely not great pizza.    Take out service is awful.  They act like they don't want to be there.  I'm gonna act the same way and take my money elsewhere.  It's amazing this place has eight 1 star reviews in the filtered section but not one of those 1 star reviews factor into this establishments over all status.  If they did, maybe Vesuvio's would return to form and put care back into their product and their service.  Unfortunately YELP's filter system doesn't want people in the Junction to know that Vesuvio's is no longer is as great as it once was."}
{"text":"I came across Vesuvio quite randomly while exploring my new High Park neighbourhood.  For its eloquent and unpretentious ambiance (specifically I'll point out my appreciation for the interesting art on the walls), excellent food and reasonable prices, Vesuvio has become one of my dining favorites.   As far as the food goes, I've had only parts of the vegetarian selection. The vegetarian lasagna is excellent, and I've had it a couple times. My only critique of it being that the noodles are a bit softer than I would normally prefer. I'm certain many would applaud the smooth, creamy texture. Everything I've had at Vesuvio has tasted of discernibly better ingredients than you'll often find. The joy of biting into food with fresh ingredients is a far too rare experience when dining. I recommend the bruschetta. I may often mispronounce it, but I order it every time I'm there.   A whole other side of my love for Vesuvio is ordering pizza from them. Their pizza has great, flavourful toppings with thin ungreasy crust. They are a bit more expensive. For a large pizza with several toppings and taxes, it'll be just under $25. My take: I'd rather have less pizza, and love it when I do, than eat pizza from the vast majority of Toronto's offerings. I moved to Toronto 8 years ago, and have struggled with the pizza places here. There are many, and they are lacking (reviews to come..). Vesuvio finally satiates my need for an occasional order-in pizza place!  Update: I had a bad experience with their pizza delivery... our apartment buzzer was not working, but they said this wouldn't be a problem - the delivery person would simply call when he was nearby, and I offered to meet him in the lobby. Sounded good. An hour later, I get a call from the restaurant - they claimed he had been calling me and couldn't get through. Absolutely false. I pointed out that the restaurant got a hold of me easily - he must've had the wrong number. When I went down to meet him, he was angry with ME. \"Why weren't you picking up my calls??!!\" I tried calmly explaining he hadn't called me, but he was having none of it. I paid, and should not have, but did tip him. I regret that, and not calling immediately to complain about being verbally assaulted by their delivery person, who provided me with cold pizza. That simply doesn't meet my standards when I pay for slightly upscale pizza. I'm not saying I won't go back, because really good pizza is a rare find, but it did undermine my confidence in this aspect of their business."}
{"text":"We were actually heading to another Italian spot when we passed Vesuvio. I was so hungry I told my  husband let's just go here.   We parked on Dundas and you can just smell the food lingering outside the restaurant. At that point I knew I made a good decision to go there. I think I began to walk faster, not only was I hungry but the smell was amazing. Picture the cartoons where they start floating in the air when something smells good. That was me. In my head I felt like I was floating.   Walk in without a reservation (which I recommend) to a very packed house. Luckily we were able to get a table right away \"whew.\"  Authentic Italian spot with a really nice cozy, family atmosphere.   Followed the waitress to our table as the seating is pretty close to your neighbor. Let's just hope it's not a sneezing or coughing neighbor when you go there.   As usual I ordered a really nice fruity drink ( I honestly can't remember the drink but when I go back I'll edit this) and baked ravioli, beef & cheese along with a side ceasar salad. My husband had the chicken ceasar salad.  I was extremely hungry because when that ceasar came out, I tow it up like there was no tomorrow. I ate so fast I couldn't finish my main course. I took three bites of my beef & cheese baked ravioli (which was sooo delicious) and I was done. We weren't there for a long time but we were there long enough to notice the beautiful pictures and decor on the wall around the restaurants.   One of our favs!! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Amazing Service !!! Best Pizza ever. Ive dined in and taken out . I was happy both times. Love the family atmosphere and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Worst food ever !!!! Their pizza taste s like delissio  pizza !!! Service was good but was disappointed by the food after seeing such an amazing ratings..."}
{"text":"Always enjoy Vesuvio for takeout pizza, and dining in is a predictable casual stop.  Nice place for the whole family!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Delivery came right on time, and it was super hot! Delivery guy was also very friendly. I for sure recommend, literally so good I can not put it into words! Prices are also reasonable. Amazing!!!!!"}
{"text":"Mmm every time my boyfriend and I come here we always end up going back to our usual dishes - penne a la vodka and fettucini creamy pesto. The pasta is cooked perfectly and the sauces are amazing. The portions are decent and we always have leftovers to take home. The service is usually good, no complaints.  The last time we were here was on Valentine's. The restaurant seemed understaffed as our server was taking care of us, neighbouring tables and a huge party. It took awhile for him to come around each time but understandably so. My only complaint is that my boyfriend asked to add grilled shrimp to his dish and it came out with THREE shrimps. And he got charged $6 for it which is ridiculous. We didn't bother saying anything but hopefully next time the kitchen will pay more attention and not be so stingy."}
{"text":"I've had their pizza, delivered, at least once a week for the past three years. Hands down, it's my favourite in the city."}
{"text":"Here's what you need to know:  If you're in the junction, this is the only place that isn't over an hour wait and there's probably a reason for that...  1. Ceasar salad: family size is $3.50 more but double the size. What's with the bottle sauce. This is an Italian place and you can't make your own sauce? Let me into the kitchen, I'll do it for you...  2. Bruschetta... ummm huge slices of bread with tomato and basil. The basil is very fresh but really? Tomato on bread. No wonder it wasn't expensive. If I were to fix this dish. Balsamic vinegar, garlic and onions... at least I could add my own vinegar  3. Made my own pizza. Extra sauce translated to less sauce. And the crust is too thick and oily. It could be deep dish...  Next time, I'll wait the hour elsewhere."}
{"text":"I've always been skeptical of this place, it seems so out of date with the other trendy estabishments that are popping up on the street, but 50 yelpers with 4 star reviews can't be that bad.  The place is a simple family restaurant. Bring your kids, bring the parents, everyone comes here and is welcome.   The food was pretty good. I just got the speghetti carbonara, which was made simply and to perfection. Just they way it's supposed to with no twists, with bacon, egg and parm. My mom got the chicken marsala - which I didn't like very much, but chicken breast isn't my fave either - it was dry and the sauce was a bit too riich - but she loved it.   Extremely affordable with my pasta running at $12,50 and the chicken and $20. Maybe even pricier than a certain new italain restaurant down the street.   But now Iknow where I can go for my pasta carbonara fix.   Seems like their pizzas are pretty good too. There's always a line up for the take out area adjacent."}
{"text":"Best pizza on the planet! La vita est bella!"}
{"text":"I just enjoyed a nice quiet dinner at Vesuvio tonight. This was my first dine-in experience, as all the other times I've been there the restaurant has been packed and so I just resorted to ordering take-out pizza.   It was a pretty solid meal on all fronts. The service and staff were quick and friendly. The portions were sizeable and reasonably priced. It was not out of this world amazing but it hit the spot.  I ordered (what seems to be) exactly what Kat \"Yelp Guru\" F. had, the gnocchi with tomato sauce. I like having simple dishes at Italian restaurants because I think it is a true test of the establishment to taste their tomato/basil sauce unpolluted by other ingredients.  Before you go thinking I'm some mangiacake, I'd like you to know that I dated an italian guy and his italian family for many years. His Nonna's gnocchi and tomato sauce was to die for and might have artificially extended the relationship by years.  Before ordering I inquired as to whether the gnocchi was made in house(affirmative) and confirmed that the minestrone soup($6) is vegetarian. I didn't order the soup though because I knew I couldn't eat it all. There are plenty of vegetarian choices here because they have a 'make-your-own' pasta/pizza format.  My gnocchi was fresh and shaped into small simple rectangles. The tomato sauce was just ok, definitely not at nonna level and maybe a little heinz-ish but overall the whole thing was decent and I cleared my plate (sort of abnormal for me). I think they must have had someone else in the kitchen when Kat F. was there because I would go back and try some of their other dishes.  Special mention for my server, a young italian guy who knew the 50+ year history of the restaurant and neighbourhood. For those who don't know, the Junction used to be a dry zone, which caused a major depression in the area rendering Vesuvio into a take-out pizza joint for 16 years. Now that the liquor has been flowing for almost a decade the whole area is on the up."}
{"text":"The pizza & panini where delivered within the 1 hour window, for which I was told they would be delivered.pizza was tasty and has an authentic Italian flavour while catering to the dare I say designer pizza style(I got Hawaiian)"}
{"text":"We went here for the first time and we really enjoyed ourselves. The staff were very attentive, it was noisy but you could still have a conversation, and there was a great mix of people - families, locals, parties and couples. The food was really good too. The baked ravioli with arrabiata sauce was yum. The pizza was good and seemed to be a favorite. The salad special they had was excellent as well. Oh and leave room for dessert... the double chocolate fudge tart was fabulous.  We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Solid Italian restaurant.  Service was good.  Food was good as well.  After doing take out once and eating in once, I would say that eating in is a much better experience.  Italian food just tastes better rolled out fresh on a plate.  The decor is dated by today's standards, but nice and suits the restaurant and it's clientele.  Sauce (or gravy) is very good.  Pasta is cooked right.  Cheeses are good as well.  When I was waiting for take out, i tried a pizza slice and it was a bit disappointing to me.  Not sure if the one you order tastes better but it has more to do with the dough.  It uses the spongier dough which some people love.  I personally prefer the less spongy dough with my pizza.  It's just personal preference and not a knock to the quality.  Overall a decent Italian restaurant.  And can understand why it's been around so long.  I will be back."}
{"text":"I love the fact that the have Italian beer on draft! most Italian restaurants only have bottles.  Now for the Pizza! just really good pizza, amazing well let's just saying will go back but I have had better."}
{"text":"This may be the best pizza in the city. What I love is that they have sit-down restaurant for a more fancy pizzeria style but still have the normal pizzeria for a simple slice, take-out, or delivery. And they're all fantastic in their own way!  I visited the restaurant for lunch and there seemed to be only one server to do just about everything (host, serve, bus, etc.) I just wanted to note that with like 9 tables she did a fantastic job. It's great to see a restaurant clearly way busier than they expected but they still pulled it off."}
{"text":"I regularly order delivery from Vesuvio and have always enjoyed their pies. They arrive hot and delicious and have a good variety of toppings both traditional and gourmet. It's not super-thin trendy pizza and it's not fast food pizza - just fabulous old school New York style pizza. They claim to be the oldest pizzeria and spaghetti house which is kinda cool too."}
{"text":"Vesuvio's has been well loved by those in the neighbourhood for a long time... a long, long time. They opened in 1957 and we've been eating there for 7 years! This Italian-American restaurant offers some wonderful comfort foods, this isn't high-end Italian, it's more what you'd find at an Italian family's home in Brooklyn, simple but rich in flavors and delicious. We find the prices quite reasonable, both for food and wine. We'll go over delivery and dine-in.  Delivery: The delivery is delicious! Big portions of pasta: I love their Ravioli, Gnocchi and Tortellini. You can get your choice of sauces (meat balls, rose, pesto, frutta di mare, clam or alfredo). There's also lasagna so big one person never manages to finish it, Canneloni and Manicotti. The sandwiches are huge, we've only ever had the veal cutlet and have no need to try the others because we love this one. The thin-crust pizza uses fantastic cheese and tomato sauce, and all the ingredients are fresh. Even a straight up pepperoni is wonderful, they curl up and blacken around the edges a bit, giving a bit of crunch when you bite in and forming lovely pockets of grease that explode with awesome flavor. We day-dream about their pepperoni. We're a huge fan of their Volcano pizza, hot peppers, hot capicollo and hot Italian sausage. For 7 years We've ordered the delivery and will admit that sometimes the delivery men can be a bit off-putting but most of the time they're fine. The delivery here is crazy busy, so you might want to avoid the typical rush times. If you want to guarantee the pizza is as hot as possible consider pick-up, but you have to find street parking. We tend to tag team, one person drives the other runs in and grabs the pizza! It's just so popular you really gotta get it down to an art.  The Restaurant: We've only recently just stepped foot into the restaurant itself, I've been so addicted to the delivery we never got around to it. The ambiance is a casual, and pretty, not a bad place for a casual date as it has charm. They seem to have a lot of specials on the weekends. Even on days where everything else in the neighborhood is slow this place is humming with activity.  Appy's: Bruschetta is unique here, they take a very fresh tasting approach. The tomatoes are diced and drizzled with olive oil at the end, so it's not wet, and the fresh taste of the tomato really comes through. Parmesan is freshly grated on and instead of basil they use parsley, again adding to that garden fresh taste. The crostini was perfect, great baguette nicely toasted and still soft and hot on the inside. The spiced olives are MARVELOUS. They're done in-house and have a lovely spicy kick to them, with bits of rosemary. We adored these!  Entree: So far we've only had the veal while eating in, and will update the review once I've had more. We can say the veal was good quality and well cooked, with generous portions. The lemon butter sauce is well balanced, too many places over-do the lemon, but not here! Shrimp is cooked perfectly, still crunchy and naturally sweet. The scaloppini is prepared with two kinds of mushrooms and was delicious, loved the sauce and there's lot of sauce so make sure you get some bread for mopping. We did find the sauce a touch acidic, but nothing a nice bold red wine doesn't round out. The veggies are cooked properly, they're heated through but still crunchy. The potatoes ARE AWESOME! They've got a great garlic flavour and roasted to the point of being caramelized, so so so good."}
{"text":"Ordering for years great food. Too bad the service doesn't match the food. Ordered a pizza at 5p.m. on a snowy day. Understanding that it would take a little longer than expected. Called back 1hour 45 minutes later. They said delivery guy got stuck in the snow we, lost your number and now we are firing up a new pizza. Not impressed but said ok. Thought about it for a minute.... Called back to cancel because now my son has to be in bed in 5minutes and I am too hungry to wait maybe another hour. Call back to cancel, not angry at this point. i get it things happen. the woman yells unreal and slams the phone. Nice. I wasn't angry until that point. Now I'm pissed. Great customer service. I understand the weather and the situation but I should be able to cancel without the attitude. Beside they didn't even have time to restart my pizza."}
{"text":"Gave this place a try because I always walk by and it ALWAYS smells super good. Like amazingly enticingly good - if anything, come for the free smells (Jimmy Johns, anyone?) The thing is, the pizza is just so - so...it's nothing to write home about but nothing to complain about, either. Not very memorable. We also tried a mushroom risotto which I found a bit too salty and mushy :/...again, it wasn't awful, just nothing to go out of your way for. I would try Nodo down the street if you want Italian."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been here for many years.  I've mostly ordered delivery when I worked in the area.  We came on a Saturday between lunch and dinner and so the place was fairly empty.  It seems many of the patron were regulars.  This is a nice family restaurant great to take the kids to.  That's exactly what we did with our 2 little boys in tow.It's décor is not trendy, a bit elegant but yet not stuffy and generally speaking pretty inviting.   Food:  The menu consists of your typical family friendly Italian staples:  bruschetta, spaghetti Bolognese, fried calamari, chicken parm, pizza etc.  We ordered my 5yr old's favourite, fried calamari to start.  We ordered a deluxe pizza, chicken parm with pasta and spaghetti carbonara.  We've frequented Italian restaurants of different forms high end, trendy, family run, no frills...etc.  Although this restaurant poses as a mid end restaurant, it is essentially a no frills Italian eatery.  The food is unpretentious, good old Italian.  The pasta sauce is good, the pizza is good with just the right thickness and toppings, the calamari is fresh.  The service:  Again going back to the good old Italian family restaurants, the service is good.  I can't account for service during the busy schedule but during our experience, it was great.  They were patient with the kids, they were attentive and they were open to some of the substitution requests we made to accommodate the kids.   Why does it warrant the 4 star?  Because in comparison to your daily typical family ran Italian eatery, it is up there.  Yes, it is located in an area that is on the up and up with the trendy spots and high end Italian restaurants are popping up.  It's certainly a great go to for families."}
{"text":"Phenomenal pizza they have here.  Ordered a large deluxe pizza before my ride home.  The dough is fluffy, ingredients are fresh, and the crust is deliciously crispy & crunchy.  Some of the best takeout pizza I've had outside of Italy or New York."}
{"text":"Consistent with quality and delivery times.  The Margherita  pizza is my ultimate favourite here, if you like spicy ask them to add their special hot pepper sauce into the sauce . YUM.  In my opinion The large pizza is perfect, the party sized pizza is not the same quality or as good ."}
{"text":"A better pizza than PizzaPizza, but only by a bit. DON'T get it delivered though. The delivery guy is downright rude, and expects a big tip, despite delivering a cold pizza late!   Also, they should put a liner in the box between the pizza, as the pie takes on a cardboard taste by the time it gets to your door. So now, if & when I order from them, I always pick it up. I gave up on the dining room years ago - serving staff varied between inept and rude. And when they wouldn't let me bring my T-ball team there for a year-end dinner, it was all over. :("}
{"text":"This restaurant is a great Italian joint if your in the mood for great comfort food. Calamari was delicious - breading on point, not too greasy and perfectly cooked, sauce was awesome as well.. And you definitely get quiet a bit of calamari as well. Pizza always has generous amount of toppings, proper cheese pull, crust game on top. Fettuccine creamy pesto was the ultimate comfort pasta for a rainy day- decent amount of chicken, sauce was flavourful with pesto, noodles done well, generous amount of food as well. Overall, I'm always stopping by here when I'm in the area, I've always had a positive experience, at times service is a little slow but I'm patient. On average our food always comes out in a timely fashion and consistent. Would recommend to check this place out fo papa decently priced Italian food."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by this restaurant when my friend and I had planned to go to another restaurant down the street. We had the calamari, penne a la vodka and vulcano pizza and everything was great. The calamari reminded me of calamari from cinque terre in Italy. Best calamari I think I've had in toronto. They even gave us a free dessert for my friends birthday! What impressed us the most is that the waiter was very helpful and really knew Italian cuisine and wine. Great value for great food. The only reason why I wouldn't give it 5 stars is because the ambiance is meh. Not a romantic place and wouldn't recommend it for a date or quiet nice Italian dinner because there  had kids running around everywhere which made the atmosphere really hectic at times and super bright lights. Overall great food and value though"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! Amazing pasta! Impeccable service! Very authentic and the prices are more than reasonable. Lovely place for a date night or even an outing with a group. Going to make it a mission to get here at least once a week!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went for our anniversary cause, what the hell, we both love pasta. It was very mediocre for sure - overpriced, too: $18 for linguine with pesto sauce and chicken. Service was mostly okay. The garlic bread was pretty bland and the garlic itself was barely detectable. Just an overpriced family restaurant. Maybe the fresh pizza is better."}
{"text":"A staple in the junction for a long time. The pizza is very good, this review is based on PIZZA solely.. Not much interest in eating in.  I like the pepperoni's they use a lot! It's usually pretty quick for take out, customer service varies."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from Vesuvio.  I cannot comment on accessibility, gendered bathrooms or cleanliness.  My father was visiting my partner and I and wanted \"good pizza\".  Traditionally, this means a golden, not too thin crust with the dough ball in the middle.  We wanted to order from Frank's House of Pizza, but it was Sunday so it was closed.  Yelp led us to Vesuvio as a reasonable option.  The pizza arrived within 30-ish minutes.  It was not the cheapest pizza but it was totally worth it.  A large pizza with 3 toppings, delivery and 2 sodas was $26.00.  However, the pizza itself was so good that I didn't mind.  I think Frank's is still my favorite pizza place in Toronto, but this is a close second."}
{"text":"I went to this place 4 times this year. the Lasagna is excellent, the sauce couldn't be better. You have to be patient though, they don't precook the food - which is great. But if you are used to superfast-superbad food, don't order Lasagna. Pizza is ok, nothing super spectacular. Prices are a bit steep, but definitely compensate the quality of the food. The place is a bit eclectic, but the atmosphere is ok."}
{"text":"Their calimarri is soooo good. Must try! If eat on Wednesday don't sit by the window. Wednesday happens to be the garbage day and flies would ruin ur meal."}
{"text":"Average pizza...not mind-blowing, not meh. Somewhere in the middle.  We grabbed two late-night slices on the recommendation of a bartender at Junction City Music Hall down the street. One pepperoni, one veg. Both were tasty and satisfying enough, but nothing that would have us running back."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza for pick from here on Saturday night and it was phenom. Super hot and fresh with a light doughy crust. I could tell the ingredients were very fresh and the toppings were generous. A little expensive ($28 for a large) but worth it! This will be our only pizza place from now on!"}
{"text":"My first run-in with Vesuvio's was when I lived in the area.  I decided to take a walk down another side street to get to work on a day that turned out to be Recycling Day.  Every house on High Park Avenue had a blue box out by the curb in front of it, and every one, without exception or hyperbole, had a Vesuvio's pizza box sticking out of it.  That is lid advertising at its best.  Known for its delivered pizza, Vesuvio's has flirted with the in-restaurant dining for a while.  It began as a pizzeria, then expanded into a full restaurant, then it went back to just take-out pizza again, and now it appears to have come back in full force to offer both.  It does huge business in thick crust pizza with fresh and great tasting toppings and if you feel like sitting in, you're more than welcome to.  The dining area is fairly simple and the foods coming out are equally simple but tasty.  I don't live in the area anymore but every time I visit and go to Vesuvio's, I end up wishing I had the option to recycle their boxes again."}
{"text":"My Favorite Pizza Place in Toronto by Far! Amazing Italian Pizza! So Delicious! I recommend this pizzaeria to anyone that wants a Taste of Italy! Service is Quick and The Staff is Amazing! I always keep on coming back!"}
{"text":"That pizza is the real deal! Tastes exactly like my Italian neighbour used to make! Service was friendly and quick. As per the person at the take out , this was the first pizza place in the city.  Really positive vibes from this place and the pizza is not to be missed!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is comfortable, and there is great parking right in front the place.    The server was great the the food was awesome.  Just be sure to bring good company!  BTW - The left over food was yummy the next day!"}
{"text":"Bom Bom de Dom Dom Dom Vesuvio.  This place is at the geographic and restaurant epicenter of The Junction, which hopefully some day, will mean something more than it does now.  I have been to Vesuvio a few times.  Here are the main points...  1. The pizza is very good, but I would not call it great.  It has been granted (somewhere) the title of \"Best Pizza in the City\".  Perhaps, if you consider Toronto a mediocre pizza town.  2. The place has the feel of what would pass as a nice date place on Jerseyliscous.  It has a certain casual charm about it without being classy.  3. Vesuvio features both a take out area and a main dining area that are completely separate.  If you want to get take out in your pajamas, no worries.  4. Service is slow and clumsy at times, but not in a way that makes your blood boil.  (Unless you are the type that gets angry as the glass of wine begins to take effect). The servers are generally friendly and seem to be making a genuine effort.  5. If it seems a little fancy sounding or difficult for a 10 year old to pronounce, don't order it.  The lasagna (which takes forever to prepare) is well worth it.  The spaghetti and pizza also taste very good.  Most other things can be hit or miss.  Swim at your own risk.   6. Vesuvio has a decent bar and ample selection of wine and beer.  7. The prices here are average to maybe a bit high.  This is not the cheapest place in town.  Expect to pay $30-$35 per person with a glass of wine.  Overall, I would give this place 3 1/2 stars.  Once you know what you like here, it is a comfortable place to visit more than once."}
{"text":"There are lots of places that (for me) fall between average and very good and this is one of them. It was our first time here and we thought we'd try it out. The (awesome female) server who greeeted and seated us (despite that fact that we were 15 minutes early to the posted opening time) was super friendly, helpful and welcoming. She couldn't have been nicer! Our server was good too. As far as the decor - it's like the old 70's trattoria interiors that some of us grew up around, but it's comfy, we were seated right by the window. I had the risotto special (with asparagus, sausage and shrimp) he had the Pizza Bella (pesto, artichoke hearts, asiago) and it was GREAT! I know quite a bit about the complexities of risotto and unfortunately, there was no flavour in the risotto itself and the rice was still crunchy. Disappointing, since the whole point is for the rice to absorb all of the wine/broth/flavours that it is slowly being simmered with. And that was an $18 disappointment. The sausage and shrimp were flavourful, but that's not the point.  The prices weren't cheap, but I'd maybe try it out one more time."}
{"text":"Fresh salad crunchy wi great homemade vinaigrette .Pizza nearly flakey crisp crust ;outstanding on site. Pecorino Italian white a great foil.Try Pizza Bella!Pastas not quite la Fenice. Staff great!!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza. I've always ordered delivery, except for once when I dined there with a friend. The dine-in menu is much more extensive than the take-out menu. I've tried ordering non take-out items and they don't allow it.   I have always had great food and OK service, except for one time when my order was taken by a very rude woman over the phone. Luckily I haven't come across her since.   My go-to is the Hawaiian pizza. There's something sweet about the tomato sauce that I just love. The Sausage Penne with Rose sauce is also a favourite in my household. I often ask for parmesan as I love it on my pizza too, as well as their special spicy hot pepper sauce for dipping.   Save your delivery receipts - they have a rewards program for free pizza after you order a certain amount."}
{"text":"Nice family restaurant. Had the risotto LA fungi and tried a apple salad special. Both were very good abit pricy for the meal but I would come back again"}
{"text":"It was 9pm, I had just gotten off a plane from Vancouver and - after 6 hours in transit without food - I was starving.  I needed to find food ASAP in the Junction area, and Vesuvio was the first place I passed with a free table.   Stepped inside and was pleasantly surprised, the atmosphere was buzzing and the wine was flowing.  Plenty of appies, pastas, and pizzas to choose from with exciting sounding flavor combinations.  My friend and I ordered the caesar salad (boring, I know) and the proscuitto-arugula pizza to share.  Both dishes took FOREVER to come out, however they were worth the wait.  if you like thin crust pizza, you will love this.  The crust was garlicky and crispy while the toppings were fresh.  Our salad and pizza were plenty for the appetites of 2 girls - we even took home two slices for lunch the next day.    This is a solid place for a satisfying meal.  Family friendly and (relatively) hip all at the same time."}
{"text":"This review is for the party size take-out pizzas.  They are da bomb!  For some reason the crust on the party size far exceeds the other sizes.  I have no idea why and don't care - because the quality of this pizza is consistent and it's damn tastee.  Ordering a pizza - upsize - you will noy be sorry."}
{"text":"Came here in the summer and all I could remember were there were flies everywhere! I don't know if something is rotting in this restaurant but we could not stop shooing them away during our whole meal. Would not come back here"}
{"text":"I've lived in the neighbourhood for most my life and never stepped into Vesuvios. Now that I'm not in the area, my friends thought it would be a good idea to check it out on Friday night.   When we arrived, it was pretty busy, and luckily my friend made a reservation. We were seated comfortably in a booth and checked out the menu. My friend and I decided on splitting the calamari app as well as a Deluxe Pizza. Sharing gives you about 3 slices each which is a good amount with an appetizer. My other friend ordered bruschetta with chicken alfredo. When we were greeted by our servers he brought us waters right away. Then after a bit our appetizers came. Before I talk about food, one thing I noticed is that our table was the only table who did not get any bread. Not sure why that is and I couldn't find my server to ask for any. I thought maybe because we had appetizers we didn't get any but I noticed another table with appetizers and bread.   The bruschetta was really good. Baguette was nice and crisp, the tomato mixture was tasty. Our calamari was good too. I loved the marinara sauce that came with it! Our mains came shortly after that and I would have to say the pizza was so good! I really loved the thin crust, and the dough was very different from the typical pizza I've had. I'd have to say the pizza was the highlight of the evening. My friend was a bit disappointed with her chicken alfredo. She was sprinkling parmesan cheese from the shaker that was given to us and had to open the lid to get more...but I noticed all the other tables who ordered pasta received a little bowl of parm with a spoon. Soooo not sure why we didn't get one?  Towards the end I felt like my server was non existent. We were all thirsty and needed water. Finally when he came by and asked if we wanted our bills we got water. Don't get me wrong, he was nice and we still left him a decent tip, but I just wish we got our waters topped up more often and the bread and parm missing kind of stuck out in my mind.   I'll definitely come back for some delicious pizza but maybe next time I'll opt for take out."}
{"text":"How's this for a night out? A Kir Royale cocktail, a bottle of Valpolicella, topped with Calamari Fritti and Bruschetta for Antipasti, Caesar Salad insalata, Gnocchi and Risotto Con Funghi, finished with a Cappuccino or Espresso and Tartufo. #squadgoals"}
{"text":"I had an early lunch today at Vesuvio.  I used to order pizza from them when I moved to Toronto in 1987 and haven't had their pizza in many years.  I was in the area today and thought I'd stop in.  I love love love pizza and ordered one (personal pizzas are 11 inches) with pepperoni, bacon and pepperoni.  It was a good hearty pizza.    It was fairly busy when I left about 12:30pm."}
{"text":"I read somewhere that this is the best meatball sandwich in Toronto.  It is definitely the best value ($5 for a large sandwich, 50 cents extra for cheese or other toppings), but the taste was bland.  The meatballs were just balls of meat with no seasoning.  The tomato sauce was also underseasoned.  The sauce, the meatballs, or both definitely could have used salt, pepper, and garlic.  The bun also baked too long in the oven and the edges were burnt.  The cheese was the delicious, stringy pizza mozarella, which definitely added to the texture"}
{"text":"We've been to this place several time it has good service and good food.  Called to make reservations for the first time and was greeted by an unfriendly women.  Apparently they ask for a credit card upon reserving?  Never heard of that before."}
{"text":"This is the BEST pizza in Toronto!  It's a little more expensive than the regular chain pizza places, but its worth it.  The crust is incredible... and i highly recommend getting the spicy italian sausage on it! DELICIOUS!  Personally i prefer to go for the take-out at this place, the restaurant is okay but nothing special... just your average everyday Italian place.  And I find it slightly more pricey than it should be for the value of the food... but then again I'm a dive bar loving individual."}
{"text":"This was a late night pizza run after a few drinks with friends. By best friend and I used to do the same down on Queen West after clubbing and we had a tradition of getting the same pizza from the same joint. This pizza had a pesto sauce, sundried tomato, chicken, and mushrooms. Vesuvio didn't quite have something exactly the same, but it was close and quite good. This brings back some great memories. I would love to come and try a sit down meal here because by the looks of the place and the other reviews, this is a good place."}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite Italian restaurant ! I love Vesuvio and go there frequently since I live in the area. Pizza is amazing, gnocchi pasta is so good, and the chicken plate with potatoes and veggies are delicious! Bread is given to you with a side of oil , sooo good! Also the calamari for an app is great. I always ask for them to make it extra crispy, it comes with a side sauce which I believe is just regular salsa sauce but it compliments it very nicely. All the waitresses and waiters are so sweet. I unfortunately don't remember the females name but do remember the male server, Shane - very nice, and funny  the prices are alright, but the food is definitely filling"}
{"text":"Showed up after we were misinformed about availability at NODO (party in progress) and were welcomed to a warm busy place.  Four adults and two children...no reservation and soooo nice to us.   My carbonara was excellent.  Bacon was perfectly smokey.  Also no complaints about the baked ravioli, gnocchi, penne or manicotti.  Pizza was perfect for a young hungry hockey player who had a game coming up. It was one of the children's birthday so they brought his yummy chocolate dessert with a candle in it for him.  Staff so nice to the kids. Mixture of families, seniors and young couples.  Reasonably priced wines. Wonderful to have such a great place in the Junction."}
{"text":"As a newcomer to Toronto, I aim to try as many different establishments in a variety of neighborhoods to get to know the culinary measure of this fine city.  I find no benefit in getting comfrotable with the same 4-5 restaurants all within 4 blocks of one another.  What kind of adventure would moving to a new country and city be if you don't live in ALL of it?  All that said, I have twice entered into the oregano aromas offered by the Vesuvio dining room.  True - the inside feels like the owners can't decide whether to dress it up and go full service Italian date-night motif or to focus on pizza, delivery and the local crowd that comes in to dine some nights.  But there's just something nice about walking into a locally owned pizza shop with the smell of a pizza oven in the background inviting diners to give the pie a shot.  Vesuvio's menu is not extraordinarily robust, neither the dinner nor the wine portion.  There is antipasti, pasta dishes, pizza, secondo and dessert.  I'm not sure what 'secondo' means - 'second?'  If so this is appropriate, as those dishes received no more than a second's thought from me.  Vesuvio is light on service (my glass has emptied a few times, and there is a wait to place an order I have decided on 10 minutes in advance), the rolls are bland and, sometimes, cold.  The wine is bargain basement with markeup.    Luckily, Vesuvio does one thing well.  Very well.  They cook a pizza that makes me forget all shortcomings.  All pizzas are served the same in the same size - 11\".  There is one crust option, somewhere between thin and traditional.  It has an excellent firm, olive oil flavour.  I like a crust that is more than a vehicle on which to deliver toppings - bring something to the party!  The pasta sauce is not overpowering but provides a nice tomato zing, and the ingredients list gives a nice selection of traditional toppings (though at a premium).  While none of these are individually special, the sum of whole works perfectly.    Based on some service and pricing issues, I can't in good faith give more than 3 stars (though I want to!).  Vesuvio is definitely a one trick pony, and the price of their pizza signals that they are very aware.  But if you're going to hang your hat on something, make sure you do it right - and at least here, they found that special talent."}
{"text":"Vesuvio's has won me back a little since a couple years ago. I think I had a really bad pie and they're not usually that stale and flavourless.  I like Vesuvio's for their take out slices. At $2.50 for a relatively large square it's one of the better values in Toronto and their slices have always been good. They reheat them for you in the oven so expect to wait a couple minutes. It's partially nostalgia talking because their slices remind me very much of 90s mall-era Mrs. Vanelli's pizza. My memory of this is not great but the texture, crust and cheese combination definitely brings back feelings. Though Vesuvio's sauce is much tastier.   I'm happy to live nearby and be able to pop out for a couple slices when I don't feel like cooking or spending a lot on take out. Service at the take out counter is always friendly. I"}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery, I've had their pizza a few years ago at a friends and thought I'd give it another go. It was as great as I remembered. Ordered two pizzas; a large vegetarian and a party size with mushrooms, onions and ground beef. I can't speak for the party size but the vegetarian was on point, definitely the best pizza I've had in a long time. Hoping to make the trip to the restaurant to sit in and try a few more things in the future !"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Toronto !! Love the volcano pizza nice heat and the Pie exceptional !! The pasta is amazing try the clam pasta you will love it . Service is fantastic and the wine selection and desserts can't be beat !!"}
{"text":"Pizza is good here--better as takeout than dine in from what I remember.  Today I just got a slice and asked that pepper flakes were added---looks like they forgot   Good pizza, affordable.  But they do need to refocus on customer service!  Otherwise Dominoes $5 small pizza seems much more welcoming!"}
{"text":"Roommate called to order a pizza and the rude employee told her that we were banned from ordering from this establishment. We've never called there before, and have been living here two years.   They were unwilling to tell her when this supposed incident happened, or with whom, or whether it was even our apartment or the neighbours' - no info whatsoever. Berated my roommate, who got very upset at being yelled at by a stranger over the phone.  The pizza here may be good, but we'll never know. 1 star for their classless employee, at any rate."}
{"text":"So much hype..so little flavour!  My close friend spoke so highly of this place and well...it was all hype. The pizza is \"meh\" skimpy toppings, bland sauce and crust that could use a little less time in the oven.  We ordered from here twice as I do not believe in one off reviews and always give a chance so that they can redeem themselves. But twice bitten is all they will get from me."}
{"text":"I hesitate to give a one star review as I may have just ordered the \"wrong\" thing but the gnocchi that I was anticipating with great delight turned out to be the biggest takeout blunder I've ever made and makes me hesitate to give Vesuvio another chance. I know pizza is reportedly their thing but the gnocchi was absolute amateur hour and they should not be serving (let alone charging money for!) such a dish.   To make matters worse, the employee on the phone didn't even tell me my total or how long it would take. 45 minutes later, my gnocchi arrived but it was an absolute disaster.   The pasta had absolutely NO flavour, tasted overboiled and bland and had the texture of alphaghetti. The sauce was akin to Hunt's tomato paste - not even a proper, righteous tomato sauce or puree as I had expected and the container of stale Kraft style parmesan cheese that came with the pasta was the ultimate insult. I'm not being dramatic when I say I consumed two forkfuls."}
{"text":"Best. Pizza. Ever. Period! Can't go wrong with pasta either, especially tortellini rose. Vesuvio is a classic - don't miss out."}
{"text":"a new level of pizza is what this establishment pushes out of its doors, i'm not sure how they do the tomato sauce, but its addictive and worth doing extra sauce for. always a pleasure to order from this place. the staff are very nice and the service is excellent.  i'd be afraid to be a pizza business within ten kms of this place, cause it seriously kicks some next level dough."}
{"text":"Portions are huge and food is delicious. Pizza neapolitana is amazing and not to be missed."}
