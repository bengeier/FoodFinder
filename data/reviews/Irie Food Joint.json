{"text":"The Curry Chicken Roti is my favourite dish. It comes with some tasty coleslaw and apple chutney. Coupled with some red stripes and you have a great meal."}
{"text":"Irie food Joint is a mix of traditional Jamaican Cuisine, with a twist of new world Queen St West flavor.  The atmosphere is not typical of a Jamaican Pattie restaurant, there is comfortable seating, a garage door that opens up freely to the street, and soft grooves that keep the atmosphere relaxing. The food is amazing, the staple roti's are available for dine in or take out, or try expanding your palette with some firecracker shrimp as an appetizer! There is one thing that is very reminiscent of the Jamaicans...SPICE! Be prepared to gulp down some milk when experiencing some of the hottest flavors in town. Fair prices, and space to enjoy a small gathering or group make this restaurant a great choice for any dining experience."}
{"text":"I was incorrect: it's going to be Harlem Underground, probably an extension of Harlem Restaurant but as a lounge/resto."}
