{"text":"Stopped in as we were going through town.  Great food.  We will make a special trip to eat here.  Chef very friendly and helpful with menu.  Had roasted root salad, cinnamon chicken, and a special dish from the chef. Food fabulous, decor could be improved."}
{"text":"Second time here for me. I really like the menu and service. It's very eclectic and fresh. I would recommend this place to anyone and in an area like Monroe there are not many options. The specials are also great."}
{"text":"Best food in Monroe! The owner and chef, Jason, cooks up very creative dishes using different styles of cuisine. I've never tasted anything bad here, and their beer and wine selection is impeccable. The wait staff are very friendly and will strike up a conversation with you when they aren't busy. By far one of my favorite places in Union County to get a delicious, well priced meal."}
{"text":"New to Monroe, stopped in to take a look at the menu.  Was totally turned off by the dirty appearance of the male who greeted me when i entered.  Won't be eating there."}
{"text":"Fantastic food!  We had the sweet potato crispers and the queso  dip from the specials menu. Then we shared the pretzel chicken. All of it was absolutely delicious.  The only draw back is the decor.  What an ugly restaurant. Ugly checkered tile and vinyl, but without any theme.  I would go back."}
{"text":"If you happen to be driving to the beach on 74 and are hungry for lunch or dinner, you should stop off and have a meal at BiBi's. I haven't had anything that I didn't love! The salads are all delicious. The yard bird is my 'go to' salad for lunch. The spinach salad is a nice dinner salad and it is delicious. This is by far the best place to get a meal in Monroe!"}
{"text":"YES!
Best Restaurant in town, hands down, no question! I thought I was in San Francisco/Vancouver/Toronto/Dallas/D.C. it was that good! (and I travel to those places regularly.) but this place was AFFORDABLE! 
I was in town a couple weeks ago, visiting extended family. They are very set in their ways and don't like to try new restaurants often...  just my brother, mom, and I ate here the first night. The patio is gorgeous, the service is excellent, and the food is amazing! Brings modern HEALTHY \"city food\" to a small town. It was so good that we came back with my grandparents and the rest of the family the very next night, for dinner. they loved it, and said they will return often!

The Chef/owner blends southern home style cooking with Asian inspiration. two pretty different styles that come together PERFECTLY. Their servers were great, very friendly and attentive. I'd give this plad 10 stars if i could. I was pleasantly surprised! 

If you're in town, or just passing through, give them your business, you won't be dissapointed!"}
{"text":"Good was excellent especially be a dip. It was a Friday date night and the hubby and I really enjoyed both of our chicken dishes as well."}
{"text":"The food was good and even though they were busy, I felt as though the waitress always had me in mind.
His place it teetering on average and above average. They have a lot of potential. I will be back lol!"}
{"text":"Try the chainsaw burger if you are brace enough!  I was skeptical that a burger was the most expensive dish on the menu, but it was delicious but couldn't finish it between two people!!  Went on a Wednesday night and they had live music.  The staff was very nice.  Service was prompt.  The chef was so proud of his \"creation\" (honestly most things on the menu can only be described as creations) that he hand delivered it to out table.  It was the most impressive burger plate I've seen, and well worth the $20 price tag."}
{"text":"Unbelievably tasty! Out adventuring for hubby's birthday and happened to be nearby at lunchtime so (based on yelp reviews) thought we'd try.  OMG!  Menu is creative and diverse - especially at dinnertime - there were many things that sounded good.  Hubby started with a peach/habanero elixir (yum!) and Mama's Cornbread salad.  My mistake was thinking it sounded weird so I (sadly) only got two bites of his, but sincerely I think it was one of the best things I've ever eaten (and we eat out a LOT).  His main was shrimp and grits - I didn't try it, but it looked good and he raved about what an amazing lunch he was having.  I went with the fish tacos.  They're more of an \"assemble yourself\" thing with tomatoes and jalape√±o coleslaw and (at our servers suggestion) a side of Cajun tartar.  Fish was perfectly cooked and more than enough to fill the three corn tortillas with a couple pieces leftover (which I of course devoured).  Fabulous!  I've had many fish tacos before - these are the best I've had anywhere, just wow.  Finished a spectacular meal with the strawberry/rose water/black pepper elixir (again, yum!) and their sopapilla cheesecake.  Cannot recommend this place more, absolutely loved it - and the fact that we were only 30 minutes from home means we're going to be back an awful lot.. Can't wait!  (I'm having that cornbread salad next time!)"}
{"text":"Lunch is delish.  And affordable.  Fish tacos were my pick and I was delighted with the presentation, price, wait time, and the actual food tasted amazing.  I also highly recommend the elixirs, especially the honeydew, cucumber, cayenne elixir.  Sit outside on a nice day under an umbrella and enjoy the food.  Live music there too.  And a great beer list.  If you like good food and are in Monroe, check out historic downtown and have a bite to eat at Bibi!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, and nice atmosphere. We had the Kenji which is a panini with salmon, swiss cheese, spinach, and red onion, as well as the crab cake sandwich. Everything was delicious. Great selection of craft beers too! They also have a  patio to sit outside as well. Service was great!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were lucky enough to be able to get here twice last week!  He was in LOVE with the beer selection (very hard to find in Monroe) select NC and national craft beers.  I was in LOVE with the innovative menu!  

The fried cauliflower with chili sauce was divine.  Not too soft and not to hard - this cauliflower was cooked just right for this Goldilocks!!  Even the grumpiest cauliflower-hater will not be able to help falling in love with the veggie served this way.  We also had the grilled shrimp with chipotle sauce.  The sauce had a mild heat and did not overwhelm the delicious grilled shrimp.  The jalapeno and spinach app was my favorite - served with baked thin pita strips.  The dip had a little more heat due to the jalapeno - YUM!!

I had the Tuna Soba bowl the first night.  Perfectly cooked seared tuna, soba noodles were a delight (not too mooshy) with a great light sauce.  Fresh cored cucumber added just the right amount of crunch to the dish.  I can't wait to go back and get this again!!  The next night I had the seared tuna salad - how fun it was served with tiny yellow potatoes!  Delicious homemade dressings topped off the perfect salad.  It was so much food I couldn't finish it!!

The outdoor patio is perfectly romantic with a gorgeous fountain.  The wait staff is super sweet and the chef/owner Jason makes the rounds to make sure everyone is happy.  Love it here!  You MUST stop in for a big city experience in the middle of tiny Monroe!"}
{"text":"Popped in for lunch on a whim. I was expecting more options on the lunch menu from some of the previous Yelp posters -- but it was mainly your basic lunch/sandwich options with a few entrees (I did see the fish tacos but wasn't craving seafood at the time) mixed in.

Opted for a burger on ciabatta bread -- interesting bread choice. Ingredients were fresh, but the burger was a little dry -- didn't balance too well with the ciabatta. I didn't expect the burger to be their big thing, so I wasn't too upset. French fries were fresh cut and delicious. I liked the uneven cut of the fries, which gave a different taste/crunch to each one. 

Service was fine. The elixirs looked very interesting, I will definitely have to try next time.... probably for dinner."}
{"text":"5 Stars, best in Monroe and I dare someone to dispute this.  I've lived in Monroe for a while now and downtown Monroe is just normally a no-no for anything after 4:00pm and that includes eating.

This place opened back in August apparently and I'm currently kicking myself for not finding it sooner, but again, it's a small town and word of mouth is sometimes slow.

The decor inside is insanely misleading.  No frills and looks leftover from a mix of other places reminiscent of chinese joints.  I literally walked in and immediately thought they served chinese food.  But if you take a moment to walk to the back (where the hostess stand actually is) you will see the fantastic patio.  Cool thing about the patio is that it's squeezed in between two old buildings and you literally feel like you are no longer in Monroe.  It's crazy.  A nice water fountain can be found near a few tables and once the sun goes down the ligthing is very romantic.  I hate to say this but if I couldn't sit outside it would probably factor into whether or not I come here.  

The food, my goodness, the food.  All the dishes are unique and a blend of food not normally served up.  Cauliflower buds dipped in chipotle sauce, chili sauce grilled shrimp and jalepeno spinach dip are just a few appetizer (they call them 'Happytizers') combinations you can have here.  The main entrees are also fantastic.  I had the pretzel crusted chicken over mashed potatoes and vegetable of the day was squash.  So good!!!  So good in fact, my girlfriend and I came back the next night again!  I had the Pasta Melanie the next night and it was equally delish!  Sun dried tomatoes, pasta and perfect cooked chicken.  There's at least one more menu item that caught my eye.  It's called the Chainsaw Burger.  Get this, two grilled cheese sandwiches act as the bun, 14 oz burger and all the typical topings (bacon, etc).  OMG, I love a good challenge!

Last but not least the beer selection is perfect to me.  Monroe is apparently sponsered by mostly domestic and crappy beer.  This place has local craft beer and Bells Two Hearted!  You had me at Bells!"}
{"text":"Interesting variations on some dishes and yay for local business!!  The outdoor dining area is great on a nice day but the tables are quite spread out both inside and outside giving it the ambiance of a restaurant that may not exist the next day."}
{"text":"Went here on a lunch date with my wife. Absolutely blown away by the food."}
{"text":"My wife and I were visiting Monroe, NC, and looking for a local place for good meal on New Year's Eve and called Bi Bi's after reading the reviews in Yelp. We were not disappointed! The location is downtown and pretty unassuming but we are motivated to support resturants like this as opposed to the large chains. The staff was friendly and helpful, the salads were fresh and exceptional and our entrees were delicious and well-prepared. What a find!"}
{"text":"High quality, creative dishes. There are cheaper places to eat in town but, none better. 
My favorite dish is the Cajun Chicken Pasta. You MUST order it with the optional creamy sauce. Yes, it will be more calories but splurge and enjoy the decadance.
They have a buger that must be seen to be believed \"The Chainsaw Burger\" don't order it but if you are lucky someone else in teh restaurant will and your jaw will drop when you see it go by."}
