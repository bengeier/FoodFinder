{"text":"I had a banquet event here and I was quite impressed with the service, as well as the atmosphere. The wait staff was very friendly and was able to keep everyone's order straight, despite the large group.  I ordered a chicken dish that had a creamy sauce, some potatoes, and asparagus. It was a great dish, served hot. It had way more complex flavors than I was expecting. I also tried a bite of the pasta with vegetables.  In a catered, sit down dinner service, I usually don't expect the food to be great or hot, but the Grand Concourse is a nice exception."}
{"text":"No matter how good the food is or how unique the setting, if the service is subpar, the whole dining experience is spoiled. We had a reservation for Sunday brunch at noon. We checked in at the front desk at 11:50 a.m. but were not seated until 12:15 p.m. We specifically requested a table with a view of the river, which we thought would be honored because we were led into that section. However, the maitre d' suddenly stopped walking, looked around, frowned, and said, \"I was misinformed about your table. Give me a minute. I'll find your another table.\" Not sure how that could have happened with a computerized seating system, but never mind. Then there was our server who forgot the milk for our coffees. That in itself is OK, but it took the longest time for him to show up at our table to check on us. So by the time he appeared, our coffees were cold, making them even worse with the cold milk that eventually came."}
{"text":"Place is beautiful! Wonderful view of the river and city! Staff is nice, but could be a little more attentive, at least in the case of my waiter. Myself & BF chose a salad starter (Caesar & wedge) and both were tasty. I ordered the cowboy ribeye which was accompanied by creamy mash potatoes. It was giant (16oz) & so yummy. My bf also ordered a steak, the ny strip, and his was smothered with an onion and mushroom based gravy, also great! My favorite dish however was dessert. We ordered the  chocolate truffle cake, basically a molten chocolate lava cake with French vanilla ice cream topped with Heath bar shavings. Holy moly so GOOD! That was definitely a great end to the evening. The bill was just a little over $100 for 2, but for what we got I thought it was a solid deal, and walked away fully satisfied ;-)"}
{"text":"I was here on November 2011. This is a magnificent old train station converted into restaurant. A true historical jewel in Pittsburgh.  I had a fillet Mignon that was really tender and juicy and very flavorful. I sat outside by the river bank and enjoyed a great of view downtown, the river and its many steel bridges. A very memorable experience."}
{"text":"We were in town for a conference and this was our second night's dinner choice.  We were not seated in the main dining area, but in the area tucked back by the river.  We had a great banquette and a lovely view.  The service started off a little slow but picked up as the meal went on, so that's the minus one star.    The food was great, we all had fish dishes and everyone was happy.  For dessert, we had cannollis and they were fantastic!  Really wonderful.    Overall, it was a great dining experience and while a little pricey, not out of the realm of what you get as far as food and ambiance compared to other citiies in the U.S.    Would visit again when in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Originally being from Pittsburgh, I always viewed the Grand Concourse as one of the city's best restaurants. We dined there with out of town friends last night and left completely disappointed. They were running behind even at 8:45 when we arrived for our reservations. We experienced some of the spottiest and rudest bar service I've ever seen before being seated at 9:30, 45 minutes after our reservation. We ordered our dinners and they took nearly an hour and a half to come out. When they did, the meals were not only bland but came out prepared in different ways than described in the menu. It should also be noted that I've seen cleaner and more well taken care of restrooms at truck stops. At no time in the evening did the manager come around to apologize or attempt to make things better. We left not only disappointed, but also embarrassed for bringing our out of town friends here for a nice evening out."}
{"text":"We went for the Sunday Brunch, which was just ok.    It's about $30/person for the brunch, which I think is fair since it is a buffet and the spread is pretty impressive.  They have everything from a doughnut machine, to omelets, to lunch food and desserts.  BUT, the food just tastes mediocre, so I personally would rather eat less food, that tastes much better.    The building itself is interesting, so that's really the only reason I would recommend going.  The main seating area is very...GRAND haha hence the name, and the side railhouse seating is also really nice and has large windows for a nice view of Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I'm torn. I came here a few years back and I felt like Pittsburgh royalty. It was great, clean, and quick service. Then I came back a few days ago and the waiter was so sloppy; he was covered in stains. He looked like he just wrapped up his shift at Long John Silvers. I ordered the same cherry and bourbon reduction Chilean sea bass dish I ate years ago, but this time they made the rice cheesy and piled on Granny Smith apples. First rule of fish - you don't have cheese with fish. And come on with the apples and cherries piled over a white fish, the tart level was off the charts. I will say that the fish was cooked perfect so that was a plus. And I do like their Sunday brunch. But overall, the quality now does not reflect the hefty price. The building is a Pittsburgh gem, but sadly I think it's nothing more than a tourist trap now."}
{"text":"amazing setting - old railway station?  we love the weekend brunch - kids love to wander around to food stations all over the restaurant - wide variety of food to choose from  attentive service"}
{"text":"Went there with some friends for a birthday.  Terrible dinner, dry fish (supposed to be sautéed) no appearance,just a hunk of fish on a dish, just awful Would never return even if it was for free. Dan. (Jake)"}
{"text":"Writing this after my third trip to the Grand Concourse in Pittsburgh, one of my favorite \"non-chain\" restaurants in the area.  After my family's recent trip to Pittsburgh, they bragged of how amazing this restaurant. After some hesitation, I decided to give this restaurant a try. Would it live up to its name? Oh, yes it did!  While on a leisure trip in Pittsburgh, I decided to wander over to Station Square on Sunday morning for their legendary brunch. Upon arrival, there were several valets, waiting upon the stopping of my vehicle.   Since we forgot reservations, we had to sit in the bar section, so I would highly recommend reservations. Nonetheless, even the bar section (with young children) was memorable. The buffet had everything you could possibly ask for; pancakes and french toast, bacon and ham, primer rib, chicken, rolls, salads, etc.; almost anything you could imagine was on this buffet-even caviar. And at $20 per seat, It was a steal!  So when you travel to Pittsburgh, make sure you check out the wonderful brunch at the Grand Concourse."}
{"text":"It was my first and last visit today. When I arrived the hostess was friendly and asked us where we would like to sit, however she failed to tell us she was seating us next to a large Christmas party.  Okay it is the holidays so we overlooked it. The food was very salty and cold...it seems they are more interested in presentation than taste. Also the portions were small and we're not big eaters. Two of us ordered crab cakes as an entrée and received a small crab cake and lots of rice... we all ordered deserts which were good, but I ordered a cup of coffee which was cold..the waitress Kate never came back. ...very poor food and service - save your money."}
{"text":"I was in Pittsburg for a wedding and I was looking for a place to get brunch with my boyfriend.  I read the reviews on the great concourse, and this place doesn't disappoint.  Great atmosphere, excellent serivce, and it was gorgeous out so we sat outside.  I definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a nice place to eat.  I will defiantly be back next time I'm in Pittsburg."}
{"text":"The brunch buffet here is incredible.  They have everything and I usually end up leaving so stuffed I can't possibly eat anything the rest of the day.  The restaurant is in the old railroad station and it is so scenic and beautiful.  The highlight for me is the fresh donuts from a one of a kind donut machine and the bananas foster made to order.  The donut conveyer pops out fresh donuts for you that are just amazing, and you will want seconds and thirds on the bananas foster.  They have so many options that everyone can find something that they like.  This is a popular brunch spot so make sure you have a reservation."}
{"text":"Ate myself full w lobster bisque, tilapia or something, and banana foster creme brulee. Phenomenal interior... Waitress was going to sit us in the bar area by the window... Ahh... NO. We want to sit in the majestic hall, thanks. And not directly beside a chatting couple, which is were we were re-assigned. When they finally got it right it was nice, and the pianist was great and really set the tone."}
{"text":"While the view of downtown Pittsburgh from the River Room at the Grand Concourse is wonderful, the service and food were less than spectacular.  There was a wedding reception taking place in the main dinning room, and the restaurant was quite busy.  We were seated at 7:40 pm for our 7:15 pm reservations.  The first wait staff arrived with water a few minutes after 8pm.  The service was friendly and pleasant, but very slow.  The best part of the meal was the bread.  Warm and delicious with excellent whipped butter.  However, that is were the excitement over the food ended.  Two people in our party ordered fish (one tilapia and one sole).  Both were average at best, with heavy breading and little flavor.  The filet was ordered medium rare and was served medium well.  The overall presentation and \"feeling\" of the food seems more appropriate for 1880 (when it was a functioning train station) than 2012.  Love the view and the interior space of this restaurant, but given the experience of the meal i would not be quick to return."}
{"text":"I have never written a review on Yelp, but after our visit to the Grand Concourse this past weekend, I felt compelled to do so. We have been there many times, for both brunch and dinner. We have never been disappointed (although the freshly prepared food at dinner is of course better than the brunch buffet).  We decided Friday night at the last minute to go out to dinner. Apparently the rest of Pittsburgh made the same call, because we couldn't get a table for our party of five anywhere decent without over an hour wait, which our three kids would not take well. So we surprised them and went 'to the city' and were seated immediately at the Grand Concourse in the riverfront room (per our request) with a beautiful view of the city skyline, the rivers, and the trains passing by (which entertained my boys).  We had raw oysters, and some kind of scallops with a creamy sauce as an appetizer, and my son had lobster bisque. They were all fantastic. My husband and I each had the snapper Milanese for dinner and my son ordered the potato encrusted tilapia.  Both were excellent. (The other two boys ordered from the children's menu.) We love Monterrey Bay Fish Grotto and Off the Hook, and the seafood at Grand Concourse could compete with both of them. My husband and son both agreed and we were just at Off the Hook last weekend (would have been there this night if they'd had tables available).  I just don't understand why the Grand Concourse is never packed when we go there (in a way I'm glad it's not so we can get seated!). Sure it may not have the 'trendy' factor of Meat and Potatoes or Grit, but the interior of the historic building (once a train station) is extremely unique and just amazingly beautiful.  The restaurant is classy without being stuffy. We have been there dressed up, but we've also been in jeans/khakis. The service is always good and the food is great. I highly recommend the Grand Concourse! Or if you just want a drink and an appetizer, pop into the Gandy Dancer (the pub connected to the restaurant). The place takes you back in time (in a good way!) - wish there were more restaurants in the burgh like it!"}
{"text":"I definitely like this place. I wasn't expecting such a classy dining experience and though I was wearing dress casuals, I felt a little under dressed. Our waiter (Greg I think) was very accommodating from start to finish. The drinks were great and the food was pretty good. I actually had my main dish sent back because it was inedible when it was brought out (probably because it sat too long while waiting for the rest of the table's order) but it was handled with no problem. The menu is a bit pricey, but it was a special occasion so it was worth it."}
{"text":"Ein echtes Erlebnisrestaurant im uralten Bahnhof von Pittsburgh am Station Square. Umgeben von Industriedenkmälern (Stahl !!!) und mit einem beeindruckenden Blick auf die Skyline von Pittsburgh. Seit meiner Zeit in Pittsburgh Ender der 80er ist das einer der liebsten Plätze zu dem ich Besucher einlade. Das Ambiente ist vibrierend und amerikanisch laut. Das Gebäude im luxuriösen Jugendstil lässt sehr gut erkennen, dass Eisenbahnfahren früher was Vornehmes war. Aber die Fotos an den Wänden zeigen auch sehr drastisch wie schmutzig eine Stahlstadt war. Blauer Himmel- Fehlanzeige.    Tolle Austernbar. Im Restaurant esse ich persönlich immer von der Seafood-Auswahl, am liebsten die \"Bouillabaisse mit Dungeness crab, scallops, mussels, shrimp & fish in a rich saffron broth; Add 1/2 live Maine lobster\" mit dem Lobster!! Aber auch clams, scallops und all die anderen Dinge sind gut. Unbedingt reservieren (online) und um einen Tisch \"at the windows of the glass house\" bitten. Das ist der in einen Wintergarten eingeglaste ehemalige Bahnsteig. Dort hat man den Blick auf die Skyline wie auf dem Foto. (Das Nachtfoto ist vom darüber liegenden Mount Washington). Parken ist in der Nähe in einem öffentlichen Parkhaus gut möglich."}
{"text":"A terrific Sunday brunch with made-to-order omelets, fresh fruit, baked goods, the infamous donuts, and all for a reasonable price. Service was very good, atmosphere terrific. The room overlooking the river is less dramatic, but marvelously quieter."}
{"text":"My sons graduation from Pitt.  Dinner at the (UN)grand Concourse.   Plans were made a month a head of time.  Reservations confirmed.  Special menu printed with my sons name on it.  2 choices in every course. Appetizers pre ordered.   16 guest Yes a 9:30 reservation but a month ahead of time.  Beautiful venue. Very elegant! A great waitress and one back up ( who was too busy herself)  Drinks ordered and that was the last thing of the night that went right.   Preordered appetizers slow in arriving.  Soup orders unable to be filled and ice cold when they did arrive.  Entrees arrived at various times and incorrectly too the point that 2 were so late that our guest just had them boxed to go home.  Deserts were wonderful as a midnight snack.   There was another graduation group that got up and left out of frustration.   Spoke with the manager and she did comp two entrees. A nice gesture but not enough to make up for the complete trashing of what was supposed to be a mile stone in my sons life. Especially since he had asked to go there.   We have a few more graduations and many more family events to celebrate but the will NOT be at the Grand Concourse.  We also have numerous business functions and out of town guest that stay at local hotels... yep you guessed it ...  will tell all of them what a beautiful building but don't eat there.    I give them a minus two stars."}
{"text":"This venue is gorgeous, the staff was very professional and the food was amazing!  This was my first experience there.  My husband & I liked it so much we purchased a membership for the Landry group of restaurants that they belong to.  We sat in the River Room (actually the seat pictured) and what a beatiful view of the city it had.  We will most definitely return to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Had brunch at the bar for Easter. Call days ahead for reservations.  This place is busy for brunch. We were visiting from put of town. Bloody Mary's are average. Our male bartender kinda sucked. They girl bartender there is awesome thou. Food was great. We will definitely comeback when we are in town"}
{"text":"This is the local restaurant in Station Square; all the rest are chains.  Everyone we met told us to be sure to go there; that the food was great.  We found it to be average.  My soup was served lukewarm and I sent it back, only to receive a second bowl of lukewarm soup.  The salad was Iceberg lettuce and a very lackluster dressing.  I was not offered a choice of dressings.  The cauliflower appetizer was quite good, and the rest of our group enjoyed the food.  Our server was new and we had to eat in the bar, due to the time of day.  Brunch is served on Sunday, in the main dining room until 4.  The greeter at the podium in the main dining room was kind of snooty.  The ladies room could have used some attention.  I guess you could say....I wouldn't hurry back."}
{"text":"Went for the brunch and will go back! Who could pass up that river and city view?! But of course, the food was delicious! Great variety and I thought the price was fair. We will definitely go back (once construction on the parkway is complete!) When we do, we'll opt to sit inside this time. The interior is absolutely gorgeous!"}
{"text":"Last time I went to the Grand Concourse for brunch, we didn't have a reservation. I felt like we were treated like second-class citizens for not making a reservation, so I was sure to make one this time.  We arrived 10 minutes early, and the hostess told us we would be seated right on time. We were not seated until 20 minutes after our reservation time. That wouldn't have been so bad if we hadn't been told we would be seated right away. There were at least 10 other groups with reservations also waiting, so the hostess could not reasonably have thought we would be seated on time.   That aside, they have a pretty impressive spread of food. Traditional breakfast, omelet bar, donut machine, ham, salmon, a table full of candy, and dessert, and more. There is also a nice view of the river and downtown.  Still, I think it's overpriced. The brunch buffet costs $25 per person, and add another $5 for valet.  For that kind of cost, the least they could do is seat you on time."}
{"text":"Went for a light lunch in the main dining room. I loved being surrounded by the beautiful and historical stained glass, but the meal wasn't as delightful. The butternut squash soup was attractive, topped with toasted pumpkin seeds, but the flavor was a bit bland and texture somewhat gritty. I've had better from the grocery store deli. My friend's clam chowder looked more promising; loaded with clams, but the flavor was mostly \"salt\". My salad course was limp and soggy with dressing. Was it made last night?  The fish and chips lunch was much better. Generous potions of white fish and French fries.  I would recommend coming only for a drink after eating somewhere else."}
{"text":"If you have never been to the Sunday Brunch, you have no idea what your missing.....Great Food, Incredible Service, and the atmosphere is wonderful.....Sure the 30 per person brunch maybe expensive....  But worth every penny"}
{"text":"Went there for late lunch as a pre-celebration with my family on June 13. Made reservations two weeks in advance for my large party. Long long wait for food. Waited over an hour for the food. Some food was cold. The side room we used was a bit warm. One order was wrong. Everyone was apologetic saying the kitchen got slammed. Politeness is no substitute for performance. The beauty of the facility did not match the quality of the service. They weren't ready for us or the people around us. Don't go here at an odd time."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch is FABULOUS!  My friends and I eat there before every 1pm Steelers game.  Service is unmatched.  Atmosphere is beyond incredible!"}
{"text":"Eating brunch here is like dating a really hot girl with only an okay personality.  The setting is beautiful, and the food is good, but just doesn't match the looks.  There are a few highlights, including the freshly made donuts (in the back by the bar).   The prime rib, lamb, and ham are also rather good.   Service, despite being buffet style, is very good.  In fact, we've had great waitstaff every visit.  The 3-star (mostly based on food) shouldn't be a deterrent. I still think it's a great place to bring out-of-towners for a special brunch."}
{"text":"What a neat place, built in 1901 a refinished grand train station and a live grand piano while you dine.  Food and service were fabulous and the only down side was the wine list, it was on the light side."}
{"text":"Based on numerous recommendations from others, we recently enjoyed the brunch at Grand Concourse. While I'd been to the restaurant before for lunch and dinner, I had never been for brunch. And while the lunches and the dinners are tasty...the brunch is fantastic!!  Highly recommended and worth it for special occasions. The atmosphere, live piano music, and numerous options will definitely make you happy. :-)  Note: While some think this is a dressy restaurant, the staff confirmed that brunch is casual, so don't feel pressured to wear a suit/dress unless you really want to!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed this evening with the service and the food.  My friend and I have been meeting here a couple times a year for years and the restaurant as really deteriorated My friend and I had reservations for 2 at 5:00 and they had difficulty finding a place to sit in a half-empty restaurant and we had to wait.  Once seated it was 20 minutes until we were approached by our server and provided a glass a water.  Greg stated that he didn't know he had a table.  I ordered the Caribbean Combo which is a crab cake and coconut macadamia nut crusted shrimp.  The crab cake was dry.  The shrimp were burnt.  I would have returned them to the kitchen but the server was no where in site."}
{"text":"***Sunday Brunch is their signature. Make sure to place a reservation two days in advance and request a premium spot with a view of the river***. Brunch variety is excellent. Needless to say that the ambience of this old train station is fantastic. Evening meals however, are quite unremarkable: inconsistent seasoning, and sometimes hot food is colder than they should be."}
{"text":"Beautiful building, but brunch was terrible. Cold eggs, cold sausage. Went at noon, and half of the chafing dishes were empty.  Please replenish at $28 pp!"}
{"text":"The grand building and lavish interior earns an extra star. We had Sunday brunch and mostly enjoyed the occasion. A great variety of options, friendly service (especially from the guy on the hot cake station) and generally good quality, although the shrimp lacked flavour.   Doughnuts and sweets were a great treat. But on the whole while everything was pretty good, we felt the food didn't quite match the grand environment."}
{"text":"Terrible service, we seated ourselves and had to wait 20 mins until someone brought the menus. The waiter didn't even give us time to read through at our own pace. Food came out 30 minutes later. Salad was OK. I ordered the Diablo pasta and my friend ordered the Veggie mushroom linguini. So bland, very oily and horrible taste. Would not come here again for dinner!"}
{"text":"Beautiful setting in the city's old train station in Station Square: stained glass everywhere, marble staircases, the works. It feels like a special occasion when you're there. We took my stepson there because he was going to college the next day. The menu focuses on seafood, but there are other options. The appetizers were terrific: scallops still on the shell, and coconut macadamia shrimp (also available as an entree). The main courses took awhile to arrive, but the manager came over to apologize because a large banquet was being held in a private dining room. The rest of the main dining room was not so crowded, though. When the food did come, though, it was good. My stepson had the steak, and it looked good and he said it was good, but he's 18, and always starving. It was a bit pricy, considering. I had the bouillabaisse, which was fine--the crab legs that were part of it were a little messy, but they brought me a \"towel service\"--a warm damp towel and a half lemon to clean up with, which did help. No towelettes in this establishment. Jane had the salmon, which she thought was okay, but I think we all agreed that the appetizers and the setting were the best part. The table service was fine, but we were kept waiting at the hostess station when we arrived, even though, as I said, the restaurant was not crowded. Still, it was a nice place."}
{"text":"After having a lovely meal two years ago at the grand concourse, we were very excited to return to this location. Unfortunately our expectation had nothing to do with the reality of a very poor meal.  The service was slow to the point of neglect. Drinks were never refilled after the initial serving. With a party of six, three of the meals we're delivered cold after a 25 minute wait. Having to send them back it took another 25 minutes to get the replacement meals which were missing the sauces, etc..  It took a manager to get the sauces for the meals. At this point half of our party had eaten, and the other half was ready to leave.  We had to box our own meals, and forget about being asked if we would like a cup of coffee to cap the meal... That was not in the stars.   Needless to say, we will not be back."}
{"text":"Great historic atmosphere and the food and service were exceptional. Try to eat in the historic main dining room if you can."}
{"text":"We love the Grand Concourse. It's the restaurant we choose when we have a celebration, a special family get-together, or night out. They specialize in seafood, though everything we've had there (filet mignon, prime rib, chicken, tuna, scallops, etc) has been outstanding.  The smoked salmon spread (and occasionally smoked bluefish pate) that comes with the hot bread is smokey tastiness, and I don't normally even like salmon. My favorite that I get every time is the coconut-crusted shrimp - I highly recommend them!  My sister has ordered a couple of their entrees gluten-free, too, and they've been good about that.  We actually had our rehearsal dinner here in 2008 as well, and it was perfect, from planning (via phone and email since we were in California during the planning) through the entire event.  We love the atmosphere - the amazing restoration brings the gorgeous train station back to its original glory and beauty. We've been seated near the live pianist a few times, and he'll play songs you request. We've sat near the river and in the large dining room. There isn't a bad table in the place."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre for the price.  Our waitress was very good at her job,  but her attitude was poor. She was rude to other staff members and complained about long hours and her low pay to customers (our 2 person bill, 20% was $20).   Also disappointing for us was they had a wedding rental during the time of our reservations. This pushed us to the outter edge of the restaurant and we didn't get to view or experience the main dining hall.  We did still get a great view of the river.   The prime rib was average.  Vegetables are not included with the meal.  The crab cake was not packed with flavor,  but it had tons of large pieces of crab meat and the red pepper sauce with it was delicious.   It was our anniversary diner and the menus said happy anniversary,  pretty cool.  Overall a 3 star experience for us.  Our experience it wasn't worth the $$$ bill."}
{"text":"Visited the other day after recommendation on our Ducky Tour, Tuesday early afternoon I think. There was a bit of a wait for the \"fancier\" room with a view of the river, but none at the seat yourself bar restaurant. The blonde somewhat older bartender took my order, which was surprising and I assumed they were short staffed with servers or something forcing her to do so. Her quickness & friendliness was surprising for our orders and something so appreciated from a former bartender who knows the headaches she deals with. In addition a younger brown haired girl with freckles & glasses would make sure to check in with us every once in awhile too. She refilled drinks efficiently without being asked, and even offered us some advice on what else to do while back in Pgh for a week. I also heard her ask more than a few times if there was anything she could do to help the bartender out, while running dishes and such. Even while seated with tables clearly her own, she didn't neglect those who weren't hers. It's odd to find bartenders and servers that truly care about more than the tip they're getting - and these 2 made a GREAT team. I was surprised when finding out in conversation that the younger girl was new there. I would've never been able to tell, a nice compliment for the hiring process this place must go through to get the best. Upon leaving both the bar tender and main hostess wished us a good afternoon, which was gratifying along with a door being held open by the younger girl. We are coming back tomorrow for dinner with reservations for the view thanks to the great service and food! Expecting just the same and looking forward to it."}
{"text":"My husband and I had our small wedding reception here in the board room. We live in Seattle, but getting things planned out was easy. Brian and Dawn answered all emails promptly and I was able to come in and see the room to get \"a vision\" the week before the wedding. Brian and his staff did an amazing job setting up the room for us: the cake/cookie table was set up beautifully and the flower arrangement on the tables were all set to go. The wait staff was extra polite and made sure they did everything they could to make the night go smoothly (they even saved us some of our appetizers that we missed during our photos)! I'd highly recommend the Grand Concourse for any family gathering. We already can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This is one of the classiest restaurants I have been to in Pittsburg!  It is beautiful, with its old main room that has huge ceilings and beautiful architecture.  It is a sought after place to dine.  It used to be an old train station and it shows on the inside with its grand old beauty.  The food is AMAZING! I had the filet mignon and it was prepared beautifully.  It was a special too.  I got a salad, a filet mignon (petite) and a gorgeous cheesecake that had\" VERY ARTISTICALLY TALENTED CHEF\" written all over it with its beautiful plated design.  I love this place and would def. recommend you go there when visiting Pittsburg.   It is BEAUTIFUL!!"}
{"text":"Grand Concourse is hands down THE place to take a date, out of town guests, or prospective in-laws (unless they really don't like fish). Even after several decades I'm still always impressed by the interior, with one of the most amazing displays of stained glass spanning a large barrel vault in this converted train station from the gilded age. What's really surprising however is how good the food is. Pittsburgh is blessed with a number of great seafood restaurants and Grand Concourse is certainly one of best. Easily a whole star better than McCormick and Schmick's, and more moderately priced. If instead you take the incline up for dinner on Mount Washington, you'll spend several hundred dollars more for a far less wonderful meal. Once upon a time, their bar, The Gandy Dancer, was the place to go for wonderful plates of linguini and clam sauce and a live pianist. Unfortunately the bar is not what it used to be, but the main restaurant is."}
{"text":"I loved the decor of this restaurant since itself is a historical building. The food was not bad but I would say the biggest selling point of this place is the ambiance. I had the oysters, calamari, and blue crab and they were pretty good. They have good wine selections as well."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing Sunday brunch. I loved the donut machine, the meat lovers omelet, and the waffle! I also enjoyed the shrimp, Mac n cheese, and fruit (yup, you're going to want to come hungry!) The service is great (who knew you could have such good service at a buffet?!), and the building is striking. Highly recommended, especially if you're a tourist."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere. The majestic 100+ year old train station is impressive. We sat next to the windows with a great view of the city. Occasionally a train would go by adding to the experience.   The service was prompt and courteous.  The lobster bisque and crab cakes were delicious. The calamari was great. It was cooked with peppers and a sauce that had a little spice and a little sweetness. Hard to describe. You have to try it. The best calamari I've ever had. I also loved the garlicky rolls. Great experience."}
{"text":"This review is for dinner.  The restaurant is beautiful, probably one of the best in Pittsburgh. The stained glass alone is worth the trip. We had a large group and we were seated next to the pianist. We enjoyed the live music (although for some might have thought it was too loud- we didn't). The oysters on the half shell were fresh and the mussels were done perfectly, the calamari was so-so. The lobster bisque was delightful.  My wife and I had diver scallops over polenta that was well prepared and delicious. I heard no complaints from the group.  The cocktails were just so-so, almost like the person making them was reading a recipe for the first time. The service was good, not great. They were not very crowded for a Saturday evening."}
{"text":"Good Sunday brunch. We had reservations, which I recommend. Had to wait a little in the buffet lines but nothing crazy. Nice view of the city in the riverside dining room."}
{"text":"We took our son there for his 21st birthday and had a small group of seven. Definitely a nice place for special occasions! Upscale with service to match and amazing atmosphere and view of the river and Pittsburgh skyline. Food was excellent across the board except for one side that was extremely salty -- server never hesitated and was prompt to address the issue to our satisfaction."}
{"text":"came here for sunday brunch buffet on July 2009.  i was very pleased with the buffet selection.  there were lots of variety for you to pick from.  there are a few stations that serve made-to-order omelets and desserts.  i've been looking for dessert buffets for a longgggg time!  so it was almost a dream come true.  although they didn't refill new dessert items towards end of the brunch hours ... almost everything was delicious, even the juice tasted fresh.  i like the \"historic\" feel of the place.  there are lots to see and think about while you're there.  even the bathroom was very interesting."}
{"text":"The Grand Concourse is visually grand: tall marble columns, shiny brass railings, big beautiful windows. It's in an old railway station and it gives you a sense of Gilded Age elegance. A great place for Sunday brunch, especially if you've got out-of-town visitors. The food at brunch is good, especially at the manned stations like the carving board. Buffet items were warm but some - scrambled eggs, salmon- just weren't tasty.  Service was very good although staff was busy. I'd give G.C. 4 1/2 if I could."}
{"text":"I don't know about anyone else, but when I go to a restaurant I am grading them almost wholly on the merits of their food. This is in contrast to the plethora of reviews for this place and others where half of the review is spent talking about the architecture of the building etc. Hey, that's nice and all, but I came to eat - so what about the food and service?!?! Especially at the price point here. There in lies the problem with this place.   Full-disclosure - I didn't choose this place it was for a birthday dinner. Also, due to the circumstances of that, I did not pay. Very thankful for that!  First it's in station square, so you are gonna be shelling out money before you even get inside just for the privilege of parking your car and wading your way through the drunken college population. Yes, they have free valet if you are there for less than 2 hours as I understand it, but as you will see in my review....good luck with sticking to that time line.   Reservations were for 7. What time did we get drinks? About 8. Yes. An hour just for drinks. Strike one.  After appetizers came the salads. The problem here was I was clearly still finishing the appetizer on my plate when the waitress insisted on shoving the salad in front of me where there was clearly no room. Leaving her just holding it in the air hovering around my head. I guess I'm suppose to grab it from you and find room myself?! I didn't know what else to do at this awkward moment so that is what I did. This resulted in me clumsily knocking my fork on the table. Thankfully the napkin was strategically placed and I was spared any further disappointment. How about wait until there is room next time? Strike two.   Finally came the entrees. Ordered the salmon rockefeller. Which is described as being 'stuffed'. I'm not sure how you would stuff salmon and therefore the spinach, bacon, and sauce were simply piled on top. There was no mention of how it was prepared on the menu but it was apparently fried in some way. Along with that came 2 things not mentioned on the menu at all - a pyramid of white rice and two(2) asparagus spears. Yes, two. Really? I think for $28 I can get at least 3 spears right?! It kind of felt like when you get a .10 raise at the supermarket as a teenager. Just keep them next time, I think that would have come off better. It was fine and all, but the portion was on the small side. Though a quick glance around the table at least showed that this is a consistent practice. Fit for women and small children perhaps but that's about it. Strike 3.  Atmosphere. Not comfortable for me. Too loud to have conversation without screaming or leaning very close to who you are sitting with. Strike 4.   In short - if you like going somewhere and paying for awful service, small portions, and food priced at almost double what you can get at any number of other establishments at the same or better quality and taste go for it.   P.S. Yes, the building is beautiful."}
{"text":"The selection was good.  From the hot buffet to the salads and carving stations, there appeared to be just about something for everyone. The twin omnivores dined on pasta, salads, and grazed freely at the carving stations. My lovely wife (the reason for our dinner) was pleasantly sated at the seafood selection.  Our server Herbert (w/his quaint accent) was fantastic. He appeared to anticipate our needs AND was very kid friendly. This is not my family's. First time here and it will not be the last. If you find yourself at the grand concourse for dinner, ask for Herbert's section. You won't be disappointed!! Grand Concourse, I will see you again soon!"}
{"text":"What an absolutely beautiful building, the interior of which will take your breath away!  We had reservations for Valentine's Day.  Valet parking, coat service.  We arrived a few minutes early so we had a drink at the bar.  We were promptly seated.    We ordered the Brie with apple chutney as an appetizer.  We also shared a bottle of Cabernet that they often serve as one of their house wines.  Both were delish.    I had one of the specials, a tenderloin and crab cake with mashed potatoes and asperagus.  My boyfriend had the crab and spinach stuffed salmon.  We were both very pleased with our meals.    For dessert we shared the key lime pie (fabulous) and coffees.    Our waitress and the staff were very kind and responsive.  Service was very quick, especially for such a busy evening.  We were happy and will be coming back again."}
{"text":"We finally tried the talked about Brunch at the Grand Concourse. Going in with high expectations, we left very underwhelmed. Not only are the food stations scattered around the dining room, but the food options themselves are lacking.   The 'hot station' has what I would call your typical breakfast buffet (eggs, bacon, sausage, etc.). There's a carving station with prime-rib, ham and turkey - the high point of the meal.  Salad option were mushy, and the Bananas Foster was a quickly thrown together imitation, though the donut station was unique.  My made-to-order Bloody Mary was good, though.  3 cocktails and two brunches for $75 -- I was expecting much, much more."}
{"text":"I know the Grand Concourse is a beautiful, rustic location, but I think their food and service is on the decline.  My wife and I chose this restaurant for our 47th wedding anniversary and were very disappointed.  The appetizers were fine especially the lobster bisque.  However, our entries were horrible.  My wife's lobster tail was over cooked and very dry.  My live lobster, which was poorly shelled by our server, was very over cooked, very dry and totally inedible.  I complained to management and my meal was deducted from the bill.  Our anniversary was still quite expensive and I didn't even have an entire.  Our \"Grand\" dinner turned into a huge disappointment!"}
{"text":"Food is decent for a brunch buffet and the interior decor is beautiful. The outdoor seating is exceptional. The flow if the restaurant is above average for buffet style. Price is fairly high (as most buffets are), so we like to save this for when family and friends are in town, or as a treat (when we are in the mood to eat a lot of food).  Visit soon!"}
{"text":"The setting is very rustic and has a great view of downtown and the river. Even though they did not seem especially crowded for Fathers Day it took a while for the host to confirm my reservation and to seat my party. Frustration continued when we did not receive anything remotely classified as quick service. When we finally got a server the delay was explained as an error in assignment. Well enough about that. The chowder and house salad was good. The entrees -salmon, snapper and clams - were well prepared and complimented with rice. The total meal was excellent."}
{"text":"Ouch. In laws brought the family here for Christmas dinner. We were a party of 7 with reservations-- honestly how many \"walk-ins\" would there be on Christmas night?  We were from out of town and I think they anticipated a great dinner, unfortunately we were all disappointed. From appetizers to dessert the staff seemed completely unprepared.  Menu was clearly abbreviated and included a prix fixe selection. Oysters on the half shell were poorly shucked, 2 were dehydrated and 3 were not loosened from their shells. Bread came after apps but no bread plates were supplied.  Martha's Vineyard Salad sounded great but was pathetic: black tipped and slimed red leaf lettuce, untoasted pine nuts, someone waved a bit of blue cheese over the salad(looked like an accident as opposed to an ingredient\". Really not good. Caesar salad a little better, romaine was green. Fish chowder was so thick it resembled a bowl of pudding, holding the shape of the bowl as my granddaughter ate it.  Entrees were clearly hurried, as none of the steaks were cooked to their requested temperatures--everything rather rare. The prix fixe dishes all lacked the advertised Bernaise sauce, and included 2 whole spears of asparagus. Although the spears were lovingly pared, it seemed the Grinch was on plating duty.  However there was some styrofoam included in the quinoa pilaf, which earned us one free dessert. Desserts were the best looking plates served. But even those did not save this rather bad meal.  Service was interminable, and shoddy. In his haste to be rid of us, the waiter didn't even offer us coffee. Although I must confess the party was happy to leave.  Such a disappointment, I cannot imagine any manager, kitchen or dining room, accepting this performance. What a waste of such a beautiful facility."}
{"text":"A good choice for a special occasion. The food is always good here but I just can't quite give it 5 stars because I expect more when I am paying more. The inside is quite nice decor wise."}
{"text":"My family took me here for Father's Day a few years back. It was marvelous. The buffet was so very good. The donut machine was delicious. I made about 10. The pianist was a good player. 5 stars for you, Grand Concourse"}
{"text":"As a visitor to Pittsburgh, I saw several restaurant suggestion, but none of it has Grand Concourse. We found it accidentally but we love it more than any other restaurant in Pittsburgh. We had brunch there. It was decorated differently with others, the food is nice and fresh, the price is reasonable. Love it"}
{"text":"Food is very good as always from the crispy duck to the blue point oysters to the salmon rockefeller and mahi mahi as well as the steaks. Really, it's good, don't hesitate to go. However, we went on a Saturday and had reservations at 8:00 PM. We arrived at 8PM and waited a good 15 minutes until they cleared a table. C'mon folks, if I'm dropping $250 on a meal for three people at this place, I expect my table to be ready when I arrive. Otherwise, tell me to come at 8:30. The hostess table was full of young girls who weren't that engaging. \"How are you tonight?\" was met with \"We're clearing your table now.\" We were seated at a table by the water with a fantastic view of the city, but we soon realized that the light above our table was not lit. We were promptly moved to a nearby table after the manager explained of an electric problem. Out waitress was engaging. Clearly they were busy that night. A glass was broken behind me. A busboy dropped some sauces on the floor next to us. We looked around and realized there is no dress code in this place. Although we were dressed appropriately and others had sports coats, others came with jeans and tattoos exposed. Call me old-fashioned (I'm 42), but when I'm spending that kind of money on a nice dinner, I don't want to look at tattoos, which includes a waitress walking by. The food is pricey, but not outrageous or unexpected. Yes, I will go back. This is a great restaurant overall and you won't be disappointed. It's also a very good place to take a new date."}
{"text":"This is an amazing setting. A converted railroad station for the P&LE going back to the 1870's. The decorum is just beautiful in this enormous structure. Dark woods and earth toned stained glass windows. Google pictures if you really want to get a good idea. I sat at a table right next to the big picture window that extends from one end of the restaurant to the other, giving a spectacular view of the river and the city beyond. A truly beautiful setting as the sun goes down and the deep blues of night fill in the sky beyond the buildings. The service is top of the line. We had a terrific waiter. Upon his suggestion, I had the Martha's Vineyard Salad which was fantastic. And for my main entree' I had the King Cove Sole which was parmesan encrusted and sauteed to perfection, topped with jumbo lump crab. Couldn't have been happier with my selection and the setting was absolutely fantastic. Don't miss experiencing this place should you find yourself in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Visited Pittsburgh for my mother's 60th birthday this year the weekend of March 1st. This restaurant came highly recommended but we were treated horribly!!! We arrived at the restaurant and my reservation was not recognized which was weird until I showed confirmation on my phone.  We were then seated in \"servant\" area near the kitchen. Our waiter never introduced himself... Just plain out rude!!!  Really wanted my Mom to enjoy herself for her 60th bday but sorry Mom.... we had to leave!  Left message on Yelp hoping I can stop people from experiencing what I did. 6 months ago,  Katie, their Business Customer Service person decided she wants to message me on Yelp but never followed back up with me.  I emailed her back about a month ago to make her aware. She emailed me back a few days ago stating that she gonna look into this..  ha ha ha that was funny!!!\" Guess what??? Katie has yet to follow up.  If your job is to see that the every customer has a enjoyable experience or at least try to accommodate them with such...  Then why isn't Katie doing her job???? Horrible customer service for such a nice look restaurant.  Will NEVER visit and I hope u don't either! #didntevenwanttoratewith1star !!!"}
{"text":"I've been here now a few times with my girlfriend and her family to celebrate special occasions and we've been seated both on the waterfront and inside the main hall.  Eating inside such a large, beautiful train terminal is truly a sight to behold which lends great ambiance to your meal and a great feeling of elegance.  The food I've had has all been tasty as well, with extra points going towards the lobster bisque which was great and surprisingly filling.  The multiple seafood dishes I've eaten here have all tasted fresh and been prepared well, and the dessert is a decadent way to end the evening if you can manage to have enough room left over after the generous dinner portions to eat any.  The only minor critique I have is that a side dish was once served cold to a member of my party, but when informed the waiter apologized profusely and offered to bring him another."}
{"text":"We recently had our wedding at the Grand Concourse, and we couldn't have asked for a better venue. There were two managers helping us plan everything and answering all of our questions for months before the wedding.Thank you Brian and Dawn!  We consistently hear that it is the best wedding that our family/friends have been to, and it doesn't seem like they are just embellishing for our benefit. The venue is obviously beautiful, and the food was the best I've had at a wedding. The service was superb as well. Susan and Colin (lead servers) took amazing care of us. We never had to wait for anything we needed, and all of our guests were taken care of as well.  There were some cool and unique touches too. The bar can be placed in a separate room, which really helped cut down on the noise so that people could talk easily during dinner. Getting married on the middle platform of the beautiful stairwell made you feel like you were on a pedestal, which was really cool. We also got the donut machine that they offer, and it was a much bigger hit than we expected!  We definitely recommend the Grand Concourse for anyone having a wedding in the Pittsburgh area."}
{"text":"I took my girlfriend there for our anniversary on a Friday night. We got all dressed up and made reservations for 8pm but when I arrived we clearly didn't need reservations. It was kind of empty and I was kinda disappointed when the hostess took us all the way to the back of the restaurant not seating us in the main dining room because the old school architecture was a marvel to look at. It use to be an old train station I believe? But since it was late at night the whole river and city were light up so our seat was very romantic. Our waiter, his name was Greg I believe was truly amazing and knowledgeable. They gave us special menues that had happy anniversary printed on them and told us we could keep the menu's which just added to the fun of the experience.   We started out with a few cocktails, memory escapes me what we tried but they were all very good and ordered fresh oysters on the half shell, bruschetta montrachet, and almond encrusted brie. Oh my goodness everything was quite amazing and tasty. My girl friend was already full by the time the main course came which didn't stop me from taking a few bites of her dish of shrimp fresca and my dish of tilapia provencale. Both were very filling and well served. Greg was an exceptional waiter. He had our drinks filled before we even needed to ask and checked on us often to make sure everything was cooked perfectly. He even told us a funny anniversary story about his parents that made us laugh and feel welcomed.   We got a rich chocolate dessert to split after as well. All the while a piano player in the background played top 40 songs on his keys as it became fun trying guess and sing along to the songs he was playing.   Our experience was fantastic even though the bill was kind of expensive but hell it was totally worth it in my opinion. It honestly felt like we were kings and queens by the amount of good food we ate and the treatment our server gave us. I would definitely go back there for a special occasion and recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"The Grand Grand Concourse. I just love being in this space. We were seated for a late lunch with an amazing view of the city.  I'm not a fish eater so don't judge the food here on my review. I had the chopped spinach salad, calamari and most of my Dad's french fries. The salad has a bacon vinaigrette, which was good but a little heavy for my taste. My Dad's fries were great.  The service from Jason was great. What a sweet guy. Can't figure out why he left SF for Pittsburgh, but glad that he was there to serve us.  I hope to visit the Grand Concourse on all of my future visits to Pittsburgh. I can't imagine a better place to sip tea and watch the day pass by in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"THE LAST TIME I WAS THERE - THEY RAN OUT OF FOOD!  Now granted it happened to be the night of the University of Pittsburgh's Graduation which happened to coincide with my wedding anniversary but really it was crazy! My special occasion was just as important as everyone else! However, the main course I desired was unavailable so I settled for a second choice that ended up tasting like something from Long John Silver! Greasy over cooked shrimp! I'm over giving this place big praise. Yes the view is nice but it really does take one bad visit to change someones mind. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I have been in Pittsburgh for 5 years, and waited for the right day and right occasion to surprise a special someone for an elegant Sunday Brunch. I called few days prior to the visit and conveniently reserved table for two window facing for the breath taking view. They do not guarantee seating, but we reached 15 mins before 10am, and were able to get what we requested once the doors opened. Our server Nicholas was an absolute gentleman, I ordered the Fruit blast Moscato which was so good. There is ample variety to choose from, but I highly recommend the Omelette! There is no way you won't over eat! Don't miss out!!"}
{"text":"If I was just rating the magnificent space I would give The Grand Course more than 5 stars, but unfortunately this rating is for the food and I am compelled to not give the restaurant anymore than 2 stars.  What a shame that the most beautiful room in Pittsburgh does not have food that is on par with the stunning architecture.  Do I recommend going there?  Absolutely yes, for drinks or desert to sit in the grandeur of the main room, but not for a full meal.  I have eaten Brunch, Lunch and Dinner twice here in the past month and the food is consistently mediocre and greasy.  Yesterday I went for brunch at 1pm.  The food was horribly picked over and not replenished, most of the food was just the remains of what had been sitting out for too long.  They did eventually replenish the food, but after we had all eaten.  They shouldn't wait until every last drop has been eaten, it should be a constant process of making the food look presentable.  Most of the cooked foods were too greasy and overcooked.  The Omelette bar was instead a big griddle where the cook was pouring out long strips of egg enough for 10 omelets or so.  Then he'd put your toppings onto a section and would cut it off for you.  Because the omelets were not individually made to order in separate frying pans, by the time you got your omelette the cheese wasn't melted, the toppings weren't cooked and it was like rubber, I took one bite and that was that.    I took a friend here for her birthday and was truly embarrassed by the whole experience.  My friend's son is a chef at a famous restaurant in a large city.  I kept feeling like I had to apologize for how awful the food was.  Why is this not on par with a classic Ritz Carlton or Four Seasons brunch experience?  Instead it feels like a brunch that's a bit better than a college cafeteria.  Most of the main food is cramped into a small side area with deserts being spread out to the other side of the room.  They should create a larger dedicated space for brunch where everyone is not cramped like sardines into such a small unimpressive area.  I know they have a private room adjacent to the main room, this would work perfectly, but of course then it would be much more obvious how few choices there really are.  The best thing about desert was the homemade donut making machine.  If you wait you can watch your donut being made from start to finish, brilliant!  The English Trifle was awful.  It would be better to not serve something that is such a traditional dish if you don't at least look at a recipe for how to make one.  I have had trifles all over the world and this takes the cake for the worst one ever.  I wish that I could say this place was fantastic all around, but it is not.  The room is already fantastic.  It's time to take charge and get the food up to par."}
{"text":"Went here for Valentine's Day dinner.  Train Station turned into a restaurant that overlooks the city skyline. Gorgeous views and ambiance.  Cocktails were excellent. Mango mojito and sangria were delicious.   We had the sea bass and snapper. All perfectly cooked. Flavorful and a killer Parmesan risotto as a side.  Service was exceptional. The prices are a bit steep, but it is a great place for a special dinner where the price matched up with quality.  Only negative, the Lobster bisque was just okay."}
{"text":"nice mussels.  nice old feel.  i took my  gf here, and we enjoyed ourselves immensely."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in a restored train station from the glory days of rail. The building is impressive, and that's worth one of the stars I give the place. The other zero stars I give are for the food (mediocre for the price) and the service (non existent).  We arrived on time for an 8:15 reservation, but weren't seated until 8:30. We then sat for 15 minutes at our empty table until the waiter finally arrived to take our drink orders. When he brought the drinks, we put in orders for appetizers and entrees. Another 30 minutes passed before the appetizers arrived. Yes, we sat at the table for 45 minutes before the first food showed up. No...that's not entirely correct. With the drinks, he brought us a couple of packets of saltine crackers and a jar of Tabasco. Why the Tabasco? I have no idea. Perhaps we were meant to barter with the other tables for dinner rolls.   So, the appetizers arrive. In an apparent attempt to make up for the late appetizers, he brought the entrees just five minutes later. We hadn't finished the appetizers and here he was trying to take them away again to make room on the small table for the entrees and the inexplicable bottle of Tabasco.  The food was good but luke warm. It certainly didn't justify the hefty price tag. I don't mind mediocre cheap food, and I don't mind excellent expensive food. Mediocre expensive food is unacceptable. We didn't try the dessert. Frankly, I couldn't risk waiting another hour for it to arrive.   If you find yourself at Station Square in Pittsburgh, wander in to the Grand Concourse and take a look at the exquisite architecture. Then walk across the street to the fondue shop and eat there."}
{"text":"The Grand Concourse is a Pittsburgh legend. Formerly a train station, this beautiful, stain glass-filled restaurant is among the most beautiful in the city. It sits among the river, providing a great ambiance.   The wait staff is extremely knowledgeable and professional and the food is generally quite good. I recently got a filet that was as smooth as butter. It was spectacular! The potatoes were more like a weird potato pancake kind of thing. I would have preferred a regular baked potato or mashed potato. I would also say that the glasses of wine are pretty small for the price. I found myself drinking a sip and thinking, \"That was about $3.\"   This is a place where kids do pop up, but for the high prices, I'm not sure why. Parents would be better off taking their kids elsewhere.   This is a great place for a special occasion, if you have at least $100 to spend."}
{"text":"The staff accommodated this family who had the audacity to show up to Pittsburgh's best brunch with no resi's. (My family) Let us sit on the empty gated patio so our terrorist toddler could run amuck and not bother other patrons. Glad I put some dry shampoo in.   food= totally great. Service also super."}
{"text":"We gave it another shot but sadly disappointing again! I had been to Grand Concourse for brunch in November and loved it. The food was great and it is a beautiful place to eat. Unfortunately, the second time around was not very good. We ate dinner there Friday night(you can read that in my preious review) and had a terrible expereince, food was less than average but we were hoping it was an off night and came back for brunch on Sunday. It was so disappointing! Everything was cold and tasteless, and every where you looked it was mayhem! They really need to fix the setup they have for brunch. Bagels were hard and over toasted, lox was good,  however, the whole smoked salmon they had out was also over cooked and could not be eaten. Everything was the same, all the entrees they had out were cold and tasteless. Everything on the hot bar was cold, eggs, sausage, etc. The dessert couldn't even save it. They used to have great cinammon rolls..now they are hard and tasteless. Such a dissapointment for such a beautiful place. I don't know if they have changed chef's or food suppliers but the food has really gone down hill."}
{"text":"Came here tonight for an anniversary dinner. Beautiful railroad station with high stained glass ceilings and a wealth of history, including owners who disappeared at sea. We were seated about 10 minutes after our reservation time (15-20 minutes after checking in) in a side area with a great view of the city at night. It was extremely loud and poorly lit--out table candle went missing. After another 10 minutes, our server approached with promise of water after her return. Another 10 minutes and she was back, taking our drink orders. After, she tells us that the food is taking an extremely long time, but was now better since the dinner rush was over. We were fine with that and and awaited our beverages and water. It was 10 minutes more for water to arrive, and we placed our orders with a promise of rolls. About 15-20 minutes later our wine and beer arrived. No rolls. Another 20 minutes passed and the bread finally came, as did our appetizer (calamari). The calamari was drowned out by the cornmeal coating, but the rolls were hot and buttery. We noticed others were also grumbling about the waits as well. It took about 20 minutes for a water refill, and our food finally arrived about 1.5 hours+ into our dinner. My husband's prime rib was raw and had to be returned. His parmesan risotto, decorated with alfalfa, was cold and gummy. My plate was extremely hot, but my food lukewarm. The crabcakes were lumpmeat with little filler, and the mustard with an overwhelming horseradish taste. The drunken vegetables that accompanied my bland macadamia & coconut crusted shrimp were a misnomer. There was a hint of curry coating sliced bananas and colorful peppers. That was it. The shrimp were topped with two pieces of spicy diced mango, and really nothing else to lend flavor to them. They were basic and a disappointment. And, finally the sweet potato mash was uneventful, and a stark contrast on that plate. Two hours later, we asked for the check, as I didn't think dessert was worth it. The table next to us left before receiving their long-awaited meals. We plotted dessert at The Melting Pot. I'm not keen to revisit this once-cherished spot in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I went there on Sunday, Father's Day of all days! They were booked for reservations but did have an area of the restaurant called the saloon were you could just get a table. The weight was about 10 minutes, not bad! The concourse is an amazing place to awe if you love architecture. The food was buffet style all you can eat, only on Sundays. It wasn't bad, just wished they had more warm plate options though, and limit the desert options."}
{"text":"I LOVE the Grand Concourse!  I've been eating here since I was a kid and it never gets old!  Every time there is a certain occasion or if I just want a nice dinner out, it's hard to not choose the Grand Concourse! First of all, the food is AMAZING!  The seafood is definitely some of the best in the city.  In my 23 years of going there, I don't think I've ever had anything I didn't like!  Probably my favorite time to go is for the Sunday brunch.  There is literally everything imaginable and everything is delicious.  You definitely need to plan on relaxing for the rest of the day though because you will be full!! They have great deals if you go for the Early Bird menu too which usually includes a drink, appetizer, main course, and dessert for once price as opposed to the usual a la carte dinner menu. For a fancy restaurant, the place is really kid-friendly too.  My parents used to bring me and my 4 siblings were all the time when we were younger and we all had our favorite kid's menu selection! My family loves this place so much that we even get take-out items, such as the salmon pate (probably one of my most favorite things at the Grand Concourse), for parties at home. On top of the wonderful food, the ambiance is also amazing.  How can you beat the beauty of this old train station from the early 1900's?  Also, the view of Pittsburgh from the side room is amazing too!  I love being right on the river and watching the people and boats go by.   Overall, I would highly recommend the Grand Concourse!  It's definitely one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh!!"}
{"text":"5 stars for atmosphere, 1 star for food. The food was just uninspired and not well cooked. I had a great drink but all in all I would have preferred to just sit and enjoy the sights with some wine than eat anything."}
{"text":"The main thing is the atmosphere...it's a lovely old building I think it used to be part of the train station? The interiors are lovely. They left a lot of it the same the ceilings are high and just wonderful...I wish I had been seated in this area rather than the weird loud area that I was seated in.   The food is good  and the people are just nice enough...like if they tried they would be sooner dooper nice.   Our server was at first a little cold and standoffish but as the evening progressed she seemed to warm up to us...shouldn't it be the other way around? The hostess was the same way...weird at first then she became nice...  The menu was quite nice with a lot of yummy looking choices!  The food was good my friend ordered the Bouillabaisse and by the looks of it,it looked delicious. I ordered lobster bisque soup while it tasted great the texture was way too thick like a cream of wheat texture-My fish was so so I believe I had Chilean bass it's not the best I've ever had but was edible and I liked the sides better than the actual meal.   The noise level was horrible...there was a large group next to us I think they rented out a part of the restaurant the only issue was that it was not like a separate room...they just partitioned part of the space off with a table cloth (uhm I have and idea either rent out that entire space or rent out a room)...it was annoying they were making speeches and clapping it didn't add to my enjoyment of my dinner when I could barely hear what the person across the table from me was saying.    Over all a nice place but I may asked to be seated somewhere else next time (yes if I'm in the area I would come back). Maybe I'll have a better overall experience next time.   FYI: The nicest part of this restaurant was the valet guys...yes you heard me right not the food or the in restaurant service....but the valets were the nicest most normal group of people ever."}
{"text":"Everything we had was simply awesome including their special wine.This restaurant sits on a beautiful location so try to get a river side seat. We ordered mussels, shrimps , a special almond crusted crostini and salmon. Everything was delicious. Our waitress was also very sweet. That was an additional bonus which you can rarely find in NY."}
{"text":"I had a tear in why eye as I watched their donut conveyor fry a donut and crank it out to the bowl. Fresh friggin donuts!   I just got to town and my driver recommended me to come here for brunch. I skipped sleep (I took a red eye) and grubbed away.   Food: Brunch had amazing options, though it was pretty pricey...so one should expect the food to be good. They had an assortment of meats, veges, american comfort items and an omelette station.   Service:  Great server and friendly staff overall.   Environment:  This building is very grand. A must see. If you're not going to eat in here at least just walk in and take a stroll!  Price:  $30 after tax and tip is pretty pricey for a brunch.   Food: 5 Service: 5 Environment: 5 Price: 3"}
{"text":"For me, it was the building and its location. The food ... well, it was enjoyable but not memorable. We were seated in the River Room at 5 pm and enjoyed an evening of river boats/barges with the downtown skyline as a background. But the building is fabulous! It made me forget the average grilled swordfish I was served and the polite but slovenly waiter. I will pay their higher prices just to be in that beautiful building again!"}
{"text":"I really loved this place! We came for brunch and everything was delicious! The cinnamon rolls were really good, salmon, waffles, omelet... you have many things to choose from the buffet, it is a really big one! Don't miss this place for a Sunday brunch and then a nice walk through Mount Washington view! :)"}
{"text":"We had the dynamite oysters for a starter per the recommendation of our server, and they were pretty good.  I had the Jerk Mahi-Mahi and Shrimp, and actually thought the shrimp was a bit better in terms of the taste profile.  I think the seasonings went better with the shrimp, but the mahi-mahi still tasted great.  I preferred the Monterey Bay Fish Grotto over this place, as I'm a huge seafood fan, but I still enjoyed the meal!"}
{"text":"We were here for my boyfriend's work Christmas party last night and I have to rave about the food.  The food potions for the evening were crab cakes and a filet. The filet melted in your mouth. It was by far one of the best steaks I've ever eaten.   The down side was the only option for dessertwas cheese cake.  I am lactose intolerant. The salad was a Caesar.  I don't like lots of dressing and it was swimming. It was good, but over dressed for my tastes.   The view was amazing. The city looked great as always. The room we were in was long and narrow. it was hard talk to others because of the narrow room.   We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The place looks amazing. It's historical and I'd with a look if only for that alone. From there on it goes downhill. The service was slow with it drinks. The did we was \"just ok\". The mashed potatoes and vegetables were cold. Really underwhelmed."}
{"text":"This restaurant is completely empty for lunch on every day other than Sunday. There is a reason why: it is overpriced and the quality is lacking severely. I ordered fish and chips, which were overly greasy and under-seasoned. The fish itself tasted old. A friend ordered a dish with rice that was soggy.  We did return for the extravagant Sunday lunch that included such options as smoked salmon, mac and cheese, waffle station, a mix of salads, and a typical selection of breakfast meats and eggs. My favorite was the automated doughnut machine that continually produced piping hot, deep-fried treats that were coated in powdered sugar or cinnamon sugar. However, even though the brunch was filling and fun, the place still felt like a tourist trap in which quality was sacrificed in the name of quantity."}
{"text":"This place has all the essential elements for a great Sunday Brunch.  1)  The restaurant itself is a very cool venue.  It is a converted / restored train station, which is absolutely beautiful.  The vintage photos of locomotives are wonderful to see.  Nice views out onto the river as well.  2)  The staff is very friendly and accomodating.  Good service.  3)  The brunch buffet has just about everything you could possibly want, and lots of it.  The food tasted great.  4)  This place has their own donut maker!!  How cool is that?  Freshly made delicious donuts, this place deserves 6 stars.  Come here for brunch, smile all afternoon..."}
{"text":"I recently had Sunday brunch at the Grand Concourse.  There were 10 of us.  I had made a reservation for 9:00 AM.  We were seated by 9:05, and the restaurant was starting to get pretty full by 10.  I was concerned reading earlier reviews about our group being separated but that wasn't an issue.  We were seated together.    Food.  We had six adults and four kids with us and there was something for everyone.  I enjoyed breakfast offerings (eggs, bacon, potatoes, sausage links, and waffles).  I also had prime rib, rice, and these amazing garlic rolls.  Deserts were great, and then the donuts.  Donut conveyer belt was fun to watch and tasty to eat.  Everything was delicious and I only wish I could have eaten more.  Service was spot on.  Efficient, attentive, pleasant.  I'm looking forward to my next visit here.  It was a great brunch.  Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"The restaurant is in an old train station. The ambiance was rich and it felt you needed to have blue blood to eat there. Everyone was decked out in one of their nicest. Except for my friend Reggie and I, we were in our nice work clothes and totting our computer bags.   The waitress asked if we wanted bread. Okay. Why not just bring it? It came with regular butter and salmon butter...damn delicious.   Reggie and I talked only about work and personal life. Nothing about dinner.   My dinner was ciopinno. When my dish came the presentation was beautiful: half a dungeness crab, scallops, mussels and huge pieces of fish swimming in bright orange base. My appetite was tripled.   Tasted the base with vegetables...delicious. A little heavy on the salt but still 9.5 out of 10. Next, the mussels...tender and sweet. Then the fish...delicious and flaky. Then to the piece de resistance: dungeness crab...major disappointment! It had been frozen. And yet the menu said their fish is the freshest!!! The crab meat was dry and fishy.   I am snobby when it comes to dungeness crabs since I am a marine biologist by trainning. I use to dive for those buggers between classes and would camp out on the beach to have crab bakes on weekends. Or I walk in waist deep eel grass beds and catch them by hand.   The sad thing about all these famous chefs and cooking crabs and lobsters is they cook the crustaceans in fresh water or under salted water. I cook mine in sea water as is what mother nature intended for us. Next time try cooking your crab or lobsters in sea water. Please do not over cook them or they become hard and chewy. Cook until the shells turn red and a maybe two minutes more. The meat will be soft and sweet."}
{"text":"If you are staying at or near Union Square in Pittsburgh, you have a lot of choices for food.  Tonight a large group (12) of fellow business travelers and I decided to try the Grand Concourse.    We had heard the menu offerings were quite extensive.  I would have to somewhat agree, although it was mostly fish.  Not being a fish person I had to choose between a salad, steak or 1 chicken option.  I forget the name, but I would have to say that the chicken was delicious.  It was a chicken cutlet, with Mozzarella slices and herbs melted on top, served over pesto.  Honestly, the pesto was starchy and a little plain.  If I had the option I would have opted for 2 of the fantastic chicken cutlets and they could keep the pesto.  My wedge salad was delicious but a little light on dressing.  That said, how can a salad topped with bacon and blue cheese be bad.   As for atmosphere, the place is beautiful.  I would almost call it majestic.  Maybe impressive is a better description.  I will come back with a group, but will likely try other places first."}
{"text":"Was there for a wedding so had a set menu. Appetizers were not served at tables but instead buffet, so some greedy guests ensured that not all guests could get some.  I think restaurant should served apps per table.    I had lobster tail and my wife had steak.  There food overall was very good.  The steak was perfectly cooked but lacked seasoning.  Dessert consisted of a cheesecake that was very tasty and very dense.  Great staff and service throughout the event.  The best part of dinner was the amazing view of the river and city skyline.  Since I don't know what dinner cost, I can't comment on value.... But I truly enjoyed my time here."}
{"text":"We selected the Grand Concourse because it seemed to be ideal for a business, adult lunch.  We had a group of 8.  I should mention that the Grand Concourse is huge - easily seating 500 people.  We were seated in the River Room, a large rectangular room overlooking the river.  of the roughly 100 or so tables in that room 3 were seated with groups of adults.  Immediately after our group was seated the hostess seated a mother and a toddler directly next to our group.  The toddler being a toddler wailed and was generally disruptive.  There was no children's menu so the mother ordered a full meal for the child.  He promptly dug in with both hands and proceeded to throw the food around the table.  This was very disruptive to our group, obviously.  My question is why, when you have a restaurant that large, you can see a group of adult professionals trying to have a lunch with adult conversation do you have to seat to a child under the age of 3 directly next to that group.  Why, when you have at least 5000 other choices do you chose that one?  Had the restaurant been packed, ok, maybe, but when you have a 100 tables of which 3 or 4 are occupied do you make that choice?  And by the way, it is never the child's fault - the poor decision and bad behavior was due to the restaurant management.   Needless to say, we won't be back."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like the Grand Concourse - so I made a reservation to take my wife there for our wedding anniversary. This was our first time here. I've seen the pictures and was looking forward to seeing the opulent dining area. Our visit, however, didn't meet our expectations.   Service:   - The guys who walked in behind us were greeted before us, despite us standing right next to the front desk.   - Our server mixed up our drinks and our meals between the two of us. There was also no attempt to make our visit feel special aside from a pre-printed menu that said \"happy anniversary.\" Reading other reviews, I'm sad that we didn't get the same attention and service that others here have.   Atmosphere:   - I'm sure the place is lovely inside, but we never got to see it. The entire concourse was closed off for a wedding reception. This is great for the wedding party, but it would have been nice to have been informed of this before we walked in the door for our reservation.   - It was very loud and difficult to hold a conversation, not lending itself to a romantic night out.   + The back room has a nice view of the city and we were able to sit near the windows.   Food:   + The rolls were excellent and were served with butter and salmon pate.   - Bruschetta Montrachet: Good flavors but unfortunately the \"crisp flatbread\" was soggy by the time it made it to our table.   + Caribbean Combo: Crabcake and potatoes were both good. The coconut shrimp with mango salsa were excellent.   + Filet Mignon: A decent cut of steak, but not as good as others we've had. Only 2 pieces of asparagus were on the plate. You'd think $27 would buy a few more pieces.    - Drinks: Overpriced and underwhelming at $9 a piece.   For what ended up as $50+ per person, I would have liked this to be a much better experience than it was. I'm happy to pay that much for a meal if the service is up to par, but it was not. As my wife and I were describing the service experience on the way home we simultaneously said, \"Applebees\" - certainly not \"Grand.\" In the end, it doesn't look like we will be back. We have been to plenty of other restaurant options with solid service and excellent food for less."}
{"text":"My in-laws have started a tradition of going to the Grand Concourse every year for Easter. It's perfect for very large groups. The buffet style is nice and the servers at stations are always friendly. I find the buffet a bit daunting in terms of finding out what is gluten free (not all of the staff was always aware, and it's frustrating to stand there and wait for an answer). The food was nothing amazing --but we enjoy it for the atmosphere, the building itself, and the capability to hold large groups.  I've also gone to their bar during happy hour on a weekday. Drinks were vary reasonably priced and the bar food was delicious. I love the look and feel of the bar too."}
{"text":"Grand Concourse is an old train station turned fancy restaurant. At $25 per person for the lunch buffet, make sure you come hungry-this place is not for the salad pickers.  The ambiance is romantic and elegant; there's often a live piano player. As with any buffet, it's important to remember that the food might have been sitting a little, so anything that can be overlooked probably will be- I personally avoid the cooked fish and chicken and opt for things like lox, the sausage with peppers, prime rib, and shrimp cocktail. They also have your typical brunch items such as eggs, bacon, and bagels, but for the price, you can choose better things to get your value's worth. Better brunch choices include the waffles with banana foster/ice cream station and the fresh design your own omelette station.   Before you fill yourself up, don't forget to leave room for dessert- they have a whole table filled with enough things to satisfy any sweet tooth.  They also have a fresh donut maker that churns out fresh donuts right before your eyes. A small dose of heaven, but so dangerous for my waistline."}
{"text":"between 4 and 5 stars. the food is absolutely delicious, but then again, sea bass is hard to mess up :P the drinks weren't as impressive, but the food and dessert are so absolutely delicious, for the food alone this place doesn't deserve less than a 4 star. the prices weren't out of ordinary for a fine dining place like this. the only reason I'm not giving it a 5 star is, well, nothing's exactly out of expectation good either. Wish I could give it a 4.5-star."}
{"text":"My experience at Grand Concourse was everything I hoped it would be. From the spectacular ambience and views of the city to elegant, delicious fine dining, it was all I wanted it to be. We started with the fresh oysters which were fabulous and the shrimp cocktail. Following that we had a Caesar salad (anchovies optional), the wild caught salmon meal, the peppercorn steak tenderloins, and of course finished up with three desserts and coffee because why not?! My only reason for docking one star was that the steak was over cooked which I found disappointing at a place like this. However, everything else was deliciously prepared and beautifully presented. Our service was excellent and answered many questions to help make our experience so special."}
{"text":"I really like the GC as a go to fancy/special occasion dinner spot. They usually have some sort of 3 course meal special that is great. The lobster bisque is my favorite ever and the bouillabaisse is an experience to be had.   Just a warning, it is on the expensive side, but I feel like it is also well worth it!"}
{"text":"My mom & I went here for the first time last evening. I made a reservation ahead of time & asked to be put near the windows. The view was gorgeous. The entire ambiance of the restaurant was beautiful. Service was slow, but I think our waiter was just a  little overwhelmed. It took about 10 to 15 minutes for him to come over & for us to even get waters. We put our orders in right away as we were starving! I ordered one of their speciality drinks, called a Spiced Apple Cidercar. Wow! This thing was DELICIOUS. hot apple cider, some apricot brandy.. Can't remember what else but it was wonderful. My mom got a margarita on the rocks & said it was very good. Our meals came out fairly quickly.. I ordered Chicken Pinot Grigio. WOW. is all I will say. I couldn't believe how wonderful it tasted. Mom got the filet & you could've cut it with a butter knife. We were eating off each other's plates & all we could muster up was \"omg\"  as we ate. Compliments to the chef. This is by far the best food I've ever had in Pittsburgh. I highly highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"PATRONS BEWARE - While the ambiance and history of the building are great and the food is good, the service was terrible. The servers had way to many tables to cover and the tables they were covering were all over the restaurant. In talking with the servers it appeared to be a management issue and how they staff based on reservations. I found this odd as it was a Saturday night, we called at 7 and got a reservation for 745. That probably should have been an indicator that something was amiss. There was a lot going on in town over the weekend - Pirates were playing the Cardinals and Cardinals fans travel well, the Steelers had a preseason game on Sunday afternoon with fans showing up Saturday morning, and the Roller Derby Championships were in town. It was a busy weekend and management should have know this so they could have staffed appropriately.  At a minimum you should go to the bar, the Gandy Dancer, have a drink and check out the history. If service looks good, stay for dinner. If not, there are other options in the area."}
{"text":"I'm giving a 4 because of the service: it should be excellent at a fancy restaurant, versus my below average experience.   The food was very good though.  I sat for about 10 minutes without anyone coming to my table...  Before coming to greet me and pour me some water, I could see my waitress chatting with another employee for about 10 minutes.  Then she went over to a table where the diners had already left, checked the amount of tip she got, and finally stopped by my table... I guess after that she did an average job, but she had already left me with a very bad impression.  The food was good.  I got cedar plank salmon.  The fish was cooked well and was soft and juicy (although it could have been salted less; I would go to Mitchell's Fish Market if you're looking for excellent fish).  It was served with roasted vegetables.  They had a good amount of seasoning and tasted great.  Overall, I guess I had a good experience: beautiful setting, lovely view of downtown, and good food.  The service should have been better, but maybe I was just unlucky with my waitress."}
{"text":"I come to this more for the setting than the food, although the food is quite good as well, but it pales in comparison with the beautiful station setting.  This is the ideal place for celebrations of any kind.  I even tried their Sunday brunch; the freshly made donuts are phenomenal."}
{"text":"Excellent dinner.  We sat in the area by the river (the main dining room had a wedding that evening), with a lovely view.  Service was A+.  Food was excellent - my filet was cut-with-fork tender.  A little pricey ($300 for four, including drinks, appetizers, entrees, dessert, and coffee), but well worth the price for a special occasion.  I cannot eat wheat or dairy - the waiter was very accomodating.  Dropping one star only because my plate was a little austere, with a piece of broccoli, two asparagus spears, and my unadorned filet.  I need to eat very simply, so I particularly appreciate chefs that make an effort to create a pretty plate for me.  Others at the table raved about the lobster bisque and the chocolate mousse (which is not on the menu, you need to ask).  Overall, a very nice experience and we will be returning - probably for the Sunday brunch next time."}
{"text":"Excellent Lunch Menu!  My Kiwanis Club meets here on Thursdays at 12:15pm, so I'm quickly becoming a regular.  I've tried to taste as many options from their lunch offerings as I can and I've yet to find one that I wouldn't order a second time.  Perhaps the only caveat to that would be that the fish & chips goes a little heavy on the breading around the fish so it fills you up with dough/batter rather than wish fish.  Service is quick.  The wait staff knows their stuff.  And the view (ask for the river view!) is tremendous.  For those looking to get away from the downtown hustle and bustle but want to stay accessible to work, the Grand Concourse is certainly an option that will not disappoint."}
{"text":"The Grand Concourse is a really beautiful, very nice, restaurant. It is located at a former train station where you can observe the features of when eating a really good meal. Went there for their \"Twilight Dinner\". This is a 3 course meal served every day 4 to 6pm. The food was exquisite. No doubt, the chef knows what he's doing. Specially when I saw my fried jumbo shrimp topped with mango slices. We got a Moscato white wine from Lecce, IT. Delicious as well.  Our table overlooked towards the city as the sun comes down, made it romantic. Wasn't very busy that time of day, made it intimate. Music was really nice, classical piano. Server was friendly and respectful. Overall, really pleasant experience. Would recommend for a very special occasion: marriage proposal, special date, important events. You know what I mean."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of eating out on New Years Eve.  Limited/overpriced menus, rushed/poor service, crowds jammed in with extra tables added, and mediocre food.  Grand Concourse changed all of this!  We had such a nice evening.  Our server was so nice, capable, and appropriate.  We had a very nice table, didn't feel rushed, and had a perfectly amazing meal.  We enjoyed the view of the city, space between us and other tables, and just overall a really pleasant evening.  Thank you Grand Concourse for helping to end 2014 and begin 2015 in such a nice way."}
{"text":"The brunch is really nice, but going there for dinner is just not worth it. Only went because of a coupon, and I found it too old-fashioned, with sub-par food.   Can't beat that donut machine for brunch though!"}
{"text":"Another enjoyable dining experience. The staff was friendly, knowledgeable and accommodating as we remembered from visits there in years past."}
{"text":"Meh.  Seriously, at this price point, three stars is being generous.  (Then again, it's Pittsburgh, so restaurants that would be mediocre elsewhere are above average for the area.)  Nice location, and the outdoor seating over the river is a plus, but I think people are giving that way too much weight if they're giving this place five stars.  Service: Meh.  Had to ask for refills on water, and the waitress didn't seem to know much about the food if it wasn't on her script.  Definitely not up-to-snuff.  Food: Meh.  Great food if they're charging far less for it, but I should be able to get something more than one notch above Outback when I'm paying $30 for an NY strip.  Made the mistake of ordering it rare; that shouldn't be a mistake in a good restaurant.  Location: Decor is a little plastic, but the structure is a pretty incredible place for a restaurant.  This saves it from one or two stars.    Overall: If you're out with a group where ambience is a big driver, this isn't a bad choice, but avoid it if you're looking for a good meal.  (Lunch outdoors is probably a decent choice, too.)"}
{"text":"This is an updated review for their Sunday Brunch! I made a reservations for my husbands surprise birthday and while they couldn't accommodate us for 10 people we had to sit separately which was fine (I had to make 2 reservations on open table). I was just happy to be able to eat there!! The staff was great too in playing along with the surprise.  The buffet was spread out throughout the main dining area. The stations include breakfast regulars, meat, fish/shrimp, fruits, waffle and pancakes, omelettes made to order, desserts, pastries, freshly made donuts, and kid station.   I'm so glad I finally got to try their brunch. Just make sure to make reservations!!"}
{"text":"We had our son's rehearsal dinner here last night and everything was great. The food was delicious , especially considering the number of dinners served all at once. The filet was excellent-very tender and done to perfection. The seafood trio was delicious as well and the portion was generous. The servers very friendly and attentive. The event planers Brian, who I dealt with mostly over the phone and Rachel who was there for the evening were great as well. I would recommend the restaurant as a beautiful venue for any special occasion."}
{"text":"The Grand Concourse is housed in a beautiful, old train station. The food is good and it is great for celebrating special occasions with family. Kids will be mesmerized by the donut machine that spits a perfect ring of batter into hot grease, where it spends just the right amount of time to turn into a perfectly golden donut waiting for toppings."}
{"text":"Overpriced for the quality of food although the restaurant looks great from the inside.  When it is warm outside, there is outdoor seating by the river which is a very nice view."}
{"text":"Great place, great seafood and sides....try the hash browns, amazing, and the chopped spinach salad !!!! Great service too, Jen in the bar is GOOD!"}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch with a table for 4. Not sure what the hype is about. From the waiting area to the buffet line this place is completely packed. For so many open tables and needing a reservation I don't see why so many people are just standing around in the way.   The buffet is spread out in about 5 different areas which are not visible. The donut bar that someone mentioned was in a back bar area that we didn't see until leaving. Nothing is labeled which is really horrible when it's so dark inside. You can't tell what is whipped cream, cream cheese, or butter.   Everything on the buffet was COLD. cold eggs, cold potatoes, cold bacon, cold sautéed veggies.  I know they have to make a big batch to feed all the people but the food wasn't even heat lamp warm.   Our waiter was nice and fast, the best part of the trip.  The bar doesn't seem to know the drink menu though bc we ordered 2 \"signature\" drinks and they came out normal.  The Filthy Mary, which is supposed to have bacon vodka and garnished with bacon, just came out plain.   For the price it would be better just to go to the Rivers Casino. Studio A.M. in homestead makes a way better Brunch.   I would have rather went to Bob Evan's."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in almost 22 years, but it was just as good as I remember.   We went for brunch without reservations. This gave us seats in the Saloon which I actually like better. A little more intimate setting and I think I was able to hear a little better because of the wide open space in the dining area. We didn't wait more than 20 min to be seated. You may want to make a reservation.   Had a Bloody Mary at the bar first. I wish I would have asked for a drink menu as they had a few different variations on the Bloody Mary. All in all it was a good traditional version. Nice beer selection and extensive liquor and wine selection.   The brunch had everything. Everything. Price fairly at $27 it offered hot breakfast items: eggs, omelettes to order, bacon, sausage, potatoes, Mac n cheese, waffles to order with bananas foster, you name it. They have homemade donuts, too.   Cold bar with shrimp, mussels, assorted salads and salmon 10 different ways. My favorite which was there 22 years ago....smoke blue fish pate. This is sooooo good. I could have just had the cold bar and dessert.  My mom and I got a waffle with bananas foster /ice cream for dessert...and then of course picked up a sticky bun and a couple truffles, too for sharing. My dad loved the truffles! They were delish!  The decor--stained glass is remarkable. I know there's a greater history with the windows being painted, but I don't know all the correct details. In any sense, just looking at the place is beautiful.   Definitely stuffed afterwards. Took a full on Sunday nap. I'll be back, but only after o fast for a few days."}
{"text":"The building, an historic train station, is beautiful. So it was all the more disappointing to realize that the food was mediocre and the service incoherent. The server appeared fast enough but left with only half the drink order. He returned with just half the drinks for the table and took the remaining order but then disappeared for a disproportionate period.  This sort of thing went on the whole dinner. Dishes failed to arrive or arrived out of order. The food quality was not bad. The gazpacho was good. the risotto was just ok. Group members having steak said it was good. The cocktails were ok but certainly not exceptional. In the end we felt like the food and service need much improvement."}
{"text":"Beautiful view of the river and the skyline. Inside the main dining room was beautiful. The food was decent. The server was accommodating to my request of ordering food not listed on the menu. I ordered Grilled Sole with Lemon Butter with rice and vegetable.  My husband and I shared a Fried Calamari appetizer. He had Grilled Tuna and Shrimp with Mango Salsa. We also arrived one hour before our reservation time and there was no problem getting a table."}
{"text":"Went for dinner.  Started with lobster bisque - excellent and calamari with peppers - also good; husband said the peppers were how his grandmother used to make them in a crock.  I had the scallops and gnocchi.  The scallops were nice and tender but the gnocchi while good, is more like an oblong potato pancake.  Obviously I was disappointed since it was not the traditional Italian gnocchi.  Husband didn't like the parmesan crusted shrimp with spaghetti.  He ate the spaghetti but not the shrimp.  I personally didn't think the shrimp was that bad even though I have had better."}
{"text":"Was very excited to come here for New Years Eve dinner. I've always heard great things about it, so I figured it would be a delicious meal. I was honestly a little let down all around! Maybe I just need to come back for brunch as that seems like what everyone is raving about.   First off the service was very lacking. Took too long to get our drink orders, and over an hour for our meals. There was 3 of us and 2 ordered fish and the other ordered a rare steak. No reason to take over an hour for that. Our sides of vegetables came out cold and my friends meal was obviously sitting under a heat lamp for a while. My meal was warm, not hot,  but it was still ok. My fish was prepared well and the rissoto was amazing!   The best part were the appetizers! We had the dynamite shrimp and bruschetta. The shrimp were so big and cooked perfectly. Honestly some of the best shrimp I've ever had! The bruschetta was also one of the best appetizers I've ever had. I would say it's more of a salsa though as it is served as a pile in the middle of 6 pita triangles with goat cheese. It was delectable none the less!"}
{"text":"Not sure where to start, but I'll give it my best shot. While visiting my relatives, we decided to have an evening meal and enjoy our hometown.  For starters, the service was slow, yet rushed when the waiter finally decided to give us a moment. The waiters were scampering about and drop two trays.  A female waitress hit my shoulder with a loaded tray and kept moving.  Not a single apology! Now, the best part...bland food. Wait a sec...awfully bland food. The smashed potatoes were cold and tasteless (totally inedible), two of our four entrees were acceptable, yet way overpriced for the quality.  If you like broccoli, get ready for a large head, non-seasoned, stalky tuber! And now the dessert...oy vey!  Creme Brûlée guys, not pasty playdough!!  Ever hear of rum sauce? Apparently not... Your staff needs serious lessons on what chocolate mousse should look and taste like...blech!  We made two trips that day to your facility...our first and last."}
{"text":"Too bad that such a pretty restaurant should offer such mediocre food. I was tempted to go with 3 stars here, as this place is so much fun to visit, and there were elements to my experience that I enjoyed. But that would be misleading, as the food that I ate only warrants 2 stars. I visited the omelette station first. This is a flattop omelette, so was more filling than egg, and I had to ask the woman cooking it to remove it from the grill before she overcooked it. It was edible but nothing to recommend. I got some sausage, potatoes and an English muffin from the hot buffet line, and, while nothing was terrible, I've had better quality food at a Hilton Garden Inn. I also gave the two fish preparations that were being offered a try. The salmon with hollandaise and spinach was nice, but the breaded white fish with capers was obviously a frozen filet and not made fresh there at all. I had read about the donut station, and was pleased with the wonderful little machine that spits them out and the donuts themselves. This was probably the best thing I ate. I always leave room for dessert at a buffet such as this, as it can often be the best part of the meal. I might have saved myself the calories, as the desserts here were the most disappointing part of the brunch...cake from a box, cookies from the store, and a chocolate truffle that, like the place itself, only looked good on the surface."}
{"text":"Last night was mine and my boyfriends 1 year anniversary. We decided grand concourse because I hadn't been here in years. I was very disappointed. We waited 25 minutes ( no exaggeration) before a server even came to our table. We were one of 5 tables that were sat, so no reason that the server was busy. She was apologetic and said there was mis-communication. Ok, it happens. Then the bruschetta was ok, the Caesar salad was god awful, the sea bass was creative, pretty tasty, and the creme brûlée was burnt and tasted bad. I don't think I will be returning."}
{"text":"as many others have pointed out --- it's over-priced($27 as of November, 2015) and mediocre ... skip this hullabaloo chain restaurant (yes, it's owned by Muer Restaurants.. it's NOT a local operation as a prior reviewer claimed.) go to the Shiloh Grill or the Harris Grill for their far superior Sunday brunch buffet extravaganza at half the price of the Grand Concourse brunch buffet ..."}
{"text":"YOU GUYS.  I had expectations set to \"medium\" after some of the brunch reviews.  But we went in for brunch (with reservations) and it was so great.  The food was fantastic, the selection was fantastic, and my only regret was that I couldn't eat more.  There was a serious variety of food (bacon, egg casserole, potatoes, peel and eat shrimp, apple dumplings with ice cream) along with the donut machine, a waffle bar, an omelette station, do I even need to go on?  The bloody Mary was good (build your own, if need be) and a full bar was available.  Next time company comes to town, I'm bringing them here!"}
{"text":"Went to the Grand Concourse for my father in laws birthday, this was my first visit to the Grand Concourse. The building is beautiful. The waitstaff was top notch. The food was delish. There is valet parking. LOVED the donuts! The only thing that I did not like was how the food is all not in one area, I almost missed the waffles, omlet and donuts due to them being in a total separate room from the main buffet but that will not stop me from going back!"}
{"text":"Reservation process was easy, they called to confirm two days before. Our dinners and drinks were delicious and on point. Everything was fantastic! Service included!"}
{"text":"Sunday brunch is definitely a worthwhile experience. The venue alone sets the ambience for an enjoyable afternoon, and then the selection takes over from there. Even with a large table the service was good and managed to be prompt. There was soooo much food from decadent to savory and you really could have breakfast, lunch or anything in between with the amount of items available. The \"donut bar\" was absolutely amazing, if you happen to be familiar, they are the quality of \"Love Peace and Little Donuts\" for the base and then you go ahead and select your toppings and essentially prepare donuts to your liking. The food would not blow your mind in it's taste or quality overall, but it is certainly a step up from your typical buffet  and nothing tasted extremely mass produced. It is going to cost a pretty penny to have this opportunity but it is something any good Pittsburgher should try at least once."}
{"text":"Had reservations for 5:30 today. From the beginning of our arrival we felt unwelcome. We walked up and neither one hostess acknowledged us till I said Hello. Once we were seated we waited 10mins before someone came to the table. Once the waiter came to the table we received zero apology for our wait and he seemed bothered. Once he left the table we both decided to leave. We walked by our waiter and the hostess and neither acknowledged us leaving."}
{"text":"Went there for a really good lunch on Valentines day. The food was very good ,service was great ,view was excellent! Nice wine selection too.  It was snowing which made it even more special. Prices are a little high ,but since it is a historic spot and its a place that everyone should visit at least once ,it made it worth the trip. Don't be cheap all of the time take the family to a nice place every once in a while. Cheers !"}
{"text":"Oy. What to do.  I've encountered a glitch along my 20+ year relationship with the Grand Concourse.  It's beautiful. It's posh. It has a donut machine. What's not to love???    Well, on my most recent trip with my lovely Sunday Brunch Club, I was fortunate enough to bring SIX newbies (+two returning, including myself) to experience GC's amazing brunch.  We were EXCITED.  The seating area was perfect; private enough for our dirty talk, but close enough to the buffet to gorge ourselves accordingly.  I began my feast with a trip to the carving station and shrimp bowl.  The turkey was a little dry and the shrimp a little hard, but I thought little of it. Plenty more to try, I always say!  My next stop was the omelet station where one of my brunch buddies discovered a hair in her dinner roll.  It happens.  She kept calm and brunch'ed on.   In total, my personal brunch menu probably looked a little something like this: one piece of half-eaten dry turkey, a few overcooked shrimpies, some salad (mostly for show), two pounds of Dirt (who says Dirt is only for kids?  Chocolate mousse covered in Oreo cookies crumbles? YES!!!!)  and three hot-out-of-the-machine donuts.  So - it's a 'pretty' brunch and the donut machine simply can't be ignored. But for $28 (including tax), I'm pretty sure the Casino and many other brunch establishments in our fair city have GC officially beat.  It's just not good enough anymore."}
{"text":"The brunch buffet was amazing.  Everyone loved The fresh donuts. There are a lot of people there so be prepared to call ahead for reservations. Yet somehow the place is big enough the lines are not too long to wait in for the food.  This is a great spot for all ages, families, dates, etc.   I'm excited to go back and try this place out in the summertime when I can walk off all the food that I just ate.   The staff was very very good. Both our server and all of the people at the different stations."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the old school charm of the Grand Concourse. Eating here is like stepping back in time in a good way. The restaurant is opulent and classy. There is a nice view of the river from the terrace where we were seated.   My boyfriend treated me to a birthday dinner our reservations were at 4:30pm.  There was hardly any one else dining then.    I had the Alaskan Halibut. This was my first time eating halibut and since this was a special occasion I wanted to try something new.   I was served a hardy portion of fish. Really I could have used more spice in the dish I just felt that something was meh about the perpetration.    The Grand Concourse is a nice fine dining restaurant, but I feel that they played it safe with my entree and it lacked flavor."}
{"text":"My husband treated me to Sunday Brunch as part of my birthday celebration.  We used the online reservation system through Yelp search and only had to wait a few minutes when we arrived.  The food was good, service was great and atmosphere special.  The only reason I didn't give five stars was I felt the the cost was a little high."}
{"text":"I feel like this is a place you should come on a special occasion.  Do I think there are more inventive and more fresh places with equally as good brunch food in the Burgh? Yes.  Do I think the actual history behind the Grand Concourse and the interior and reputation reflected in the price is worth the money? Yes.  I made a reservation for 5 of us for my moms birthday on a Sunday.  Valet is reasonably and conveniently priced at $7 for 3 hours and under. We were seated promptly and there was still a decent wait for walk-ins even at 1:15.  It was the first time I had ever been here as I will take a small, trendy place with good food over a fancy expensive place any day, but like I said, its a great spot for a special occasion.  Our server was great and was attentive without being overbearing.  The food was pretty good for the most part, but I didn't actually eat any type of breakfast food (egg, omelet, bacon etc) except a small bit of hashbrowns.  They needed salt.  I was very impressed with the Salmon Rocafeller they had brought out fresh and their mussels, although chilled, were hearty and tender.  The peel and eat shrimp was great too and I was told the prime rib was pretty dry, but the table favorite, by far, was the pecan cinnamon roll \"little pieces of heaven,\" as the Birthday Girl called them.  I probably had 4 of them and I am not even this least bit ashamed to say the last one I had with a huge scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.  The interior, as others have mentioned, is absolutely gorgeous.  The layout for brunch is very different as it includes a few stations where you can MTO the food as well as an actual buffet in the middle.  The only thing I found to be kind of unappealing and a downfall of the trip was that there was no system to the setup of the food.  People were wandering around and running into each other and it was a big cluster to make a plate.  My parents thought the food was excellent and all around we did have a very nice experience at the Grand Concourse."}
{"text":"I had my hopes so much higher for my Sunday brunch at the grand concourse.  It's was ok.  I don't really know what to say. I turkey didn't think there was anything all that amazing about it. There is a lot to select from but to me it all seemed average. The eggs, hash browns, and cheap tasting bacon seemed no different than any other continental breakfast I would get free at a hotel. The place is beautiful but that's it.  If I were to do brunch again I would save half the money and just go to the casinos brunch. It's just as good in my opinion."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch was crazy delicious. Omelet bar, bananas foster, carving station, delightful desserts. All in an old train station with gorgeous stained glass decor. A must do while in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Had dinner with friends visiting from Japan and it was great evening of food and drink.  Our server was phenomenal (I believe Robin was her name) and she really made the evening perfect and recommended a perfect Malbec and set of pinot grigios for dinner.  We had the firecracker shrimp, calamari fritto misto and the bruschetta Montrachet for appetizers; the filet mignon, bone-in ribeye and the snapper Milanese for entrées; then finished with coffees and the tiramisu affogato, key lime pie, bananas foster crème brulée and the chocolate lava cake for dessert.  Everything was cooked, plated and served to perfection and the ambiance, service and the view all added up to a 5 star experience."}
{"text":"I came here on Sunday for brunch. As always the food, selections and atmosphere are good. However, if you are looking for someone to get you a drink or bring you coffee-wrong place. The service here is horrible and he prices are very high. It's a buffet, why is it $50 per person? When I asked about why it took 25 minutes for my coffee I was told they were very busy. Many other places with good servers, this place is going downhill."}
{"text":"I really wish I could do a half-star, as I would give this place 3.5 stars - as I'm torn between 3 or 4.  The location and pure ambience of this place are truly spectacular.  It's a timeless, classic that almost makes you think you're stepping back into the 1920's or 30's as part of a grand era of dining reserved only for the elite of that time.  The architecture is pretty incredible too, to which I would recommend eating in the main dining area to soak in the \"grandness\" of the place.  Plain and simple - it's breathtaking...which might be way it gets some higher ratings.    All that aside, the food is just really good...not great or over-the-top in any way.  The service is fine, as well...again, nothing to brag about - just solid.  I think this is a place to reserve for special occasions or family get-togethers during holidays, but not something to put on the \"regular rotation\" for eating.  It certainly warrants at least one visit if you're in the area...just don't forget to save up your pennies for this place, as you will not leave without spending some bucks eating here."}
{"text":"Perhaps one of the best bruches I've ever had the pleasure of eating!  The inside space is wonderful, a mixture of 1920s rail station with neo-classical appointments.  Visitors are greated by a donut machine that trundles donuts through hot oil to their final destination of plain, sugar, cinamon, or glazed delight!  The food is grand, the building majestic, and the samosas or bellinis are perfect!  A wonderful place to enjoy a good meal!"}
{"text":"The decor is very beautiful but honestly the food is just bland. For a place so upscale i was expecting good quality food but was sadly disappointed. You pay more for the ambience than the food itself. The bacon cheeseburger with fries i ordered was on par with burger king. I ended up sending it back to the kitchen."}
{"text":"As far as ambiance, this place is awesome. It's located inside of an old train station and the details are beautiful. It actually would make for a cool event venue. The service was great throughout the meal but the food really wasn't anything great. The mussels and crab cakes are what I would recommend. The prices are Ok but the portions are small. I would return but I am confused as to why this place was dead at on a Friday night..."}
{"text":"With some time on my hands, family in tow, and a new year to enjoy I set off for the Sunday brunch at this esteemed location to enjoy a great breakfast! TO my great delight I was able to book a reservation straight from my phone through YELP*. Then when we arrived about 10 minutes early they promptly seated us before our reservation time and out at the windows looking out on the river and DAHN TAHN! What a great view for a wonderful brunch! Then the fun ensued! The staff was incredible... I especially enjoyed the cook preparing fresh pancakes and omelette he was friendly and made a mean omelette and a mean fresh blueberry pancake! Then there was the prime rib, smoked salmon, fresh doughnuts, and REALLY good banana fosters! Truly an enjoyable, tasty and beautiful experience! Definitely will be going again, and again, and again!"}
{"text":"The Grrrrrrrraaaannnnnndddd Concourse- I always tend to say it with a roll of the tongue, just for emphasis. It's one of the more fancy places to have brunch in the burgh- and it is also open earlier than most places as well (unless you want to have breakfast at a diner- which is also always a good choice). I visited earlier this month for the first time in years. We made a reservation in advance- this place gets packed. Our server was very nice,but it wasn't the best service I have ever had- especially for the price point of this place (over $30 a person). Don't get me wrong- the selection of food is unbelievable- everything was very good, but nothing was out of this world memorable at the same time. They have an omelet section- but they can also make you eggs anyway you want them- I had a sunny side up egg and it was wonderful. They have a waffle station, a fresh donut station and a huge buffet withe everything you could ever want. It's something to experience, that's for sure. They have a kids section with chicken tenders but no sauces near it- so you have to ask for sauces from your server. They have pancakes & waffles but no syrup or butter at the station, so you have to ask for that from your server. Things like that are a little inconvenient. Also- I ordered an orange juice and although it was good, it wasn't fresh squeezed- and for the status of this place, I would expect fresh squeezed juices to be included in the high price point. The view of the city is wonderful here & the atmosphere inside is breathtaking. I'm giving it 3 stars because, to me, it's overpriced for what you're getting. It's still very good, but it could be better."}
{"text":"Robotic donut machine was awesome and my favorite party of Sunday brunch. Donuts came out hot and a little crispy, so perfect. All around good food. Staff was great. We had a view of the city but the main room with the high ceilings had a great atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"I conducted a work function here for 50 people! The atmosphere the food and the service was top notch-I work for Fortune 500 company and this location is perfect to conduct such an event. A special shoutout to Colin, Scott and Brian! Thank you for all your help!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here two times both of which were quite wonderful. The food is excellent. Please remember that if your going to dinner here expect it to take a while, they aren't an establishment that is going to push you in and out. Service was quite wonderful and the location couldn't be better. I would suggest, making sure you can get a seat near a window in the outside room."}
{"text":"Food: 5 Decor: 5 Ambiance: 5 Service: 4.5 Value: 5  AMAZING atmosphere. AMAZING brunch. AMAZING price. SATISFACTORY service.  An absolute must visit in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Salmon was perfectly prepared and sides were very fresh and tasty  Early price until 6 is great bargain  Service was ok"}
{"text":"Just had dinner here on 10/15, the place was packed due to two weddings going on at the same time, with that being said we were sat quickly (10-15 minute wait) with a reservation (would highly suggest making a reservation if going on the weekend) overheard the hostess say if you didn't have a reservation the wait would be over an hour. The service was fantastic, our waiter was very prompt and really very nice. The food was outstanding, the Coldwater Lobster is a must. The next time I am in Pittsburgh I will be returning."}
{"text":"Service was painfully slow even though the restaurant was mostly empty for lunch. Waitress was a little snippy when we asked her to bring out the bread more quickly, so that the kids would not have a meltdown, since we were waiting so long for food. All told, it took about 80 minutes to get our main entrees. Otherwise food was OK but overpriced, and the venue was lovely."}
{"text":"Excellent Resturant for a special event as it has great views and decor. Our visit was special and this Resturant responded with great food and service. Our party of five had a great time . Seated right away and waiter was prompt and helpful. We ordered  the surf and turf special and others ordered the prime rib both dishes didn't disappoint. Tasty and appealing ***"}
{"text":"Great buffet....        The times I've went were for the brunch and it was always packed...which means good food right...? It was good food mostly always fresh... they have an omelet bar, brunch bar, salmon and tuna bar, fruit bar, waffle bar, prime rib and roast beef bar,dessert bar, and a machine constantly making fresh donuts, that you can dip in powdered sugar... O MY...I love it all but you pay for it in the price which won't keep me from comin back...         The food, but mostly the view of the inside of an old PHG train station from the late 1800's, the old wood work and plaster work you don't see any more in buildings... that will keep me coming back"}
{"text":"Beautiful stunning dining space. Calamari appetizer was good and with tasty sauces. The baked brie was super rich although my dinner partners enjoyed it greatly. I had the crab cakes and was disappointed.  The cakes had a bit too much filler and were not super filling.  It came with a mere two spears of asparagus and a scoop of rice. It was very disappointing. Dining companion had the sword fish which was a very thin cut.  The stars are for decent service and really delicious rolls they had as a starter."}
{"text":"made reservations and asked for a specific seating for my boyfriends birthday. couldn't have asked for better food or service or view. it was perfect."}
{"text":"The brunch is one of the best in Pittsburgh! The atmosphere is amazing. I came with a group of 7. Our waiter \"Greg\" was very uptight not friendly at all. He seemed like he just didn't want to be there. He did not have much of a personality and did not ask us how our meal was. The water waiter/busser was pleasant. I didn't want to tip our waiter because he did absolutely nothing to make us feel welcome. We came here to have a good time, but Greg put a damper on our day! I gave it 3 stars because of the service. When I go out to pay for a meal I'm also paying for nice kind courteous service."}
{"text":"This is my favorite brunch spot, always good food and great service. Pricey but well worth it. We have only had Sunday brunch there but we've gone back time and time again. Reservations recommended as it is an hour drive from our home"}
{"text":"Lovely Sunday brunch. Nice environment & cute waiters/ waitress. Love their ice cream with toppings, but a bit disappointed at the limited choices of fruits. Would recommend for the environment and price!"}
{"text":"The Grand Concourse is a restaurant in Station Square in the site of an old railway station.  It is famous for its Sunday brunch, which while moderately expensive is well worth the price.  It is difficult to get seated without a reservation, but the adjacent bar, the Gandy Dancer allows nearly immediate seating with access to the same brunch. Both sites have grand appointments including stained glass, an exquisite staircase and fine wood tables and cabinetry.  It is an elegant spot to dine.  Brunch selections are extensive, including carved meats, seafood, an omelette station, fresh fruit and other typical breakfast fare.  The dessert selection is exceptional both for its variety and high quality.   Ice cream, pastries and their famous Banana Foster top the list.  A polite and well dressed wait staff makes sure that your coffee cups are full.  The buffet is laid out well so it is easy to navigate.  Be sure to try the continuously made fresh donuts, another signature item.  Follow brunch with a walk along the river or a trip up the incline.  All in all this is one of Pittsburgh's best dining experiences.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Aqua Panna ice cold Shrimp Cocktail excellent great old railroad architecture  I had such a great time and Liz behind the bar made my Pittsburgh tour a fun place to start my snacks were great I did not want a big meal but the restaurant looked like a fine dining experience  My cousin who lives there told me it was a favorite of my Aunt Dolly & Uncle Carl's when they wanted a special meal The men's room out front not sure if it is attached to the dining room but it needs to be updated"}
{"text":"Went to Sunday brunch last week. We made reservations a week in advance and had our choice of times. We went at 11 a.m. and got seats overlooking the river and city. It was a fantastic view, it seemed a little more quiet than inside. What sells this place are the views and the stained glass. It is absolutely beautiful. Just the history alone in this amazing place makes it worth visiting. Our service was decent, but it was a full house and our coffee cups were empty a lot. The food was above average but nothing spectacular. What really killed part of the visit was the awful piano player. He played every song at the same tempo. It wasn't melodic and it certainly didn't help create any mood what so ever. It was very distracting."}
{"text":"Like Kristen H. I am giving stars for the beautiful architecture because the food was not worth it (every single food item was ice cold) and the bill was ridiculous.  We had been here about 5 years ago for a Sunday brunch and thought it was better than \"Vegas type\" brunches.  We were looking forward to an enjoyable Father's Day brunch, which by the way, when I called was told it was $24.95.  WRONG!  It was $29.99 (because it was Father's Day) and coffee was $2.95 each.  This is insane!  We have been eating brunch at Phipps Conservatory when the flower shows are in progress (only time they have brunch).  For either $24.95 or $22.95 (can't remember) everything except alcoholic beverages are includes and so is the tip.  By the way, so is the admission to the flower exhibits and you can walk through at a leisurely pace and spend as much time as you like!  The food is so much fresher at Phipps and the offerings a little more unique.  I will NEVER come back to The Grand Concourse for brunch.  it was overcrowded; we had reservations and still had to wait 35 minutes.  People were shoving in the lines and it wasn't a pleasant experience.  At Phipps, they only have so many seatings and they open the doors at exactly that time. They don't overcrowd the room.   No one else wanders in later unless of course they have a reservation for that particular seating and they're late.    As I said, NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"This restaurant is perfect for any up-scale events you have coming up, it's a rather fancy restaurant. I've been going ever since I was little.   The place itself is abso beautifull. It used to be an old train station, not like the modern day gross ones. It's elegant and there's a lot of stained glass      I'd recommend the early-bird special. (Goes til 6pm so go early) This is the best deal, and it has the best things on the menu. You get an appetizer, entree, and dessert. (I get Martha's Vineyard salad [actually ssooooo good], filet mignon or sirloin [comes with buttery mashed potatoes (personally not my style) & a huge broccoli (srsly it's huge also not my style because it's also super buttery) but if u like butter GO FOR IT] and last but not least the CHOCOLATE MOUSSE.      ^ seriously amazingness. If you don't feel like eating dinner or something, at least GET THE CHOCOLATE MOUSSE. It's actually legendary. Just get it and you'll understand my fangirling over it. Feel free to join in with me once you try it   Service is on point. Everyone is very polite, they were obviously well trained. You can tip these ppl big time.   Also, they have Sunday brunches. They're very expensive ($$$), but it's a good experience. The selection takes up about 1/2 the restaurant, (which is uh aloottt) and (not sure if they still have this) but they have a DONUT MACHINE assembly line thing! So fresh mini donuts man. Yes."}
{"text":"Ohhh, the Grand Concourse!  Definitely a place you're not gonna dine at everyday.  But sometimes a couple has to have a night out at a place like this!  Read on......  I borrowed an idea from a Yelp friend of mine (thanks Robin W.) and took my husband out here on a date last night.  I had to fly down to Dallas the day after Labor Day for a training seminar and I wouldn't see my guy for over two weeks!  I planned it, paid for it, and I didn't tell Rick where we were going!  I simply told him to make sure his best suit was cleaned and pressed.  I dressed to the nines for my guy.  I wanted him to know that I'm still his sweetheart and he's still mine and I was going to miss him.  (And as a side note, on the way over I laughed to myself 'cos I thought of the episode of the Simpsons in which Mr. Burns tells Homer he should treat Marge to a really nice night out.  Homer says, \"Gotcha!  Marge we're getting take out and we're doing it twice!\").  We began with appetizers.  I went for the almond encrusted brie  with apple chutney.  Rick went for the portobello milano.  Moving on to the salads, Rick went for the chopped spinach salad which had chopped eggs, bacon, radishes, mushrooms & warm bacon dressing.  Hmmm, you detect a theme here?  Maybe we should have bacon declared a fruit.  I'm almost sorry I didn't order that, although my Martha's Vinyard salad was out of this world.  Feeling a bit adventurous, I ordered the Applejack Sea Bass.  Now that'  topped with apples and sun-dried cherries simmered in a sweet bourbon reduction; served with rice pilaf.  Whoa baby, did that wake my taste buds up, but in a warm, subtle sort of way!  Mmmm!  Grand Concourse is well known for their seafood, but Rick asked me if he should order the New York Strip Steak.  I told him to order whatever he wants.  This was my guy's night out on me!  Whatever made him happy!  That steak looked and smelled fabulous!  The Grand Concourse is that perfect place for a nice romantic evening out.  And my friend is absolutely right.  Hear that girls?  Be proactive and kickstart some of that romance back in.   You've got to take your guy out some night.  Plan and pay for the whole evening.  Look great for him.  Remind  him of why you're his Sweetie!  Trust me...you will \"reap the rewards!\""}
{"text":"A once great restaurant deflowered by the lackadaisical piece of crap modern day work culture!!!! Shame on the management, shame on the staff!!! Dirty glasses in the bar but the oysters in the 1/2 shell were great. Almond baked Brie was cold, the apple chutney was all vinegar and the crute was 3 day old stale.. avoid that one for sure!! Our waitress was full of crooked lipstick covered teeth and the chairs were just plain dirty, eeewww!! The auxiliary staff was in the back of the restaurant acting like ghetto thug gang bangers, pushing, shoving and acting like the inappropriate fools they obviously were. The seared sea bass was cooked to perfection, no complaints at all. My wife's NY Strip was ordered as MedRare but came came out MedWell and tough as a shoe with a thick strip of grissle. Service was good we just wish the food would have been as well, the manager recognized this and only charged us for our drinks.   All in all it's just a shame to see this place fall to such low levels of quality."}
{"text":"Brunch on Sunday was aaaammmazing. They have sweet and savory breakfast items. As well as really good lunch foods. They also have seperate waffle/pancake/ and omelette bars!!! I went with a group of 7 and we were able to request a table river side."}
{"text":"This was my second time visiting for Sunday brunch and it was amazing.  My parents were visiting for the weekend  and thoroughly enjoyed it also. I made the reservation online, which I highly recommend.   The brunch is buffet style and there was a lot to choose from: *made to order omelet station *carving station with prime rib, ham, and turkey *banana foster/ice cream station *seafood *pastries and desserts *homemade donuts *pastas *fruit  *your standard breakfast items (eggs, bacon, french toast sticks,  sausages, potatoes, etc.)  I'm sure I missed some items.  Our servers were friendly and attentive.  Will definitely return and I highly recommend Grand Concourse for brunch."}
{"text":"not what it once was. our server tried his best, but this visit made me realize that the grand concourse is past its prime. we waited nearly 20 minutes past our reservation time to be seated, and then the hostess seemed confused about where she should put us. we ordered 2 bloody marys which came with sad, shriveled brown celery that nobody would consider eating and BACON. that might be fine except that my boyfriend is vegetarian and i dont eat pork. gross. add the snarky comments from the omlet chef about a request for well done eggs and its a wrap."}
{"text":"After a suitable cooling off period we gave the Grand Concourse a final chance. Our prior two dinners were extremely disappointing, since we had to wait nearly an hour for our table, even though we had a reservation. Both instances were Saturday nights and included my 85 year old mother. Last night, a slow Thursday, things were much better. We were seated immediately for our 6:30 reservation.   As in past experiences, service was prompt and professional and the food, seafood focused, was very good. Prices are reasonable. The real attraction, however, is the building, a beautifully restored railroad station. It's irreplaceable and a must-see feature of Pittsburgh. Give it a try."}
{"text":"We had a party of 17 for my niece's Sweet 16 birthday dinner.  We started with elegantly prepared appetizers that tasted as good as they looked (oysters on shell,  firecracker shrimp,  shrimp cocktail & calamari).  The 2nd course was Ceasars salad  & lobster bisque.  The salad needed a little more dressing & the soup was luke warm at best,  great flavor though. We all had something different for dinner,  the presentation was very nice,  flavor was delicious,  but unfortunately by this time we had been there for about 2 hours &  40 minutes and most of our meals were cold."}
{"text":"I might be biased since this was the place I chose to take my girlfriend before I proposed on New Year's Eve. Either way the food, service and especially SETTING are all stellar!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to the Grand Concourse for years. Always have a good meal. The best part is the ambiance. I had Mother's day brunch there last week and I feel that the quality of the brunch has gone down a bit. Would recommend for a regular dinner."}
{"text":"We celebrated my Mother's 70th birthday here, and everything was  Wonderful!....the service (Thank You Julianna!), the food, and the beautiful \"Happy Birthday\" song!"}
{"text":"Huge Fan !! We had a wonderful evening- Wonderful dinner !! The Grand Concourse is truly a spectacular restaurant in an amazing Victorian Era decor.  We arrived early for our booked reservation, they sat us quickly. Walking through the dining to the side dining was breathtaking.  Our server was friendly and very pleasant.  Dinner was amazing, from start to finish. I was surprised as to how quickly everything came out hot and prepared to my liking.  I highly recommended and will return.  The salmon was so tasty ! The scallop app was extremely good !! Highly recommend.  I Love Manhattan Clam Chowder, but Mediterranean Chowder was incredible!!  The rolls were wonderful!! But the best part was the Moscato Berry Sangria!!!!!!  If the Grand Concourse is on your. I let list move it to the TOP !!!"}
{"text":"The food and the service were simply excellent. We ordered several appetizers and they were all very tasty. Then I got clam chowder which was very delicious and home-made like, followed by tilapia provençale which was very good. Overall, everything was awesome except that we had to wait around 15 minutes even when we had a reservation, which is why it's not a 5/5."}
{"text":"I'm starting to fall for the 'Burg. This converted train station is a wonderful backdrop for the lake and city views of Pittsburgh. Many great food choices."}
{"text":"We had a nice dinner here. Right on the river downtown, it's in a fantastic converted train station for the old B&O railroad (think Monopoly) built in 1901. A Historic landmark, it has gorgeous woodwork, high ceilings and tons of stained glass. The music added to the experience and created a beautifully nostalgic ambiance; popular tunes from the 1930's through the 1950's with some classic show tunes sprinkled in. Sinatra, Nat King Cole, swing ballads, etc. really perfect. The food was nice too, fresh, local and light, nice flavor blends and  nicely seasoned. First the warm fresh bread was perfectly complimented with a salmon pâté alongside the usual butter.  Then the house salad was so good; pine nuts, raspberry vinaigrette, a light sprinkling of blue cheese,  and plenty of fresh greens, it's light and lovely! Enjoyed my Scallops entrée with veggies very much.  The desert special of the day was a peach and blueberry crisp, again, super fresh and yummy. Old movie buffs can picture Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert traveling through here. If you're like me, you feel transported to the past. I'd come back."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant for a business dinner. Appetizers were good, but entrees were not. I ordered the surf and turf and the filet was under cooked. The lobster tail was the worst I have ever had. It had to be cut aggressively with a steak knife and appeared to have been cooked several hours earlier. A coworker had a filet that was also grossly under cooked. Very disappointed with this dinner experience."}
{"text":"A great place to go for a special occasion, or with business clients.  If you make a reservation, be sure to ask for the main dining room. The decor, from floor to ceiling, is wonderful.  For a more casual experience, as to sit on the enclosed porch."}
{"text":"Ill make my review quick on here =]   -do make a reservation -request a window seat, worth the extra wait -both dinner and brunch are lovely here, although i do recommend the brunch -perfect place for out of towners -huge menu, something for everyone  i will note however, i see a lot of negative reviews, i just recently ate here on my trip home to pittsburgh, and had a wonderful dining experience, i took my boyfriend here for his first time!   Our service was good, our wait wasn't long, we did make a reservation, food was excellent, we parked valet for only $3!    I will return again, whenever I'm in town I always make a point to come here!"}
{"text":"After hearing all the rave reviews about their Sunday brunch, and having family visit from out of state, we decided to go to the Grand Concourse for brunch. The food was fantastic, with many choices. My only complaint is how crowded it was. I was happy we were seated in the Gandy Dancer Saloon, which is connected to the main dining area. The different buffets are scattered all around, so you have to walk through the dining area past seated tables to get your food. I wouldn't have wanted to be seated at these tables as others were trying to push past people coming in the other direction.  It was just too crowded and would be nicer if they could streamline the buffet stations to one area."}
{"text":"Apps and drinks happy hour 12/26 at 6pm, told waitress we needed to leave by 7pm, told no problem. 35 min for the calamari - tough and cold. 15 min later still neither of the other 2 apps & no site of the waitress. Canceled the order, manager took the food of the bill - know it's the day after Christmas but never expected the third string. A restaurant of this quality the manager should have comped the drinks too. Pitiful...."}
{"text":"I could not of asked for a better Valentine's Day dinner. Ever.   Don't get me wrong, I love mod-cuisine and all, but there's something to be said for classic, historical restaurants with exquisitely prepared food. Prime cut steaks prepared perfectly juicy, fresh seafood baked to deliciously--a true stick-to-your-bones American meal.   That's what I signed up for and that's what I filled myself to oblivion with.   Hello Surf and Turf. My name is Cara and I'm about to savor each and every bite of you while completely destroying any progress I've recently made on my exercise routine. And you know what? It's so worth it.   Service? Beyond impeccable. Our waiter looked like a bigger John Cusack circa High Fidelity and was extremely helpful. He made all our decisions, including the wine, ridiculously easy and seamless. He even introduced the bus boy by name as his assistant, which showed more class and respect for his colleague than I'd ever seen at a resto. He was knowledgeable beyond my expectation, but certainly not pretentious to the point of making you feel insecure.   What really iced this Valentine's Day cake was the the view, history and ambiance of this place. It was an old train station, intricately decorated with gold details, vaulted, stained-glass ceilings and hand-carved wood. The staircase was gorgeous but the view of the river and Pittsburgh skyline was the best part. The only better view in the house was my handsome beau sitting across from me.   This place is a true, classic diner's gem. You feel like you're in a page out of a history book here, and that's what I call a romantic date."}
{"text":"While my dad and I ate dinner here the other night, we discussed the fact that the last time I'd eaten at the Grand Concourse was before my senior prom, over 20 years ago, and it wasn't a new restaurant even then.  It's nice to find an upscale independent restaurant that has been so successful for so long without reinventing itself.  Also surprising, the meal was as good as we remembered.  The smoked bluefish pate and flatbread that they bring to the table is as delicious as ever, and my dad and I fought over every last bit of it.  The rolls were fresh baked and arrived piping hot.  We both ordered fish, and it was perfectly fresh and beautifully prepared.  If there's anything to complain about here, it's that the menu is starting to feel the smallest bit dated, particularly in concept.  The menu paid lip service to slow food, claiming that the produce was locally sourced.  However, none of the dishes listed any provenance for their ingredients.  Still, given the menu's claims, I asked the kitchen to replace the asparagus that came with my entree with a sliced fresh tomato.  Because really, is there ANYTHING better than a fresh tomato in the middle of summer with a bit of salt and pepper?  Alas, the tomato I was served might have been local, and might have been farmed, but it had also been refrigerated, and consequently was a letdown.  Had the menu not mentioned slow food, I wouldn't have had that expectation, and might have even given the GC props for staying retro cool.  Finally, there's the setting.  This is enough of a reason to eat here, and I don't say that lightly.  The interior space is nothing short of breathtaking, though I've only ever walked through it.    (Why, Grand Concourse?  Why won't you seat me at a table in the main space?  I can understand the slight when I was a pimply high-schooler, but don't I have enough gravitas for the beaux arts beauty of your dining room by now?  I BOUGHT A NEW SHIRT FOR YOU!)  Still, we could hardly complain about being seated in the railhouse off to the side.  The large windows gave our table a beautiful view of the river and the Pittsburgh skyline at sunset."}
{"text":"I was here for Mother's Day brunch last year.  They only get 3 stars bc the restaurant is so beautiful inside, and the brunch was ridiculously expensive.  The food was ok, there was a very long line for omelets--longer than it should have been but they are made to order so I understand that.  Things felt a little disorganized and as the restaurant was packed it was completely chaotic and not the relaxing brunch w/ our mother that we had hoped for.  The only time we were blown away was when my sister and i saw the amount our bill came to.  I was def wishing I had more siblings with whom to split this check.  The service just sucked.  Though we had reservations we had to wait and were seated out in a little porch area--which ended up being kind of cool because it was pouring rain and we were under sky lights so it was a little cozy.  However we were freaking PACKED in there to the point where I was unable to get out of my table bc the chairs from the table behind us were blocking us in.  I would probably NOT come to the restaurant if I were given the option of chosing where we dined.  I MIGHT go to this restaurant again but only if Grandma said its where she wanted to go for her birthday.  Ok--I might try the brunch again.  I do heart omelets.  But this brunch is not something I am going to go out of my way for.  This place is gorgeous inside but the over priced crappy food and the crap service do not make it worth while.  3 stars for beautiful architecture and great potential.  I want to like this place...but it just falls short."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst dining experiences of my life. The food was bland -- shrimp appetizer had an overly odd, fishy taste; Martha's Vineyard salad had NO taste; chicken scallopini was ok -- greasy but edible -- and the potato croquettes were burnt. Worst of all, however, was our waitress who was THE RUDEST wait staff I have ever encountered in my life. When someone in our party told her he was dissatisfied with his meal, she reacted to him in a vindictive, nasty manner for the rest of our dinner. Just an awful experience all the way around. I'm a native Pittsburgher and I'm sorry to report that this place gone down the tubes. There are plenty of other wonderful restaurants just a hop, skip and a jump from here downtown or up on Mount Washington. Don't waste your time or money here."}
{"text":"Review #700 (What a way to finish 2016!)  I remember my dad raving about the Grand Concourse in its peak, and it seems when it was locally owned. The restaurant is now owned by a large company, and while the building remains fantastic, the food and service must have seriously declined.  To start with the good, the interior is beautiful. I believe the building is an old train station, and it has the WOW factor when you walk in. There are dining rooms off of the main area with views of the river as well. It is truly beautiful inside and worth just stopping in to poke around quickly.   The wow kind of ends when you start interacting with your server. We were sat down at a table cloth with a GIANT coffee stain. I would say 8 inches in diameter, and mildly faded like it has been thrown in the washer without any attempt to remove the stain. This table wasn't in a walkway, but we had multiple servers continuously bumping into our table while they tried to get around each other in the not terribly crowded restaurant. It was all very weird, but my friend and I were excited to see each other and tried to ignore this.  After waiting forever for water, we ordered two appetizers, the Firecracker Shrimp ($10.90) and the calamari ($12). Both were good, although we preferred the shrimp. Our server did not hold the food adequately, though, so our entrees came out looking like they had sat under heat lamps for 10+ minutes. My Jumbo Shrimp Scampi ($18) was congealed and lukewarm. The taste of the pasta was good at least. My friend's Tournedos and Shrimp ($29) was also lukewarm but the steak was good. However, it was plated horrifically as well. The kitchen must have ran out of asparagus, and then put a whole massive broccoli piece on the plate. Like. What you would buy at the grocery store. You could not eat it with a fork and knife, but you could feed it to a horse. There was no acknowledgment of this gross oversight by anyone.  The big redeemer to the bad service was dessert. We ordered a slice of Key Lime Pie ($7) and a Dulce de Leche Cheesecake ($8). Both were delicious and not sweet at all. The Key Lime was amazingly tart, and the Cheesecake rich but not sweet. We really enjoyed the desserts.  All in all, come to this beautiful venue and just order dessert. Enjoy what it can do well, and avoid doing anything where you need exceptional service."}
{"text":"I've only been here for weddings but their food is delicious! Raw oyster bar is where is at! The prime rib was perfectly cooked and the potatoes were great. Servers were attentive and professional- what you would expect and hope for from a venue of this caliber. My only complaint is that the wedding venue is connected to the bar, separated only by stained glass, so we heard hollering from a sports game over the wedding ceremony. Bartender was great and offered me fresh coffee with baileys, even though baileys wasn't up on the display counter. If I had the money I would've gotten married here too!"}
{"text":"Meh!          Meh! Meh! Meh! I really had high hopes for the brunch here because all my friends rave about it.  I love brunch.  It doesn't have to be super fancy but has to have a few great items. Grand Concourse has a ton of options, and most of them are not good!   Pros: The building is beautiful.  It is fun to walk around all the food stations and see the building.   I got an omelette which was made to order.  It was pretty good with lots of fresh veggies and cheese.  The fresh donuts were delicious!  The coffee was pretty good too.  Sadly enough that's all I can come up with for pros...... Cons: The hash browns were plain, the scrambled eggs were plain, the breakfast meats were all average.  The breakfast breads were very boring.  There was a shaved meats station, which I didn't eat.  Maybe those were good?  There was a fish station that looked picked over and was dripping with sauce.  Not appetizing!  The cocktails were small, especially for the price.  The fruit station was plain, the salad station was plain........Overall, there are a lot of choices but nothing that was truly delicious.   On a side note: I went with a group for a holiday party.  We were promised a room for our group of 60.  When we got there they gave us the room, but had one table of random people in the room with us.  WHAT? It was really awkward as we were making end of year speeches and when we had a visit from Santa."}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch... It's been 8 years since I wrote a review for the Grand Concourse and I'm pleased to say that they are still the BEST choice for Sunday Brunch in the Pittsburgh area. Simply fabulous with way more food selections than you could possibly eat. The food is superior and the atmosphere is lovely. The cost is now roughly $30 per person, which is a little steep, but oh so well worth it. Make a reservation. You'll still wait for a table, but it might be a little shorter wait. (We noticed that they seat bigger groups first and table for 2s slower)  Ask for the Banana Fosters over pancakes. And go ahead and eat a few extra pieces of bacon with it!! Sinful. Treat yourself!!!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I have come with co-workers.  The restaurant is gorgeous.  The view spectacular.  We were greeted with a choice of a free calmari appetizer or desert.  The Calamari was so different and delicious!  Lightly fried with a schecuan tang and a delicious salad.  The lobster bisque was amazing and the Bass was delicious and perfectly cooked.  Only complaint I heard that the banana foster desert was average.  Anyone coming from out of town really should visit!!"}
{"text":"This my second time coming here. Was visiting my boyfriend last August and he brought me here the first time.  The restaurants old charm does not fail to mesmerize me. It's an old railway station I believe that they turned into a restaurant, how cool is that! You can still see the stools and chairs that you would normally see in a railway station in the old days. My boyfriend is originally from PA. And he has been coming here always for 30 years! The food is very good. I like the menu and of course their wine selection. The oysters are fresh and the New England clam chowder is to die for. We ordered from the Twilight Prix Fixe menu. But before I had ordered 2 half dozen oysters and the Almond encrusted brie with crostini and with warm  Apple chutney on the side. My boyfriend and his son both ordered the Altlantic salmon and I had the top sirloin. Salads and clam chowder for starters and vanilla ice cream for dessert.  All this good food, and watching my partner fondly talking to his son and eating while overlooking the Monongahela river, this place does not fail to impress me.  Plus they have very kind, courteous, and friendly staff. Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Not the most experience when it comes to seafood but luckily I have had the opportunity to taste the superb fusion of flavors presented by Alla Famiglia located in Allentown district city of Pittsburgh **** a Four star Italian restaurant that is expensive but you GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. The Grand Concourse was delicious but not filling - expensive but not filling. I will admit that I'm an American and weigh 230 and not just he European fitness model but I need calories to meet minimum levels to maintain my weight. The Chilean Bass was my first experience with the very mild fish! I didn't want to try at any restaurant but at one of the best so I can pass judgement onto others - I googled the fish after my meal and it was exactly as it described it! Mild so mild it almost taste like a scallop! So fatty it's hard to over cook this meal! The Crab Cake was out of this world **** and I order a version of my favorite fettuccine with white clam sauce with shrimp and tuna. The drink was different a version of Long Island  Ice Tea with a twist of Mango - I LOVE MANGO but all and all the atmosphere and location on the waterfront with the City on the shore and occasional train that speeds by give an authentic feel.... That's why it is called The Concourse!"}
{"text":"The food was okay. It was really busy on Easter Sunday. I don't think I would be going back, for the price you pay it was not worth it."}
{"text":"Apparently I'm one of the few who just doesn't think the Grand Concourse is all that \"grand.\"   I've had brunch here twice and both times I've been underwhelmed.  I've heard people say this is the best brunch in Pittsburgh and I have just one question for them...\"have you been to other brunches in town?\"    It's always packed and despite having a reservation, we weren't seated in a timely manner.  To top it off, the service was terrible.  It wasn't until half way through brunch, that the waiter returned and we were able to ask him AGAIN for water.  Considering I'd run 15 miles earlier that morning and had asked for water the minute we were seated, I was a little frustrated.  It also took us forever to get tea and coffee.  I actually thought he forgot my tea because it took over 15 minutes from when we finished eating and ordered it to when we received it.    And, oh the food.  There might be a lot of it, but it's not the great.  It tastes like a buffet to me.  Not as fresh or as flavorful as I would like.  Yes, they have their own omelet bar (not that the cheese in my omelet was melted or my fillings were hot) and their own waffle bar with more toppings than I could possibly want (luke warm waffles at best under the heat lamp), but I think they overwhelm you with quantity rather than quality.    Also, I like a little mimosa with my brunch.  And what I don't like here is that it isn't included in the base price (which they fail to tell you).  If I'm going to pay $25 or so dollars for brunch, you could at least throw in one mimosa.  Lidia's does....Point Brugge does...All in all, I spent $35.49 for Sunday brunch for ONE (brunch, mimosa, tip) and I left disappointed and unsatisfied.  On a positive note, the atmosphere is very classic and beautiful!  And the freshly made donuts are not to be missed."}
{"text":"Came here for a Sunday morning brunch. They have some of the regular American breakfast items, like eggs, bacon, sausage, etc. But given the $30 price tag attached to the brunch, you're better off getting the prime rib, live omelette, live waffles, and live donuts.   Their interior is fantastic. It's an old railway station converted into a fancy restaurant. They also have a marriage hall in the premises.  It's not very good for groups of size more than 7. We were a group of 10, so we were split up across two tables."}
{"text":"We were with friends enjoying a Sunday Brunch. The Grand Concourse has a reputation for one of the best brunches in Pittsburgh.  It's still good, but at nearly $30 each it is also one of the most expensive brunches in town. Don't get me wrong, it's still good with a wide variety of foods. The only thing that was of poor quality were their scrambled eggs and their bagels. They were both hard as a rock.  Most of the other food was mediocre to very good, but none of the items my wife and I sampled were great.   I liked the seafood. The peel and eat shrimp were more trouble than they were worth, but the salmon selections were very good.  Some of our party loved their mussels.   Among the deserts the bananas foster was a standout, but my wife really liked the made to order donuts. Table service was great for a buffet. However they didn't do the best job keeping the buffets stocked. The lines at the carving station were often more than 10 deep during our visit.   The atmosphere is incredible and might make it worth the high price, if only occasionally."}
{"text":"Beautifully preserved historical interior. Reserved a private room for our Renewal of Vows ceremony for 50 of our closest friends and family. The food was flavorful. We had filets and a vegetarian option. Not one complaint from our guests. The service was wonderful and the view off the dock was great. The ambiance is elegant and cozy. They even have Valet!"}
{"text":"I came today after my father's funeral and I am so disappointed with their service and food.  First of all, I made reservations for us at 12:45 for their Sunday brunch.  We came at 12:15 and the host said our table is being cleaned and will be seated shortly.  After waiting for 40 minutes, I approached the front desk again and said that we'd been waiting for 40 minutes...the host said they'd seat us now.  After being sat at a table for 6, our party of 3 was hungry and disappointed.  I asked to speak with the manager.  The manager said we checked in at 12:53 which we CERTAINLY DID NOT.  He said he'd speak with the host desk(like that would do any good).  I guess if you're not WHITE, they don't even acknowledge your presence.  FOOD:  Sunday brunch was not as good as I remembered it.  The quality of food went downhill, and the variety of food was not as extensive as before.  The bagel was over toasted and hard as a rock.  Eggs were runny, and potatoes were mushy.  The lox was not fresh and the fruit salad tasted days old.  Biscuits were dry and crumbly.  The only good thing was the freshly made donut that was machine made in front of your eyes...delicious!  I don't think I'll be coming back here when I'm in town again.  I'll definitely let my non-white friends know how I was treated."}
{"text":"After coming here for dinner two years ago and not being wowed, we decided to return for a Sunday brunch. I had a reservation and checked in upon arrival. The seating hostess told us to sit and wait. I soon after received a phone text telling me that our table was ready and to return to the host stand to be seated. The hostess kept asking me for my last name, and she told us to sit down again. Why did they text me that our table was ready and to return to the host stand?! We waited a little while longer until we were seated. The waitress was friendly, but she always touched the rims of our glasses with her fingertips, probably spreading mouth and other germs from dozens of people. She kept pushing us to sign up for membership in Landry's Select Club. The brunch was a buffet with different stations set up for omelettes, fruit, salad, fish, bacon, vegetables, desserts, etc. The food tasted good but did not live up to the hype."}
{"text":"This place is impossible to get in on a Saturday night without a reservation.  My family came to visit me, and this place was recommended to me to bring visitors since it's such a pretty building.  We made a reservation for an early-ish dinner on Sunday night, and the place was not that busy.  It was nice.  My mom ordered a stuffed salmon.  My sister had some sort of fish with a mango relish, and the boyfriend ordered something similar.  I had a seafood pasta dish.  Their pasta was fresh!  It was in a very simple (but flavorful) broth.  It was by far one of the best dishes I've had in Pittsburgh.  I don't know how much dinner was since my mom picked up the tab -- which is awesome!  My family thoroughly enjoyed their food and the atmosphere.  It was definitely worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Came here for New Year's Eve and had dinner. Food was excellent and so was the service. I got the surf and turf, and the gf got the new york strip. Steak perfectly cooked to order for us both (medium rare). Was perfect with some Penfolds Cabernet they had. The ambience and atmosphere here is amazing. The beauty and architecture is gorgeous. Want to come back soon for their famous brunch"}
{"text":"I personally feel that brunch is more hyped then anything.  Granted the Grand Concourse is my favorite restaurant.  Still the bunch is very good (not great to me).   My five stars go to the banana foster.  Thanks to the awesome person serving it honoring my request and taking out the calories for me  ; - )     That would have been great it he could have really done that.   I loved the banana foster.   Thank goodness to the very long lines to this that I only went up once to that.   The one star goes to the prime rib. I love prime rib. For me to eat this it has to be well gone or medium.  This is what I guess people call Pittsburgh rare.   Friends made a joke and asked if I just got that from the field.  However they do cut it very thin, the way I liked it.   A friend and I asked the carver if he had any well done prime rib and it was all very rare.   As the other food (way to many to mentioned) pretty good.  I eat chicken almost every day and did enjoy what they have that day.  Also there are some foods that are way too spicy for me.  Also there are a lot which are just right.  When the site mentions you get fresh donuts, they don't get much fresher than what they do.   You get them immediately once they are done and dropped on the paper.  Suggestion:  Have some of the prime rib that is medium rare to well done.   The décor is breathtaking.  The architecture of this landmark is an added plus."}
{"text":"Overall this was our worst experience there. Food was below average, service poor, and yes read on about the mouse!  My wife and I celebrated our wedding anniversary and dined at The Grand Concourse River Room 8/29/14, reservations were for 7:30PM.  We spend 30 minutes in the Gandy Dancer prior to being seated for drinks. Good drinks.   Once seated in The River Room, gave the waiter our drink and appetizer order.   The River Room was less than half full. He disappeared for nearly 20 minutes!   The water person finally came around and said he didn't know we were here. We asked him to see our Waiter. He finally came back and said, oh yeah your drinks. I'll go get them.   When he returned we waited another 10 minutes and the App finally came our along with a salmon Pate.   He disappeared another 20 minutes and came back. He took our order and I made a comment of where have you been, we missed you. He simply laughed. He just didn't understand that his service was really bad!  Finally we ordered our Entree's and another drink.  We were now 1 hour into dinner!   Well he then never came back with our drinks again, over 20 minutes. How can I be sure of the times? My wife got her phone out at that point just to track it! Again the River Room was less than half full and we saw him nowhere else.  Finally we saw him and we motioned him over. I said, look your killing us here. Where are our drinks and Entrees. He said what drinks and then quickly said, oh yeah now I remember, I'll be right back.   He did come back quickly with the drinks and then Entrees.  I ordered the crab cakes.  Keep in mind, we are club members and do visit often.   The food  was terrible. The Crab Cakes looked like they were under a heating lamp as the were dried and had burnt tops! The rice piloff was dry and flavorless.  My wife's entrée of the seafood pasta was acceptable but again lacked any rick flavor.   Since the waiter again disappeared, I just ate the crab cakes as at this point, who really cared.  Then I saw my wife look behind me and yelled look there's a mouse. Sure enough two tables down in the middle of the floor, there was a small mouse.  Two guys sitting at another table noticed as well and just laughed.  My wife was very upset to see a mouse in the dining room. Well it finally ran off and then came back again.  When our waiter came over, we told him about it.  This is where it gets crazy. He said, oh OK, did you name him? He says, I have a pet small rat at home and told us his name. I'm not kidding...  He just laughed and said they are harmless. My wife said yes we know but we don't want to eat with them.  He seemed like a very nice person but his skills as a waiter and his responses we not appropriate.   With that, we asked for our check and promptly left.  At the front desk I told the GM Milo exactly what happened from the bad food, bad service and of course the mouse.  He was very concerned and said he would deal with all of this.  By the way, there was never any acknowledgment of our anniversary and they knew we were celebrating.  Not sure what the Grand Concourse has come to but this was sooooo bad it was laughable.  We spend well over $120 for this experience not to mention ruining our anniversary dinner.  I would simply say, this place has really gone downhill, in fact we won't be returning any time soon. There are just too many other choices that I'm sure are better and the service better. We go out to enjoy not to have drama. This was like a bad dream. Maybe that's was the reason the place was less then half full on a Friday."}
{"text":"The Grand Concourse is located in a restored train station.  The main dining room has ornate stained glass and a high, curved ceiling.  There is also dining in a smaller, side room with river views.  Bring your camera for some fantastic photo opportunities.  We dined there on a Sunday evening and enjoyed the \"Distinctive Dining\" option which features three courses for $25.99 per person.  At first I was upset that we were seated in the river view dining area, but it was enjoyable to watch the boats and trains go by along with watching the sunset and how the lighting from Pittsburgh's skyline seemed to dance and play with the river.  Service was not the best I have ever received but wasn't bad, either.  When items were asked for they were promptly brought to our table.  However, in a higher end restaurant you usually don't expect to have to ask for water and bread refills.  Drinks were pricey (around $10 each for most) but that was to be expected.  All of the food was tasty and enjoyable although the presentation was not as high a quality as I would have expected from a restaurant with these prices.  I would have given it three stars, but the architectural beauty itself was worth the visit.  They offer free valet parking but the catch is that it is only valid for two hours and our dinner there for a party of five took longer than that and we had to pay a small amount for parking.  Overall I'm glad I went and do plan to visit again either for another dinner or their brunch."}

{"text":"I moved to Seattle after living in Pittsburgh for 25 years. The Grand Concourse WAS one of the best places to have a buffet brunch. It might still be a decent brunch buffet but no way am I coming back to find out.   I'm visiting from Seattle for the holiday weekend. We did not come for brunch. We came today for my sister's birthday -- which also happened to fall on Labor Day. It was the lunch menu.   I'll start off by saying that the two stars are solely because the dessert was free and that they sat us in the river room so we had the view of the city.   I will also make the point that I am a pretty food-conscious and flavor mindful enthusiast who really doesn't mind occasionally dropping a couple bucks for some artful presentation and effort. We had originally wanted to go to Eleven, but they were booked solid for brunch.   Our waitress began our experience by telling us that since it was a birthday table, we would receive the dessert for free. When we replied that was nice, she continued on to announce, \"yeah it's awesome because the management never used to do that but the servers took a poll and voted that birthday tables should have free dessert.\" Well good, now that you've announced blatantly that you don't mind knocking the dessert off your already completely overpriced 4top tab, we will be sure to give you cool points. (Thought that was a bit out of place to begin with.)  We then proceeded to order gazpacho and my mom, the lobster bisque -- which was decent and the gazpacho was tasty but the portion was slightly large for an appetizer and the consistency was more like eating a bowl of salsa, which I didn't like, but my dad and sister didn't mind. My mom enjoyed her lobster bisque just fine but said it wasn't anything special. It wasn't. I could tell by looking.   Speaking of lobster, upon entering we also passed a dingy lobster tank and I got a daunting feeling at that early moment. Come on. If you are going to be 1980s tacky and display them in a tank for the public to see, at least clean it!  At this point in our meal, the waitress asked us if we wanted bread. We said we did and she said it would be a couple minutes because they had just put it in the oven. 25 minutes went by without bread. At one point when she walked past the table and asked if we were needing anything I said politely that we were fine and that we were just waiting for the bread basket, thinking she had forgotten. She replied shortly, \"So am I.\"  Ok then, ma'am. Hopefully the person who p*$$ed in your cereal this morning didn't do the same in my entree.   The Special of the day was Sockeye Salmon -- entitled \"Salmon of the Angels.\" Being that I have lived in Seattle for two years, Alaskan Sockeye is one of my favorite dishes, no matter how it is prepared and I was excited to have it available. The entree was priced at 30 dollars, which is about double what it would be in a location closer to the source so I thought nothing of it and figured a landlocked city would have to price for importing as well. The description said it was served with angel hair in a cream sauce and Parmesan encrusted shrimp.   When it arrived, it was the most insulting experience of all. The salmon was about shy of four ounces and cooked through and sat atop a huge pile of pasta that looked like ramen noodles mixed with what looked like Prego pasta sauce, sour cream, and canned stewed tomatoes. Around the plate were placed three deep-fried shrimp that looked like the kind of basket food you get at Long John Silvers. So it was basically a cheap pasta dish, with a chunk of salmon on top and deep-fried shrimp. Gag.   I noticed that one of the 15 dollar lunch entrees was fried shrimp and I thought immediately that the shrimp on my plate was probably the same shrimp used for the other lunch entree.   Simply inexcusable -- just plain wrong. A thirty dollar entree should be a prize. I thought this was a chefs restaurant but apparently it is no longer.   Next time I'll just deal with the fact that I couldn't get a reservation for Eleven or Avenue B and forget it.   At this point the waitress never asked us if we wanted another drink, another glass of wine, nope. I wanted one but there was no way this place was getting any more of my money. I am the kind of person who pays for quality and it would have been fine if it was worth the price, but we were robbed.  We waited again for her to bring the check and even then she had to come back to grab our food to box it before bringing the bill. She didn't even have the kitchen label which to-go box of ours was which when we ordered the same.   Lastly, I'll say that I feel as if the service might have been worse because it was a holiday. Please do not hire servers who show their disdain for working on holidays to their table. I worked at a top restaurant on Seattle's Eastlake, and our owners would not have tolerated that for one shift. But then again we also served food that fit the description and priced it accordingly."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our dinner! I live in Phoenix Arizona and I was home for Christmas to see my family! Our dinner was wonderful and our server was great! He was down to earth and very knowledge about the menu.   I had a New York strip. It was delicious! The bread is amazing there, as well as our lemonade shrimp as an appetizer.   It was a wonderful evening out as a family. Even valet was a nice touch and not outrageous in price.   We will return!"}
{"text":"Sadly, a very disappointing $350+ dinner. It was my father in laws 80th birthday dinner. Once in a lifetime event. First of all, we received a server in training. She should never have been assigned to a special occasion party nor left alone as she was. The server training her was barely around. Now for the list of errors...ordered an appetizer, twenty minutes later was told someone else got the last one. Ordered a different appetizer are plates were already taken by the time it came. Asked for bread w our salads and was told there wasn't any made. Received it after our salads were done. My Cesar salad was literally a plate of iceberg lettuce w no dressing, had to ask for dressing. My husband's soup came ten minutes after our salads and luke-warm. We waited over a hour after our second appetizer for our meals and when they arrived, they were cold. One dinner came several minutes after everyone else's. Not wanting to totally ruin the dinner not everyone wanted to complain, however I sent mine back. The dinner started out by my father in law being told that he was going to have his pick of dessert for his bday, they didn't let him pick. Now to top it off, we bought $200 gift cards for Christmas ahead of time and received $40 bonus gift cards. I made two phone calls to make sure all was well with using all the cards prior to the occasion (one a month earlier and one the week of) and was told yes by two different people. However, during the dinner there was total confusion and multiple conversations about the usage and amount of these gift cards. It was extremely embarrassing and ruined the atmosphere of the occasion. The selling of the customer frequency card multiple times was beyond tacky. The atmosphere was noisy and the servers appeared to be spastically running around. Upon leaving, I discretely tried to talk to a manager and they made it anything but discrete. After talking to two different people, it ended with I'll make sure the next time you come in we will take care of you. Really???!!! First of all, I personally have fond memories of the grand concourse that are now tainted. Secondly, you can't redo a once in a lifetime event (especially when two people from the party flew in from out of state). Lastly, no one even ask for my name.  Overall a very expensive disappointment !!!!"}
{"text":"I was fairly disappointed with the Grand Concourse. While the food was decent, the atmosphere and service was absolutely not worth the money. I had never been there, but seeing as how it had been heralded as one of the best, I was excited to take my family there. Firstly, they had the number of our party incorrect so we had to squeeze another seat at our already fairly small table. The floor was unacceptably filthy.  There was bread everywhere. When we received our bread, we weren't given bread plates. The server offered to bring my 7 year old niece's juice in a kid's cup, but proceeded to bring it out in a wine glass with a straw. Eventually, we got the kid's cup. My mother's side of potatoes was ice cold. We all settled once we got the food because, as previously stated, it was good. Our meal concluded, however, with our server ranting for about 10 minutes about being asked to work on Christmas and stating how she'd rather be fired than work. I was surprised at how unprofessional it was. I've lived in the city for over ten years now and have been to a large amount of restaurants around the city. The Grand Concourse was one of, if not the most, expensive and well below all expectations. I would suggest Meat and Potatoes, Butcher and the Rye, Mallorca, or even Piper's Pub over this. You will get your money's worth almost anywhere else in service."}
{"text":"we were there for the buffet. It looked dirty and was poorly lit. The ladies room was 't fresh smelling  Our server didn't  come for several minutes. My husband had to flag him down. My husband asked for coffee and he just brought a cup and sat it on the table, no saucer. I ran out of water and the server never came so I went to the coffee station and got water for me and more coffee for my husband. The food wasn't that good. The prime rib was well done! We won't go back."}
{"text":"Dinner with a view! Food was incredible. I had the parmesan-crusted jumbo shrimp, lump crab, savory tomato beurre blanc, and angel hair pasta dish. The brie cheese appetizer was phenomenal We had a seat overlooking the river, which was nice to see the water and city lights. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"3.5 is a fair score. To me, Grand Concourse has a difficult dilemma. Food is ok, but not great, there are better options. The view is also ok, but there are better. The inside is beautiful, and the sunroom downtown view is good, but it cannot beat the view from the top of Mt. Washington. So Grand Concourse kind of goes to the \"celebration / special event\", but I always end up going somewhere up Mt. Washington. (my last wedding anniversary was on Mt. W)  Been at Grand Concourse twice, one as a business brunch and the other one was taking my visiting mother for lunch. We had the \"power lunch\" sets. Clam chowder was good. Very filling. It was rich and chunky, lots of potato and clams. It really fills you up.   We had shrimp artichoke pasta and salmon burgers. Pasta was alright but does not stand out. Salmon burger was a bit disappointing, and I blame myself for it. I was expecting a salmon FILLET burger, not a salmon PATTY burger. I can name two places that would give me a salmon fillet burger at this price range. If Strip District can offer me that, I expect nothing less from Grand Concourse.  I had a Blue Crab Club Sandwich a long time ago, and that was delicious.   Final note, if it is a romantic date, go to Mt Washington. This is more like business/birthday events. And since you cannot improve the view, I guess you can only improve the food."}
{"text":"This past Sunday, a dear friend held a very adult 30th birthday at the Grand Concourse Sunday Brunch buffet. I have not been in this restaurant in...years. It has been forever. The lobby is lovely, and valet is reasonably priced if you don't want to walk to a parking lot. While the Sunday brunch crowd is not a particularly dressy bunch, I recommend wearing something nice. The Snookie look alike in hot pink sweat pants that said \"PINK\" across the bottom stuck out like a sore thumb...but that may have been in part, because she was cursing like a sailor while waiting for valet...c'mon folks. It's Sunday.   But I digress.   We made our way to the table and the whole room is just breathtaking. The staircase leading to the room was often frequented by people having photographs taken. There were several different buffets including your standard brunch items (which were all delicious) as well as some seafood options-shrimp and mussels-salad, some pasta, fresh carved meat, an omelet bar, an ice cream sundae bar, and fresh waffles with yummy bananas foster. Another delicious treat? The fresh doughnuts from the doughnut machine. They roll right off a little conveyor belt and you dip them in powdered or cinnamon sugar...I personally opted to put some of the goo from my bananas foster on my doughnut...SO heavenly.   The only gripe I have? It's a bit crowded. The layout does not lend itself to easy transportation. Because it is an old train station, there are charming obstacles that add to the charm, but take away from the ease and flow. Some of this frustration comes from parents who do not know how to control their annoying children who want to tap the lobster tank (you are in the middle of the road and causing traffic which is causing me anxiety), but it was only mildly annoying. This is unavoidable given the structure, but totally worth it because of the feel of the building and the quality of the food.   Our service was fabulous-water was always filled, plates were cleared promptly so you could go up for seconds...thirds...there were a few who went for fourths at our table. Needless to say, this fills you up for the whole day. I went home and had a traditional \"Sunday afternoon-after-lunch-after-chuch-nap.\" It was glorious, and I credit that to my delicious brunch."}
{"text":"I'm going to speak for the Sunday brunch buffet.... WORTH EVERY PENNY! We have booked / made reservations at this place three times in the past 6 months because we're that impressed! We spent Christmas Eve here brunching, Easter Sunday, and we have reservations for Mother's Day/ Father's Day as well.   The buffet is massive! An entire area designated to omelettes, freshly made donuts, bananas foster, and then a giant spread of all things breakfast related. The food is delicious, the ambiance is spectacular (the entire building used to be a train station) and the views of the city from the river room are outstanding.   My only complaint, the drinks didn't blow me away. My mimosa was okay and the Bloody Mary seemed to lack a kick.   Give this brunch a try! It's outstanding and my fav in the city !!!"}
{"text":"While atmosphere was impressive food was average at best. Fish was good, potatoes were old. They were brown and dry. The veggie was asparagus which was good but only served 2 stalks. I guess asparagus is scarce in western Pa.  Asked waiter change for the valet and was told he was busy and it would take a few minutes for him to get it. Had clam chowder as well. Clams were tender but soup had little flavor and was so thick it clung to the spoon at the end. A new chef and creative flare to the menu is essential."}
{"text":"I went for brunch today it was very good. Our waiter Colin was very attentive to our needs. He received a 20% tip. The roasted chicken was cooked just right and  it was very flavorful and not dry. The beef at the carving station was cooked medium which was perfect for me. I had the Moscato Bellini it taste good, I just wished the glass were bigger. The dessert was ok...my favorite was the sticky buns. The manager was very nice as it came close to 3p.m. he went to every table to see if we wanted more food before they took everything away. I would recommend the Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"Brunch here is incredible! I loved sitting in the sunroom overlooking the water. There are brunch cocktail options that are fun and pretty inexpensive. I got the hibiscus prosecco which actually come with a flower inside the drink. The buffet options are so diverse and delicious. The highlights for me were the prime rib and donut machine. Other fun options include dirt pudding, bananas foster Station, Mac and cheese, Swedish fish, Belgian waffle bar, omelette bar and traditional breakfast options like eggs, sausage and bacon. The food was very good and the atmosphere of the restaurant is so fun and lively. Our waiter also brought me a little dessert bite with a candle because we were celebrating my birthday!"}
{"text":"I don't know why we've waited so long to get brunch here.  I've heard people rave about it, yet, we only went for the first time this past weekend.  Holy cow, it was AMAZING.  There was pretty much everything you would normally expect on a brunch buffet...eggs, sausage, hash browns, waffles...but then, there was also lox with cream cheese, bagel and capers, prime rib, fresh made donuts, all sorts of pastries, an omelet station...anything and everything you could want, was there.  The fresh made donuts were possibly best of all - warm, wonderful, sugary...mmm...I can't wait to go back.  I'm in love."}
{"text":"I still dream about their Sunday brunch, even though we moved out of state 5 years ago. Nowhere has ever compared!   This place truly delivers when it comes to brunch. There is something for everyone, from an omelet station, your traditional breakfast foods like waffles, pancakes, eggs, sausage, bacon, bagels, lox, fruit, to pasta, roast beef, seafood, and even a fresh donut machine. There is also a kids table with French toast sticks, sour patch kids, pb & j's, chicken tenders, and a few other kids items. I did sneak  few sour patch kids from time to time though ;-)   Their coffee is also amazing, so don't forget to order that. And when you make your reservation (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED), ask for the waterfront room.  For anyone who doesn't enjoy this brunch, I'd love to know where you've had better."}
{"text":"Went there for Sunday Brunch last weekend. The place itself is beautiful. Tall ceilings and a very old-timey feel. We ate in the \"saloon.\" There is a piano player playing music the entire time and it sets a nice atmosphere. The food itself is very good and there is plenty to choose from. As previous reviewers have said they have tons of breakfast, lunch, and dessert foods. My favorite was the crispy bacon and the waffles with bananas foster over them. I also enjoyed the variety of smoked salmon. The only downfall of this place is the price per person. I know you get what you pay for for $26.95 seems slightly excessive for the amount of food you eat (I got really full quickly from the giant variety). Overall if you have the money, it's a great way to spend a sunday morning/afternoon.  Also a neat additional feature is that you're within walking distance to the incline plane which we think runs free on the weekends. It's nice to get a view of the city on a sunny day."}
{"text":"Set in a beautiful building, Grand Concourse is grand, but the food has been inconsistent among the five times I have had dinner there. It is a good place for large events. The interior is beautiful. However, I would expect better consistency in food. I am a seafood fan, and I have had both very mediocre seafood and very good (but not excellent) seafood here."}
{"text":"Brunch here is EVERYTHING!! The location is amazing, beautiful stained glass and old world feel. The food was stellar. So many options from breakfast to lunch, quality omelettes, fruit, seafood etc. The donut maker was my favorite. They come out warm on the outside and gooey on the inside. I just wish I didn't get so full!"}
{"text":"We just went in for lunch and it was great! I had the lunch special with clam chowder and a shrimp Caesar salad. I wish the salad was more cold but the shrimp was great. We sat in the side room over the river- next time I'll ask to be seated in the main dining room. It's absolutely beautiful. The service was very good here. We will go back for sure."}
{"text":"I really enjoy The Grand Concourse. My dinner experiences have been good, but the thing that I love most is the All-You-Can-Eat Sunday Brunch buffet; I am not a person that likes buffets. A tad pricey at almost $30 a person, it is definitely worth it since all of the items are fresh. Did I mention they have prime rib?  On each of my dinner excursions, I have had something special made for me by the chef due to allergies, and each time it was really good. More often than not, though, if I am going to The Grand Concourse it is because I am at the Sunday Brunch eating prime rib. It has gotten to the point where I actually have a routine. That routine always ends with a fresh cinnamon sugar doughnut with a chocolate truffle in the doughnut hole covered in warm bananas foster."}
{"text":"I booked a special group dinner event for my mother's 90th Birthday. We had a total of 30 guests including 5 of her great great grand children.  Because of our small group we were seated in the \"Ladies Waiting Room\" that is a part of this grand old train station that has been brought back to its former glory.   Group events do not generally rate my high expectations.  The Grand Concourse has, in my mind, raised the bar.  The service was exemplary.  The food was very good.  I felt that everyone from Brian and Jennifer in the banquet office to the servers to the kitchen staff were all a big plus in bringing our event to a successful conclusion.  The grand Concourse team demonstrated to me and all of our guests that they really care."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is amazing, high ceilings, stained glass and amazing charm but that's what you're paying for. Granted I went as part of an event so I'm sure the kitchen was under a good bit of stress but the food was very basic and my steak was highly average. Im glad I went once for the experience but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Location, location, location. Without it this would be just another mediocre restaurant passing itself off for a great place to eat. In today's amazing world of eateries this joint needs serious reinvention."}
{"text":"Stunning restaurant space with excellent food. The thing that ruined the experience for me, without a doubt, was the chain-restaurant-like service our large party received.  We were in town for my sister's graduation from Duquesne and took a mixed family party of about 16 people to an early (5:30) Friday dinner. Since we had one child under the age of 10, and two teenagers with, we wanted to be respectful of later dining guests and planned accordingly. Our server began service by asking about drinks, before I'd even seen a wine list or cocktail menu--made an on-the-fly decision for wine (the by the glass selection is okay to fair), and brought them back quickly--great pace. Then it got rough.   Rather than addressing our table in a professional way, she yelled over our conversation, \"Are you ready to order yet?\" after we declined appetizers. Any veteran service person could have found a more tactful way to address our party from the end of the table. When she began taking orders, she became visibly upset and short when it was apparent a majority of us were choosing from the prix fixe menu, despite the alcohol we'd already purchased and the guest count that guaranteed a large end bill, at a per-cover price of at least $25.   When refilling water and delivering food, our server reached over our party's heads, spilled on our table and my hand without apology, handed plates to our party rather than place them on the table, and cattle-called our entrees and desserts because she couldn't be bothered to note who had what when she delivered it. Our conversation was continually interrupted because of her inability to execute basic service strategy, which was incredibly frustrating. Even more so, when we didn't answer her immediately which person had what dish, she spoke louder and shorter, muttering within ear and eyeshot to another server as she walked away from our table. There was ample opportunity to upsell us on alcohol, but she made no attempt when any of our wine glasses were near empty. A manager visit to the table, especially with such a large party would have been an appreciated move to smooth it over.   I work every day in and with restaurants--this was the service I expected at a Chilis or an Applebee's, but not at a beautiful restaurant like we dined in. Our tip was a generous 20% despite the service, but it could have been far more if even an ounce more care would have been given to our experience.   Despite the server, the food was exceptional. I chose the Martha's Vineyard salad, Crab Cakes and chocolate mousse... the Crab Cakes may have been the best I've had to date. Portions were more generous than expected, which was a nice surprise.   I'd give this place 4-5 stars if the service would have been even slightly better, but if I had been on a date here, I would have been embarrassed by the hospitality shown to us. Be warned with a large party, and be wary in a date situation."}
{"text":"We went here for a family dinner. Everything was excellent. The views of Pittsburgh and the river are awesome. The building, a former train station is gorgeous.   I ordered the filet mignon, it was cooked perfectly like I ordered. The side of potatoes were amazing.   This is definitely an awesome place to go if you are visiting from out of town."}
{"text":"Brunch here is amazing!!! I came here for my 30th birthday with my family and everyone loved the food.  Our waitress was also super sweet :)"}
{"text":"If there was a way to rate below I would choose that rating for their TERRIBLE lack of service. We picked this restaurant because of previous reviews and the venue is beautiful. We made a reservation 7:30 pm, we arrived a few minutes late 7:40 pm and were seated. We waited over 30 minutes with NO acknowledgement from anyone, we did not even get water brought to the table. Oh I forgot to mention we were seated in an area with no one around, NOT sure what the reason for that was either. The restaurant closes at 9:00 om so at about 8:15 pm we got up and preceded to leave, stopped at the front and asked to speak to the manager Thomas, who should NOT be in management I would be concerned if he was managing my business as he clearly does not have any hospitality management experience. I informed him of the above and Thomas \" the manager\" was very non chalant about it, didn't apologize nothing, asked if we wanted to be seated somewhere else?? why would we want to?? to wait more and get ignored, it's as if they wanted us to leave. VERY disappointing as my fiance and I were visiting Pittsburgh for the first time and looking forward to a good experience!!! The person that was apologetic was the valet, kudos to him perhaps he should be restaurant manager. I sincerely hope the Owner reads this and improves on the experience, being in hospitality I know it is about the EXPERIENCE which this is one we wish to forget!!!"}
{"text":"View, food, and staff were so great.  We got to watch the sun set on the river and city.  It was beautiful!  We really enjoyed celebrating our 10 year anniversary here.  We had a reservation and they got us right into our table.  The even gave us a free desert, which was amazing!  We also love walking outside by the river afterwards. They also were very nice in giving us directions after dinner to our next stop.  We rode the T train for $2.50 a person straight to the casino."}
{"text":"So, my first review for 2016 and I have to give an iconic Pittsburgh restaurant only two stars.   This isn't my first rodeo with the Grande Concourse, I've been to the Sunday brunch buffet on numerous occasions. I'm not sure why I haven't reviewed this before. It's gone way downhill! First, it's very confusing, no flow to the traffic patterns, people walking at you, trying to get around you, everyone is in a hurry to beat the person in front of them. Not much by way of vegetarian or vegan options. Luckily I do eat salmon, so I headed to the smoked salmon station. You'd think the bagels would be with the lox? No, they were on the main buffet line and lucky me, the only bagels there were cinnamon raisin. I asked the attendant if there were any savory bagels and he was nice enough to refresh the choices. Unfortunately they were cold! Smart me went to where they were making omelette sand asked the attendant if he could grill my bagel. Not only did he slice it, while I waited he made me an egg white omelette with lots of fresh veggies. With warm bagel in tow, I headed make to the smoked salmon and lox table.   2nd complaint, nothing is marked, so when I thought I was shmearing my bagel with cream cheese, I found out after the first bite it was butter. We interrupt this review for a Joe D. editorial, \"butter and lox do not pair well, that is all.\" Okay, back to the review, is it hard to mark the offerings? A sign marking the butter and cream cheese would have been nice. I saw a very nice looking pasta dish only to find out it was loaded with bacon. A sign reading the dish's name and ingredients would be a nice touch. The potatoes were dry from sitting under a heat lamp, the kids in our party wanted ketchup for their chicken fingers and couldn't find any, finally the waitress came over and she brought back bowls of ketchup. It's just not a well laid out buffet. The food is not worth the 37.50. There are better buffets that are less crowded, and better equipped to handle people with dietary needs."}
{"text":"I have been fortunate to have traveled quite a bit in my life.  Pittsburgh for some reason was just one of those cities I had never been to - until this past weekend.  A recommendation from a friend of mine led me to Grand Concouse, and their brunch most specifically  \"Holy cow, the best brunch I have ever been to period.....you have to go\".  I could not leave Pittsburgh without a stop.  This place is as magnificent as was described. Walking in the front door I know I am going to spend $35+ on brunch and probably not care.  An opulent converted train station from time long past.  Grand staircase, glossy tile, stained glass, majestic vaulted ceilings, lush green plants, carved wood, live piano,  and polished brass rails.  Not so polished hostess.   There was no line in front of the hostess stand, just a woman on her side of the barrier poking at a computer screen.  I waited.  I waited some more.  I raised my hand and placed it on the wood rail.  FINALLY a response.  No other contact, except verbal and vaguely directed towards me burst with mouth pointed in another direction - \"I'll be with you\".  Another few moments go by and finally we talk and make eye contact.  I was by myself traveling on business, which I extended into a long weekend.  I asked for a seat for brunch.  Somehow this seemed to stun this woman.  Was I the very first person with such a request?   After gathering her thoughts, she said that she could offer a reservation such as mine , (not sure what that means) a seat in the adjacent Gandy Dancer Saloon.   Was I too white?  Was I too overweight and she wanted to impart exercise into my eating regime?  I thought I was dressed properly....  What could this possibly mean?   Insulted but knowing I still had access to the brunch, minus some of the stellar  view, I was in, and thrilled.  I was not going to be broken.  I happily had a seat adjacent to the bar.  Gandy Dancer Saloon front row seating  to my right, buffet extraordinaire across the way to my left....happy and excited man.  I was greeted by the bartender, a 2nd generation Irish man, minus the cheezy fake accent at my seat.  Quick conversation, and I had a stellar Woodford Reserve Old Fashioned to calm my equally muddled nerves.  I was ready.  Finally the service matched what  was expecting.  I was instructed how to attack this impending magnificent display.  Within sight was a machine with fresh made to order donuts which I happily dipped in powdered sugar and cinnamon.  This alone (along with my Old Fashioned) could have made my day.  I was ready for action.  From there I walked into the main room, past the dessert section, complete with made to order Bananas Foster.  Just past that was another assortment of other sweet indulgences.  Steps away was a chef making omelettes to order.  Wow. This brunch is amazing.    The main stations include scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, hash browned potatoes, a carving station with ham, turkey, and prime rib.  Chicken Picatta.  Pasta dishes.  There is salmon prepared in no less than 5 different ways, Lox, smoked, poached with dill spinach and cheese, cured and peppered.  Smoked bluefish.  Chilled muscles.  Peel and eat shrimp.  Etc, etc, etc.  Impressive.  A couple of things surprised me, including puddled wet plates, undercooked scrambled eggs (just the way I like them) and buttered poppy seed rolls in the buffet trays, but I didn't care.  Perhaps it was the bourbon talking, but damn, this is an amazing brunch.  If i were there to celebrate my 50th Birthday, I would reserve a table for 8 of my closest friends in the Gandy Dancer Saloon.  It's closer to the donut machine, and the professional bartender who understands what great service means.  Indulge."}
{"text":"We went for Thanksgiving dinner tonight. The food was quite mundane. I think the grand concourse has seen its day. David was a wonderful server and we tipped him well. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Last Thursday night was our second pricey dinner here, and for the second time we were let down by the entrees.  Pyramid of boring rice aside, my salmon rockefeller entrée was OK.  Husband's filet mignon had good flavor, but the meat was overcooked and mangled, like a dog had gotten to it first.  Very soon after our entrees were brought to the table an employee interrupted to ask my guy to cut into his filet.  That surprised me; I thought that request was limited to places like Ponderosa.  A first for me at a higher-end restaurant.  Turns out the filet was overcooked, but my husband declined the offer to have his entrée re-cooked.  Re-cooking is an appreciated offer but never seems very feasible.  What, am I supposed to finish my dinner while we wait for the kitchen to re-cook his?  Our server was nice but seemed too casual and quirky for the atmosphere.  And then the butter incident.  When she brought the bread basket the butter fell off the platter and somehow hit both my heel and my husband's loafer on the way down.  Totally unlucky and unfortunate.  We made light of the situation at the time, but reflecting on it after dinner we were bothered that the SNAFU wasn't handled more professionally.  The server's reaction was to drop to her hands and knees for what felt like a long time, talking loudly about it and dabbing awkwardly at our shoes, drawing attention.  A quick apology and some club soda and fresh linens to clean up on our own would have been a better and more professional reaction.  As negative as this review seems, there were positives too.  The complimentary bread basket and lobster bisque were as good as I remembered.  More positivity:  pre-dinner we enjoyed some appetizers (loved the $1 oysters) and drinks at the bar's happy hour, which was extraordinary as usual.  The on-site bar, Gandy Dancer, truly has one of my all-time favorite happy hours.  The views--husband across the table and city and water views out the window--were beautiful.  I wish Grand Concourse would up its entrée game and offer patrons a more well-rounded, worth-the-money experience.  So far the entrees have been consistently disappointing.  I'm not sure there will be a third time."}
{"text":"I am giving this place 2 stars because the valet guy deserves 5 stars, and the atmosphere was pretty fantastic.  But, it seems that they are heavily dependent on the history of their space, and the decor to bring people in.  The server was very sweet, but definitely did not know what she was doing. We did most of the up-selling for her, and she was confused.  The food was terrible!  I rarely cook at home, and I would say this is the worst meal I have ever had in any caliber of restaurant.  We also watched the kitchen staff walk through, swearing, and complaining every time while in the dining room.  They sent out the banquet manager, who didn't seem to care because it isn't her realm.  Overall, I would never go back, and I would never send a friend here."}
{"text":"This old train station was impressively converted into a beautiful, upscale restaurant with an amazing view of the river.  I had a week day lunch overlooking the river.  The food and view were worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Classic atmosphere. Pittsburgh can feel like New York? Well, thank God for that."}
{"text":"I've only been there for Sunday brunch (many times), so I can't speak for their lunch or dinner, but this is by far the best brunch in Pittsburgh.  It is a little on the expensive side ($26.95 per person), but the large variety they have makes the price worth it!  From every breakfast food you could imagine (made to order pancakes, waffles, and omlettes) to the tastiest prime rib & seafood, to the amazing desserts!...this place has it all!  However, you MUST save room for banana's foster, and of course a fresh donut that you can grab right out of the donut machine.  Tip: if you want a mimosa ($4), they don't start serving them until 11am.  One downfall:  they really cram you in there.  The tables are way too close together with limited room to move, and not much privacy for conversation."}
{"text":"March 5th, Sunday Brunch with my family celebrating two birthdays.  Well worth the money all the way.  Beautiful location, wonderful tasty food choices with great service.  Make an early reservation.  You will not be rushed out for another sitting, enjoy the food at a leisurely pace."}
{"text":"2 visits in the last two weeks yo the Sunday Buffet. 1st class. Loved the selection and the hot donuts !   Worth the 90 minute drive. Be sure to call ahead for reservations. They will be full"}
{"text":"Had an excellent dinner with old friends on a busy Friday night.   Frankly, this would be a five-star review except for the wait--first to be seated, then to give orders, then to be served...But the food was excellent, from the Fisherman's Stew to Snapper Milanese and Sole Milanese and Seafood Pasta, all the flavors were well-melded.  Serving sizes were generous, but not overwhelming.  Wine list was good, not too expensive--we enjoyed a Columbia River Malbec and a Tempranillo, along with a lot of good conversation.   Finished up with Key Lime Pie, Mango Sorbet, and photos on the Grand Staircase of this historic structure repurposed from train station to shopping gallery and fine restaurant."}
{"text":"We LOVE The Grand Concourse Brunch on Sunday's. We went last week and we are going AGAIN today!! The host, and the waitress Kathy were incredible. The host was so kind and he took our picture by tree.  The food was AMAZING!! I loved the mussels,the perfect prime rib, and the various kinds of salmon. The Bananas Foster was beyond belief!! Also we enjoyed the homemade doughnuts.  The drinks are great too. I don't know which kind of Bloody Mary that I like best.  The Grand Concourse is my favorite brunch place in Pittsburgh. There is no competition!! Thanks to a terrific staff of people that work hard."}
{"text":"I've been to the Grand Concourse for lunch a few times, and the food has always been delicious, the wait staff great, and the setting is breathtaking- an old train station with stained glass windows and elegant tables and fixtures. You have to go there at least once as a Pittsburgher.  However, the real reason I love the Grand Concourse is their Sunday brunch buffet. It's ridiculous- rooms and rooms of delicious foods, literally a feast to end all feasts. Omelet bar, pancakes, waffles, and French toast made in front of you, a carving station, every kind of breakfast food you could dream of, pastries on pastries, and so much more. Everything tastes amazing, and you will not go hungry or want of food- you might even get some exercise walking from room to room to find all of the different choices. They even have a kids are with lower tables with kid friendly food like peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.  If you live in Pittsburgh and like a big breakfast, you can't miss the brunch at Grand Concourse!"}
{"text":"For the money not a great value,  As the rating says \"Meh, I've experienced better\"  Had the following:  Appetizer: Rare tuna which was sliced too thin.  It was rare but the sauce was lacking and unimaginative.  Basically soy sauce and for 12.00 it was not a great deal, Due to slicing it was too cool and was reminiscent of sushi but cooked a bit.  Quality of tuna was OK.  Fillet of sole with lump crabmeat. $26 The Crab meat \"was\" Lump.  The fillet had too much egg wash batter which came through as an egg flavor on the dish.  Fish was cooked correctly, done but very moist.  Lump crab was highlight of dish.  Had a butter sauce which was decent and did not overwhelm the dish (or the egg flavor) Came with a few steamed vegetables which were cold by the time I started on fish.  About every 5 minutes just as they choreographed in \"team\" meetings,  Waiter, manager, sou chef, came to table to ask if food was great,  It was not but, it was not a battle I'd care to fight over dinner.  I was there for a business diner so it was quite enough for talking although it was also not close to full on a Thursday night.  Over all I give restaurant 2 stars due to the price of the food.  I felt it was barely above a decent diner quality(average) at high end prices.    They did have the stained glass windows everyone raves about but, I go to restaurants for food 1st, service 2nd and scenery 3rd.    No one complains about the view at a restaurant with great food but, they do seem to rant about a restaurant with a great view and average food.  Grand Concourse is in the second category.  Great scenery, average food, high price."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food. Seafood well prepared. Wonderful Cowboy Ribeye. Tasty salads."}
{"text":"Food was delicious but the service was very poor. Don't go unless you have a very long time to wait. Our table of 4 waited for 40+ minutes for our food. At one point, after waiting about 10 minutes with an empty water glass, I got up and retrieved the water pitcher myself to fill my glass. Service was slow from beginning all the way through to paying the check. To clarify, this was on a Wednesday evening at 6:30 and there was a very very minimal crowd, most all of the visible tables were empty. I won't return."}
{"text":"I have been to the Grand Concourse on several occasions for Sunday brunch and once for Dinner.  The facility is an old train station and is beautiful on the inside.  The Sunday brunch is absolutely spectacular.    Sunday brunch features nearly every option you could imagine from prime rib to freshly made donuts.  The first time you go, take a lap before getting a plate, there are so many options you will want to get a lay of the land first so you don't miss out on anything.  The place is always packed and the atmosphere is great.  Brunch is worth every penny.   The one time I went for dinner it was good but not to the level of the brunch.  I felt the dinner menu was slightly over priced, but the service was top notch.  I ordered the encrusted tuna (rare), it was cooked properly and was very flavorful.    Overall, I gave it a 4 out of 5 stars because my dinner experience there was a bit of a letdown, that however might be attributed to the massive expectations I had for it based off the brunch.  Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to Sunday Brunch, you will not regret it."}
{"text":"Once  a year the wife and I go out and eat an expensive meal.  I lived in the Burgh for 21 years and never went to this place.  Figured we ask for a table with a view of the city and it did not disappoint.  The Smithfield Street bridge at night is awesome to look at.  My dish the salmon was ok...i kind of expected better but the wife's sea bass she said was outstanding.  All in all its has a good atmosphere and good food.  But I have had a better meal and spent less."}
{"text":"Cold food... worst service.... they forgot about us and never followed up once they sat us down (no water... no napkins.....no food... no contact).... there was chewed up gum left on a used napkin left in our both...(made us wonder how clean the table really was)...  Worst server ever... Server was allover the place and making constant excuses ..  we asked for water... she never brought it... we asked for coffe and she brought us cold ice tea in coffee cups...whuttt?  she kept complaining ... took her for ever to bring the expensive bill (given the quality of the food and deplorable service) . HONESTLY SHE WAS DISHEVELED AND WE SUSPECTED SHE WAS HIGH...  Total rip off... we were bummed!   I have Never left negative feedback before,  but this was unreal... we travel a lot and enjoy nice dining experiences...and we will pay for good food and great service... DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE."}
{"text":"If you're considering booking an event with the Grand Concourse, I highly recommend it. They are wonderful to work with and the staff is always more than attentive during our events. The food is always delicious!"}
{"text":"It's truly never a good sign when the best service you receive comes from the valet. I wish I was joking. We have been a few times for brunch and it is normally fantastic. We decided to go for restaurant week summer 2014 based on the menu. We arrived at 7 for our reservation at 7:15 and were seated by a window for a beautiful view of the city. The host was very friendly and informed us that our server Colleen would be with us shortly. Colleen arrived and took our drink orders. Awhile later she returned with our drinks and to take our orders. Now, I'm not sure if she thought her check average would be low because we ordered the restaurant week specials or what, but everything went downhill from here. Our salads arrived and Chris and I both finished our drinks before our salads. Colleen did not return to ask if we would like another drink for at least 25 minutes. We sat with empty glasses and cleaned plates for a long time. Now, there were two other tables in front of us that she was waiting on. She would come out, check on the couple who was celebrating their anniversary, and then return to the kitchen. Then come back, drop off what they needed and then go back to the kitchen. Then come out, check on the table directly in front of ours, and return to the kitchen. Come out, deliver what they needed, and back to the kitchen. I kept trying to catch her eye but would have had to dance on the table to be noticed I think. She finally returned to clear plates and ask if we needed other drinks, which we did. Our meals were delivered by a manager, I can only imagine they had been under the heat lamp forever before someone got fed up enough to deliver them. I had the salmon, Chris had the shrimp fresco, and my mother had the short ribs. They really enjoyed their meals. My salmon was dried out from being under the heat lamps for too long and the sauce was very sweet. I only finished half of it and again we sat for the longest time with no acknowledgment or plate clearing whatsoever! Colleen finally returned and cleared our plates. Dessert was finally delivered and the chocolate mousse and the bananas foster creme brûlée were very good. Again we finished and sat with empty plates for forever. I finally ventured to the restroom to discover the Colleen was too busy flirting with a bartender at a table behind the grand piano and laughing and hair tossing with another server and what I can only assume was a manager based on her street clothes. I went to the restroom and returned and she was still there.  I got back to our table and five minutes later she decided to return to ask if we were ready for our check. All in all our dinner of three courses took an hour and 45 minutes. Now I'm all for taking my time for dinner, so long as someone will stop by to refill Chris's water glass and bring more wine or cocktails. But if you intend to ignore us and decrease your check average, then you can also expect to get a subpar tip. Sadly the food was good with the exception of the salmon, and I'm sure the chef didn't intend for it to sit under a heat lamp forever.  All in all, Chris had said we will not return, even for brunch. It's sad because it is a gorgeous setting and the food is actually good but the service was so disappointing that I doubt we will return. A sidenote, when we went to pick up my car from the valet he RAN to get our car. Seriously RAN. And opened my door for me. He received a 100% tip for being the best service we had that night."}
{"text":"What a beautiful place this is! We come here once every couple years for brunch. It's always very good ( especially the salmon ). Well every thing is pretty good. Yesterday I had salmon, ribs, salad, Mac and cheese, apple turnover.  I only wish I had a bigger stomach and was able to eat more. While nothing was \"out of this world\" the choices you have are very nice and everything was really good. I just really enjoy the architecture here and the grandness of the whole place. I would give it 5 stars if out server had brought us some water a little sooner and our plates were cleared in between servings. It's buffet so they should be on top of the only thing they have to do. Overall very good"}
{"text":"I'm not inclined to waste time crafting a cleverly worded review for such a subpar experience, so I'll just bullet point it out after a little background.   I remember going to the GC as a kid/teenager for special events that called for a special, grand space and fancy food. The GC back then did an admirable job of accomplishing that. The main dining room (once the passenger terminal for the old PA and Lake Erie RR) is a spectacular, inspiring environment, and the food, if a bit stuffy, was well executed and fresh.The other night was a sad reminder that things change, often not for the better. Thusly:  1. Upon being seated a member of our party found a bunch of dirty cloth napkins _underneath_ the table. After asking the hostess what we should do with them we were met with something along the lines of \"Well, I can't reach them so what would you like me to do?\". This resulted in said party member handing the soiled linen to said hostess and quickly excusing herself to disinfect her hands.   2. We ordered a bottle of wine and the clearly inexperienced server didn't pour an even volume into all of glasses to the members of our party who were partaking. When we politely asked about this he said that if there's not an equal volume for the final glass then there's just not an equal volume for the final glass. As this is total hogwash we asked to speak to a manager who came over and provided a replacement glass of wine.   3. After the \"wine incident\" the waiter was visibly passive aggressive in his interactions with the table. It went so far as that when he'd walk away from our table, members of our party could see him shaking his head on multiple occasions. We were nothing but civilized following his mistake and this was obviously an amateur and immature reaction to not owning up to a simple mistake.  4. I had the salmon Rockefeller. It was barely edible. The fish was cooked dry and was not hot. I take that back, it was at precisely the temperature that a piece of fish would be at after sitting under a heating lamp for 45 minutes. Similarly, the bernaise sauce was congealed and the spinach and crab stuffing had little crap and a lot of watery spinach. The caesar salad contained precisely 1 piece of anchovy.   5. We ordered dessert and coffee. The member of our party who ordered an Irish coffee was forgotten. When we asked after 15min for the item it arrived in less than a minute, cold, and with obviously canned whipped cream oozing down the side of the glass. Oh yeah, and no spoon.  6. I ordered a beer. Despite the extensive wine list the GC has Coors Light on tap along with some other shitty beers and a couple of Sam Adams. I get they're not a gastropub or anything but there should be a little bit more attention to having one or two quality beers on draft.  In summary, for about $40/person you can be sassed and served bad food in a delightful old building. It's a shame the GC has fallen so low. They need Gordon Ramsay to come in and knock some heads around because whatever they're doing these days is simply embarrassing."}
{"text":"Mediocre food that they charge an arm and a leg for because you get a good view of the city while you eat. Look, there's LOTS of places in Pittsburgh where you get a great view of the city. Driving in through the Liberty Tunnel. A couple of cheap seats at a Pirates game. The Duquesne Incline. Walking across a bridge. Why, oh why, would you pay top dollar for basically cafeteria food just because the place is \"fancy\"?"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place.  The food is fairly standard, but the fish is fresh.  It gets low marks for amount of food vs. price though.  Of course, just being in this restaurant sort of makes me forget the food a bit.  I do wish that in such a large restaurant they could have seated us away from other diners for a bit more privacy.  The manager came by and was very nice and gave us interesting information about the renovations and specifics about what we were looking out.  I would recommend it as a special occasion or a must-dine venue for anyone interested in dining in a beautiful space.  There bar is also beautiful and a more quiet option for romance or nice talks with your sweetie."}
{"text":"Had the combo with salmon, crab cake, and macadamia coconut shrimp. Excellent.  Caesar salad was very good. Service was poor once I got my dinner.  Never saw my waitress again until someone else brought me my bill. Double points on Mondays."}
{"text":"If you're a fan of brunch (and let's face it, who isn't?!) you must try the Sunday brunch at the Grand Concourse.  Not only does it have the incredible architecture and ambiance, but the food is scrumptious!  If you leave still feeling hungry, it's your own fault.  I'm a sucker for historical venues and the Grand Concourse is just that.  Chandeliers and staircases that make your jaw drop in awe.  With your jaw hanging open, you feel the urge to stuff it with the delicious food surrounding you.  Of course there are the staples - eggs, bacon, hash browns... but when's the last time you had Bananas Foster for breakfast?  A carving station with roast and ham for the carnivore connoisseurs, and the best donuts I have ever had.  Repeat:  BEST. DONUT. EVER!  These donuts are made from an old time-y donut making machine.  Once cooked, you can cover them in powdered sugar or cinnamon sugar (my personal favorite).  In fact, I would go to the Grand Concourse simply for the donuts.  There are kid stations with chicken fingers and dirt pudding - for actual kids and the grown up kind.  Want lox and bagels?  Help yourself!  Waffles with strawberries and whipped cream?  Dive on in.    For those looking to experience one of the best brunches in the Burgh, the Grand Concourse should be number one on the list."}
{"text":"Best Sunday Brunch in the city.  We love the Sunday Brunch here.  The food is top notch and the staff is always polite.  We have also gone for dinner a few times.  The grand concourse is not cheap but the ambiance alone is worth it.  We like the place so much we got married here, which worked out great for pictures."}
{"text":"Grand Concourse is the perfect name for this establishment.  Grand is the word.  The food was wonderful.  We went after a Pittsburgh Pirate game ( wonderful ferry ride from the park to this mall area) and found this restaurant.  Pricey, but worth it!  Part of the Landry restauants.  Seafood heaven.  Beautiful old building and great views of the water!  Highly recommend if in area..."}
{"text":"I had fun, it's a beautiful place.  The service was really good and I love buffet dining.  Here's the thing.  The food ranged from bad to just ok.  I am there for the food.  There are a couple reviews about this restaurant that exclaim that it's the best buffet ever.  I should have really ignored them and focused on all the more critical reviews on this restaurant as they really rang true.  Normally when the reviews are this mixed I stay far away.    I don't know where to begin.  How about the omelet station.  It takes a tremendous amount of skill to make a good omelet on a flat top.  It just isn't done this way.  You have to spread out a lot of egg and quickly fold it onto itself to give it any depth.  If you leave it flat, it's done before you can warm any ingredients or melt any cheese.  I watched rubbery brown thin wrappers of egg surround cold and bland ingredients flow from a well meaning omelet station attendant.  How could you?   I didn't realize it until later but if you're looking for the french toast, it's hidden in back of the omelet station in a hotel pan.  I never did find it until we were on our way out the door.    The best 2 things about this brunch were the automatic donut machine and the bagels.  Neither of which this place makes on their own.  In fact, I noted quite a few things they don't actually prepare here at all.    The meat carving station looked nice and I chose the Gobi Dessert of pork loins.  It isn't 1950 and you don't have to cook pork within an inch of it's life anymore.  There wasn't anyone in the kitchen today that knows how lean a cut this is and how if you're going to put it out on a carving station it should be cooked til slightly pink in the center.   The desert station isn't worth my time to talk about.  There isn't a real pastry chef there and the cookies were clearly out of a box.  The chocolate cake tasted like Duncan Hines with the frosting that you get out of a can.  Another sad and depressing effort here in the Burgh.  Sigh."}
{"text":"It's a treat eating at the Grand Concourse, especially the Sunday Brunch. The food is not trendy it is simply good: excellent quality,  classic preparation. The brunch offerings wind their way through the stunning architecture of a 1901 train station allowing diners to stroll through pure elegance. Perfect salmon, delicious cheeses, salads, sautéed veggies, omelettes. And I always save room for the waffles."}
{"text":"What's the point of a reservation if I still have to wait 30 minutes?!? The brunch lacks order and the staff is mediocre in managing the crowds of those with reservations versus walk-ins. Could have found better things to do with my time."}
{"text":"Our waitress was so sweet, but I've gotten better steak at a chain restaurant.  For the price, it should have made my mouth water! I asked for medium and it was well done, it just honestly was very underwhelming.  It wasn't \"bad\"... just not worth it.  And the portions are tiny!"}
{"text":"As the group planner in my circle of friends, I called ahead to let the Grand Concourse know I needed a large round table for a party of 12 since we're coming here to celebrate a friend's birthday dinner. They arranged it without a problem.  When we arrived at this once train station but now grandiose restaurant, our host brought us to a round table with a little reserved sign on it near the live pianist. The ambiance could not be better. The first sign that the restaurant showed initiative was when we realized that underneath the reserved sign on our table was a note that allowed us to choose two complimentary appetizers to start our night. WOW! What a nice surprise! We began with plates of calamari for the table. Then came the bread and this amazing salmon butter that we could not get enough of. We barely had room for the entrees when they arrived!  The order of fish was done just the way we wanted and the restaurant timed the entrance of every part of our meal perfectly, including the arrival of the cake at the end of it all. I can't say enough how accommodating this place was and it really made it a great birthday not just for my friend but for everyone else who ate there as well."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to have a Thanksgiving feast. Their turkey was quite good. The stuffing selections were really tasty, especially the one with the hazelnuts in it. The only negative thing to say about this experience is the cheese plate offerings. It was very limited. It was basic. There were no brie's there, no exotic cheeses. Just the regular swiss, cheddar, marbles colby (I think), and maybe, just maybe a blue cheese, but I really can't remember, so it was not likely offered - I spent very little time there. Would I go back again? Certainly. The building itself is worth a visit. Some of the wait staff have been there for over 30 years, so the service is excellent. I can and do recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great brunch. Reservations are needed though, and well in advance if you are a large party. I did have to call twice to make a reservation because after the first call, they said they would cal back and never did. That could be improved, the same as service."}
{"text":"I had dinner here while waiting for my boyfriend to finish up at an event.  I sat at the bar (naturally) and ordered a drink while I looked over the menu. Ended up ordering the crab spinach dip and the prime rib (rare to medium rare). The back of the menu gave a history of the building which was a nice read, informative..  It did seem like I waited a long time for the crab dip to come out...probably just because I was alone. The dip came with house made chips with some sort of sweet seasoning on them which I didn't like so the bartender kindly brought me some flatbread crackers.  He notified me the prime rib is ready to go so just let him know when I'm ready for it. I appreciated that as I don't prefer to be rushed.   The prime rib was delicious and huge for only $27. Once my boyfriend and his friends arrived they finished off my leftovers.   Overall extremely pleased with the service and the quality of the food, it is definitely a beautiful space."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh.  Absolutely beautiful inside with amazing service and food.  My fiance and I went here for his birthday a two days after Christmas.  Our service was prompt and our server was well versed on the menu and wine choices.  We had a delicious bottle of white that was on the seasonal menu.  It came with a half order of raw oysters that were incredible!  I had the goat and blue cheese salad with the Sherry Vinaigrette.  Our server actually modified the dressing because she felt it was too tart...and it was delicious!  My fiance had the salad with warm bacon dressing which was amazing as well.  I had the duck that had an orange glaze and came with sweet potato vanilla bean mashed potatoes...AMAZING!!!  This was the first time I had duck and it was cooked perfectly.  My fiance had the salmon with jasmine rice which was ok.  He said my meal was better than his and after trying his I agree.  It wasn't bad, it just wasn't the best salmon either one of us had ever had.  For desert our server suggested this delicious apple pie/tart with a shortbread crust and cinnamon ice cream.  It wasn't on the menu but she told us about it because its so good...and let me tell you...it was!  Overall, it was a wonderful meal.  One of the best I've had for 2012.  Yes, the meal was close to $200 (with tax and tip)...but we were there for almost three hours and everything was an experience!  We will definitely be back again...I mean not every weekend because we couldn't afford it...but for a special occasion this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"This place is beautiful on the inside. I ordered one of the specials of the night. It was plank cooked salmon with asparagus and potatoes. The best seafood dish I've ever had in Pittsburgh. Coming from Boston it's been hard to deal with the reality that there's just not as great of a seafood choice here. This dish made me happy again."}
{"text":"Really good scallops and gnocchi. A little over salted. Skip the chain restaurants in Station Square and pay only slightly more for a much better meal!"}
{"text":"Amazing room. A must see in Pittsburgh. Seafood dishes were stellar. Loved it all except like much of Pittsburgh hospitality, waitstaff and bartender seemed unhappy, uncaring and insincere.  (Thus the four stars) I don't get it. I think it's Pittsburgh in general? Service is the B team. Nevertheless, this place was fantastic tonite."}
{"text":"The Grand Concourse Restaurant is a place most proud Pittsburghers know and frequent for special occasions. As their website boasts, most Pittsburghers find this destination of fine dining to be \"unmatched in grandeur\". I would, for the most part, agree. This grand historical building and the glamorous décor details create an amazing fine dining ambiance. Although I am very grateful, and consider myself lucky to be treated to a dinner here, I was slightly disappointed in some aspects of the food.  My Valentine booked us for an 8:30 reservation on the Saturday post-holiday. Even though we arrived 10 minutes early, we still had to wait about 15 mins past our reservation time for our table. This wait was  disappointing, but allowed me to decide what to order from the vast Dinner menu. While waiting, a very upset customer complained to the maitre'd that his table's meal arrived cold 45 minutes after ordering. As we walked to our table the main dining room appeared full, but the waterfront area was only half seated.  To start we received delicious, warm buttery bread rolls and crackers paired with a rich smoked salmon pate spread. I ordered a lobster bisque and my BF ordered a Seasonal Goat Cheese Salad of strawberries, candied pecans, poppy seeds, with white balsamic and a warm goat cheese crouton.  My thoughts that the kitchen was behind and understaffed, were confirmed as my soup did not arrive until about 10 minutes after my BF's salad did. I did not enjoy the soup. It was very one-noted with only the taste of creamy lobster stock. But somehow still with only a tiny about of actual lobster in it. I craved seasoning, green onions, vegetables, or really anything at all to break up the single boring thick lobster stock element.  Overall, my main dish did not disappoint. I ordered the Ultimate Seafood Mixed Trio of  grilled salmon, crab cake and coconut macadamia shrimp. I enjoyed all three. The salmon and crab cake were of great quality, moist, and cooked well. The coconut shrimp were flavorful, crispy and not at all greasy. The sides on the other hand were lack luster. I selected the side of parmesan risotto to go with it, but was not impressed. It just seems like cheesy rice to me. The kind sold as a rice side from the grocery store, in the cardboard box with the special seasoning package. I usually LOVE a flavorful cheese-based risotto, so I was disappointed. I had ordered asparagus, but was given broccoli. It came in this huge chunk, without the leaves even removed. Seemed an odd, no-effort-required way to serve broccoli. At a fine dining place I expect more. All they did was chop a huge chunk off the bushel and steam it. I didn't bother to even try it. When I go out to eat I want to have food that I couldn't have prepared myself. I put more effort into preparing my broccoli at home.  My boyfriend enjoyed his Filet Mignon prepared with maître d'butter. He did note it didn't seem to match the price, compared to other exception filet experiences he'd had elsewhere. Again the sides of reggiano potato croquettes, asparagus did not live up to much. The \"potato croquettes\" actually just seemed like dollops of bland mashed potato that had been fried to achieve a crispy outer shell. Again seemed to be lacking unique flavor to make this side truly enjoyable and delicious.   Our final choice of the evening was the Bananas Foster Creme Brulee. While beautifully presented, totally \"Instagram-able\" and overall enjoyable, I again think there was a missed opportunity to make this dish truly delicious. When the title of the dish says \"Bananas Fosters\" I expect the bananas to be caramelized! They were served raw on top of the creme brulee. I LOVE warm, sweet, melt in your mouth caramelized bananas and was truly shocked and disappointed with that lackluster aspect of this dessert. Overall we had an okay trip to the Grand Concourse Restaurant and I really am lucky to be treated to a meal at a fine dining establishment. The atmosphere is very picturesque and interesting with charming notes to history everywhere you look. Our service was friendly and professional. Our meals we're of good quality overall, just lacking in flavor and that extra deliciousness that I crave when I'm going out for a fine-dining meal. Maybe the cuisine is intentionally basic. During each course I wanted more. More dimensions of taste & seasoning. This is sounding like the harshest I've ever been on a restaurant I've written about. I however don't think I am being very subjectively opinionated. These critiques are just the truth from my objective experience. I'm not an expert food critic, nor a food photographer, just sharing my experience in comparison to other fine dining experiences I've also shared on my blog. It's still a given that every Pittsburgher should experience the atmosphere of the iconic Grand Concourse for themselves, just like we all should indulge in a Primanti's sandwich."}
{"text":"Had a business dinner and had a nice round of finger foods to great us. Had the crab cakes for dinner (a little dry) and a delicious key lime pie for desert.  The mashed potatoes were amazing.  I wasn't paying so the price was right. Great interior views of a stained glass roof."}
{"text":"I went here twice for brunch and had a great experience both times.  If you want a nice TRUE brunch in Pittsburgh, this is the place to go.  Great food, awesome drinks, and a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"After hearing and reading several positive comments about food allergies and brunch at the Grand Concourse we decided to give it a go with our family. I noted in our reservations via OpenTable we had several food allergies and would like to know what to avoid, other than obvious things like peanut butter. I also called the day before to confirm what their protocol was, as most reviews mentioned a chef will come out and walk the buffet line and point out items that are safe and not safe to eat for your specific allergies (we have peanut, tree nut, and sesame).  Chef Phil enthusiastically walked our family around and spoke directly and excitedly to our child. There were many safe options for our family, including the waffles and ice cream! (Which our child very much enjoyed!) The kids had no trouble finding foods each of them liked beyond what was offered in the kids section (chicken fingers, tater tots etc.)  Appreciated that our server waited to refill our coffee cups when we were at the table instead while we were away visiting the buffet. Thumbs up from the younger diners this round, as well as from Mom and Dad."}
{"text":"Wow, what a fantastic place. The ambiance of this place is second to none. It is situated in an historic train station which has beautiful architecture! The food took a while to be served but it was well worth the wait! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I've had nothing but good experiences here...two great dinner dates and three great trips to the awesome Buffett brunch which I dream about sometimes. The service is always top notch. The dynamite scallops are out of this world. Can't wait to return. Oh, and the place is just beautiful and great views of the river."}
{"text":"Amazing sea food. The interior design is wonderful. It is a great restaurant for special occasions."}
{"text":"I was told this is the place to go in PIttsburgh for an event-style dinner.  A dear friend was leaving town, so we made a special night of it.  Based on some of the mediocre reviews I was half-expecting to be fully disappointed.  Whether or not due to the limited expectations, I must say I was thoroughly impressed!  For starters, the view from that area is truly yummy.  On a warm night, walking anywhere around Station Square offers great views of the city...  but given that it was particularly chilly, the cozy restaurant atmosphere combined with the beautiful view was particularly appreciated.  As for the food, again, I had low expectations.  Most fancy restaurants I've been to offer tiny portions and a lot of puffed up descriptions that don't usually do much for me.  Glad to say however, we were both rather pleased with our dishes.  I don't even remember what exactly we ordered-- but suffice to say it was some kind of seafood drenched in awesome-sauce.  Overall it was a great evening.  The service was good, food was great, and we couldn't get enough of the view.  I'd definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch just can't get much better than this. A wide selection of whatever you could possibly want, priced very well for the quality, and an attentive staff that knows what they're doing! The banana foster are always a great topper with coffee when you're finishing  up. Excellent and consistent!"}
{"text":"I would give 4 1/2, but I won't punish the whole review for a couple bad apples...      We didn't have a reservation for brunch, so we were seated on the bar side. Same brunch, same everything, you're just not in the room with the vaulted ceilings and better decor. The hostess was very nice, brought us to our table, and introduced us to our server, Jamie. He was very nice and helpful and took us for a tour of all the stations: Donut Station - a machine constantly makes fresh donuts and drops them into a bowl, then you take a donut and drop them into cinnamon or powdered sugar...OR BOTH! Freaking awesome! Omelette Station: eggs the way you like them, unless you try to change something. Ordered a veggie omelette and western omelette subbing mushrooms for peppers. Veggie had ham and the Western had everything and the mushrooms. Not to mention the guy serving them was not happy. It may have been all the opposing team's gear in the room...(this is where they lost a half star) Dessert Station - Bananas Foster Station: Apple Dumpling...WOW, cinnamon sticky bun...great, ice cream and strawberries and chocolate chips and waffle to put on everything. Breakfast buffet - Typical, but no turkey bacon or turkey sausage. They have turkey that they slice to order, and prime rib, and ham...peel to eat shrimp, mussels, pasta...freaking RIDICULOUS!!!       The food was all delicious and worth the $27.99 price tag...oh, and awesome Bloody Mary's and coffee! (BM's not included in price)"}
{"text":"Enjoyed brunch. Only thing that lowered the rating is that they saw we had two elderly people with us, one 83 and one 93 and they sat us in the outside room which made the buffet a far distance. Poor decision making"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a fine meal here one night when I was in Pittsburgh on business.  The building is a beautiful old train station.  Also the food was very delicious.  The only complant would be the fact that we had to wait ~25 minutes for a table.  But when we were seated there was only half the restaurant full.  Anyways I am glad that we waited for the table.  Give this place a try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Came here with the whitest people I know aka my girlfriend's family for her grandfather's 90th birthday dinner which, for a 90 year old, started at 1:00 p.m. Luckily, they let us order from the dinner menu. The food was good, but the drinks... I tell you, I needed a drink or 3 to get through this. The espresso martini definitely provided a great social lubricant for what could have been a sequel to the movie \"12 Angry Men\" called \"21 Waspy People\". The decor and history definitely made a potentially awkward gathering less so ( long story short it was a train station covered with tar during WWII to hide from enemies and many years later was rediscovered as this beautiful stained glassed piece of history which was then converted into a restaurant).  This is the perfect place to have awkward encounters over good food. If ever there is a lull in the conversation, just point at the stained glass ceiling and say \"Well, would you look at that...\" Then quickly order a drink and shove some quality seafood in you mouth."}
{"text":"Good, consistent restaurant in Station Square.  I've been going here since I was extremely young and have always found something great to eat.  The interior is beautiful too - it's old train station converted into a restaurant and bar.  This makes for an excellent trivia bit if you happen to be with out-of-towners.    By the way, my favorite dish: Linguine with red clam sauce.  The pasta is always fresh and homemade, and I always leave dinner satisfied."}
{"text":".. The classic Americana of the train station turned bistro in all of its retro glory,  with the food befitting the beautiful architecture. We chose the Tempura Lobster Fritters, cooked like conch fritters in the islands,  done over and with a savory soy and rice noodles. FAB!   It's easy to get scallops wrong, but they get them right, also off the summer menu with salmon and a mashed seasoned potato blend. Also fab, glad our server was able to dissuade me away from the standard Surf & Turf.   Wonderful views at river level of the night Pittsburgh male for a cozy, quiet date. Go ahead and grab this train, your taste buds will love the destination.."}
{"text":"What a cool place for a restaurant.  The building was interesting, food excellent and the service attentive.  Make sure you bring your camera."}
{"text":"Sorry for the low rating, but this is based on two separate visits, about six months apart...  Came here with work colleagues for lunch each time... Each time our lunches took 40 minutes to arrive at the table after ordering. For lunch! The fish and chips is good, but I really prefer a faster turnaround on a weekday lunch order.  Three stars, because if I do go back here, it will be for dinner. 40 minutes doesn't seem so long if there's a bottle of wine at the table..."}
{"text":"We called to set up a reservation -- not once, but twice (once, on the same day)-- to check on being seated in the grand room with the piano.  It was to be a celebration since I'd passed the exam I'd studied for for 1 year and 7 months. The Grand Concourse has always been my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh because of the gorgeous main room, and because the food is so delicious. Not true anymore!   Upon arrival, we found out that they were having a huge party in the grand room, and the hostess hadn't bothered to tell us that we couldn't enjoy the opulent main room, but could only be seated in the dark, loud bar, or in the equally-loud room by the bridge/river. We chose the room by the river where we faced the steel bridge. Since the main room is part of the experience, this was like being offered an elegant dinner on a yacht, and instead, being fed KFC on a dinghy.   We arrived too late for the early bird, and couldn't get our usual of Rainbow trout. That's okay. We were flexible. We ordered a few salads (the Martha's Vineyard salad with blue cheese and pine nuts dressed with raspberry vinaigrette is very good!), and their infamous lobster and sherry (which was just okay -- not much of a sherry taste). The warm bread with fish pate and butter was really delicious, too.  You can order the fish grilled, blackened, baked, or broiled, and, they have options -- for an additional $7.99 -- of topping them with crab or lobster. But, we just wanted good simple fresh fish. What a mistake!  My father and partner had sole and I had Mahi Mahi grilled, while my mother had the lemon chicken. Do you know that every single dish lacked flavor, salt, pepper, and lemon?!  No lemon on the plates. Weird!  The food was as bland as could be! Though, the vegetables were alternately mush or undercooked, and completely over-salted.  For dessert, we ordered a hot fudge molten lava cake with vanilla ice cream, which was fine (not super chocolate-y), and the bananas foster creme brulee, which in no way resembled a creme brulee. The desserts, bread, and salad were the best part of the meal.  The service was very friendly, and the bill was huge. It was $150 for 4 people, with no wine or other beverages with the meal (other than 2 coffees with dessert), 2 people not ordering salads, and 2 desserts.   Atria's (a local chain) has much better food for the money. And, for the same cost, Monterey Bay Fish Grotto is superb.  I have no doubt that Tom Colicchio would have kicked the Grand Concourse's chef off Top Chef.  I would not return to the Grand Concourse Restaurant nor recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"A historic gem! A restaurant in a former train station filled with stained glass and original wood work. We experienced wonderful dining as a group. Had a salad, the calamari and the snapper Hemingway. Topped that with death by chocolate and officially had to toast to the wonderful waiter Herbert."}
{"text":"Nice place, good food, good service.  The best thing about staying at the Sheraton."}
{"text":"This review is for the Easter Brunch/Dinner. We went here for Thanksgiving and our experience was 5 stars. From the food to the service, everything was on point. However, Easter was a whole new game. We arrived 10 minutes prior to our reservation time, but we weren't seated until 45 minutes after our reservation time. During our wait with a room full of other eager people with reservations, the girl seating the tables, accepts money from a gentleman to be seated earlier. That was just not cool. You want to push a customers reservation to keep people happy, I understand, but accepting money when there is a room FULL of people is unacceptable. The food was average. Maybe my expectations were high after our Thanksgiving experience, but I was disappointed. I don't think we will be back for the Easter Brunch in the future."}
{"text":"A great place for a special occassion brunch! Out-of-towners will be impressed by the views and the interior, and you can take the incline to show off the city afterward.  My husband treated me to Grand Concourse for my birthday, and it was awesome. The interior is beautiful and the view of the river is amazing. The waitstaff was professional and helpful.  The food was delicious and plentiful. My favorite item was the bananas flambe! Soooo great! I also recommend the chicken, carved turkey, omelets, and desserts. It's a perfect combination of a hearty breakfast and lunch.  A reservation is required, and if you want to go on a \"big\" day (Father's Day), contact them far in advance!"}
{"text":"I went here for the Sunday Brunch !  It was really good many choices of items ,  they had different stations for all the many choices!  Belgian Waffles were really good! You name it they had it!  It was a-little  pricey at $30 a person !   That's the only downfall if you don't eat a lot you won't get your moneys worth.  The inside of the restaurant is amazing it used to be a train station!  They service was good."}
{"text":"We came in from out of town for my girl friends birthday. What a amazing experience we had !!! No work can say how unbelievable it was. Are waitress was the best we have ever had. Rebecca was her name. She made us feel like VIP .  Even the shrift manager (tony) took time to come over to are table to check on how are dinner was going since the Bone in Filet came out not cooked  to are liking. After are amazing dinner, Rebecca asked if we would like a quick tour of the building , since there was a wedding on the main seating area. That was so special.  I highly recommend this restaurant to all who reads this !!! Thank You Rebecca for a great dinner experience again !!!!"}
{"text":"Came in a party of 4 for Sunday brunch. Our reservation was for 1:15. We were seated a few minutes lately but it was understandable because the dining room was very busy. Once we were seated Ashley stopped by to introduce herself and explain the layout of the buffet to us. She was fantastic during and after the meal even offering to take our picture. The food was delicious and there were tons of options. The bloody marys were very good as well. We were seated next to a window overlooking the river and downtown. I would recommend asking if one is available. I'll recommend the Grand Concorde brunch to anyone."}
{"text":"We came here for a night out with the family. This place is amazing. It's a high end restaurant so expect to pay for the food and service. We had the seafood and everything on my plate was gone. I would come back here again"}
{"text":"Excellent food, a bit pricey though.  I had there roast duck, which is a seasonal menu item.  It was great, the cranberry sauce that they glazed it with complimented it perfectly.  Our service was not the quickest or the most attentive but I am hoping that it was just our server and not the normal service offered by the restaurant's staff."}
{"text":"I went as a party of 6 for my parent's 40th wedding anniversary dinner.  When I made the reservation weeks before the date, via OpenTable, I mentioned in the \"comments\" box that it was a special night for my parents.  When our server first approached the table he addressed my parents with a \"Happy Anniversary\" and a \"Congratulations.\"  It made them feel special and set the tone for a wonderful evening.   I was a little worried about taking them to the Grand Concourse for a special event because I read the reviews on Yelp and other sites saying that the venue was beautiful, the food was so-so and the service was terrible.  I am 100% happy that we took a chance.  The evening was wonderful.  We were seated in the river view dining area and at first I was disappointed because everyone talked about how beautiful the main dining area was (it was reserved for a wedding).  The river dining room was cozy with a fabulous view of the night city skyline across the river.  Our waiter was friendly, he went above and beyond providing great service for the table.  The food was very good and portions nicely sized.  I will 100% go back and hopefully have a chance to check out the main dining room."}
{"text":"So, I was thinking about stars, how many should I give? After some contemplating, gotta go with a 5.  First of all, they have an amazing wait staff.  Secondly,  they, as other reviewers have said, have it all. If you leave here hungry, shame on you, not them. There truly is something for everyone. Sure they have all the breakfast staples including scrambled eggs, sausage (which is tastefully delicious) and bacon, waffles and pancakes, and don't forget the make your own omelet station. They have homemade donuts And blueberry muffins that have this amazing crumbly top with boatloads of bluebs in them. Wow! Then they have lunch items that range from salmon, smoked salmon, musssels, shrimp cocktail, Mac n cheese (which was my least favorite thing and it was not bad by any means), rice, and a cutting station that includes turkey, roast beef, and ham (the turkey was so succulent, wow). Then there are the desserts, wow! They have mini cheesecakes and brownies and chocolate cake so rich and decadent (it was something to behold and eat, lol), cookies and Apple turnover with a sweet and rich sauce, omg! The drinks...I had a mango bellini which was terrific and my sister had a bloody mary which was delightful as well. They even have kids items including chicken fingers and pb and j sandwiches. If you are visiting Pittsburgh this place should be on your list for their Sunday brunch and it doesn't hurt that you are inside of the old train station which is way cool! :) go, eat, enjoy, and leave stuffed for the rest of the day. :)"}
{"text":"I go here for the Sunday brunch. Very good food, not your average buffet. There is a omelet bar, waffle bar, donut making station, along with normal breakfast items such as bacon eggs sausage and potatoes. Prime rib carving station and shrimp cocktails. A bit pricey at $28 per person but definitely something fun to do on a Sunday every once in a while."}
{"text":"Fabulous!  Came here for brunch with my BF's family. The place is gorgeous inside! Very old and preserved (in a good way). The waitstaff was very friendly and professional, and the food was fantastic. The brunch menu includes bagels, lox, rice, carved meats, eggs, omelets, waffles, hash browns, chicken tenders, candy, desserts, and more! Get there around 11am since it tends to get packed around 12pm and 1 pm.   Was my first but definitely  not my last time to visit the grand concourse!"}
{"text":"I've been told by my coworkers for the longest time how great the Grand Concourse is for Sunday brunch so when my Mother came to visit I figured we would check it out.  We easily made reservations for Sunday morning.  When we arrived, the staff told us they were backed up so we walked near the river, which is a great place to check out some left over machines from the Steel Mill days.     The Grand Concourse is an old train station turned fancy restaurant. Make sure you come hungry because there are so many fantastic options.  The ambiance is amazing with panoramic views of the city.   The building is from the early 1900's so you feel like you are in the 1920's.  As for the food, let's just say it is magnificent and you won't leave hungry.  The staff is constantly changing the food at the buffet so everything is fresh and tasty.  There are so many wonderful options.  The made to order omelets are second to none and the carving station includes top quality meats.   If you're looking for great quality food and awesome ambiance in your dining experience in Pittsburgh, I would absolutely recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've had a group of about forty people for dinner here.  The food was excellent, the waitstaff attentive and skilled, and the price was reasonable.   My guests raved about the dinner.  The ambiance is unique, and the evening wouldn't be complete without a photo op on the Grand Staircase."}
{"text":"Iconic and striking site of the former Pittsburgh and Lake Erie (P&LE) Railroad Line Station. Beautiful period stained glass and iron work with a grand staircase. Food is good but not excellent, service is above average, lunch portions are as large as most dinner portions. I had a lunch special which included bread, crackers and salmon pate, followed by Manhattan chowder, then shrimp & artichokes over pasta. Very nice for $16. If you're a tourist, stop here to look inside even if you do not dine here, then ride the incline up to Mount Washington."}
{"text":"The coolest thing about brunch here is sitting riverside and wandering from serving table to serving table in the grand lobby.  But be forewarned - without reservations they seat you in the Saloon.    Why not 4 or 5 stars?  The food.  It's a seafood restaurant, but on the brunch buffet they have maybe one seafood dish.  And everything is cold - even the stuff they bring out fresh from the kitchen is cold.  The food was so forgetful I can't remember a single dish."}
{"text":"Grand Concourse does a real nice business.  I was referred here by two sources, one by a downtown concierge, and another by a father of a friend.  I'm glad to find it was as good as all the hype.   Started off on a rough patch when they lost our same day reservation, but within 20 minutes a table was cleared and we were seated.  The customer service here was pretty over the top for our table, although I have to point out I did see a few patrons complain because every table was filled and it was nearly impossible to keep an eye on every table with the bread and water situation, due to a sold out capacity crowd on a Saturday night (wedding party renting out the ballroom).  The views are lovely here, with the national historic landmark of the grand concourse of the old Pittsburgh and Lake Erie railroad being put on display, as well as an enclosed train platform down by the river where you could watch the barge, and several freight trains go by- various CSN trains about 65 cars in length, every 15 minutes or so.  You can also take the adjacent \"T\" subway-surface car for $2 to downtown or suburban destinations.   Food was splendid, I highly recommend the Mediterranean chowder which was smallish but piping hot.   For dessert, chocolate lava cake covered in plain ice cream, chocolate coated, was so  rich that even I couldn't finish it.  My expectations were surpassed.  Being a historic landmark, it also had very enjoyable photography of the old train station. And the accolades of this venue include Best of Pittsburgh from AOL and other sources, for dinner as well as their highly touted Brunch!"}
{"text":"It has been a very long time since I have eaten here or even visited Station Square. What made it nice was that I had a Landry's reward that this restaurant participates in .My husband and I were seated fairly quickly. The two of us decided to go with the prix fix menu since we got there before 6.  That menu consists of a soup or salad, entree, and dessert. Specialty desserts like cheesecake are extra. The price of your menu is based on the entree chosen. I went with the crab cakes and he had the lemon chicken. We were first served bread and long crackers with two types of butter. The place was fairly empty so we got both our salads and main courses fairly quickly.   The food was okay. My two crabcakes came with rice and asparagus. My husband's chicken came with potatoes all on some sort of cream sauce. No sooner than we finished the main course the waitress brought out our chocolate mousse. The other dessert you could have had was vanilla ice cream.  We were blown away when we got our check. Just a little over $5.00! Earning those rewards really helped because this place is expensive. They have valet parking for $7.00 but if you prefer you can park either in their garage or across the street for less if you aren't staying that long. Business casual is the dress code."}
{"text":"Built in 1901 it is a beautiful restaurant.    Food was good.   Service could have used some help, wine came with the salads, and crab was a bit dry.     Nice bar for after dinner drinks!"}
{"text":"I went for the brunch Buffett with my wife on Sunday. Had reservations made almost a week in advance because it fills up. When we get there, checked in early, and waited. Waited for almost thirty minutes, went to ask how much longer since people that came in after were sitting down.   The gentleman working said they called us and we didn't respond. I told him how we have been here for thirty minutes and no one called our name. I'm assuming the low talker woman, that was calling names, had us and her attitude was real bad.   After a few minutes the gentleman made faces and puffed like a child. Said we were next. He NEVER apologized and the woman that sat us was in a mood too. How is it my fault or my wife's fault? They had three people calling names that day. Why didn't they tell the woman who had the voice of a bird to do something else?  Oh, the food, that would be good to mention too. To make a long story short, the it was not worth the price. The fish station made me sick, the prime rib was never filled again when it was gone, and the employees at the stations had the worst looks on their faces. Yes I know it's busy and you'd rather be doing something else, but at an eating establishment like this, should be better. Felt like the staff was hired from McDonalds.  Finally, the service was bad too."}
{"text":"This was by far my favorite brunch buffet ever. We came for Father's Day with reservations a few weeks before and it was a crowd pleaser for everyone. We got seated in a booth right next to the water and it was a beautiful view for our meal! Holy buffet though, they have anything and everything you want here from pancake/waffle/French toast stations, meat station, dessert station, entree station, oyster station and my favorite... The fresh doughnut station! These doughnuts were come out fresh, folks! I also liked that they made small versions of their desserts to encourage you to try more than one. There was also and omelet station and I'm sure more that I'm forgetting. I could go on and on about the food, but there was just so many delicious things. Our waiter was great in explaining where things were and some of his favorite things they offered. I think the buffet was about $27 a person and well worth it. It's in a beautiful old train station so there is plenty of uniqueness to the building itself.  If you like buffet brunches, this is the best one around. We will be back and I hope soon!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Pittsburgh and wanted to experience diner at a high end venue.  While the setting was perfect, the meal left us both with something less.  We sat beside a couple that enjoyed hearing themselves talk (very loud).  While our waiter was not excited about the prime rib, the waiter beside us raved about it.  I ordered the steak, which had a little too much fat than I would have liked. All in all it was not a bad experience, but should we visit Pittsburgh in the future, we would not go back to this restaurant.  Jim Fitzgerald Richmond, Va"}
{"text":"Such a great and beautiful place for brunch with big history! The food is delicious and a lot of choose from!"}
{"text":"The Grand Concourse is the definition of class in the middle of Pittsburgh. Station square is right along the river and this restaurant has great views - not that this would be necessary because the interior decor is worth the trip alone. There's usually someone playing the piano in the main dining room which I thoroughly enjoy. You're missing out if you've never been for Sunday brunch! Start with the fresh doughnuts at the bar area and work your way along every station!  I know it's on the pricier side, but live a little and try the Grand Concourse out!"}
{"text":"Decent dining option prior to seeing a show downtown? Check.  Excellent way to showcase Pittsburgh to a non-believing out-of-towner? Check.  Faaaaantastic Thanksgiving dinner with absolutely zero prep, zero cleanup, and out-of-this world selection of options? CHECK.  Not this year, but several years ago, we decided [as a family; it was a group decision, as these things must be] to forego slaving over 8.9 billion dishes in the kitchen in favor of going to the Grand Concourse. It was a good decision. No one missed not baking a boatload of pies/mashing a mountain of potatoes/scalding 7 gallons of giblets and gravy.  Why aren't we doing that tomorrow?  I don't actually know. Probably because we didn't make reservations."}
{"text":"Just so you know, this isn't like the Grand Concourse in the Bronx!  Being from NYC, when I think of Grand Concourse--a major thoroughfare in the Bronx-- I think of my friends who make some delicious Puerto Rican food, but when I went here, there wasn't a plantain to be seen!  However, I did go for the Sunday brunch and it was great.  There was so much variety...chicken, fish, beef, ham, pasta, shrimp....plenty of sweets...cakes, bananas, foster, etc.  Plus you could get traditional breakfast items like waffles or omelets, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, etc.  Surprisingly, there was not so much on the fruits and vegetables tip.  For kids they had chicken fingers and such.  Oh, and a donut making station.  The kids loved that!  Service from Victoria was excellent.  Bloody Mary's were exceptional.  The place itself is gorgeous...so beautiful with high ceilings and intricate carvings.  You really feel classy in a joint like this.  Too bad I was in shorts and a t-shirt.  Anyway, I enjoyed this a lot."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to the Grand Concourse for a long time, until I went a couple of weeks ago for brunch. Brunch is a buffet-style, all-you-can-eat affair.   The buffet items were mostly mediocre (bland, dry), which I guess is to be expected from a buffet. They did have made-to-order omelets as well, but I didn't get to try to them.  If I were to rate the place solely on the quality of the buffet, it would get two stars at most. However, there were a few highlights that earn it a bonus star...      - The bar makes a killer (but expensive) bloody mary.     - They have a cool little contraption that shoots out freshly made donuts.     - The setting in the old train station is nothing short of spectacular.   It's definitely worth going once for the experience, but I won't be in a rush to go back. Final verdict: Sit at the bar, order a bloody mary, and steal a donut or two."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant.  Great food.  The service was top notch.  Perfect place to celebrate a special occasion.  Food prices are higher as they should be for a place of this quality."}
{"text":"Excellent Sunday Brunch. Five stars, across the board. Warm welcome from hostess. Great table with quality white tablecloth. Polite waitress who kept my coffee cup refilled (though a carafe of coffee would be a plus). Polite staff at each of the buffet stations. Just a great experience.  I had good from the omelet station and it was a good, quality omelet. They have a good selection of meats and veggies, plus at least two choices in cheese. And with five or so burners cooking away, the queue moved quickly.  Hot table had scrambled eggs, sausages, potatoes, bacon, mac & cheese and a bunch of more that I can't recall. Cold table had a bunch of salad including a nice cucumber salad plus a macaroni salad and a pre-assembled Caesar. At least two different cooked salmon platters were out. Smoked salmon had the right fixings available including capers and chopped onions. I chose to have it on the flatbread rather than the bagel.  Carving station had a fab prime rib and also a turkey breast and a big ham. The beef was terrific and both au jus and horseradish sauce were not far away.  And then desserts. There's the donut making machine. There's a bananas foster station. There are cookies and pastries and something that might be apple struedel in a cream sauce.   Yeah, you'll go nuts here, leave stuffed and you will find that the Sunday Brunch Buffet is worth every penny of the $30 they charge."}
{"text":"I was sooooo disappointed!!  I love this building and the ambiance - it's a Pittsburgh landmark to be sure, but the buffet was mediocre at best.  I don't even know where to start.    Our waitress was friendly and prompt to come to the table but didn't provide any explanation as to how things were laid out and where things could be found.  This isn't something I normally need for a buffet but things aren't necessarily clear as to where they are - for instance the pancakes are at the omelet bar and the waffles are at the 'banana foster' table.  Anyway.....  I couldn't find the pancakes and I had read in another review that they did indeed have pancakes.  So after asking a passing server I was directed to the omelet bar and was really surprised when the omelet chef handed me four lukewarm pancakes for me to put on my plate.  They weren't made to order as I understood they would be.  On top of that they ended up being chewey and didn't have much flavor.   The main buffet was another disappointing experience - the chicken was dry, the roast beef was fatty and overall the main food line was average.  Unfortunately, if you're going to have a banana foster area, which can be a really nice touch, it's important to have  a server who knows what they're doing.  As it turned out, there was a young kid who couldn't tell you banana's foster from a banana split.  There were a couple of people in front of me that asked what a 'banana foster' was and his response was that it was anything you wanted it to be.  That answer confused the folks asking, so they passed. As did I.  Maybe it was just a bad day for them as I know other folks have good things to say.  If you want a beautiful place to take out-of-town visitors, this is certainly it.  But if you want to have a really nice buffet experience, sadly this wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"Went to Grand concourse yesterday for dinner. I was extremely disappointed in the food. We ordered the coconut shrimp, the shrimp fresco, Martha's Vineyard salad, and the Brie as an appetizer and some orange sherbet for dessert. First off, my lettuce was SOGGY. I was starving but I really should have sent it back. I'm from Chicago and this place doesn't compare in the taste of food to any place in the Windy City. The shrimp was dry and un-flavorful and the shrimp fresca was spaghetti with the same butterfly shrimp that I got. For just over $50/person, I think there are better restaurants out there. The only reason this place can get away with the poor quality is because of the location- it's right on the river and the view IS beautiful but I will definitely not go again. Total rip-off."}
{"text":"As old school and traditional Pittsburgh as you can get. I've been here several times in my life and for the most part everything is always spot on. There are so many new places that continue to pop up but it's nice to know an old favorite is still available."}
{"text":"My wife and I are from Akron, Ohio and spent last weekend at Station Square for a Valentine's day getaway. We ate at Grand Concourse last Saturday evening, Feb 18th. Ambiance was very nice ! Other than that, we have nothing much good to say about Grand Concourse. This place is very much over rated & over priced in our opinion. Wife & I both ordered appetizers. My $7.00 Clam Chowder came in a big bowl but chowder was no more than 1/4 inch off the bottom of bowl. Wife's $13.00 Shrimp appetizer consisted of 5 small shrimp. Waiter took order & left before we could order a salad nor did waiter even ask if we wanted a salad. After completing our appetizers, we sat there 15 min & still had not received my diet coke or given any bread. Had to remind waiter that I ordered a diet coke & ask for bread. Both wife & I had Cowboy steak entree with mashed potatoes. Steak was ok but mashed potatoes were cold, hard as a rock & very lumpy. Spent well over $100 and we had no salads, no alcoholic beverages and no deserts. Go elsewhere to eat ! Do not recommend Grand Concourse. I am sure Pittsburgh has many other fine restaurants that offer much better quality food for the money."}
{"text":"Interesting evening.  I asked if I could have a substitution of the salmon rockerfeller to mahi mahi instead.  When I was served my meal, I was told the chef was able to do so and our server left.  I am eating it, but it was not what I ordered or told what I would get. It was dynamite mahi mahi which was on the menu not mahi, mahi rockerfeller.  When I questioned the server about it when she came to clear our plates and inquired about it(she never checked on us), she said it didn't look like what I ordered, but served it anyway. Then when she brought the check, she said, yep, it wasn't what I ordered but I got the dynamite mahi mahi.  No apologies, just a smile.  What a disappointing experience for such a high caliber restaurant."}
{"text":"Holy Brunch Buffet Batman!  There's a difference between a place that has one long table of buffet choices that's mass produced and more than likely been sitting out for most of the morning and the Grand Concourse.  The Grand Concourse is just that, GRAND!  The Grand Concourse may have that one long table of buffet foods that have possibly been touched by little kid sticky hands BUT they have \"create your own\" food stands!  Any place that offers me the chance to pile on the most scrumptious and fattening food toppings is a winner in my book!  Stop by the make your own omelet or pancake or waffle or ICE CREAM SUNDAE (can you tell how excited I am about that) bar for your own sinful creation.    And the place itself....just breathtaking!  You don't come across many places like this anymore.  It used to be the main train station into downtown Pittsburgh and they've really done a fantastic job making it look as it did back in the day.  I swear to god I always want to act out the scene in the Titanic where they're all sitting around the main dining room together talking all proper.  But then I remember I'm shoveling 30 pounds worth of pancakes in my mouth and that vision quickly dissolves!  *Remember if you want to go for brunch make a reservation!    Bon voyage on your eating adventure!"}
{"text":"We went for my best friends birthday on Feb 3, 2018 for brunch. This was our first time visiting the Grand Concourse so we were excited. We didn't know it was better to have reservations. The host told us we can be seated anywhere on our own in a separate dining area without a reservation . Ok cool. So we sat down in a booth and waited for our server. She walked past us at least 5 times without saying hello. After 15 minutes, I flagged down the next waitress I seen and asked if we could at least order drinks. She said, oh! Your server must have not seen you sit down?!? So the \"flagged down\" waitress got our drinks. We got up to get our food from the buffet and we're seated again. I seen our server 2 more times, and she still didn't even say hello. We needed drink refills. I again, asked the \"flagged down\" waitress for refills. She said, sure. I then asked, so are you our waitress now? She says,\" yes, I'll be taking over\". I am not sure if we were seated in the wrong area or what but our waitress never said 1 word to us. She could have, at the very least, told us this was not the correct place to sit for self seating. IDK. Overall, the service was poor and I will not be visiting this restaurant again. I gave 2 stars for the delicious donuts."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE service for brunch! We made a reservation through open table to give us plenty of time to eat before the Steelers game, and half an hour after our time, the rude, unfriendly hostess told us there was still one table ahead of us. After 5 more parties were called (and 10 more minutes passed), we finally got a table.  Fortunately, brunch is buffet style so we jumped right in. The food was mediocre at best, but nothing as great as I've heard from others. Not good enough to justify the high price...  The saving graces of the day were our server - Very nice and friendly - and the mimosas. Delicious!  My suggestion, go elsewhere. There are too many good brunch places to waste your time with their unorganized brunch and rude staff."}
{"text":"I'd like to give this place 3 1/2 stars if I could.  It's a solid restaurant in a beautiful location.  I had an early dinner there tonight with my Mom and Sister.  The service was excellent.  We had the calamari, \"dynamite\" scallops, and an avocado and crabmeat terrine.  The scallops were the best.  They were cooked perfectly and had a nice sauce.  The calamari was good.  It had a bit more breading than I would like, but was cooked perfectly.  The terrine would have been excellent, but the avocado wasn't ripe.  I had the bouillabase which was flavored okay and had a decent selection of seafood, but they put in half of a crab that really wasn't that good quality.  It reminded me of crab you would receive at an all you can eat crab place.  Mom had some lobster that was pretty good, but a little overpriced.  The best entree by far was my sisters.  She had the alaskan king crab legs, steamed perfectly and a very large portion.  In addition they cracked the shell which was a nice touch.  This was a very good deal for the quality and quantity at $43.  The desserts were probably the best part of the meal.  Strawberry shortcake was light and probably one of the best I've ever had and the chocolate souffle was awesome.  I think the valet should be complimentary.  It's $6 for 2 hours.  If you  spend a couple of hundred dollars for three people I think they should waive this nominal fee.  They also had a pianist which was a nice touch and much better than \"musac\".  Overall a very fine restaurant and the building is gorgeous and a must see if your visiting pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Heads up they will not seat you in the main signing area without a reservation, even if they have tables a Alia le.This place has the largest buffet spread I have ever seen. It's on par with any Disney resort. The bloody Mary choices are unreal, I could have sat and ate food for hours.  My favorites: - pancake station / waffle bar - the dirt cup desert is made of chocolate mousse  - desert bar  - omlitte station"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is spectacular! Service average. Food was not hot when served, slow! Seemed 2 be short handed. Expressed my concerns 2 the manager who did not seem 2 be concerned. Have dined there for many special occasions and never had a problem. Hope they just had an off night!"}
{"text":"Beautiful marble mahogany brass and stained glass interior matched by elegant dishes. 16oz ribeye."}
{"text":"I loved the look of this restaurant that was once the train station. Old Hollywood feel. I ordered the Surf and Turf and it was amazingly delicious -short ribs, scallops, mashed potatoes."}
{"text":"If you are willing to pay more, and to stand in line with relatively large crowds, then this place has the best Sunday Brunch in Pittsburgh. The setting is beautiful and classy, but also casual enough that you will see many people in their Steeler's jerseys on football Sundays. Everything that we tried here was very good, from the smoked salmon, to the pastries, egg dishes, sausages, etc. There is a very large selection of food, an omelet bar, and fresh sqeezed orange juice. I have heard from some folks that their dinner is not quite as good, but If you feel like treating yourself on a nice Sunday morning, this is the place to do it.  When I wrote this review, I believe that the price was $18 a person. I went back recently, and it was $26 a person.  Quite an increase, not as good value for sure - but still worth the expense occasionally - if you have a hearty appetite."}
{"text":"*Shrugs*  As usual, the food at the Grand Concourse disappointed by being overpriced, portions too large, and too greasy with butter.    The best parts of the meal were the bread basket, the clam appetizer,  the Martha's Vineyard Salad and the Mango Sorbet.   We were a large party (12) seated in the River Room celebrating a special occasion on a recent Saturday night. We were given menus promptly and told that the kitchen was out of a bunch of offerings already and were too busy to do anything special.  We had to guess what the kitchen was out of ( I suppose, since we were never informed as to what was lacking so we were expected to make a couple choices then take a risk that we picked something still available.)  Several people got the planked salmon, one the bouillabaisse, one Dungeness crab, a couple of people got the mixed seafood trio. I learned a while ago that the fewer ingredients or sauces in the meal at Grand Concourse, the better it is in terms of taste. Unfortunately my salmon was overcooked and very greasy. (in the past the fish has been prepared well.) The roasted potatoes and asparagus (2 HUGE woody, fibrous spears.) were slathered in butter & very salty, but nothing else - no garlic even. The gnocchi was \"...shrug.\" Everyone else kind of said their meals were \"OK,\" but were disappointed that their first choices were gone. The best I can say is that it was served hot.  The bouillabaisse was full of huge unmanageable pieces of seafood- not typical of real bouillabaisse.)  The mango sorbet seemed freshly made, had no ice crystals, and didn't seem to have added sugar- not too much if any. It really was good and served with a little rolled cookie. The portion was way too large - about a cup. The white chocolate cheesecake was pronounced \"bland\" by one person, and \"the worst I have ever had- not that it was terrible, but who can't do a good cheesecake - even the stuff from Sam's Club is far better than this\"  by another. They had none of their signature chocolate mousse.    I had a glass of Malbec which was good. Others had various other wines and mixed drinks, etc. Standard draft beers- only one local.  They were very busy and our 2 waiters were fairly efficient. However, the one guy commanded our attention twice by yelling at us to quiet down so he could talk. At one point he stopped listing his specials and glared at one of the guests who hadn't seen he was standing at the side of the table because they were talking to someone at the other end of the table. He couldn't be heard over the noise of the crowded room. It might be better if GC printed their specials.) . I am sure there was a much better way of handling it. 2 stars for being bossy and not offering beverage refills: coffee refill was offered after dessert ( the first cup was ordered with appetizers,) and no refill offered for over 2 hours. They never asked if we wanted more wine or beer either.   Most people go here to take first time Burgh visitors to see the beautiful building and dine in the River Room and watch the city and river day or night- you don't go for the food and you make sure you are prepared for the high prices - you are paying for location. (Frankly, I wouldn't take them here - I'd go elsewhere and take them up to Mt Washington's overlooks.)   Valet parking is cheap.   If you go: dress up a little and like a grown up ( there was a 30 YO wearing a backwards ball cap for God's sake)  get the appetizers, salad and eat the bread basket, fresh fruit desserts or sorbet. Don't get anything \"fancy.\" Stick with the more simple preparations.   Better yet, save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This has an extremely romantic view of the river that is aesthetically pleasing near sunset.   Recommend the jerk fish dish.  Thankfully the seating area  is enclosed otherwise the noise from a nearby rail line could ruin the mood.  Would recommend being indoors for that reason.   The interior could be maintained a bit better.  Of course given the price, it is understandable why the place less than totally packed.  Traffic through here appears \"preventatively priced\".  Not good for families unless one has high income or a lot of savings.  Mostly saw business singles eating together and not very many couples and no families."}
{"text":"We will be back, love love love this place. A wedding party was going on in another room. Great photo ops."}
{"text":"Poor service?There is a nail on the chair and it broke my pants. And they said what did you want? Excuse me?I was stuck on the chair for five seconds and luckily  my leg is not scratched. What do I want? No sorry no apology! Well, since you asked, I need my pants to be fixed."}
{"text":"I preface my review by saying the Grand Concourse provides a great atmosphere and ambiance for a family outing. Great river views and a \"grand\" interior, hence the name. Good times can be had by all at this establishment.  I have dined here several times over the past 5 years when visiting my wife's side of the family in the Burgh. They do an excellent spread for a brunch buffet and for Easter. From custom pancake and omelet station, to fresh donuts to a nice selection of smoked fish.  My experience dining there for dinner about a year ago was slightly different. I find their offerings to be highly over priced. Then again I think only the \"best of the best\" restaurants should be charging $30+ a plate.   We had a variety of appetizers, some better than others. The Calamari was very fresh and quite good. The Blue Point Oysters (raw) were also fresh, not a bad one in the dozen. The Brie with apple chutney was a nice sweet/savory appetizer. The crab crusted scallops, recommended by the waiter, were...odd and mushy.  For my entree I ordered the duo of Salmon, the King Ivory (white salmon) and their typical \"plank\" preparation (pink salmon). It was served with a side of rice and grilled asparagus. This plate was $36, nevertheless, I jumped at the chance to order Ivory Salmon as it is a highly seasonal fish and if prepared right is one of my favorites. Unfortunately, both pieces of salmon were badly overcooked my guess is they were frozen. Borderline above well-done when it is a fish that should be medium-rare to medium. They did the white salmon zero justice as I have had this.  We ordered the canoli's for desert, again recommended by the server, touting that they were selected as the best desert out of 100 some odd other deserts by Bobby Flay. The canoli's were disappointing after a glowing review.  Overall the service was nice, the wine was great, the food just okay. Again, you are in for a more palatable experience when dining for brunch - which I will look forward to again in the coming months."}
{"text":"Absolute family favorite.  Accommodating to the smallest to largest of parties. The bar is casual enough to roll in wearing casual clothes and the dining rooms each offer a space that can be used for family meals, business dining,"}
