{"text":"Food: Breaded shrimp was overcooked, oily, and the layer of batter was almost as thick as the shrimp. Bruschetta was stone cold , and did not taste fresh at all. I also ordered their classic hot wings which the waiter said were really spicy. Adding vineger to give the illusion of spicyness is an insult to chicken wings, and on top of that the other flavours were completely non-existent. The four cheese spinach dip with deep fried chips tasted like it was microwaved, and it looked caked and dehydrated around the corners of the bowl. 

Service: Quick and cheerful.

Overall: Would not visit this Kelsey's again."}
{"text":"After a day of traveling from Detroit, our motel suggested Kelsey and provided us with a 'free appetizer\" card.  The restaurant was fairly new, but part of a restaurant chain.  I would say it was similar to Applebee's or Friday's in terms of menu,  layout and feel.
Our waitress was quite busy but it was after 8 PM, and the place was not full.  The appetizer was good, not great.  We ordered their \"Burger 101\" which was OK but not close to say Ruby Tuesday's similar item.  We had 2 glass of house wine, which was also OK but not great.  The atmosphere was terrible for dinning, we were seated near a table of 6 tipsy, loud women.  There were tables with screaming kids, and the background music was loud & annoying.  There didn't appear to be any management people on duty, so we ate and left, never to return!!"}
{"text":"Finally they employed a waiter who knows how to make you feel special, too bad I forgot his name but he was a new waiter who used to work at the woodbridge location. He made my familys experience very enjoyable and fun. The food was good and fresh, the decor however is in major need of an upgrade. This place needs to be remodelled big time. Cozy little place great for kids. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Service here is extremely lacking. It's been 20 minutes and a server has yet to check up on us. We've been trying to get the attention of a waitress for the past 10 minutes, and none of them are around or paying attention; they're in the corners of the restaurant chatting. 

Additionally, I ordered a steak and it was quite dry and flavorless. 

I tend not to complain about service, but this was a quiet Sunday and it wasn't very busy at all. Extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"As usual this is a place to bring friends. The staff is young and attractive. The food is average at best but my high score comes from the people who sit at the bar. It's always a fun place to sit and strike up a conversation. I tell my single friends to go here and have fun. 
 Order the 101 burger and leave the steaks to a steakhouse. The best apps are fried   

Expect to have fun, not an award winning meal. The Tvs are always on and the employees dance throughout the day. It's always fun to be around happy employees. 
Jay - the GM - will stop at nothing to ensure you are happy. If you're not, ask for him."}
{"text":"Such a horribly disappointing experience!  And don't both telling your server or manager as they clearly do not care. I thought this place maybe got a bit better after then Reno but apparently not. Our server did everything she could do avoid our table. Busy or not busy, ask someone for help or apologize or something??? We're on a lunch break and do not have all day so I dont appreciate being avoided on purpose. On top of it. My steak dinner came out with terrible terrible sides. And the server says wish I knew I could have got u something else? How the heck would you know if you were avoiding out table the entire time. 

Save yourself the hassle and go anywhere else but here!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing time here at Kelsey's tonight, our meals were delicious and the service was very speedy.   They even made my pregnant wife's picky order perfectly!   Definitely coming back soon.

The huge projector showing the game was the icing on the cake."}
{"text":"Let's just say it took forever to get dinner we didn't get a glass of water... Horrible horrible services had about 6 ppl serving us.. Never again"}
{"text":"I don't even care about the service or anything about this place but their Guiness pot pie with mashed potatoes,is the best. I mean the service could suck everytime I go there but as long as they have that on the menu I would be back. Its served in a hot skilled with beans, and a thick sauce, that just sticks to your ribs. ( or atleast my bony ones). Have it with a guiness beer and really what more do you need on a crappy fall day, its heaven in a skillet!."}
{"text":"Bad service - refused to use any coupons even though they were still valid. Ditzy waitress couldn't do two coupons at once -fine - but then refused to use even one. When I asked to speak to the manager he refused to come out.  The restaurant was dead and it was a Saturday night. Not good customer service at all. Food lacks care - looks like it was thrown on a plate. Even if the food was good we won't be returning - service is everything in this day and age."}
{"text":"Portions not the same as other locations
Burger small dry and half burnt
Kids pizza was worse then McDonalds pizza.
Fries were good!"}
{"text":"This place fell off like a big mac topping.

The redecoration has the feel of entering the doors of a Kate Spade to being seated in the center-left of an Old Navy. The sea-foams, bright pinks and late tween female bedroom decor look of neo-elegantly grafittoed chalkboards, bulbed displays and hyper lit interior is in clear contrast to the paired down menu and sup bar eats that scream \"dingy bar\".

I must be a glutton for punishment because I came months back with my SO and ordered the Seafood Pasta dish to much fizzle...yet here we return. While awaiting Jurrasic World showtime, we come in for a bite only to find that the disappointment was far from a one off. 

A solid pitch was thrown in presentation when our (very friendly, kind, and professional) server delivered the fish tacos! First bite- strike one; tasted JUST like my microwave used to make. Coming straight down the middle, we were pitched Jerk Chicken Tacos (stop drooling, you look simple....and) another complete strike - lets pause for a second and discuss this one right hurr:

Now. I am a man of Caribbean descent and I understand that \"jerk\" is relative in numerous ways; location, tradition, commercial vs home, etc...but where in chthulus green earth is Jerk EVER, EVER made with mayonnaise? Rass...

Strike two.

I will say that our guest gave the ceaser salad wraps a passable grade. Ball one Kelseys, ball f'in one.

Our showtime came but was sold out so we came back to watch the NBA Final and continue our excersice in gastro-masochism...this round we got the popcorn shrimp app: thickly breaded with what tasted like flour and dorito dust and served with the exact same sweet chili thai dip Pizza Pizza serves! except worse! The shrimp tasted like poverty and the dip had a flavour akin to depression with hints of regret. In the 20 min. it took for our  (albeit friendly) server to return, 2 shrimps were eaten and she immediately swapped that terrible memory out for the Spinach Dip, ahem \"Spinach Dip\", better named \"bowl of cream cheese with no name brand microwaved spinach stirred in...so b√¥n apetit, bitch\" - strike, like 4 man....my baseball analogy kinda got lost there but whatever, I'm a basketball man, man.

That shit was so bad, Lebron James saw us eating it and lost the game to Golden State.

So to sum: decor looks like a Katy Perry teenage fans room, food tastes like hate and depression and service is...scattered at best BUT the servers themselves are awesome people.

Go if: you want wine on tap
Dont go if: you have shreds of dignity and self respect"}
{"text":"Good menu variety, tv's in bar area, my favourite thing to get is the spinach dip, broccoli cheddar soup and balsamic chicken dish. The staff was fine. Not very personable, caesar salad lacked dressing, balsamic chicken lacked sauce (I had to ask for extra because I was not even having it), dessert lacked Caramel sauce, CLEARLY every course skimped on the sauce. This is my FAVOURITE restaurant but NOT this location, Oshawa location is much better."}
{"text":"My go to location for a relaxing meal during lunch or for a quiet time with friends. Started going there with friends a few weeksb ago and can't stop.
Had no issues with service and the weekday drink special make the experience more entertaining with the right group.

Can't wait to review to update my review once the patio is open."}
{"text":"YUCK! we went to our area Kelsey's (trafalgar & dundas) for the first time since their renovation and absolutely HATED IT! No more cozy and inviting interior and no more separation between the bar & dining area. Two people in our group left with a pounding headache due to the extremely loud music! We were there for dinner at 7pm!!!! Let the music get loud at 9pm but people at 7pm want to be able to hear each other. And our group span from teenagers to middle-aged, we're not ninety years old.
Sorry Kelsey's north Oakville - never again"}
{"text":"At the end of the day this place is a Kelsey's. You kinda know what your going to get. Generic american standard affair. The service has always been good. I like the California Club House Wrap. I would recommend if the Jack Astors up the street is full and you want a quick bite to eat before a movie at Colosseum."}
{"text":"The place had good service. When we sat down to order they first asked if we were seeing a movie (since there's a theater right next door), so they know whether to hurry up with the order or not, which is nice."}
{"text":"i actually really like going to this kelseys now because they have made renovations and changed up the menu. The burgers are quite delicious"}
{"text":"Every time I call to order take out, I'm passed from one person to the next and eventually left on hold until I hang up and call Montana's instead."}
{"text":"Just left this location and had a wonderful experience! I hadn't been to a Kelseys in years but remembered liking the Buffalo chicken sandwich. Still had it and it was great! I wanted to order a starter garlic cheese loaf that looked delishious but sadly they didn't have any. The waitress apologized and I was OK with that, a bit disappointed but not angry or upset at all. The manager came over on his own and apologized again for not having the product and explained why. Totally awesome and unexpected! It was nice to show they cared and felt bad about the situation. 
Our waitress was great! Very nice, fast service and no mistakes. Left very happy and would defiantly go back and recommend this location. 
I also loved the look of the drink menu but sadly was unable to drink to try something. Next time!"}
{"text":"Stay away. The food is badly overpriced. I ordered a steak medium rare. It can well done. I sent it back and the new one came almost well done. I guess they don't like to serve any pink in their steaks. It was like eating rubber. Not an enjoyable experience. Stay away."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place based on the new decor. But alas. It didn't live up to expectations. 

I only had drinks here, so I can't comment on food. Suffice it to say, if you're craving a cocktail...just stick to beer. The classic mojito and the white grape Cosmo were just terrible. The main issue? The weird artificial aftertaste. The menu said that the drinks would have fresh lime juice but I am 100% sure they used the artificial kind."}
{"text":"The worst customer service I have ever had. The server was not helpful, pushy, and forgot to bring my drink to me! I have been here a couple times and never had such bad customer service in my life. I would definitely not recommend this location at all. The was good but the service was terrible."}
{"text":"Ok, I usually have nothing bad to say about restaurants or establishments - cause i am a nice guy - unless of course it was a horrible or crappy service.

So I went to Kelsey's last night for dinner with a friend, and I have ate at Kelsey's many times before - just not this location.  For those of you who have never been to Kelsey's, Kelsey's is a restaurant chain that gives you a little a bit of everything - burgers, pasta, seafood, steak, ribs, salads, soups, blah, blah, blah etc.

Anyways I went to Kelsey's the service was slow from the moment I stepped into the door.  I don't know if it was a cost cutting initiative but there was one waitress for like 10 tables .... anyways so the service was totally slow she came by once to ask for refills on our cokes and wings - it never came - its hard to have all you can eat wings - when the wings never make it to the bloody table!!! LOL

Anyways after waiting for a billion years (40 plus minutes) - I asked for the manager (mark?) and he was like maybe she forgot and took the wings off the bill - good job mark, but totally ruined my evening.

Cons - slow service, waitress had attitude,  manager was sorry but he could of done more,

Pros - food was good, 

In closing, I like Kelsey's, in fact I like it more than some of the other chains but HELL to the NO will I visit this location again."}
{"text":"Came in here with some family on Thursday since they have price wings. One thing I found odd is that it is not advertised anywhere and the only reason we knew is because  friend asked a waitress last time they were here, several weeks ago. Anyways we got buffalo potato skins and they were pretty good.  As for the wings we all decided to go boneless and get several flavors to share. The flavors them selves tasted good, however the wings were way too hard and crunch. You literally had to work to cut those things in half. All in all not a terrible place but the service is a bit slow and food is inconsistent."}
{"text":"The wife and I wanted to use up our Bon Appetite gifts cards and while tired of Harvey's and Swill Chalet, we both hate the over priced pretentiousness of Milestones and its truly lousy food.

So we decided to try Kelsey's and we were glad we did.  Fast service on a crowded Saturday night had us at our table in no time and our orders within minutes.  

We enjoyed traditional roadhouse food like calamari and potato skins for appetizers that were better than expected, and a nice burger and fries and a steak sandwich for entrees.  Everything was cooked the way we'd asked and the portions were larger than we'd expected, which is a good thing.

The place was clean (especially the washrooms), the staff were friendly and efficient, the televisions plentiful enough to catch the game, the beer cold and the food pretty good.  It's everything that you want in a restaurant of its kind which is why we will definitely be back there again when we're hankering for similar fair.  And milestones can kiss our bu......"}
{"text":"Food is ok, tortillas are great, but I had it a year ago and don't think they have it on their menu anymore. The wings are dry."}
{"text":"Havent been to a kelseys in so long. Their menu is all new, i had a huge chicken Caesar salad sooooo good. My boyfriend had the buffalo chicken wrap, he said it was really spicy and he likes spicy. Their drink menu has alot of cool drinks. We had a deep fried mars bar for dessert, best thing ever! A must try. We sat in the bar to watch hockey on their big screen with sound we can never find a bar here with sound. The blond bartender was super attentive excellent service. Will probably be our new friday night hang out."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner tonight, had a bunch of appetizers instead of entrees. We ordered the quesadillas, chicken Buffalo potato wedges, and the spinach dip. Spinach dip is a classic and was amazing, I recommend it to anyone even if you don't like spinach. The quesadilla were good, they had tons of flavour but could have been a little crispier. Chicken buffalo wedges weren't bad but we're too spicy for my taste. My cousin didn't like the ranch flavour on the wedges but I didn't mind it. Staff were nice, friendly, and welcoming. Overall had a good experience here."}
{"text":"Kelseys is Kelseys.   I really like the new interior.  That said   a little disappointed that when we got here we where told that it would be a 20 min wait.   This fine except that the dining room was 70% empty."}
{"text":"Second time coming here since they renovated, and had horrible service both times. Nobody seems to be in a hurry to take your order, and when they finally do, they don't even bother writing it down. Both times, somebody's order at our table was wrong, and they messed up the bills. Not going back again"}
{"text":"Great burgers!  Cool atmosphere. It gets busy especially with the movies beside. A little pricey but I enjoyed the food. I would go back. I enjoy it more than the Milestones or Montana's next door."}
{"text":"I went here with my husband for a date night a couple of weekends ago.  I was a little unhappy with where we were seated (by a really full and loud table).  Our server was very, very nice and attentive. 

I was really looking forward to trying the wings but they were a starter and didn't come with a side, so I went for the chicken fingers and sweet potato fries.  My husband got the messy fish sandwich with sweet potato fries.  We both agreed that the fries were just ok (certainly not the best we've had).  He loved his sandwich, whereas I wasn't a huge fan of my chicken fingers.  BUT my husband tasted them and he liked them, so maybe it's just me.  We shared a fried mars bar for dessert, but neither of us liked it.  I wouldn't say that that was Kelsey's fault though.  I don't think they prepared it incorrectly or anything.  

We'd go back there for dinner again to try out some more of their menu, but I wouldn't have the chicken fingers or the mars bar again, and I'd probably try their regular fries as a side just to compare."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the rebrand. All of the homey comfort and charm of Kelsey's is gone. Why does a bar and grill needs a \"club\" atmosphere? The loud music and harsh new lighting gave my wife and I an instant and intense headache.  Kelsey's is a place to talk and east with friends. Watch the game or just relax without the pretension of Milestones or Montana's.
The menu had no improvements. The chicken parm sandwich I ordered was soggy and came on a grocery store bought bun. 
Why a well established brand like Kelsey's is trying to copy Jack Astor's instead of improving on what they already do so well is a mystery to me.
This location was always the standard for what wad good with a restaurant. When ever we would have a bad experience elsewhere, this location's excellent service and comfortable atmosphere always restored or faith in chain restaurants. Im sad that is gone. I will only be back as a last resort. There are to many alternatives to choose from in this neighborhood to have to expose myself to this place again!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location a few times since they have done their renovations, and all I can really say is that I am impressed with the restaurant by far. Excellent service, brand new redesigned menu, brand new look/feel/atmosphere. Definitely a place to go. 

Spinach dip is amazing fyi"}
{"text":"The Steak & Guinness skillet was awful and I wasn't impressed with the lack of variety on the menu. It was really cold in the restaurant so the waitress was kind enough to move us to another table, but the vent was still blowing freezing air above us. It isn't an upscale venue yet the prices are up in that ally. I was warned but now I know not to go unless I am proved otherwise with a free meal."}
{"text":"Service when there is more than 3 people in the restaurant is atrocious, would not recommend coming during any function in Scarborough, go to Boston pizza down the street!"}
{"text":"Usually not too busy so never have to wait long. Food is okay. Drinks are good. Service is average. Dessert is always delicious. Atmosphere is kind of weird. Music was super loud one night.. Not sure if they're going for a bar/club vibe or family restaurant (which its always been)"}
{"text":"Came here in weekday lunch, only 2 tables in the dinning room but took it more than 40 mins to get our food. Ask the waitress just replu us they only got 1 chef this afternoon.

The food is bad, my wife order a shrimp curry bowl, you never feel there is curry taste, actuall no taste at all. will never come back here"}
{"text":"Not impressed with the quality of the food. We had ordered the sizzling fajitas, grilled salmon and a kids meal. Not appetizing, didn't seem fresh and tasted all right; a bit disappointed. The ambiance is just about all right, service was friendly, bu don't think will visit again."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with half priced wings on thu. Kick up your pint (up size to 23oz)for a dollar...it is no moxies when it comes to waitress hotness but they are super friendly."}
{"text":"Ok - so the new vibe took some time to get used to. Kelsey's has always been a family restaurant with a bar to me. The new feel is a yuppie lounge. 

Staff are fun an the beer selection is great. But I hate the new menu. There's a few exceptions - like the goat cheese flatbread. 

But the one thing that really drives me crazy are the sayings (Happiness Always) and the silly signs. 

Out of ten - I have to say a six."}
{"text":"Love going here with my family, we make it a habit of going here at least once a week for its great food and great service. Ps try the spinach dip it's amazing!"}
{"text":"Love going here with my family. We bounce back from this location and the queen location and love. Both stores are amazing and always have the best service and best food!"}
{"text":"This Kelsey's has been rebranded from their \"family\" theme to what I feel like is a \"Jack Astor's/Milestone's\" like theme. This Kelsey's used to be good but it seems really unorganized in here now.   

Atmosphere: (Rebranded) The layout of the tables is horrible, the waiters had to walk around several tables to get to certain areas. In terms of privacy at your table, it lacks in certain areas compared to previous Kelsey's layout. And also, it's really loud in there and I personally preferred the old Kelsey's more.  

Food: Their menu has been shrunk'd down but still has their several dishes like the Messy Fish Sandwich and etc. The price has increased a little bit as well. Also, during my visit to this Kelsey's, it appears that their food is still inconsistent with quality, I've seen two dishes bounced back due to the cooking.  

Service/Management: This new Kelsey's is more unorganized than the previous Kelsey's. The waiters do not appear to have designated tables as they flustered around our area and overlapped other tables. We also had a manager come to our table to check if we were ready to order, when we only sat down for like 10 minutes, and told our waitress to come back. Talk about micromanaging!   

Final Verdict: The old Kelsey's used to be our go-to restaurant prior/after movies... I think Montana's now our choice as I do not like being crammed in their horrible table layouts and the loud atmosphere."}
{"text":"My family and I always stop at Kelsey's for lunch when traveling from NY to Michigan. I had a Cosmo which was delicious. I got the Reuben spring rolls. The idea of them is brilliant and they were super tasty. My mom got the chicken Caesar salad and they nailed it. On the way back we got flat breads. We got the chicken and goat cheese flat bread and the burchetta. The crust was thick and actually held all the ingredients together. It was also a very big flat bread perfect for sharing. I would go there again on my next trip."}
{"text":"We stopped in here last night before a movie as we\" always go to Montanas\" the last time I was at this location before the reno I ended up crying in the bathroom after biting into a chicken strip that was fully raw in the middle. The texture of luke warm raw chicken is imprinted on my memory forever. Reluctantly I agreed seeing as they've obviously made some changes. 
The new design is cool although I don't imagine the tall tables in the middle are very comfortable physically or socially, we were lucky to get a booth. The menu is a HUGE disappointment with only a few uninspired options which are mostly burgers and sandwiches. We ordered 2 burgers.
The burgers are huge and seem to be made in house. They are however sloppy and hard to eat, not first date material. The toppings are generous even the goat cheese and we both enjoyed them but it was definitely not worth the huge price tag.
Fridays they have 5$ martinis so I ordered a white grape cosmo. I thought it was great but it is really sweet, tastes like my 19th birthday. I even ordered a second round which was inconsistent and had much more lime than the first one. Still not bad though
 Overall the experience was meh. Pretty much what I expect from a Cara chain restaurant. The only big disappointment was the skimpy menu. I wished we had just gone to Montanas again"}
{"text":"after reading the contradicting reviews on Yelp about Kelsey's, off we went anyway. 

 I wasn't really expect much , but I had to say that surprisingly I enjoyed the meal from the beginning to the end! 

The ambience was wonderful and with great atmosphere; We ordered fire-grilled sirloin steak and Fajita and a kid's meal for the boy . the food were delicious and yummy!the portions are big and since we were very hungry on that day , we finished them all and were so full !!!  One funny thing was that I couldn't find the tortilla that came along with the Fajita , and with the help of our waiter I found them right under my nose : they were put inside the container under the hot iron skillet!  the service is quick, our waiter Jack is very nice and friendly . In the end he gave me the recommendation on desserts and we ordered the funnel cake fries with strawberry ice cream. Never have had something like that before, it was amazingly tasty! 

We will be back!"}
{"text":"I just don't like the food here. I don't know why I keep going back thinking that it'll be different from the last time. It never is.

This particular time, he got the barbecue chicken sandwich (which he actually liked) with a side of cheese over a tiny salad. I had the bacon cheeseburger that came with a side of fries. They also had a promotion going on where you can add a appetizer (or half an app) to your meal for $5. We got the loaded fries. It looked nothing like the picture, not their fault though since it doesn't usually look like the picture. But it had barely any cheese and the gravy was salty and more onion than anything else. It was basically sour cream and fries.

I don't know. It wasn't that awful where it was inedible, but I left feeling sad and unsatisfied.


**Also, because it was the middle of the day, there were only maybe 2 servers working. We stood at the front waiting to be seated for a good 10 minutes. There was no one working at the bar, there was no one walking around the restaurant to see us - even as they were coming out of the kitchen, they didn't even look towards the front to check.

Maybe I shouldn't rate restaurants when I started out hungry and grumpy."}
{"text":"Food is good, just had the Breakfast Burger. Place is nice, has this retro chic feel. Service is SLOW!!! It's Saturday lunch, place is not even quarter full and the food took so long!!!"}
{"text":"My family stopped by on a Saturday afternoon for a late lunch. We ordered a clucky chicken parm and a chicken beet & goat cheese salad. The food came fairly quickly, and consistent in quality in compared to another Kelsey's. However, that was the end of the positives. 

The problem we had was that we had to change our daughter's diaper. In the ladies' washroom, the change station was dirty with brown stains and the safety belt was missing one end! My daughter bawled as soon as I put her down. I basically haphazardly changed her and got out of there as soon as I could, after wiping her hands and my change mat, of course.

Unfortunately, we hurried out of there after the washroom horror. We didn't realize we got overcharged. Salad was $15.99. Chicken parm was $12.99. Sweet potato fries upgrade was maybe $1.99. That should be about $30 + tax = ~$34. But it ended up being $37.25. We didn't take the itemized receipt and only have the payment receipt, so we don't know what they added to our bill.

We won't be returning."}
{"text":"AWFUL location chain with the actual worst service I've ever experienced at a restaurant. I came here a few weeks ago on a Friday night to discover ONE server working the entire dining area. We ordered buffalo chicken potato skins and spinach dip. When our meal arrived (after waiting 20+ minutes) to be served the dip was burnt, the pitas undercooked and regular potato skins. When we told management that we had gotten something different than what we ordered his response was \"well we sold out of the buffalo chicken at dinner\". Well then please explain why your server failed to mention this while taking my order? I've never seen such disorganization before and even witnessed other families complaining that they had been waiting over 45 minutes to be served!!!! Never going back here again. This experience absolutely ruined Kelsey's for me"}
{"text":"We've been here twice over the last couple of weeks and it's been great. Service is good, friendly, chatty waitresses and no one seems in the least bit bothered about my baby making a mess with her food even though I've done my best to clean up! They're all super nice and quick. Food is good, well-priced, plenty of it, good kids menu and stuff to entertain kids who will colour in etc. Had a margarita the first time we came which was delicious although could have done with some more alcohol! :-) 
Overall I've enjoyed this place and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service at this location. The staff are always friendly and the food comes out very fast. Definitely the best option in the area if you are going to a movie and have time constraints."}
{"text":"Poor and slow service. 
Mediocre food. 
Don't recommend you eat here unless you you have very few other options."}
{"text":"So ... when then the waitress gets your order wrong, I would have expected some sort of compensation ... like maybe the entree being free or at the very least a coupon for a free appy on your next visit. Three stars because when I finally got the right order it was delicious. Not sure how quickly I'll be back tho. Something free goes a long way with me."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant, good service but very slow to process order. Waited 55 minutes after ordering and still no food. 

When we finally got two salads and a bbq chicken club. Food was average. A little disappointed"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went last nite before movies we ordered the salad with pine nuts and chicken an goat cheese

I was very disappointed the vinegar dressing was so very overwelming that it curdled my stomach and we'll needless to say we never  made it into the movie s as nothing stayed in my stomach 
We also ordered the shrimp with linguine noodles it was alright nothing to brag about server was nice timing was fine 
We have been here before an never had a problem with anything I think they have either hired a new cook and changed up menu 
K should have known as I asked what the lady next to me had ordered an before we got our order I watch her just push around the salad and just eat the chicken and left a complete serving of her dinner in the bowl they didn't not seem pleased an did not order desert or another beverage 
Very disappointed"}
{"text":"This was definitely the worst customer service I have received in a restaurant. Me and my girlfriend walked in at 5:30 in the afternoon ob a Monday and it wasn't busy. We waited for 5 minutes just for the host to seat us down.  We were ready to order but no one came to take our order. We waited for over 30 minutes and decided to leave because all the servers and other staff seemed confused and did not even try to help us. very disappointed experience."}
{"text":"Went in about a month ago to check it out after the reno. First impression will be my last impression. 

Got served by two managers, a server, and a hostess. Nobody knew what was going on and our order was taken more than twice. 

The atmosphere is not the kelsey's I have known and loved since I worked there 20 years ago. Very loud and open with some new age type music blaring. Could hardly hold a convo with my fiancee.

Ordered the three cheese dip (always a must until now) it is not the same dip I have gotten and loved for the same 20 years. I didn't like the looks of the new menu items so I went for my staple, the cracked peppercorn burger. Wow was I disappointed even further. New bun, patties (not the 1/3 lb.  patty anymore), mayo, cheese (grossest processed cheese I have ever experienced), and almost no peppercorns.

Got the bill and couldn't believe the cost for the quality (or lack there of) that we received.

Manager said they are trying to attract a newer younger drinking crowd. Congratulations it worked. I will never go to Kelsey's again."}
{"text":"I've been there a few times and found it to be to expensive, a burger and a couple of pints and your close to 50 bucks with tip that's crazy"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Went there last week with a group of 4 at 2pm. Got seated after couple of minutes. The restaurant was less than half full. After 20 minutes a waitress came to take the a simple order. Exactly after 20 minutes she brought the drinks. And exactly after 20 minutes after the drinks  our food came. The food was ok. While we were having our food all this time the waitress checked in on us only once. When we finished we have to go look for them to pay the bill.
So did you notice the pattern of 20 minutes, it was as if a timer was set to 20 minutes. So if you want to kill time and not hungry this would be ideal. And just want to mention that this is my very first review even though i have been to many many Restaurants in my life."}
{"text":"Awesome service from a man named Jt. Very attentive, friendly and honest. The steak and flatbread was good too :)"}
{"text":"Great location with parking. We have been coming to this Kelsey's for a while now because of 

- great staff that greets us at the door,the waiters that keep checking in from time to time during our stay

- delicious food from the menus

- tasty drinks"}
{"text":"Two visits, no issues. Quieter than Boston Pizza, Jack Astors, good for a decent bite and a beer."}
{"text":"Server Megan made the visit much better than my First visit.  Entrees still way overpriced- music was some obscure under 25 tape. Great pumpkin spice cheese cake."}
{"text":"Long long ago in a galaxy far far away Kelsey's simple offering was enough to warrant coming back and spending hard earned dollars.Unfortunately the basic menu and simple rooms no longer can compete with all of the new restaurants with there large menus and modern decor.

Food was fine nothing special.

The service was non existant."}
{"text":"Absolutely the most disgusting place I've ever walked into!!

This Kelsey's location used to be one of my favorite places and I visited it at least once a week. After this disgusting make-over, I decided to visit it to see the changes and I have never been so disappointed. 

The menu changed, the food is now disgusting (but price went up!) and this place is no longer related to Kelsey's in any shape or form. 

I am in my 20s and this place is NOT hip in anyway. I am also a designer. The interior is cheaply renovated with the most unappealing atmosphere. I usually welcome new changes and improvements. But, there is a difference between improving for the better and degrading a fine place for the worst. Not to mention the drastic change in target market - from family atmosphere to a supposedly hip place for people in their 20s. It's disgustingly loud, service is absolutely terrible. I don't blame the servers working there as they cannot even hear themselves, let alone their customers. First of all, it's does not please people in their 20s. second, it drove away loyal customers who used to happily line up for an hour outside to eat there every night. I no longer see filled tables, let alone lines."}
{"text":"Went here for a work party a few weeks back, total of ~10 people. It was late evening and it wasn't too crowded, we got a nice little booth to ourselves. I didn't notice anything off on the layout or decor like some other posters however...

THE FOOD
The majority of people did not like their food, one person sent it back but the rest of us just picked at our plates and ate what we did like. The spinach dip appetizer was good and that's about it. We also got the calamari and I was sorely disappointed.

I got the \"messy fish burger\" it had an awkward smell and tasted like frozen fish that was reheated, and done poorly. The best part about my meal was the pickle and I fond a little hair on that so I stopped eating. I didn't want to make a fuss because at that point others had complained about their food as well and I just wanted to head out.

The dessert was great though! They brought out the funnel cake fries (I believe?) for us because we had multiple birthdays as well.  Best part.

I didn't order any drinks but some others did, they liked their drinks.

SERVICE
My opinion on the service is mixed. When a coworker sent her food back the manager (I assume) -a male- came out to ask about it and he took it back no problems and with a smile. We weren't rude about not liking the dish and neither was he. We had two servers (the busser and waitress I assume) and we had both good and bad moments with them. I've worked in the food industry so I tend to let most things slide, especially since it was nearing the end of the day but one of the waitresses ignored some of our calls but later came back with a smile. The other got frustrated when bringing our drinks and giving it to the right people. 

The place looked nice and clean so those are the pluses. It's in a nice location (right across the movie theatres!) but I would not return simply because I didn't enjoy my food and found it overpriced at that."}
{"text":"I was seated at the bar side and there was only one waitress on this side so it was hard to flag her down. I ordered a few things to try out.

Spinach dip - the dip was ok, wish it was a little more warm but the deep fried pita chips were amazing. I actually wanted more of the pita chips, it was thick crispy, not like pita from pita bread.

Calamari - crispy, sauce was good but didn't realize the bottom of the plate was covered with the wonton chips so there were not that many pieces of calamari.

Asian sesame chicken salad - salad portion was small for charging $14 for it. There was good piece of grilled chicken breast on top with the sesame glaze, that was good. The Asian sesame vinaigrette was nice, just wish there were more salad to it. It would not be filling enough if that was all I ordered."}
{"text":"First review, ever, on Yelp or any other review/rating site, but felt it was necessary. First time here in many, many years, decided on it since it is next to theatres which we were heading to afterwards.

The service: Went with a couple of colleagues after work on Friday, arrived around 6:00 pm. The young host and hostess at the front desk were very pleasant, professional and accommodating. We were seated in the bar area in a booth.
We were being \"served\" by the bartender who really seemed like he did not want to be there, except to pick up his tips and pay check. Everyone has a bad day, but at least make an attempt considering your occupation. Whatever, we dealt with \"Mr. Personality\" for the evening.

The order: It took a good 45 mins to receive our main dishes. If it was a packed house I'd understand, but really it wasn't even full to capacity (no line up throughout the entire evening). A touch-base from our server (Mr. Personality) as to when our food would be ready would have been appropriate (nice). 

The food: Biggest disappointment!  Wow, I obviously wasn't expecting a five star meal, but I did order the $19. chicken fajita dish. I've had this dish at a couple of other mainstream restaurants in the past and always delish.  My dish: first thing I noticed was portion size - very small. What little onions and red pepper that were served, were barely warm and al dente; tortilla wraps stone cold; the chicken barely warm (usually this dish comes sizzling hot to the table which is one of the reasons I ordered it); side veggies/toppings were wilted and canned and jar-like). After waiting 45 mins I was looking forward to a decent meal. I can't comment for my friends' dishes but wilted salads, small portions and cold meat/potatoes is a brief overview.

Unfortunately, I will not be re-visiting this Kelsey's for a long time, if ever. I would not recommend to anyone. I think I am being generous with my 2 star rating."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went last Friday night. Atmosphere was great. Sat on the patio. He had a specialty beer and I a specialty drink. Both were very good. Our meals were delicious and came in good time. Our free cake oops were very yummy. Staff were very friendly. Very enjoyable evening out. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I have lived in Bolton for years and on occasion my wife and I elect to try the \"random\" quality of Kelsey's in Bolton as we did last week (Apr 15).  To sum it up... it was awful .  It started off bad.  We waited forever to even be noticed.  Once the server noticed we ordered beer, which took 15 minutes, we got the wrong order and,,, get this... they came in dirty glasses, how could the server not notice the finger prints and lipstick?  Once that fiasco was sorted out we tentatively ordered something simple that even a 10year old could handle..  Chicken fingers for me, and a Salad with chicken strips on top for my wife.  After 30 minutes of waiting that was also a remarkable disappointment ( we have been sitting for 60min by this time).  The chicken fingers appeared to have been recooked at least a few times and could have been mistaken for kindling wood, my wife's salad was so wilted and brown it appeared to have been put together a week ago and left on the counter in the warm sun, and the chicken strips were completely missing.    At this point all we could do is laugh at the pitiful state of this dining facility and take bets on how they could screw up dessert.  So we tried,  ordered the cheesecake, this could not possibly be a challenge as all they had to do is get a slice from the premade packaging, plate it and bring it out...incredibly, they got it right..  albeit, after 20 min.  The total bill was $60 for the 2 of us.  It was a pathetic experience that I will not soon repeat nor recommend.  It was cheaper than normal as my wife and I would typically consume s few drinks each and the bill would be closer to $100, this time 2 hours later and disappointed we went down the street for the rest of the evening."}
{"text":"Got there and waitress had attitude, waited 45 minutes for 2 meals, then after I was done my girlfriend pointed out a weird bug the size of a toonie  in my plate slowly moving around. I told her to get up and let's go and the manager tried to assure me that it didn't come from the kitchen..."}
{"text":"On Saturday night we decided to make reservations for my birthday - turned into a disaster . We wanted a table for 20. When we arrived I noticed my brother in law at a booth pretty far from our table , we were told that the people with kids couldn't sit at the high bar tables they had set up for us... My friend made the reservation and they told me that if we don't tell them there's kids going they don't sit you at a table for kids ??, is this not a family restaurant ?.. Anyways after 20 min of standing in the restaurant and having the servers act like we were such a inconvenience and in the way they finally got us a table. They had set up a row of bar tables and then a booth behind that table so the kids and their parents could sit behind us. It was awkward and I felt rude towards my friends who came for my birthday considering I had my back to them . We then had a rude waitress of coarse . She couldn't handle a table of 20 and was flustered just taking drink orders. When my sister in law asked for a drink she rolled her eyes , when we asked for a refill she said she \"isn't doing refills right now\" . Our food was good . No complaints about the food. Then for desert we weren't offered dessert menus at all. She quickly walked out to our table and handed me a bowl of chocolate something with breading ( she didn't tell me what it was) then said from Kelsey's for your birthday.. I want to just add that the table of 4 beside us got desert brought out and they sang . I was wondering why I was just handed it rudely and then I realized on a table of 4 tip isn't automatically added, on our table it was so that meant she didn't have to give effort for it. After talking a manager he offered a free entree for next time. I personally will not be returning to this location, so i said her tip should not be the amount that was added and my friend who was there is also a server for a diff restaurant and she also told the manager from her perspective. He took a item off our bill so I'm assuming the lazy waitress still got her 12$ tip from each of us .. She was awful . Zero hospitality . When we were leaving we were told from a miserable blond to please get out of the way of the servers desk which is placed literally right beside the door. So we rushed outside when she just rudely walked by didn't even stop at the waitress desk. She just wanted to be rude telling us to move.. 

This experience was so bad it should honestly be brought to higher management because If it were my restaurant I would want to know and make some serious changes."}
{"text":"Kelseys has been one of my main spots since forever. Our families been going for the past 10 years celebrating everyone birthdays there. They recently changed their menu which always brings surprises. I ordered the \"Big Daddy\" which is 2 patties with bacon + Mac and chess all under a sloppy joe. The sloppy joe was extremely delicious (it was the bun). My girlfriend got the half price wings since it was Thursday and they were just like any other place that serves wings. If you want something that is good enough then I'd try kelseys if you haven't before. (Get the Big Daddy) I wouldn't go super often though, just as a once in a while place."}
{"text":"Great chicken fingers, they give you 3 different sauces and 3 spices with the fingers and there all terrific. I got the chili grilly chicken and it was surprisingly good and very tender. Love the new look and love the new food. Also our waitress is very friendly, we where skeptical about their gravy and she just gave it to us for free to try out. And also we loved the apple butter BBQ sauce for the chicken fingers and she just packaged a couple small containers of the sauce for us to bring home. Will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"When I saw the picture of the Loaded Buffalo chicken potato on yelp, I had to come here. Unfortunately, they took it off the menu so we ended up having appetizers. The food was good and our server was attentive especially since it wasn't busy at all here."}
{"text":"What can I say.... I love Kelsey's, it's my favourite restaurant in this price range.

I'm a regular because the food is brilliant at competitive prices, and also because wings are half off on Thursdays. 

At this particular location I've found the service to be quite good and I rarely wait to be seated.

My only suggestion would be that they expand their beer list to mimic Fion Maccools."}
{"text":"I just went to this Kelley's at 230pm and stood in the entrance for almost 10 minutes. No one came to seat me, so I left."}
{"text":"I'm doing take out today but seeing the new and improved renovated Kelsey's is very nice to what I can see making it more of a upscale place to have dinner and enjoy a night on the town. I hope the place still has the same great taste with the new makeover"}
{"text":"Great food. 
Great service.
Friendly staff. 
Lots of working televisions showing different sports events. 

Average prices. 

Great location."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with my friend. The food was really decent but the service was good. I would only come here for drinks next i wanna come here. Its only nice to sit in the patio and have a few drinks but i wont try their food again!"}
{"text":"Not a fan of a few menu changes, the wings sauce seemed to change for the tangier side, and the chicken fajitas do not come with rice anymore, but what looks to be an entire bag of onions, (it was still good though). The staff are friendly but seem to have a lot on their plate because she seems to always to be in a rush."}
{"text":"Went here the other night as an alternative since our first pick was full. Normally I like Kelsey's but was quite disappointed with this visit. Though the staff were friendly, the service they gave wasn't the greatest. Not sure if they were understaffed or what but it certainly felt like it.   

First, we were seated at a booth that was missing a bulb so it was a little dark. Second, the waitresses were quick to try and get our order but once we finally decided what to have, our orders took forever. I like to give everyone the benefit of a doubt so I'm guessing the kitchen staff too were short. But then when our food finally came, it was disappointing. 

I ordered the chicken strips which were pretty small. Then my side of plum sauce was literally enough to dip their already tiny chicken strips, twice or thrice at most. Also the batter was way over cooked to the point that it was borderline burnt. With the strips, I got some sad looking pieces of carrot and celery. Definitely wasn't worth the $11.99. 2/5.

Calamari portion  looked generous at first until I realized they had added some chips that were camouflaged with the Calamari. They were at least good, though. Just didn't appreciate the illusion. The chips were under the Calamari which have it that fuller basket effect. 3/5.

Spinach dip was alright. Would've been nicer if it were actually warmer. 3/5.

So if you look at what we ordered above, you'd think that we would've gotten our order pretty quick, right? Nope. Again, we waited I'd say about 30mins for our food to arrive. On top of that, the dessert that came with the kids meal also took forever. 

As mentioned, staff were nice and I'm just guessing that they may have been shirt staffed. However the food quality was quite poor and not to mention the place needs to be updated a bit."}
{"text":"I was here on Valentine's Day for dinner. Not a long wait even on a busy day. My hubby got the Steak Sandwich, which he really liked and I got the Chicken Parmesan with Alfredo on the side. Alfredo was kind of tasteless, deff needed more cheese and the chicken was pretty small. Overall for the first time here it was pretty good. The atmosphere tottally feels like one of those after work places with friends/colleagues though, not a romantic date or a family place for me."}
{"text":"I recently visited this new renovated location as me and my friends were very excited to try the food for the first time! As soon as we got there as it was our first option for the night we were very excited for our food. We ordered 3 appetizers of Calamari, spinach dip, and nachos. The food took over a half hour to come as we didn't even see our waiter from when we ordered to when we got our food so it was impossible to even ask ANYONE for updates! At first we came very hungry and didn't even get our waters till after 15 minutes. After We got our food we were immediately disappointed. Our calamari was under cooked and tasted like rubber and you could not bite it without chewing on it till it was swallowable. The nachos were completely plain and cheese only covered 1/3 of it (as the description said \"loaded with cheese and beef) NOT EVEN CLOSE! Also, coming from a lover of spinach dip, beyond disappointed. It's very unfortunate that we had to go out of our way to ask for the calamari off our bill and our waiter wasn't even sensitive to the fact that our food was undercooked, ESPECIALLY FISH! GROSS! She rolled her eyes right infront of us and replied \"I'll ask my manager\" Coming from working in a restaurant myself, unexpectable behaviour, and quite childish to be frank. Growing up eating at this restaurant before the menu and owner changed was a much more pleasant experience. Definitely DO NOT recommend. I REPEAT DO NOT!!!!!!'"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service, quite decent food, prices rather high (especially for smaller plate of fajitas than they used to have).

The server was extremely helpful and treated my friend and I amazingly. She checked up on how our food was, and kept doing periodic table-checks to make sure everything was still good, referring water and what-not whenever required.

I did notice however that the size of the fajitas had gone rather down, yet the price had gone up. Not the fault of this specific location I suspect, but more-so a general Kelsey's thing, but I still feel it deserves dropping a star as not only do I get less bang for my buck, but I'm charged more for what used to come with a lot more for less.

All-in-all, based on the customer-service, I'd definitely return to this Kelsey's for another bite to eat."}
{"text":"Bad food 
Value zero
Price expensive
Ok service

Kids meal 3 strips were 1/2 size of nugget, 
Fajita trimmings were non existent.
Pasta cold and hard

Will not repeat"}
{"text":"Food was great and service excellent. I ordered the goat cheese and bear salad with salmon. The flavor was bursting!  Salad was to die for and what surprised me most was the salmon. Had a nice firm texture with an incredible smoke flavor. Would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"I used to love Kelsey's food a lot many years ago, I missed their crispy signature fries , however, seems like they now changed to something very plain and 'not so crispy' ones. (they look like those that sold in KFC, even worse than McDonald!) 
First of all, I went to this restaurant last Sun with my daughter, she ordered her kid's meal with pizza and Fries. This is my daughter's first time to say that the pizza isn't yummy!! I was surprised to hear that, so, I tried it, and I could tell that she was not kidding at all. I would never ever order a pizza in Kelsey's again. The taste is YUCK! 
I ordered a Grilled Chicken Cesar salad which is quite ok, but the French Onion Soup is super salty that I couldn't bear at all. 

The service is OK, but there is only our table that day at 12:30 noon, so, the waitresses were very happy to chat and chat in the corner near the kitchen. I was wondering why there is no customer except us on SUNDAY NOON!!?!?! There must be something wrong with the restaurant's food/service that no one comes on holiday?! 

At last, they even forgot to give my daughter a dessert which should be included in her kid's meal. I didn't notice that until we've got home.  

anyway, the food is no longer good compare with what I experienced few years ago. I am very disappointed though."}
{"text":"Nothing particularly exciting to state about this place. Food wasn't delicious but it was good. Where we were sat by the window was cold, so that wasn't enjoyable :) although I'm assuming the heating was on so unless there was just a draught by the window .. the desert on the other hand was delicious! I will leave the names of the dishes in the photos to follow the review! Waitress was lovely, no length waiting for food, free wifi, no trouble finding parking, nice and quiet during the week, tvs on inside to watch the basketball if needs be, bathrooms clean.. can't complain. Average sports bar!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place negative 10 stars... this place has got to be the absolute worst restaurant that I have ever been to!
My fiance and I came here for dinner on a week day after a great time at Niagara Falls, on our way back to my cousin's home in Toronto. 
When we first arrived here, we were waiting forever for someone to sit us. I wanted to leave right away but my fiance was complaining that he was hungry and so we just waited some more. This place wasn't even packed, I would say maybe 5 other tables were here... well a server saw us and eventually sat us (like maybe 15 minutes later).
After that, it took another 20 minutes for someone to take our order. Then we waited another 20 minutes or longer to get our food. We never got a refill for our beverages and I never found anyone to bring me a to go box to take my food home.
The food itself was a disappointment. Completely lacking in taste and flavor so I guess it was good thing that I did not take any of it home. 
The price is a rip off for the service and food (if you can even call that food) you pay. And of course again we waited another 20 minutes or so for someone to bring us our check. We should have walked out right then and there, but I don't want to be one of those people who do that and so we waited and waited. 
Later that night when we made it to my cousin's home, he told us that Kelsey's is known for pretty bad service, which did not surprise me. So save yourself the trouble and your taste buds and just keep on driving and find something else...anything else, because anything else would be MUCH better than here."}
{"text":"I have only given it a 2 because I have been there many times before and the service was way better then what we recieved last night. 
Came in for dinner during your usual dinner time hour. The hostess was really sweet but did she ever looked stressed... shrugged it off.. it's busy.. I get it. She seated us in the \"bar\" area and went off to service others.
We sat there, looked over the menus while waiting for our waiter to come... nothing... not even a ill be right with you. No one came at all to get our order...  after about 20 mins of listening to the bartenders friends bark out orders to her and getting completely ignored, we just decided to leave and take our business elsewhere. 
On our way out the hostess looked shocked and told us to have a great night, no young lady... you need the great night because that restaurant was a shit show that night.

Side note: I understand the bartender needs to watch how much alcohol is getting wasted and I understand the frustration of waste when drinks are made and not needed. What I don't appreciate is listening to you yelling at the younger waitresses about wasted drinks... yes defiantly, coaching is needed to correct errors but you dont yell at them in front of customers."}
{"text":"Had a pretty good experience here.  The location has been completely updated and has a very nice setting.  Lots and lots of booths!!!  Seating was comfortable and wait staff was attentive.

Upon our arrival with two children, we were received with hesitation as we requested a booth and a high chair.  There seemed to be concerns that they could not accommodate that despite the fact that there was plenty of room in the aisles.

The menu was good with lots of selection.  We ordered kids meals first and revived the adult meals first.  Kids had to wait, and I'm not sure why.

I would go back and would recommend this Kelsey's location for dinner or drink with friends."}
{"text":"Food took an hour to get to our table - came with incorrect sides. Very small portions. My burger patty was no bigger than a McDonald's hamburger. Expensive for what you get - you can tell the company is cost cutting everywhere they can. Service was slow. Won't be going back here - I downloaded this app just to write a review because of how bad the experience was. Save your money and support the local small businesses - I learned my lesson."}
{"text":"Shrimp fingers were too crisp and a bit bitter. Tomato penne tastes ashy and overcooked as well. Great 5-fruit soda and service. I would come back for the drinks, but food? Meh..."}
{"text":"Went here for drinks on a Saturday afternoon. Sat in the bar waited for someone to acknowledge that we would get service soon. No one came to our table. I had to go ask the girl behind the bar if we could get some service as we have been sitting there for awhile now. She looked confused! Another server came to our table and explained that the bartender was busy serving a section in the dining room. LOL. Really? I told her they shouldn't forget about people sitting the bar area. She brought us our drinks. No one came back to check up and see if we wanted more drinks. Had to go back to the bar to ask for another pint. Not impressed! Needless to say they didn't get a tip! Customers coming here to have a drink and spend their money shouldn't have to beg for service!"}
{"text":"Only 2 draft beer available! WTH! 
And they weren't good at all - because I can't remember the name of it. Pitcher was cheap though. Pass!"}
{"text":"Went here for a date. Was overcrowded and noisy, waitress didn't offer us a table or booth and just lead us to a table. My date and I would have liked a nice private booth, when I requested a change to booth she said we would have to go back in line and wait for another 20 minutes. 

The wait was a little long, but our drinks were brought promptly. My date enjoyed his dinner but my plate of Lobster and Crab Alfredo Linguine was absolutely disgusting. It was smothered in cayanne pepper to cover up how bland it was.There were TINY chunks of what I assumed were the lobster and crab, but you'd never be able to tell by taste because of the cayanne. It was served on a large, round, PLATE. It looked like a bowl and you were getting your money's worth, but in reality you were getting about as much pasta as a package of Mr. Noodles."}
{"text":"My wife and I dropped in for a beverage and a snack tonight after our movie. We decided on a 10-piece order of \"dusted\" chicken wings ($15.99... That's $1.60 per wing!) and an order of sweet potato fries, plus a glass of wine and a beer.

The restaurant was very busy, but we received our drinks fairly quickly. When the food arrived about 30 minutes later, the wings were barely warm, overcooked, and very dry. They had obviously been sitting under a heat lamp for a while.

It readily became apparent that the wings had been precooked at some time in the past, possibly days ago, then simply reheated and tossed in sauce. When I ordered \"dusted\" wings, I had no idea that they meant that the wings were covered in actual dust after sitting for who knows how long before being reheated and delivered to the customer. (Also, the bleu cheese dip has no bleu cheese in it, and obviously came from some no-name food service bulk container.) The dish certainly wasn't worth 16 bucks.

I should also mention that the young couple seated at the bar near us placed their food order, waited more than 20 minutes for their food, and were then told that the young lady's entree was not available, and that she would have to re-order.

Pfffft!"}
{"text":"I Just don't understand why the food at this location is way below average. I have convinced my self to try it 2 times and the 2 times we went there food was horrible! Their steak came rare though my husband asked for well done, the side veggies were so cold as they just tossed them into the pan right from the freezer. Their fajitas is nothing special, the beef fajitas also came rare even though we were not asked for our preference on how we like it to be cooked. The tortillas that are supposed to be steamy hot and fresh, came to our table cold and sticking to each others. Its ridiciulously bad quality food for the amount we paid. Never going back."}
{"text":"Brutal service !! If you love being forgotten about. This is the place !!  
Have wanted to leave 3 times so far.  
Decent food & drinks when they finally bring it to you.  
Paid at bar because waitress never came back. Manager gave my $ to the incompetent waitress who still couldn't make change. 
Total gong show. 
Waited & waited ... For everything.  
And it's only a Tuesday night w/ very few customers.  
Unless you maybe sit AT the bar on a dead night. Forget it."}
{"text":"I'm here from Windsor, on a business trip for work and needed a place to eat tonight for dinner. This Kelsey's is really close to my hotel in Burlington, my coworker and I made the decision to come here tonight for dinner. Walked in and was seated right away, and were asked if we preferred bar area seating or dining area; we chose the bar area, realizing after our table was pretty small, we should've chose the dining area, but we got great service nonetheless.

Our waitress was Katie, she was great, down to earth, friendly and took our drink orders and suggested one of the two sangria's to my coworker. I signed up for their offers and promotion emailing list and got a free spinach dip, what could be better? I ordered a diet Coke and some deep fried pickles as well. Within minutes our drinks came out and about 10 minutes after that our apps came out. We then waited a bit for her to take our order.

I ordered the Buff'd Up Chicken Caesar wrap, and it was suggested to me by a waiter at a different Kelsey's to have the sauce honey garlic instead of their regular medium sauce, and sweet potato fries, I was also offered the dipping sauce, which is 75 cents, but I wanted it anyway, which I wasn't offered at the Kelsey's in Windsor, so this was nice. My coworker ordered the Chicken Club Sandwich, which she said it was really good, as well as sweet potato fries.

We filled ourselves up on the apps, that we ate half our meal and she gave us take out containers, but we weren't offered dessert, which was fine, I was full enough already as it was. Katie was great! The neat thing about this Kelsey's is it being located in Oakville, yet my hotel is right across the street in Burlington. I was trying to check in using the app on my phone and I was looking for a Burlington address. It was a great night with food and company!"}
{"text":"We went there for dinner time. This is a chain so, Lets get to logistics of the place:

Location  is good as there is no parking problems. Restaurant is quite big and there is plenty of seating with various section and different seats available specially they also have kids seats and seats to place the new born car seat. 

Service was very good. We were greeted at the entrance, and seated fast. The server was knowledgeable and friendly. The size of the restaurant is good for large groups and families. Clean: The restaurant was kept clean and so were the washrooms.

Price was not bad and they even had an option for Dinner for 2 for $50 heal. We went for that as you were getting more for your bang for your bucks. Food wise as mentioned we went with the Dinner for 2 for $50 deal, which came with:

Shareable stater of Spinach Dip, which was rich creamy with blend of cheese, spinach, red pepper and onion. Served with pita chips. At this point I was already quite full. 

Choice of Entree, we both went with Grilled Atlantic Salmon. Fire-grilled and topped with house-made lemon dill cream sauce. Served with Yukon gold mashed potatoes and fresh veggies. The combination was very good and the meal was very enjoyable. 

The Shareable dessert we went with Brownie Pops. Brownies battered, golden fried and rolled in cinnamon sugar. Served with English toffee caramel sauce for dipping. At this point we could not finish this and head to take it home.

Over all the package was great and the whole experience from beginning to end was enjoyable."}
{"text":"I've had better, I think it's the same quality as Applebee's.  I ordered a chicken salad, the chicken fillet was rubbery, and the salad was drenched in dressing.

I would have appreciated Swiss Chalet more. But the good news is it's not that expensive, and I thought the decor was nice.

Seems more like a bar, because all their specials had to do with drinks."}
{"text":"It's a bit too bright to my liking - for a pub - but it feels cheerful and safe, by the same token. 
It\s a bit over-priced, but you know that you're going to get consistent service and consistent quality.
Last time I went, I ordered a 7 oz sangria - and was pleasantly shocked when I was served a 1-liter glass jar of sangria. Turned out the 7 oz refers to the amount of wine, and not the overall size of the drink :)"}
{"text":"This review has three parts, wait staff, food and support staff.
First wait staff was great, both waitresses were friendly and did a great job, we were very happy with the service we received.
Second food, it was ok but nothing great, it slightly below par compared to other pub foods.
Third support staff, this is kitchen dish washer in particular, they failed at their job miserably, most plates and cutlery were dirty and not washed properly, this made us regret going there and second guess if we should stay.
I really feel bad for the wait staff, they are the ones that deal with the customers and hear all the complaints. And I'm certain that more often than not it affects the gratuity they receive."}
{"text":"Competing with Boston Pizza next door this is just another Kelsey's sitting in the parking lot of a box store strip mall in the suburbs (can you hear the lack of enthusiasm in my voice?)

They have a patio for the summer, and the food is exactly what you'd expect. Kelsey's tends to be one of my least favourite of all the chain restaurants because just about everything they serve I could whip up at home with cheaper, fresher ingredients and with less salt and preservatives. However, one does not always get to choose the restaurant. 

Anyway, apart from my personal preference to avoid Kelsey's restaurants, going to this location won't bring any surprises (good or bad)."}
{"text":"Wonderful serve staff. Hostess looks like they just broke up with boyfriends or someone passed in the family. Foos is average bar food but this restaurant is definitely a leafs fan kind of restaurant. They prioritize leafs fans! Go to the bar for Aktar :)  hes very nice :p"}
{"text":"Longtime patron but obviously no management anymore. Horrible service. Somebody needs to get this place back on track.  Hoping that ownership will find a new manager. We waited way to long for even the basics."}
{"text":"I had a really good experience right from the entrance, host was friendly and we didn't wait more than 5 minutes to be seated. Although she could have sat us a little further away from the previous table she had just sat, it wasn't too much of a big deal. My eyes were constantly on the decor and how visual and beautiful it was inside. I loved the decor, and their food just as much. First time ever being to Kelseys so we had to try the Gigantic nachos as an appetizer. Let me tell you, it's GIGANTIC and says it serves 6, but us three merked that large plate  we are actually only going to do nachos at home this way. Because the cheese is so evenly spread through all the chips, instead of the mountain where the bottom chips are usually dry. Brilliant! We then ordered the chicken fatijas, all day breakfast burger and a chicken ceasar salad. They all tasted amazing and were presented in such a way that I cant even put into words. The plates had character, the way the food was placed had character. This was a restaurant filled with character and we loved it. Our server was so good, that we didn't even get his name. He topped off our drinks without us ever realizing we were low, napkins were provided, along with all the condiments possible, few check ins. Although we didn't get your name, we hope our tip was obvious of the great service you gave us. Washrooms \"pool\" were exceptionally clean and entertaining. The experience got way better, when I saw the manager (which unfortunately was her last day), she was one of my bosses from another restaurant we used to work at. At that moment, I knew the restaurant was in really good hands and it sort of all made sense how well the floor seemed to be managed, even though the kitchen and back area can be caos. I've heard of a few rumours of a Kelseys being opened in Newmakert and I hope it's true!
P. S although we didn't drink on this visit, there is a large selection of beer on tap, along with wine on tap."}
{"text":"I heard back from Kelsey's management.  Was impressed by their quick responses.  We will give you a try again!"}
{"text":"I had a mushroom burger which was excellent. I'm a carnivore and the burger surprised me! It was beyond delicious. I'm craving it we speak. The portion was an average size and$13.99 with a side. Unfortunately the service was lacking. The server we had was very nice and friendly but she forgot a few things we asked for like butter and ketchup. She also took forever to check in with us, we had to wait about 20 mins for her to refill our water and bring the things we asked for. It didn't seem that busy. I will try going to another location for the burger, hopefully service there will be better."}
{"text":"Took a look at my notes that I made over the course of my most recent visit here and realized I had an enormous review already here so here are my thoughts following my recent visit... 

Design amazing 5 star, this is a new muli-million dollar concept store for Kelseys. They've traded in their Brick, blue and red decor for something MUCH more modern. Sea-foam greens, fuschia pinks, bright blues on an aged painted white background - think a rustic surf house. Patio is a lot of fun to sit on AND the graffiti/old building look outside complete with single bulb light signs is very current. 

Service: 
Sadly, nothing has changed it's the same typical high school student spotty service 2.5-3 star. However they earn extra points here for management taking action without being asked when the steak was over cooked. They cooked a new one and took the item off my bill right away. However, I question if this issue was common because the reaction to my complaint was almost ahead of my words - it's like they knew what was coming and had a plan already. Curious....

Food:
*Appetizers* 
- Popcorn shrimp - Amazing. Cooked well, great portion size, great flavour -  
4 star
- Spinach dip - way too much cream cheese basically a bowl of cream cheese - 2 star

*Mains*
- Chicken fingers. Similar to the popcorn shrimp, not overly battered, evenly cooked, great presentation with 3 kinds of dipping sauce with corresponding dry shake. Very good - 
4 star
- Steak: A terrible cut of meat, had to be sent back once due to being over cooked and when I mention it to the server it was like she already knew this would be a problem. They cooked a new one and the new steak was cooked closer to what I wanted (medium as opposed to medium rare... Previously it came out well done) but still was an extremely chewy cut of beef. Eventually had to spit it out Bc my jaw hurt. My bad for ordering a steak at Kelseys, their bad for not knowing how to pick a good cut of meat or how to cook it -
1 star

Drink:
The Corona bucket deal is pretty good on the patio (3 for $9.99) and the Sangria pretty good albeit little too much triple sec - 3 star

Deals: 
I received coupons from them in the mail and the coupons included a $10 gift card. These deals were terribly deceptive, and terms and conditions were not outlined well in writing in an effort to get you in the door
- the 2 three course meals for $50 said nothing about what mains you could order turns out it was between 3, no choice on appetizer (had to order terrible spinach dip) had to order brownie bites for dessert. You basically save $3-5. We avoided that

- ordered the 2-for- 1 appetizer deal which was straight forward and we could choose any appetizer. Our bad for ordering the spin dip, next time I'd get the chicken fingers and shrimp.

However when we went to use the $10 gift card at time of purchase and we were told we couldn't use it since we had already used a coupon. Didn't say that anywhere on the flyer or coupon.

Overall.. you can polish a _____ but at the end of the day it's still a ________."}
{"text":"Stopped into the new kelseys in georgetown for a quick thirst crunch while doing a big shopping trip. They resignated one side with the same old bar feel and the restaurant is more fresh, open and trendy feel to it. They appear as if they are two different places. The bathrooms had a pool theme, bight aqua blue, the  swimmer's decor seemed out of place and not in line with the rest of the place.

I was surprised to see the newly renovated restaurant and revamped menu including el mucho burger, thai coconut shrimp salad and comfort foods like apple fritters. I was  pressed for time, so did not get to try the menu this time around, but I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Excellent service!  Great selection (even something different for the vegetarian in my party).  They have a great menu for allergens in the food, but were even able to alter a dish to remove my allergen.  Very attentive and considerate on that front.  (I love being able to go somewhere and not be a burden on my dining companions!)

The potato skins are always a treat.  GET THEM!  The fajitas were excellent and so huge!  Two people could enjoy one!  (This location's fajitas are larger than the one in Newmarket, so ask your server how large they are so you don't get too much/not enough food.)

Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"The new renovation is amazing. Everyone should come here and see it. They food prices have gone down the drinks are amazing and the place looks great. The outside porch is amazing with great booths outside. The food was great and nothing to complain about especially the Thai noodles."}
{"text":"Ordered wings and they were nothing special just straight out fried. Expensive compared to montanas across the street. Hubby liked his steak sandwich and broccoli soup. I found everything average. Wont go back!"}
{"text":"We went for dinner a week ago. I almost always get the same meal and so does my partner. Was not impressed with food this time.  It was dry and I could easily tell it's frozen food.  Definitely won't be going back. What a disappointment!"}
{"text":"I don't know what people are talking about. Went today with a friend for lunch. The decor is a vast improvement from what I remember of the old Kelsey's, albeit a little confused. 

We ordered calamari as a starter. It was very good and really generous portion wise. I ordered the lettuce wrap as a main and again it was very good. My friend ordered the lunch trio and it was a lot of food. Everything tasted fresh and came out quickly. Mondays is $4 corona bottles so we grabbed a couple.

The waitresses weren't chirpy which I find annoying anyways. But ours checked on us various times. Now it was lunchtime and rather empty which might explain the service but overall its still a vastttt improvement from the old dingy Kelsey's."}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday night and it wasn't too busy.

Pros:
- Nice ambiance
- Good service (Lindsay was great)

Cons:
- Pricey for the quantity offered
- Food was sub par
- No calories on menu"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying if I could give this place zero stars, I would have. Let's start with the drinks. I ordered a mojito and received a berry blended beverage with zero alcohol. Serving any drinks on a patio without any form of alcohol should be illegal. Second, I received my steak - which I ordered medium rare - was cooked well-done and slightly green/grey. And not in the good way. I'm sure my fellow carnivores can join me in a great gasp.. When I sent it back for a fresh one, the manager came out with my plate and attempted to defend the dish. Giving credit where credit is due, he did ask if I wanted something else. However, not wanting to make a scene with this guy, I opted to keep the dish. I left it on my plate to make a statement. Dessert came around and it was cold. Should have been deep fried deliciousness, however, came out as a cold uncooked mess. Ugh. Now, when our bill came to the table I was expecting the steak to be comped along with some sort of apology, however, the bill was full price and no apology. I'm never going back to this joke of a restaurant. I'd rather take my business to The Keg across the street."}
{"text":"Good food reasonable prices near the movies, what more can you ask for."}
{"text":"Spinach dip is amazing. Come here just for that.  Typical chain restaurant food, but it's decent. Nothing I've tried here was horrible. It was all great. Love their sandwiches, burgers, pastas. Wings are amazing. 

Not authentic, fresh made food, but it's good. What's there to complain about? Good food, close by, great for a night out."}
{"text":"This goes for every kelseys I've ever been to minus the one in Vaughn north of major mac on mccowan. Food is a god 4/5 but service is dodgy to say the least. Complements to the kitchen but training is much needed and hold your staff to certain standards"}
{"text":"Had supper there last night. Food was good I had the spinach dip as an App which was really good. My main I had the chicken Caesar buffalo wrap. The wrap was great was disappointed with the amount of fries received and that they were frozen not fresh. All in all I would go back again."}
{"text":"After craving a nice burger all week, my husband and I opted for Kelsey's. 

Interior is clean, with a big TV to watch the Leafs play in the playoffs. Staff were attentive, and service was prompt. 

I got the Burger 101, single patty. I was a little hesitant as all their other burgers only came with the double stack patty (didn't know if a single would be enough, but it was the perfect serving size!). My burger came with mayo, tomatoes, and red onion. The meat was nicely cooked, with a little char on the edges, just the way I like it. 

Hit my craving, very satisfying. I'd definitely stop by again. If you're a bigger guy who likes their meat - go with the double stack."}
{"text":"Great dinner and a movie place. Nice atmosphere and your choice of dining or bar area. Lots if tvs scattered around for the sports fan. Very friendly staff and the menu is different than your typical restaurant of this caliber. Try the Reuben spring rolls."}
{"text":"I liked my dad's salmon with the lemon dill sauce, my mother got the thai soup on the summer menu.  Her soup was super good, while my broccoli cheddar was average.  Not too bad all around.  We all enjoyed the bruschetta appetizer.  Cheers!  Decent value with the 10% off coupon from our hotel."}
{"text":"After going to the movies, we grabbed a bite here. It wasn't busy and we were seated quickly by a cheerful hostess.

And then we waited. It was 10min or so before we saw the server for our section who apologized profusely for the delay. We ordered Steak Fajitas for 2. We said we wanted the steak done medium.

He brought the tortillas and toppings, but it was only a serving size that would come with a single serving of fajitas. They should bring 2 bowl of toppings to save the server another trip. Oh well. At least the toppings were fresh!

It arrived well done. We didn't complain. There was no seasoning on the steak at all. It was tender, but no flavour. There were fried onions and orange peppers with the steak, enough onions for 2, not peppers. The steak was on a bed of fried rice that was quite yummy. Makes me wonder what the size difference between the 2 looks like.

Meh."}
{"text":"I'm not a total fan of their food. I usually come just for drinks. Their spinach dip is really good too. But I find their other food so bland. However they really redeemed itself when I had their Nutella Donuts. Holy moly I was in heaven. They were warm pillows filled with Nutella goodness. I didn't care for the dip with it and honestly it doesn't need it. It was a perfect way to satisfy my craving. I hope they keep it on the menu because when I have those days I'll definitely be coming here for that. I did see some other cool things on their new menu and maybe I'll give it a shot. My friend got the funnel cake fries but I didn't like the chocolate sauce they used and it didn't have that same great taste you find at wonderland. My girl got a Caesar and it wasn't too spicy for her which she loved. I would recommend asking it a bit hot if you like spicy"}
{"text":"We went here after driving around for over half an hour.

SERVICE:
After declining to be seated in the bar area, which they asked everyone as they waited to be seated, we were seated in the southern area of the restaurant. We figured out quickly that they were sitting families on the southern end, and older adults and seniors on the northern end. Therefore we were sitting among young, loud children. 

The first waiter took her time in getting us drinks and taking our food order, as we mentioned that we were not in a rush for a movie. She did not return, as when our appetizer came, she started serving two large groups of 10+ people, and a male waiter had our appetizer in hand. Neither came back to ask us how we were doing. The male took our plates when we were finished and gave us our bill.

FOOD:
The appetizer we ordered was the \"Four Cheese Spinach Dip.\" It was really good - full of flavour. The \"fried pita chips\" that were mentioned on the menu were actually slices of warmed-up pita.

Mains:
1. Thai Curry Chicken Fingers - the menu mentioned that it came with red peppers, green onions, coconut, and green chili sauce. When it came to the table, there was no onion, and the coconut looked like melted cheese (on first taste though, it was definitely coconut). The other problem was that the chili sauce was only on the red pepper, therefore there was a limited amount. 

WARNING: This dish does not come with a free side. I added Sweet Potato Fries which was an additional $3.99.

2. \"No Meat\" Portobello Burger (gluten-free bun requested) - the mushroom was fried, therefore losing the great natural flavours. The goat cheese, red pepper, spinach, and aioli were limited, and if you removed the toppings from the bun, it was not even a lunch-sized salad. The bun itself was huge for the number of ingredients inside and it looked unappetizing. This dish came with a free side. The fries requested had too much potato.

THE BILL:
The male waiter said that he would remove the burger from the bill due to the issues discussed above. When the bill arrived, it had not been removed. We paid the bill and left a low tip.

NOTE: For those who keep strictly Kosher, the options are quite limited, so read the menu carefully. I had thought of getting the Balsamic Chicken, but the balsamic part was a cream sauce."}
{"text":"FOOD POISONING!!!!! 

I would give negative stars if I could. 

Had the salmon entree at this location and was VERY sick with food poisoning. 

Called them and was hung up on.

Wrote an email and did not receive a reply.

Only received a tweet back on twitter saying they would look into the matter and of course they did not and have not heard back.

Will never eat at another Kelsey's location again, nor will anyone I know if I have anything to do with it!

Terrible food, very subpar service and VERY UNCLEAN restaurant in general.

They should do themselves a favour and close this chain all together."}
{"text":"I came to this location to meet someone and to have a quick drink. We didn't order any food so I can't comment about that. We sat at the bar and the service was prompt and attentive.

This Kelseys is located in a huge plaza by Main St. and Bovaird in front of the Five Guys and Fortinos. This place has a nice upscale d√©cor and it looks like is brand new or has been recently remodeled. Prices are in line to this type of establishment as I wouldn't consider it to be cheap.

I'll probably come back to try out their menu.

Recommended."}
{"text":"Dirty , waitresses look like they hate their job, fruit fly epidemic ! Food was disgusting !!! Don't go there !"}
{"text":"Not bad Kelsey's, Not bad!
I have to mention for this location (not sure abut the others) they really stepped up their game within the last couple of months. 

My boyfriend and I came here for lunch and first thing we noticed are a bunch of limes at the side of the building sitting in the snow, the reason i'm mentioning this is because people could easily slip on them. The whole time we we're there till the end, the limes were still outside, no one cleaned them up. 
Anyway we we're greeted and seated and our server introduced herself. I got to say Kelsey's has a very inviting bar area. They also have pretty good specials. My boyfriend ordered one of the burgers called stack of something and it was on special for 9.99 +fries and i ordered the messy fish sandwich 12.99. 

The food looked ssoooo good when it arrived to our table. I ordered the messy fish sandwich before but it was never this good, the batter was perfect crunchy and not detached from the fish at all. It was a really good amount of fish and IT GETS REALLY MESSY. but its so worth it. I loved it
my boyfriend said he really enjoyed his burger, there was a lot of burger juices coming from it. good sign !! Also a couple  months prior we ordered the loaded nachos which were THE BOMB and battered calamari which i thought was a little tiny bit on the salty side. ALL in ALL I feel better about coming to Kelsey's now and they really do have a good menu and atmosphere.

The only thing i was not happy with which isn't a problem and most places do this, and have to stop is auction off food. We came for lunch they were not busy at all we are only 2 people so there is no reason you have to ask which order was whos. it should be easy to remember."}
{"text":"Was very impressed. Got the chicken fajitas and the potato soup they have and it was hot and FRESH ND super delicious. Would Definitely go again and would highly recommend. Place to go for sure!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I went here because I was given a gift card for Christmas, having not been to a Kelsey's restaurant in years. I was expecting average-to-good food and fast service. It was not the experience I thought I was going to have, I was actually pleasantly surprised by the service, but I think overall the food quality keeps the rating at a solid 3 stars. 

I ordered a steak with shrimp while my date ordered a pasta dish. I was handed the wrong steak dish, so the waitress promptly took it back and offered to make me a new dish. I was a bit sad about having to wait, especially with my date's food getting cold in front of me, but I'm a fairly patient and understanding person and was okay to wait. During this time, multiple servers asked me if I wanted a snack on the house while I waited, offered to keep my date's food warm under the heat lamp, let me know that because of the mix up my meal was on the house, and checked in to make sure I was doing okay. I was thoroughly impressed with how we were treated in this situation. The food was what I expected...average or perhaps slightly above average. my steak was a bit well done (but I actually don't mind it that way), the mashed potatoes were tasty, but the side of veggies were pretty bad. The white chocolate cheesecake dessert was very tasty. Their beer selection was very average.



The whole parking lot down there is a total mess, during the weekend dinner rush it is near impossible to get a parking spot. You have to a do a bunch of laps and stalk any pedestrians you catch walking to their cars. Not that this is the restaurant's fault, just warning anyone thinking about driving down there on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Hadn't been to Kelsey's in a few years but my experience here was sub par. The food was great, but our server was less than great.

When she arrived to take our order, the person I was with ordered an iced tea, and I ordered water, plus our dinner choices. A moment of silence from our server preceded her laughing and saying \"sorry, I totally wasn't listening! What would you like\"  UHHH? At least she was honest and admitted she was in another time zone when we ordered, but it was rude none-the-less. The only redeeming factor was that she heard us correctly the second time around and brought us the correct drinks and food. 

I suppose she saw my reaction to this, because after we got our drinks, we had a different server bring us our food and check up on us throughout the meal, while she busied herself with other things. Our second serve was a nice guy, checked on us regularly and was pleasant to chat with. 

The reason this location did not get a higher score from me was strictly based on the first impression our initial server left me. Other than that, great food, great atmosphere"}
{"text":"I had a really bad experience at this location just tonight (Saturday at 10 - 11pm) and unfortunately there was no reason for it since it was pretty quiet and I saw multiple servers.

Our server had a bit of an attitude from the very beginning unfortunately as she wasn't cheerful, happy and almost acted as we were wasting her time. 

We ordered our drinks and they easily took 10 minutes to get to our table. We only ordered waters and iced teas so it wasn't like we ordered mixed drinks... 

Our food took a long time which I thought was off since I actually just ordered soup, someone ordered a wrap and another ordered fish and chips. 

When it finally came and sat for who knows how long since one of the people with went to the washroom and saw it just sitting there while our server talked to another server... 

My soup was awful... It was seriously the worst soup I have ever had. Don't order the chicken bacon corn chowder. It was just corn.... Tons and tons of corn. It didn't have much of a creaminess to it and it really felt like something you would find in a slop for barn animals. 

The other people mentioned their food was alright and the fish and chips looked great... but we couldn't believe that our server didn't even bother to come check on us, the awful soup... Or give us ketchup/vinegar... Anything. 

We got refills right before we paid out bill even though they were empty pretty much before the food got there due to the long wait. 

Forget about how many times we had to ask for the bill. We actually got up and just stood there waiting at one point as our service was still doing her disappearing act. 

Next time we are definitely just going to wait for Jack Astors to have a table... Two thumbs down big time."}
{"text":"Arrived at the movies too early (a little too excited for the new resident evil movie), so decided to grab some food.  We were seated in the bar section which was great for Sunday night football.  The bartender was our waiter and he was super laid-back and friendly.  I ordered the Asian Sesame SHRIMP salad.  You can have shrimp or chicken.  When the food came, they had given me chicken on my salad instead of shrimp.  I'm vegetarian so I had my friend ask to send it back (which was painful, I hate being whiny about my food).  The shrimp arrived on my salad and everything was right in the universe.  Unfortunately, I've had this (delicious) salad at another Kelsey's location and this one did not compare.  The portion was smaller, the ingredients were not as fresh and it was not as visually appealing.  Good salad better at other locations."}
{"text":"I've dined at this location a few times & the service is great. Special mention to Kim & Andrea as well as Rob in Management. They are good at making suggestions and bring you any extras you may need (like dipping sauces). If you sign up for Kelsey's emails you get the delicious Brownie Pops free!  The wings are wonderful & portions on entrees generous. Thx!"}
{"text":"Came here on New Year's Day at 12:00 p.m. We were the only ones in the restaurant, allowing us to be initially served quickly. However, as things started getting busier around 12:30 to 1:00 p.m., it was rather difficult finding our waitress to request our waters be filled and to order dessert. 

MAIN (Lunch Menu): 1/2 Pesto Flatbread and Garden Salad

The salad was okay - nothing particularly special about it. A minor detail that I did appreciate was the fact that they placed the dressing on the side as opposed to on the salad. It's not uncommon for salads to be overdressed at times. However, I was disappointed with the flatbread. I was expecting a warm fluffy dish, but instead, the flatbread was extremely crisp - almost like a very thick, crispy chip. Though the bread itself was not great, the toppings (tomatoes and cheese) were fresh and light."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday at 6:30 p.m. I was seated almost immediately, and while it was very loud in the restaurant, the service was exceptional! Our waiter was as personable as it gets - he quite literally danced his way to the table to take our orders and serve us! 

MAIN (Limited Time Menu): Warm Spinach Salad *recommend*

I've eaten quite a few salads at restaurants (my friends can vouch for me), but this was probably one of the BEST salads I have ever had. The portion size was good, and the warm cheese coating the spinach and chicken pieces were divine!

The photo included in this review is of my friend's dish, which includes the bacon bits. I ordered mine without the bacon bits (I'm not a huge fan of bacon) and found that it was still so delicious! The cheese and well-seasoned chicken provided this salad with great flavour!"}
{"text":"I was in the area for work and this is the only place with American food I could find. I arrived around 7pm and it wasn't not very busy at all, since I was by myself I sat at the bar. The bartender was nice and got my drink order right away. I was having a tough time with my dinner decision but I settled on the Sweet Tai Chili wings, which was a mistake. If you are going to eat here, don't get the wings. They are small and have barely any meat on them. The wings are also breaded, which I don't prefer but I can deal with. The sauce was fine, but I couldn't get past the size and lack of meat on the wings. Since I was still hungry after my meal I ordered their cookie and ice cream desert and I rarely eat desert. This was actually pretty good but you need at least two or three people to eat it. Overall it was a nice place, I just picked the wrong menu item."}
{"text":"This was a horrible experience.....will definitely not be back. I pass this newly modeled location every few days and have been curious for months....now I know. 
Visited on a Saturday evening, around 5:30 before a 7pm movie. The place was busy but it wasn't crazy. We had three adults and 2 kids, but all ordered adult entrees. The food was only lukewarm when it came out, pretty flavorless and seemed like corners were cut where possible (seemed like frozen chicken breasts used for salads, premixed sauces for pasta), ....and the service was terrible. Never an offer to refil drinks, just short one word answers, a lot of \"sighing\" if someone asked a basic question like \"can I get the salad dressing on the side please\". Seemed to be about the same level of service at other tables too. Don't waste your time, money or a meal. It may seem like the best option especially pre-meal, but go across to Stoney Bread or just eat in the theatre, at least it may be a hot meal."}
{"text":"WAHHHH! This year, I GAVE UP NACHOS FOR LENT!! This also means I refrained from eating any type of tortilla chip including Doritos. On Easter Monday, I ended up here with a friend and of course wanted to devour nachos as my reward for not eating any for forty days... Unfortunately, Kelsey's nachos didn't hit the spot. I only made a tiny dent in the dish. I'm almost certain it was the ground beef topping... My tastebuds were turned off by the marinade and in my mind, I was already planning a future redemption nacho meal as I hesitated picking on the nachos in front of my face.

We sat in the bar area which wasn't busy, so I'm not sure why it took 20 minutes after my nachos were cleared, for me to flag someone down to order dessert. (Yes, I had to flag someone down!)

Overall, this visit wasn't horrible, but there is definitely room for improvement. I live close by so I'm sure they'll have another chance to step it up. Plus now I know not to order the nachos and hopefully eat enough to skip dessert..."}
{"text":"I received a letter from a manager, Krishia, who was very kind and understanding about the situation. She offered me and my friend a chance to return and give the restaurant another try on the house.

My friend and I finally were able to go a few days ago and it was definitely a much better experience. Our server, Alisa (?) was friendly and warm and really seemed to care about customer experience. She even advised when I asked that the dish I was asking about wasn't one of her favourites and made some solid suggestions for alternate choices. 

The manager who wrote the letter also appeared at our table and we were able to chat face-to-face, and I appreciated that a lot, too.

All in all, I think I would return to this restaurant again given management's desire to provide training to its staff, and for being generous with us as potential customers. 

Also -- a tip -- there's this \"Gimme Grilled Cheese\" dish that is grilled cheese with bacon and mushrooms and.. oh man. It's REALLY good."}
{"text":"Been coming here off and on for last 6 years. 
Always fine service and food. 
The new face lift of the restaurant is minimal but nice."}
{"text":"My daughter and I had an early dinner here today. First time we had visited since all the renovations. We were actually looking forward to see all the changes etc. The food was good but the service needed some renovations.. e.g.. We were deciding whether to have breaded or non breaded wings so we pointed to the pic of the yummy wings in the menu and asked what kind those were. Server says..\"I don't know. It's just a picture\" . Aritey then. The worst part for me however was when the server brought over the take away containers and one fell to the ground under the table. She picked it up and handed it to me. I just stared. She said \"That's okay right?\"  Yeah so maybe not for me again."}
{"text":"This time around the gang headed to Kelsey's at Highway 7 & Woodbine for dinner. Kelsey's needs no introduction. Think Boston Pizza. Think sports bar. Think American food. Think drinks. This location had plenty of seating, good lighting, and an overall cool atmosphere; what you would expect from this chain.

Our group of 12-15 came in after working out most of the day, so appetites were strong. We started things off with their flat pan nachos. A friend had previously told me that the dish was substantial in size, but I wasn't quite expecting the big boy serving that came to the table. Have a look at the photo, but for perspective, four of us split the platter, and we were more than satisfied as far as an appetizer goes. As for toppings, the three colour tortilla chips were covered with three cheeses, Roma tomatoes, onions, ground beef, beans, and we had salsa and sour cream on the side. (We requested the jalape√±os on the side too, but no luck there.) The nachos weren't just sizeable, but they were plenty tasty as well. That being said, I would have preferred if the ground beef was a little more manageable so that it could be more easily dipped with the chips. We had to use a little elbow grease, and eventually a fork, to pry away that meaty delight. 

Hopes were high going into the main course, (considering the good experience we had had with the nachos), but the good times just can't last forever. The folks immediately surrounding me and myself all got burgers. I personally ordered the All-Day Breakfast. The sandwich comes with smoked bacon, cheddar, lettuce, tomato, a hashbrown, and a sunny side up egg. If you're thinking, \"those ingredients sound delicious!\", you would not necessarily be wrong, but this burger sucked away that enthusiasm along with any moisture it may have had. I.e. it was very dry. Not even the sunny side up egg could rehydrate the meal, especially since it was a little too far done. The same sentiment goes for the rest of the group who got burgers.

So where do I fall on Kelsey's? If you're going to relax and watch the game with a plate of satisfying nachos and some drinks, you've found your home. If you're looking to appreciate a first rate meal, at least as far as my group goes, you'll probably want to try your next dinner option.
I will say though that the staff is very helpful, prompt, and friendly."}
{"text":"I had pretty low expectations for the food and the general atmosphere here especially after reading the reviews. I have a problem with super loud places and asked to be seated in maybe a booth or somewhere that may be quieter, the hostess seamed a little flustered but she looked around and made sure a corner table was okay with me, very accommodating. Our server was Brittney and she made excellent recommendations that we went with which was the chicken parm sandwich, and the messy beef sandwich both I would eat again! Again out server told us they make the beef sandwich is better in the morning because that's when they make it, so anyone who needs a great messy beef sandwich go in the AM. Fries and gravy were cold, I sent back the fries and they re-fried them which personally doesn't bother me. Everyone that we came in contact with was super nice. The only thing was I think the music was just too loud, not a good conversation place. Almost forgot the Nutella fritters! I took them home and even cold they were so good, if you like Nutella, you need to have these things, just be prepared to share! Yum!"}
{"text":"Had dinner with my friend today and our eyes were bigger than our bellies lol.

We ordered 2 apps...spinach dip and calamari which were really good, I would definitely recommend those.  I think the calamari would have been better with a different type of dipping sauce.  It came with like a cocktail type of sauce, but it might have been better with like a creamy sauce like tartar or chipotle.  But I'm just a sauce person lol

For our mains...I got regular wings with medium sauce on the side.  My friend had chicken fingers.  My wings were good, nice size and nicely breaded.  My friend liked her chicken fingers, but in comparison with Jack astors, JA takes the win so she wasn't completely satisfied.

Our server was pleasant, checked in on us and was polite.  Thanks for a nice dinner!"}
{"text":"Can I give them 0 stars?  Atrocious professionalism and service.  Received luke-warm fries, luke-warm garlic bread, server was giving more attention to cleaning her bar wine glasses, on the phone for 5 minutes right in front of us while our daughter was waiting for a fresh cup of water and when I reminded her she points at the phone as says \"I'm with a customer\".  Asked for the luke warm garlic bread that was served us to be warmed up, thought I was being nice.  Wrong - they take 20 minutes and after our meal is done brings it out and puts it in front of us.  I tell her we are finished our meal already and want the garlic bread removed from the bill and get the eye roll.  We then wait 15 minutes in a nearly empty restaurant while the 'manager' \"removes the item from the bill\" only to get it and see 50% removed.   Can we say unprofessional retaliation? I hope you enjoyed your 0$ tip, you deserve it and I would not recommend your restaurant to my worst enemy."}
{"text":"Kelsey HUDGE 7 layer burger 3 cheese carmelized onions - good beer - great sports - life is good this is attached to the HI."}
{"text":"Probably my best Kelsey's experience. I got there very late, I think 30 minutes before closing.   We didn't get seated and was the only ones left in the whole restaurants, so we felt really bad. I went with friends and we quickly ordered. 

The people there was so nice though, nobody rushed us into ordering and they kept checking in if we were okay. Whenever they ran out of a certain ingredient they did a great job in telling us before hand. 

We ordered 3 desserts, the cookie sandwich, the funnel cake fries and the white chocolate cheesecake. Since there was no chocolate ice cream, something we were looking forward to, the waitress added extra Chocolate syrup onto the vanilla ice cream. She made a happy face and everything, she was so sweet. Everything was super yummy, best when you're craving some sugar.

 Everyone kept telling us to take our time and that they'd let us stay even if it kept them back. We felt so welcomed."}
{"text":"Went with group of friends.  The waiter seemed pushy to sell us on drinks and desert even though we were not interested.  Ordered the bacon burger.  The burger was average nothing special from a chain with obvious fillers in the meat.  Overall not impressed but really not much to expect from a chain."}
{"text":"I go to Kelsey's rather infrequently - I have been to this location twice in the last 3 years.  The service was really amazing and attentive.  We got seated in the table and chair region, which sucked to say the least.  We were beside a ginormous birthday party and a pair of teenage girls.  The average patron age was about 17 or so.  It was extremely noisy. 

The food was pretty blah...maybe I remember a time when chain restaurants were always amazing and you could always depend on them.  We had the 7 layer dip and were not overly impressed.  I had some wings that were pretty good, a little over smothered with sauce.  My boyfriend had the buffalo chicken sandwich and did not like it, I thought it was fairly good.

In the chain world, I'd go elsewhere if given the opportunity to eat here again.  There are a few others down the road at Sherway."}
{"text":"What did you guys do to the fries?! The fries taste like they were left out after frying and then re heated in the microwave. Everything else is good."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday and there was a promotion going on where several of dishes were being offered for $11.99. I ordered the Peppercorn Burger and it was surprisingly really good! The double patties were nicely grilled and flavorful, the pretzel bun was definitely a step up from regular burger buns, and the onion rings were nice and crispy. I was pretty confident when ordering it that I would be able to finish it but I really underestimated the burger.. It was super filling so I ended up giving away half of my fries.

The night wasn't too busy and the overall service was good. The waitress was friendly and attended to our needs.

I probably wouldn't come for regular price ($17ish) but it was definitely worth my money for $12."}
{"text":"The Hubster and I found ourselves here for an impromptu date yesterday. We had originally planned to dine at the much classier Imperial Buffet, but the lineup was a little too crazy.

Service was fine, though a bit slow. We were seated at the bar and I got the feeling that the dining room was busier than anticipated. The bartender would run in, make some drinks for the rest of the place, then run out to deliver food, then back in. 

I got the rib and wing combo, and the Hubster got some chicken wrap. He really really enjoyed his chicken wrap and I was pretty happy with my meal. The ribs were fall off the bone, and pretty tasty, and the wings were actually spicy, but a little soggy. The cajun kettle chips were pretty good.

The bar area was a good spot to watch a couple of football games during dinner.

Altogether, it was your regular Kelsey's experience. Decent service, decent food at an OK price."}
{"text":"Their Girls Night Out special is amazing. 2 snow cones and 2 appetizers for $20. If that's not a steal I don't know what is. Their staff are super friendly and the atmosphere is fantastic. I go here every week for their special!
Their drinks are so good! I get a different one every week! Definitely recommend for small groups or big!"}
{"text":"I thought that this was going to be an updated review, but it looks as though I haven't reviewed this place before. In any case, my recent visit to Kelsey's proved that people (or places) can in fact change for the better over time. Previously, Kelsey's would be the first restaurant I'd name as an example of boring chain restaurants that only serve reheated frozen food. I remember visiting a Kelsey's years ago and remarking how it would've been cheaper to just buy the same items in the frozen aisle at the grocery story and eat at home. But now they've abruptly changed that perception and approach.

This location (and others which now have the \"Roadhouse\" included in the name) has undertaken some major, and much needed renos. They've done a good job, and I'll give them points for having a relaxing decor approach. More importantly, their menu and approach to ingredients are completely changed for the better. They've been advertising that burgers and other items are fresh and not frozen. 

I don't know whether the 'fresh' approach applies to every item on the menu, but I can say that the fish in my \"Messy Fish\" sandwich was almost certainly breaded in house (though it like virtually all fish, the fish would've been flash frozen previously). The fish was comparable to any reputable fish and chip place you can think of, in the same preparation and served on a fresh bun with coleslaw and tartar sauce. The fries were fresh-cut too and miles ahead of what they used to be. I'd almost rate that dish a 5 star.

The kids shared a pizza from the kids menu. I can't comment on it much, but they really went for it and it seemed better quality than kids pizzas you'd find elsewhere (such as Swiss Chalet).

My wife just wanted a chicken caesar. Here is possibly where the jump in quality wasn't as apparent. Nothing terribly wrong with it, but a very standard Caesar salad, with a pretty generic dressing. The lettuce was far too cold. The chicken was pretty good however.

Kelsey's is still is a chain, so don't come in expecting a premium, downtown 'gastro-pub' experience. With that said, based on my experience at this and another \"Roadhouse\" incarnation, they've moved from a sad and slowly dying chain, to a vibrant place that I'd be more than happy to return to and recommend."}
{"text":"Fairly standard chain Kelsey's restaurant. For Americans, this is very similar to a Red Robin or Applebee's - having lots of comfort/friend foods and a standard bar. They have a large bar area with TVs to watch a couple games. The beer is the basic domestic stuff you would expect out of a chain like this. 

The burgers are fairly standard, what I enjoy the most out of places like this in Canada is that you can always get a side of gravy with any meal. My main complaint is that healthy food choices are poor by my standards so I usually go with a sandwich of some sort. Overall, its a safe spot to eat for consistent bar food."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the worst Kelsey's establishments I've ever been to. We've gone twice now, and had terrible experiences each time. The first ended up with my wife getting food poisoning from undercooked chicken, the second time the waiter forgot to enter our order and then blamed it on a malfunctioning printer. I'm sorry, if it was just a printer malfunction, then why do you need me to tell you my order again? In your computer, should it not already be in there if you entered it previously? I used to work at a Kelsey's back home 20 years ago, and they had the technology then. On top of all this, the manager didn't even come out to talk to us. Terrible. Better service and experience at mcdonalds. At least there you get your food, and a smile."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here on Sunday night for dinner.  The place was not busy however the food took a very long time to arrive. I have listed below some of the pros and cons of this place.

Pros:
Great customer service from the servers
Nice interior/atmosphere

Con:
I was swerved RAW CHICKEN in my Thai green chilli bowl.
When they sent they sent the plate back to be remade they rushed the order and my the new plate had most of the vegetables uncooked. 

I was eating chicken with very over cooked noodles but very raw broccoli and bok choy.  It was horrible and we received no other compensations for it. 


I rate"}
{"text":"I went cuz it was cheap. half Price wing's on a thursday.

Giant wings which are waaaaay to breaded. Not horrible but nothing way too impressive. $5 mojito was not a bad touch either."}
{"text":"Food was fair.  It looked really good!  I had a chicken Caesar salad and my guest had a burger.  He loved the burger and the home cut like fries were tasty.   The chicken was tender and real and the salad was good enough.  Service was a bit slow but the server was friendly. She was young so she didn't have too much input on questions on the menu. It wasn't bad overall. I would eat there again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"I'm kind of bias towards this Kelsey's because I know the people that work here and also because the boyfriend used to work here.  None the less, this is one of the best Kelsey's I've ever been to, as I've had horrible experiences with other Kelsey's locations.  I've come here numerous times and most recently I came here to watch the Raptors Home Opener.  I started with their drink special of the day, which was their Beer-ita, which is a \"the best of both worlds\", blended Tequila margarita topped with an upside down icy cold Corona.  Always good to have daily drink specials at a restaurant.  We ordered our traditional Spinach Dip (which might I add, that I am addicted to!) and I like to be a bit different and order my pita chips half baked and half deep fried, just to give it some variety.  Obviously, the deep fried tastes better but when you eat baked pita chips you feel healthier.. Definitely recommend this appetizer.  We also ordered the Calamari which usually comes with a seafood sauce but we also asked for Sweet Chili Thai sauce on the side.  Their Calamari is mediocre to me, nothing special.  To name a couple of other dishes I've had here, we've had the Buffalo Chicken Potato Skins (which I thought were pretty good, the boyfriend wasn't that much of a fan), Wonton Nachos (which aren't as good as their original tortilla chips), their wings (which I definitely recommend with whatever sauce you desire), Messy Fish Sandwich (one of my favourites and always a go-to), the \"HOLY BLANK\" 7 Layer Burger (which the boyfriend demolished and loved), Sizzling Fatijas (good to share and smells and tastes oh-so-delicious!), and Brew- Battered Fish and Chips (nothing special).  The customer service at this particular location is fantastic, and we always request for Matt, who has been there for quite a long time but he loves what he does and he's good at what he does too!   I guess you can call me a regular Kelsey's guest and we'll keep it that way."}
{"text":"Great service, consistent and always on time. When I order the nachos, they are more than enough to share and always prepared in the same manner. Hands-down the best restaurant when it comes to consistent food and beverage."}
{"text":"We've been here 3 times in past 2 months. Service was decent first 2 times...but tonight's was just ok - waitress very friendly, always acts like she's got somewhere else to be (even though it's not overly busy). Burgers every time have been DELICIOUS!!!! Beer and wine are good & specialty drinks were fine (margaritas need help). Definitely come back again though! Very kid-friendly too!"}
{"text":"Food was surprisingly decent. Came with low expectations as we were looking for a place that can accommodate 8 last minute on a Friday. There's a lot on the menu but didn't seem to have any good choices.  Fish and chips were light and flaky - way better than I  expected! Fish tacos use the same fish and batter. Presentation is so so. Fried calamari was light, crispy and flavourful. Popcorn shrimp is no good - steer clear. Service however was very very slow."}
{"text":"I would give this place 0 stars if I could. 
Came with a co-worker after work for drinks and food on a Thursday. Half priced wings that tasted like crap.
Let me tell you, our waitress was really forgetful and had a bit of an attitude....borderline rude. Second time here. It'll be the last."}
{"text":"S.O was in the mood for fajitas so here we are on a Tuesday night!  It was pretty quiet at 8pm and we opted to sit in the bar area.  We were served by the bartender / server who was very friendly and attentive.  Ordered a spicy caesar and club soda to start.  Broccoli cheddar soup and chicken sonoma salad as well as the chicken fajitas.  The server was nice enough to recommend  that we order the chicken fajitas instead of the steak as the amount of steak is quite skimpy. 

Soup was hot and tasty and came with a crispy slice of bread.  The mains were also good.  The  salad came out missing half the toppings for some reason.  He was nice enough to go back and get the missing items from the kitchen.  I can honestly say that the quality of the food was much better than what I had last time.  The service in the bar area was friendly and attentive and absolutely no complaints.   Will come again!"}
{"text":"Having a Sunday afternoon cosmopolitan.  A good place to relax after shopping. Service is ok. No real specials with a typical menu selection which is fine by me...sometimes we want no frills  burgers and wings. Right?"}
{"text":"Nothing special, I would say the Applebee's of Canada. Prices are way too high for food quality. Had the shrimp and it was the tough texture kind, very disappointing. The wings were decent and thankfully half priced. Would not make any plans to stop again. 
Service was great! The waitress was friendly and attentive, hence the 3 stars."}
{"text":"Great service but the quality of the food is subpar. The fried calamari had little seasoning. The Thai chicken salad was unevenly cut. The decor is nice but please step up in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Was good for what appears to be a chain restaurant in Canada.   Not sure really.    Huge menu with tons of good choices.   I would go back if I were near it and was in mood for typical restaurant food.   
No complaints,  but nothing jumped out as excellent either.   Just good!"}
{"text":"My wife and daughters took me here for lunch on father's day.

Kelseys is a dying breed, a number of their restaurants near us have closed in the last few years.  This is not due to lack of quality or anything like that, but I would suspect due to the changing ethnic makeup, and the current backlash against corporate food.

This location is located beside the Dixie Auto Mall in Mississauga.  The restaurant is quiet on a Sunday afternoon as all of the automotive dealerships are closed.  As such the staffing complement was a little light.  We were greeted by our hostess / waitress / server after a couple of minutes, and seated at a booth.  My five year old had a view of Santa and Mrs Claus on the patio enjoying their lunch.

The ambience of the restaurant was like most other Kelsey's - a splash of hollywood culture on the walls, sports on the TV, and nicer furniture than the average restaurant.

Our drinks came quickly, and we ordered.  My youngest had the pizza, my vegapygmy daughter and I each had the portobello muchroom burger.  These beauties feature giant portabello mushrooms instead of a meat core.  We even had matching side garden salads.  I guess she really loves me.  The burger was pretty good, earning two thumbs up.

I don't know what my wife ate.  I wasn't paying attention

It was a good meal, we will repeat but we are not in this area that often."}
{"text":"Not the worst salad I've ever had but very close to it added Bacon to the salad for 1.00 and got 1 paper thin pc, under cooked really !!! The waitress was overburdened with way to many tables to wait on and very stressed out I didn't even want to ask for another beer.
And took forever for the food, I'll never return here."}
{"text":"Came to try out some new items on their menu. Server was nice however forgot my lemon with my water. Food was good and the place was not crowded and loud."}
{"text":"While in Canada my bestie said I should try Kelsey's. As an American I would compare Kelsey's to our TGIF or Chili's. We arrived here around 12 pm on a Saturday and this location was not crowded at all. We decided to stop at this location because it was on the way to the zoo. The hostess greeted us and then seated us and our server arrived soon after we were seated. He took our drink orders-- everyone ordered water except me-- I opted for a corona which was really cheap-- I think only like $2.00 or something. Next we decided to place an appetizer order for some wings. We got half honey bbq wings and half buffalo wild wings. They were both pretty good wings-- not the best wings I have had but pretty good. Next I ordered their house tacos. You can mix and match the taco kinds or you can get three of the same type of tacos. I got a fish taco, fried shrimp taco, and chicken taco. My tacos were ok. The shrimp taco was my favorite. The fish taco didn't look completely done and looked like it was frozen fish stick thrown on a taco shell.  While the chicken on my taco tasted really good, I couldn't past the really weird smell it had. My bestie told me the food tasted fresher in Canada but a lot of the food had a weird smell -esp. here. My husband ended up finishing my taco for me since I could not get over the smell. My daughter ordered the kids shrimp alfredo pasta-- which she did not enjoy and they were really skimpy on the alfredo and the shrimp. In all the service here was pretty good, and the food was ok-- but I would look up other options to dine at if back in the area."}
{"text":"Went for half-priced wings on Thursday and it was really sub-par service. I'm not sure if it's always like that, but when we went, it was 3:30pm and fairly empty. Our server didn't come by to greet us or offer us water/drinks for almost 15 minutes. The wings themselves could have been better. I don't generally have wings, I prefer them to be boneless, but my friends like wings and they found that St. Louis, Wild Wings and All-Star Wings were a degree above. I ordered the boneless wings with sweet and spicy Thai chilli and BBQ apple butter sauces. The wings had too much batter and over fried. It was a so-so experience."}
{"text":"It was pretty busy considering I arrived with 4 of my friends at around 9pm on a Friday evening. It's been years since I last visited this location, but it definitely got renovated. The layout was a lot better than what it used to be, without the high walls that sectioned off the restaurant and blocked off all the natural light from the windows. It now has a nice opened layout with lots of sofa seats and high tables with bar stools for people who wanted to just grab drinks. I had ordered the All Day Breakfast burger because breakfast is my favourite meal of the day and who can resist the photo of the burger on the menu with the perfect sunny side up egg sitting on top of the burger patty with bacon. Just describing the photo makes my mouth water. When my burger arrived at the table, all my friends immediately regretted not ordering what I had. I ordered the burger with a side of caesar salad to make myself feel better about making \"healthy\" choices. The bacon was nice and crispy and the yolk spilled when i cut into it. The patty was nicely cooked with just enough seasoning for flavour which went well with the cheddar cheese. The bun was the best part. It was toasted to perfection. It was so crunchy and soft I was shocked. The caesar salad was lightly tossed with just enough dressing. Overall the dining experience was good. My friends and I had a good time and the food was good. Service was also good considering how busy it was at that hour. I'll definitely think of Kelseys the next time I'm craving a breakfast burger."}
{"text":"I never visit Kelsey's like ever but my cousin and I decided to stop by for a quick dinner after a movie one night. As we were walking towards the restaurant, we noticed it has been remodeled and it just looked tacky no offence.

It took a couple of minutes for someone to seat us because there was no one in the front. Our server though, was nice but wasn't too attentive. We never got our water refilled. Anyway, we ordered the spinach dip and the fajitas for 2. The spinach dip was good, I just wished it was more cheesy. And the portions for the sour cream and salsa for our fajitas was small..for 2 people they should've gave more. 

The food here is overpriced and it's not worth it, nothing  special."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner tonight.  This is my hubby's watering hole but we don't normally eat here.

We ordered chicken wings, fish tacos, rack of ribs, 3 different burgers and a kids cheeseburger.  The wings were ok, not great not bad.  The fish tacos were nice but they could've toasted/warmed up the tortilla.  The different burgers were nice, with different toppings.  The rack of ribs were ok.  

Service wasn't too great because we were sat in the bar side and not the proper restaurant.  Had to flag someone down for side plates, refills etc. 

Not a bad place to grab something to eat but not somewhere that I'd frequent much."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time.

Been to many other Kelsey's in the area, this one is as good. Ordered half priced wings, little on the dry side but still good.

Poutine was one of the best I've had.  Friendly Service was a little slow but not nothing to be alarmed about.

Kids were on cloud 9 with the fried Twinkies.

Will return in the future."}
{"text":"Excellent customer care and a clean restaurant. The food needs improvement in terms of taste. The chicken wings are quite big which is a good thing.

Went in to celebrate my parents' anniversary and was a little disappointed with the quality of food. The fish and chips, wings, shrimp and ribs had no punch in them and was tasting quite ordinary and bland. The observation was the same right across the table. I asked for hot and honey wings but I got honey garlic with a dash of hot that could only be tasted occasionally. Was very disappointed with that.

The server was very pleasant and was able to make recommendations based on what we were feeling for. In my experience, not many servers are willing to go that extra mile. Kudos to the lovely lady."}
{"text":"Decided to check out the new revamp. Place looks good and service was decent but not great considering the place was pretty much empty and we still have to wait for the waiters to finish their little gossip session going on in the bar area. The food was not so good. My friend and I both ordered pasta dishes. I had the chicken parm and she had the alfredo chicken pasta. The chicken parm barely had any cheese on it and the cheese it did have didn't look like it was just put on the chicken but more like it had been there for quite some time all dried up. The tomato sauce was dry and clumpy. The alfredo chicken pasta looked great until you took a bite out of it. There was absolutely no flavor and pasta tasted like cardboard. Both dishes were left pretty much untouched which you think would tell them something but when the waiter asked us if we wanted to take it home and we told him that no the food was not good he took away the plates and came back with our bill for both dishes.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"Visiting from the states on a Saturday night.  Never heard of Kelsey's. House Merlot is flat.  Riesling was good.  Calamari & ribs were good too.  Mashed potatoes were mediocre.  And fish tacos were ok.  The tortillas were right out of the package & should have beef warmed or grilled.  They use picked onions on the fish tacos that were terrible.  Guacamole was also bland.  Burgers looked great- that's what we should have ordered.  Waitress was not very attentive.  Also a lot of tables needed cleared..."}
{"text":"Never been a big fan of Kelsey's, it's one of the lower end when it comes to food in these big chains.  However the staff are very friendly here.  I also like the shrimp curry bowl."}
{"text":"Visited the restaurant last night with my bf. I was impressed by the pics from Yelp. Currently, they are having a $10 entree special with a $5 small plate add on with the purchase of any entree. This pricing was great especially since drinks weren't on special. We arrived around 8:30p and found the dining room & bar booths to be full. We instead sat at the bar. Service at the bar was slow which was odd since there were only a few of us sitting AT the bar. We had a big lunch so we shared dinner. We ordered the salty & sweet chicken tenders and the spinach dip. The dip was amazing. The chicken tenders, were still good although slightly overcooked. What I found bothersome was the drinks. This restaurant waters down their drinks. I ordered a Long Island which is just alcohol with a splash of coca-cola for color. Well, what they served me was the inverse. Coca-cola with a splash of alcohol. Given that there's a liquor store next door, I'd just go there for my alcohol fix and this place for food.?"}
{"text":"I went here with my daughter and the service and food was excellent!   The food was prepared right.  My daughter who is a picky eater enjoyed her meal.  We will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Cali, pretty much a standard Red robin/Chilis. Got the fish and chips. It was ok. Nothing special, but waitress was cute and nice lol. Smile on her face made my rough travel day better. Good service, lots of TV 's."}
{"text":"Sad to give such a low rating because... We didn't even order food! We left before our glasses of water reached us, which is sad. 

Got to restaurant and waited to be seated. No one greeted us for about 10 minutes. The restaurant is relatively dead, no one was in the bar area (not even a bartender was there). When we finally got seated we just asked for water first. After another 10 minutes of waiting to get our glasses of water and to place our order, we just decided to leave. And when we were putting on our coats to leave, the server finally came over and said water is still on the way! Are you pumping fresh water from somewhere?! Honestly, no one should wait 10 minutes for water in any restaurant... Busy or dead. 
Another reason why we left is there wasn't anything on the menu that we wanted enough. Why pay $20 for a plain burger that you don't really want to eat?! I didn't want to settle for something on the menu for the sake of eating there. 

I never got up and left before but I'm really glad we did. It could have been an easy $50 down the drain. We went home and got McDonalds and I loved it."}
{"text":"So Kelsey's rebranded.

We decided to give this place a try because of the renovation and new look. Unfortunately, it wasn't exactly full of improvements as it might seem at face value. The first thing we saw was a marquee \"HELLO\" right at the entrance, probably the brightest, most imposing light bulbs I've seen in a while. Anyways, onwards.

The interior looked nice, I mean it's brand new after all, but that's almost where the experience ends (I'll get to the real last hurrah in a second). The interaction with the hostess was sufficiently awkward as it seemed she wasn't adept at steering a conversation, however once we sat down we were hoping the menu got some Botox too like the rest of the place. It didn't.

Other than some cringey name changes (some of which border on copyright infringement - I mean come on. \"Quesadilla-dilla-dilla\". Really? ) It's more or less the same. That being said, the entire vibe of this place is cringey, I always hate when chain restaurants try to be hip when you know there's an older exec with a PR department making these choices, which is the polar opposite of the business they're trying to masquerade as. 

Our server who was an older gentleman came by and seemed friendly at first. My partner got the veggie fajitas as always, and I got a burger. Their burger ordering process has 4 steps in the menu: choice of bun, protein, cheeses, toppings. When I ordered my burger I ordered with only one party because I wasn't too hungry, however I wanted to make up for it with toppings and a pretzel bun which sounded nice. Our waiter skipped right over that and asked \"fries?\". I reluctantly said yes I'd like fries on the side but can I customize it? I said this reluctantly because he wasn't writing anything down - that makes me nervous. All I wanted was a cheeseburger with extra pickles and to no surprise they were out of pickles. Since 3pm apparently too - clearly no effort was made to restock during those 8 hours when there's a grocery store walking distance away.

The food came and it was all pretty tasty. That's the last hurrah I mentioned earlier.

There was a sign on the table saying you'd get free brownie pops if you signed up for their exclusive club, so I did, and the server said he'd bring those over after the meal but they never came.

Overall, nothing impressive. Food is good, and my burger came out to only $10 because I got a single patty (which was perfectly filling by the way, despite what the server insisted). Otherwise I don't think it's necessarily a must-try by any means. Just another American-style restaurant."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Kelsey's in years. But one Saturday some girlfriends wanted to go. It wasn't that bad. The food was great, portions were enough, and kind/friendly service."}
{"text":"I showed up to a practically empty restaurant and was told there was a 45 minute wait for a table! The foyer was packed, at least 15-20 people! 
The manager said that the kitchen was too busy to seat tables. Luckily I was not one of the people who had been waiting for more than 30 minutes already!
I suggested they at least seat the guests to be comfortable and the hostess rolled her eyes at me!
After being seated (even with the expected wait for food), the restaurant was filthy AND the servers were rude - treated us like we inconvenienced them.

Worst Kelsey's / Cara experience ever!!"}
{"text":"I adore Kelsey's and this is a good location. I tried the wonton nachos which were pretty gross and overpowering."}
{"text":"My friend had her bachelorette party dinner here; understandable as it's close to her home and there's something for everyone on the menu. We were a group of  ten and I found our server to be extremely attentive/personable. The food was pretty good and quite reasonable; I ordered the shrimp tacos (three in an order) that were nice on a hot summer night. As dessert, we had the Reese's dessert; for $10, the portion was quite large so four of us shared it. Kelsey's is found in a large plaza with a lot of free parking on site, which was appreciated as I drove to the restaurant. This area isn't my usual hang out location so I'm not sure when I'll be back nor will I go out of my way to return; however, it was great for what it was.

Good for: lunch, dinner, groups"}
{"text":"It had been awhile since I had eaten at this Kelsey's location since we had a bad service experience almost 10 years ago. 

I used to love Kelsey's fajitas when I was younger so took a leap and went with my wife and young son. I ordered steak fajitas and I was sorry that I did. For $20 the quality was horrible with so little steak (Cut into cubes instead of strips) and small amount of toppings. The shredded cheese looked like it was the powder at the bottom of a store bought bag. The wraps were practically glued together into one large mass. Not enjoyable at all. I should have just stayed with the basics and gotten a burger. 

The other thing is this place looks like it's right out of the late 90s/early 2000s with outdated photos of celebs.

I thought the service was good but the food wasn't. Too bad."}
{"text":"Service was ok, host and waiter were both nice. However, the food not so great. Ordered double peppercorn cheeseburger which had some inconsistent amount of pepper across the patty. Plating was kind of odd...burger and fries on a long plate...lots of empty space. My wife had the fish n chips which were terrible. First they were soggy and barely crispy...sent it back and they did come back crispy this time around. But that wasnt the only issue. Very bland taste, pretty much zero seasoning.

Probably wont be going back again even with all those coupons in the mail. Kelsey's you gotta do better than just renovating the interior...if the food is bad no one will come."}
{"text":"This Kelsey's is amazing! We went on a Thursday night and it was packed. They had lots of vegetarian options in the appetizers and everything tasted amazing. Our server was fantastic, despite it being busy she checked in on us frequently and was extremely receptive. I would definitely recommend this location."}
{"text":"Met up with some friends for wing night.  Made reservations for 6 people only but kids decided to join us.  When we got there we had asked if we can have a table for 10.  The first girl said she could not help us rudely.  We were even willing to sit in separate tables. I get it the place was busy.  The next girl that came to talk to us was so nice and got us a table.  Anyway, that was the only  down side to our night.  The service was great.  We ordered big pan nachos and wings in 4 flavours and everything was yummy!  Will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Came here a lot this past week due to their $10 promo as well as their drink specials. I love when restaurants offer specials / promotions at a reasonable price, it really helps trying out different restaurants in the area. Tried different things off the promo menu: peppercorn burger, bacon cheese burger, grilled chicken salad, and their margaritas. Best deals so far I've seen at any major chain resto. I would rate higher if they stepped up the quality of their food, sometimes I find the food on their regular menu a bit lacklustre."}
{"text":"I have been to Kelsey's quite a few times over the years but not as often as I would like. I have visited two different locations since their rebranding and new menu. The ambiance is casual but cool - rustic with wood-topped tables and a more open-concept dining room. They have pared down their menu a fair bit but there is still a wide selection of starters and entrees.
We recently went to this location for dinner. Service was excellent (given it was a Monday night). The wings are generous so you definitely get what you pay for. I had their chicken fingers with food truck chips (their version of fries) with a starter Caesar salad. We had their Go Nuts donuts for dessert - we didn't need them but they were so good, especially with the caramel sauce."}
{"text":"8 of our Family decided to drop in for a Sunday lunch without a reservation. I was a bit worried but they made us up a table real fast and even let us use another table for more room.
  Myself and wife ordered the grilled cheese and bacon sandwiches with sweet potato fries and onion rings. Both were tasty and the grilled cheese with Chipotle ketchup was awesome. It was a nice touch to have mushrooms in it, gave it a nice flavor. Our kids got the ultimate cheese burger with fries and we'll! !!! Quite big, in fact huge and also flavorful.. the gravy wasn't all that great but the kids both loved the burger.
 Would definitely go back again, maybe for a dinner next time"}
{"text":"Decent for a chain restaurant. Love the half price wing nights. Im always a sucker for yhe broccoli cheddar soup, and while its always tasty, every time I order it, the thickness of the soup is never the same. Some days its waaaay too thick. Burgers And fries are good. Service can be a little slow and lacking. 3.5/5"}
{"text":"Newly renovated and just reopened. Same classic Kelsey's fare but they now have 10 plus beers on tap as well as wine on tap as well. 

My wife and daughter have been coming here for years and are so happy to see that they finally renovated from that classic 80's look that was just getting tired looking. 

We had the quesadilla with chicken which was good and my daughter had the wings which were done crispy and saucy just the way she likes them. 

Overall I would say it remains a good choice for a reasonably priced family night out."}
{"text":"Food was average and service was slow and mostly non-existent. My waitress was working a huge area and I saw her to order, bring my food and check. No follow up during the meal.   She needed help and the manager was trying but no real help"}
{"text":"Walked into the restaurant was greated right away from staff. Was very busy but tge astomspher was excellent. Staff was very friendly. Used to work for Kelseys years ago. And love the new look. Management as well on the ball it seems. Helping out where can. Food excellent.  If I was I lived in the area this would be my social hangout. And strongly recommend siting in the bar. That's where the excitement is. 

Keep up the great work"}
{"text":"Kelsey's has a new summer menu for lunch and dinner! The following review is based on our experience of their new menu.

After a night out at the movies (at the new Markham Cineplex Centre) with my family, we decided to have a late night dinner at Kelsey's.
We ordered:

Spinach Dip: cheese, spinach, red pepper, and onion - served with deep-fried pita triangle chips. I've had really good spinach dips from Jack Astor's so I wasn't honestly expecting much from Kelsey's but I have to say that Kelsey's version of the dip is good - almost as good as Jack's. My whole family enjoyed it so I was pleased with this order.

Popcorn Shrimp: We didn't like this one as much. It's basically shrimp lightly coated with a mild jalapeno seasoning and served with a Thai chili sauce. It was okay - the Thai chili sauce was mediocre - not as authentic and flavourful as could have been... and the shrimp was plain breaded shrimp. Not that special - in flavour nor in texture. A bit soft for my expectations.

Regular (10 pieces) Wings: We chose Mild for the sauce flavour since we had a couple of people who don't do well with spice. Surprisingly, the wings here are delicious. We didn't think that Kelsey's would do particularly well with  wings since this place isn't specifically a wings place but they do them well here. We'd definitely come again just for the wings. They have a Thursday special - half-off wings so maybe I'll pop by on an upcoming Thursday night.

Funnel cake fries: Golden fried strips of funnel cake topped with cinammon sugar, served warm with French Vanilla ice cream and a choice of strawberry, peanut butter, chocolate, or English toffee caramel sauce. We picked the strawberry sauce. We found this dessert to be good but it doesn't beat funnel cakes from Canada's Wonderland. For texture, these funnel cake fries were good but not as crispy as I wanted them to be.. instead they were more soft and stiff. It was a decent dessert but I think I'll try something new next time. 

I'd recommend coming here to check out their new summer menu. I definitely recommend their wings and their spinach dip. I'll be coming again to try new things on their new menu!"}
{"text":"I was in the area waiting for a movie to start with time to kill.  Wanted to go to Montana's for dinner but with the backlog, I didn't think the timing would work so we decided to walk a bit further to Kelsey's.

As far as food chains in Canada go, Kelsey's is like the Coffee Time of the coffee chain world. They have a variety of items but the quality is meh...

The layout is nice and they have a big bar area with large TVs.  The service is pretty friendly but I think that's pretty standard and part of the standard corporate manual for all of the food chains.

There are plenty of food items to choose from.  Probably about the same amount as a place like Jack Astors but a few less than Pickle Barrel or Boston Pizza.  If you're really hungry, this place probably gives you most food on your plate. In fact, if you're more than one and neither of you are very hungry, you might be able to get by with one appetizer and one main.

Sadly, the reason why this food chain is at or near the bottom of the food chain is that it is afraid to use seasoning. I've never had so many items taste like water.  The potato skins were bland, the batter on the chicken fingers had no flavour and even the vinaigrette salad dressing had no acidity. 

I'm not sure if their chefs are worried about customers complaining that their food is too spicy or if they are trying to cut costs but if there's no taste in the food and you're going to give big portions, you're going to end up with alot of waste.  I think the best thing a customer can do with their unfinished food is take it home and repurpose it into their own meal and use their own seasoning to make it better.

I should have stayed and waited at Montana's... *sigh*"}
{"text":"I came here with one of my friends because we wanted to enjoy the patio weather we were habing that day.

Upon arriving we were promptly seated outside and servwd our beverages. I ordered the fish tacos while my friend ordered the spinach dip. Both meals took about 20 minutes to come out.

The tacos were so delicious. I don't know if it was how they seasoned it or how they prepared it, but I absolutely loved it. The spinach dip was pretty good as well.

When it came time to pay, our server told us we were welcome to stay as long as we like because it wasn't a very busy day, but we left promptly after. Great place that's for sure!"}
{"text":"I don't visit Kelsey's too often but their food is a bit hit and miss here. 

For starters we shared the calamari and spinach dip appetizers with fried pitas. These were delicious. The calamari while not plentiful was nicely tender and had a creamy chunky aioli which had sun dried tomatoes in it! The calamari also came with a variety of veggies such as breaded onions, jalapenos, and red peppers. I was told the spinach dip here is a must order and it was! It was super creamy and cheesy and there was just the right amount of pita as well. You had a choice of getting fried or baked pita but we went with the fried ones for more of a crunch.

I went with their burger fest special for the main and was rather disappointed by it because it looked phenomenal. It was simply too dry. It was a good concept with good toppings but the execution wasn't there. The buffalo chicken fingers were huge (it comprised of maybe 50% of the burger!), crisp, and nicely sauced but the chicken breast meat itself was too dry. The beef patty was also rather dry, combined with a dense bun as well made it very hard to swallow down. I'm not sure if this was a single incident or not, but only if the burger was juicy this would have been an amazing one! The same deal with the chip truck style fries, they were rather thick as well but that's moreso due to the style here. The fries here are definitely good if you like that kind of style! 

Service was really pleasant here and I liked the atmosphere which was very relaxed."}
{"text":"Rating is based solely on weekday lunchtime sit-down. It never really gets jam-packed at lunchtime, but the service tends to be slow at this location. There's usually only one staff member handling the entire dining area.

Considering the time restrictions of the typical work lunch break, you'd expect a chain restaurant to have quicker service during weekday lunch hours. Not the case here. Most times, your lunch, from the moment you sit down to the time you pay your bill, will take close to an hour. 

I'd highly advise ordering quickly and asking for your bills at least 10 minutes before you need to pay. 

Foodwise, it's a chain so it's pretty standard fare. I really liked the taco mix and match - 3 for $12.99. You can mix and match between breaded shrimp, fish, and jerk chicken. The fish and breaded shrimp were pretty good, but the jerk chicken was seriously lacking in flavour. One unique aspect of this dish was that the 3 tacos were presented on top of a gigantic tortilla, with the edges hanging off the edge of your plate. This was oil drenched, but I have to admit, it tasted really good. Seasoning was perfect."}
{"text":"You can catch me here every Thursday. This is my go to wing place!! There is a never a wait so I'm usually seated right away. I usually rather sit on the bar side because there are TVs which they play sports games on (the dining room has no TVs what so ever) so I try to come here during raptors game times. 

I always stick to my honey garlic and my boyfriend loves his salt and pepper. They also have the option of breaded or unbreaded wings. Also accompanied by the classic carrots and celery with the choice of blue cheese or ranch. 

On Thursday the drink special is $5 pints for domestic!!"}
{"text":"As per my 7 year old daughters suggestion, we decided to finally visit Kelseys for the first time in all of our lives.  LOL. Plenty of free parking and the interior Atmosphere was great.  Newly renovated and clean.  The Sunday drink specials are great.  Beer was cold (5 Buck Pints) and Hail the 5 Buck Ceasars!  Our waitress was quick to take our drink orders and checked up on us frequently.  Our Nikki was starving and we lucked out that her Grilled Cheese Kids Dinner and Shrimp and Calamari app came out fast.  However, it took over an hour for our entrees to hit the table.  Our waitress was very apologetic and me being the non-confrontational type appreciated her behaviour towards us.    I ordered the amped up double cheese burger with bacon, back bacon, red onions, lettuce, mayo and tomatoes.  All the burger came with was double patty, lettuce, cheese and both bacons.   No Red Onions, Tomatoes or Mayo.   When you freaking craving a burger all day long and this is what you get!   DAYAAM!   My lovely wife said that her Gourmet Salad was delicious.  Our lovely waitress, without even advising us, provided us with 40% off our meal.  Dont think I will be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Went for lunch had fish taco appetizer and beef taco salad .. could  not taste salt and vinegar in the tacos and the fish was barely noticeable .. beef taco salad was good including the taxi bowl"}
{"text":"Just don't order the fried shrimp tacos.

Came here for a casual lunch with coworkers - I've been to Kelsey's before but not this location. I ordered the popcorn shrimp tacos, they cost about $12 before tax. I really can't think of anything positive to say about the dish - the shrimp was over-fried, so all you tasted was the crunch of the batter. Gross. Guacamole didn't have much flavour.

Service was friendly and my coworkers made decent comments about their dish - \"good\", \"chicken is moist\", etc."}
{"text":"Great ambience. Not too noisy and not crowded on a Friday 8pm. 

Chicken quesadilla quite good but not enough perhaps for guys with big appetites. 

Chicken fried chicken actually very flavourful. 

Sirloin medium rare was cooked right and not dry, though I was expecting a little easier to cut and a little more juice/blood(?). Not bad so youngest son loved it. 

Bacon burger tasted 3x better than any other fast food burger I've tried. :) Kelsey's burger is obviously not \"fast food\" quality so if you love burgers, you will love theirs. 

Server was very polite and attentive. Will definitely come back here. We've tried the one in Niagara so this was our first time in this location."}
{"text":"Ordered the peppercorn burger but subbed a veggie patty for the double beef patty (for some reason if you sub a double beef patty you only get one veggie patty). Worked out in the end since the patty was very bland and had hard chewy bits in it. The goat cheese and onions rings (which were missing and added five minutes of wait time to receive them) saved the burger and made it edible. Upgraded the fries to a poutine for $2.50 bringing the total for the meal to $18.49 which is kind of pricey. The upgrade, although tasty, wasn't worth it. It came with very little cheese and not enough gravy.

The service was good; The hostess was friendly and seated us immediately. Once seated, the server came to get our order right away.

I like their new look. The tables and lighting have a nice rustic look to them. The plates are also attractive but may be too large as it made the serving size look small. 

Nothing I would come back for, but if you want to try this place out, expect a solid 3/5."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. The food was worse. 

I must say, the interior was horrendous. We retreated to the patio almost immediately. 

**Right off the bat it was a bad start**
-Our beverages had all arrived late (37 minutes) after being seated.
-Then our food arrived (40minutes) after the drinks.

I was ready to leave at this point

But how much worse could it get? Might as well stay and eat since the sun has already settled and everything else is now closed.

The bun used for the burgers were definitely aged and were not specified in the menu. The lettuce tasted like dry straw - the kind used for scarecrows on halloween. 

My first and last time for this place. 
$42 dollars wasted.  
No pictures because it was too dark outside."}
{"text":"Came here around 8pm Sunday (Canada day weekend). It was suprisingly not packed at all. We told the hostes a couple of times that we want to sit outside, before she checked and then started setting our table inside, we had to ask her again, and then she sat us outside. (She also later bumped into our table and lucky only knocked over an empty beer bottle) 

Otherwise the service was pretty good from our server, always in the are and was never missing for too long. The food was pretty decent bar food, however my chicken burger had way too much hot sauce in it, made it too hard to taste anything else. The mild chicken wings were pretty good though. 
Otherwise the place is pretty decent to come by and have some bar food with friends. 

Bathroom was kinda smelly."}
{"text":"I had the salmon with the mashed potatoes and steamed vegetables. Overall the meal was good...however the portion was small and still left me hungry. Not good. 

We started with the garlic bread and cheese, and I get that restaurants want to be different, but this incarnation was a complete fail. The garlic bread was some twisted variety that had barely any cheese...garlic...or butter. Kelsey's would be best to take this off their rotation and come up with something better. Even keeping it simple might just have been better for all concerned. 

Originally I asked for as Cob salad and the waitress told me that they can't even make that, because they don't have the ingredients! They don't have any pre-boiled eggs. 

The best advice I can give is for the person in charge to PLEASE rethink the menu and come up with some things that are \"old stand byes\". Even a Cob salad option would be awesome too."}
{"text":"This was the coolest Kelsey's I've ever been to.
Walking distance from the Cinema, it's a great place to grab a bite before the movies.
It is so bright and colourful and I loved the patio.
Even though it was a Saturday and the place looked busy, we were seated outside right away.
I liked how there wasn't just a little door to walk out, it was like a big garage door that lead to the patio.
It was the perfect temperature outside. Not too hot or too cold.
To order, I had the chicken alfredo linguini with goat cheese and fried onions on top.
In my opinion... everything should have fried onions on it.
It was delicious and a massive portion.
They advertised there would be tomatoes... don't get your hopes up... there were hardly any pieces of tomatoes. It still tasted great though.
My boyfriend had the pretzel burger.
DANG, that was good. Of course I helped him eat it.
It consisted of: a pretzel bun, juicy patty, pulled pork, fried onions, cheese, and mushrooms.
It was what foodie dreams are made of.
We had the sweet potato fries as well and they came with plenty of spicy mayo. :)
To drink, we had the special (they have drink specials every day and this being a Saturday it was domestic pints for $5).
We could upsize it another 3 oz for $1. So ya. We did that.
The food came out quickly which was great because we didn't order an appetizer (with that giant beer and their big portions... you don't need one).
The bill came to $51 and change after tax, before tip.
Our server was great.
My only issue was that after our meal was done we were being rushed to leave.
 \"Do you need change?\" \"No?\" awkward staring contest.

We are going to leave. Can I finish my water?"}
{"text":"Compared to every other kelseys in york region or toronto this has to be the worst one in terms of quality of food and serving staff. The meal preperation and quality of the food was horrid. The staff was very zombie like & the food tasted old, bland & rushed. Don't risk it.. trust me"}
{"text":"Compared to Montanas, service was much better- we went a bit early for a quick bit o. Halloween; food was ok- generic Buffalo chicken with a lonely pickle- sodium bomb. My wife ordered a salad which she said was good."}
{"text":"My family must have loved it here- $195.00 for a massive nachos platter, several pedestrian burgs, salad and more burgs couples with some fairly good service chalked up to a pretty decent night out. 

We came on a Tuesday evening, and while there are no food specials, there is an o going tall boy for $5.00 with a local or generic option. Kelsey's at this location is Kelsey's at generally every location, passable, however you can appreciate that the service was in no rush to turnover the table, so the atmosphere was relaxed and casual. 

I referenced the amount for 6 people, and what happened was quite I retesting from my vantage point. When we ordered 2 pounds of wings and a Godzilla sized nachos, we all agreed that we would not order any more mains. But what happened next was like that conversation never happened, with another giant overpriced crunchy water plate drenched  in house dressing and another three burgers? It's your fault for having tastie food and 
leaving me stuck with the bill."}
{"text":"Their food was good and fresh. Amazing customer service. Drinks were good. definately going again."}
{"text":"Horrible experience at this location. We used to love Kelseys but I'm sure this is the last time we come here. 

1. Greeting us was a girl without any smile on her face, she even didn't ask us anything until I had to come & ask her for a table. 

2. The server was nice but it was too hard to reach her whenever we needed (it was on Tue night and the restaurant was not busy at all).

3. I ordered Maple Mustard Salmon & it was supposed to come with rice in the menu, but unfortunately they messed up my meal with mashed potato. They didn't tell anything till I noticed the rice was missed & asked them first. The server asked me if I want a bowl of rice (oh yes...a bowl of rice after I finished my meal, that's so \"nice\")

4. The washroom was super nasty & dirty!! Water was flooded on the floor & toilet was stuck with tons of papers. No one cleaned & they left that mess for the customers.

5. At the end, we HAD TO TIP them 18% for our horrible experience we had. There was no other option for leaving tip, only 18% & 20%. I'm feeling like they're stealing my money!!! Food is pricey, small portion for every meal, worst customer service & crazy tip.

Sorry Kelseys, if this is how you're doing business now you're losing all of your customers!"}
{"text":"Really cool look and feel inside, more like a bar then a typical chain restaurant. I was pretty surprised by the 7 layer burger. Better than average. The patty was so soft and topping were pretty generous. The fries were below average though. We had spinach dip as our appetizer which was pretty typical. Nothing special but not bad either."}
{"text":"Milestones envy? Located right next door to Milestones, I can't find any other reason for Kelsey's generic bar food to have pricing so close to the upscale Milestones.  Mains running from $10 to $20 is not what I expect from a midline restaurant.

The food was fine, but the price reflects something better.  Walk another 30 steps for much more interesting fare at the same price."}
{"text":"This location has been opened a long time and am surprised it still is. Has been very quiet. It seemed busier here 10 years ago. Still...Not bad food and close to places such as CHAPTERS, HOME DEPOT, and MICHAEL'S."}
{"text":"We were having a terrible day and in leaving the the hospital with our seemingly ok 5 year old daughter decided to have something quick and easy, close to home. This spot was perfect in every way. Our server Mario was just the positive energy we needed and the food (though simple and comforting) was awesome!!!

Not sure why, but when we got there our little daughter ran up and gave the hostess a hug. \"That just melted my heart\" she said, but it started a great dinner and highly recommend experience.

Thank you Mario for your personality and nailing it !!!!

{"text":"The waitress was good. She did her job. Didn't seem overly friendly but I'm not mad at that.

I had the Tuscan Salad ( I think) all I know is it came with Thai Popcorn Shrimp and it was ONE of the most delicious salads I've ever eaten! I ate every scrape! I would get that again in a heartbeat. THAT IS HOW YOU MAKE A SALAD.

Tasty! 

Also, the funnel cake fries were amazing...oh man I'm getting hungry writing about it."}
{"text":"I come to this location all the time, i find it better than the other Brampton locations. Food is consistently good, service usually very great. I prefer to be seated in Mike's section as he is an amazing server. Menu changes come more frequently now which is a good opportunity to try many different things, and desserts are amazing. Overall, Kelsey's is one of my favourite restaurants"}
{"text":"Nauseating food. The nachos had no cheese on them, the peppercorn burger had no pepper and really weird-tasting cheese, the steak was so-so. I guess the popcorn shrimp were ok by comparison. 

This place has gone downhill. No wonder it was empty. The only reason it's a two and not a one star is our waiter was great and it's not his fault the food is awful. It's nothing but grease and salt and not in a good way."}
{"text":"We walked in on a busy Wednesday night, right around dinner time.  The hostess was friendly and offered us a table or to find our own place in the bar - we went with the latter.

This was just a quick date for a couple drinks.  Kelsey's has a great beer and wine selection, so no problem there.  We just wanted an appetizer and went with the 7 Layer Dip.  It was incredible.  I can't stress this enough.  The lettuce on top doesn't do a whole lot for the plate, but the flavours baked into the cheese, spinach and dip were phenomenal.  I highly highly recommend this dish.

We had a very friendly and attentive server, even though his section was full.  It's in a convenient spot next to the theatre...it would be a perfect stop while waiting for a movie.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Well, I can just say I go there at least twice a month... love the food but can use some new food ideas, waiters are always cheerful and happy to serve you"}
{"text":"Your typical American dine in restaurant. This was my first visit since they did thier renovations and it looks really nice inside. Cozy with a modern feel.

I order regular (10)wings sauced with sweet chili thai sauce. The wings were perfect lightly dusty temperature wise fresh and hot and the sauce was the perfect mixture of sweet with a little kick of spice.

My waitress was very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Came here on a quiet, rainy, wednesday night...and boy was it empty due to the terrible weather.  Nonetheless this meant YAAY we could sit anywhere so we chose a bar booth.  After settling in our server took care of us with our drinks.

For food, since both of us were not too hungry, we decided to do Chicken fajitas!! its been a while since I've eaten this, so it was a trip down memory lane.  THough I am sure down in the South fajitas are delish! this one was okay, Kelsey's fajita was satisfying, however nothing to rave about.  The chicken tasted a bit bland, and lacked some spices/ marinade.  The sides (sour creme, lettuce, tomatoes, peppers) helped compliment the dish! 

Overall place is clean, and the service is decent!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for YEARS! and its the same bartender, who really adds a nice class of service, and experience any time you come to this Kelsey's location in Markham.  The service was, as always, excellent!  The food was tasty, and out of most bars, they can really make good nachos, unfortunately same can't be said for Jack Astors. Their wings was tasty, perfect balance of sauce, and spice.  I'll definitely be back for a second round......next week :) 
Half price wings on Thursdays!"}
{"text":"Post Pan-Am grub at Kelseys.
After the Pan-Am closing ceremony, I decided to head out WEST. yes In the wrong direction and stumbled upon the newly improved Kelseys. I can recall the old looking Kelsey buildings with the old fashioned exterior/interior look, but I must say it looks a lot better now. 
Though we came for late night food, their Bar and patio areas are very spacious, clean and presentable. 
They've made some changes to their menus so we decided to take a jab at it.
We decided to order their classic wings, this time with their Apple butter bbq sauce, WOW! quite innovative, and c'mon..apple and bbq usually go well so it was definitely delish!
the other app we ordered was their classic nachos with Montreal smoked meat, it was certainly different, however would have loved if they added more meat to make it more MEATY. fyi patrons have the option to choose either corn chips or Wonton crisps, but I stuck with the original Corn! 
Overall, both dishes were well presented, the service was fast and friendly. 

For those patio lovers, like me, they've got a nice outdoor, and partial outdoor patio. :) 

ill be back!"}
{"text":"Food was okay, but a bit pricey for what you get. Last time we ate here was about 5 years ago, and portion sizes have decreased while prices have gone up. Pasta dishes used to come with garlic bread, now it's extra. The bread was good, but this seemed like a strange choice. 
We also found a small piece of plastic in our pasta dish, most likely from a sauce packet or something. That's not a huge issue (we still ate the pasta), but after telling the server, we thought the manager would come out just to check on us. We don't expect a free dish, or even a substantial discount, but taking the bread charge off the bill or something like that would have been a nice gesture. While our server was very friendly and prompt, we felt like we were being nickel and dimed by the restaurant."}
{"text":"Service was very friendly and the food was really good.
Had the wings and I thought they were done just right!"}
{"text":"My experience here was very good. I was recommended to Kelsey's by a client of mine here in Bolton. As I am on a diet currently, I opted for the grilled chicken with a balsamic cream sauce. I ordered the chicken with only a side of roasted vegetables and I was very pleased with the way the dish turned out. The chicken was cooked wonderfully-very moist and was full of flavor. My waitress was very attentive and friendly and added to the enjoyment of my dinner that evening. Looking forward to coming back to Kelsey's."}
{"text":"This kelseys has been at this location for years... haven't been in a very long time but my girlfriend wanted to eat something closeby and not Chinese food.. Lol... choices were very limited..So we jus stopped by here. 

We happened to find out upon arrival that it was wings night.. so mite as well... I guess Kelseys is really goin down the drain in terms of quality... server wasn't smart enough to bring us all water when we asked for 1 glass but there is only a party of 3 people... how can you not bring 2 more glasses? 

we ordered wings, appetizers, salad and one main course. Wings were super dry to a point i felt like i was chewing rubber... that is bad... wonder if it is because its half price? 

salad was overdone with Caesar sauce... way too creamy... not enough croutons.. 

Potato skins arghh...when I'm charged like $10 for potato skin I expect it to be ok.. not without any ingredients on the first and last piece. Sighs.. 

Seafood pasta.. linguine was overcooked...to a point it was close to disintegrate. Into chicken noodle soup. Al dente is on the package for goodness sake. Follow the instructions.... gosh... 

Server forgot our order... we had to remind him.. feel sorry for kelseys that they are so not up to par with the competition.... and it's not cheap..."}
{"text":"BURGERS, i made the mistake of not ordering a burger but never again; The burgers looked so yummy, big and messy, will update again once tried."}
{"text":"Slow service in the restaurant. We moved to the bar. Service was better. Excellent nachos."}
{"text":"Not the Kelseys I remember. The menu was hard to read. Took a while to find pricing. Clue: Light blue print crowded with the calorie count. 
Ordered a $15 burger and it arrived cremated and dry.  Fries were ok. Harvey's would have been better. 
Service was good. Very quick in table turnaround. Benches were torn and ragged. Don't think they wanted to be that rustic."}
{"text":"Came to try the\"Everything but the kitchen sink burger\". But when I ordered it with no bun (I have a grain intolerance) I guess the kitchen interpreted that as \"Everything but the kitchen sink and but the lettuce and but the spicy mayo too\". Food was a little slow coming out but the server was very pleasant."}
{"text":"Hadn't been to Kelseys in a long time as I evade most chain restaurants, but I must give them credit when due. Food was delicious, yet service lacking...had to ask for a refill and he was scarce until he handed us our bill. Forgivable however as the lunch rush had begun. It's a busy restaurant with lots of meal options and affordable lunch specials."}
{"text":"unless you are ordered, lost or from brampton or Whitby or some awful place...  Why here???  Food is bland, everything beyond mediocre to poor, bad.  The staff is annoying (new besties).  So much wrong with Kelseys, mainly; not a good deal for a family (pricey), and you will leave less satisfied than dining at a Mandarin."}
{"text":"We came for dinner. Noisy and dirty with screaming kids. They were out of noodles for the Asian Shanghai Noodles and there was a delay for my fajitas because the didn't have enough onions prepped. What a joke.

When the food came the salmon was burnt and over salty - basically inedible. The vegetables were supposed to be steamed, but were raw.  The beef for the fajitas was also overcooked. Why did they bother asking how I wanted it done?

We spoke with the manager and told her that the food was terrible and we were leaving.  No response or apology. I don't think they really care.  There are lots of good places to eat - avoid this place.  I'd give it a negative if I could."}
{"text":"Had lunch here last week great service and friendly staff. Place was a little slow but food arrived quickly and was very good had the beet and goat cheese salad with chicken and friend had a burger. Both were a good price and had some excellent taste. Like the salads here better than milestones. Prices are better here."}
{"text":"A few years ago this would have easily been a 2 star.  They have improved a few things on their menu.  Their wings are probably one of my favorite and they have not changed since I started having them in like 1989.  Their burgers are always good.  What do you expect here.  You don't order stupid things like steak and fish here.  Anyone who complains about a steak ordered here really needs a reality check.  Do you order Osso Buco at Chucky Cheese?  No!  So dont order stupid things at these types of restaurants.  Stick to the classics.  Burger, wings, club sandwich, appetizers etc."}
{"text":"The service was much better than last time I came here a year ago. Service was fast and the staff was very caring. They came every ten minutes to check if everything was OK. 

I got the XMAS Burger which was a pretzel bun, two Turkey patties, caramelized onions, crispy onions, bacon and lettuce. It was absolutely delicious. For only $14.99 you get a lot of food. My friends got the seafood pasta as well as the butter chicken that comes with roti and rice with walnuts. Everything was good for the price you pay. 

Their Christmas specials are going on right now for a party of 8 or more. Go and check it out :)"}
{"text":"Food was great. Lauren our server was friendly and just the right amount of attentive 

But the dirty ladies room and the loud noisy groups at the bar were a bit much

I'd be back but probably earlier in day."}
{"text":"My mom and I were looking for a simple and delicious meal tonight, Kelsey's definitely delivered. We were both super hungry up arriving and were promptly seated. The menu was very simple so it didn't take long to choose what we were going to eat. I ordered a portobello mushroom burger with sweet potato fries and my mom ordered a bbq chicken club with regular fries. The food took 15-20 minutes to be made which was fine as we had the opportunity to catch up. 

When it finally came we were in for a delicious treat. My burger was so moist and flavourful and the sweet potato fries came with a really nice aioli. My only tip is to keep the skewer in the burger as the mushroom gets really slippery and tends to slide right out of the bun. 

My moms burger was also really tasty and I loved the thickness of her fries it definitely made them seem fresh and homemade. During our meal I saw a sign that said sign up for their email and get a free dessert with the purchase of any adult entree. Don't be fooled by this as the email takes anywhere between 24-48 hours to get sent out which means you have to come back for your dessert. 

Regardless the meal is delicious and very reasonably priced, a must try for sure!!"}
{"text":"The area that this restaurant is in is pretty much a business lunch haven.  You got everything from fast food, to sit down all in a little area and have your pick of the crop depending on your mood.  Kelsey's is one of those in the bunch that's bidding for your business during lunch hours.

Kelsey's is pretty much well... Kelsey's.  It's cookie cutter out of the box generic food.  For the price, I'd probably go somewhere else.  You're talking about a 12 dollar burger with fries/soup/salad that's alright I guess.  I mean, it's better than a McDonald's or another fast food place, but it's not exactly the best thing you could get for the price.

A cool thing about this location is their 15 minute menu (or it's free).  Saying that... I wonder how much of this menu is served from a giant buffet tray that's ready to scoop your lunch into.  Great... I love mass made food.

If you're looking to sit down and have a fancy business meeting, ya I'd probably visit something like a Kelsey's here.  It is a nice atmosphere for a business conversation (minus the 90's pictures on the walls).  But is it the best value for the money?  Probably not... go somewhere else to get something tastier."}
{"text":"The food and service at this location are always great. Enjoyed the new nachos and fresh never frozen burgers. My wife had the never frozen fresh chicken fingers which she enjoyed also! 

Great job Kelsey's really enjoyed will be back soon!"}

{"text":"What a terrible experience we had at this Kelsey's on August 23. We were heading to a movie the Queensway and decided to hit the Kelsey's first. NIGHTMARE!

1.  We asked for a booth and were met with frowns of \"Oh we're too lazy to accommodate that\"
2.  We were never given cutlery and I had to get up to get it from another table.
3.  Our waitress didn't write down our order.
4.  As a result of #3 we never got our appetizer.
5.  The soups/salads all came out at different times.
6.  The main entrees came out while we were still eating our soups/salads.
7.  When we asked the person who \"served\" our entrees out about our appetizer she asked us to ask our \"server\" - WTF?

I would post the blonde idiotic waitress' name here if I knew it.  She needs to be fired."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night with 2 others, wish I had just went to DQ for dinner. Took a while to get our food we ordered the full nachos,wings and Thai chicken curry bowl. The nachos are a huge rip off. They bring a giant platter out but only put nachos around the outer edges... the Thai curry bowl was about 45min late... they apologized but once it arrived it was super watery and hardly flavoured. The chicken had good taste so you can tell it was just rushed out the door. 

Not impressed. Won't be back for mediocre flavourless food."}
{"text":"Reminder that this isn't a 5 star establishment. The service was good, the waitress was attentive. The food is pretty greasy bar food, but I really enjoyed the onions rings and I love the spinach dip! It used to be a lot better but it still has the taste, just the presentation was a little off. I'd probably go back if I was craving some greasy cheap food. 

Keep Eating,

{"text":"I'm really not sure what Cara group was going for here.  From the outside it looks a bit like trashy urban vibe.  Quite frankly it looks very much out or place in the neighbourhood.  There is no intimacy on the inside.  I wonder if they're trying too hard to be a Jack Astor's?  As for the food, there is no meaningful improvement over the old menu, although there are quite a few new items.  A very average burger at best for nearly $15.  Service was very slow despite the fact it wasn't busy.  Also, there is no longer 1/2 price wings on Thursday at this location only.  If noise, tacky decor, lack of any privacy, average food,etc.....is your thing......you might like this new reno."}
{"text":"Favourite Kelsey's out of all the Kelsey's out there. The service is great, drinks are always cold & refreshing, food is always hot & delicious, and just a good time. You absolutely can NOT go wrong with their burgers and their Doritos ranch chicken fingers. Oh and their spinach dip (& wanton nachos) are always a crowd pleaser! Love this place!"}
{"text":"I never regret coming to this Kelsye's because they always live up to my expectations and past impressions of their food and service. We ordered the following appetizers: shrimp & calamari popcorn, nachos, cheese quesadilla, spinach dip, and wings, and besides the wings, everything tasted great. Their smoked ham burger and Alfredo fettuccini pasta are very delicious, and will most definitely fill you up. The portions are huge, the prices are reasonable, and the staff is super friendly, as well as having all of the above in a clean, pleasant environment. What more could you ask for? Love this place and will definitely continue to come here often."}
{"text":"This Kelsey's is located at woodbine and highway 7 in the huge plaza near Moore's and Staples. A friend and I were hungry and in the area, so we decided to stop by here. I mean, who can go wrong with a chain restaurant like Kelsey's if you're extremely hungry?

Lots of parking, as soon as you go in, you're greeted - they're pretty polite. The restaurant though, surprisingly is quite small. We got a booth. The d√©cor is pretty general and normal, I love their framed hockey jerseys though - they're on point! The food is as good as any chain restaurant - the waitress came by to check on us several times and was very attentive.

During the winter, the patio is closed but I've been here on a different occasion in the summer and the patio is beautiful in the fall and the summertime! Towards the end, the bill was as expected but I didn't expect the server to ask me if I had a SCENE card! I don't but that's pretty cool you can get movie points at a Kelsey's.

Overall 3.5/5"}

We had 2 drinks and dinner( i had the moe burger and my friend had the portobello mushroom burger! They both were tasty no complaints, and the sweet potato fries were the best out of many restaurants!( good majority still uses  frozen fries).  Drinks were pretty expensive but good overall! Service was quick and polite! No complaints there"}
{"text":"This is an OK place to eat. Absolutely nothing fancy, rather your typical American Traditional Eatery. My daughter and I went there after her flag football practice on Thursday evening and conveniently the wings were 1/2 price. We ordered a large wings extra crispy with two dipping sauces and the usual trimmings. The wings themself were completely flavorless other than tasting like chicken. We also had Burgers and the Chip Truck Fries with the beef gravy on the side. The Burgers were good and cooked well, the fries just the right cut to be called \"chip truck\", whereas again the gravy lacked salt and flavor. Overall for the price we paid, we would have been way better off going to Moxies or Jack Astors."}
{"text":"Quick starters

Cold stale garliic bread

Good Fries

Chicken noodle soup - small bites and a small to medium portion - good enough to want more but not great with small portions of ingredients I would have liked it more hearty

Fish and chips are a classic along with the buffalo chicken

Shrimp and salmon was also good - well or
Prepared salmon great

Friendly service and pretty prompt

Couldn't finished our servings so size was great"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Kelsey's in a really long time. Their food used to be mediocre. My sister suggested coming here after a weeklong trip in HK and eating Chinese food. She craved a big burger. 

I won't lie, I was a little skeptical but decided what the heck. My sister is pretty trustworthy in her food choices.

And so, we ordered a bacon cheeseburger on a pretzel bun each. It was pretty damn good! Two beef patties with bacon and peameal bacon, cheese and all the toppings. The buns were really soft and nice, and the burger tasted awesome. Came with fries, but also had a choice to switch to a salad. 

The service was great too, the hostess was really friendly. I would come back to grab a burger."}
{"text":"Kelsey's is a place that you crave until you go and remember why you vowed, the last time, never to return. The menu changes often offering dishes that are unusual but crave worthy.

Some of the menu staples are always reliable. Such as, my favourite, the four-cheese spinach dip with baked pita chips. Last night, for a main entree, I had their gluten-free tomato basil penne. Slightly heavy on the sauce but made with fresh goat cheese and spinach. Good enough to eat but not overeat.

For dessert, their featured deep-fried Twinkie was disappointing. Not only was it tasteless but I missed that crunch that comes with breaking the fried batter outer shell. My pal had their PB&J brownie sundae (which is big enough for 2-3 people to share) and was underwhelmed by the combination of flavours.

Their drink menu is varied and has crave-worthy choices but the drinks, themselves are unreliable. My pal ordered the same drink twice and received two very different products.

It's a good place for groups and based purely on the crave-worthy menu I will probably return. However, yesterday's visit was underwhelming."}
{"text":"Food is too expensive for what it's worth. You're not going to be blown away that's for sure. Used to be a regular here, service is great! However, the food....mehh..."}
{"text":"It was actually quite a easy going Saturday night when me and my girlfriend came in. We were seated near one of the big screens in the dining area. England and Italy were playing. Our server was very, very nice and tentative. 

We started off the night with a whopping plate of Kelsey's Wonton Nachos ($13.99), honestly, they were heavenly!!! It came with two dipping sauces (sour cream and salsa), the wonton wrappers were deep-fried then seasoned with some sort of spicy cheesy powder before getting slathered with chunks of beef, lettuce, tomato, and nacho cheese sauce. God it was so good. 

For our individual meals, I got the Cracked Peppercorn Burger with sweet potato fries ($14.79), the burger came with a big hulking knife to hold it together with two extra crispy onion rings on top. I was grateful for that knife because I couldn't even pick the burger up without it falling apart. The burger itself, is a monster, 2 burger patties with a slice of swiss cheese on each, 1 slice lettuce and 2 slices of tomato, condiments (ketchup, mustard & relish) came on the side. The sweet potato fries were delicious and it came with a spicy mayo dipping sauce. My girlfriend got the chicken fingers ($13.99) with regular fries, gravy and coleslaw as sides. The chicken fingers were breaded and deep-fried to perfection. The chicken fingers came with plum sauce that actually tasted homemade instead of store bought. 

Service was really quick and effective. Our server checked up on us quite often, even asked us if we needed anything and at the end, even asked if we wanted dessert, but sadly we were way too, too full to eat anymore. It was a good night, would definitely come back for something smaller and have enough room for dessert."}
{"text":"The waitress was realy nice.I caring and helpful
I had wings was good I found back again"}
{"text":"Finished our company golf tournament here last night. The servers were very attentive to our party of 20 buy that would be the only reason to return. I like Kelseys as a chain but the bar and kitchen staff hit singles not homeruns last night. When you pour a Guinness, pour half then wait for the head to subside. Then and only then do you fill it up. One quarter of the glass as foam just doesn't cut it. I'm not expecting the little shamrock on the foam but if you serve it, serve it the way it's suppose to be served. Others that had pitchers of cold Keiths White didn't complain like me but it's hard to screw up a pitcher of draft. I usually get the tasty peppercorn burger. My boss was having a Guiness too and suggested I try with him the steak and Guiness skillet. Here's a little tip to the kitchen staff. A skillet is served hot, sometimes dare I say sizzling. Luke warm steak stew and cool mashed potatoes are just boring. I watched others devour racks of ribs, wraps and burgers with envy and distain. \"At least it's tasty,\" said my boss. Meh!"}
{"text":"We went around 2:30 on a Sunday afternoon.  We waited over 5 minutes to be seated, and the restaurant was not busy. Honestly, the food and drinks were decent but the service was so bad that I can't give it more than 2 stars. I guess they were understaffed but I don't think that's an excuse."}
{"text":"I was given one of those dine-anywhere gift cards and decided to use it at Kelsey's. Overall it was a typical franchise restaurant experience... food was good, service was standard, and prices were decent. I ordered the peppercorn burger which was delicious - the 2 onion rings that came on top were more decoration, but the burger itself was juicy and well-seasoned. I would definitely recommend it if you're in the mood for a good burger! For dessert I'd highly recommend the funnel cake fries with strawberry sauce and vanilla ice cream :)"}
{"text":"We came in for lunch on a Saturday and the place was empty. We asked for a booth and he sat us at one that the cushions were held together with duct tape even though there were 5 others available. 

The pictures and memorabilia on the walls had a good layer of dust all over it.

Our order was taken in good time (chicken fingers and nachos) but it took 20+ mins to get. 

Our server was Nicky and she was great and the food was good and as we expected. It just seems like maybe there is a management issues. 

If it weren't for Nicky and the reliable food, I would have scored this location lower."}
{"text":"My family typically enjoys our visits to Kelsey's. Our last visit was not up to the usual standard. Upon brining our concerns to management, we received very prompt and caring attention. I am most impressed how seriously management took our feedback!! I look forward to visiting this branch on another day."}
{"text":"Wow, the music was so loud we couldn't speak. I don't want to sound like an old grouch, as I am only 40, but wtf...... After waiting 15 minutes for our table and struggling to have a conversation, we decided to ditch. To many near by choices, to be forced to tolerate the poor environment"}
{"text":"It's not bad. The party was itty-bitty and the price was around 10-12 dollars. Cheese was added upon request (extra). Probably won't be getting this again."}
{"text":"Second visit for Friday lunch today.  The experience was still decent.  There was a new menu.  I ordered a Messy Beef Burger.  The burger lived up to it's name."}
{"text":"Chicken Fest had some lovely offerings and after the Szechwan chicken bite, I tucked into the Thai Chicken Curry bowl. Great music in the bar area & good service with cold pints. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my friend and her boyfriend. I ordered gluten-free tomato basil penne, which is a new menu item and my friend got the buffalo chicken potato skins which was a new flavour as there were other potato skins on the menu previously. We shared a dessert which was go nuts donuts, which is warm donuts stuffed with Nutella and sprinkled with icing sugar. The waiter was nice enough to bring us both the English toffee caramel sauce and peanut butter sauce when we asked for both since we could not decide which one was better.

I did like the food, but everything on the menu looked quite expensive for lunch, I didn't really see any lunch specials and there was a lack of vegetarian options. There were vegetarian dishes, but it was severely limited, so you'd be stuck with whatever they offer on that option rather than having anything to pick from. The restaurant is very focused on meat, all four salads on the menu contained a heavy amount of meat. If they could improve their menus, I think I'd give it a better rating. Also, I was looking forward to trying some new advertised dishes on a Kelsey's promo that I got in the mail, but almost none of those items were available at this location, so I was disappointed because I already knew what I wanted to order thinking they'd have it. I've been here numerous times as I live close by and I even once held a birthday party in the past here, in which the experience was quite pleasant. It's nice to come here at night whether for dinner or late night appetizers with a drink. I would return and would recommend it to others, but would not specifically recommend."}
{"text":"Came for the half price wings and beer after a volleyball game. For a late Thursday night, the wait was pretty long for a group of 8 roughly 30 min.

When we finally got seated, we ordered our drinks and waited a little longer. The drinks were average in price, but I feel like could've  been a little cool. The temperature it came in was a little to warm that the taste is not as refreshing as it normally does. No big deal, we got water as well and that was filled with ice.

The chicken wings were amazing. I got the sea salt and pepper, and i must say that it is a must try.  The half price makes it even taste a little better. Hey had other flavors but this is my go to specialty at Kelsey's.

The waitress was a weird one. She rushed us to get out since her shift was over. She was persistent to give us the bill even when we were ordering more beer. I was annoyed a little bit since we wired so long only to be rushed by a staff done for the night.

I've been to this Kelsey's many times and hasn't had any bad experiences. So the 3 star mark is a neutral since it's my first ok experience and first review if the restaurant. I will be back to make sure I get those chicken wings again."}
{"text":"I came in for the Wednesday promo - cheap burgers and $5 appetizers. When they first had this promotion, Kelsey's was under a different branding. They served the burger in a pretzel bun, the burger patty tasted good and the $5 appetizer was great! I thought that $5 for calamari was an amazing price! However, after the rebranding to \"Original Roadhouse\", I found the burger patty to be very small (there were two, but it was much smaller than the bun), and it tasted like something I could get at Harvey's. The calamari was not good either-  the calamari breading kept falling off. It was terrible. Service is alright but I would rather go to Harvey's next time if I want to eat a subpar burger."}
{"text":"Food and service both are just about average. They have a pretty decent choices in the menus, though largely burgers and western roadhouse meals. Prices are upper end of average. Ambiance is moderate, not too rundown."}
{"text":"It's unfortunate. We have always had a decent experience here with good waiters (Jeff is a good one to have). But this was a baddie. Food was pretty miserable and they had the audacity to offer dessert before actually eating dinner....?? Too bad. I liked this place for what it \"was\"."}
{"text":"I went tonight for dinner and I was very disappointed and annoyed by the service. I was not impress by the portion which was very small. The waitress was not paying much attention to our table. I waited at least half an hour for her to take my empty plate and even more to get a glass of water. I left the restaurant unhappy and hungry. I highly doubt i'll go back to this location again."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a zero, I would. I'm not sure if I ordered a jar of ice and got lucky with a shot of sangria or a jar of sangria with extra ice without asking for it. When I was asked how my drink was, I told them politely that it's a bit too much ice. The server said she'd ask what she could do for me. The manager came back right away and explained that this is how a sangria is done at Kelsey. I've been to Kelsey many times and ordered the same sangria from this branch before. I really liked how it WAS made and purposely came back this time for it. When I told the manager that the past sangrias I've had at Kelsey didn't have that much ice, I was rudely told that they were all made incorrectly the previous times and he emphasized countless times that I'm not getting any less booze from it. 
1.  I never complained about the amount of booze.
2. The kind of explanation and attitude given by the manager was very demeaning. I'm not sure where they got their recipe or where in the world they found such gigantic ice scoops
 as I was told that they only used two scoops of ice.
3. If you're looking for a huge maison jar of ice for Instagram, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"We were shopping, I had gift cards, we were hungry and, more importantly, thirsty for a day off beer. 
It's a chain restaurant so not going into detail.
Server was enthusiastic and efficient. 
Our shared bacon cheeseburger was not that great although the overall bacon flavor was delicious. 
Side salad average. The Missus loved their bacon cheddar soup.
Pound of S&P wings to go and they were just ok too.
Beer, cold and perfect.

Overall, was thankful we had gift cards."}
{"text":"I visited this Kelsey's on a Sunday night as a last resort as everything else was closed by the time I was heading out. Even though they were closing in 20 mins they were okay with me coming in. 

Upon looking at the menu I noticed that their menu has changed quite a lot (I last visited a Kelsey's 3 years ago). Most of my favourite items have been removed so I was forced to try something new which isn't exactly a bad thing. 

I ordered the Wonton Nachos to start. The dish was okay, but I can definitely tell you I've had better and would skip this next time. I found the Nachos to be very greasy (I think they freshly fry the \"wontons\"). The dish did also come with a topping of Ground Beef, although the flavour was nice, it did smell a little bit. 

As the main course I had the Chicken Fajitas, these were the star of the night they were phenomenal! The Chicken came out on a sizzler, which is expected when you order Fajitas but unlike many other places I've been too they were very nicely seasoned and moist. The only gripe I had was the amount of tortillas they give, I was given 3 which is a ludicrously low amount for the quantity of chicken I was given, although they didn't have a problem giving me more; I felt shy after asking 3 times for more LOL! 

With Kelsey's new menu offerings I would definitely go back again and would recommend it to other people!"}
{"text":"Honestly I am not a fan of Kelsey's but here I am writing about it since I did check this one out. I admit the new layout and decor intrigued me! 

There is outdoor and indoor seating, I opted for the patio since it was good weather. The menu I felt was overpriced for the quality of the food. I wasn't overly disappointed at least! I got the Messy Goat Sandwich (12.99$ I think) with fries, my sister got the Asian Chicken Noodle Bowl (15.99$) and for dessert we were tempted by the Go Nuts Donuts (7.99$). I also tried the Old Fashioned Pink Lemonade (7.99$). 

So overall, food was average and the type of food on the menu isn't anything overly special. Service was meh. Nothing to brag about, although I admit the food took awhile to arrive and even getting water took 10 minutes.. =_= yes it was pretty sad!

Would I come back? Not really, I mean its great they have daily drink specials but none appealed to me. It's great they redecorated the place but please improve on service before I can say its a decent place. And the price doesn't equal the quality of food, just saying.."}
{"text":"Waited awhile at the door to be sat. 
Then the server was complaining about her section about how she has to come to us and be out on patio. 
The server did not seem to be paying attention nor did she care to be serving us. 
The food took awhile. My boyfriend order the Cool Doritos buffalo fingers with fries, they aren't what they were hyped up to be, his fries were stale and fingers weren't hot 

I got the Asian sesame chicken salad. Had it before else where and loved it. Here the salad was old looking, the lettuce was wilted and soggy, chicken was cold. 
Server never directly asked us how everything was. Never came back for refills on our beverages. 

Disappointed.
The restaurant itself was comforting and well set up. Very spacious."}
{"text":"This food here is quite good. Started with the Spinach dip and I had the cod fish and chips for the main. Both were really good. My partner had the Thai shrimp curry bowl which was also quite good!"}
{"text":"I've been here before and the service has been okay at best.

I went with my boyfriend last weekend for dinner and it was pretty bad. The restaurant wasn't busy and it took 6 minutes for a waiter to come and take our drink order (I'm a server at a different restaurant, rule if thumb it's supposed to be less than a minute). Our drinks took forever to come (2 pops).

One thing I was impressed by was the manager did come by and ask if we needed anything cause our server hasn't been to out table for a while. We got our food, and it was very good. 

The host was extremely friendly and helpful. Probably moreso than our server."}
{"text":"Everything about it was mediocre. The wait times were a bit long - we waited avoid 20 mins for a starter Caesar salad.

Boyfriend has the steak and I had the chicken.

Nothing was great, and nothing was terrible. Overall an okay visit."}
{"text":"Love it here! The food is always good & servers always helpful. It's great for casual dining/drinks and also for groups!"}
{"text":"I work in the area and have come here with co-workers several times over the last couple of years.  The food is yummy and the menu has a variety of dishes.  One major problem -- The service is sooooo slow.  Every single time we've been there we were late getting back to work due to slow slow service from beginning to the end.  A little tip, do not sit on the patio, they tend to forget about you out there.  Do not go there if you only have an hour for lunch -- you need 2 hours minimum."}
{"text":"We went here about a month or 2 ago. The service was ok, little sluggish. But the thing that earned this only 2 stars was the so called pulled pork sandwich i ordered. I should have known not to order this particular item at kelseys, however they claimed it was pretty good so I went for it. 
And then I tasted Dijon mustard and cheese. couldnt taste any pulled pork though.The pork was dry and unseasoned. no bbq sauce unlike every other pulled pork sandwich i have had.
If they can spoil a dish as simple as this , i dont expect they can do much better with anything else on the menu. 

Not going back unless its someones birthday and they have this as their favorite restaurant for some reason."}
{"text":"Just left Kelsey's, and they use to be one of my favourite spots to go to. However, the last two visits were absolutely horrible. I sat at the bar both times and had the same bartender. Both times i waited 15 mins to order my first drink. Then after was completely ignored and no one asked if i wanted another or how i was doing. Instead the two bartenders gave my friend and i dirty looks. We felt so uncomfortable that we wanted to leave. But we couldnt because they didnt even check on us and ignored us when we tried to talk to them. Instead we had to ask the hostess. Once we got the bill our server didnt even say anything to us just gave us the bill. Needless to say, since i work in the industry i still tipped and she didnt even acknowledge it. This will be the last time i visit, which is a shame since i did enjoy the place. Youre better off going to milestones right across"}
{"text":"Full disclosure: The only reason why I came here was cause of the Scene card promotion, where if you visit participating restaurants you'll get 50x the Scene points if you end up spending at least a certain amount. Therefore you can kind of guess my expectations weren't too high on Kelsey's.

I visited here on a Sunday night, and the place was practically empty. A little bit unexpected, but given the events that weekend I guess chain restaurants took a bit of a hit.

I've been to Kelsey's before so I had a decent idea on what to order. I ended up ordering a popcorn shrimp and an alfredo chicken fettucine. The popcorn shrimp had a lot of \"popcorn\" but not a lot of shrimp, as in the shrimp pieces were quite small. The alfredo chicken fettucine was quite good, in fact it was actually better than I thought. Definitely a dish I'd recommend if you're stumped on choices.

Service was poor. My server paid way more attention to another table with kids than my family, and she gave the sense to me that she didn't like her job at all.

I've had excellent experiences with some Kelsey's branches more, but unfortunately this wasn't one of them. It wasn't bad, but considering I'm in the food mecca of Markham, nothing here would entice me from returning, barring another crazy promotion."}
{"text":"The food was good and the service was pretty good as well too.

I took a business associate there because he likes burgers, and I need to eat gluten free, so I had one without a bun.

The food was quite good.  I had been before, but the restaurant has been rebuilt.

My associate enjoyed the food as did I.

Highly recommended for someone looking for a good lunch.  Clean restaurant, friendly, music a little loud, food to the table in a reasonable amount of time."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this Kelsey's location.

It is a very nice and clean looking restaurant.

There are lots of tables and the staff is very friendly.

I've been to several locations and what I like about this chain is that the food is consistently good.

I always have a burger.  Bacon and cheese and carmelized onions.  It's always good.

I like the laid back atmosphere and the staff always seem nice and calm.  Nice place to go.

Kelsey's offers several gluten free options, but if you need to seriously avoid gluten, let them know and avoid food that is cooked in the deep fryer.  It's not dedicated to gluten free.

Always a good meal!"}
{"text":"We usually come to this location for late dinner because their portion is huge and some of the dishes are pretty good.

However, our most recent visit, as the pictures I provided, we had some greasy looking deep fried dishes. They looked as if they got soaked with oil like a sponge. Maybe the deep fried oil wasn't hot enough when the guy put the spring roll and the shrimps in? I don't know what happen but we were kind of disappointed and hoped they will do better next time...

As for my dish, I had their fish and chips, and it was cooked it just right. Maybe some people like to eat thinner crusted but I like their style. The fish inside was very juicy and hot.

I hope they improved their deep frying skills when we visit them next time...."}
{"text":"Nice new Kelsey's with nice staff and all the usual Kelsey's fare.  Nice bar area, plenty of parking, and so far not crazy busy like other locations."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. I thought the new renovations were up to date and trendy compared to the older look. It seems like they are attracting more of the younger crowd as oppose to families. 

The service was great. Our server was attentive and answered all of my questions and recommend only the best on their menu. We had the chicken fingers to start. It came with different flavours to dip in. They were really good but small portion. Then we had the fajitas for two with steak. They were really good actually. Really good toppings and sauces to make your own fajitas. However the serving for sour cream and salsa were a little small. Not a big deal though, they brought more anyways. Unfortunately we were too full for dessert but they looked really good on the menu.

I would definetly recommend Kelsey's Queensway to anyone and return."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best restaurants in Oakville. The waiters and waitresses are really nice and I've never had any problems with the service. The food comes out QUICK! It can get a bit noisy at times, but that's to be expected since the location is quite large. I would highly recommend the cheese and spinach dip. Try it with the flatbread, its divine.

The only criticism I can think of is that there are not many vegetarian options available. I think this could help bring in customers, since Oakville is in many cases a health-conscious demographic."}
{"text":"Love coming here for Thursday's All Day Half Price Wings! :) The servers at the Bar area are fantastic and attentive (service can be slow during peak times but this applies to all restaurants)! Definitely will keep coming back in the future!"}
{"text":"After my whole month trip at Japan, what I have learned from Japan is that the actual dishes look exactly the same or better looking than the official pictures of the food from the menu or advertisement. At Kelsey, there is significant difference between the official picture and the actual product (the actual dish looks a lot worse than the official picture). The Brownie Pop is a perfect example. (see my pictures)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been sitting here for more than 45mins and none of my order showed up. So I asked the waiter, he is the MOST HORRIBLE waiter I've ever seen. I wasn't impolite, I was just asking, and he was like, it was not my fault, it's the cook's responsibility, I did my best. And gave me an attitude which surprised me a lot.  If the manager is reading this, please fire this waiter. Check your schedule for June 26, he was the one took care the right hand section. We were sitting at a booth at the very end."}
{"text":"I had a great time here with some friends for a patio meal with some end of summer sangria! Truth be told, I am a chain food restaurant snob, just not a fan. However, I was impressed with the quick service, attentive staff and over all delicious meal. 
We ordered two pitchers of red wine sangria, it was yummy but so obviously watered down it tasted more like fruit punch than the tart fruity drink I know and love. I ordered the sonoma salad with chicken, it was good, fresh and crisp with a light dressing. The chicken was tender without being over cooked, very pleasant. 
The reason for the missing star? The pricing. It is expensive for what the food actually is. I paid close to fifteen dollars for a salad. That just seems crazy to me. Also there is a limited health food selection, this is an aspect of the menu that is very important to me.. I like to have a choice if I do decide to be more health conscious. 
The verdict? I would come back if a friend suggested it but I do feel like there are better options out there for a meal."}
{"text":"The chef here has a very different definition of rareness. I asked for black on blood (Chicago style) for my steak and it came out pretty white and stiff. Hubby ordered rare and they were the same level of whiteness abs stiffness, borderline beef jerky.  Good steak seem to have been broiled right through.  The acoustics are really bad in this restaurant. Everyone seems to be talking really loudly and the servers can't hear a thing. The manager came to ask about the food. We expressed our concerns and he did nothing."}

Pros:
Friendly service
Plenty of seating space

Cons:
Food is very meh at best

Let's get this out of the way first.  I rarely eat at places like Kelsey's, Jack Astors, Casey's, etc.  The only reason we were here was I had a gift card I received from work.  I'm not a big fan of chains honestly to begin with.  

This Kelsey's location is pretty spacious.  It's the perfect place for a family after seeing a movie at the Cineplex next door.  Walking in, we're immediately greeted by a friendly hostess.  When you come to a place like this, expect friendly service with a smile.  It's in the manual of all these types of places.  As long as you're not being a jerk, you'll have a pleasant experience service wise.  

We ordered the fish and chips, chicken apple pecan salad, and a kids meal for our little one which was a pasta dish.  Food doesn't take too long to come out but it wasn't terribly busy when we were there.  

Fish and chips:  I wasn't too impressed with this one.  The batter on the fish was way too crunchy/hard and the fish itself was very mushy.  My work place cafeteria is not the best by far, but even they made a better fish and chips.  The fries were OK, but could not save the dish.

chicken apple pecan salad:  This one according to my GF was much better. There's a lot of variety in the salad which works for and against it.  You get a bunch of different tastes, but not enough of the actual greens because they have so much items to put in. The breaded chicken pieces were pretty good though.

Kid meal:  The fact that my little one took 2-3 bites of the pasta and didn't want anymore said it all.  She usually loves pasta.  I took a bite myself and knew why.  Pasta was way overdone, and barely any sauce.  No taste at all.  The salad that came with pasta was good. 

I want to like this place better because of the great service.  Our meal just wasn't up to par unfortuantely."}
{"text":"We came here on a Thursday night right before a long weekend. 

The restaurant was super busy with a lot of families. 
The service was pretty good, and the food was average. 

I've noticed that their menu is very heavily meat focused, which makes it a little difficult for the vegetarians in our family to find good options. 

Our party of 4 ordered a 1/2 size nachos as a starter, 
the Brochetta, Veggie Quesadilla, and Chicken Strips for our mains. 

Heads up, the fries that come with the meals are not the best, no matter what location I go to, they always seem overdone and limp. 

Their Mild Buffalo Sauce that comes with the chicken strips, is also a tad bit sweet."}
{"text":"We came here with a group of five on a Friday night, the service was average, as was the food.  They have recently changed their menu, and they do not offer as many vegetarian options as they used to.

I also came here on a Saturday afternoon for lunch, sadly it was completely empty inside. 
The service and the food were both below average."}
{"text":"Its been awhile since I last came to this restaurant. I'm glad I did. Place is very busy and packed. Thursdays are half off on wings.

We started off with flat pan nachos and boy its huge. Shared these among 10 people. Then had 4 different flavors for wings, Apple butter Bbq, Sea salt & black pepper, honey garlic and Sweet & spicy thai chili. I enjoyed the apple butter bbq most which has a sweet, tangy and smoky taste.

Cheap and good food. Will come back to try other interesting items in the menu next time."}
{"text":"I only came here again because I had a gift certificate, so many a chance to redeem themself... nope 

The service was great, the waitress was amazing.

The food...was crap! I had the chicken quesadilla. There was literally no chicken or cheese...it was alllll onions!

I'm so done eating here...unless they get a new damn cook!"}
{"text":"Kelsey's is good not great just good. The food is what you would expect for what you pay. I've had their chicken wings, peppercorn burger and fish sandwich all are good and I feel like you get your money's worth. The chicken wings aren't the best but I feel like I'm. Really picky when it comes to my chicken wings so my opinion will be different then most peoples. I will say the chicken wings at Kelsey's are better then at 3 brewers so they have that going or them. 

The staff is always friendly and quick. I cannot complain about the service as it's always better then a lot of similar restaurants. 

I will be back to Kelsey's as they've never disappointed me in the past and I can always know what to expect from them when I go."}
{"text":"I waited at the front of restaurant for almost 10 minutes waiting for a host or someone to welcome me and seat me. I watched the waitress go to the ONE table she was serving, not glance at the front at all, and then go to the bar to go onto her cellphone and start texting someone. I actually had to approach her and ask to be seated. After that she was okay to be honest, and the food wasn't so bad, but if it's going to be like this, it should be FAR cheaper than the prices listed on the menu. WAY over priced for that quality of food."}
{"text":"The steak and Chipotle shrimp was fantastic. I strongly recommend the NEW Kelsey's...although it's a bit pricey"}
{"text":"Haven't been to a Kelsey's in probably years.

Got a \"Bigwhat\" stuffed burger with a broccoli cheddar soup. The soup was great, thick creamy and satisfying. The stuffed burger was very messy to eat and was well-made, though I don't feel like there was much flavour when I bit into the burger. Overall, I was satisfied with the food in terms of quality and presentation. Service was very friendly and nice. We were however seated in an area that felt.... very empty.

My bigger concern was the price. I don't feel like the high prices at Kelsey are justified, since for the same price I could be eating some very good food at some of the very best places in town."}
{"text":"My family and I had dinner here tonight. The service was great. The food and variety was uninspired. The kids menu consisted of a cheeseburger, chicken fingers, cheese pizza, or pasta with marinara or Alfredo. Unfortunately, my children ordered the pizza. They didn't have pepperoni or other typical toppings, just cheese. I suspect the reason is because it is a frozen pizza like the ones you buy at the grocery store, except waaay more expensive. My wife and I had the balsamic chicken. It was tasty. The mashed potatoes are clearly made from a box and the steamed veggies are not fresh. Overall, this is another pre-fab menu that doesn't require a chef, just preparers. Far too much $ for what you get."}
{"text":"Waitress was pretty and friendly. The spinach dip was delicious! But the pasta was okay."}
{"text":"Went there for late night dessert and ordered the trio. Oooh! It was way below average. Too much fried stuff on the plate, and way too sweet. I love sweet stuff and have a huge sweet tooth, but the deep fried brownies was just TOO much. And so was their peanut butter with ice cream - too much sweets. 

The service was also so slow. We wanted to get the bill (it was nearing 12 am) but no one around. At all. We waited 20 minutes to wave someone down to get the bill"}
{"text":"We arrived at 9:30 pm on a weeknight. The restaurant was not busy, but we ended up standing in the waiting area for 10+ minutes. I think part of it is due to the design of the restaurant. There are walls that obstruct the view of the waiting area from all sides. Not having a hostess is probably another reason. 

We ordered the spinach artichoke dip with pita chips and wings (still half price wings on Thursdays with a purchase of a drink for each order of wings). Spinach artichoke dip was very good, although the portion sizes have gone down to half its original size as compared to a couple years ago. Pita chips were crispy and hot when served.

We ordered the wings in two flavours, bbq and honey garlic. We liked the honey garlic more than the BBQ. The BBQ flavour was really strong and overpowering, but the honey garlic was well-balanced. 

The three items came up to $30, which is not bad for 2 people with the amount of food we got. We will definitely come back. Be prepared to wait a little bit before being seated."}
{"text":"I don't know why I keep thinking that maybe next time the food will be better and I go back...Its not!
After a long absence from this place due to poor service and food in the past the Kelsey's IN Georgetown lived up to its reputation once again. We went there at dinner and ordered Nacho's and wings. Easy right? Hard to mess up right? Well surprise surprise, Kelsey's managed to screw it up! Nachos were over cooked and burnt and the mild wings with ranch sauce came with hot sauce and blue cheese.

I might as well stayed home and had KD.

WE WILL NEVER GO BACK TO THAT RESTAURANT EVER AGAIN AND I SUGGEST YOU DO THE SAME!!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great and the food was excellent.  My server Jack helped me pick out the balsamic chicken and it was delicious.  The $4 corona is a good idea and will definitely come back for that deal."}
{"text":"My three colleagues and I went there for lunch today before a meeting.  The restaurant was half full.

We ordered our food at 12:45 and told the server than we had to be gone by 1:30.  

We didn't order anything crazy ... burger and sandwiches.

Our food was served to us at 1:20!  If there was going to be an issue, she should have told us.

I ordered the peppercorn burger, no cheese or lettuce, and fries.  I was given the regular burger with onions and lettuce and a salad.  Nope, that's wrong.  So she came back with the same burger but with fries.  Wrong again!  With ten minutes to spare, I scraped the lettuce and onions off and ate it.

Not a great place for service :("}
{"text":"Came here around 5pm on a Sunday. Pretty quiet. Ordered ribs and wings combo and cheddar broccoli soup with baked potatoes. Food was great, Service was great and quick."}
{"text":"Standards seem to be dropping at Kelsey's. I have been to this Queensway location since in my undergrad days. I was not impressed with the service last Saturday. It was a humid Saturday evening and we chose to sit inside. It was quite empty to be honest. There was nice music playing and we got seated immediately. 

I really wanted a vanilla milkshake. I asked the waiter and he informed me that he was sorry but they didn't offer it on their menu anymore because it was not a best seller. He didn't offer me any alternatives and I ended up drinking a tall glass of iced water instead. Healthier-yes it was but I really wanted that milkshake. I was disappointed that he didn't ask me/provide options in place of the absent milkshake. 

I ordered the fish and chips.
The food looked greasy and delicious but I found it quite bland. There was two pieces of huge haddock which made me happy. It was nice and crispy however it was so tuff. The fish was not flavourful at all and it was quite hard to eat. It costs around $15 which is standard but it didn't satisfy the foodie in me. I decided to have dessert elsewhere because of the experience. But the waiter did check up on us quite often which was appreciated."}
{"text":"Generally I like the theme and modern vibe of the restaurant, it's a great atmosphere for a group get together. The menu selection is pretty classic western food, and their quesadillas are pretty great. As it is kind of a typical white people restaurant, the flavor in most dishes is minimal and often bland, I had some kind of sea food pasta and it tasted like they dumped a bunch of milk and butter into something that could have been exciting. Up your seasoning game Kelsey's and maybe I'll come back."}
{"text":"Look, I know it's a chain.  And I know that service is always hit and miss wherever you go....   

Having said that, Becca and Lisa are awesome.   If you never been to cheers and always wanted to go where everyone knows your name, this is the place to be.  Sit at the bar, do shot and feel at home!"}
{"text":"The food was perfect and location was nice. Employees were nice and helpful, but after lunch we treated the way that we should leave when we were done. That was kind of rude. How ever the restaurant was not crowded at all and lots of empty tables.... Not decent behavior"}
{"text":"Kelsey's corporate office: WHAT. THE. HELL?! 

This location has bright lights, bright colors & absolutely no rhyme or reason to any of it. 

The atmosphere is loud & trying to carry on a conversation is difficult. 

Prices of menu items have been increased by at least $1.50 - $2.00. So their Four Cheese Spinach Dip which is $9.99 at most locations it was $11.99 here. 

Ok, so about that dish.. I went after a movie with a party of four. The exterior is so different & brightly lit that you couldn't even tell it was a Kelsey's. 

We were seated right away but the server took a while to come. When she finally came we placed drink & food orders. I explicitly told her \"I want the Spinach Dip, half pita chips baked & half pita chips fried & I want it TO START.\" After fifteens minutes of waiting I realized that I wasn't going to be having the dip to start. When it finally came - it came with the rest of the food - it was a huge disappointment. 1. The pita chips were all baked; 2. The looked old, it was crusty & it looked like it had been siting under the heat lamp for long; & 3. It looked like someone dug into it before we got it. 

I didn't even touch it & asked the server to take it away. 

The service was TERRIBLE. Our server didn't even bring out the food. From the time our food was brought to us to when she came to check on us it was ~20 minutes. THAT'S when she took the ugly dip away & asked if I wanted something else. Everyone was almost finished eating by then - Really???? 

I have been to a few Kelsey's locations - now shut down (Brampton & Erin Mills) - & I'm sad to see that a Kelsey's like THIS is still stands. If it is successful I would be shocked. 

The menu items are limited. The ones they kept are the same as other non-brightly lot locations but just inflated & I can tell you you're wasting your money if you think it'll be better quality food - it's just the opposite.  Bad food, higher prices. 

I didn't eat anything that evening & had my drink. Friends also were not impressed & commented the portion sizes were smaller & quality was lacking - even on fries. 

I would never recommend this place. The convenience of its location to the theatre doesn't matter."}
{"text":"I truly enjoy this restaurant. I love the food, the atmosphere &, for the most part, the service. The Grand Park location is EXCEPTIONAL. 

I go there regularly with my boyfriend. Most the staff are very good at remembering regulars. Actually, it's quite impressive how they remember their customers. One manager, makes it a point to stop by tables & say hello to guests. This manager also remembers regulars & will make small talk if it's not too busy. That's amazing & why we come back; we always feel comfortable. 

I'm going to be realistic & say there are some staff that sometimes dampen the experience. Sometimes they're never visible & their quality of service is brutal. However, they are few & far between & one in particular, I have not seen around in a long time... So I'm not too sure about their status at Kelsey's.. But anyway, that doesn't matter in the big picture. 

The food is pretty good. I avoid ordering the calamari these days. They changed the kind they use. This kind no longer has the little squid bodies with tentacles, it's now large chewy, almost gummy, pieces that don't hold the batter well & seem soggy as a result. I'd rather the kind that are smaller in size & have the little squid bodies, THOSE hold the batter much better & therefore still have the crunch of the batter. 

I highly recommend the spinach dip. They offer a healthier option of baked pita but I always order half fried - tastes SO much better. 

I generally order the same items, their menu offers a good selection depending on what you want, but I like to stick with the following: 

1. Greek salad with grilled chicken: I recommend asking for dressing on the side. Sometimes it is really soggy - almost soupy - when the kitchen adds the dressing for you.
2. Grilled salmon: This too I will ask for the dill sauce on the side. Sometimes I will ask for no dill sauce, this dish can make due without it.
3. Balsamic chicken penne: No, I do not ask for the sauce on the side. But I will ask for an extra piece of chicken breast. 
4. Chicken quesadilla: Make sure to add guacamole. I always ask for sweet potato fries with the chipotle ranch mayo.

For dessert I recommend the Caramel Lava Cake, Funnel Cake fries or the Peanut butter cup. I am not a fan of the cheesecake or apple blossoms. 

When we eat there, we usually have regular three courses: appetizer, main, dessert. Our bill usually comes to $50-$60. With drinks MAYBE $70, but usually remains in the $60 range. 

If you're a regular like us, it's worth filling out the surveys for a free appetizer. Since then, our bills range $40-$50. It's well worth it. 

So to sum it up: FIVE stars all around for food & service."}
{"text":"Cute patio, the tacos were sogy not the greatest and server wasn't very nice. I was here before renovations the food wasn't the greatest either. Thought id give it another try"}
{"text":"Service was good.  The server was very professional and courteous.  The restaurant just got slammed - high school grad ceremony across the street just got out. It's Kelsey's so you expect pub grub. Four of the five meals we ordered were good.  Sadly, I ordered a steak. Chipotle shrimp sirloin.  Don't order the steak!!  Omg. Worst cut of sirloin ever. I mean ever. You know the tongue of an old pair of leather dress shoes that have been worn for years and years?  It would have better texture than the cut I had. Gross.  And naturally, the frozen veggies boiled to \"almost thawed\" were a nice touch. 
At any rate, good spot for pub grub and a pint. Typical for chain restaurants I would think. I won't order big there again, but I'd order the fish and chips or the Mac and cheese. Oh, and don't ask for a special request...it will be forgotten...could have been due to the slam, or order entry done wrong....meh..."}
{"text":"The wings are phenomenal.  I tried the apple butter bbq - it was really good - but the wongs themselves were cooked so perfectly, I regretted not ordering more for just myself.
I also had the thai seafood salad which had really nice flavors and well done. 
Service was prompt and friendly - no complaints!"}
{"text":"Food and service here are just as good as the other location I visit. Service was speedy and our party of two was very well taken care of. We both ordered a large garden salad to share, burgers and sides. My dining companion had not been to the restaurant before and had heard me rant and rave about kelsey's. When his meal arrived and he took a bite, his eyes rolled back into his head (seriously, it was that good)! When you're craving a juicy burger with fixings, this is the place to go! No pictures were taken as our food was instantly devoured. Maybe next time :)"}
{"text":"Menu has changed drastically since the 90's. Nonetheless, food options today are still pretty good. I normally come to eat a juicy beef burger whenever the mood strikes and their Big What more than satisfies! I've also had their chicken goat cheese Flatbread thrice. First time was a hit. Second time was taken to go and wasn't as good as expected. Third time was fantastic. I suggest dining in rather than doing take out. Sonoma salad is a good pick. Their fish burger is nothing to write home about.

Servers are friendly and some are more knowledgeable than others. During lunch hours, the establishment seems greatly understaffed! Sit near the kitchen and/or bar to be noticed, otherwise you'll be waiting for a long, long time!"}
{"text":"Ribs were better than expected; burger patty seemed a bit on the small side; wings are okay. The menu mentions if you register for alerts you'll receive a free appetizer - but what you don't know until you register is that they set a delay so you don't receive the offer until the next day. Maybe I'm overly sensitive, but that rubs me the wrong way. Unsubscribe. Also not the friendliest servers."}
{"text":"Mainly came here due to the proximity of the restaurant to the movie theatre and being able to get the \"movie and a dinner\" deal.

I decided to try their balsamic glazed chicken with mashed potatoes and steamed vegetables. So, my entree came with two chicken breasts completely soaked in the sauce with just a bit of mashed potatoes and veggies. I could not finish my meal because of the overbearing amount of the glaze on my plate. The mashed potato on the side tasted a lot better than anything and I would have preferred having that as my main to be honest. Tip: ask for the sauce to be on the side. 

Others at the table had the salmon entree and a steak with chipotle shrimp. Both really enjoyed their food and finished their meals. Hence 2 out of the 5 stars. 

I also happened to stumble upon a very interesting dessert they offered..Nutella filled donut bites...!!! How can you resist something like that?? So I ordered them and I did not expect to get so many, so definitely only get them if you're 2+ at a table or super hungry for some chocolate! They were really good, minus being very fried. And that is where my third star comes from! 

Service was pretty good; we were seated right away. Our waitress was really nice and would check up on us once in a while. It was pretty packed so it's a nice place to eat before watching a movie."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday night with my sister after she had finished work quite late. She was really hungry, so I told her that this Kelseys had recently opened. 

The restaurant is pretty big, so there's quite a bit of seating available. We were greeted right away by the hostess who was slightly unwelcoming and were given the option to sit at the bar or in the dining room. We decided to opt for the dining room and on the way there my sister almost slipped as there was water on the floor. She notified the hostess and our waitress about the spill and they reacted quite rudely. They have her an annoyed look, but wiped it right away thankfully. The music was quite loud in that area, so we switched over to the bar.

The music was still too loud for my sister, but we had a nice booth. Our new waitress (changed since switched to bar) was extremely nice and made sure we had a great time. I wasn't hungry, so I ordered a tea. My sister ordered their balsamic chicken and a Stella. The Stella came in a nice tall glass and definitely relaxed after work. She also really enjoyed her meal, so I was happy about that. I personally found that there was way too much sauce on the two chicken breasts, but it was to her taste. 

Overall, we had a great time here. Unfortunately, the service wasn't the greatest at first, but our actual waitress made up for the crappy start. The music is a bit loud all over the restaurant, but they were good songs playing so I was okay with it. I mean, it's a Kelsey's so I wasn't expecting high-end food from here. If you want to enjoy some bar food, watch some sports and have a drink, it's a good place in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Horrible experience!!!

I used to be a fan of Kelsey's but never again after this experience! Since it's renovation, my husband and I went for dinner after a hard week of work. I ordered the shrimp pad thai and my husband had wings and ribs. After a long wait, My husbands order came first and he offered me some of his meal as his food would get cold. I opened my cutlery and it was very dirty with dried food stuck on it. I showed it to our server and she brought me out another set of dirty cutlery with leftover food from a previous customer! I asked for the manager to bring this to his attention and to ask where my meal was. He apologized and brought my meal to me with another set of dirty cutlery!! Come on.....3 times in a row?!?

After he apologized again, he brought me cutlery for the 4th time that he just took out of the dish washer. By then, my husband was finished his meal, I was disgusted but decided to try my meal only to find a long blond hair in it!!! GROSS!! 

Who knows what kind of germs other customers have picked up!

Obviously, I lost my appetite. I returned it. No more apologies could compensate for the unsanitary and unhygienic food they serve and utensils they use. We didn't pay and will never ever go again!

Why renovate if Kelsey's cannot even get the basics of restaurant management correct.

Bottom line.....dine elsewhere!"}
{"text":"I've never really been a fan of the Kelsey's chain, but had a volunteer meeting here so not much of a choice to attend. 
In the years since I've been they have acquired a gluten free menu ... With 3 items. Pasta, steak and a salad. I asked if any of the appetizers could be made gluten free, as that's what the table wanted to order and I was told no. Flat out no. I understand if accommodations can't be made, but she could have been more polite about it. 
I ordered the pasta because I was hungry and it looked halfway decent. The taste was subpar. The noodles fell apart because they were overcooked, the goat cheese made no sense in the pasta and gave the whole meal a weird flavour and the meal itself was very expensive for what it was. 
I remember why I never go to Kelsey's. The only reason I gave it two stars is because the others seemed to enjoy their appetizers."}
{"text":"We came back here for a lunch type meal on a rainy saturday. We were later in the afternoon so it was pretty quiet and the manager was out front and opened the door for us and sat us in the bar after offering a choice.

We ended up splitting a pound of the sweet chili thai wings and the bbq chicken flatbread instead of opting for a full on lunch since it was later in the afternoon. The flatbread was quite good, my boyfriend really enjoyed it, and not too large for two people to share. The wings were good, nicely coated in breading and the sauce was good but I don't know if I'd get it again. Love me some honey garlic and thsi sauce didnt' really stand up to the wings.

Overall, great service and great food again. I'm consistently impressed with Kelseys and we'll keep coming back!"}
{"text":"The new Kelsey's look it was warm and inviting. The staff are responsive and on the ball even though this place is packed. Wine on tap is a great option however the wine menu is confusing and they've adopted the new five and eight let's cheap out our customers and squeeze more bucks. Given that beer hasn't changed in decades it's pretty insulting as a wine drinker. 

The food options are extensive and the specials are creative and affordable. Get off the wine greed bandwagon and I'll give you an extra star!"}
{"text":"Great service!  We sat at the bar and it wasnt too lould.

Love the wood interior and menu options were plenty.
We opted for the potato skins and chicken parmasian.  Portions were great and price fair.

Out waitress (didn't catch her name) was attentive and drinks were served and refilled right away.

For dessert we got the trio and it was awesome!!!  Priced a tad high for portion size...

1st time here and will be back!"}
{"text":"Went here today with my daughter. The place is very clean and the waitress was very nice. The order took a little long to come but the food was good. I would go back again."}
{"text":"Fantastic customer service is the only reason I'm bothering to review this place. They did screw up our order, but the manager came out and let us know the bill was taken care of and made sure we were all good. The food was nice. Standard sort of chain food. Service was good other than the SNAFU, but mistakes do happen. More than anything was so impressed by the managers reaction!"}
{"text":"I am a Kelsey's fan. While they don't quite stand out amongst other chains, they are consistent and have some unique food offerings...
Like the chicken fingers with caramel and pretzel bits that I tried during my last visit! They have a bit of a promo on right now with interesting takes on chicken fingers which rules for someone like me that orders chicken fingers more often than I probably should. They also had chicken Parmesan fingers (didn't try) and Cool Ranch Doritos fingers (which I had tried a few months ago.. Icky unfortunately) and while all of the ideas may not work, I love that they're trying to make this classic dish a little more interesting! 
The caramel fingers were certainly unique and very tasty. I wasn't too crazy about the pretzel pieces so I just picked them out. I would likely order them again if they stick around.
As for the location itself, I sat in the bar area and was served by the bartender - no complaints about the service, we were well tended to and everyone was friendly. 
Need to come back on a Thursday for half price wings!!"}
{"text":"This review is strictly for the Thursday Night 1/2 price Wings!
I love love LOVE wings, and Kelsey's are great. I wasn't expecting to like them so much since all the other fare on the menu is mediocre, but they have about 8-10 flavours and are a good size, too. 
They aren't the weird teeny wings, nor are they the jumbo radioactive wings. They aren't too fatty or full of weird nubs. 
I have gotten the lemon pepper and honey garlic, and both are awesome. 
$5 for a pound of wings--you can't go wrong there. Sometimes I order 2 lbs and then take 1lb home (since you can't get them Take Out, I work around that by getting a doggie bag and never intend on eating the 2lb in one sitting). Before I knew about the doggie bag option, I snuck in a tupperware container and then stealthily stuck wings into it and brought them home. Asking for them to go was way easier, but not nearly as fun. :)"}
{"text":"I expected so much more for Kelsey's. It was my first time there and had ordered the chicken tenders coated with Doritos. Worst mistake I made, ended up getting so sick. And the price was rather high."}
{"text":"Still a good place. They updated their menu for the better.  I will say that this might be the busiest resto in bolton on a Friday night so beware of very long wait times. Sometimes out the door."}
{"text":"I originally accepted lunch with a colleague whom I rarely see. A couple of hours later, my intern asked if I was good having Thai food with my team. I had to politely turn down going with them. 

Well, things changed. On Friday, my colleague had to cancel our lunch an hour before we had planned to meet. So, I felt like I needed to grovel with my two other colleagues to see whether I could get back into their good lunch books. Luckily, they took me back. They also changed venues and went with Kelseys.

I looked at the menu at the office before heading over there. The grilled cheese and soup combo looked wonderful on a rainy day. I also have a weakness for all-day breakfast items. My intern also pointed out that the restaurant has root beer floats. Excellent!

My intern drove us over to Kelseys, which is a five-minute drive from our office. The parking lot tends to get busy, as a number of eateries share the same lot and there's also an auto mall next door.

We walked in. It wasn't busy just before noon. We got a booth and looked at the menu.

All of us went with the brekkie poutine. Yep, we did the all-day breakfast. The brekkie poutine comes with two sunnyside up eggs, two types of bacon, mozzarella cheese, gravy, and fries. I also got the loaded cream soda. It comes with vanilla ice cream, your choice of vanilla or orange liqueur (I went with orange), and a maraschino cherry.

The brekkie poutine is huge! I came close to finishing it off, but left about a quarter of it. The fries had the perfect amount of saltiness, which complemented everything else. Sure, there weren't any cheese curds. However, the gravy and the gooey mozzarella worked well with everything. I loved the bacon and eggs, which made this dish perfect.

The loaded cream soda was delicious. The only downside was that I got a straw that was much shorter than the glass itself. Luckily, my glass of water came with a longer straw. I swapped out the straw and I was good.

My maraschino cherry was in the middle of my cream soda. I couldn't fish it out with the shorter straw. Additionally, I had to wait to enjoy the ice cream before I could get at the cherry. It didn't come with a stem, but it was worth retrieving and eating it in the end.

Kelseys has definitely improved its menu since I was last there. The drinks menu was impressive. My colleagues got honey peach tea lemonades. They looked delicious!

I'd come back here again. When the weather warms up, there is a patio that we'd like to try. I keep on forgetting to swipe my SCENE card, but this place accepts it.

Our server was friendly and prompt. We had little wait time for our beverages, drinks, and bill.

{"text":"I came to Kelsey's with my colleagues as a work outing.

They only had 1 server to cater the entire left side of the restaurant, we had to ask several times to get our water, and obviously no refills were provided for our soft drinks.

I ordered the Chicken fettuccine, and the creamy sauce wasn't what I expected. It was mixed with a bit of green in the sauce, and the fettuccine wasn't that great either.  There was minimal chicken in the pasta, I had to dig for it.

The appetizers were average.

Overall the experience here wasn't the best that night, probably due to understaffing issues, but I probably wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Solid American Kitchen, the drinks are OK but I think they go light on the alcohol in the mixers.
The service is good.
They have good variety of kids meals for $7.99 for drink , main with a side and desert."}
{"text":"I usually really enjoy my time at Kelsey's, especially on Thursday's because of the half priced wings, but tonight I was thoroughly disappointed. From the service to the food, everything disappointed. Our waitress seemed highly preoccupied as she had a big party in the other room. We sat down at 7:40 and had to wait about 10 minutes to see our waitress. We already knew what we wanted but our waitress seemed extremely impatient and barely smiled or made eye contact. She took our order and left. We saw her again about 5 min later with our drinks and then we did not see anyone again until 8:30 with our order of wings that were cold at that point. We asked for new wings and they came back 20 min later with the same wings just double fried and still at the same temperature. Our waitress never really checked back in with us and no manager ever came to the table even out of courtesy. At the end our waitress informed us that the manager took off 20% because the wings were not perfect but when I checked the 20% off was only applied on the wings and nothing else that we had which amounted to 6.59$. My dad proceeded to get the manager because he was so annoyed and only then did we get the help we needed. The manager handled it as well as possible and offered us some free dessert . Anyway needless to say , I won't be back anytime soon and I won't recommend Kelsey's anymore. They need to train their waitstaff and managers. This was by far a true waste of money. Only giving two stars because the manager really tried at the end."}
{"text":"Think the map is a little wrong on the yelp map view. It should be on the east of woodbine. Across from the FMP plaza where the chapters / home depot is.

Anyways. The appetizers are decent but the main is meh. Esp the burgers and sandwiches. I wouldn't trust the \"K\" recommended food. Had the BBQ chicken sandwich or something. Meh... ew not that good. I would rate it 0. Tastes worst than some fast food places in US.

Kind of sad that this franchise / location seems to provide crappy food. Moxies food is a lot better and of course cheesecake factory is a million times better. Seriously the food here needs to get revamped. They are doing something wrong.  

Surprised its still pretty busy but with all the selection around, I really would not pick this place for lunch / dinner. We only came here since we got gift cards from a friend.

Surprised that the best dish was the pasta."}
{"text":"Should of listened to the reviews. Arrived at 1220 for a quick lunch order received at 120. Server was friendly and competent but  restaurant appeared to be understaffed.
Bacon Mac and cheese was anything but cheesy and creamy, oily and dried out....
Second bad lunch experience at a Kelsey's 
Too many other choices available"}
{"text":"Good place to eat. friendly staff and good food. I tried their Phillie Sandwich and Man!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars ... Food wise, it's a 2 but since I came here with a stupidly big group, the service & kitchen exceeded my speed expectations so thats a 4.

It's hard to rate mainstream corporate restaurants as most are purposely not inventive and the quality is just average.  Kelsey's price point is very reasonable but in terms of quality food.  It is barely any better than your McDonalds.  It just happens to have a bigger menu... that's all.  I ordered a beet & goat cheese salad and it was just wilted... drippy & oversauced ... and really uninspiring.  Fries were hot but not crispy or salted.  It was a moment of 'I eat to live'.  

As for the atmosphere and service, I have to give credit to the staff here.  For a group of 30+ people, we ate in a really reasonable time.... if anything, all of us were expecting to be served nearly an hour later.  So the kitchen must have busted their butts getting everything done.  Mind you, none of the food was complicated (burgers, grilled chicken caesar, chicken fingers, poutine, looks like a McCain style pizza...).  The place was really clean and spacious.  The staff had all the bill splits done correctly and well organized.  I couldnt ask more from the staff.

Now, if only they could do fries right..."}
{"text":"This is a great to catch up iwth old friends. The two times that I've been here have not been that busy. Granted, this time there was a snow storm so not many people were out. That said, they have a full bar and a typical restaurant menu of burgers, fire meat, salads, spinach artichoke dip and wings. You get the idea. They don't have Rickard's White...I don't know if this is a common thing to not have it, but I was looking forward to it. 

Anyway, prices are pretty average not overly expensive, not very cheap. 

Also, it's in a plaza, so you can go do your shopping at Future Shop or Canadian Tire before or after you eat."}
{"text":"Overall we had a really good experience here.  The service was fast and friendly, the dining room was very clean and full of families enjoying dinner, and our food was very tasty.  

I can only comment on how good our food tasted but every dish that walked by our table, for other guests looked so yummy that I kept second guessing my order.  

The only thing I wish they had done differently was label the washrooms better.  They have a sign on the wall with an arrow that says, \"pool\"  it was a bit confusing as I walked into the kitchen instead and was then directed to the washrooms."}
{"text":"Went here this evening, restaurant was relatively empty with the exception of a party of about 12. Hostess sat us quickly at a booth and promptly disappeared. 3 servers walking around the dining room, giggling to each other. One server attending the party, while the other 2 simply walked into the back. The bartender waited in 2 or 3 tables. Nearly 10 mins waiting, the 3rd server went to the back as well.  
Another 5 mins past, now sitting for 15mins with no drink order or any sign of life I approached the bartender and asked if anyone was working. She brushed me off,
Rolled her eyes and with a wave of her hand said \"I'll be right there\". Needless to say, we walked out. 
We will never return to this Kelsey's location again, actually any Kelsey's for that matter.  I will also be telling any family and friends that are entertaining the idea of dining here to steer clear. Absolutely disgusted with the staff and their clear lack of regard for paying customers."}
{"text":"I went to this location night with my friend for my \"early\" birthday dinner.  I have order a meal \"Sizzling Fajitas\".  Taste great, good portion which is enough for me, and this location is very clean, feel so comfortable eating there."}
{"text":"I'm not big on chain restaurants so this is my first visit ever to Kelseys despite driving past so many before. 

I ordered the goat cheese and beet salad with chicken. Should have asked for the dressing on the side because the salad was soaked. It wasn't bad, just not my preference. It was a lot of salad and I couldn't finish it. Aside from the amount of dressing, overall it was delicious and had a nice blend of taste.

My sister got the lunch trio and for 10.99 it's a good deal. The soup however was a bit too creamy and thick. The sandwich was on cranberry rye and was delicious. The salad is nothing to rave about but they gave you dressing options which doesn't happen for most house salads. 

Service was top notch. Very friendly server. Our glasses were always full without having to ask for refills. 

Docked one star off because the silverware was dirty and that's a pet peeve of mine when there's fingerprints all over the utensils I'm about to put in my mouth. We just grabbed a new set off another table.

I don't normally eat out in Brampton but would definitely consider going back. Great place overall."}
{"text":"This is my first time here since their rebranding and I expected it to be far better than it actually was. We waited a while to be seated (no hostess around) and got sat in the bar area. Now normally I'm not too particular about where I sit but our server ended up being the bartender as well so she was pretty much MIA the whole evening. Our drinks came after our meal was served. My friend ordered the grilled cheese which was more onions and mushrooms than cheese. I got the chicken fried chicken which sounds more impressive than it looked and tasted. The fried cutlet was smothered in salty gravy and the steamed vegetables just looked old. Broccoli was almost yellow, definitely not fresh, surprised they still served it. Overall, the menu looked impressive but the food was lacklustre. Place was nice and spacious but it'll probably be a while before I return to a this chain."}
{"text":"We had a bit of a problem last night while dining at Kelsey's but Jason the manager quickly stepped into action and made sure we were happy.  Thanks Jason.....we will be back."}
{"text":"Came here for a council lunch and the food was okay, and the service was okay, but it took a long time for the server to give us our food."}
{"text":"Came in on Canada day at 630 pm. Sat on the bar side in a booth. Service is laid back but we were in no hurry so it was good. Had the full rack of ribs, it was bigger than most. The wife had the parm sand. Both were good and would recommend."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on a saturday.  There is a lunch menu to choose from, which is roughly around 9.99 per meal, and they advertise it will come in 15 minutes or free.  But when you look at the main menu, it actually isn't that much more expensive, but I'm sure you get a lot more food.  I ordered the wrap with side of sweet potato fries.  It was good, our food came out real quick - maybe 5 - 10 minutes after our order.  The service was good.  I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"l was their in November 2016 the  service was good and the place was clean. the fish and chips are amazing"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times in the last 6 months, and always order the Tuscan Salad which was amazing..the 1st time!

The 2nd time onward there has been something wrong / missing from the salad each time I order it. 
Burnt chicken, missing ingredients, no dressing (comes pre-dressed), wrong dressing. 

The last and final visit was a girls-night, our server was awkward and kept leaning into our faces to talk. Leaning into the table edge, pressing the front of his dirty jeans against the salt/pepper shakers, put his hand on the rim of our glasses, was slow and forgetful. 

At the end of the meal while trying to enjoy coffee's, a baby cockroach made his way up the WALL from the bankette seating in the main dining area... Right behind my daughters head!!

How many were festering under our seat?

Tried to advise a server / hostess / bartender as we left....no one was even on the floor. 

Needless to say, that was my/our last time there."}
{"text":"This place is always crowded with mostly mid 20's-early30's crowds. The food is average and you have lots to choose from. Great service with friendly and jovial staff. The only food I have enjoyed here is the curry shrimps and the funnel cake fries dessert. It was the first time I tried this dessert. It comes with strips of cinnamon sugar topped funnel cake and your choice of either chocolate or vanilla ice cream. They're pretty generous with the chocolate and caramel sauce on the vanilla ice cream too.
I would come back here for dessert and coffee, but not for main food."}
{"text":"This Kelsey's gets a lot of bad rap for one reason or another. I for one think it's a pretty reasonable option in certain circumstances. Circumstances that call for feeding a group with varying tastes and catching a pre-movie meal/drinks. 

The Good:
- Half-price wings on Thursdays (comes out to $10 for 20 wings)
- Accommodates kids and dieters (they have a nutrition guide online)
- Servers are quick
- You can buy your movie ticket from them for $8
- Food is consistent 

The Bad: 
- They have a bar, but I'm convinced that no one here knows how to poor a beer properly


Service: 7/10
Food: 6/10
Value: 6/10"}
{"text":"Kelsey's used to be the place I hang out twice a week for many years. However, the service now have turned abysmal. The same goes with the food quality. 

I guess after it was taken over by Cara's Foods group the quality just go downhill."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to a Kelsey's in a very long time. I admit, I was a bit skeptical when my friends wanted to grab a bite here after the movies. I recalled mediocre and unimaginative food from The Kelsey's of years past. Honestly, I was amazed by the restaurant makeover at the flag ship Etobicpke location! Cool decor, hip & happening place and an excellent patio. A great place across from the Cineplex to grab a bite after the movies. I quite enjoyed my mango mojito and Alfredo chicken pasta - it had great flavours! Our server was friendly and our food came out quickly."}
{"text":"Standard franchisee pub fare.  I don't mind this place.  The food is typical pub food and you can get a good burger or nachos.  It is great for groups of friends as you can reserve a big table.  The staff are friendly and will make recommendations.  I wouldn't go here for a date but I do like it for a group of friends."}
{"text":"Went here the other day. This is NOT a vegetarian / vegan-friendly place. The appetizers, in particular, the potato skins were not fresh, and were served cold. All of their food is fried in the same deep fryer, which is particularly frustrating were vegetarians. When the manager was informed of this, he simply laughed it off as not a big deal. 

Anyways, I've come here with my family a few times before desperately seeking vegan items on the menu, or, something on the menu that can be made vegan, and what comes out is always cold, not fresh, and results in many days of stomach pain!"}
{"text":"2.5 Star rounded up because of the $10 coupon in the mail

I don't have high expectation with Kelsey's, especially after reading all these Yelp's reviews.

With $10 off coupon in the mail, I decided to give this Kelsey's a try! The last time I was here was a long long long time ago...........The deco still the same? So it is kind of bringing back some memories...

We ordered The Messy Fish Sandwich ($12.99) and Seafood Lover's Pasta ($16.99) which the waitress was more than happy to substitute the pesto cream sauce to tomato sauce.

Food was quite standard. I doubt I would have pay full price for that as there are quite a lot of other choices at this price point!

Service though was so friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"The Food can be better I don't know if it was just the day I came, but yeah, the food took about 15 min to arrive. Our serving was huge but hey its Kelsey's."}
{"text":"I'm a massive fan of burgers. The craving hit one day and we decided to have dinner here and - surprise! - i got a burger. Or I guess what they were passing off as a burger. The patties were burnt, thin and almost half the size of the bun. I dont know what the cook was thinking letting that thing out of the kitchen. The 2 stars are for the delicious caesar salad and the friendly staff who attempted to amend the situation. I was honestly too worried to order anything else so they just didnt charge me for the burger."}
{"text":"Ive been to several Kelsey's locations and never had anything to complain about.  

Came here last night for dinner and ordered the gooey bacon mac & cheese $14.99.  What I ended up getting was a small bowl of old macaroni with dried up cheese.  

You know when you make KD and it's sat out for a few hours?  Just like that. 

There was absolutely no bacon on it. And it wasn't gooey

I was so surprised by the small size of the l bowl that I had to ask the server it it was mistakenly from the kids menu. He assured me it was not.  I showed him that there was no bacon in my dried up macaroni and he took it and brought me a new bowl 

The new bowl was delicious but still small. At least it was gooey and it had bacon.  

At least they did not charge me for the mac and mac cheese"}
{"text":"I was a regular customer at Kelsey's (once a week) and I went back there recently after not going there for a year and I was impressed with the creativity of the menu. Servers are amazing as always! Pro tip: the servers at the bar section are the cool people."}
{"text":"Nice bar, gorteous lady bartenders, alot of choices to eat or drink. Must see place when you are around"}
{"text":"The owner of this location is shady. Does things no other location does, like charging extra for extra wing sauce. 

Waiters are nor pleased to work for him as I've learned from conversations with them."}
{"text":"It was decent, not amazing but not awful either, just completely and totally middle of the road. Came for lunch on a weekday and it was pretty quiet, the waitress was friendly and the food came quickly. Portion sizes are generous but is balanced by the mediocre food. Our daughter enjoyed the colouring and the food so would return for her."}
{"text":"This was our first time at this location. We decided to eat a meal here, before going to the movies. We arrived around 3 pm (Saturday). The restaurant was dead. Very few tables filled. The bar was empty. 
The place looked great. Tastefully decorated and very clean. 
We were seated right away by our server, who handed us our menus and then left. Our drink orders were not taken for about 10 minutes. My boyfriend and I ordered bottles of MGD beer, which is a pretty common beer. The server left, 5 minutes later, came back and told us they did not have any MGD, and that we had to order something else. So we did. 
Another server brought our drinks to us. We asked to order, and she said our server would be right over.  At this point we had been seated for about 30 minutes, and time was ticking down before our movie started. We left ourselves 1.5 hours to eat, which we thought was going to be more than enough. Finally our server came back and we ordered our food. 
We ordered Bruschetta as an appetizer. Then I ordered a BBQ chicken Pizza. My boyfriend ordered \"The Big Moe\" which is a burger dressed similar to a big mac. And our friend ordered Breaded shrimp. Our food arrived within a reasonable amount of time. 
The Bruschetta was okay. The flatbread was a little over cooked. The pesto was a little over powering, but I do not really like pesto, so I may be biased. Everyone else liked it.
The chicken BBQ pizza was okay. The BBQ sauce was a little to spicy for my liking, but again, that was just personal preference. Again, everyone else seemed to like it. 
The breaded shrimp were really tasty. The seasoning in the breading was really nice. The shrimp were cooked well, and the chili sauce they gave with the shrimp was good. 
The fries that came with my boyfriends burger were good, salted and tasty. 
Now on to \"The Big Moe\" This burger was burnt to a crisp. The patties were black. He took a bite, immediately spit it out on his plate, and cussed for a few minutes. I can not believe that a burger this burn was allowed to leave the kitchen. 
Our server was no where to be found, but by the time he finally came back to check on us (5-10 minutes later), he looked at the burger and was shocked. He asked if we wanted another one made, but by that time we had no time to eat, so he just offered to remove it from the bill, which we agreed to. 
Sadly, all in all, we had a pretty bad experience. 
Bad food and mediocre service. For a chain style restaurant, I was expecting more. 
Unfortunately, I can not recommend this place, nor will I be visiting again."}
{"text":"I'll be honest and say that I come here for the Quesadillas, it is made perfectly every time I order it. It also comes with fries, salsa and sour cream. I recently tried the Funnel Cake Fries which was also made perfectly with ice cream and chocolate sauce on top. 

The service isn't too bad either, I've always been seated right away and the staff is attentive."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, but no. I don't know what it is but this is the second Kelsey's location I've been to that was such a disappointment.

To begin, as soon as we arrived, we had to find someone to assist us. Once we did, our waitress was kind, however the service sucked! It was so hard to find our waitress, place an order and ask for items (such as a straw, napkins, etc.)

The restaurant itself looked clean, so not complaining on that part. 

The food was good but I have definitely had better elsewhere. My favourite was the four cheese spinach dip. It was amazing! We also ordered the sweet and spicy Thai chilli wings. It was okay, not the best. 

I wanted a mojito and as they were having a mojito special I'm like why not? Boy did I ever regret that decision. I got a mojito with BROWN rum. I honestly was so sick of the place (I got my drink way after), I didn't want to complain to her. I should've though. The drink was so gross. If they didn't have the ingredients, they should have told me instead of handing me a nasty drink.

All in all, I wouldn't be back to this location. I would recommend getting take-out from there since the food isn't that bad (the four cheese spinach dip is heaven).

2 stars only because the restaurant was clean, our waiter was nice and the four cheese spinach dip was so good (yes I've been raving about it)."}
{"text":"After coming to this location numerous times, I'm still so disappointed that it's still the same and nothing has changed.

To begin, as my friends and I arrived, we got seated pretty quick because there were only about two other tables that were occupied. The waiter gave us a table right beside the bar. You would think the service would be really good considering the restaurant was no where close to being packed but boy, were we wrong. The service was not good! It's like he kept forgetting we were there or something (even though he was in the bar and we were right beside it), I actually started getting frustrated because I haven't dealt with such bad service in so long. On top of that, I do realize waiters make mistakes and that's totally cool if you're not being rude about it. Two of my friends decided to share two appetizers, the four cheese spinach dip and vegetable quesadilla. I wanted to try a new item on the menu (only available during chicken fest). I got the szechuan chicken bites. The waiter was taking our order and I guess he didn't hear me, he goes like \"WHAT?\" so rudely and in our face, I'm like okay then (he was talking really unprofessional). About 15 minutes later my friends received their appetizer but I didn't get my dish. We waited about 10 minutes (I munched on their four cheese spinach dip), and my dish still didn't come out. We called him over and he responded with \"I'm sorry but I forgot to punch it in.\" I literally waited an overall 40 minutes for one small dish that didn't even end up being something to die for. However, he did give us 3 a soft drink for free for waiting that long and for making the mistake. I did feel bad after he offered us a free drink, but the way he was talking and not checking up on us was just horrible.

The szechuan chicken bites were good, however they weren't amazing. It's a good dish to get if you aren't starving but want something to munch on. I personally thought it could've had more flavour but I still enjoyed it. The four cheese spinach dip was AMAZING! It was literally to die for. I didn't try the vegetable quesadilla, however my friends said it tasted good.

All in all, I wouldn't ever return to this location. Two stars only because the restaurant is clean, and the food was really good! I personally recommend the four cheese spinach dip! The service definitely needs to improve."}
{"text":"Went with a group for some  comfort food. We got the wings. Fish taco, rib and wing combo and batter fried fish.. our service was good.  The food was fresh and the ribs were  so   good and soft I did not need to use the knife provided. The wings could have been less saucy but we were having so much fun it didn't matter.  The fish taco was bursting with flavour .  I have been here  years ago  as well and my group got the wonton nachos which were a hit. I plan to be back for orders to go or to enjoy the food with friends."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend and we both had a great time. The waiter was friendly and gave his advice when ordering dessert.  We took his advice and was not disappointed,  we had the caramel lava cake and it was really good.  

We had ordered apps first though and got the brusscetta and potato wedges with chicken. The brusscetta was all cheesy goodness and I reallllly loved the potato wedges! (beware though, the wedges had a bit of a spice kick) 

Overall I had a great time. The atmosphere was great,  people were nice and the food good. I would come back again."}
{"text":"Great apps (amazing nachos). The main courses are missing something though."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say, but this one can't get more than 3 stars. I've been a few times, and I always leave disappointed, from the service to the quality of food."}
{"text":"I used to love Kelsey's and recently went to the one in Georgetown that wasn't bad but the Bolton location is terrible. The food always comes over cooked and the service is beyond terrible. We have been a few times hoping it would get better but we are constantly seeking out the servers. It took 20 minutes of us sitting at our seat waiting to get a menu before we walked out. Wings are dry, steak way over done. Wish they would improve, but don't recommend this location if you are looking for a good experience."}
{"text":"The food here is nothing to write home about.  Greasy, institutional, oversized portions, it actually tastes like you're at a TGIFriday's or something.  Our waitstaff person was a bit brash, swore at some other patrons and could be somewhat slow at times.  

Unfortunately it's one of the very few places to go to while waiting for a movie at the Queensway Theatre."}
{"text":"The Big What burger dissappeared, which made me sad. However, the grilled cheese sandwich was tasty mostly due to the bread they use (ACE bakery); the messy fish sandwich was a yummy break from meat. For $15 each, these two dishes were good. I suspect the portion control for their food is tightening and looks smaller but at least you can tackle hem without taking some home."}
{"text":"If I could give this zero stars I would - I went there I didn't even get to order before I took off pissed off. We were starving: last time we were here a few weeks ago the service was good the food was great and we were excited to go back. Tonight was different. There was Absolutely not one customer in the restaurant it is 10pm. We waited about 5minutes with no one coming to seat us before my boyfriend started looking around. A man with a name tag walked by with something in his hand in the bar area. My boyfriend went in and spoke to an \"off shift new employee\" who advised him he didn't know if they were still open. About 5 minutes later my boyfriend asked this employee if someone could come seat us. The Man with the name tag came back and my boyfriend asked what time they close and he said midnight. He looked like he had no interest in serving us so when my boyfriend asked me if I wanted to stay I said no let's go. If you have no customers maybe there's a reason like your attitude and lack of attention to your customers. Whoever was on staff tonight lost us as a return customer for sure."}
{"text":"In fairness, I am not a fan of roadhouse food or places in strip malls.  I've ended up here after seeing movies with friends as it is a convenient halfway spot.

They have updated their decor to seem more modern and urban chic  but I'm not sure it works.  The niche for Kelsey's was as a restaurant for families or work gatherings.  This feels like a family restaurant that wants the families to go away.  I'm not sure who that is supposed to appeal to.

The food is meh and way to pricey for the quality."}
{"text":"Go to this Kelsey's once in a while with my family. Service is hit or miss and so is food. Some dishes are good while others are bland/unimpressive and definitely not worth the price. The few dishes I would recommend are the four cheese spinach dip and feta bruschetta? flatbread. These two appetizers alone are what bring me back again and again."}
{"text":"Never going there EVER. Yes, the standars have dropped below ground level. I went there once YEARS ago and I remember it being a nice place to eat with good food. Went there recently, and regret it. My girlfriend and I ordered a drink special that was supposed to include two slushi like beverages and 2 appetizers. The beverages were supposed to have alcohol in them and didn't. The cesar salad was swimming in cesar dressing... SWIMMING!!! Last, but not least, the spinach dip was good but instead of dipping pita into the dip, they brought us deep fried triangular (i dont even know what to call it). We looked across the patio at another table who were having spinach dip and they had normal pita. 

Now about the service, I think there are TOO MANY PEOPLE working there because every single employee had lots of time to spare, just walking around and talking among eachother. MEANWHILE we had to wait for a very long time. The food took a while, and when we asked the server for our bill, he was walkign from table to table but not giving us our bill.  A lot of the kids working there looked like they were in high school. I think maybe Kelseys needs a new team to run the place."}
{"text":"Great service and great food quality. Our server was so funny and made our experience enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Love the new look after the renovations, especially in the summer since the restaurant opens up into the patio. Always pretty good food, I usually stick with the burgers and sandwiches here. Drinks and service has always been good in my experience as well."}
{"text":"Horrible. Be forewarned. 

As a regular at the other Markham Kelsey's, I came here expecting something similar to the great experience I encounter there every time I visit. Boy was I wrong. 

We were driving by and realized it was Thursday. That means half price wings! So we stopped. Big mistake. 

The wings were horrible. If you love deep fried batter and minuscule amounts of chicken .. Then you'll love these \"wings\". 

Significant other ordered a salad, came out dry. Literally no dressing. Waiter also told me that I needed a drink to get my half price wings. Mm weird , other location never asks me to buy a drink. 

Not to mention the fact that there was ONE PERSON working the whole bar area on a Thursday night. Half price wings, cheap drinks. One person. Working the bar. 

Never coming back here again LOL. What a fail."}
{"text":"The food here is really good. Price is reasonable. The new salads are fresh and flavourful. So are their flatbreads. 

Half price wings on Thursday are a steal as well. Friday's $5 Heineken!"}
{"text":"The worst service I've ever had in my entire life. Sat in the bar (with about 10 others) for 20 mins waiting for a server to come; they never did. Absolutely pathetic. How does this place make money? 

Never again. Save your time. Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Holy rebrand, Kelsman! 

Kelsey's looks more like some colourful, cheeky King West/Liberty Village pub than a Kelsey's, or any chain restaurant for that matter. Silly words in big lights against bright walls. You know the look. 

I had a bloody caesar which came with a spicy bean, the Bacon Bacon cobb salad, which was really more chicken chicken than bacon bacon, and their buffalo wontons with queso dip. The queso dip was my favourite part, because it's melted cheese. Duh. 

If you are in Etobicoke, and need to grab lunch and are in one of the chain-riddled parking lots, Kelsey's is an A-OK choice. 

PEPPER PROPS to Jess P. She's a great driver, and she was at the wheel on this Etobicoo-coo adventure."}
{"text":"Love the food and services its cery good quick and clean. The waiters are nice and are always timely when checking in with how you are doing. Theres never any rush and it is a comfortable relaxed environment to drink and eat in."}
{"text":"I went once in 2012 and another time in 2013 both for dinner. Very disappointed with the food both times so I haven't been back. Portions were ok, just the food quality was really lacking. The burger was such a complete disaster... I still remember how bad it was! I remember ordering a pasta with alfredo which tasted slightly better. For the prices, I expect better! The second star is for the service because I was lucky and had very friendly and attentive servers both times."}
{"text":"We came here before wonderland because the restaurant is located in an excellent location but we're sadly disappointed. 
The food was mediocre, but the customer service was awful! The place was not overly busy when we came in, but that didn't change the quality of service. After waiting 10 minutes for someone to come by our table and greet us, they quickly brought our drinks and took our order. Food came out pretty quickly but unfortunately no one came to check on us after. We had to flag someone down to get cutlery, and our waiter never came to ask how the food was. Needless to say I never even had my water refilled... Lastly, we waiting about 30 minutes for someone to bring us our bill and an additional 10 for the machine. 
Don't come here if you're short on time....you'll be late!"}
{"text":"If the service wasn't great here then I would've given Kelsey's a 2.5/5.

After reading a couple reviews for Kelsey's I recommended that my friend and I go for lunch here to try out their ribs and wings. It was around 12:30 when we arrived and there weren't many people inside. We sat in one of their booths which we both think are not designed properly because the seats are too low so the table feels high.

Since another Yelper said that they LOVE Kelsey's wings I decided to order some honey garlic ones. My friend got the half rib and wing dinner (for lunch). PS: It's $2 cheaper if you buy the dinner instead of the buying the half rib and wings on its own. The food took a while to arrive but since we were busy talking it didn't feel THAT long.  The food arrived warm and sort of appealing...nothing bad, yet nothing amazing. My friend commented on how the ribs weren't hot and how it wasn't the best. I thought the wings were alright, however the sauce was a bit plain. If I did want wings, I would go on a Thursday because they're half priced! 

Overall, Kelsey's is your typical American restaurant with many dishes that can be found at other restaurants."}
