{"text":"Great food and service! Authentic French food and atmosphere. Unbeatable value. Magnifique!!"}
{"text":"We just had a delightful dinner here. It's nice to see people who care and want you to have a wonderful meal. Our meal was prepared perfectly. And don't forget the desserts."}
{"text":"Beautiful authentic homemade French cuisine, you have to try this place, George the owner is very professional and he takes pride in his work as well he is fabulous wine connoisseur, reservation are recommended."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant. Any time my family members visit from Wisconsin this is where they always want to go. The food is awesome and the owners are kind and very charming. My brother-in-law, a former French teacher who has been to France many times, loves this place and enjoys speaking French with the owners. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"What a special treat. Get there! The ambience and food are worth the experience. Just another great Cleveland/Olmsted Falls dining treasure."}
{"text":"I think is the best restaurant in the area. If you want to have a good time and an awesome food, this is the place! Also, don't miss to have a conversation with Georges and Claudie ! Perfect !!"}
{"text":"The dining room is small but the flavor is large. The service was impeccable, very friendly and welcoming. The food is amazing and was paced well. In our company was person who grew up in France and declared this one of her favorite French restaurants in the US. Serving sizes were reasonable and the prices were also reasonable. Highly recommend for a slow evening of wonderful food and great conversation."}
{"text":"4th star is for service!  This place is the friendliest place I have eaten at in Cleveland!      George, the owner I think, was my server and went out of his way to make sure my solo dining experience was memorable. He even let me practice my horrible French with him but I digress... I started with the tomato tart with goat cheese which was magnifigue and so was the light salad that accompanied it. Why are the French so darn good with turning plain lettuce into something you want to eat ?  My salmon was cooked perfectly, was a huge portion, and topped with a creamy satisfying crab sauce. I also immensely enjoyed my peach clafoutis -so yummy and perfect custard like texture. With a great outdoor dining patio and a glass of wine, this is a great place to relax after a long day at work."}
{"text":"My go to restaurant! George and his staff have treated us like family from day one.  The food is superb.  The BEST french food in N.E. Ohio."}
{"text":"This place always exceeds my expectations. Most recently, my boyfriend and I were there for our anniversary. The chef they have back there is one hell of a cook - the escargot was incredible and my steak was cooked and seasoned perfectly. I also had this melon martini that was the perfect combination of sweetness and tartness. Our service is always excellent, so we just keep going back!"}
{"text":"This place strives but misses.  Our waitress was good, but the food...not so much.   The beets on the salad seemed like they'd come from a can.  My wife thought her rice tasted and felt like it came out of a box.  My steak was bland and the portion, for a steak entre, could not have been smaller.   The execution just doesn't match the price."}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous meal within a great atmosphere.  The starter salad was very fresh appetizer tasty the main course duck was the best I've ever enjoyed. Ended the meal with the Island desert light and just the right amount of sweetness.  The host give impeccable service."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I had a wonderful lunch here recently.  We had called ahead to make reservations, and we were seated promptly when we arrived.  Their lunch menu is a paired-down version of the dinner / evening menu, but plenty of excellent choices are available across all courses of a meal.  One of my colleagues and I decided to each get a different entree dish and share, so that we could try more menu options.  I started with their traditional French onion soup served in a beautiful white crock.  The broth was light (not overpowering) and the crock was filled with thinly cut onions, delicious bread and ample cheese.  For the two mains we shared, we ordered escargot and mussels.  The escargot were perfectly chewy served over puff pastry swimming in garlic butter and a small side salad.  The mussels were plentiful served in a bowl of a thin consistency white wine mushroom cream sauce and a side of crispy frites.  The frites were great for soaking up the \"gravy\" in the bottom of the mussel bowl and extra bread on the table was used to sop up all that fantastic garlic butter on the escargot platter.  After our meals, our two other coworkers each ordered a dessert...chocolate mousse and a creme brulee.  Although I did not try either dish, but guys had high praise for their chosen treat.  This is a lovely place for an \"upscale\" lunch or intimate dinner, will most certainly be back."}
{"text":"First time visiting this wonderful hidden gem.  Everything was wonderful.  The escargot was amazing in garlic butter sauce.  I had the surf and turf.  Everything cooked to perfection.  The service is the best I have ever experienced.  Valentine's celebration with my love to remember.  Thank you George and Claudia!!!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious and brings me back home! It's always a pleasure to go to the Bistro, the food is authentic, I know what I'm talking about cause I'm French. And as a bonus I can speak french with the owner... even met his wife who's from my hometown! Service is great, the waitress is very nice. My husband took me for my birthday, to make me feel less homesick, and it worked. We like to go on special occasions.  Place is wonderful, prices are very fair and the food, oh the food, you have to try it at least once. The menu as a little bit of everything. PS: les paupiettes de veaux sont delicieuses. Cela faisait des annees que je n'en avait pas mange d'aussi bonnes."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this charming restaurant more stars. I had looked forward to dining here since it moved to Olmsted Falls years ago. My overall experience was disappointing.   The service was IMPECCABLE. Our server was friendly, attentive, and didn't hesitate to get answers to our \"foodie\" questions regarding preparation and sourcing.  We started with cocktails, the peartini and the kir veuve de vernay. Both were delicious.  Then, the starter course: a tomato and goat cheese tart for my dining companion, and a mesclun salad with roasted tomatoes for me. The tart's crust was too thick. My salad was good but unremarkable.  For the main courses, we had a pork chop with apple stuffing and a steak with tomato butter. Both cuts of meat were overcooked, tough, and dry. The vegetable side of julienned carrots and squash was OK, just a tad overcooked as well. I am a little forgiving with the steak because it was clearly grass-fed beef; however, a skilled chef would know that these cuts of meat require different cooking methods, including marinating.   For dessert, we had the creme brulee and mousse au chocolat. Both were so-so. I prefer my mousse to be more light and airy, but this mousse is thick and heavy.   Because of the outstanding service and other good reviews, I will give this place a second chance. But I will order fish the next time!"}
{"text":"This restaurant upholds the reputation of French dining without a token side of French snobbery. It is run by an authentically French couple who take pride in the food they serve. They kindly humored my attempts at ordering in francais with a more-than-difficult-to-understand Yank accent.  The food is delicious. The atmosphere is intimate and cozy. The wine selection is superb.  However, in the European style, the service is hands-off. Expect to flag down your server if you have pressing needs. Make sure you have good company, and enjoy a long dinner.  Menu hint: I recommend the duck."}
{"text":"Totally in love with this place! We had a warm welcome, and easy to make reservations. Locally owned restaurants are a gem when you find a place like this. Very gluten free friendly. The food is high quality, and with service to match. I had the escargot, and rabbit for the first time and loved it. I recommend you stop by this charming delightful place. It was worth every penny."}
{"text":"Bistro Du Beaujolais, truly a hidden gem! The food, the staff, and the atmosphere incredible. My only wish would be it be more known. I had for starters a salad with Brie, main course the duck, and the desert a mousse. Every portion was delicious, and I particularly enjoyed the duck, cooked to perfection. George who I believe was the owner waited on us. His service went above and beyond and would highly recommend asking for him."}
{"text":"Fabulous French cuisine, and this from a guy who prefers wings and fries. Admittedly, my wife loves this place, but I always get a great meal, and excellent wine recommendations. Lunch or dinner is great. Owners are wonderful and treat you as valued guests.   Might be tough, but save room for the creme brûlée. It is homemade, and the best I've ever had, including a few experiences in Paris."}
{"text":"Outstanding! Fantastic service! Fantastic food! The owner was extremely pleasant and friendly. We loved the atmosphere.  We will be back again."}
{"text":"Almost everything our group ordered was disappointing. The seafood wasn't fresh and some selections were overcooked. The appetizers lacked flavor intensity. The bread, which in some ways is a test of a good bistro, was as hard as a rock. It was as though it was old and then over reheated.  With all the other fine French restaurants in the greater Cleveland area, we will not be going back here very soon. The service was also too challenging. The only good thing I can say about this place is that it's cute."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Reasonable prices. Attentive staff. Great atmosphere. My whole party loved it!"}
{"text":"My aunt died and we needed a place for the after funeral dinner. They were gracious and charming giving us a private room and service that couldn't be topped. My aunt would have loved the fact that we were all laughing and telling wonderful stories about her while eating some of the best french food I've eaten in a long time. Skip the onion soup and go for the soup of the day. The fish was perfectly delicate and the vegetables were superb. It was one of those meals where everyone shared and it was all marvelous. We managed to order the entire dessert menu then had to order several again they were so good. I would find the time if I were in Cleveland to search out this place. I will certainly be there again."}
{"text":"What a gem! Food was amazing and fresh, patio was wonderful and the best part is the hospitality. The host and server, Georges, was so much fun and welcoming. You truly feel like you have been transported to Paris."}
{"text":"One of my favorite meals. I had the 3 course menu with french onion soup, sauteed rabbit, and creme brulee. Everything was amazing. Can't say enough good things and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, the best French restaurant in Cleveland. After living in Clermont-Ferrand, France for half a year, I was missing the cuisine. After trying other similar restaurants in the immediate Cleveland area and only finding disappointment, I looked father.  What I found was a quaint little restaurant. No wonder it won Cleveland HotLists Best French restaurant several years in a row, because it also won my heart.   Not only was the food impeccable, maintaining French tradition and taste, but the service was second to none. My only regret is that few of the servers spoke French, but the owner came to visit at my table to be sure I got my fix of the language.   I highly recommend the Margret de Canard (duck) for anyone feeling adventurous and looking for a true taste of France."}
{"text":"Every ten or so years, I treat myself with a trip to Paris and wander the city streets.  After a week or so, the countryside beckons and I head out to the villages, find a little local restaurant in what was once a family home and become enveloped in true French hospitality and cuisine.  Or, I just go here.  Others have said it all, and very well.  The owner is a delight.  Flirts with my wife.  AND my mother-in-law.  (In a few years, probably my daughter, too.  They're all babes, so I'm used to it.)  Quirky, quaint, and quixotic.  Quiet, most nights.  If you haven't yet been, why?    \"But Paris was a very old city and we were young and nothing was simple there, not even poverty, nor sudden money, nor the moonlight, nor right and wrong nor the breathing of someone who lay beside you in the moonlight.\"   ? Ernest Hemingway"}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to visit. George always knows just the perfect wine to suggest, last night was 2001 chateau pavie....PERFECT!!! Our entrees were amazing & the suggested dessert paired perfect with the last sips of our wine!  Le Bistro is a must visit!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a cocktail since the kitchen was closing.... Very clean and well appointed!!!!! I will be back for dinner soon!!! Patio out front is a great place to watch peoples and such!!!"}
{"text":"Loved this place the moment George came to our table. What delicious food and George sang Happy Birthday to me in French! Can't wait to go back!! Great dining experience."}
{"text":"Traveling for business?? Go to France for the night! Seriously, you have got to try this place. I fell in love my first visit and am always glad when my travel brings me to Cleveland. Cannot possibly say enough good things about this experience. Love. Love. Love."}
{"text":"I've had two very nice dinners at this restaurant and would recommend it to anyone.  Owners are very personable and the food and wine are first rate.  It's like an evening in France without the horrible plane ride."}
{"text":"A REAL trip to Paris without leaving Cleveland.  This place is fantastic. More authentic than this just in France. George is a great server, very strong French accent but great on service too! Makes you feel like you are indeed in France.   Food is absolutely fantastic. I only had a Duck this good in Paris so you can't ask for more.  This restaurant is inexpensive for what you get. This is a must go in Cleveland."}
{"text":"One of the most delicious and best atmosphere restaurants in all of Cleveland area. If you haven't been here yet, you are missing out."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped in to have an appetizer and a glass of wine prior to going to our favorite Saturday night wine tasting at the Olde Wine Cellar.    Upon entering, the hostess greeted us and asked if we had a reservation.  After sharing our plan with her, she proceeded to share that they were down one person and could not serve us at the bar but could offer us a table.  We happily accepted the offer, however, as soon as George the owner came around the corner and the hostess asked if this was ok, he began to argue with her loudly in French.  No translator was needed - he was livid about us being there as walk - ins.    Mind you, it was 5:00 PM and only 5 tables taken.  Even if they were booked, his behavior was unbelievably rude and unprofessional.  People just a half hour before warned us of his conduct.  We were made to feel so uncomfortable just walked out. We will never even attempt to dine there again and will happily take our money elsewhere."}
{"text":"First time dining at a French restaurant for me, my wife had been to a few growing up.  Food was cooked to perfection and it was equally matched by the wine selections and the hosts.  I may have given a 5 star rating if I had something to compare it too.  Wife and I will surely go back in the future."}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic and the quality of service only augments the experience. It's fantastic and a total hidden gem for authentic (yet accessible) French food in Cleveland. Also it's a quick trip from the airport.   I need to keep this short for now, but just had to say something about this restaurant. I'll be back later to update it with details!"}
{"text":"After you've been coming to a wonderful place to eat for a few years, its so nice to have the owner greet you, kiss you hello and make you feel as welcome as the flowers in May. That is just the way we feel when we are greeted by Georges.  We have celebrated many a family occasions at the Bistro and have enjoyed every one. Tonight was no different.  A wonderful meal, wonderful wine and feeling like we are sitting at a bistro in France!  Thanks you George, for always making our family feel at home! Jeannie Wiggins"}
{"text":"If you want a five star French meal and don't want to drop $110/person this is your cat's meow. Fabulous French couple own and run the place. It's like eating in their kitchen but with five star service to match the beautifully presented entrees. They pay so much attention to the details and the servers can tell you all about them!  I had the duck, which did not disappoint and my hubby went with the frog legs.  Get out there and experience some world class cuisine a la French countryside"}
{"text":"J'aime le Bistro du Beaujolais !   I haven't had a chance to experience French cooking like this in years. Everything from the background music to the decanted wine had me swooning. Not to mention the fact that we got two four-course meals and a bottle of wine for $130. For the quality of this food, that's a great deal if you ask me.   This was an amazing Valentine's Day date for me. I would highly recommend visiting le Bistro du Beaujolais. You do need to have some time on your hands. Don't expect to get out of there in less than 2 hours. But, if you're anything like me, you won't want to leave."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! This place is terrific - delicious food, cute ambiance and a taste of Paris in your back yard. Some of my favorites include the quiche and croque Monsieur. Both are great and especially on the lunch menu where prices are cheaper. The prix fix menu is he way to go for dinner."}
{"text":"Le Bistro Du Beaujolais is absolutely one of the finest restaurants one can get a meal at in the Cleveland/Northeast Ohio area.  For Valentine's Day, I wanted to take my girlfriend to someplace special and romantic and, after much 'research', decided on this cozy gem in Olmsted Falls (and thankfully so).  Nestled in a cute shopping area devoid of any box stores or chain restaurants you'll find a welcoming building that looks more like a home than a restaurant, which is good thing.                  You are welcomed into the restaurant by the friendly and charming French owner and the atmosphere is warm and romantic; the dining areas broken up into rooms further cultivating the intimate feeling of the place.  The service is absolutely impeccable, there was not one moment we waited for our water or wine to be refilled, silverware after each course is removed with clean ones delivered on a platter, and the crumbs wiped away by the server as well. Classy.              Perhaps even more impressive was the food.  The menu changes seasonally at Le Bistro, as told by our server which adds to the fresh culinary experience. For starters we had the tarte l'oignion which was a deliciously creamy onion filling atop a delicately flaky crust. We both ordered the Roasted Duck reduced in a cherry port wine sauce which was most definitely some of the best duck either of us have ever.  I cannot even describe how well paired the cherries were with the duck, absolutely gourmet.  It was hard to top the main course but our homemade dessert, a vanilla peach cake, was the perfect end to our meal.        Again, this place is an absolute gem in the area and some of the finest French dining I've had.  If youre looking for a romantic, welcoming, and gourmet night out, certainly come to Le Bistro Du Beaujolais, we definitely will be again."}
{"text":"There aren't enough positive words in any dictionary to perfectly sum up this romantically-fantastic restaurant. I have been to Le Bistro twice--first time was Valentine's Day 2014 and second time was directly after my fiance proposed to me--and I cannot say enough about how much I love this place. From the food, atmosphere and most importantly, the incredibly friendly staff and owners, Le Bistro is THE perfect date night location. Both visits, our meals were superb. My fiance and I could not stop complimenting each dish as we ate them. We were also more than impressed, and could not get over how nice the owners and staff were. They even remembered us 7 months after our first visit! Now that's what I call going the extra mile.  If you're looking for a little taste of Paris for your next date night, please visit this establishment! You will not regret it I promise! I am already counting down the days until my next visit."}
{"text":"One of the most elite and authentic European restaurants in the Cleveland area. The pork tenderloin I had was filling and hardy despite the portion appearing small.   The owner has a temper at times and it can be uncomfortable to hear the arguing from your seat. I notice this happens when the restaurant is less crowded."}
{"text":"Not too bad. They have a good wine list and a pretty good dinner set that will leave you satisfied. They pride themselves of their creme brûlée but I think the caramelised sugar is a little too thick for my liking. Overall it's above average. I like how the restaurant is actually in a house so it absolutely cosy and warm. Good for groups :)"}
{"text":"The chef at le bistro accomplished amazing execution of 10 appetizers and ten entrees. Everybody in our party ordered a different item. The menu is huge and the kitchen staff very small. Nevertheless the food arrived in a timely fashion cooked perfectly. Kudos to her! Thanks for a lovely evening."}
{"text":"For authentic French cuisine Bistro du Beaujolais is the place to go in Olmsted Falls. The food is very delicious.  I can say that I never had a meal there I did not like."}
{"text":"I was directed here by some recommendations on a Facebook group that I'm a part of. The reviews were so positive I just had to come and check it out for myself. I called Thursday afternoon for a reservation that evening as suggested by the website. I got right in and arrived right when they opened for dinner at 5pm. The restaurant itself was an adorable little house set back from Columbia Rd. I could hardly believe that it was a restaurant at first!   I was greeted by a lovely French gentleman, the owner (George) as I later learned, and was seated in the dining room all by myself. George was wonderfully helpful with the menu and drinks, recommending wines to go with each dish. Throughout my meal he made sure that everything was to my liking and, as I was alone, took the time to chat with me about food, France, travel, and the restaurant business. I felt incredibly welcomed and was thrilled to have such a kind and knowledgeable person to talk to while I ate.  As for my meal, I started with the soup of the day- mushroom and cream soup with herb oil. It was more of a mushroom puree because there was very little cream taste and the mushrooms were certainly the star of the soup. Very delicious!  My second course was the escargot with a little salad. The escargot was presented very different than I'm used to! It was served in little puff pastry triangles! I must say, it was DELICIOUS! Far better than I'd even had in France. The escargot were very tender, the portion was generous, and the taste was well balanced. The flakiness of the pastry really added a nice textural difference to the soft escargot, not to mention the pastry were flaky, buttery, and delicious on their own!  My next course was the signature dish of the restaurant- the skate wing. I was skeptical because skate is a VERY tough fish to both cook and get fresh. There's a LOT that can go wrong!! Again, the skate had been recommended so I wanted to try it. I was definitely NOT disappointed! The fish was tender, juicy, and so fresh! The taste of the fish itself is like scallop meets shrimp meets halibut. It's mild but sweet and very meaty. The sauce base was horseradish and mustard but wasn't overpowering at all (like one would think of horseradish). It was served with rice and perfectly julienned veggies.   My next course was the cheese plate. Four very different French cheeses with varying intensities. All very delicious!  My final course was peach clafoutis. I love fruity desserts and this one was a pleasure. It was not overly sweet, which is what I prefer, and was a very delicate finale!  The wines were all French in origin and the two I had paired perfectly with my meal and were recommended by George himself.   All in all an extremely pleasant meal with wonderful company. I will return to this restaurant over and over and will happily recommend it to anyone looking for a great place to eat!"}
{"text":"\"Excusez-moi...s'il vous plait?   Before we order, could we have more of this incredible bread?  Two or three loaves would be nice.  And about 4 dozen pats of that butter, too?. . . Merci.\"   The Bistro's delectable, fragrant, full-of-air-pockets, chewy-tender French bread (served with a sinfully addictive high-quality butter), their simple mesclun salad with French vinaigrette and two sweet/slightly tart beet slices (similar to candied Harvard) served with our luncheon choices, were all especially delicious, but their pureed BUTTERNUT SQUASH SOUP?   C'est magnifique!   A Must Do for a smallish size bowl, and only $2.50 with all luncheon sandwich, quiche, and entree orders.  The soup du jour will probably change, but order a bowl of WHATEVER it is.   A great value, and the perfect opportunity to taste an extra Bistro offering.  (Haven't tried it yet, but their French Onion is served daily.)  It had been years since we had frog legs or Quiche Lorraine---so those were our choices.  The legs were slightly strong-tasting (likely a rare occurrence, and beyond the Bistro's control) and the sauce (butter, garlic, parsley, and wine) was a touch too garlicky.  (And I love garlic.)   But may try again on another visit.  The unusual quiche, with an excellent, surprisingly thin but flaky crust, and small cubes of roasted bacon fat throughout---intentionally not fully rendered down, like pork belly---was very good, but far richer than expected.   Even though I was hungry, I could eat only half of the slice.  (A small tart on a little mound of mesclun, however, would be a perfect appetizer or amuse bouche.)   For me, too much of a good thing, but if you love quiche---by all means---order it.   It might become your favorite.  And if too decadent for you, too?   Share it.  I'm sure that others at your table would love to sample its unique savory richness.    For the finale we had the peach clafoutis (good) and the chocolate mousse (very good).  La mousse won the Grand Prix Dessert---a 6-7 ounce coffee-cup size, topped with a generous swirl of whipped cream and a vanilla wafer.  With all luncheon prices being surprisingly reasonable, the diminutive Du Beaujolais---but with an uncrowded, spacious seating for around 50---could VERY easily become habit-forming.   Even though this charming, white-table-clothed bistro has that definitive air of refinement, it's totally unpretentious---from friendly, efficient server Bailey, to jocular, down-to-earth owner, Georges, who had just finished a jog and was sitting at the bar in his running shorts and shoes, eating something fabulous, I'm sure.   Of course, that doesn't mean diners are given carte blanche to come in yoga or exercise attire.  Casual duds are an unquestioned privilege reserved exclusively for owners of any establishment, so forget about wearing anything with Adidas, New Balance or Nike labels.  On the other hand, Louboutin, Dior, Gaultier or Chanel are totally acceptable---but also totally unnecessary.   In-between is just right.      No surprise---lots of favorable reviews.  May try the frog legs again next time---or their stewed chicken---or escargot in puff pastry---or who knows what?  We may just stuff ourselves on their perfectly irresistible bread, butter, soup, and salad.   Haven't decided yet, since everything on their menu sounds so wonderful--- especially in French.  They don't offer it, but even a fried bologna sandwich with potato chips would sound divine.  And if they DID?   It probably WOULD be divine.  (Not to worry.  English translations printed on menus.)        ~~~ Choo-Choo warning.     Allow an extra 10-15 minutes to avoid a possible delay in arriving here on time--- especially if it's nearing closing hours.  If coming from the north, heading south on Columbia Road, there are train tracks nearby that you'll have to cross.  From it's location, the Bistro is probably part of the retail-bar-restaurant-antique Grand Pacific Junction.    Our first visit 6 weeks ago was, unfortunately, sans food, since we arrived at the stroke of 2:01, and the kitchen had just begun closing for lunch---after we were literally parked on Columbia in the southbound lane for almost 7 minutes.   Georges apologized profusely, then immediately took us by the scruffs of our necks, escorted us back toward the entrance, and threw us out the door onto the cold cobblestones.  Those ever-playful, fun-loving French.  (Shamelessly exaggerating.)  Dusting ourselves off---and not the least affronted since I've been known to run my kitchen at home in much the same way, at times---we knew we HAD to return because of the mouth-watering aromas inside.    Our second visit---WITH food---confirmed the offerings here truly DID taste as good as they smelled.  Enjoy.  Then you can change into your Nike's for an after-luncheon hour or two of Grand Pacific shopping and sightseeing.  While you're at it, maybe a bit of brisk walking, too, to help burn off some of those marvelous Du Beaujolais calories."}
{"text":"Amazing. My boyfriend arranged a dinner here with some of his coworkers when I came to visit him from California back in August. I think his coworkers come here often, and he wanted to show this place off to me. My boyfriend really wanted something special, so he called a week in advance to request foie gras specials since I couldn't have it in California. He told me prior to my arrival that he had been coordinating with the chef to plan this dinner. I believe the husband of the chef and part owner of the restaurant served us. He was great, very charming. To start, we shared foie gras on toasted bread and mixed greens. The bread was toasted perfectly and the salad balanced the richness of the foie gras greatly.  The foie gras was deliciously creamy.  I got the scallops and shrimp entree and my boyfriend got seared foie gras entree. I didn't want foie gras overload, but still wanted to try the entree, so we shared our dishes. Great scallops and shrimp! Scallops were firm but not chewy. I know scallops can be tricky to cook, and the chef did a great job. I also loved the curry sauce they were in. The seared foie gras was pure yum! But we all know how fatty it is, and thank goodness it came with a side of steamed vegetables. I can't remember what I had for dessert, but I'm sure it was delicious as well. The chef, Claudie, came out to greet our table after our meal was over. She's so cute and tiny, and very sweet. This was a great, decadent  meal. It is pricier than your average dinner, but I would say it's worth it, especially when I compare it to something similar that I could have in LA. And how adorable is it that the restaurant is in a little house? Love it. Can't wait to come back on my next visit to Ohio."}
