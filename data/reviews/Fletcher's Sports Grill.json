{"text":"The Fletcher's Burger was pretty fantastic, the fried zucchini and the sweet potatoe fries were wonderful.  The Philly cheese steak with mushrooms was cheesy and delicious.  The sourdough bread on The Club sandwich was terrific, thick sliced and tasty.  The fish and chips were very good!  The service was outstanding!"}
{"text":"Walked in, no one to greet you, waitress gave some drinks and menus to a table close to the door, looked at us and said nothing. There is no hostess stand or anything. Couple tables pulled close to face tv where people were watching the game. Mostly people drinking and not eating. Smelled strongly of beer. We walked out after standing awkwardly in the door for a few minutes with absolutely no one talking to us."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for lunch (had a coupon) and were pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food. Had been here previously when it was Heights sports grill and would never go back, but we saw they had new ownership so decided to give them a try. The totnachos were excellent and the sandwiches were as good as any we have had at other sports bars. However there are not enough televisions compared to other sports bar in the area, and the service left a little to be desired since our waitress was also the bartender and we were located on the other side of the room. She did her best but I think she was overwhelmed, maybe this will improve as they get better organized! Definetly will go back to give another try, even if is just for the totsnachos"}
{"text":"What a great sports bar and grill.
The staff and patrons are extremely friendly and make you feel very comfortable.
The food is some of the best around.
You gotta try the Cajon chicken pasta."}
{"text":"Stopped in today to check out Fletcher's as I had come here when it was \"The Heights\" and was never too impressed with it then. They have brightened the place up and it is very nice inside. Sat at the bar and was promptly waited on by the bartender. She brought me my drink and brought me a menu. Told me that they had 1/2 price burgers today seeing as it was \"National Cheeseburger Day\"  also that they made the best burgers. Seems like I had been told that by a lot of other places. So I ordered a cheeseburger. 
Well I have to say I was pleasantly surprised that she wasn't just telling me a story. Had to have been one of the tastiest cheeseburgers I have ever had. Now I like a regular burger. Not one of those blue cheese magic relish type of burgers. Just a regular burger with the standard fixings on it. This was a great burger - Nice thick juicy patty (NOT GREASY), bun toasted, leaf of lettuce, couple of slices of tomato, slices of red onion with a good amount of real cheese on it. Only thing missing was the pickles, but it didn't matter because WOW what a burger!
Side was their coleslaw which was a generous amount and tasty as well. Not too sweet and not soupy. Crisp. 
I will be back."}
{"text":"Through Door Dash, I ordered the Philly Cheesesteak and a French Dip from Fletcher's Sports Grill.  The food arrived in time and the Philly Cheesesteak was the best I've had in Phoenix, my wife like the French Dip too."}
{"text":"We finally decided to visit and are we ever glad we did!  This hidden little gem was clean, the staff was friendly and they have a fantastic happy hour including craft beer! All day on Sundays too!  We ordered the pretzels with cheese, loaded potato skins and Cajun chicken pasta. They did not disappoint. Give them a try, I think you'll be happy too."}
{"text":"Four stars is for the food and the wait staff.  The initial impression when you first walk in is dive bar. It's very basic in the design and not very welcoming. As mentioned in other reviews, no one greets you at the door and it is hard to discern between who works there and customers.  We sat at a corner table that needed wiped down.  The server was very attentive and took the order by memory and remembered every detail.  The food was plated professionally and looked very good.  I had the BBQ burger medium, it was cooked perfectly, the onion rings were also excellent. Everyone in my party was very happy with their food.  I will definitely go back but wish they would put a little more effort into the design of the interior to make it more inviting instead of the cafeteria set up.  At minimum put a seat yourself sign in the front so you know what to do when you walk in.   Probably should also keep people from smoking right outside the front door."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times since it changed names from Heights to Fletchers.  We went on Friday to get the all you can eat fish and chips.   It was fairly busy and took a little bit of time to place our order, not too long.  The food took awhile and when they brought it to the table it was cold, really just room temperature.  The pieces of fish were rather small but it was all you could eat.  After about 10 minutes I ordered more fish and it took about 15 minutes to get it.  I was really surprised that they brought two tiny pieces of fish that was literally about 1/16th of an inch thick and 1x2 inches wide and long.  I just laughed.  The waitress did not understand what the issue was (even after I told her the fries and fish were cold and the next batch was the size of a sample at Costco).  She did tell me the next order to go out was even smaller and the manager had to tell her not to deliver it.  We were very disappointed and left."}
{"text":"Hands down best local sports Grill I have ever been too! Staff is friendly and engaging while the kitchen is putting out amazing food! I highly recommend the carne asada tacos and if you come in on Tuesday they run a special on them."}
{"text":"Fletcher's Bar and Grill has amazing food and the staff is friendly and helpful ! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Fletcher's Sports Grill is a new sports bar in Peoria. We were staying in the area and it was one of the few spots open late night so we stopped by for a late dinner. The interior has your typical sports bar look but we ended up sitting on their patio which is pretty spacious. After grabbing some brews and checking out the menu, we found out that they had an all-you-can-eat appetizer buffet. We decided to go that route. 

The buffet didn't offer as much variety as a Chinese buffet, for example, but still a good amount of options. Chicken tenders, potato skins, onion rings, mini corn dogs, and a few additional options. Your typical bar fare. Not incredible, not bad, what you would expect from a sports bar. Service was solid."}
{"text":"Use to go all the time when it was The Heights and loved it, so stopped by the other day. Came in around noon, 2 people at the bar so I bellied up. tall, young dark long hair girl soberly walked over to me ask what I wanted to drink, and left a menu...I said I will have a bud light draft. She brought it, too much time passed and I called out to her I'd like to order, she came over I ordered a burger, not to long and it arrived. Burger was OK, never again did she say a word to me talked to some one at the bar that she appeared to know. Time passed and I requested my bill, paid and left.. If.....you want your bar to succeed, get a bartender that has some life in her, this chick was dead, did not belong in that position!! Just saying."}
{"text":"This is just a ok place to catch a beer and burger. When entering the restaurant, no hostess available to seat you. You don't know who works there, since the workers were nothing showing they are employed at Fletcher's. Happy hour prices are good !! Burgers are very tasty!!"}
{"text":"Came here today for the all you can eat fish fry and it was excellent. My wife had the club sandwich and she loved it. Atmosphere is very good they have tons of tvs for sports and play a variety of good music."}
{"text":"Very similar to Heights the last sports bar at this location. They remodeled the inside with wood floor and made it more family friendly! Very nice staff, great specials and their Micheleda is amazing!"}
{"text":"So I never leave reviews whether I love or hate a place, but I could not leave this experience unmentioned. My wife and I regularly go to fletchers. We have met the owner, love their food, and appreciate their affordable prices. But when we tell our friends how excited we are to go to a place for one last drink on my BIRTHDAY while they are still open and get greeted by an employee who says, \"We're closed. We already made last call\" and proceeds to pull a chair in front of me to block my entrance and slam the door in my face, I can't keep my mouth closed. If you are open till 10, be open till 10. This is unacceptable by ANY business that wants to survive. I always wondered why this place had such bad reviews on yelp. Now I know. Why would I ever want to come back here after being treated that way? I wouldn't. You just lost my business."}
{"text":"Fletcher's is a great neighborhood Sports Grill. They have good food, friendly service, cold beer and plenty of TVs to watch your favorite sports game."}
