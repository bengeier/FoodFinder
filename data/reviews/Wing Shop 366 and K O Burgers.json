{"text":"Despite being incredibly familiar with the area, I'd never been here until I reconnected with a friend who worked there and we visited her while she worked. The Friday deal (there's probably one for every day, but I don't know them!)  of buy one burger, get the next for a dollar is always welcome when you've been drinking. And the burgers themselves are moist, freshly made, and delicious. They have cooked onions as a topping, not just raw! And the guy working heated them up for me before putting them on my burger!  Absolutely a better bet than Hero Burger.   Though to be honest, I did not even realize they served wings, or that it was part of their name..."}
{"text":"Wish I had the reviews here first!  I had the Hugo burger and fries. I had no trouble with the speed of service, but that poor girl clearly would rather be doing anything else than serving customers.  My burger was OK - it was a bit greasy and rubbery, but pretty filling for the price. The fries were awful - soggy and greasy, and even though the signs clearly state they cook everything to order, arrived cold.  Won't go back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite while walking through the annex.   Food was pretty poor quality and the place was filled with smoke.  Fries were undercooked and slimy, and the burgers were low quality grocery store style burgers.  This is one of the only places I have stressed to my friends not to go to."}
{"text":"Super slow service. Waited for more than 30 minutes for my burger. Fries are always cold. And the pops are expensive."}
{"text":"i used to work here actually and i still would eat the burgers, theyre different than any other burger i had, to the person who said they werent seasoned^ is an idiot in my opinion the food is greasy b/c its FAST food people, the onion rings/fries are DEEP FRIED!  what do you expect lmao..  i dont go here often because i live pretty far form the area and im not there often but i crave their food sometimes... the burgers taste really unique to me."}
{"text":"It's acceptable. I went there before noon, so I didn't experience lines or anything. It certainly took some time to have my order ready (like 25min) and the fries were overcooked. The burger was good (nothing special). The place doesn't look good, though - they should work on the decoration. It's not very well-lit and looks a bit dirty. It's a shame, because the attendant was pretty polite and in good spirits.  I can see being an inconsistent experience, though, depending on size of lines and time of the day. Doesn't have lots of tables for large groups, too."}
{"text":"I just had a really terrible experience with K O Burger.  Our food took 3 hours to be delivered, with an interval in the middle where the dude at the store cancelled the order without telling us. They got the wings order wrong and it looks like they left my sad little chicken burger under a heat lamp for at least two of the three hours.  I can't imagine I'll ever order from K O again."}
{"text":"Late night burgers on Bloor W; grab Double Hugo with nearly an infinite variety of wing sauces to put on top.  The wing sauces aren't enough weight to have much of an impact on the meat; the sauce gets K.O.'ed in comparison but it's nice to have a touch of Tandoori for example.  Some chillin' couches in the front window area."}
{"text":"INCREDIBLY slow delivery service. Spent hours waiting for food to arrive."}
{"text":"KO Burgers is a half decent place with pretty good pricing, but nothing about it will blow you away.  The service at this place was around average, although the actual look of the restaurant itself is kind of sketchy and run down, although not to the point where you'd never want to come back again.  I ordered the 9oz Hugo burger with a side of fries and a can of coke.  This only totaled to about $9.50 so the prices are quite good.  The burger itself was better than most fast food places but still not really all that amazing.  It was a good size though and was filling, especially for the price.  The fries were pretty bad, they didnt have any flavor and some of them got stuck together so the middle part in between them was uncooked and gross.  If it wasn't for the fact that the burger was half decent and the price was acceptable this place would be a 1 star out of 5.  Go only if you're in the area and need a quick meal to eat."}
{"text":"Biggest pile of shit I've ever seen. Ordered online through Just-Eat.ca. Food was late, cold, and they forgot my drink. But to top it all off, the burgers we got had NOTHING ON THEM. What the fuck is this shit, look at it: http://i.imgur.com/Ewf2Jeg.jpg  Edit: I highly recommend Just-Eat. I filed a complaint with the restaurant when I posted this review. The guy who answered said the manager was out and that he would contact Just-Eat for a refund. I doubted him and contacted them myself. Excellent customer service got me a refund and a $5 coupon for the hassle."}
{"text":"I went to this place under the impression that it was, and I quote, \"The best burger place is Toronto, and my favorite place to eat in Toronto.\" That was said by my good friend from Nova Scotia who has only lived here for the last 2 months.   Unfortunately, I would have to completely disagree with his assessment. The service was poor and slow, the meat was unseasoned and tasted like foam, the bun tasted stale, and the sauces that my friend raved about (over 60), are so watery that they immediately fall off the burger onto the paper.   The fries were nothing special, but they did have a unique flavor, one that I would consider going back for.  My friend is still adamant that this place is amazing. I guess it floats some people's boats, but not mine. Poor show Nate, poor show."}
{"text":"I rarely say it, but this place TRULY is totally ghetto. Only eat here if you are desperate.   The food is cheap and completely nasty. I sat with my two friends (visiting from Sarnia, extremely broke and wanted cheap food) as they devoured countless kitchen nightmares - grossly overcooked burger, burnt wings and the most greasy onion rings I've ever seen.   It also took an obscenely long time for the food to come out and it all came out at different times.  There is absolutely no decor to speak of, there are random furniture bits like couches and armchairs that look like they came from Salvation Army.  Seriously - there are countless cheap options in the Annex and there is no reason to consider eating here."}
{"text":"The most generous word I can use to describe this burger as is \"unique\". The patty was charred and tasted like a hot dog for some reason. The texture was also rubbery like a hot dog as opposed to being tender. I've had tastier veggie patties than this. I was deeply disappointed with the burger after waiting so long for it (almost half an hour!). It was totally not worth the calories and the money."}
