{"text":"Food is not the best we've had; the place has little ambiance and the fridge humming is way too loud.... Too pricy for quantity."}
{"text":"Cuisine savoureuse, intime. Il faut s'attendre à commander en anglais, mais le personnel est très gentil et accueillant. On s'y sent bien accueilli. Le poulet au beurre est un classique, les plats végétariens ne nous ont jamais déçus. On aime beaucoup!"}
{"text":"Charges too much for such small servings! The Biryani tastes like pure chilli powder. Butter chicken is all sauce barely any meat. They can't even get the naan right. Too bad it's the only Indian restaurant in Vaudreuil."}
{"text":"Très bon goût!

Présentation  simple, décor ok, saveurs délicieuses!

Une belle trouvaille en dehors de Montréal!"}
{"text":"Excellent food with complex flavours.  The Chana Samosa is extremely good, delicious onion bhaji, great korma sauce... basically everything is delicious.  Very friendly service, and bring your own wine makes for an economical dinner.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Fast friendly service! Food is always delicious, hot and tasty. Many choices for curry, vegetarian or meat dishes. Quick dinner after work. They also do take out if you want to eat at home."}
{"text":"Very reasonably priced, lunch special everyday. I eat here twice per week since it is so close to my office. Very friendly staff. Try the palak paneer, or the lamb madrasi both favourites of mine."}
{"text":"Very small BYOW dive, with very good Indian food. Try the channa samosa if you enjoy a little spice - you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty great for Indian take-out! Don't expect a miracle, this is just good food that's filling and available for take-out at a decent price.

I typically have the Palak Paneer and often find myself with a craving to go back to get more."}
