{"text":"After reading good reviews of this place I went to check it out. I thought the atmosphere was terrific, it actually looked much better than I thought it would. The interior looked a lot bigger than expected (since the outside looks tiny). The service was excellent even on a very busy night. The lady that I assumed was the owner made us feel very welcome. Glasses were topped up, asked us how the meal was, food came out pretty fast. The food though was just okay though, nothing special. There is limited selection since you only get to choose main and everything else is the same (garlic bread, clam, salad, dessert, coffee). But it is rather good value for what you spend since you get everything for around $25ish. I just wished there was more selection in terms of appetizers and desserts because if I go back, I will be tasting 80% of the same dishes. Atmosphere 5/5 Service 5/5 Food 3/5 Overall 4/5"}
{"text":"PLEASE READ.....  I have been a regular here for 6 years now. Most unassuming restuarant in the southside of scarborough. You would walk right past it, but once you do walk in you will be greeted by a dark panel and dim lights and a very elegant decor. Great for a first date. My wife and I come here about twice a year just to enjoy the food.   Best veal East of Yonge street. Yep thats right I said it and I stand by it.   Orange roughy is baked to perfection and seasoned so nicely. Flaky and lovely.   All meals come with a complimentary app which is a baked clam right in the shell with cheese and some sort of potatoe stuffing. SO FREAKING GOOD!   The ambience, food and friendly staff and not to mention the great prices ( $25 gets you the app, main and a dessert ) make this an awesome hidden gem in scarborough."}
{"text":"The place is dated as far as decor is concerned, the owners operators are Greek (I think) so it comes out in the Italian food. Service was adequate, food is plentiful.  Ok family restaurant"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went. We had the veal cordon bleu and pepper steak for the entrees which also included a salad, appetizer, garlic bread, dessert and coffee or tea. We each had a 4-course meal for under $30 a piece. The food was incredible especially the steak which was perfectly cooked. The only complaint was some burnt edges on the garlic bread but overall we highly recommend this family run italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Nice quiet place good value for your money, John is a magician with food and his wife Helena is warm and inviting as well as their daughter is truly a family run restaurant. Have been going there for the past two years when ever possible and is always my first suggestion and the veal villroy  the special is the best. Always afraid to try another dish only to say later should have had the villroy. It would your loss if you do not try this little piece of heaven"}
