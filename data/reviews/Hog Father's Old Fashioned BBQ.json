{"text":"Loved the pulled pork, mac and cheese and onion straws. Nothing fancy, but quality and flavors excellent for the price. Service well above average."}
{"text":"Hog fathers is a great place to grab lunch or dinner. I work in nearby Southpointe and regularly take guests here for lunch. The food is great whether your getting a pulled pork sandwhich or baby back ribs. If your looking for a good appetizer, the pulled pork nachos are awesome. There is not a whole lot of seating and it does get crowded around lunch time. If you can, try and go a little early or around 1:00 to miss the crowds. There usually isn't much of of a problem getting a seat on weekends and for dinner."}
{"text":"The website hours stated that they were open until 11pm,and we got there at 9:50pm. The young man at the counter said we could still order. The young girl working the kitchen was busy saying it was too late while sucking on her lollipop. The man working the kitchen said everything was shut down already. In a real business, you wait until last minute to shut everything down for customers. Sure you get your side work done. Open until 11 doesn't mean you leave at 11. If one of them was the manager, he should have a talk with himself. Lazy people."}
{"text":"Food is good, fresh, fairly good sized. Tastes like actual homemade BBQ.  Service is usually good, a lack of management shows up when the \"take out service girl\" doesn't know much about the menu. I had to ask multiple questions about items which she couldn't answer. Overall good food."}
{"text":"Ribs were yummy. Love the bbq sauce it came with. Kids and I enjoyed many of the sides as well. Will return"}
{"text":"Food is okay sometimes and very bad other times. Makes me sick quite often. Servers are friendly but could be better attending to their customers. In the summer there are consistently tons of flys, flying around the restaurant which make me want to vomit. I have no desire to go here ever again."}
{"text":"This place has really good food. Hadn't tried it till someone brought me a pulled pork sammich...on a potato roll...mmmm....bangin'.....definitely shoulda had this soooooner......however, after multiple experiences I'd say the staff there leave ALOT to be desired...."}
{"text":"Although the staff was nice, they didn't seem to know all that was going on. I asked for an IPA and was brought a porter, and was told, \"They told me it was an IPA,\" by my server. Lucky for them I like porters as well, but it definitely wasn't a fluke.  I went ahead and ordered the half chicken dinner.  After my food arrived, my mashed potatoes were cold and the chicken didn't look out of this world good. When I first cut into it, I could tell it was a little dry, and when I actually ate it, it was severely lacking in flavor. I couldn't believe that a barbecue place would be so bland but it was true.   The only positive things I have to say about my visit was that my baked beans were pretty decent and the staff really seemed nice.   Maybe they just need to re-evaluate their cooks or something."}
{"text":"Came by for a quick lunch and overall was satisfied. I was greeted as soon as I came in and was seated immediately. I ordered their fried chicken salad with honey mustard dressing. Cooking time was reasonable at about 10 minutes or so. Chicken breast was wonderfully fried and juicy on the inside. Salad had fresh green and red peppers along with bacon, tomatoes, and a medley of greens (mostly iceberg but whatever). I am a picky honey mustard fan because most restaurants' have terrible honey mustard. Theirs seemed homemade and it was just right. Service was friendly and prompt. Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Welp it has finally happened with Hogfathers ...it is now on my don't bother to go there anymore list. Wife and I went there last Saturday and needless to say all of the food was subpar. The Chili-cheese fries were just swimming in whatever liquid cheese they use, My wifes mac and cheese was so salty it was like they accidentally tried to shake salt on it and the shaker top came off. My fried chicken was past fried and well on its way to dead as were my fries. About halfway through my meal I got the feeling of being ill and had to stop eating, even the old standard cornbread that USED to be excellent is now horrible ..such a shame"}
{"text":"This place has some amazing food with ok service.  Every time I've been the the wait staff seems like they can't wait to leave.   Other than that the place is great. The food is spectacular. I had the brisket with Mac n cheese. The meat is good enough you won't need Bbq sauce.   It was in the taste of Pittsburgh magazine (which is the best magazine in town for reviews) deservedly so."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and was pleasantly surprised. My daughter loved the Mac and Cheese and the ribs. The pulled pork sandwich was great. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Got take out to try a few things so we could decide if we wanted to use them for an event.onion basket....salty and soggy. Couldn't even re-fry or reheat in the oven. Disgusting. Garbage. Babyback ribs so over cooked they were inedible. St Louis ribs the same..very dry and chewy. Mashed potatoes, baked beans, coleslaw..over priced and awful.  Brisket...delicious. Melt in your mouth. I would never get ribs or any side again from there again, but the brisket was great."}
{"text":"Customer service is so great. The gentlemen who seems to always be there takes care of every customer- opens doors, carries the food out to my car when I get take out, gets a million refills for drinks. And the food is great, never had anything I don't like! Bravo!"}
{"text":"Great Food that is not the norm in Washington and Canonsburg.  if you want to spend an extra 15 minutes compared to fast food off the exit it is well worth it.  good size portions and that southern bbq flavor"}
{"text":"Great bbq... Pulled pork is sweet and spicy. Feels good going in... Another story coming out (if you know what I mean)   Staff is always very friendly. I came in to pick up an order and they offered me a free beverage.   The restaurant itself has seen better days. Everything. Could use a nice wipe down."}
{"text":"Foods ok but I've never been to a bbq place that cooks there meat on a indoor grill and covered it in sauce and called it bbq. If you're looking for grilled meat with sauce this place is for you."}
{"text":"Good BBQ is hard to come by in Pennsylvania, but Hog Fathers is a great choice! Very small inside so we usually order take out. Cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This was really a very bad meal. I ordered the brisket salad. The iceberg lettuce was watery, the fries were cold, & the brisket was dry as toast. My son had the BBQ chicken & it was a much better choice. I pushed my almost full plate to the side to indicate that I was finished. The server asked if I needed a take home box & I politely declined the offer. I always tip 20% for service; bad food is not her fault. A better restaurant would have made some type of restitution."}
{"text":"It is not a good sign when I walk into the establishment and can't sit at their bar area because the top of the bar has been reassigned as the catering/take out facility.  There are donuts (which they don't serve), boxes, bags, aaaannndd....trays of Jenny Lee cornbread that is being cut, scooped and placed into catering containers for their customers!!!  You are serving someone else's cornbread that you can find in the grocery store to your customers and passing it off as your own???  Are you kidding me???  And I know they do make their own because of the photos that others have taken and placed on this page look different than what I saw today.  How humiliating.  So I ordered a pulled pork sandwich and mac and cheese.  Benefit of the doubt, the host/cashier/take out girl was nice, pleasant and sounded enthusiastic when describing the mac&cheese so I figured, what the hell...let's go for it.  Ugh...poor choice!  Save yourself the trouble, DON'T get that item.  It's alfredo sauce with cavatappi noodles....extreme disappointment.  Oh, they melted a speck of shredded cheddar on top for garnishment, oh great, maybe now I'll really enjoy it....  The pulled pork was good, and my girls recommendation for the red sauce was very nice, but they mixed these fried onion straws in with the meat and ruined it!!!!  All you tasted were fried onions, woorst evvvaaa!  They also threw jalapenos into the mix to spice it up I guess....poor idea again.  Everything they were doing was taking the flavor AWAY from the meat.  If you are going to try this place, take my advice.  Get the pork sandwich without that garbage, you'll be happier than a pig in ......"}
{"text":"First time here. Really good BBQ. Our group had the 1/2lb burger, Mac and cheese, ribs, chicken, sausage, and sides. Tried them all. Liked them all."}
{"text":"Hog Fathers opened a new place in Canonsburg about one month ago.  Never been to the original but get to Canonsburg frequently and was looking for a good lunch.  The restaurant is nice and in a newer little strip mall.  The place was jumping.  The baby back ribs were good, with some smoke flavor, not overcooked, and tender.  The ribs were completed on a grill with the sauce.  The sauce was OK, but not great.   The ribs were not over sauced, like many places.   For sides the sweet potato fries were rather ordinary.  The baked beans were tasty, sweet (must have a little brown sugar in the recipe) and had some pulled pork to add some flavor.     The service was good, friendly and the food came out pretty fast for a crowded place.  Sat at the counter since all the tables were full."}
{"text":"I've ordered take out a few times and it's always top notch. I've had the ribs, pulled pork sandwich, southern fried chicken, baked beans, sweet potato fries, garlic mashed potatoes, cornbread, and carrot cake. Everything is delicious. Nothing is overly sauced and the chicken is lightly breaded & very tasty. Southwestern PA is no Carolina, Tennessee, or Texas when it comes to barbecue, but Hog fathers does well for itself.  The only complaint I could make is concerning the service. The people are friendly and helpful, but there seems to be a lack of coordination and structure. My food was ready and waiting for me the last time I picked up takeout (today), but I still spent more than 5-7 minutes inside the restaurant as the first person in line at the counter. That aside, it's really nice that they bring the food around to the outside of the counter, rather than handing it to you from behind it.  Unless you have a \"bbq-guy\", give this place a try."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic 'brisket fajita wrap'--not something you find every day. Twice-baked potato soup very good too. A dining partner got an overcooked burger (ordered medium well and it was def well done), so watch for that. Great service too!"}
{"text":"Honestly I was hesitant going to this restaurant because of the reviews. However, I'm glad I did because my husband and I really enjoyed the food.   We had the chili cheese fries appetizer and it was yummy! I had the beef brisket dinner and my husband had the half rack. The meat from the ribs fell off the bone and my brisket was no where near dry, it was tender. I asked for BBQ sauce and that was good too - tangy and just the right amount of sweetness. (In my opinion, they should keep their BBQ sauce available on the tables.)   We were both satisfied and stuffed at the end of our dinner. My only small complaint was that the baked beans and mashed potatoes came out a little cold. Besides that, they were both good. Portions are huge, service was good and waitress was attentive. We will be going back again."}
