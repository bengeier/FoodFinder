{"text":"Ever since the son took over, you would have expected more of a modern touch. Yes they added salads which is great, but you need to ask for all dressed or else all you get is ICEBERG LETTUCE, DRESSING (mayo, oil, vinegar) and THE MEAT. All-dressed includes: cheese, eggplant, carmelized onion and hot peppers. Sorry for for 10$ a salad, it should be standard.   The coffees are good obviously BUT can they have any other milk than 3.25%. Not asking for Almond or Soy but atleast 1%...something else.   You can either get the guy that's screaming your name for dear life outside holding your coffee waiting for you to flag him down or the nicer ones. Good place when you have nothing else to do but the guys serving seem tired of their jobs a little...smiling is contagious, also you get better tips boys!"}
{"text":"A Montreal staple! If you're in the east end and in the mood for a classic Italian sandwich, Milano's is a must try.  Food: Fresh bread, spicy eggplants in oil, and tasty choice of meats: can't go wrong. Try the stronger than average iced coffee for a post lunch pick-me-up.  Ambience: Classic Italian diner type of place, you'll definitely find some interesting characters. In the summer expect the outdoor seating to be filled.  Tip: try the veal sandwich, ask for the hot peppers if you're looking for an extra kick."}
{"text":"Food: Tasty subs and good salads -the chicken is a bit dry on the salads, though-. A bit overpriced.  Coffee: The Lattes are good -not the best I ever had but still good- and so are the deserts. Depending on the barista, the Lattes may be on the bitter or sour side.  Service and Payment: Cashiers tend to be abrupt -having to deal with smiling customers tends to get on your nerves, I guess- but the waiters are friendly. Cash only.  Atmosphere: The place is casual and well lit but loud.   Hours and convenience: Lots of seating and free parking outside. They tend to serve drinks 24/7 and the kitchen closes at around 4AM, I think."}
{"text":"I adore Milano, the food is certainly excellent but the space, luminous rooms, terrace and great social scene are also unique. It's like a kaleidoscope of Italian Montreal, young, old, suburban Italian princesses, old guys and it's awesome. The espressi and HUGE cannolis are among the best in town and the sandwiches are fairly good, but they could be even better if really good bread was used - instead of the cardoard, slightly tasteless one. Great social spot though and all-around good times."}
{"text":"Holy crap!! Their sangwiches are amazing bro.  The cannolis are super amazing and their coffee is seriously good.  It's far from the downtown area but well worth the drive."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a bite at any hour. The coffee is good, sandwiches are good, great ambience. I come here once a week."}
{"text":"I have very slim experience in tasting cannoli. So this is one of the few places where I first tasted this Italian dessert. As a beginner, I would say above level of expectation on this. Will return to get more on special occasions."}
{"text":"Great local hangout, not a great eatery.   Rather good coffee aside, the foremost thing I can say about Milano's food is it's oily. Everything is covered in oil (blessing in disguise), if it weren't for the oil you would notice how dry and overcooked the sandwich meat is. The bread is painfully tough, and even the salads are swimming in oily dressing. 3 stars is only because it's a cafe, as an eatery it would fare much worse."}
{"text":"WARNING. Sandwiches and apple turnovers are good. But the ATM they force you to use because they don't accept debit or credit is FRAUDULENT. The machine stole my information, and a few days later, purchases were made at nearby establishments (in St. Leonard). I was only in Montreal for one day and this was the only debit machine I used. They need to get a new debit machine, or start accepting cards like a 2016 establishment."}
{"text":"Awesome Subs!!! Best in Montreal & you can top them however you want!!!! Good price $$$ nice people"}
{"text":"This is the mecca of Gino's and Mary's! But MAN are the sangwiches good!! LOL The madhouse called Milano's is a place to chill back, have a Brio and a panini stuffed with the goodness of sausage and peppers, or Mortatella and provolone. I also have to say that the Chopped chicken salads are DA BOMB!  Go and hang out, even if you aren't Italian you will feel like you are after one bite!"}
{"text":"Busy place with a genuine Italian spirit. Went there for a business meeting: they have a big room downstairs equipped with big TV screens you can connect a PC to and very efficient AC comfortable enough to fit 20 people.  Subs and salads are fresh and lively, service is fast and it feels like Italy indeed."}
{"text":"This is a very homey restaurant that's very much a part of the St. Leonard culture. I've been here a couple times in the afternoon, and it has a very comfortable, almost family-like atmosphere. There seems to be clientele of all ages, from high school students to old-folk who congregate here for a classic Italian sandwich and coffee.   I had a café au lait, which was not served in a French style (porcelain cup/bowl), but was  served in a small tumbler glass. It had a layer of micro foam on top, so it resembled a piccolo latte much more than a cafe au lait. The coffee was smooth, but strangely, it was not very hot. It tasted good, but it was not what I was expecting.  I'm really curious to know how their cafe au lait differs from the \"latte\" offered on their menu.  I heard their sandwiches are great; if I ever return, I will have to try one of their classic Italian sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Addictive sandwiches.  It was bustling and the servers run around bringing your orders to the table after you give it at the counter.  There are mix-ups but I think it is part of the charm because if they missed your order they apologize profusely and hustle to get your food.  The buns are deliciously pliant and beautifully buttered filled to brim with whatever you ordered.  They put in traditional Italian gardiniere with your protein so the flavours are warm and delicious.  I do not want to go back here because of the amount of food I inhale but it is addictive.  I am craving the tuna sandwich now.  Yummy."}
{"text":"The terrace is always full. Get there early. The lineup  is worth the wait. New \"porchetta\" sandwich is a winner. Just like Mama's home cooking. Dog-friendly. We brought our dogs and they brought water for them. How nice is that!"}
{"text":"Cafe Milano's, a classic St. Leonard staple. If you're from the east end, you've probably had Milano's at least once in your life. It's part of St.Leo culture.   They're known for their paninis. You could order anything from a cold cut panini to a chicken or veal cutlet panini or even a steak sub.   The food is good, fills you up. However, I feel as though I could make better ones at my place.   I also find it a little bit pricey. 10$ for a sandwich seems a little on the high end.   It's good, but there's better.  Also, it is open until 4:00am. Therefore if you're getting the late night munchies, skip the fast food joints and head over to Milano's. It's obviously the better choice :)"}
{"text":"Growing up in the North-East side of Montreal, Milano's was an often late night or after school spot that my friends and I would hit up.  The coffees and pastries were still decent, the cakes were OK, the cannolis were still good.  The sandwiches are really oily, and kinda lacks in flavour. I used to order them with extra hot peppers and extra eggplants, that usually does the trick. Without it it can be quite dry. It's a decent place to hit up after a night out before heading back home if you are in the area.  The mac and cheese nuggets and onion rings kinda suck."}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches! I always make a point of stopping in when I'm in the area. Love the marinated eggplant. Great coffee as well.   Now if I could only explain to the locals that \"passing\" in foozball is the proper way to play I'd give it 5* ;)"}
{"text":"Being from the South Shore, we are rarely in St.Leonard so I had never heard about this place until recently (through Yelp of course) Around 11pm, we were in the area and were thinking of grabbing a coffee from Tim's but out of curiosity, searched on Yelp if anything else is open. It truly was a surprise to find a non-chain café that's open 24hrs!  The place had a line up and was buzzing, filled with people of all ages from large families to couples and students. Despite having such a large seating-area inside, it took a while before we were able to get a seat - I guess the family-like atmosphere doesn't let anyone leave!  After reading the reviews, we had to try the famous Cannolis (which definitely lived up to their reputation - delicious!). I also had a Mocha which was served in a small glass - a bit disappointing for its price and average quality.  Overall, would definitely return for the lovely atmosphere and cannolis!"}
{"text":"Nostalgia is a fickle thing. I used to come here regularly during my clubbing days (at least when I struck out...) at 3 am. I remembered really enjoying these sandwiches due to me either being famished or being half drunk and I guess hanging out here with friends and enjoying a sandwich and a drink can be a lot of fun.  Anyways.... let's talk about the grub.   Milano serves Italian styled sandwiches and you can get it either a 7 inch panini or a 10 inch panini. They are sold without combo options at around $10 each which makes them a little pricey for what they are. They have a variety of sandwiches such as steak subs, chicken, veal, eggplant, porchetta....and overall they're good but ill be honest and state I've had better elsewhere. In fact, there are much better options not far away from Cafe Milano but sadly they're not open at all hours like Cafe Milano is. I guess you take what you can get.  I had their onion rings as well during my last visit and they were just OK. They are a little spicy and on that note for those of you who like spicy, the sandwiches can be made quite spicy to your pleasure.   They also have coffee (it is a cafe after all) as well as Italian pastries like cannoli. I didn't partake this time around but they do have a solid reputation in this regard. They also have a large eating area that is pretty chill with lots of room. They also have a terrace upside which can be great during the summer. They also serve salads now."}
{"text":"Nous sommes ici au coeur d'une institution italo-montréalaise. Fondée en 1971 par la famille Paranzino (originaire de la région de Molise), Milano existe depuis 1971. D'ailleurs, pour en savoir plus sur l'histoire de Matteo et Marco Paranzino, je vous recommande d'acheter le livre Montrealissimo qui dresse un portrait émouvant et passionnant sur les Italiens établis à Montréal.  Au fil des ans, l'entreprise familiale a connu une belle croissance et lorsque le fils a pris les rennes du commerce, s'est ajoutée une magnifique terrasse animée matin, midi et soir... lorsque le temps le permet ! Mais plus encore, Milano est devenue une référence pour la qualité de son café (ils font bien l'espresso doppio), le choix des sandwichs préparés comme à la maison, sans oublier le goût de ses cannolli et d ses zeppole (dans mon top 5).  Milano est ouvert 24 heures sur 24. Il n'est pas rare qu'à une heure ou deux du matin, après avoir fêté, on s'y retrouve pour un dernier café ou une collation rapide avant d'aller dormir ! Tôt le matin, au comptoir, des travailleurs y font un arrêt obligé pour un espresso plus que nécessaire avant de se retrouver au chantier ou derrière un bureau. Le midi et le soir, il y a foule. C'est un peu problématique pour faire la file et commander ce qu'on veut, mais une fois assis à sa place, il suffit d'attendre que le serveur se promène entre les tables en scandant votre prénom pour qu'aussitôt vous recevez votre sandwich ou votre espresso. Une formule quand même assez rapide et qui fait un peu le charme de l'endroit.   Moi qui apprend l'italien intensivement depuis plus de six mois, ce que j'aime parfois faire c'est fermer les yeux pour mieux capter les conversations. On y entend l'italien, certes, mais aussi le sicilien, le napolitain... À force de pratiquer pour progresser, à force aussi de regarder la RAI et d'écouter des artistes comme Pino Daniele (Napoli) ou Mirco Menna (Sicilia), on finit par décoder de très belles choses.   Récemment, Milano s'est (enfin) adapté aux nouvelles technologies en proposant le paiement par carte bancaire. Plus besoin de retirer de l'argent dans la machine atm \"dévoreuse de frais bancaire\" au fond du commerce ! Si on pouvait aussi offrir un service de wifi gratuit, ce serait bien pour des travailleurs autonomes comme moi !"}
{"text":"Pro: Wonderful sandwich place to meet up with friends. Great salads. Awesome desserts. Very good services.   Con: Parking hard to find during lunch hours."}
{"text":"Italian hangout place, Open late for great sausage sandwiches. Not a restaurant but a type of restobar. It's not downtown but on the north east side of Montreal, transportation there is difficult without a car. If you are in the area and what an Italian coffee and a grilled sausage sandwich it's the place to go."}
{"text":"Ouvert 24/24, un plus à mon avis. Situé à St-Léonard dans le quartier résidentiel, Café Italien. Çà grouille de monde, la terrasse est pleine à 11:00pm. Des gens de toutes les générations s'y retrouvent. J'ai été pour y prendre un sandwich pour apporter. Ils sont préparés comme de bons sandwich maison. Le poulet est un peu sec et fade. Les desserts sont succulents!!!! Gâteaux au fromage, GROS biscuits aux brisures de chocolats moelleux, cannolis, crêpes fourrées au Dolce de Leche, yummm tous délectables! Très bons cafés."}
{"text":"Busy spot for a quick bite and coffee (of course). Indoors it can get quite loud.   Service is decent. The poutine was really good. The fries are cut like beams and are nice and crispy. The gravy is just right, not too salty, hot enough to melt the grated cheese.   The Milano sandwiches are light and packed with ingredients but not very filling."}
{"text":"Love their sausage sandwich and cutlet sandwich but don't eat the pulled pork. Not good at all. It was dry and bland. Overall very great place to grab a coffee, talk business or hang with some friends."}
{"text":"They have hands down one of the best cannolis in Montreal. They also make great zeppole and other pastries, and coffee.   The place is usually lively, and their parking lot tends to be packed. It's also open very late, which is a plus. The cafe is spacious enough to accommodate groups, making it great for get togethers for coffee and food.  All in all, it's a good cafe with good food and great cannolis."}
{"text":"WAY TOO LOUD.... I SAID... WAY TO LOUD. Plus the sammiches are not what they used to be. Sure they cleaned up the restaurant, looks less divey but the food is what took a dive. I remember having a sammich there and wanting to stuff my face with 3 more... Now it's mostly condiments and less target-hitting. When I want a sausage sammich, I want the sausage pipping hot and preferably juicy instead of slightly warm and drier than a desert. Ain't what it used to be."}
{"text":"I call this place the \"St. Leonard Community Centre\" because it seems that every time I go, the whole neighbourhood congregates there. What can I say? The sangwich is the best you'll ever have. The first time I took my fiancée there, who had never been, she fell in love, and understood me on a whole deeper level from that day forward. Yes, it's that powerful. We live in NDG, but that doesn't stop us from taking the 30 minute drive on the Met to get here when we have a craving, and that's often. Minchia!"}
{"text":"amazing coffee...great italian style salads and great panini's! i love the way they ask you to get a table and the waiter yells around you name until he finds you! very italian joint...very italian! bada bing bada bing! oops.... i didnt wear my addidas fitted track pants with my Canada Goose! lol"}
{"text":"Good pastries strong coffee nice atmosphere and decent sandwiches make this a delight to spend an afternoon hanging out with friends. It's not gourmet but it definitely gets the job done nevertheless ! I would go back except it is out in St Leonard"}
{"text":"Very nice local Restaurant/Italian Cafe type place. Really great for an nice hang out time with friends, great sandwich or a nice dessert with an espresso or cappuccino.  The service has always been friendly and pleasant every time I have visited, sandwich are really good as is the decadent desserts and coffee is never a disappointment. The restaurant can get a quite noisy when full as its more a hang out type place then a sit down meal, hence 4/5 stars.  Yep 4/5 thumbs up! Local at its best! Tip: Try the sandwiches and Canolis ;)"}
{"text":"Relaxing place to be, nice terrace and good variety menu but only takes cash... Last time I was there the ATM didn't work either, although I don't really like using my card with unknown ATM machines. They should at least have debit...or Apple Pay. Other then that. Order at the counter and food at your table. Would go back for coffee break."}
{"text":"Petit café italien ouvert 24/24h avec une ambiance unique où les différentes générations se croisent et se mélangent sans problèmes. Vous allez chez Milano pour déguster les meilleurs cannolis, manger un de leur succulent sandwich ou simplement prendre un café sur la terasse et admirer le passage de gens si différents mais si uniques. Définitivement mon café italien préféré!"}
