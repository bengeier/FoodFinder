{"text":"Great Pupusas and Natural Juices! They also do Catering!  They are located inside of Galaxy Foods."}
{"text":"The Pernil was actually really juicy. We ordered to go and while we waited for the Pupusas  my daughters ate all the rice and Pernil leaving me just a few bits. Normally I have to go eat this at grandmas house but being able to pick it up along with my groceries was a treat."}
{"text":"This place is located in the grocery store. Delicious cafeteria style meals. They also serve made to order plates. The food is all made from scratch and you can definitely tell. The food that was on the line for the evening was PuertoRican style; habichuelas guisadas, pernil, platano frito, empanadillas. Of course there was more than that. We were even able to sample the dishes before ordering. They have fresh made juices as well. The service was exceptional. We aren't from this part of town but the staff was super welcoming and ensured we were happy with our meals. If you're looking for a quick cheap bite then this place is a good pick."}
