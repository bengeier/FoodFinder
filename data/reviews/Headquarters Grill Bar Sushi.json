{"text":"Great NEW place! Food and service was amazing. It was hard to decide what to order because everything sounded so delicious! They even have a sushi bar. Came for dinner and now for brunch! Headquarters is a great spot for sports, music and dancing!"}
{"text":"Hq did the Super Bowl the right way!!! Had some fun with interactive games and some fantastic specials! It had been a great time bring some friends for the best experience!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. We are definitely 'regulars' here. The owner Adam and his dad Harvey are great. We like to go on Tuesday's for $2 Taps and Wednesday's for half off food. They have specials pretty much every day though. Service is usually awesome and food is on point.  My husband and I like  that one of us can get sushi and one can get a burger all while watching sports on TV.  You won't be disappointed at HQ!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Sam our waiter was great. He was so pleasant and gave recommendations. He never left a glass empty. Food was great. We started w the spinach artichoke dip which was really awesome. The blend of cheeses was amazing. I had sushi which was fresh. Husband had Philly cheesesteak bread was good said could have more cheese. Kids enjoyed their meals. They do have kids menus. Friendly staff. We even met Harvey. He goes around to talk with all the guests. Great guy. Can not wait to go back for there specials and happy hour. The desserts were awesome. Make sure you try one."}
{"text":"We were really excited to try this place but after waiting fifteen minutes for a server and then fifteen minutes for our drinks we decided to just leave. The server caught us on the way out and said \"uh what's the problem?\" Disappointing."}
{"text":"Great service! Very friendly staff. The sushi was  delicious and the grandmas donuts are to die for!!! Adam our server was great! We will come back! Great place!"}
{"text":"Screens everywhere, friendly (but rushed) waiters. DJ keeping the ambience going during game commercial breaks. Awesome drink specials- we had burgers and sushi in our group, it  was all super tasty. The waitress did forget to bring the only alcoholic beverage our party ordered (bloody mary). All in all, this place is great and will definitely be here again."}
{"text":"We have been to Headquarters about 7-8 times now and it never disappoints.  The owners are involved and approachable.  We try to give non-chain restaurants our business and we are glad we found this place so hopefully it sticks.  Great, casual place to have a drink and dinner/app and watch a game.  Good specials on Tuesday & Wednesday nights also!"}
{"text":"Oklahomans went here with family. Totally enjoyed every aspect of the place. Food was great and very friendly atmosphere - one of the partners who owns the place and his Dad took time to visit with us. Daughter & Son-in-law moving to the area will make many return visits!"}
{"text":"We drive thirty miles from Mesa just to have sushi made for us by Paul at Headquarters. We've been eating sushi for years, and his customer service and skill are superb. He introduced us to fresh wasabi and we always ask for it now. 

We've always had a pleasant experience. The place is clean, classy, and able to fit a large amount of people without feeling overcrowded. There's a variety of sporting events on flat-screen tvs throughout. The music is modern but not overdone. We've never waited for a table, get remembered even if it's been awhile, and never feel rushed or get treated like a number. The prices are reasonable and there are plenty of opportunities for discounts or happy hour.

The owner Adam Weiss stopped by not just to check in, but to sit and ask us for feedback on our experience. He was engaging and personable. We look forward to having date night again here soon. Let us know when you're opening in the East Valley - you'd sweep the market south of Scottsdale. I'll bring at least eight people if you come out this way!"}
{"text":"This place was terrible, we were having a party and had reserved an area for our party to sit. However they also seated other people that we didn't know in our area as well and then divided our party in half by placing the people that were not in a party right in the middle of the room separating our party in half. The service was terrible, very slow and they seemed to be upset we were there to begin with. And to top it off management out and 18% gratuity on top of our bill because we were a group over a number of people that I think was 12. I informed the server to take the 18 percent off my bill as I was not paying extra for bad service. Of course the assistant manager came out to talk to me I explained it to her then the manager came out and I explained it to him that I was not paying the 18% because of the lousy service that we had received. It was finally ended when he said \"fine, pay your bill and never come back!\" I informed him that I would never return to the establishment, i also informed him I would write a review about the service, his answer was \" I don't care, go ahead.\" This was the first and last time I so ever go in this place!"}
{"text":"Ok, I am one that has never written a review about food. HI have always given a new place of business a chance to see what they have to offer. The restaurant business is a tricky business. It can make or break your decision on whether or not you will become a repeat patron. My wife and I decided to try a new establishment by our residence in North Phoenix, AZ. Headquarters AZ  is a Bar and Grill that serves common fare food such as burgers, Sandwiches, salads, some sea food appetizers like Calamari, Shrimp and so on. I ordered the Philly Cheese Steak, my wife had the Shrimp Salad. Well, the Philly was so dry and had no flavor, the price was fairly priced, but the presentation of the food was bland as the sandwich. My wife's salad was so plain and lacked flavor. The ingredients which it lacked were so blah it was pretty grim. We met one of the family members of the owner and he talked with us for a moment building up our dining expectations. Telling us how great the food would be, how fresh everything is and how they knew food. They had moved from Las Vegas and had owned a larger establishment there. What a let down. Headquarters Bar and Grill needs work in the food and service department bad. The place looks good with all the the T.Vs all around and is very spacious, but lacks ambience. If you like bland food, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Food and service were great. Wonderful patio to sit at. We tried 3 appetizers and 4 different meals plus a dessert and was all great!"}
{"text":"When you work evenings, it isn't always easy to find a nice place for dinner. It is fantastic to find a place that is open late (food served until 1 AM!) that can also satisfy both my appetite for raw fish and my husband's need to eat wings and hamburgers. This is definitely one of the classiest and cleanest sports bars that I have ever been to. Furthermore, the staff are friendly and sincere. The owner even came out to talk to us and make sure that we were OK. 

I tried several sushi rolls and the pork spring rolls. It was all tasty, if maybe not the very best that I have ever had. However, if you come Wednesday evening, all of the traditional rolls and a lot of other menu items are half off, and who can beat that price? I think this may be a deal to celebrate their recent opening, so if you want half off Wednesdays, you may want to stop by soon. I know I will be back. I hear they make homemade donuts, and I need to find out if their half pound Angus hamburgers are as big as my head or not."}
{"text":"Love this place. Best Artichoke dip in the city! Tuesday and Wednesday specials are the bomb. Keep up the great work Adam!!!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times.  Last was for my son's birthday.  Everything's been great so far. Hard to beat the Cilantro lime chicken.  Staff was great service too. Never had a problem but know they would fix it if I did.
We will be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Customer service is A+ and the food is so delicious. Great atmosphere and I love that the owners dad always comes by to our table to say hello. Would totally recommend to friends and family."}
{"text":"Great service, the ape pie roll..to die for..
Service and food so great..sushi great, ribs, and blackened steak bites..yum"}
{"text":"Fabulous service, food quality \"top notch\" 
Pizza crust chewy yet soft with a crisp to it, great!
wings out of this world smoked the flash fried and the burger best ground beef around! Alan (the owners) father a REAL ASSET to the establishment...we found our new home...our establishment for everything! Good job all around! Great experience!!"}
{"text":"We moved to Peoria AZ in February. We have sampled bars/restaurants in the P83 area. We had yet to find \"the one\" place. The place with the great area, friendly atmosphere, family orientated, great food, great happy hour food and drink specials. We heard from others that HEADQUARTERS was the new place, the place to that was going to be the new P83!. Today we ventured out to try IT!.... I was impressed, I HIGHLY recommend and above all this is going to be the go to place come football season. They have a great SEASON TICKET PROGRAM for football season, that offers Sunday discounts! I have children, I like to have an alcohol beverage, I like to catch a sports game. This is the place to be. Over 30 flat screen TV's, It's not dark- windows that roll up come weather season and room off to the side for your own projection room. This place is worth checking out. The service was wonderful, you felt important. Harvey, Adam, Ava and Lena AWESOME! I look forward to going back. I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE going here on our date nights. They have a DJ as well as sports on several tv's. We ask for the same waiter, Jaden, because he makes sure our experience is enjoyable. We have tried several dishes and have yet to be disappointed. Another good thing...the owner is accessible. He walks around and mingled. One of our favorite places!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent. Great variety, something for everyone. Favorite dish besides the sushi is the Mongolian beef lettuce wraps. Service could get a little better but I understand it's hard to find some gems with personality these days."}
{"text":"There is a very strong musty smell that lingers. It is impossible to get used to. Smells like old mop water and the staff is not one bit friendly"}
{"text":"Came to watch Sunday football. The music was so loud there was no way we could enjoy the games, so we left."}
{"text":"Yaaaas!!! Come here! Put ur Google maps on to this location because the food and drinks are amazing! And the cherry on top is the service is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Waited 1 hour for an order that never came ....  not even that busy....  got to the place at 530 by 630 still no food and the place was half empty.  Very poor customer service on this day.   Too bad I had higher hopes."}
{"text":"Great place to go to watch the game and get drinks and food! They always have great specials too!  The service is always impeccable and you know the owner cares about the place because he is there too making sure everything is made to your liking! Great new local bar I would definitely recommend trying it out!"}
{"text":"Great food and location , half off Wednesday special was worth the visit and Harvey is a hockey fan so Tuesday nights for hockey will be great. Tasty sushi and nice variety of all food"}
{"text":"We've been here 3x now and have not been disappointed a single time. The staff is exceptionally friendly and interactive without being \"Dutch Brothers\" annoying. The food is always good. So often when a restaurant serves a wide variety of food, they tend to do one thing really well and slack on the other. We have tried so many items on their menu and have been impressed every time.

Yes, I'll admit that the bathroom has a horrible smell. BUT this is a CITY issue that the owners have been continuously trying to get resolved. The bathrooms are still very, very clean. Overall, this place is an exceptional establishment. The owners and employees all have a sincere since of pride that overflows into their service. I'd give this place 5 stars 100x over just so people would show up and support this business."}
{"text":"First timers for lunch and the food was fresh, delicious, and service was great. Not your cookie cutter chain food. We were so pleased and desserts are fantastic. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The staff was slow to take our order both times we went. Once was around 2 o'clock on Sunday and the second time was Saturday night around 730 pm. They had plenty of staff too. Food was good tho besides them charging me .25 cents extra for salsa they recommended for my chicken tacos. :( which I found odd.."}
{"text":"Just went here for the first time yesterday. Was not impressed by the mixed drinks at all. First thing our waiter says is that they are getting rid of 3 of them because they get sent back all the time. The drink i first ordered was the Red Mule, and that was complete ass. I then order an Old Fashioned, too sweet and they're not meant to be sweet. I then ordered beer and that was perfect, kinda hard to mess up beer... lmao. For food i ordered sushi, and surprisingly that was really good. Some advice is not to order any mixed drinks. I believe their bartenders need help"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch with some co-workers.  The interior is nice and modern.  More TV's than you know what to look at.  Ordered the pizza lunch special and sushi.  The pizza was pretty bland and reminded me of Peter Piper Pizza.  Sushi was OK but would rather go to one of the 2 sushi restaurants that are next door.  Prices for sushi seemed a little high.  Service was slow, especially for lunch and having only about 10 parties in the whole restaurant.  This place is fairly new so they may just need some time to work out the kinks.  Will try them again in a couple months to see if it has improved."}
{"text":"Service was eh.  Nothing good or bad to say about it so they were just eh.  Good food though.  I highly recommend their Korean braised beef tacos."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! Great drink specials and amazing food for a great price! I've been coming here since it opened and am here on a half off food Wednesday eating a lime chicken meal. They have a half off food menu with great deals. About $8 and you get a gourmet meal with a great atmosphere. The owners are super friendly as well"}
{"text":"We love everything about HQ!! Every meal we've ever ordered is Excellent! As well as the food presentation which isn't important to me but is for some. My 2 Favorites and must tries are the Shrimp and Calamari as well as the Spicy Tuna Roll!! The service is great as well as the atmosphere. I especially like how Adam and Harvey come and greet every table and stay and chat. Both are very friendly and put a special touch on the place!"}
{"text":"HQ Grill has a diverse menu of sushi, burgers, pizza and more! Jaden was our server and he was fantastic with his recommendations. We had the pork spring rolls that were amazing! Then had a Rainbow Roll, fresh and delicious. The Buffalo pizza was great...crust light and flaky! Happy hour happiness..."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Great food with some different menu items you've never tasted, but will come back for.  Adam the owner and his father know how to treat customers.  Very friendly and accommodating, which shows in the way their staff treats you as well. Our favorite place to hang out now.  Come check it out!"}
{"text":"From the friendly hostess, and the amazing server Nick, the amazing food, fish and chips and sushi were delicious! It was a great night to sit on the patio underneath the misters, and we were also greeted by \"loudmouth Dad\" who made us smile and let us in on all the deals ! They have brunch too! I will be back for sure ! Thanks!"}
{"text":"I enjoy the food here. I love the fried pickles and sliders. It's never that busy so it's easy to get a table in. But the costumer service sucks. The hostess when I come in is the same girl and I believe her name is Kaylee. She's awesome, she greets people the minute they walk in and makes sure every table is doing okay. Kiara was my server once and she was super nice! She made me want to come back! But lately I've had this server named Autumn. She is very rude and doesn't check on our table for thirty minutes. She doesn't want to come to our table so she makes Kaylee help us. One time I had to change my order from dinning in, to a Togo order and she snatched my plates off my table and rolled her eyes. Recently she had Kaylee even take our orders for her and then came back to our table because she was mad that she forgot to ask us one specific question."}
{"text":"This place is a great local sports bar. We always have a good time here and the owner Adam always takes care of us! They have a DJ on the weekends and great shots!"}
{"text":"If your looking for a great experience with awesome specials, HQ is the place to go.  The food quality was great prices are good. Was all around a good time"}
{"text":"This review is geared strickly towards the service we received today. Our server Autumn, was absolutely on point as far as everything a server could be. Having worked in the service industry for 20 plus years all I can say is that she definitely has her stuff together and provides top-notch service. The food was awesome, but the service made it stellar."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! I used to do my Thirsty Thursday's at Westgate since its a little closer to my house, but one of the bartenders we became friends with (Emily) made the switch to Headquarters so we came to check it out. Was supposed to be just a one-time deal, but the food was good, the staff was very friendly and attentive and the bartenders are awesome! We've been doing happy hour here every Thursday now."}
{"text":"Definitely my new spot... love this place. Sara and Erika are so welcoming whether I'm at a table or at the bar. Buffalo chicken sliders and philly cheese steak are my go to! But everything I've tired has been top notch. AWESOME!!! Can't wait to spend the 4th here with the two greatest staff members you have."}
{"text":"Stopped in at 5 pm to see a movie at 7 pm across the street at harkins.
We thought we would have a couple drinks and a appetizers.
We asked to be seated on the patio.
We looked to be the second couple seated.
We sat patently while the vampire waitress waited on the other couple and all the other couples that had been seated Since are arrival,
We waited 20 minutes or so. Noticed every couple that came in already had there drinks.
We on the other hand had not been approached.
After the third time the waitress waited on the couple next to us we decided to relocate 
We walked across the parking lot to modern round.
Not only was it a much nicer establishment.
We sat promptly . Had the best service and drinks,food and atmosphere was much nicer experience we have had with headquarters.


Do yourself a favor upgrade your experience for the same money and try modern round."}
{"text":"I actually ordered some food from here thru UberEats.  I got some sushi, and I just have to say it was some seriously good sushi!  The Arizona Roll was delightfully spicy, the Rainbow Roll was great and the Surf and Turf Roll was a gamble for me, I wasn't sure if I'd really like it, but turns out to be freaking AMAZING.  I will definitely order from here again, stop by the place, and try some of their other offerings.  Yummy!"}
{"text":"I had a really bad experience with Uber Eats.  This was the fault of the app and not the restaurant.  The owner got on the phone with me and then called Uber to fight for me.  He did not have any luck and neither did I.  He told me he hoped i would give the place a try and I told him I would.

My wife and I took our rare date night  here tonight.  I was a little shocked when our apps came out just after our meals (we ordered them at the same time and may have worded them as part of our meal and right as a game was letting out).  I was set to complain and leave. But then  OMG then i opened my mouth and took a bite.  It would not stop!! the flavor of the not greasy cheese steak and the perfectly cooked calamari and the excellently paired BBQ pork spring rolls oh an then my wife's perfect chicken burger!  I had no time to complain once i started eating.

The food was off the charts good! The server admitted she was new, but was SO well trained, I thought she had been there forever!  From the service to the food, we will be coming back forever!  I will tell my friends and family to eat here and will never stop.

I know there are many other places in the area and i also know that this place has some not so good reviews.  I ignored it all.  I hope you do too.  This is not a chain or corporate place.  It is run by real people who really care.  They are on site to help if needed.  I am a realist, perfection in a restaurant with so many working parts is hard!  This place nails it 9 out of 10 times!!!!  If you are number 10, give it another shot!  They make it right (not meaning they give the house away.  I mean they need to not lose money to keep making this great food) by giving you what you needed and maybe buying you a round of drinks.  

Also, it is a bar and restaurant.  If you come at 8pm and complain that the atmosphere was a bar, well DUH!!!!  Eat with your 5 year old at a normal time people!!!!  They are a business and wont gear it to the 5% that eat dinner at the wrong time with a young family!!

In conclusion, the food is beyond great!  The service is better than most high end restaurants i eat at.  I will be back and WILL bring clients with me!  The owners are great and the servers are top notch!  

Thank you all for a great night and for being out going real people!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and each time hoped it would get better. Positives are the craft beer selection and the outside patio. Their menu is ok. I thought the sushi and bar food concept was a fun idea but the bar food selection isn't great and leaves little to be desired. The last time I was there they told my friend they were out of a 2 times she requested, one being a steak and I can't recall the other. My mother in law also had issues with their wine pours being under the measurements which was corrected after she spoke to a manager. I won't say I will never go back should someone invite me for drinks but I won't choose to go here."}
{"text":"Went here today with 3 friends for lunch and we were all of the same opinion - mediocre at best. They have Sushi, burgers, salads, etc., but all options in our opinions, were over priced. We were the only table occupied at noon and the service was still very slow in coming. This is at least the 4th restaurant in this location, which I must say is great, that has tried to make a go of it. It won't succeed with prices this high, same as those restaurants before them. It's just another sports bar with high priced food.  Won't go back."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to go! We love the food and they have such a variety for the whole family to find something they like. My son chose this place for his birthday dinner at 12 years old, he loves the food and that he is able to watch sports! We had a table of 25 people and it happened to fall on the happy hour Wednesday so they informed me it may take some time getting food out. But they didn't disappoint! Food came out in a timely manner and service was great by Marisa! I would recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Good food, philly Cheesesteak rolls are great, just heard the owner is not very nice and does t treat his employees well. I always use uber eats for this place though so I haven't actually sat down there."}
{"text":"2nd time here and I have to say another great experience!!  Love the tvs!  Salmon is amazing!  Sushi is fabulous!!!    Shout out to Jake the busser!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to hang out and relax. So many choices for special brews. Good food, gray service,  nice place to be worth friends."}
{"text":"Tried this place out last night for the first time. We sat at the bar and were completely ignored. It took us 15 minutes for a bartender to acknowledge us and another 5-10 minutes for our drinks. Then we were given the wrong drinks. We tried to flag down a bartender to no avail. We kept asking for the bill. 20 minutes later they finally brought it. This was the only instance in my entire life where I did not leave a tip. They're lucky we had the patience to wait as long as we did for our check. Not going here again."}
{"text":"Wandered in during a storm after a movie. We were greeted warmly, seated quickly and server checked in with us immediately. Ordered blackened steak bites and chips and mango, apple shrimp salad. Both were delicious. Service excellent and support staff ready and eager to help. A very positive experience.  We will go back to try more menu items."}
{"text":"You wouldn't think of coming to a sports bar for sushi but it's good. Tuesdays are the best when all drafts are $2 after 6pm. Pizza, wings, Mac and cheese bars or the sliders are some of our favorites."}
{"text":"Last night, I took my husband out to dinner for his Birthday and wanted to try a place we had never been. Working in the Restaurant Industry , I am extremely selective. After hearing about Headquarters, recently I thought this could possibly be the night to try it out. We arrived, the hostess was lovely she greeted us and took use to our booth. I thought ok now's the time were going to get crappy service. Within a couple minutes Janice arrived at our table with two waters. We we've over the menu and she gave her recommendations. She also showed us the Wednesday Menu where everything is half off, perfect!! We ordered, the chicken quesadilla, the pork braised nachos and and a P83 roll. Everything came out and was absolutely delicious and more than enough for us to just split everything. The owner walked around chatting and welcoming the customers and also a man I believe was his father. They were great and checked on us a few times to make sure everything was ok. After a few drinks & conversation we decided to order the brownie to split it was HUGE and literally melts it your mouth we would have probably devoured it, if we were already so full. What a great experience!!!  I would highly recommend trying this place, their food is delicious, the atmosphere is nice and the owner really seems to genuinely care about his customers and their experience in his restaurant! Rating 5 stars, because they definitely deserve it."}
{"text":"Excellent Happy Hours and specials. $2 taps on Tuesday CANNOT BE BEAT! Even the food is amazing, highly recommend the buffalo chicken sliders!!! Recently expanded their fishbowl selections as well except they put ENTIRELY too much ice in there, you're not getting much of what you pay for."}
{"text":"I feel like this restaurant has some identity issues. It was already a weird ambiance when you walk in. My hubby and I went there for a date night before watching Solo. The girls wear short shorts and cut off shirts. A weird mix of Hooters, Chili's, and Chipotle put together.  Told you, weird. Might be our seats that made things more awkward. Our server was sweet when we saw her. She was super busy flirty with the tables full of guys lol. We wanted to order something small and quick. I got the chicken Caesar salad and my husband got the tacos. He got the pork, chicken, and beef tacos. The only one that didn't taste like crap was the beef tacos. Chicken Caesar was good but then again it's a salad! We went on a Tuesday night and they were pretty busy. Maybe this place is for the \"younger\" crowd. Lol. We definitely don't need to go there again. Oh, on a side note... They have \"sushi\" there. I have a really big issue with places that do sushi with no sushi bar/chef. Where the heck are they getting the fresh fish from????"}
{"text":"Poor poor service. No eye contact.  No smiles. No greet. No help. Empty drink. No vibe except rush.  In out get out.  I don't like you"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. If you're looking to grab a delicious casual lunch (or even brunch!), a nice dinner, or watch the big game and grab some wings and drinks with the gang, this is the place to do it!! They have something for everyone at all times! If you want a succulent burger but your wife wants a top-notch salad or excellent sushi- look no further! 
I have been coming here for about 6 months and I don't have one bad thing to say. The food is AMAZING; always hot (unless it's sushi or a salad) with fantastic ingredients that satisfy that pallet every time. 
The sushi deserves a whole other review because it is fantastic. Normally one shouldn't trust sushi from the same place with a slamming' burger, but this place is the one exception!! I've watched the menu double in options! So delicious!! 
6 stars if I could!"}
{"text":"2 stars only for the food. This place is crap to say the least. Trash people drinking watered down drinks with loud music & a creepy old DJ. The food is good I can say that much. But the waitress was horrendous. Probably the worst waitress I've ever had. I was a cocktail waitress in San Diego for a bar that had 10x the traffic this place does and I have zero empathy for bad service. She had like 3 tables and flat ignored us. She took forever to bring drinks, get our order, & kept forgetting us. I'm a good tipper and hardly tipped her. We don't recommend at all."}
{"text":"Great place. Great service. Great food. You gotta come in and ask for Will. He rocks. He recommended this HQ grilled cheese sandwich. It was amazing."}
{"text":"Was looking for a locally owned restaurant and found this place.
The food was awesome, had the deep fried apple pie roll for dessert....OMG
it was spectacular! They have a very unique menu for a sports bar.
Service was great and everyone was very friendly. Give it a try....you'll love this place."}
{"text":"Horrible food. I will never come back to this restaurant. We ordered buffalo chicken sliders, dragon roll, Philly cheesesteak with onion rings, and the \"ultimate\" braised pork nachos. The sliders buns were hard and the meat was dry. The dragon roll was gross! Do not order it! The philly meat was flavorless and the bread was hard. The onion rings were sloggy. The nachos had half melted, half unmelted shredded cheese, little to no meat and a few jalapeños thrown on it. The nachos were just chips I could've made them at home. The food was disgusting!! WE ENDED UP THROWING THE FOOD AWAY BECAUSE IT WAS SO GROSS. Definitely will never order here or recommend."}
{"text":"This place has a great patio for a drink. The shrimp & calamari app is amazing and their burgers are hard to beat!"}
{"text":"So after a bad experience came in and everything was 100x better Erica killed it behind the stick Adam came up to me and made me feel welcome. Every great bar owner knows one very important thing when regulars come in you treat them like family Adam treats people like family. I know where I'm going every sunday come football season"}
{"text":"Well let me start by saying our waiter Jaden was awsome and because of him 3 stars. Its sad to say this place has lack of good food.   We ordered the fried pickles they were actually good.  Then the spinach pizza I found bland in flavor, then the super hero it had no flavor what so ever.   The smothered fries too were bland.  I could not even eat them.  I ordered blue cheese and out came a small container and I was charged .75 cents.  I cant believe it.  This place is right across from the Arrowhead Harkins Theater so they could have a great crowd but if most people like some sort of flabor this is not the place to go and thats sad."}
{"text":"It troubles me to post a review as I have become frustrated with one of my favorite places to eat and drink at. Don't get me wrong, the food is great, fresh and a great value on Wednesday's. However, don't get used to anyone worth a damn working there as ownership doesn't value their better employees, it's a revolving door. Yet another good one was let go this week. Owners seem to keep the people who don't care about you or value you. Time and time again, bartenders would rather text on their phone and sip their Starbucks then to get you another drink or ensure you are enjoying your time. The Friday live music is more like the worst Karaoke you could hear, especially with the blown speakers above the bar. Also it's time for the owners to fix the highway rest area bathroom stench they have next to the Sushi area and the men's bathrooms. Nothing like eating sushi when it smells like you are sitting on a toilet. Get my drift?"}
{"text":"Since we live very close we decided to come here before a movie and give it another chance. We had Emma as our server this time and she was kind, attentive and did a great job. My fiancé liked the sushi and I liked my spinach artichoke pizza. I am glad that this was a better experience because I like to frequent locally owned places especially when they are close to home!"}
{"text":"Good food and lots of happy hour style specials. Located conveniently across the street from Harkins Theatre in Arrowhead. This has become our go-to for movie night. We just get there a couple hours early, reserve our seat at the theatre, and enjoy some drinks and apps at Headquarters before the show. Works out great! Only complaint is that the TV/music can be a bit loud, but it fits the vibe and isn't too bad - especially if sitting outside."}
{"text":"We stopped in to grab a bite at midnight and we're glad we did. The staff was courteous and the management was just as welcoming. I had the ultimate braised pork nacho. It was FANTASTIC! The pork was delicious! I want to come back for a pulled pork sandwich after tasting it. I Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Great prices. Love the happy hour. Can't wait to try brunch this weekend."}
{"text":"I came in on Sunday and was there a good part of the day to watch football with friends. Like any other sports bar, it's better to have each TV show with a sign as to which game is going to be playing on that TV.  This is primarily for the benefit of the bar and the employees. Serving is a tough job, servers not only have to deal with multiple food/drink requests, they shouldn't have to worry about the science of picking which game needs to be displayed on what TV only to request it to be changed and another table get pissed off at that they changed the channel.
With that being said, with multiple requests I also feel it lead to the fact that it took 15+ minutes to finally get the drink I requested.  Now that was one factor, the other was watching the servers and how they were interacting with other people. Some were chit chatting it up with other coworkers for minutes on end. The biggest issue, the manager. He was more concerned with making sure all the single girls in the bar were happy with their beverages.  I know serving isn't the most fun job but it starts with a good manager and works itself down from there.  Make sure your employees are working, not socializing and get some signs on your TV's to display what games are playing on that TV and make no exceptions for channels to be changed.  P83 needs a good sports bar so I really hope this is taken into serious consideration."}
{"text":"Haven't had a bad time here ever.  The sushi is great!  Awesome TVs everywhere to watch the games you want."}
{"text":"This is our second time here. Need to make sure to go on Tuesday or Wednesday for deals. We went on a Thursday and for not much food and nothing spectacular (the spinach and artichoke dip was the best part and was $12). The cheesesteak needed seasoning on the meat, fries were soggy, 4 strips of fish, a hamburger, two cokes and a beer was $70 and we didn't have much for leftovers. Our first time there on a Tuesday night was so much better!  food was less expensive, and much more flavorful , and $2 beers. Will only go on those nights. Good service. But food was not worth the high price tag."}
{"text":"Come here 1-3 times a week and have gotten to know the owners and the staff. Food is good and Ray, the chef, will accomodate special needs. Lots of TVs for sports lovers. Unfortunately, the outdoor patio is sunny when we are there."}
{"text":"Jaden.. our server was attentive and took great care of us.. what a awesome place..great food and Adam the owner kept checking on us and was delightful!  The food was amazing!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I try a different place every Friday for our \"date night\" and alternate who gets to choose. This was my idea and it was a great one. This place is modern, open and clean inside with more TV's than a Best Buy store. My fiance had the Philly cheese steak sandwich with fries and I had 'smoked salmon' sushi and the 'Sports lovers' sushi and it was delicious. This place has an actual sushi bar with chefs and they know what they are doing. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place was nothing out of the average. The food was ok, nothing remarkable. Maybe I just didn't order the right thing, but this place seemed to not have a centered focus. The menu offers up everything from sushi, to pasta, to burgers, to tacos and more. The ambiance is more of a Hooters vibe than an actual restaurant. Service was eh. They messed up our order first try. The best things here were the appetizers (stuffed jalapenos) and dessert (apple pie roll)."}
{"text":"We came here for the first time tonight. Friendly atmosphere, amazing food and happy hour menu was awesome! Our server was Nick, he was very friendly, answered all our questions about the menu, and told us about the awesome deals throughout the week. Very family oriented place, clean, not loud enough you can't talk to someone at your table. There was a live singer that so be on the voice. I highly recommend this place to anyone. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Wow. This is my favorite place to get a late bite to eat. Not only do they serve a full menu until 1 am, but they also have a phenomenal bar. I've certainly never found a drink from Headquarters to be weak! Amazing drinks, paired with convenient specials. 
The main reason I enjoy Headquarters so much is the staff. I am allergic to dairy, and I have become used to how I must order. The first time i visited, i did my normal routine of order it, and don't actually make it for me if it has dairy. My server made sure to check everything with the chef and owner, Adam, and it has been that way every time. Ive never been concerned about the server ignoring my request, as it seems at some restaurants as though they dont care. I finally have a restaurant where i can order off the menu without fear! My server this time was Amber, and although it was her first day she was extremely efficient and knowledgeable. She asked for help with my allergy, and Adam helped us, again. I have never seen an establishment with a staff at this level of commitment. I will definitely be returning the next time i need to get a late dinner!
P.S. Clearly, i had finished my drink by this time. My review is under the influence."}
{"text":"Please do something about the smell in the men's restroom... always smells like urine! Went to wash my hands and one soap dispenser is gone and the other is empty... this is an important issue. Please fix it"}
{"text":"Yummy food, nice clean place, timely service and the owner came out and said hello. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"We went out tonight looking for some good happy hour deals and came here. They have awesome food (headquarter grilled cheese - not on the menu- but totally worth it)!!! And the drinks are cold and strong - can you really ask for more!?! We have been here a time or two before and we had Sam who is amazing!! Tonight we had Nick and he was the bomb.com!! They are literally some of the best waiters around! Don't waste your time anywhere else in the area around - this is the place to be!!"}
{"text":"My mom went here for lunch yesterday and said the food was great, so I wanted to try it and came for lunch today. Sadly, I don't know how the food is because I left after waiting 20 minutes without anyone coming by my table. We were sat right by the hostess stand and were never even greeted by a server. Several employees walked by our table and the hostess watched us looking around to even get our drink order taken, and still didn't send a server our way. 

After 20 minutes we left to go to another restaurant down the street. I wish I had more to say since I had heard the food was good, and I always enjoy trying new  restaurants in the area....nothing I can do if they don't serve us."}
{"text":"Great food and outsranding service by Emily W. She was awesome. Very attentive, drinks we're always full... she was on it. Plus she's really pretty and has great eyelashes. LOL if you go in, ask for Emily."}
{"text":"Great hamburgers and great atmosphere. Very reasonable prices for alcohol. Waiter was very nice and did great recommendations."}
{"text":"I probably won't go back again, the rolls were ok but pretty pricey for the tiny size of the $15.99 specialty roll.  It was extremely loud, very sports barish for the location.  I went there for the sushi and the lobster that was on my roll was very skimpy all things considered."}
{"text":"I mean what can I say about Anthony; such great service! First off he greeted us in such a timely manner and to me as a frequent restaurant goer, is big! I hate being left unattended or unnoticed for more then a few mins, but he was right on his game. 

Food and drinks came out correct and quickly. This in fact was important to my bf and I as we were in a time crunch and in a hurry to make it to the movies across the street . PS that $2 beer special is off the chain ! 

We will deff be back for that and to see Anthony! Great place, great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Open atmostphere, great seating to see all the TVs that are showing practically all sporting events, great food, and great service. This was mine and my friends' first time here but we will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Awesome drinks, atmosphere, and fantastic sushi. Great place to watch the games and have a chill night with friends."}
{"text":"Walked in the door and immediately hit by stale beer smell throughout restaurant. It's just a dirty place, menus are sticky, beverage splatters on  booths. Atmosphere is drab and not welcoming. Sort of a dive bar place. Will not be back! Too many options for eating out. Can't even imagine what kitchen looks like. Eek!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant, good variety of good food and friendly staff.   Good atmosphere, sports bar with lots of tv's,  but not too loud or overbearing.   Decor is modern, lots of seating options, with a large patio  and counter seating.  There were families, groups of young to seniors all enjoying themselves.   

Menu has a something for everyone.  I'm not a sushi fan, but there were a lot of diners who obviously were, they have two sushi chefs preparing a lot of it.   We enjoyed our mango margaritas, Parmesan pretzels, fish n chips, chicken marinara.  Friendly service from hostess to our server Autum, she was great friendly, fast and welcoming.  We will be back.   Next time I will try their wings they smelled great."}
{"text":"I love the entire staff here. I had Sam this visit, who was helpful and advised that I try the salmon, a dish that I had never had before (best decision ever). The co-owner and his father are funny and kind. The menu has many tasty options at great prices, and doesn't leave the guest feeling overwhelmed. This restaurant strives to be what all restaurants should be (but aren't): a place that cares more about the people than the money."}
{"text":"Great menu options, but questionable food quality. My wife and I both got violently ill the last time we ate here. Not sure we're willing to give it another try."}
{"text":"Nice and fun atmosphere , crowd is diverse and friendly. Everyone seems to be vibing to the sounds of the DJ, as he spins the sounds during half time of the games playing on the screens. The DJ also announces various food and drink specials that change, while he/she plays the beats.

The hostess was very nice and accommodating. The food was good, I enjoyed the Strawberry Cream Cheese French Toast, and my friend had the Captain Crunch coated Chicken and Waffles, both were very delicious. Prices are reasonable for the amount of food served. Oh yeah the Mimosas were also delish.

I will definitely return, to try the sushi. It is a great place to watch the games. I would recommend to family and friends."}
{"text":"This looks like a new hybrid Sushi all around burgers and hot dogs kind of place. Walking in, it reminds me of a large bar, complete with DJ type music, a nice open bar with an outdoor patio and misters, and a pretty cool vibe. Lots of TV screens that are playing sports. I came here mostly to eat sushi and all the other sushi restaurants are closed so in a way that's a plus, but stay tuned because truly the sushi that I ordered (an eel roll and a yellowtail roll) was not that great. I found the eel roll cold (most times it's served warm) and the yellowtail roll was pretty small although there was a good amount of yellowtail in it. This would be a late night sushi place option, but not really one you would prefer over your favorite spots that close early if you had your choice. The service was just okay, not great but not bad, the girl did try to be friendly so it was okay. I think the big plus for these guys is that they are open till 2 a.m. midweek, which is Stellar because if a movie lets out late (right across the street) you could still spring for a good meal, and a brew or two. They do have a good draft menu of beers which is a huge plus including Kona my favorite.
I would like to come back to this place, and actually get some American food and see how that is before I truly give it a terrible review. One thing I did like was that they did have a sushi chef available, and she was familiar with Omakase. Tons of young people hanging out here though so that is the vibe more of a nightclub ish type Grill & Bar. I didn't mind it; the place is huge, it looks fantastic and I'm sure I will be back to give it a second review down the road."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Me and my wife had sushi Friday night with live music and it was great all around. Will be back next time I'm in Phoenix area."}
{"text":"5 min wait on a Saturday night during spring training due to HUGE location and great management.  We had the bacon wrapped jalapeño poppers, fried pickles which are brined on site, college street big blue van on draft with 30 other amazing beers.  Surprisingly their sushi is good.  Huge bar and huge patio. You can walk to spring training from here.  Owner of the place stopped by and asked what else he could do for us and every other table around us. They also MMAs on if you are into that.  Overall, we will be back!  Great service!"}
{"text":"My honey and I have been wanting to try this place.  We finally got there this past Saturday of Thanksgiving weekend.  We sat at the bar, and were greeted just about immediately by Andrew, the bartender.  He said if we don't see a drink we want on the menu, he would make us any variation, and according to him, he makes the best Bloody Mary, which I look forward to testing for myself.  He introduced his fellow 'tender, Melanie (90% sure..sorry if It's  wrong), who we asked to change a TV by us to hockey..a minute later the co-owner, Adam, greeted us happily, not only a hockey fan, but a fellow NY Rangers fan!  He told us about Tuesday night hockey game specials (awesome $2 ALL DRAUGHTS and appy specials!!)
We ordered pretzel and steak bite appetizers, and both were excellent!  
Adam's dad, Harvey, another NYR fan, came up and filled us in on some of the other menu items, like shrimp and calamari with a homemade sauce, mozzarella made in house and marinara made fresh from scratch. I hear the sushi is outstanding, too!  The menu is interesting and diverse.  It's a nice, spacious, welcoming space with TV's all over.  We can't wait to go back!  
HQ's is located across from the entrance to the movie theatre. 
I highly recommend this unique sports bar/restaurant!"}
{"text":"I really dig the idea of this place. It fits perfectly into my families wants as far as food goes. The prices are a little bit much if you ask me. So this is not a place we can frequent as often as we would like to.  But the idea of a sports bar with sushi and American Classics with a twist is pretty freakin cool. 

Last Saturday was my second time here. Both times we were able to speak to one of the family members who owns the place. And the first time we talked to the Chef. They are very proud of their place and I love that. But be ready to be talked to. These guys are from Jersey and its obvious. We don't get enough of that in AZ so I find it refreshing. 

This place is filled with TV's, I am looking forward to going there and watching a game sometime. They have the whole open bar that opens up to the outside and the inside. I really love that. And lots of spacious seating all over. 

My family and I decided to share a few appetizers to start. We had the Crispy Pork Spring Rolls: Marinated ground pork, fresh garlic, carrots, cabbage, scallions. Served with sweet chili sauce. The ground beef was so flavorful that I could have eaten it with out the sauce, but I am a big fan of sweet chili sauce. The outside was perfectly crispy. Then we had Crispy Cheesesteak Dumplings: Shaved sirloin, sautéed onion, roasted peppers, three cheese blend. Served with Guinness cheese sauce. I was not the biggest fan of this one. It was very plain. But my husband seemed to like them. I will say that both of these fried items had a lot of grease that covered the bottom of both plates. I'm a fan of grease, but this could be unappealing to some. 

I decided to get the Taco's as my entrée (usually an appetizer.) Cilantro Lime Chicken - pico de gallo & spicy mayo.Korean Barbecue Beef - apple cucumber slaw, sweet & spicy lemon dressing. And the Slow Braised Pulled Pork - pico de gallo, salsa verde. My lease favorite was the Braised Pork. Didn't have a whole lot of taste and was a bit burnt. I really loved the Korean Beef taco. The coleslaw was nice and tangy and really complimented the pork. The chicken was very good as well. 

The boy's had the BBQ Burger with fries. They liked it very much. And they split The Tuna Pizza as well. Tuna Pizza Crispy tortilla: spicy tuna, avocado, tobiko, tempura crunch, spicy mayo, and eel sauce. I had a chance to try this and it was really something. I think this was the boy's favorite out of all the items we tried. Everything went so well together. Such a great idea. 

Before we left the staff showed us some of their daily speccails they were trying out and they seemed very appleaking. I remember the prices being just right. SO we will be keeping an eye out for those. We really loved the staff just about everything else about this place. We hope it keeps up in popularity and sticks around."}
{"text":"Ordered from Uber Eats. Only 3 miles away. 
Good enuf to entice us to try in person. 

Got pretzels with cheese for app, bread was bomb but cheese was thick and lumpy, prolly cause delivery. I'm sure glad I added a extra cheese. All they give you is. 2oz cup. For 3 breadsticks. 

Got the surf and turf roll but asked to use shrimp instead, exactly as I ordered. It was delicious. Not enuf soy sauce in the bag tho. Could use some more. 

Got the full rack of ribs which is supposed to be with French fries and apple slaw. 

It was a full rack when delivered. But had way to much sauce. I wiped a lot of it off before serving. The French fries where I eatable because they were so soggy (again, to be expected on a Togo order). And there was no slaw included. Annoying. Was really hoping to try it. 

All in all I ended up making a easy side salad to go with the meal as the slaw was not included. I warmed up the pretzels in the toaster oven as well as the ribs. 

I think the food would be better if at the restaurant but for a delivery order of something other then Chinese or Pizza, wasn't too shabby."}
{"text":"My sister and I were having a girls day went on a hike got our nails done and needed a place to eat we were feeling sushi and mozzarella sticks lol where else to find that but a sushi/bar and grill! It was lunch time so we expected it to be packed but it wasn't so we were seated and got our drink ordered in and waited for a little longer then we hoped to order but we got sushi burrito a few rolls and mozzarella medallions everything was so good we will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"Considering the location is near great competing restaurants this is probably the least meal satisfying in arrowhead. The sign outside says grill so one would assume along with their \"concept\" of sushi they would have Japanese grill items. Do not be fooled it is very misleading. I ordered fish and chips the fries were the best part of the meal. Fish seems under cooked and breading was not crisp. IDK about their other items, but fish and chips dish is maybe a 2. However restaurant is clean and modern."}
{"text":"Great place to go, weekends are super busy , but wait time wasn't too bad. Love the menu variety ..you can order a hamburger, chicken and sushi!!  Everything is fresh. We have talked to owners and they don't have a freezer so noting is frozen only fresh foods. That being a great thing it also leads to them running out of popular menu items running out quick!"}
{"text":"When you sit down at the bar in time to watch the big game and 40 minutes later nobody has asked you for your drink order or if you want to see a menu, it's probably not a good idea to never return. The worst part is that this is not even a busy night."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time tonight. Usually when I'm in this area I go to the moon, which I love but my friends and I decided to try something different tonight. We probably should have just gone to the moon. Service was pretty good at first but after our first round we pretty much got ignored. My two friends and I sat with empty glasses for 10 minutes until I got one of the bartenders attention. Then when we were ready for a third round it was like pulling teeth. While both the bartenders were on their phones, the owner, who was about a foot from us, was too busy talking to a busty blonde to notice we needed drinks. I knew he was the owner because he was bragging about he used to own a restaurant 10 minutes from New York before owning this one. Rubbed my friends and I the wrong way. Also one of the bartenders was eating chicken tenders while talking to a guest, then proceeded to put away glassware without washing her hands. Super gross and unprofessional. I bartend as well and that is a huge no no. I would have understood if they were busy but we were pr baby 3 out of 10 guests at the bar. Safe to say I don't think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"Love the food and drinks! Thank you Harvey for always coming by and talking to us. Calamri and Shrimp is amazing!!! Service is great. Tuesday night $2 draft beers."}
{"text":"This was our second time in,  the first being soon after they opened.  This is so much more than a sushi grill! I'm excited to say this might be the local hangout bar we've been looking for! The service was great and the food was spot on. They have a great selection of beers on tap,  and a huge menu,  from sushi to steak to burgers to ribs. We love the outside sitting area,  which is a perfect spot to people watch being right across from the movie theater. They had live music,  who was a fantastic acoustic singer,  not too loud, perfect background music.  Again,  I'm so excited to have a good selection of beer and food that is right up the road!  We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"The place definitely has more of a bar, hang out feel than a restaurant. I took my mom here for a quick lunch and we had the taco salad. The salad was great if you're not on a diet. The salad came with tortilla strips crisped to perfection. They have a sushi chef near the bar area so hopefully next time we will try that. The service here was great, we had prompt refills and were checked on often."}
{"text":"The food is here is pretty good. The drink prices are a pinch high but the atmosphere is quite nice & I like the owner here. He makes you feel like a friend but doesn't linger too long to disrupt conversation. I like how the bar faces the patio so you can see outside, especially on a nice day. I hate sitting at a bar that faces the wall. lol I like that they have cell phone chargers too!"}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST bar food I've ever had. I have been in the hospitality industry most of my adult life and have owner and operated several bars and nightclubs. I am not at all embarrassed to say this food blows away anything I've ever had or done. This establishment is really top notch from top to bottom. From the moment you walk in being greeted from one of the friendly hostesses, to the bartenders and serving staff. I haven't been to too many bars where the GM or Owner hits every table to make sure everything is up to customers satisfaction. If you're In The area and looking for a fun night out with amazing food and excellent beer selection, look no further. Headquarterz is 5 Star. Keep up the good work ."}
{"text":"We love HQ and order it a lot via uber eats.  We also go in but try to avoid happy hour, and game days because it is really really loud in there.  We are really glad they are doing well.  

We usually always get the same thing; burgers, spring rolls, salad, brussel sprouts.  Their burgers are really good and when you order them to be delivered they still taste fresh and yummy which is what I love.  We've never tried the sushi so we can't comment on that we have a favorite sushi place so when we want sushi we go there.  

We've always had really good service every time we've eaten there and never experienced what some other reviewers have with horrible wait times etc.  Our order has always been correct even on deliveries and we order from them a lot.  

We hope they continue to do well, it would be nice to keep that space occupied with a local owned business."}
{"text":"Ok so I am surprised. Sushi and American cuisine. Great food. Sports bar atmosphere.  A great compromise. I have no idea what the sushi is like, but the wings and fried pickles rocked. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place was not one of my favorite choices at first. I had a bad experience with them through Uber eats, but the owner really took care of us when he asked me to give this place another chance. Service was great and food was even better! Definitely looking to dine in again. Not through Uber eats though definitely a different experience from dining in"}
{"text":"Good food and drinks. Many specials during the week. All the sports and they will turn on the games you want to watch. Say hi to Harvey the owners dad. He travels through restaurant making sure everyone is being taken care of."}
{"text":"We recently went to Headquarters Grill Bar. We had never been and never heard of it. It was a great atmosphere with indoor and outdoor seating. The bar area was huge and there were multiple TVs on every wall. The food was decent and service was good. The menu had a wide range of food to choose from! We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Great drinks. Friendly service. The prices are amazing. The have great daily specials that I did not see online. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"A great place! I've been here a few times, and each time I've found something else on the menu I like. The service is great, and the owner came around to see if we enjoyed our food! I will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Do your self a favor and don't order the side of guacamole. You will go broke just from ordering a side of GUACAMOLE. They charge $5 for a bowl of guacamole who needs a whole bowl. I had to take the bus to work the next day because I couldn't afford gas I had to buy top ramen for dinner the next day cause that's all I could afford. BEWARE OF THE GUACAMOLE GREAT PEOPLE OF AMERICA YOU WILL GO BROKE. you can find me under the loop 101 asking for change holla at your boy."}
{"text":"The service and food have been goo the 3-4 times we have eaten lunch and dinner here. The shrimp and calamari appetizer is excellent! The burgers and sandwiches that I have tried have all been good.. the brownie with ice cream is good but it only comes with 1 scoop of ice cream not two which is not enough for that much brownie. My wife likes this dessert I personally wouldn't order it again"}
{"text":"So much to say about this place. We are definitely \"regulars\" for many reasons. First off, the food. Have not been disappointed with anything we've ordered. Some favorites being: wings with HQ sauce, fried pickles, customized sushi rolls we order, pizza, really everything! 

Second, the staff. The owner Adam is so wonderful. Always walking around to check in on tables and make sure everything is going well. We have had great servers too, one of our favorites being Canyon. He is so personable and quick to help us with anything we need. 

Third, the restaurant itself. This place is always clean and ready for customers. The tables are turned over fast for a quick transition for a new party. 

Overall, we love this place. Definitely a 5/5 for us! Love having our new fun place to eat!"}
{"text":"Absolutely our favorite go to for happy hour and sushi!! Great, friendly and welcoming staff!! Love Happy Harvey!! Great genuine guy that actually converses with the guests..:"}
{"text":"We loved the pizza! The people are friendly and the happy hour is great. This time of year the patio is perfect. They have big screen TVs everywhere. We can't wait to go back for a football game."}
{"text":"I only come here to order their chicken wings or pizza to go, i dont like eating here because its basically a trashy bar lmao. Not for family, but if u wanna get drunk w ur friends have fun

Though some of the servers are really nice"}
{"text":"$2 beer is why we've came here in the past. Sitting at the bar has always been fine but apparently if you sit in the back section of they will not take care of you. Wish I knew the name of our server with the dark hair but he actually never told us? Took over 10 minutes to receive our beers after asking another server if he could check. Upon the beers getting dropped off he said not one word or asked if we wanted to order anything. 15 minutes after never being approached again we walked out, just awful service probably won't be going back"}
{"text":"Last night was a perfect evening. WE, me and posse rolled in DEEP at the Harkins for the INCREDIBLE movie VIP screening for \"Hacksaw Ridge\"!! (Excellent, go see it and bring plenty of Kleenex!) For our post movie for food and foodies. We ended up convienentally across the street of Harkin's Theater to Headquarters. What a grand idea to dine at and to accommodate those who are sushi fans and non-sushi fans. Being it was a Wednesday night and we had not experienced HGBS, we were a bit clueless on what to expect other than food. However, we were stoked about the 50 flat screen TVs, our server Marisa and finding out EVERY Wednesday nights (starting at 6 p.m.) is HALF 1/2 OFF \"traditional sushi\" and other non-sushi items, including LISTEN up Burger fans - BURGERS!! Say what?! I went ahead an tested the waters with ordering a caterpillar and dragon roll. The rolls are above average in size, HUGE for that matter! \"Bigger is better\" right? I received my bill, sure enough the proof was IN-MY-FACE a grand total of under $12!!!!!!! Yes, that's right TWELVE dollars! My rolls were very yummy and you may find me as a regular on Wednesday nights fo sho! I foresee a near future West-Sider-Ride-or-Die UYE. 

Beautiful and comfortable dining inside or out, with their outdoor patio bar. Headquarters is a new business for approximately 3 months. Let's show them some love and have them continue successfully with their business. Cheers to Wednesday night specials!!!!!!!!!!! Is it Wednesday yet?!!!!!!!! :)"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised. The food was good and my server was outstanding. His name was Sam. Professional, courteous, and efficient. The patio is nice and comfortable. There is also outside bar seating too. Love that! The inside is very clean with hi-tech retro restrooms. Venue is spacious with lots of TV's for sports. Located by tons of other venues, Arrowhead Mall and across from Harkins Theatres. Reccomended. #vino2ultimate #vinosquared"}
{"text":"Holy crap this place is awesome! You are always taking a chance by trying a new restaurant and this place did not disappoint. We had the mac & cheese, the pulled pork nachos, and salmon and tuna rolls. I only wish my stomach was bigger. Everything was delicious. One of the owners Adam was talking to everyone. He was so polite and friendly, his dad Harvey was a hoot. We will DEFINITELY be back to try more food!!"}
{"text":"We needed a late night snack after the SDvSF Spring Training game.  I had a catapillar roll which was ok.  Something seemed dry.  My friend had the Tartar over pretzel.  Too much sauce, she said.  DJ was rocking it on a Thursday night!  Spin the wheel for drink specials."}
{"text":"So I usually don't post bad reviews but people need to know this. I drove 45 minutes to a place that I thought was going to be great, but in reality I waisted my time. Right when I walked in the hostess was very rude and not so welcoming. It smells like sewer in the whole restaurant. The food was very greasy and cold and very expensive for the quantity you receive. There were nats everywhere. I felt like I was eating at a dumpster lot to be honest. The manager didn't seem very professional he was taking shots at the bar and didn't really seem to care about his employees. The server we had was great he treated us very well. That's probably the only good thing that happened last night was our amazing server. Other then that you won't be seeing me or any of my friends and family there again. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Good food.  Different drink specials.  Service is overall good.  We were staying down the street and went for drinks two nights in a row.  Our server Mackenzie was a doll. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Found this place on a whim, thank goodness I did. The Red mule is a must and probably the best sushi roll I have ever had is the Sports lover. Give this place a try and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar on Saturday at lunchtime.   Ordered the HQ roll.  It was very good.  No complaints. This is a great after work bar and restaurant. They also support live music with a duo playing during the week.  Any venue that hires local musicians is ok in my book."}
{"text":"Came to Headquarters for the UFC fights and were blown away by how great this place is! Our server was Emily and she was truly awesome! Wonderful personality and there was never an empty glass on our table. I'd give Emily 10 stars! Strong drinks and GREAT food, from Burgers, Chicken, and Sushi, the entire night was top notch! The manager came over and hung out with us for a few to make sure all was well. And of course, we will be back! Love this place!"}
{"text":"I had just eaten for the second time only a few hours ago and it was enough for me to write a review. I went on a Tuesday night when they have a special on draft beers, $2 for a pint (of pretty much anything). Needless to say, I will be returning for every Tuesday that they have this special. 

One of the biggest reasons I'm writing this, however, is one of your servers, Chelsee. She not only performed her job incredibly, but she was social and engaging with me and my friend. I would recommend rewarding her in some way; she made our experience at headquarters even better. 10/10 would recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is best! Amazing service, staff, food, management... owners come and speak with you. A forever customer!"}
{"text":"Additional review: just tried the street tacos.

HOLY. HECK. THEY ARE DELICIOUS.

Now I'm going to have to decide between them and the sushi.

And let me tell you, I can't often eat pork; if it isn't done right, it turns my stomach.

I had zero problems with this. Delicious beyond belief."}
{"text":"Came here while on a business trip. Popped in on a Tuesday night. Had happy hour prices and even happier hour prices after 6pm. Their beers are only 2.00 on Tuesdays after 6pm. Hella good deal. Sat at the bar near the end where they make the sushi. I did not have sushi but after seeing the selection and them preparing it... I'm not sure I ever would. Fish look old, smelled old and I'm sure tasted old. Not sure when they get fresh fish deliveries but maybe wait for the weekend to try it. I had s margarita pizza. Took a while to come out but it was worth it. Tasty fresh tomatoes, mozzarella and basil. I will be back."}
{"text":"McKenzie was the best! Not to be a rude ass 30 something but for 19... we'll she was just so on it.. not just like quick service but fantastic personality as well... I loved her... Jayden came in at the end of our night to take care of us and he was so sweet and patient with me after I had a few. You don't find many places like this anymore! Service and food and drinks are quality as fuck"}
{"text":"Horrible horrible horrible! We have this restaurant 3 chances! 1 time: they forgot to order 3 of our sushi's. 2: they brought the food after 1 hour! It wasn't even busy. 3rd time: I ordered $130 worth of food thru Uber eats at 11 am for delivery at 8:00-8:30. I called the restaurant 3 times around 7 pm to make sure my food is ready on time. I had to call few more times around 8 pm and they kept saying it'll be ready in 5 minutes .. eventually it was ready at 8:30 and my food was delivered at  8:50 horrible service. Food is honestly good but come on. Time is of the essence. My biggest pet peave is when someone is late!!!! No excuses. I called way to many times and everything should've been ready on time!! Sorry but you lost a good client. We used to company biweekly too!!"}
{"text":"Had the barbecue bacon burger. Good but messy. Wife got the dragon rolls. Good but the portion seemed small for the price. Lots of tv's with games on. Has a nice outdoor seating area. Reasonable prices and friendly wait staff."}
{"text":"Had an amazing first time experience today at Headquarters! Food was AMAZING! Hot, fresh and delicious! Our service from Sam was outstanding, quick & attentive! Came here on a strong recommendation from one of the bartenders, Gavin! Enjoyed every second of it! Stop by for any occasion.. you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Only had the donuts, nachos, and sushi none if ehich were outstanding. Sushi didn't taste fresh, nachos were okay, but the owner had said they were so big there was no way we could eat them, they werent that big, about average and I cant tell you anything great about them, just chicken chips, salsa... i have had better and the donuts were so disappointing, a little greasy and not much flavor besides grease and blandness. Owner or manager came and talked to us, nice but a little  forced on the conversation."}
{"text":"Service was terrible waited at least 30 minutes for our water to be refilled not to mention the time it took to get food and drinks. It was freezing inside. Server passed by our table serval times before checking on us. Ordered a chicken sandwich and it was burnt, the chicken was black, had to send it back only to wait 30 more minutes for the server to check on us and for me to ask them to just cancel, the rest of the table finished  there food. The server was so generous and offered to wrap it if it was done by the time we left and not charge me for it. The service was aweful the others at the table enjoyed their meals but felt guilty the whole time. This place had a drunk-ish feel to it ,if you wanna find a place to get drunk off gummy bear shots while watching the game this is the place for you."}
{"text":"The service and the wings were their saving grace.

The hostess was completely rude. Attitude from the time we walked in to the time she sat us. We first told her we were going to sit at the bar and she wish us luck finding a seat. We told her we were going to look and see if there was something available. When we went back to her to let her know we would just like a table and she showed us to an open table and before we could sit down she wanted to be sure to lecture us about how we should make a reservation. Really!? It's a Tuesday night at 8:30pm. I'm not making a reservation and its also ok with us to wait a few minutes. 
On the other hand, Our server Justin was great! He did a great job and his recommendations were spot on. He told us his favorite wing sauce and recommended the pretzels appetizers. The pretzels were good! Cheese sauce was good. The wings were my absolute favorite! They were delicious. We got the HQ signature sauce. It was so good and the wings were so crispy!! Loved them!"}
{"text":"Always a great time. The father and the owner of the place is awesome stops by your table to say hi. Always had a great meal love their selection. So many things so many diverse things anybody would be happy to come here and eat dinner you can please everybody"}
{"text":"The food here is phenomenal, nothing like typical bar food at all! Everything is fresh and made from scratch! The atmosphere is excellent! Don't miss this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"I loved the food and the service was great! My only issue is that my drinks were watered down so I felt a little ripped off which is why I only gave 4 stars. Bar food and sushi is a really cool concept though (because sometimes you want a cheeseburger and a sushi roll) except no Las Vegas roll which was a little bit of a bummer but oh well. So just stick to wine and beer so that you know you're getting your money's worth in alcohol and you'll be fine!"}
{"text":"Best sports bar on the west side. Handled a bad situation very well and communicated"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff. Fish was good, ribs were great! Amazing daily specials. We will be back."}
{"text":"I've been here 4 times. I'll never return.

The servers act like customers are their enemy instead of the means to their own livelihood. 

The food is meh. Frozen pizza is better than what they call pizza at this place. 

I've never not had some issue with my check, either they don't honor happy hour prices or they overcharge me for something, there's always an issue. 

I'm 0-4 on good experiences here, and I don't expect a whole lot.

I hope you have better luck than I did. Seems like a local business, it'd be nice if something succeeds in this location."}
{"text":"Had dinner here Friday night. Food was excellent and the service was great. Building has an odd layout so if you sit in the back you feel alone. Also a pungent odor in the building almost like sewer. But otherwise the food was perfect and we had quick service and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Just want you to know, I'm a person of my word and I did go back. We actually use them more through Uber Eats than anything.  Love the variety. Something for everyone.  My favorite is the California Chicken Burger. Not always consistent when delivered but still love it."}
{"text":"This place was disappointing to say the least. I was craving late night sushi and settled for this location, but really what was I expecting from a sushi and grill place? 

The sushi is expensive. Plain rolls with just rice and fish were $8 a roll and specialty rolls were about $14 and up. While the sushi is edible, the tuna in my rainbow roll didn't taste so good or fresh. Also they didn't even season and make mayo crabmeat filling, they just inserted a stick of fake crabmeat inside the roll. I thought that was pretty lame. 
The only thing that was good was their spicy salmon roll, because at least that fish was fresh. 

Now if the sushi wasn't good, their grill items should make up for it right? I tried the Nachos which had brisket, jalapenos, salsa and cheese. While they did give a big portion,  I thought everything was tasteless and couldn't really taste the cheese.

Unless you're just looking for a late night place to listen to loud club music and drink alcohol, I'd say pass on this place."}
{"text":"TNT Roll was very good, tuna was fresh. Rolls were a little small. Side of asparagus was hot and not over cooked. I ordered delivery to our hotel and it came early with all the utensils. They also delivered it with low salt soy packets."}
{"text":"I've been coming here with coworkers for months now. Always great service and great food. 
The only complaint is the terrible live acoustic music on some nights (Fridays for some reason). Totally kills the vibe. It's been to the point where our large group has left to go elsewhere several times. We talked to management and they've said \"people come for the music.\" not receptive! Just go for happy hour during the week or after the live band on the weekends....much  better!"}
{"text":"I looooove their Sushi burritos. WHAT A CONCEPT! I recomend asking for the special mayo they have for sushi. Its SO good. If you like sushi, you will be hooked. 

Do Not order the Tuna Pizza. It is the tiniest little thing for $10... very disappointing. 

Service is mediocre, it always takes a long  time...

The do have a happy hour... $0.50 beer great deal."}
{"text":"We met the owners a few months back and automatically built a friendship. Every time we would come in they would always stop what they were doing and made sure to say HI. The customer service is excellent and the food is GREAT. I liked the atmosphere so much I decided to have my mom's 63rd Birthday there with will all the family. We had a party of 13, they take reservations and were able to seat us right away. Our waitress was Emily and she did an amazing job. We never had empty drinks, the orders were done in a timely manner, and everything ordered was correct. The appetizers to the main entree to desert everything was perfect. Thank you Emily and Staff for making my Mother's Birthday absolutely perfect."}
{"text":"Never in a million years would I peg a bar and grill like this as a sushi place. Situation:  my wife and I sat at the bar on a Friday afternoon (2:30pm) and had an awesome experience. Monique was our bartender.  She was very attentive, kind, and made us extremely welcome.  Atmosphere is good, music isn't blaring, the whole place is extremely clean.  The food....incredible food.  Smoked wings are insanely well made, the spinach artichoke dip is among the best I've ever had, and the sushi....oh man the sushi is amazing.  This will definitely be mine and my wife's new spot for sure.  The menu had a mix of anything and everything, and based on what we've had I'm willing to try it all!"}
{"text":"Last night was our first time here. We went to check out the sushi which did not disappoint! We usually trek to RA or Squidink but decided to try it here because it was close to home. The spider roll & P83 were delicious! We also got to test out the Jalepeno Poppers which are not on the menu, they should be! I'd like a lil more heat with them & maybe a dipping sauce of some sort but even without that they were still delish. Other items our table had: Buffalo Chicken Pizza, Chipotle Mac n Cheese, the Baked Brownie & Cookie Dough Cheesecake. The atmosphere is great (watched UFC fight) , server Justin was great & the owners came by to check in which you don't see anymore with other restaurants. We will definitely be heading back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on Friday night.  We ordered the cheesesteak dumplings off the happy hour menu and were surprised that there were only 3 small dumplings paired with watered down sauce. Why not up it to 4 dumplings so a couple can share? That's besides the fact that $2 per dumpling is just criminal. We also ordered the mushroom swiss truffle burger which was extremely bland, and the buttermilk chicken sandwich, which didn't have any of the homemade honey mustard noted on the menu. We didn't try any of the sushi because that also seemed overly expensive. Overall I am disappointed with the value and the food. Maybe it was an off day since there are lots of 5 star reviews, but I couldn't see myself returning here."}
{"text":"Food and service was excellent! The sushi roll was fresh and delicious. Mac & cheese some of the best I've had"}
{"text":"The happy hour is a pretty good deal. The stuff we had was delish.... everything was so yummy. Waiting for our brownie dessert now.... did I mention how Jaden is? A smart ass wise cracker that was on top of his game... made sure we were take care, shared future specials going on this week, and all with a pretty good sense of humor."}
{"text":"I recently took my family to Headquarters that were visiting us from Minnesota for the kids spring break before I had to drop them off at the airport. I had been here before and I loved it so I decided to take them here. Our server Hannah was absolutely wonderful! She was so friendly and helpful, always filling our drinks and checking on us. The food was perfect and the weather was perfect for us to sit on the patio. Before we left she told us to have a \"safe flight and a good day\" and I thought that was soooo sweet! We will be back based on our great customer service we received! (:"}
{"text":"Chelsea was great! We've been coming to this place for a year now and she is absolutely amazing! Never once had to repeat out order and she was very prompt! Can't say enough about the service!!!"}
{"text":"Very fun and friendly place with a great patio! Adam, one of the owners, made a point to stop and meet us. We will definitely go back soon."}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE EVER! Sat at the bar got one drink and was ignored by the staff. Bartender forgot to put food order in and I just sat there waiting forever. When the bartender finally realized she screwed up the food order was rushed and was horrible. So if you want bad service and crappie food this is the place"}
{"text":"Came here to try it out for my bday. Initially I was impressed with the layout and all the tvs. Then I proceeded to wait 15 minutes and no server came up... so I left. Everyone seemed clueless that I had just walked in and we passed by management and the hostess whom seated us."}
{"text":"Amazing variety for the whole family at reasonable prices. Highly recommend the Spinach Artichoke Dip...delicious!! 

We were hesitant to order Sushi since it had more of a Sports Bar feel to it. However we broke down and ordered sushi anyway and it was fantastic. They allow you to modify any order to your preference. We will be back for sure!!

It's also conveniently located across from Harkins Movie Theater. Perfect spot for a date or family night."}
{"text":"Had a disappointing dinner last night.
We some friends of Ours for Sushi lady night
Food was good 
Service was Slow
Our waters went dry several times
We we greeted by a gentleman that said His son ran the place 
He was a nice man 
Food good 
Service needs some work!
Hope to see faster service if we decide to return"}
{"text":"When we saw this place from the street & it advertised grill & sushi, I was sure it was trying too hard to appeal to a wide range of eaters. I was wrong. All the food we had was great. I'm a sushi snob, and their sashimi & rolls were both very fresh & delicious. The rolls had some creativity without being over the top. The service was great, although near the end of our visit we had a hard time finding her. Future tip: ask the table if they need anything almost as often at the end of their visit as in the beginning. Adam, the owner, was fantastic! He truly was interested in your feedback, your service & your overall experience. He even wanted to make sure you survived the previous visit from his father (a great east coast personality who reminded me of my kids' grandfather). One daughter had the burger-perfectly seasoned & cooked; other daughter had chicken strips (she always has chicken strips)-they were moist & flavorful! Can't wait to go back & try their desserts. We saw some pass by the table & they looked great. And Adam said they were made in house. The west side screams for places like this; keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Service is terrible.  Takes a long time to get recognized and an even longer time to get refills on drinks.  The owner needs to seriously coach his staff on routinely checking in on tables after they're sat.  Other than that, the sushi was great!  Decent prices too."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! We have been here quite a few times and each time was a great experience. From food to service, all 5 stars!

Our first time coming was Christmas Eve. My boyfriend isn't a sushi fan so I don't get it too often. When I found this place I saw \"grill & sushi\" - perfect!! Justin, our waiter, was great. He chatted with us the whole time, told us all the specials the restaurant offered and was very quick about everything. Each time after has been just as perfect. 

The food is superb. You can tell everything is fresh and homemade. Service is excellent as well. Everytime we go the owner comes and talks to us and makes us feel very welcome. We have told all of our friends and we try to get as many people to check it out as possible. 

Keep up the good work and we will see you tonight!"}
{"text":"Thumbs up! Great food and atmosphere. Something for everyone here! Enjoyed pork sliders, mac-n-cheese,spicy salmon roll, and especially grandma's hot mini donuts with Nutella inside. Upscale sports bar with dancing at night. Large varied menu. Should be a great place for Sunday football. They have a weekend brunch. On top of all that they have amazingly nice and attentive staff, family and owners. Family owned and operated. Thank you for such a pleasant experience"}
{"text":"WOW! Unbelievable, the best wings in town, seriously, and the ribs are awsome. The owner Adam came out and was really cool. So glad we found this place.. Everyone needs to try this place, can't be beat. And our server Canyon was perfect."}
{"text":"4.5 stars

Saw the reviews and became skeptical. Finally tried this place after a few months and was not disappointed. Food absolutely gets 5 stars. Service was a bit spotty and disorganized, but whatever. 

Got the boneless wings (REAL chicken, not processed meat) and pulled pork and fries. For a non BBQ place, the pulled pork was actually quite good. Fresh cut fries, everything was great. 

Ended up getting the cookie dough cheesecake for dessert, sadly not that great. Quite dry and the ice cream wasn't that great either. 

Kitchen is open till 1, and Tuesdays has $2 beers past 6pm with a great selection on tap! 

Check this place out!"}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite spot in the area.  I've tried probably half the menu and every item exceeded expectations.  They've got EVERY game on the tvs (all of probably 50 in the building) and have an amazing beer selection.  Half the time I stop in for a beer to watch the game and end up ordering three course meals.  The service here is always on point and the owner is a constant figure making sure everything about your visit is exactly beyond your expectations.  Personable staff and a very personable owner make for a great experience.  I cannot over recommend this place for any sports enthusiast.  They've got elevated bar foods, great beer, and lots and lots of sports."}
{"text":"Seemed like it had good reviews. Tried it out, the wings were okay, but seeing bad fish and the fact that I already ate a roll without really looking at it makes me feel sick.

The \"Chef\" was really upset I sent it back and I saw him arguing with the server and then came to me telling me \"how fresh their fish is\" and how many times their shipment comes in. Defended himself entirely, no apologies. 
Also terrible service, girl didn't smile or care and was gone for very long periods of time. 

My family most likely won't be coming again."}
{"text":"Great sushi and amazing lunch specials. We will definitely be back. Service was a little slow but it was a little after the lunch rush."}
{"text":"My new favorite place!!! I just moved within walking distance from here and I feel like I am going to be here every weekend. The food is delicious and the drinks are pretty great too! Staff is super fun and friendly, huge menu for everyone to enjoy, and a fun environment. The first weekend we came Melanie was our server and she was so so so sweet and attentive. She also seemed like she was enjoying her shift which is always good to see that your server is just as happy to be there as you are. Thats always a good sign  Cant wait to keep coming back- I'm hoping to catch their happy hour too!"}
{"text":"Me & all my friends come here several times a week. We spend quite some money here & I would say for a great reason. There has never been a time when any of us left unsatisfied. It tends to get busy which may cause a delay in getting your tab quickly but the food is fantastic, the drinks especially fish bowls are wonderful & the servers as well as managers are beyond great. I will keep coming back!! 10/10 would recommend this bar in a heartbeat!!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour and service. Will was awesome and very attentive! We love coming to Headquarters for all the great deals and food!"}
{"text":"Order delivery it took  over 1 hour to arrive. The food was cold. Don't order food from this place..."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this place out last night based on their reviews and man did they not disappoint. We came in during happy hour and we're seated immediately. They have great deals on drinks and food on Tuesday and wednesdays. Their food is EXCELLENT. We learned that everything is made in house. My husband had their sushi which he said was amazing and I had their classic burger which was superb. And don't even get me started on their apple pie roll dessert. Best thing I have had in a while. We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Idk if it was the disgusting sewer smell or the food that was so bad. The smell was horrendous that when we got our water with lemon we used the lemon to put under our noses. Our food ... another disappointing factor of our night... we got the fish sandwich and the taste was poor and the breading was just mushy and falling off. We also got two orders of sushi. Shrimp tempura and a spider roll. I understand that fish is fish but I've never ate sushi that tasted & smelled so \"fishy\". The spider roll was so wet around the seaweed and sticky. That was the first bite I took, then I went to try the shrimp tempura and pulled out the long piece yah know that comes on the two end pieces and about threw up. Stopped eating it at that point. So sad that I spent 46$ on an experience I wish I never had because my first time is my absolute last time I will ever be in that place! I didn't even want talk to the manager I just wanted to get the eff up out of there. Also I never review it just shows how bad it was."}
{"text":"Good food and lots of TV's for the games.  Beer specials are going on most of the time.  Good spot to chill for some drinks and food on the weekends."}
{"text":"So disappointed! We ordered $75 worth of food! 3 salads.. edamame... sushi.  Salads where supposed to be with chicken.... instead we received shrimp! Our salads were supposed to be with mango ,cucumber roasted nuts and apples ect!  Nothing but lettuce with sliced cucumber ! This was a somewhat celebration and I decided to splurge! It was nothin more than disappointment! In fact we argued instead of celebrating........"}
{"text":"Went late one night with a friend. Got a blue moon and some fried pickles because I'm a sucker for some good fried pickles. They didn't disappoint. Perfectly fried and just the right amount. The blue moon was reasonably priced and as someone who isn't a beer drinker, I had the perfect amount with the short glass. Music was a little loud but it was that time of night, I didn't really expect anything different. Will definitely be frequenting this place for my late night hang outs."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic, staff was friendly, they have plenty of TV to watch the game. New favorite spot to grab a beer and burger and watch a game. Highly recommended to give it a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love coming here!! Adam and his father never fail to make you feel like family or long time friends!  Food is alway amazing!!  The tuna pizza is delicious along with breakfast pizza...hell everything is great!!  The mango margarita is hands down the best!!  Not overly sweet where you still get that tequila taste!!!"}
{"text":"Service was great! Staff was super friendly and really accommodating. Even when I ordered the wrong roll they were totally fine with giving me exactly what I wanted. I'll definitely recommend it and be back!"}
{"text":"You should try 10-plus choices of shushi's at this recently-open restaurant. I can assure you that you would never find any so beautifully decorated and delicious taste elsewhere in Phoenix areas. Deserved to get my first 5-star rating.  Affordable prices !

Final notes, its owner and waiters have been very friendly !"}
{"text":"Walked in, the place smelled like a damp bathroom. We grabbed a table anyway, waited 20 mins for a beer and for the game to be on the TV. Pizza was bad, pizza wasn't melted and everything was pretty bland. Waited another 20 to 30 for our bill. Used to come to this place regularly a few months ago and I think it's under new management. Not good."}
{"text":"Unfortunately tonight gets 1 Star! We went to HQ to specifically celebrate one of our friends leaving for the summer and ...my drink was terrible -how do you ruin a margarita? 
The. We waited for almost an hour to get our food-we were told it was because of people being trained! I get that people need training but it doesn't make sense when everyone else around you is getting their food?
We finally had to get it to go so that our friend could get out to the next \"thing\" before leaving! 
We TRIED to eat our food at the house but the winds I ordered were so incredibly dry and the onion rings were so incredibly not done-it was like tasting batter!
Arg-this was terrible


Sas thing is that I called back after this was posted and left a message..never a response"}
{"text":"Great fishbowl Margarita! You'll instantly feel a buzz with ur significant other that ur sharing with in my case my wifey! And then the appetizer was a half mix of boneless hq sauce a must have and the buffalo hot were amazing!"}
{"text":"So thankful for finding a place nearby my home that will serve food late night!! Great food, great service, and great drinks!"}
{"text":"Love this place  family oriented and every holiday they do something nice for their guests I on x mas they have the kids free food and meals !!!!Well I have to say sushi burrito awsome happy hour was great price I could do without the upcharge on side sauce for my rolls but what's 25 cents if the food is worth it! I eat here at least one time a week far from trashy... just cause it's not cheap for sushi lol cheap sushi equals food poisoning. No thank you I'll pay for the quality here and be safe haven't gotten sick yet except the day I ate across the way at the modern round ugh never again will I roll the whole parking lot straight to headquarters from now on !"}
{"text":"Very great concept with great food and good people and just a super great time. I enjoy the atmosphere. It's for families- it's for a date night- quick bites before the movie- or just anytime you wanna spend some time with great people!!"}
{"text":"Their prices are high for the quality of food. Service is poor as far as being waited on. It wasn't even busy inside and still seemed to take longer than normal to order/receive food/get refills/get your check/etc. The sushi was warm and wayyyy over priced. The Caesar salad was not good, at all. Maybe for a bar it would be up to par if you're drinking and not there for the food, but based on the prices of the food, you'd think it would be quality and actually taste good. Given that there are so many other places in this area to choose from, save yourself the time and money, try another restaurant/bar close by."}
{"text":"I've never walked out of a restaurant before we even sat down because the entire place smelled like someone took a dump in a steamy hot shower. In the middle of the restaurant. Thanks for being a first for me."}
{"text":"Been here many times and liked it a lot, but the last time I came could have been my last. The bathrooms are super gross! Ever since they opened they have smelt like the sewer line is backed up and the smell drifts into the restaurant. When they first opened I figured they would work on it, but it's been around a year and it is still an ongoing issue. When I went to the bathroom I thought I saw a roach, but it was actually a big clump of hair at the door. The floor of the bathroom had trash on it and didn't look like it had been mopped in a long time and the bathrooms didn't have toilet paper. Seeing such a dirty bathroom on top of the stench it made me think the rest of the place is dirty too. Will not be back for a long time. Hopefully they get the smell taken care of soon."}
{"text":"Sat on the patio for half hour with three waiters walking by us and were never helped. Only helpful thing was the hostess who brought us out some waters. Can't even review the food because no one bothered to take our order."}
{"text":"Our server Payton Trusela was amazing! Super accommodating and went out of the way to answer our questions and check 
 back regularly. Not to mention how pretty she is! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"We got above excellent service by our waitress Brianna. Not only was she knowledgeable of suggestions on the popular menu items, but she is very personable and relatable. Being Japanese we were skeptical on getting sushi from a sports bar, Brianna offered to personally pay for it if we were not satisfied. Boy were we pleasantly surprised with not only the sushi but also everything else we had ordered! The brussels sprouts and tacos were delicious but you can't leave the restaurant without trying the shrimp and calamari appetizer. 

We were impressed by Adam, the owner, when he came by our table and introduced himself, friendly and respectful. He told us everything on the menu is made fresh, and nothing is frozen.. which you can definitely taste in the meals. The quality of the food plus the sports bar atmosphere is unbeatable. Will definitely be coming back here when back in the area!"}
{"text":"This place is soo good!! The edamame are delicious! Get the spicy edamame you won't regret it. Good selection of beers and drinks. Good Desserts as well.. Affordable and fun place to hangout with friends. Come by you will love it!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It is a fantastic place to watch sports.  They have a TV in the bathroom so you won't miss a minute of the action which I Iove. They also have wonderful sushi! Being from Seattle I'm a little bit of a sushi snob but this place fulfilled my lofty expectations! All the food is fresh. Their hot wings were also delicious, and they let you choose any of their recipes if you order them off  of the happy hour menu. The HQ signature recipe  was my favorite.  Great beer selection, and the staff are pleasant and will even stop by for a chat every once in a while. Don't pass up the dessert menu,  words can't describe the apple pie sushi roll. Just try it and be amazed.  Definitely worth a visit (or a few) of you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Had a great time on a Monday night out. Fresh sushi and a nice happy hour. Looking forward to coming back for some of the daily specials, including Wednesdays where special meals are half price."}
{"text":"Service toke too long when the place was empty. The food was way too salty. Sorry but I won't go back. It's sad because the location is awesome, right across from the movie theater."}
{"text":"I love this place great food and great service by our server Rebecca!!!! She has great energy and knows the menu from the back of her hand . Thank you can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"We came for Happy Hour...everything we had was very good.  we had an eclectic dinner, wings; sushi & pizza and dessert!  We cannot wait to return."}
{"text":"It's okay. It's a pricey. It has a great atmosphere. The food is pretty good depending on what you get. They want this place to be a night club after 9:00 but it's not. They turn the music up so loud you can't hear the people at your table. Oh, and the owner's dad walks around and makes you feel uncomfortable. I think it would be better if the creepy dad wasn't always around talking your ear off. I hope this place figures out exactly what type of place it wants to be."}
{"text":"decent staff and service.
The place is very bright inside and does not have a very relaxing feeling. The bright fluorescent lights make feel like im a doctors office."}
{"text":"This is a hit or miss. Our service there was a bad experience. We were seated and given menus but, nobody offered assistance for 20 mins. The table next to us had gotten up due to frustration of the same ordeal. Eventually, we physically tapped a waitress on the shoulder to ask who are waitress may be. The customer service there was virtually non existent."}
{"text":"This place was really good.  Interesting and varied food choices.  The service was super....especially Rebecca, she went above and beyond to make sure we felt welcome.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Checked this place out yesterday for the first time and really enjoyed the food and service. Are server was awesome & super attentive! We order Sushi, Wings, Sliders, fries, onion rings & mac and cheese sticks... sushi was great for basic traditional rolls especially for happy hour that was a huge plus, wings were off the hook! Sliders were awesome the only thing we didn't like were the mac and cheese sticks, too oily and had a really weird aftertaste & wayyy too cheesy, if the cheese was more creamy I probably could deal with it im a huge cheese guy but it was like just this huge gunk of oily cheddar. Other than that its probably one of my new favorite spots!"}
{"text":"We were at a birthday party nearby and wanted to grab something besides the pizza being offered. A friend and I decided this sounded like an interesting concept so we loaded up the kids and headed over. The nachos we got for an appetizer were delicious and she and I both ordered specialty sushi rolls. I thought mine was really tasty and I believe she enjoyed hers as well. The husbands found the wings to be okay and the beer selection was good. My one complaint was the lack of a changing table in the restroom. Not sure if it's because this is a bar vibe or what but there were other parties there with children as well. Had to make the trek out to the car to deal with a messy situation. Enjoyed the food, would probably stop by if we were in the area again, but probably not a place we'd go out of our way to visit."}
{"text":"We've been here many times. This time, we came here for dinner for their Wednesday 50% off specials. I had the steak taco salad and my wife had the crispy chicken salad. The steak was cooked perfectly and the salad was amazing. My wife said the same thing about her salad. The service was excellent as always and we had a few leftovers."}
{"text":"This is the kind of place we NEED in the Peoria Entertainment District!!!  Not another big franchise, this eclectic spot is attractive, clean, has great customer service. Two brothers run the place and Dad volunteers to walk around making small talk and assuring the customers are taken care of. We snow-bird from the Pac NW so we get real cravings for sushi and seafood when here. The menu has a large variety of fresh, delicious food. Located in the perfect spot for a movie/dinner date---TRY IT"}
{"text":"Love trying new places, so we hit up Headquarters for Happy Hour been open week and half.  
Location;  Perfect location in the Arrowhead area,  its not on Bell with the crazy traffic so easy to get to and park.
Restaurant;  Very cute inside, it appears Sport but not sports bar like Trendy/Sport decor.
Food;  Daughter and I split the Hummus and Pita,  Pita was fresh and warm, Hummus was refreshing and yummy.  Also split the Cheese pizza, it was actually delicious.  I don't usually comment much on pizza but the cheese was perfect blend; spices were on point and crust was not too much.  Sometimes less is better especially with the crust, no need to get all crazy.  
Price;  Happy Hour price was very reasonably for quality of food.
Service;  We got sat the Server was immediately helping us, she was so friendly and never let us wait on refills and such.  By far the best experience was the Owner and his Father,  it was so wonderful and this is why I always will go to small business. The Father first approached and greeted us, he went over menu and if we needed anything.  The owner was not far beyond; thanked us for coming in and chatted with us for while.  Great place, give it a try."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite sports bar, food and the service are wonderful. The owners are on top of things. If you have a problem, they will fix it ASAP. It's a bit loud, but what do you expect from a Sports Bar. I would highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Love this place!! My new go-to bar for food, drinks and happy hour. Love going on Tuesday nights for food specials and $2 draft beers- they have a great selection. All the food is amazing- I would recommend the sushi , wings, tacos, and calimari!! 

Often have the server Sam and he is legit!! He knows me now and gives excellent service- above and beyond type service. 

This is a great place and bar for the West Valley."}
{"text":"Fist time to this place and we will 100% be back! Amazing food and waitstaff. The owner came by to check on us and made sure we knew about all of the specials they offer. Our waiter overheard us talking about our children and made sure we knew about an upcoming family night. A perfect date night spot but also very family friendly. Love that the only frozen food they carry is the ice and ice cream!"}
{"text":"Great bartenders, great service! The Chef is personable and caring! All of the staff are A++"}
{"text":"Patio? Great. In house musician? Great. Server? Awesome. Food - meh at best. (See below for update). Even though we only went for snacky stuff - mango jalapeño wings sounded great but weren't. Chicken tenders spent about 20 minutes too long in the dryer. Fried pickles flavorless. But they have Big Blue Van, which is a major plus.

UPDATE: Adam, one of the owners, came out to the table and was intent on making things right, which is tremendous. Appreciated the effort more than I can say. He brought out mozzarella medallions - very good, very creamy - and wings in sweet chili aioli sauce, which were far superior to the mango. Adam says that sauce comes with a shrimp and calamari dish, which is happening next trip. And thanks to his courtesy, concern and effort there will be a next trip."}
{"text":"I have NO idea how this place does it, but they manage to have ALL your favorite networks for games, a TON of great draft brews, a variety of great food, great music, and great service. Definitely a favorite of mine!"}
{"text":"Loved our visit here! We came on the 4th of July and despite being busy, we still had great, quick service! Happy hour food, drinks and prices were awesome! Loved everything we tried and the service we got! We'll be back over and over again! Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"The hostess was nice greeted us immediately. We sat at the bar, and we were instantly greeted by the bartender. We were undecided on drinks, but she advices about the fishbowls and we opted for the HQ fishbowl, which was delicious! ONLY recommendation if you get the HQ fishbowl, have them give u the blueberry redbull, tastes sooo much better! Definitely coming back, already scheduling a double date with my BFF and her hubby!!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, very accommodating and friendly staff. Wide variety on the menu. Something for everyone. Would come back again and again."}
{"text":"We ordered a chicken cheesesteak sandwich and requested the bread be toasted. It wasn't. The pretzel bits were very doughy and the apple mango salad didn't have many mangos. 
The taste was ok. 
I ended up ordering the sushi. The California roll was good. Nothing outstanding. The Arizona roll was good too. 
We might try it again, but it was a bit expensive for an ok experience."}
{"text":"50 cent beers and six dollar sushi. Lots of tv's to watch baseball games. The crowd wasn't the best and place felt a little like a dive bar but it was still decent, except for the older lady dancing and laying across the outside bar. Might think about going back."}
{"text":"best happy hour for sure in the west valley and awrsome creative drinks that they have and bomb wings got the crispy wings with dat sauce you know dat sauce but had a good time watching the game here and drinking and eating very enjoyable and great atmosphere couldnt ask for more best thing to come in this area for a while happy right across the street of harkins and they got great parking like great parking so you can park wherever you want and get the food enjoy it then head home for a relaxing nap good food again awesome"}
{"text":"This was some of the most mediocre sushi I've ever had - super basic rolls that weren't very good. I had a mango margarita that was too sugary. Our server kept us waiting all night and was basically MIA - I am baffled as to why this place has such good ratings. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Once again I had a great time and dinner this time, I stayed and ate in.. With Paul at the helm and Emily making sure I was taken cared of.. it was a good night."}
