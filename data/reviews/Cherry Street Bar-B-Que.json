{"text":"This is a great place to enjoy BBQ and some sun. I saw this spot which is off the beaten path while riding a bike. It looked pretty cool so I went back for lunch. They have a really nice patio to enjoy the weather in the summer. The pulled pork sandwich blew me away. It's a little pricy but I will definitely return."}
{"text":"We had tickets for the Cirque show across the street and arrived early so we decided to come in here for a drink first.  After entering the building we decided to get some food too because it smelled so good.  We had the turkey sandwich, sausage, home fries and mac & cheese.  Everything was great.  We enjoyed it so much we tried to go after the show however it was too busy."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. We reserved a section of the restaurant for a work party.  The brisket though, life altering (no, seriously). The owner is awesome and the staff were very attentive. It was packed and we still had excellent service. I've already recommended this place to all my friends."}
{"text":"The half rack was pretty good, it was a little dry, was hoping it would fall off the bone and be more saucy but still pretty good & lots of meat to it. The beef brisket was delicious! So tender and chewy, would order it again. The pulled pork was alright & served cold, wouldn't recommend it.   For the sides I recommend the home fries & broccoli/quinoa salad. Those 2 were delicious!!! The mac & cheese was mediocre, wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"So...this was our only choice for dinner before watching cirque du soleil. Walking into the restaurant, we knew it was going to be GREAT food! Cozy, warm environment and great service. We ordered the pulled pork sandwich, beef brisket, BBQ beans, mac n cheese, and of course, beer. My wife is not a big meat eater, but exclaimed to one of the owners, Lawrence, that it was the best f'ing pulled pork sandwich she had ever had! Not dripping too much sauce, just perfect seasoning. My brisket was amazing! The rub they put on it gave such a  delicious and flavourful crust on the outside, I would've been fine eating just the fat. The BBQ beans and Mac n cheese were phenomenal. We cannot wait to introduce our kids and friends to this gem!!!"}
{"text":"Been here twice, I've had better brisket and bbq chicken, pricey for such small portions"}
{"text":"Great patio, drink selection and great brisket. Perfect summer night casual outing.   Very close to the Docks volleyball courts and street parking nearby."}
{"text":"Was really excited to try this place out after reading the good reviews, but I found the experience very underwhelming. The food is mediocre and I've had much better BBQ in Ontario. We had the brisket and ribs -- while the portions were pretty big, both were disappointingly dry and we were able to finish only because we washed it down with beer (even then it felt dry). There was only 1 kind of BBQ sauce at the tables and it wasn't anything extraordinary. The sides we got were also pretty average -- neither the coleslaw or the mac 'n cheese stood out and I could've made better at home.  I expected much more from the Yelp reviews. It's not terrible, but it's very mediocre and there are much better options out there."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because what's better than a pile of delicious looking meat other than a bigger pile of delicious looking meat. But if I have to be truthfully honest, it wasn't the best BBQ I've had nor the best Toronto has to offer.   Don't get me wrong, the spices on the brisket and the marinade glaze on the pork back ribs were fantastic but that was about it. The pork back ribs were rather bland pass the glaze and half the brisket was dry to the point it was inedible. But those aside, the fact that neither the brisket nor the ribs came hot (it was barely warm) had me a bit upset.   I may come back to try the burger and sides, but unfortunately Cherry Street bar-b-que is not at the top of my list for BBQ after this visit."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner after a long day. We sat in the patio. We ordered a bit of everything (sausage, chicken, braised beef, sandwiches (pulled pork, braised beef, Philly cheese sandwich,), and sides (beans, Cole slaw, creamy broccoli and quinoa, Mac and cheese). The meat were all excellent...along with the sandwiches. My two boys (4 years old) and my niece and nephew (15 and 13 years old) loved the Mac and cheese. The sides were alright. The staff were friendly and the food came quickly...we were starving after a long day at Centre Island. Overall, I would definitely come back for the BBQ meat."}
{"text":"Read the review in NOW, and since we are downtown condo foodie hipsters, we figured it was our duty as bbq meat lovers to investigate. We walked there mid Sunday afternoon and ordered up. Took a table on the patio, got a couple of drinks from the lovely bar chick and licked our chops in anticipation.  Two sips later and only a song from the very into it DJ, our brisket and two sides were delivered. First the sides - potato salad, lighter and fresh with chives, oil and a hint of balsamic is what we tasted. Mac and cheese done without complication - don't fix what's not broken! Both very above par and a portion that was neither too little or too much. No leftovers here.   The brisket.  Jesus.  I cut it with a plastic fork. It was delicious.  Salt and peppery crust is addictive. I even ate the fatty bit.   We watched a lot of dishes go to their respective tables and saw some sandwiches that I'm not sure I could have finished!    If first impressions are important,  we will be back and probably later this week!  Oh did I mention the 5 buck draughts? Very nice touch. This place is going to eat into some other bbq places profits!  Gets a 4 star because we want to be wowed again!"}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday evening when it was still warm enough to sit outside on the patio. Ordered the brisket, ribs and mac & cheese / broccoli quinoa salad as sides. The brisket was our favourite - it was sooo tender, - along with the Caesar at the bar.   Overall the weather and atmosphere (live music playing) probably contributed a lot to my positive impression of the place but it really is just a pub style restaurant with good barbeque. It's a little bit out of the way, so would recommend visiting when you happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our Brisket Sandwich and the Cherry Cheesesteak.  Brisket was tender and fatty with lots of flavour.  The Cheesesteak was also a winner with messy cheese sauce and all the fixings.     We orderes a few sides and was very happy with the smoked beans.  The mac and cheese and didn't like the potatoes salad were boring in comparison."}
{"text":"Awesome place!!! Extremely recommended. Everybody is super friendly. Next time im in Toronto i will be coming here again!"}
{"text":"Start by saying that the atmosphere is great. Live music and DJ were on point and the staff was extremely friendly.  The food was just okay...was nothing jaw dropping but was not horrible either.  The patio was nice."}
{"text":"Absolutely surprised to see a 4 star average for this place.   With my love for BBQ and being the dead of winter, I decided to satisfy my hunger by ordering take out from here, one night while working. I felt like I wasted my money, I was utterly disappointed.   I ordered the half pound of brisket, with a side of Mac and Cheese, and was relatively shocked when I opened the container...  Knowing smoked meat, I set my eyes upon one hunk of brisked (not sliced) which I would estimate was no more than six ounces, and maybe twenty percent fat as well, served with a wad of uncooked yellow onion and two slices of what appeared to be Wonder bread. My mouth dropped in disbelief. Hardly how I would have expected, nor served myself if I was presenting this to a customer. Yes it had a nice smoked taste, hence the two star review, but I felt extremely shortchanged... And on top, no BBQ sauce, or butter or anything you may expect with brisket and bread.   The Mac and cheese, well, this was an additional waste of money, it seemed as though it was a cheesy cream sauce poured over the noodles, not baked or served how it would traditionally be expected at many BBQ joints.  Overall, it was not a satisfactory dining experience, I felt as though I had wasted 20$ on this meal, knowing there are many other BBQ places to sample in Toronto, this one will not be seeing my repeat business."}
{"text":"The pulled pork is delicious - great sauce, but it could use more of it. The mac n cheese has a nice zippy sauce, and my wife had one of the best caesars she's had at the bar. Well done."}
{"text":"Excellent, found it thru Yelp.  Impressed upon my first visit, so I brought my wife last week. The cherry mac double stack burger was fabulous!"}
{"text":"Great place if you feel like comfort food and some good meat!  Lively atmosphere, and helpful staff who tried to get us seated. Website states no reservations, but many tables were blocked off with reservations for parties. Staff member said they're trying to get that fixed. Beef ribs aren't always available, so call ahead. Ceasar drink is served with a chicken wing....so cool- and delicious!"}
{"text":"Nothing short of spectacular - a meat-lover's paradise with the best brisket in town and innovative cocktails with which to wash it all down. Love the vibe of the patio with a view that makes you feel like you are on vacation."}
{"text":"I came here with my volleyball team before our game at polson pier. Great group hangout spot with a cool format. You order food inside and take a number to your table. We sat on the patio which was very busy, had its own bar and a DJ. The food was really good, I had the brisket and broccoli as a side. Both were awesome. My only complaint is that they ran out of some items on the menu which we wanted to order, relatively early in the evening. That may in itself be an indication of how popular this place is but still - stock better!"}
{"text":"As much as I wanted this to be perfect , it wasn't . Placed an order for take out $85.00 when it was all said and done. Ordered the brisket macaroni salad , Cole slaw , chicken wings, half rack baby backs. Macaroni salad was bland I think it needed salt and too  al dente for me. The chicken wings were just too salty un eatable. The slaw was ok. The Ribs were .... not fresh . Folks this is the type of food you have eat fresh right out of the smoker , if not don't bother .The star was the brisket falling apart tender great flavour . The staff were really nice , the dude that took my order was very nice and pleasant , cute chick behind the bar. I think I would go back just for the brisket alone , way better than the the dried out one I received on  Roncasvale  ave which was dry and tiny."}
{"text":"So good! I came here around 6pm on a Friday and it wasn't too busy. We ordered the brisket, pulled pork, mac & cheese and potato salad. It was all great except the potato salad, which had too much vinegar or something. The brisket was so tender and moist. I don't think I've had better brisket. I loved how it was served with pickles and jalapeños too! Can't wait to go back during warmer weather."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and vibe but cold in the winter they dint seem to have heating. Delicious food especially the potatoes and beans. We ordered brisket, chicken(must try) and back ribs. I found the brisket too be very fatty but overall great food.  Drinks are on the pricey side"}
{"text":"UHHH-MAZING bbq!!! **drools**   I think I was rolling my eyes, dancing and \"mmmm\"ing the entire time I was eating! Honestly, SOOO GOOOD! Best bbq I've had in a really long time!   We were a group of 5 and wanted to eat everything so the lady working suggested we get a platter, best idea!! We were able to get a taste of all the items we wanted and it was just amazing (I think I already said that)!   The chicken was moist and perfectly seasoned! The ribs were saucy and fall off the bone good! The brisket had the perfect ratio of meat to fat and melted in your mouth! The Mac and cheese was cooked to aldente and smothered in their creamy cheese!  Ok... I'm just making myself hungry again! Go try it if you haven't already, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Wow. Amazing food. We came here right before Volta across the street and there was a line up the full length of the small restaurant. It moved so quickly and from the point of ordering had our food in 5 mins. The brisket is melt in your mouth good. The sausage was incredible -- I was scoffing at $6.50 per link pricing but it was well worth it. The beans were amazing too -- had little pieces of brisket (I think) in it. The potato salad was the only let down for us but not terrible .. just tasted like a lumpy mashed potato rather than a chunky salad which is how I like it -- so might just be a matter of preference. But regardless -- two thumbs way up!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ!  Period. Amazing flavor. We have tried the beef ribs, pork and chicken.  All are done perfectly.  They are tender and practically fall off the bone.  As one example of how much thought they put into the flavours, the baked beans are made with the drippings from the BBQ and the flavour is incredible.  They also have a nice bar and a great outdoor patio for the summer. Live music too. What else can you ask for?  Worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Food wise, this place is great.  We had a selection of meats, and we were a big fan of the sausage, brisket and ribs (the chicken was ok, but that's not their fault - it's rare that chicken is a revelation).  Great sides as well, with not-too-sweet beans, mayo-less coleslaw and a quinoa and broccoli salad for some roughage.    My only complaint is about their approach to service.  Waiting in line to order food and finding your own seat is fine for McDonald's, but seems a bit inhospitable when you're spending that much money.  Waiting to be served at the bar, then waiting for your drinks to be made was even worse (it took, no joke, 15 minutes).  We had one round, and didn't bother to get back up again for a second because it was kind of a pain.  A staff member came by and started talking to us about dessert, and we had a healthy debate about which option we'd choose (banana pudding was the clear winner in my books).  We settled on what we wanted, but was then politely informed that we had to go up to the counter to order.    Don't get me wrong, everyone was super nice and the food was really tasty.  My two cents is that our experience could have been greatly improved had they offered table service.  I would hesitate to go back for anything other than a super casual lunch as a result."}
{"text":"Cons: No table service   Pros: Summer patio is awesome when open, great music, the shots out of mason jars are really charming"}
{"text":"Of all the many good purveyors at Assembly Hall I had dinner at Cherry Street BBQ. The brisket sandwich was outrageously delicious - freshly sliced before my eyes and placed on a soft soft egg bun. You could see the juice dripping with each slice, and the accompanying spicy sauce had enough kick for me to enjoy the heat - powered by a touch of habaneros would be my guess -- but not so piquant the drown out the lush flavour of the BBQ. Things were in excellent balance. Do yourself a favour and order the side of beans, cooked overnight in the meat drippings. Looking forward to my next visit to this piece of BBQ heaven."}
{"text":"This place was on the radar for a while and given that I frequent T&T Supermarket nearby its an always on after thought after I get my har gow fix at their food court.  The line ups are always a good sign but I guess this might be due to a dearth of a BBQ spot in this neighborhood.  There were quite a few people sitting outside though there was no line up at the ordering counter. Hmm they could use an improvement here as someone would just pass by and say I would be with you in a min and just disappear. This went on for a bit till I got my order in. I stuck with the beef brisket (the beef rib wasn't available that day)  and ordered a side of mac & cheese on the side.  The order comes with a side of white bread and pickled items. Hmm I didn't enjoy the brisket as even though it was falling apart it was not seasoned to my liking. Maybe the sandwich would have fared better for this spot, I might come back here to try the beef rib otherwise 2.5 stars P.S. The washrooms are filthy."}
{"text":"At first I felt really guilty that I didn't love this place \"5 star\" amount, but some of the reviewers have only a few reviews, which always leaves me less likely to feel confident they are all legit...  We arrived on a Saturday at what we assumed would be an off hour, around 430 pm.  It was busy --- the inside was filled with men in their 30s (a bachelor party?) and the outdoor patio had two children's birthday parties going on (complete with birthday cakes from Loblaws).    There was about ten dudes in front of us (part of the bachelor party) and we lined up.  Line didn't move.  Waiting more.  Line didn't move.  What the hell was going?  I was getting frustrated.  We started to try and observe what was going on, since no one was telling us.  Everyone who was working at the time looked completely clueless and no one seemed to be in charge.  I had to walk up after 15 minutes to the front of the line and ask another CUSTOMER what was going on, because the staff had zero communication with everyone.  (their handheld credit card processing system was done).  At this point I was pissed.  They should have gone to everyone in the line after a few minutes, and told them what was happening, and if you had cash, you could go and pay instead of standing around like a dolt.  So frustrating.  When we finally got up to the front of the line, it was clear the staff working here is not fully trained to handle crisis - they were doe-eyed and not much else.  We saw a lot of orders sitting at the cashier not being picked up for 5, ten minutes, just sitting getting cold (what I didn't realize is that when you get your food it's cold anyway, that's why they don't care if they bring it out right away).  I went to the bar to order drinks while we waited for our order.  I ordered a root beer cherry bourbon drink and my boyfriend got a beer; after he received his beer, he went outside to get us seats.  I waited.  Waited some more (see a theme?) when the bartender said, \"There's no more root beer.\"  No solution, just - there you go.  Then he asked if I wanted to - you guessed it! - wait while he got more root beer.  I guess I did? but I didn't really.  Then I stood, ignored, for another ten minutes while he did who knows what, because he never smiled, never acknowledged me, besides a patronizing, \"Why don't you sit down to wait,\" while didn't tell me how long it would be, or I don't know - offer me a water while I stand there like a tool?  The customer service sucked.  I guess my face was supremely unhappy, because when I received my drink, a gentleman (who was wearing a shirt that said Lawrence), asked if everything was okay, and I said, \"Not really,\" and then let him know my experience thus far.  Meanwhile, the bartender was happily taking my money from me.  Luckily, Lawrence (who must be a manager?) caught him in the last and final bad customer service straw, and said the drinks were on the house.  Cool, because the food had been waiting for me for like 8 minutes outside now and it would have been nice to eat it, you know?  So, the food.  It was not hot (the mac and cheese was hot).  The brisket and the ribs were good, but I would have preferred them at least warm.  I liked the broccoli salad a lot.  The music was really loud, not sure if that's a pro or con, just saying if you don't like loud music (country) you won't like that.    Overall, as my boyfriend put it, it was nice that he comped our drinks but we would have rathered to pay for the drinks and had a good experience."}
{"text":"Got the 1/2 pound brisket for $16. Very soft and tender, but a bit pricey.  I'd come back to try the baby back ribs next time, but the price is a bit of a turn off for me ($25 for 1/2 rack).  Quality: 8/10. Service: 8/10. Value: 7/10. Overall: 7.5/10 (Not an average)."}
{"text":"The staff is friendly and knowledgable, the Mac & Cheese is yum and the BRISKET is delicious.   Seating is limited. I did not like the order at the counter style. For such a small place, with a very small menu, you'd think you could be served.   Overall, worth a try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Cherry Street Bar-B-Que only scored a 3 stars because for one big main reason: our food came just enough warm. By the time we were done with the first item, the rest was barely warm. Surely the flavour was good but to be honest, I was expecting something better when I compare this restaurant with other places I had the luck to visit south the border.  We had brisket, side ribs, baby back ribs (1/2 rack) and half a chicken. To drink we had bourbon and lemonade and (I believe) 3 speeds by Amsterdam brewery.  The brisket was really good while the ribs were just ok. Ribs, when are perfectly done, should come off the bone like butter. These, unfortunately, did not and by the time we started to bite into it, they were just slightly warm. The chicken tasted good but, being our third item to eat, it was totally cold by the time we got to it. The sides we had were the mac-n-cheese (o-k) and the coleslaw that was delicious, perfect to balance and settle down the ingestion of all the food.  Overall the restaurant offers a menu with a wide choice of different cuts that should satisfy even the most picky meat eater. They have 2 smoke pits at the back. The setup is cool and the bartender was both knowledgeable and friendly. The drinks we had were without a doubt, a good suggestion by the bartender.  Despite the Cherry Street Bar-B-Que is located in a beautiful and unique building, is a bit out of the way though and the parking may be... \"troublesome\".  I will give this restaurant another shot just because the vast majority of the reviews are very good."}
{"text":"Great brisket in Toronto and friendly staff. The only negative part would be there is only  one BBQ sauce option"}
{"text":"Abso-fucking-lutely awesome!  This is peak meat! I'm not a giant fan of the uber-carnivorous, but I like it whenever a chef's passion and dedication shines through. I wasn't expecting to get that feeling from bar-b-que meats, but here we are!  This place puts the art of smoking on a very different culinary tier.  Yes, the brisket is fatty,  so plan your week of meals accordingly.  But it's so incredibly flavoured and so, so succulent.  Yummmm.   Better still are the baked beans.  Again, I'm not really much of a baked bean fan.  But these are, by leaps and bounds, the best baked beans ever!  They are freaking awesome!  And you can get a bowl for $5 - which may be the cheapest meal you'll find in Chef's Assembly.    Thank you, chef, for your passion and your dedication!  It's delicious!"}
{"text":"Without a doubt, this is the dumbest set up for a restaurant I have ever seen. We tried to make reservations but we're told they don't accept reservations, so just show up and we will be fine. Not quite. After trying several times to outrun other people to tables being vacated, we finally got lucky. Only to be told that table was reserved????  Eating out shouldn't feel like the hunger games in trying to find a seat.   Stand in line to order food and a separate line for drinks. After 15 mins in line for a drink, our food was ready......one problem. Nowhere to eat it. When we finally found a spot it was cold.   Avoid like the plague."}
{"text":"Great BBQ in a somewhat remote location. Brisket was simply seasoned but delivered big on flavour. Lawrence is well respected for good reason. His BBQ is some of the best I've had in Canada. The prices are quite reasonable as well"}
{"text":"My friends and I have been on a long road trip that started in Chicago, drove through Michigan, went to Niagara Falls, and ended in Toronto. On our last night we just needed a nice place to eat and relax. Cherry Street was perfect!!! Three of us ordered the burger and the other ordered the brisket sandwich. The flavors and juiced were AMAZING!!!! The Mac & Cheese was incredible and the baked beans had brisket meat which made them unlike any other I've ever had. I highly recommend this place to anyone and everyone. I hope they open one in Miami soon. ::hint, hint:: Wynwood is a great location for your vibe!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is opposite to the Big Top for Cirque du Soleil.  Therefore, it's a convenient option for show-goers. It's a little hard to get to if you're not already in the area, however.  For all you TTC riders, I hope you will be able to board the 72 bus at Pape Station instead of finding the 72 bus stop around Harbourfront.  I was surprised at how far apart the bus stops were and how few people in that area could pinpoint the stop's location for me.   Ambiance-wise, you will enjoy this place if you are used to the loud, casual pub scene. The tables are placed close to one another, so you're sure to hear your neighbour's conversation and thus have problems hearing your own. I actually like the loud pub scene while having a few drinks, but my company didn't like struggling to hear our conversation.   Despite the positive Yelp reviews, I was sadly disappointed with the food.  Price-wise, I found the items to be on the more expensive side even though several Yelpers hailed the restaurant for its affordability. This opinion was mainly based on the fact that you have to pay separately for the sides, each of which cost anywhere between 5-7 dollars.  Also, the menus are handwritten on the walls, so I am sure the prices change depending on the market.   We ordered the brisket, mac and cheese, and the sausage in a bun. The mac and cheese was a clear winner for us that night. It was creamy and had a deep, rich flavour.  On the other hand, the brisket was unbearably dry.  They serve the brisket with two slices of white bread and a side of onions, pickles and pepper, but the brisket's dryness was emphasized when sandwiched between these ingredients. Lastly, the sausage in a bun could have been a winner if the sausage wasn't so salty. You know the Costco hot dogs? It was saltier than those!   Unfortunately, two hours after eating here, my company and I both got stomach aches. We didn't eat anything after leaving the restaurant, so we suspect that the restaurant did not prepare our food properly....  Overall, we will not be returning.  We will most likely opt to get our munchies fix at the nearby T&T Supermarket."}
{"text":"I can count on 2 fingers the amount of times I've been to Cherry and Commissioners in my life.  One of those fingers includes this review so no, this is definitely not an area I frequent often.  I have been to the Southernmost Point marker in Key West more than I've been over the bridge on Cherry Street in my life.  It was one of those days where I take the entire day off and spend it eating and drinking with a fellow Yelper and when the day ends at Cherry Street BBQ for the last meal of the day I can say that it was topped off properly.  We had a light late lunch That went well into the 3pm time of the afternoon.  Thankfully it was light and on the way down from Greenwood and Gerrard we hit up a 3 places to grab a drink along the way.  Cherry Street BBQ was going to be the last stop and everything leading up to it just complimented the meal even more but even without going to the other places this BBQ joint had it going on.  Did I know it even existed?  No, I did not.  If not for my friend that decided this was a place we were going to check out I would never have even known because as I said, I pretty much never go to this area of town, ever.  Stranger in a strange part of town I suppose.  It was like being a tourist for a day without having to travel.  This place that felt completely new to me was something I never knew of so it was going to be a complete surprise.  We ended up eating on the patio because the weather was nice.  You have to get in line and order inside and then  you get a number with a stand to take to your table where they will in turn bring out your order to you.    The menu on the wall gives quite a few options for straight up BBQ or some sandwich versions of meat between bread.  For the meat options (what we were interested in) it pretty much had all pricing in half pound increments.  Essentially you'd be paying by the half pound for say ribs (3 bones), brisket, sausage (which equates to a single sausage) or for the ribs they were also available in half and full racks.  There were 3 of us so I tried to order accordingly.  We decided upon a full pound of brisket, a half rack of ribs (6 bones), and a single sausage.  It seemed like an appropriate amount for 3 of us.  The platter came out and they included some sliced bread  (normal thickness, not Texas toast thick slices) and it all looked really good.    The sausage we simply cut up for sharing.  It seemed either very fatty or we weren't even sure if there was cheese inside it was hard to say.  The casing kept it together until we started to slice is up and it became somewhat crumbly.  The sausage I think was quite salty but I loved that about it.  My wife would have certainly found it far too salty for her liking but it was really flavorful and savory just eating it on its own.    The ribs were unlike any ribs I've had before.  The meat almost seemed as if it was cured because it had the look of dry ham but it almost looked like the color of bacon.  Those are two areas of the pig not necessarily related to ribs at all.  The ribs were dry and almost red in color but fully cooked.  The meat seemed to almost chip off but it still stuck to the bones.  The best description I can use to put into words is that ribs seemed to be \"candied cured\".  Not juicy, tasty but very different almost like jerky still on the bones... unusual but I liked them and ended up eating most of the ribs.  The brisket however was downright delectable.  The rub on it rubbed me the right way.  It had kick but it was full of flavor, not overly spicy (for me) but so juicy and tender I probably could have chipped away with it with a plastic spoon.  I mean this brisket was simply melt in your mouth goodness.  I have to say it's probably the best I've ever had in my memory because it was just so juicy.  I'm so used to getting dry, tough brisket that it has to be smothered in sauce to lubricate the meat but not this serving.  I was completely wowed by the brisket, the juiciness, the seasoning and the texture.    For the shared meal for 3 which was the pound of to die for last meal on the planet kind of brisket, savory sausage and candied cured type ribs it came out to a bit over 60 bucks plus tip.  The pricing seemed a bit high for the portions but the quality as far as I was concerned was above and beyond quite a few BBQ places I've been to in my life all over the place including the deep south.  The brisket easily won me over, that I have no doubt.  We had issues with our BBQ sauce dispenser which was being able to squirt out the sauce.  Something kept plugging it up.  There was only one variety of sauce available as opposed to the half dozen you may see in places in the south.   Cherry Street BBQ is a well kept secret because of its seclusion to the rest of the city being in such an inconspicuous place and because of that it's probably one of best kept secrets in town."}
{"text":"I've seen this place for a long time now and have never been until I finally took my girlfriend after a coworker told me to check it out.   The staff was really friendly and the atmosphere was cool. Personally I thought the layout was defiantly different but cool, you walk in and head up to the counter to place your order and you are given a number and you can go to take your seat and the food is brought to you.  I believe this building was an old fire hall back in the day, it was fairly small inside. I know they do have a patio but it was a bit chilly at the time.   I decided to go with the brisket sandwich and for my side I got the mac & cheese while my girlfriend got the ribs with home fries. I didn't try what my girlfriend ordered but it was appealing for sure! As for my sandwich it was extremely tasty and the mac & cheese didn't disappoint.   If you are ever down near the docks and in need of something to eat, check it out!"}
{"text":"Amazing bbq! This is located on cherry St, my friends and I came here for my low-key birthday dinner. The inside was already packed and so half of us decided to find a seat outside on the patio. We eventually found seats, but it's best to come early. The food we had were pretty much were everything on the menu - all the sides, the brisket, the burger, pulled pork, chicken and pork ribs. My absolute favourite would have to be the burger, and the brisket. I liked everything else too but those two mentioned were delicious! My least favourite though was the coleslaw, I wasn't a fan. As for drinks, we had non alcoholic ginger beer and ginger beer float. And the DJ..props to him as he was playing some 90/'00s jams from way back..brings back middle school memories lol.  Great place, definitely coming back again for more bbq!"}
{"text":"So good! The pulled pork, brisket, home fries and beans are soooo delicious. It's a bit pricey though for what it is. It's very casual and you basically serve yourself. For two people (though I admit we ordered a bit too much), including drinks and everything it was around $75. I would come back though, just not often."}
{"text":"Great place for BBQ eats, never too crowded, and the beef brisket is to die for!"}
{"text":"My experience here was mediocre at best, which was surprising, and disappointing, considering the plethora of good reviews.  My husband and I went in just after 5pm on a Saturday.  We got off to a bad start when, after making it to the front of the line to order our food, the cashier tells us to wait so she can put the dreaded \"sold out\" sign on top of the pulled pork.  We'd been planning to order pulled pork, so had to make a last minute change.  What BBQ place runs out of pulled pork at 5pm on a Saturday night in the summer?  We ended up ordering a half pound of brisket, a half chicken and sides of coleslaw and chilli which ran us roughly $45.    It was a gorgeous day, so we hit the patio.  The extra star is for the awesome patio and views, which are pretty spectacular.  Our food came quickly but it wasn't hot.  It was lukewarm at best.  The brisket was unfortunately dry and we had to slather it in BBQ sauce to make it taste better.  The chicken was tender and was the best part of the meal, but didn't knock my socks off or anything.  The chilli was flavourless and the coleslaw was fine, but nothing to write home about.  There are so many excellent BBQ places in the City and unfortunately this place didn't stack up for us.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"I love me some BBQ, but I did not enjoy the ribs from here at all. The rib was monstrous in size, but it was disappointingly tough to chew and heavy on smoke.   I came here for dinner on a Friday and they were sold out of brisket and had run out of bread. Maybe my friends and I had the tail ends of their meat supply, but for $30 to get one rib, pulled pork, slaw, and beans I'd rather spend my money elsewhere.   Trying to find seating in the food hall is like a live re-enactment of the hunger games. People will watch tables like hawks without saying a word and pounce as soon as someone makes a move to leave. Overall, I wasn't impressed with my experience here but I'm not deterred from trying their other location!"}
{"text":"Hmmm I'm not too sure what the hype is all about. While the experience is definitely a pleasant and unique one for Toronto, I found the food only OK and a bit overpriced.  We had the brisket, 1lb ribs and side of BBQ beans. The portion sizes were much smaller than I expected for the amount we paid. We also found the meat to be bland.  The beans though, were absolutely amazing - there was something about the bbq sauce that they used - it was great!  As per the other reviews, the place is pretty \"self-serve.\" We arrived at 6:30pm on a Friday and were greeted with a long line and some anxiety - for fear that we would not be able to find a table to eat. We did manage to nab the last few seats - others after us had to settle for high tables.  The venue itself was very cute and a great summer spot to enjoy a few drinks with friends on a patio. Great live entertainment and lovely atmosphere overall!"}
{"text":"so 2 weeks ago i wrote a review about a sit down experience which was not very good.   i liked the brisket and beans enough to try take out with them.  one of the past problems i mentioned in the review was the fact they had run out of ribs and sausages by 5:00 in the afternoon. a definitive management failure.  so i ordered over the phone for pick up today a full rack of ribs, 3 orders of the brisket and beans and chili sides. $105. [she repeated the order to me 3 times.....]  well here comes the hammer: the morons, sorry but on a 4 item order to screw up the #1 component makes you a moron, they gave me 3 orders of pulled pork. swimming in grease like the last time and this time overly salted too. not a shred of brisket. and the beans were so spicy my dinner companions wouldn't eat them after one try.  so along with the not so great pulled pork [i make better at home] were the ribs and sorry again but they were crap.  no rub like the brisket the ribs are just smoked naked and the smoke flavour was pretty bad. a very european/german smokiness which i guess makes sense when you think of the detestable cole slaw which sort of had a horrid bavarian flavour from the red cabbage. this is not southern usa or any other american style ribs.  good luck guys. never thought i'd pine for the cherry street diner but i will never order from these morons again.  ps and cheap morons too. a drip of sauce on the pulled pork and no sauce on the side."}
{"text":"We ordered their full rack ribs and beef brisket take-out. They gave us a very generous portion of ribs, which we had two meals from. Flavour had a bit of spiciness to it, but was an overall great taste.   Brisket was a bit dry though. Could be more moist.  Overall, the bbq was done quite well, and justifies the price. Definitely a good bbq place in TO!"}
{"text":"Yum.... truly the best BBQ I've had in the city hands down. The staff were friendly, the food was delicious, so was the bourbon. Lawrence the owner and pitmaster took the time to chat with me, such a nice guy. The brisket was perfect, the side ribs were smokey and delicious and the fried potatoes with Mac sauce were a perfect side. And the best part (well, for me)? Totally gluten free! A definite must try for BBQ in the city!"}
{"text":"We went in around 6:00pm and it wasn't too busy inside.  We were greeted by a woman that worked there that described to us how we order, sit down and the food will be brought to us.  It was our first time here so we took a couple of minutes looking over the menu deciding what to get.   Brisket, ribs, sausage and beans was our order.  The food arrived to us less than 5 min later.   Everything looked good.  We got a bonus couple pieces of bread and some pickles and sliced jalepeno peppers.   The brisket had a nice looking bark and smoke ring however I found it a slight bit dry.  Same for the sausage.  The ribs and the beans are what really stood out.  The ribs were tender and had a real good flavour.  The beans were nice and smokey with just a hint of spice.   The staff was real friendly from the moment we stepped into the restaurant.  I was a bit disappointed with the brisket and sausage though.  Simple no-frills Texas style BBQ. No fancy plates, decor or fancy BBQ fusion style food here.  Just plain good old bbq Better than the average 'BBQ' restaurant in the Toronto area."}
{"text":"Amazing.  I had high expectations and they deliver. The concept is not a typical diner.  The concept is like a food truck or fast food restaurant with tables inside as well as more in the patio. You approach the counter and order your meal from a menu posted on a big sheet of poster sized paper. All prices listed include tax and they will cross off the items that are sold out each day.  Once you order, they give you a number display and you find a table anywhere on the premises. They also have a full bar to order beer on tap or rail drinks. I order their recommend double stack burger which was amazing. My friends wanted to try to brisket and philly steak sandwich.  Next time, I will definitely order the brisket and ribs when I have a bigger appetite.  The patio is larger than the inside so I am unsure whether they will operate during the winter due to size and location. They need to maximize the summer season by encouraging more people to come with great music from a live DJ. There is plenty of street parking as well as a few lots including a supermarket nearby.   I called them to ask about reservations which they told me that it's first come first serve. However, I believe if you are a regular, they will make an exception as i saw the reservation signs whipped out when we left.  Can't wait until I go back next time."}
{"text":"The ribs we ordered for dinner we felt must have been cooked at lunch time, left over, and then reheated for us as they were so dry and black on top. The slaw had so much vinegar that also went uneaten.  There will not be a repeat visit."}
{"text":"I really like Cherry Street BBQ; the atmosphere is right, the food is good, and the service is good. There's not much to dislike about this place. They serve up some good BBQ here.  I came here with my partner on a Friday evening and the place wasn't all too busy. There was plenty of space indoors in the main hall with the majority of people sitting outside on the patio with live music. The atmosphere was lovely, you can see the Toronto skyline in the distance, and it was the perfect combination of liveliness and quaint-ness. You order at the counter, and the food comes to you after. Water is self serve, there's paper towels, and extra BBQ sauce at your table - it's all very convenient and everything was just right here.   We went with 1/2 lb brisket, pulled pork with sides of potato salad and quinoa salad. It also came with some pickles, onions, jalapenos, and some slices of bread - which I really appreciate because it completed the meal.   We were big fans of the pulled pork which was juicy and succulent although it was a tad on the salty side. The brisket on the other hand was a bit confusing. I'd say it was somewhat disappointing. It was definitely tender and broke down easily but was more dry than I expected - which masked a lot of qualities of the brisket. The flavor is much more subtle than the pulled pork which was good. I'm a really big fan of their BBQ sauce which has a really nice sweetness to it and ended up almost drinking it because it was just that good!  The sides were also decent (especially the quinoa salad - a very good healthy option to make by the way!). It was really balanced with the ingredients in there but the potato salad on the other hand was more acidic than I expected. But I suppose when you eat everything together, it balances out. The portion size could have a been a bit better for the potato salad, but the quinoa is fine as it was packed.  Overall I really like this place and would definitely recommend it if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Stopped in here with bae before watching the Cirque de Soliel show across the street (thanks Yelp!).  When we arrived around 6pm, it was already very busy with almost no seats available. It seems most people grab take out from this location. They also have outdoor seating and they had heaters on when we visited but with temps dropping, I assume that portion won't be open much longer. We got lucky and found two stools open in the corner at the end of the bar. Decent beer selection and they also offer Jack Daniels' shots for $3.50. Side note, the highlight of the experience for sure was the bartender - a really nice dude!   I'm not so much into meat these days (I guess I am more of a reduct-arian?) but there were a few veggie options to choose from. We ended up ordering the beef brisket, mac n' cheese, beans, coleslaw and a pulled pork sandwich. They give you a number that you take to your table, then deliver the food a short while later (came out fast).  Bae enjoyed the meats, saying they were a-ok but nothing to write home about (ie not the best he'd ever had). I love love love mac n cheese and found this version to be sort of bland. Felt like it needed salt? Beans were good but our batch was super spicy and I don't mind heat. For the coleslaw, they do a vinegar based version. I am more of a creamy coleslaw gal but the tanginess of the slaw cut the heat of the beans nicely.  Good choice if looking for a quick meal in the area."}
{"text":"Ok first things first.  For all those who frequented and loved the old Cherry for a friendly breakfast or lunch will be surprised with the complete change over.  New owners, new menu, new service, new setup.   Lunch service is only available on weekends. Otherwise it's strictly dinner service throughout the week.  Interior has been renovated with the removal of several tables in lieu of a full service bar. Seating indoors is limited, which is fine in summer with the outdoor patio, but not sure what they'll do in the winter months. The parking lot has pretty much been taken up with their meat smokers so you'll have to use the limited spaces on Cherry St.   There is a distinct feeling that the whole operation has been streamlined to maximize profit and minimize loss. Very much like a takeout or food truck you order and pay for your food at the counter, likewise with the bar should you also require refreshment. Note they do not serve coffee or tea - only 'bar' service.  You pick a table to sit and your order is brought out to you. Food is served on an aluminum tray with paper plates and plastic cutlery.  Ok the food. I had the brisket with a side of broccoli quinoa salad. It arrived with two slices of generic white bread, some garnishes of sliced onion, pickles and hot pepper.  There was no butter or margarine for the bread. The brisket was very good with the right amount of saltiness and fat. The outside was blackened and crispy. Broccoli quinoa salad was also excellent.   In the past few months there has been an explosion of bbq joints opening up in the GTA.  The food at the new Cherry is good.  Food - 4 stars Service, decor, setup - 3 stars"}
{"text":"Food was not good when we went. You order from a take out area and they bring you the food on a metal tray, feels a bit like a school lunch room/Jail. I did like the pulled pork sandwich, but it was literally soaking with whatever juices. I ordered a caesar from the bar which tasted nothing like a cesar I have ever had before. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Definitely try the brisket, pulled pork, and beans. The brisket and Pulled pork have a lot of flavor and tender af. The baked beans have quite the spice to them. Mac and cheese isn't heavy and could use a bit more sauce. Bread is wonderbread. But the jalapeños on the side are a nice touch. Portions are on the smaller side.  Beers and the patio are amazing in the summer. Now that it's fall it's still steady and busy on weekend evenings. Service is okay and you have to really call on servers/ eye heavily and make motions that your glass is empty."}
{"text":"Cafeteria style ordering, go to cash counter, place order and pay for food. You get a number on a stand that you place on your table. Staff bring the simply mouth watering food. Yes it was expensive but it was soooo good. Meats are sold by the half pound. The beef brisket was simply the best I've ever had, sooo tender and flavourful. Sides of mac 'n cheese, potatoes, and cole slaw were just okay. I love Pepsi, but not from Cherry Street Bar-B-Que."}
{"text":"Food: 4/5 Service: 4/5  Ambience: 4.5/5   My boyfriend and I got 1/2lb brisket (comes with two slices of bread, pickles, and jalapeno, $13), smokey broccoli and quinoa salad as a side ($4.5), and chicken sandwich ($9.5?). Brisket was so tender you don't even need a knife to cut it. It had this smokey flavour and crusty burnt skin. For me, the side we got was the highlight of the meal just because it wasn't something we expected. A generous amount of broccolis with quinoa, craisins, onions and topped with creamy dressing and sunflower seeds. I highly recommend this side if you want to try something new.   The chicken sandwich was also good, chicken meat was tender, moist and flavourful. Unfortunately, we found a bone in it half way through.... we told the waiter, and he sent a manager. The manager handled it very well by apologizing and replacing the half of the sandwich with some pulled pork and mac and cheese. Pulled pork was good but for some reason it was smothered in lots of oil (transparent, pure liquid oil from the pork...). There was nothing special about mac and cheese.   Overall, decent food at reasonable prices plus, great ambience with a spacious patio. The staff here was friendly and attentive. I would recommend this place to anyone who craves for BBQed meats."}
{"text":"I don't write reviews, but the Brisket sandwich has proven to be consistently perfect every time. I can't stop going back"}
{"text":"Really fine. Not crowded on a Wed at noon. Wonderful ribs and best tasting pulled pork ever. Only downer was cole slaw which was essentially tasteless and overpriced and the plastic fork."}
{"text":"Finally got the try this place on my bike ride. Always admired a business that is willing to be off normal beaten path. Took a small walk around back to checkout the two large smoker barbecues. The smell of burning wood fills the air making my taste buds water. I ordered the brisket sandwich and an order of side ribs too. Brisket sandwich has a generous amount of beef brisket topped with coleslaw and pickles. The side ribs are dry rubbed and smoked until absolutely tender. There is a squeeze bottle of BBQ sauce at table , to add to your hearts content. Love this sauce! Oh So Good! I'll be back again to try the BBQ chicken! The Staff in this place are great delight. So happy to have had a lunch here. Cheers to Cherry Street Bar-B-Que!!"}
{"text":"I've been back many times now and the food portions and quality are extremely inconsistent.  We used to get two fat slices of brisket per order (half pound), and now it's just one (and it's not just one bigger slice). We had a take out order that day and we actually went back in to tell them that they forgot the other slice and they just took it back and added it no questions asked. Strange, it's almost like they knew it was not a proper portion. The flavour on the brisket is still great. Sometimes though, the meat is tough, and other times it's melt-in-your-mouth good.   The pulled pork can be extremely fatty and oily and not particularly flavourful. They may have bbq sauce now so that might help.  The baked beans are always solid.  The broccoli and quinoa side used to be good but now is awful. They forget to put the sauce one time. And another time, the broccoli was grey and it looked like it'd been in the freezer. It did taste fresh at all. However, they took this back as well no questions asked and gave me another side.   +1 for customer service at least."}
{"text":"I hosted a large party of people here last night for my 29th birthday. We had between 20-25 people come through throughout the night and we did the family style menus which came with all the meats and sides. It was delicious and a lot of fun! Great way to have a big group gathering for sure and the atmosphere was intimate and perfect for a party. Service was really organized. Alex was taking care of our group and I highly recommend requesting him if you ever have a large party - he was exceptional and we all loved him. He was on top of every little request and did an awesome job of looking after everyone! Highly recommend this spot - such a great find in the city and will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"This is a great addition to see in this otherwise 'quiet' area. The building has been nicely renovated. Compared to Adamson's.. They have more selection, the ribs/brisket slightly preferred at Adamson's. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Great BBQ here.  I had the brisket, potato salad, baked beans and a bourbon lemonade.  Delicious, the brisket was melt in your mouth, the beans had kick and the bourbon lemonade was perfect to walk it down.  Busy and they run out of items as the day goes on so get here early.  A bit out of the way in the portlands but worth it, go!"}
{"text":"My bf ordered pulled pork with the side of beans and I ordered the brisket with mac & cheese. The mac & cheese and beans were yummy. Not a fan of pulled pork, that's why I had the brisket. However, the pulled pork was amazing and wished I ordered it instead of the brisket. The brisket was good but not impressive. It's a little pricey for the quality and quantity. For the price, I expected substantial courtesy side dish and not just a couple of jalapeño and raw onions that you can't actually eat. The place is nice and cozy. The staff is super friendly. Would probably come back in the summer. Would still recommend to friends to try. It's still good but I've had better."}
{"text":"The food here is really awesome. There are a few bbq places around town and I must say this is probably one of the best.  We got the pulled pork sandwich (5 stars), the beans (5 stars, smoked alongside the meat for extra flavour), the Mac and cheese (4 stars), and the brisket (3.5 stars).   The place is self serve so you have to go up to order and the food comes out super fast. Service in the patio overall on the other hand is super slow.   The only downside of the place is more than half the menu was sold out when we went (at 7pm on a Sunday). The only meat options available were the pulled pork and brisket. When I asked why the waitress mentioned that they have limited capacity in their smokers - which I get except it doesn't explain why they were also out of home fries. Sounded more like poor management to me."}
{"text":"Change your hours you stupid idiots. It's 1am on Saturday and its crickets out front of your door. Thanks for nothing."}
{"text":"Great Vibes, Great BBQ, and Great times.   Cherry St BBQ has impressed me several times. I always leave happy and satisfied. I've had the Brisket & Pulled-Pork Sandwich. I've also had the Double Stack Cherry Mac-Burger. In terms of sides, I've tried the Mac & Cheese and Home fries. I also gave the sausage a try.   I have to say the Pulled Pork Sandwich was my favourite. The meat is juicy and flavourful from the smoke. In terms of sides, I would go for the Home Fries. If you go, try the Sausage. It has that nice snap and with each bite you are getting a burst of flavour.   Keep Eating,   Angela"}
{"text":"Melt in your mouth smoked barbecued meat!  Not to be missed!!!!!!!.  You can taste the flavourful meat that is not drowned in sauce like so many other restaurants. Limited seating inside so go early to not miss out. Tray service  - so you place your order at the front and your tray will be delivered to your table. Friendly and helpful staff staff"}
{"text":"I saw the good reviews and decided to check out this place.  I ordered the Brisket meat, it tastes very good. The BBQ bean side is a bit salty. many people come and watch games here, it's a place for spending time with your friends."}
{"text":"You don't need to visit Texas anymore! I used to say that Toronto does all foods well except for BBQ, Cherry Street BBQ changes my mind :-) If my next visit is as good as this visit I will give them their fifth star.  What sets apart a good restaurant from a great restaurant, aside from food, is the people, and I really liked the people at Cherry Street BBQ. They were super friendly and upbeat, and Lawrence, the owner and pit master came over and asked us if we liked the food. Then Lawrence took me on a tour of the smoker and took me the story of restaurant and his experiences and he made me laugh a bunch of times along the way.  The brisket was butter soft and very tasty. It came \"Texas taco\" style with a couple of pieces of white bread, sliced onions and sliced jalapeños, mmmm. We also ordered the side ribs (they were out of back ribs, see my pictures for the work in progress) and the taste was spot on, the only problem was we didn't order more.  My friend Wendy said her Pulled Pork Sandwich was the best ever, she is a tough critic and if she says its good then its good. Wendy let me have a bite of her sand which and I agree, the Pulled Pork Sandwich is a beautiful thing.   The sides were also very good, we had the broccoli and quinoa salad and smashed potatoes.  There is indoor and outdoor seating and they have live music Fri and Sat nights. Give them a try and let me know how you like it."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this visit I was disappointed with my Beef Brisket sandwich.  The meat was completely dry.  The Mac & Cheese wasn't that great either.  The chicken sandwich was good though."}
{"text":"Okay BBQ, ordering process is a little different. We just waked into the patio and didn't realize you had to order inside. Food itself is good but value for money is poor. Expensive for the portion size."}
{"text":"Cherry Street Bar-B-Que's main location has been on my hit list for a while but they were closed for a private event when I went there over the summer. I was happy to see them represented at Assembly Chef's Hall. Despite all the other choices, I had to try their food.  The brisket ( 1/2lb @16.95) was melt-in-your-mouth fork tender and the side ribs ( 1/2lb @ 9.00) came off the bone perfectly. Both, however, while cooked very well, could have used more flavour, even more smoke. Was there supposed to be a sauce with it?  I love coleslaw (4.95) but didn't care much for this one (vinaigrette). I prefer creamy so maybe that's just me.  At almost $40.00, with tax and tip, no beverage, it was pricey and therefore a little disappointing."}
{"text":"A great spot for BBQ, ribs and hanging out on the patio (if you can find a spot). We came on a summer night and the weather was perfect for sitting outside. At night, they have pretty patio lights that make the space very intimate and welcoming. Also, there is bar conveniently situated outside for easy access to cold drinks and cocktails.   The food is delicious and you can tell they took a long time smoking and cooking their various meat options. The prices are comparable to eating at a restaurant in central downtown, with a sandwich floating around the $11 mark. The ribs are on the more expensive side ($21 for half rack, $42 for full), but they are generous with their portions and worth a try.   The restaurant location is a little bit of a hike, especially for those using the TTC. It's by the lower Donlands, at the very end of Cherry Street. I don't know what you would be doing here, unless you were going to Cirque or the nearby T&T."}
{"text":"Food good. Setup odd. People nice. Money gone.   Walk in, find table. (You will not be seated, no one will come to get you. If you wait, you will look new, not just to the restaurant, but to earth)  Claim table with jacket, backpack or park your fave, but rotund Uncle who prefers to sit.  Walk over to wall with menu items, there are no food menus.   Pick food items. NOTE: Each meat is too much for 1 person. Order 2 or 3 meats & 1 or 2 sides. for 3 adults.   Approach Cash register, say items.   You will know you have succeeded if they give you a tall metal thing with a number on it.   Take back to Rotund Uncle. He will pick it up, and look at all sides of it.   Notes:   - the sausage is truly delicious. Delicious like a cupcake, only this cupcake is very much like  sausage with a casing and hipster coddled pork or beef.  - The potato side was good. Very homemade taste. Homemade if you have a McDonalds style deep fryer in your home. - The brisket. More tender than my inner thighs after a brisk August stroll. FOODIES: It has a decent smoke ring.   With all of lives challenges and temptations, all I am thinking about is that sausage. This is not code for anything."}
{"text":"Had the brisket, coleslaw, and home fries. Nicely cooked, and coleslaw and home fries were good as well. Nice atmosphere and friendly staff. Interesting industrial patio and small stage and DJ that comes at night. I came in the afternoon, so not sure what the night time atmosphere is like but they seem good from the day time atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great BBQ, Great time, I've had pretty much all the meats they have on offer and love them. The brisket is one of the best I have had in Toronto."}
{"text":"Love this place. The brisket is as good or better than any I've had in Texas.  Easy to get to, they don't seem to sell out so when you are starving and have a late lunch, you can get served.  Especially love their banana pudding!"}
{"text":"Pros: - Delicious food! (Had baby back ribs, super yum brisket btwn the buns, mac 'n cheese with a hint of jalapeño, and home fries) - Relaxing and lively vibe - Friendly and helpful cashier - Patio   Cons: - Patio. Well, seating is first come first serve, so snatching a table on a day with good weather can get cut throat  Will strategically time my next visit and be a lot more aggressive snatching a table next time :P"}
{"text":"We stopped in at the Cherry Street Bar-B-Que on our way to a Cirque Du Soleil show. Keep in mind this is the only place that's around the Port Lands area and it's incredibly busy around the shows times - so be wary of that. Otherwise, it's pretty easy to get a table and the wait is usually not so long.   We ordered the Brisket, Double Stack Cherry Mac Burger & Broccoli Quinoa Salad (split between two people).  All items above were very good, the brisket was juicy and tender - melted in your mouth. I would recommend the spicy bbq sauce (not served unless asked for) to kick it up a notch. The burger and salad were decent as well.   I would stop in again the next time i'm in the area..."}
{"text":"Made a point of going (it is after all a bit out of the way) and was pleasantly surprised.   Reading one of the comments yes you should not put your expectations high on the cutlery or serving trays, but do expect amazing BBQ which suggests the plastic cutlery is meant to convey the message that you are about to enjoy tender meats and great sides - where your focus should be.  I am not given them 5 stars only because they opt for the 16 oz beer - which they do price accordingly.   Will be back and back."}
{"text":"We went Sunday for the lunch, and we will be back for sure, it was the best brisket and pulled pork we ever had. We also really liked the place and the atmosphere. 5/5"}
{"text":"This is a very interesting place in the middle of Cherry Street.   The setup is kinda odd. You place your order for food & you pay in the spot & it's then delivered to your table. For the liquor, you have table service & a tab?! I don't get it but the place was jammed at dinner time.  The food was very good. The best beef brisket I've ever had. It was tasty, large & tender! The pulled pork & sausage were very tasty as well. The Mac & Cheese & the coleslaw were just moderately good. I'd for sure redo this place."}
{"text":"Pros: MMMM, Meat!!  Cons: Line ups can be long  Came here after a day at Taiwanfest on the recommendation of a friend and was totally not disappointed!  It's hard to find BBQ places like this in general these days.  So to find one this good is always a blessing!  As soon as you come in, you will basically walk right up into the line up.  It's that busy here.  You won't be assigned a seat here.  You come in, order, and then find any seat that's available.  There's a large patio outside and some seats with a bar inside.  They have a pretty simple menu here but everything they do here, they do very well.  We came as a group of 4 with 3 children so we ordered a bunch of things to try them as much as possible. We ordered the brisket, side ribs, beef ribs turkey and a bunch of sides.  Just look at the pics I took.  Me trying to describe everything just wouldn't do it justice.  It's all done very well.  Even the mac and cheese and home fries are so good!!  The beef rib here is a mammoth piece of meat. There's no way around that, give it a whirl, you won't be disappointed.  The service here is very friendly.  The servers go around chatting everyone up.  It's a very homey atmosphere here.  I was surprised to see how kid friendly this place was as well. We didn't have any trouble eating here with 3 children.  The music on the patio can be a bit loud though, so eating inside is the way to go if you have little ones with you.  I love this place.  These places are few and far between so when you find a great one, it's a great feeling.  I'm definitely coming back whenever I'm in the area and feeling like BBQ."}
{"text":"Where to begin? We saw this restaurant featured in Toronto Life so my friends and I knew this would be the next spot we would try as well as celebrating our BFF's Birthday. We arrived around 6:30pm and the patio and inside were pretty full. Luckily some people were leaving so we were able to grab a spot.  The style is you order ahead, and take a number and they bring the food to you hence there are no reservations, first come first serve type of place.   We thought they had a BBQ platter based on all the pics we've seen on Yelp, but really it's people ordering a bunch of stuff and they placed it on one platter. We wanted to try it all so we pretty much ordered everything on the menu lol. What I will recommend is Brisket - melt in your mouth and so good. Took some leftovers to work the next day and folks were coming to my desk to see what I had. It came with onions, jalapeños and 2 slices of white bread. I wish they could up their bread game with a bun or something but white bread was still fine. If you like some chicken, it was so juicy and flavourful. We also ordered a full rack of ribs but they aren't fall off the bone kind of ribs. But again, packed with flavour and really good. The Cherry Mac burger was absolutely amazing. Seriously one of the best burgers I've had. Everything is pretty much a hit on their menu. For the sides we tried Mac and cheese, beans - to die for, this is a must get side, potato salad, coleslaw and home fries. I liked all the sides minus the coleslaw. It's a vinegar type coleslaw, it's good but it wasn't memorable for me.   For drinks we tried the root beer float (forgot the official name). Really good. Lots of beers and good selection of drinks. Service was amazing. People came by to grab our empty trays, owners came by to check up on us. There are also 2 bars - one on the patio and one inside so that is super convenient!  Special shout out to their DJ. He played the best tunes during dinner. Kind of a throwback for a few of us.   We'll definitely be back. Sad to say I want this gem to be hidden so it's not packed every time I go, but the lines are starting to go out the door during their peak times so come early! Bold statement, but it's the best BBQ I've had in Toronto. Glad to see more places opening up on Cherry St!"}
{"text":"The food is so good I had to change my panties. 5 stars.  You honestly can't make a wrong choice here, but I highly recommend the ribs and the brisket.   The music is also super stellar."}
{"text":"This place is great! The brisket is so tender. Ribs are mouthwatering. Sides are good too, especially the quinoa salad. Fun patio with a nice view of the tower. Great staff."}
{"text":"Happened by this place on a bike ride.  We share the side ribs and pulled pork and cole slow.  The ribs were well smoked , really meaty, and very tasty.  A little chewy not fall off the bone which is just how we like it.  The pulled pork was really good... tender, moist with a great sauce.  Nice vinegar based coleslaw with red cabbage. ... very crunchy and a great side. Great beers and cocktails ... I had the 3 speed pilsener.  Great Motown music playing with a super casual vibe.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Went there before Luzia which is just across the street. Nice large patio and friendly staff. We ordered ribs, brisket and chicken sandwich along with coleslaw, potato salad and mac n'  cheese as sides. The chicken sandwich was excellent generous portion moist smokey breast of chicken. The ribs were somewhat under-smoked and were tough. No sauce. Replacement ribs were marginally better. Any BBQ joint in the the southern US has much better ribs. The brisket was delicious, but one small slab that may have been 8 ounces when the cow was alive! Served with a bit of onion and jalapeño. No sauce.  The beef was served with 2 slices of Wonder Bread. (Why bother?). The slaw was decent. The mac n cheese was watery and tasteless. The vinegar based potato salad was good. With one coke and one beer about 60 bucks. This place is a work in progress, and not a definite 'must go back'."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty tasty and is well priced. Before alcohol, probably less than $40 total would get you stuffed.   Similar to other BBQ places, you order first and find a table to eat at. Its generally pretty busy, especially when the patio is not open; it may be hard to find a table. We came once in the middle of summer and it was easy to find a seat inside. Came back again in the fall and the inside dining area is packed.   The brisket is fine. Tasty, but definitely not the best I've had. The pulled pork was okay, but would not get again. Their sides are all amazing tho, especially the potatoes. We've come back here just for the potatoes.   If you don't mind walking for 4-5 minutes, there is lots of street parking around the corner."}
{"text":"Came here after axe throwing.  The prices were really great.  When they told me they had $5 pints during happy hour (which was from like 8 to midnight), I was super happy. Boneshaker and Cruiser on tap. Plus it looked like they had some pretty nifty specialty drinks.  I didn't get food but my friends did and it smelled great and the prices for food were reasonable too!   Really great music, a nice, big patio, and cute interior.  Would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Mm.. mmm... yummy. Simply the best. Nice place, amazing food. Friendly staff. Lots of parking available"}
{"text":"I came for the first time today and sat on the awesome patio. I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the view of the Toronto skyline. This is also one of my boyfriend's favourite places to eat. Although I only ate the Mac and Cheese, it was still one of the best I ever had. The only down side is that they ran out of chicken (chicken is the only meat that I eat). Next time, I will make sure to call ahead of time and ask to see if they have chicken before coming! (cause I am dying to try it!!). Overall, great place!"}
{"text":"Above average BBQ. I understand some of the complaints about portion size (I'm always skeptical when I'm told I'm getting an exact measurement and it's in one piece) and BBQ can be subjective but I enjoyed everything I tried (brisket, ribs, beans). I didn't feel like it was the best BBQ I've ever tried, but I would return."}
{"text":"Popped in on a Saturday night before a Leafs game and considered just watching it there. The BBQ is all ordered by conveniently by weight, and you can order your fixins as sides. We opted for the brisket, pulled pork, back ribs, mac n cheese and beans. Everything was fantastic, although I wasn't a huge fan of the apple cider vinegared pulled pork, but I think that might be a regional style. The mac n cheese should definitely not be missed, and the beer list really rounds out the menu. Can't wait to check out the patio this summer."}
{"text":"Hubby loves BBQ, so having heard great things about Cherry Street BBQ, we called ahead and picked up a take out order for him after a visit to Cherry Beach leash free dog park.  He ordered:  the brisket sandwich, steak and cheese sandwich, baked beans and coleslaw.  The brisket was tender, good quantity, but surprisingly the real winner was the steak and cheese sandwich.  The steak was tender with nice grilled vegetables and tasty cheese.  Both sandwiches were served on great buns - usually an afterthought, or worse wonder bread, these buns were soft, fresh and tasty.  Baked beans were excellent, rich and dark, perfectly cooked, not hard or mushy.  Just great.  Hubby had chosen the coleslaw as a side because he liked vinegar based coleslaw but there wasn't much to it - just vinegar and cabbage, and given it was the same size container as the beans, not great value.  Next time more beans.  We were glad we got takeout because the latest Cirque de Soleil show  across the street created parking nightmares in the area, so plan accordingly!  We will be back.  So convenient after taking dogs to the beach."}
{"text":"The key to my heart sure is brisket. Ordered a delicious, fat 1/2 lb of brisket from Cherry Street and was not disappointed. Very tender yet didn't melt apart when forked at. Good, attractive cut. Accompanied with a small portion of jalapeno, onion, and pickle. Could have used more of each of those. Great temperature.   Located at The Assembly, seating was clean with plenty of available tables to eat. If you're not craving Asian or Mexican, definitely among the top contenders for your appetite. Would absolutely eat here again. 4/5"}
{"text":"I went here on a weekday for dinner. Parking is very limited and no more parking on the side street. So I just park by T&T and walk over. Patios wasn't open due to raining weather.   When entering I didn't expect it to be very small. You would go up and pay for what you like and they give you a number. Finding a seat was very difficult because allot of tables were reserved and there weren't many tables since the place is very small.  You would also have to go up to the bar and pay separately for your drinks.  I didn't like the layout.  Food: I got the ribs and home fries and my bf got the brisket sandwich with mac n cheese.   The ribs was good and had good seasoning but it wasn't the best I ever had. (3 slice of ribs)  The brisket sandwich was very tasty! I would def recommend any meat on a bun and their home fries.  Mac n cheese was okay.    Overall it's a really nice place with good sandwich but I wouldn't visit again since it wasn't worth it for me."}
{"text":"I have driven by this place several times while going to TNT Supermarket and finally decided to try them after my friend raved about their food on Facebook.  First of all this not your typical restaurant/bar. You have to order your food at one station and your drinks at another. Once you order your food you are given a number and the food gets delivered to you. You then have to go to the bar and order your drinks, so essentially you pay separately for both orders which is a bit of an inconvenience. But Yelp is all about the food and that is why I am giving them 4 Stars. The slow cooked brisket is to die for and sides like a mac and cheese and their homemade coleslaw will compliment your meals.  They have domestic and craft beers, and ciders available as well as a nice coctail menu. Service is a little slow here but I am guessing because its always very busy and the food is cooked to perfection. If you are craving bbq, whether it be ribs, brisket, sausage, or chicken and are not concerned with fancy plates and 5-star service, this place is definitely for you. I will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"I love a good bbq and my search in Toronto has kept me trying more.  With Assembly Chef hall announcing Cherry St BBQ arrival, this was possibly my first stop for a meal.    I know with bbq, you have regional differences and the conversation on these differences are so ridiculously passionate that you can cause rift in families from it.  Go talk to a person in North Carolina about Texas BBQ and you'll feel the heat within seconds.  And I'm not talking about the heat from BBQ either.    I've talked a lot about the Assembly chef hall in their own review but simply said, I love the spot and I love the concept.  This is badly needed in Toronto and Im grateful they did it.  The atmosphere is a chill and vibrant place that makes you want to come back and try other spots.  With Cherry St, service here is loud and happy.  Can't fault a guy who is passionate about BBQ.  We did order the pulled pork that is spicy and a side of potato salad as well.  Pulled Pork - This was served closer to room temperature and not sure where the heat went.  We wanted it spicy but I would say it had none... less than mild heat.  The pulled pork was tender but there was no smoke or crusty and crunchy pieces from the outside mixed it.  I was looking for a bolder flavour.  It was all super soft pork which is ok to some but I love the outside brown bits.  3/5  Potato salad - Glad to see the potato wasn't over cooked that it disintegrated with a single bite.  Though tender and toothsome, I would say the flavour was light.  I'm used more mustard or bite to my potato salad.  For a side, it wasn't too big but enough to complete a meal. 3.5/5  Maybe I ordered wrong but the pulled pork didnt make me jump back and wanting to try the other cuts or types of bbq here.  Perhaps I'll try their other location and see how that goes."}
{"text":"Would definitely give it a 5 if I took the effort to write this up following my first visit.  After going there a few times, there's a few problems worth mentioning:  1. They don't hire enough staff at the bar. It takes forever (6-8 minutes) to get a beer on tap. If you do decide to get a drink, do it before you order your food.  2. Stuff just ran out all the time. There was once I was there by 8:30 (a bit late I know), and the only \"meat\" item that's left, is turkey and chicken. Not a fan of either, had them anyways. Still not a fan.  Note on point 2: I do think they should rather let stuff go out of stock, than serving dishes from the day before. The trick here is that...maybe just cook a tiny bit more than your expected sale. The main problem is location. Say if you have a place @ King & John, if you don't have brisket left, I might just eat somewhere next door. Cherry Street BBQ is, kinda in the middle of nowhere in terms of eatery. I go there, nothing is available, I get disappointed.  3. The last time I went there, they finally had brisket! And oh boy, it was DRY, for the first time. I'd like to believe it was an accident, rather than something worse. Honestly speaking, getting forced to eat chicken and turkey was...disappointing. Going all the way there to eat a piece of dry, well-done meat was no better.  I was tempted to give it a 3/5 as my last few visits had the problems listed above. However I do like the ambience and the food (when it's done right and available). I want it to live on, for a long time, while slowly getting even better (hopefully). There's the extra star, keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Four stars because for the price you pay you would expect table service.  With that in mind, when walking in and going up to the order counter and throughout the end of our meal service was very good.  What I did enjoy about the place was the atmosphere, totally relaxed and comfortable.  We got there around noon and we were their first diners.  The bronze medal Canadian Olympic Games were on and food was delicious.  We ordered: - Full Rack of Ribs  - Brisket - Double-Stacked Cherry Mac - Frito Pie - 2 orders of Home Fries  This came to over $30/pp and there were 4 of us.  The ribs reminded me of Chinese BBQ ribs done juicily but it seems like $40 for about 7-8 ribs was too expensive.  The brisket and the spices on it was what was worth it.  Apparently there is a night staff that comes in to monitor the smoker and that's how the flavour is created--slow BBQ'd.  The Double-Stacked Cherry Mac is pretty much a Big Mac made with brisket meal--it was good but what I found lacking was the flavour in the meat--but wow this burger dropped grease like no tomorrow!  The Frito Pie was delicious and it was basically a bag of Frito Lay cut open, cheese sauce and jalapeño introduced to it.  Downside, no sauce on the bottom so half of it was basically eatting chips out of the bag which means you're way over paying for this!  Everything was delicious but it is on the expensive side.  Although I was full I cold have eaten more.  There is a bar area where you can get your drinks which is quite annoying because you probably would just want to pay for everything at once...   All in all, I would come back for the brisket while watching a sports game but I prefer Barque!"}
{"text":"Love this place. First time I tried it and couldnt decide between 1/2 lbs of pulled pork or 1/2 lbs of brisket. So he suggested I just get 1/4 of each.   The good was great. Juicy, moist, mouth watering, fatty ... So noms. The only thing I had to complain about was the cole slaw wasn't amazing.   I definitely need to check out the main location and get the assorted platter. Can't wait"}
{"text":"Found the place by accident. Was just cycling by with some friends and heard the great music. Throwback songs mixed in with current songs. Staff was friendly and let us put our bikes inside (we didn't have our locks)  Food great!! Music great. Really nice people (staff and other customers, etc.). Great vibes. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"One of the best places for BBQ in the big smoke (Toronto).   Lawrence the Pit Master has it down to a science. From the baby back to the baked bean. You cannot go wrong. Just sit down have a drink and enjoy the BBQ."}
{"text":"3 Star for the Food 3.5 Star for their long hours and being LLBO 4 Star for their Patio Set up during summer (the view of CN tower is priceless!)  Cherry Street Bar-B-Que might not be me my favourite BBQ joint but love their setup and their vibes.  I only visited once but definitely would be back when I am in the area with some meat lovers!  I shared a Full Pound of Brisket, Half Rack of Ribs and a Sausage. I found both the brisket and ribs dry but luckily I was with the Eating Machine Lambert P and he ended up eating my share and more!  Cherry Street BBQ might not worth a special trip but definitely one of the better BBQ joint in the area."}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic - I found the portions to be pretty generous, and everything tasted amazing. We sat on the patio and were lucky enough to catch some live music. Perfect with a view of the skyline and great weather.   We enjoyed some cocktails as well and no complaints there. My only gripe was having to pay separately for food + drinks. The service was very friendly and efficient.   I would recommend this place - especially in Summer if you are eating in. The inside was nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"You literally cannot go wrong with **anything** on the menu here. 100% reccommend going here. In the summer the patio is alive with music and live acts from time to time! I know it's a little out of the way, but the atmosphere and good vibes make it worthwhile!"}
{"text":"This place is a solid 3 stars for me. During my visit I had the Brisket, the pulled pork, the mac & cheese, home fries, potato salad, the coleslaw & their special Meatball sandwich.   Why 3 stars? All the food was good (except the meatball sandwich, I'll get to that after). But -1 for not having cornbread. Seriously? A BBQ PLACE without CORN BREAD!?   Onto the meatball sandwich, it was meh. The bread was kind of stale, the sauce tasted similar to ragu and the meatball itself didn't taste or feel like it was made from ground beef (which I was expecting).   Regarding everything else we ate; it was good. Not great. Definitely more serious BBQ smoke houses out there with much better food.   I would come back for the pulled pork and mac and cheese, but only if I was in the area. Not worth the trek in my honest opinion."}
{"text":"I recently was bought a delicious brisket sandwich from Cherry St BBQ, and I enjoyed it very much. The tangy sauce was delicious and the meat was tender. The bun wasn't really my thing, but that's OK! Next time I'll get a platter instead of a sammie. Thanks for the pickle, boys. Nice touch."}
{"text":"I can't believe I didn't know about this place before! I have come to the area so many times and had no idea what I was missing out on! Saying I'm coming back is a given.  So what you walk in the place is big and clean, very simple. You go to the back, order they give you a number you go sit down and they bring the food to you. You can swing by the bar if you'd like as well. The food comes out quick and it's fresh. The meat is smoked! I got the pulled pork with a side of beans and oh boy!!!! Those beans!  For desert I had the Cherry Bourbon Pecan Pie and it was amazing! You can taste the bourbon but it was not over powering!  Lastly, the staff must get a shoutout because they were absolutely great! So friendly and helpful overall! They defiantly knew how to make the customers feel welcome!"}
{"text":"This is what a BBQ dream of and you will never get disappointed. We arrived late so the restaurant is full. (guys! Come early) it's deliciousness on the platter. I wanted to try some of their BBQ but can't fit inside my stomach. Definitely coming back ( earlier  )"}
{"text":"We went there for dinner and had side ribs, beef brisket, cherry cheesesteack, double stack, chili and mac and cheese. Too bad they were out of pulled pork and sausage that night. Everything was good, the meat was really good, tasty, tender and juicy. The only thing I won't order again is the burger which I think there are better places to go for burgers. But overall I had a good experience and enjoy the BBQ."}
