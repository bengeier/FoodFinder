{"text":"I ordered the Vega Dragon Roll and it was very good. This restaurant is really nice for a casual lunch."}
{"text":"FOOD: a large menu of japanese goodies! I have yet to be disappointed with any of my orders.

SERVICE: there's a \"door-bell\" at each table, so service is on a request basis. Works pretty well.  

COST: really good valued lunch combos! You can get a bento box with both bulgogi and sashimi for $13. Or 2 sets of rolls for $10. 

OVERALL: Conveniently just off the QEW, with ample free parking. Very nicely decorated japanese restaurant (chefs and servers dressed appropriately)."}
{"text":"Rolls are alright , fresh but seems very pricey. The mountain salmon roll didn't have enough salmon . The topping was mainly all tempura so for $15 it's a pretty expensive roll"}
{"text":"Best Sushi in the area . Been going here since they opened . Always super fresh
Very friendly staff"}
{"text":"Not bad but not great. We ordered takeout. One spicy salmon, spicy tuna, Appleby, unagi crunch and dragon roll. The spicy tuna and salmon were good but I didn't feel like there was much fresh fish. The unagi crunch was a little less cooked than I would have liked. I like a crispy eel but this one wasn't cooked much. The tempura in the dragon roll lacked spice and crunch. The Appleby wasn't bad but was somewhat bland also. Overall I am not sure I'd order from there again. Maybe I'll eat in next time."}
{"text":"If you're an ovo-lacto vegetarian like me, aka no fish, this place has got you covered. Its selection of sushi is a bit more expanded than the standard Avo Q and oshinko, with interesting maki's like Gaji (fried eggplant), and speciality vegetarian Dragon Rolls----though these will cost you. Worth a visit if you're in the area and appreciate quality!"}
{"text":"Quiet sushi place in Oakville, nice ambience. The menu was very diverse with sushi plus Korean options. I have the lunch combination which was a nice sample of several dishes, including vegetarian options. I had sushi, noodles and vegetable tempura.The tempura was so good! Huge quantity. Bibimbap is only a dinner item so I need to come back to try that. Overall food and service was lovely, glad I found the place!"}
{"text":"Little gem in Oakville! My fav place to get my bibimbap fix and sushi is also Fresh and delicious! And the tempura perfect ratio between batter and shrimp!! Oh and the sweet Potato side dish soo good!! :)"}
{"text":"This is a quiet small place nestled in the corner of the plaza on the northwest corner at Dorval and North Service Road.  It occupies a place that used to house an Italian restaurant hence the iron gates with the grape clusters :)

We were seated promptly by a friendly server.  We ordered the mountain roll and a sashimi dinner and sushi moriwase.  They brought complimentary banchan (bean sprouts, sweet potatoes, and a spicy pickled cucumber).

The roll was fresh, huge, and delicious.  Fresh fish, perfectly cooked rice, and crispy / spicy toppings.  The sashimi and sushi were all fresh and came with a generous amount of fresh wasabi and pickled ginger.

Definitely worth a repeat trip!"}
{"text":"Place offers amazing sushi - fresh, simple, authentic, and great service.  Small little place that isn't pretentious.  DORVAL ROLL was one of our favourites. Go try, our new neighborhood sushi place for now!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed on how fresh the sushi  and sashimi were, it melted in your mouth, the miso soup was delicious and hot. Our waitress was very friendly and efficient. I will visit this place again and let others know how good it was!"}
{"text":"Just came here for lunch. Restaurant has lovely casual atmosphere. The tea was piping hot, the miso soup flavourful, and the meal quick and delicious. The chicken they used for the teriyaki was all good pieces of white chicken breast, moist, and grilled perfectly. Teriyaki sauce and tempura dips were super tasty. 

Hope to come back a lot."}
{"text":"This is the first restaurant in oakville that we have craved and gone back for a second visit! (With many more to come.) my husband loves the sushi which is beautifully dished. I think the veggie fried rice is the best I've probably ever had. The chicken teriyaki at lunch is great as well.. Good portion and not expensive. As I said, our fave and also wallet friendly. The staff is great- so welcoming. Our favourite date spot :)"}
{"text":"This is my go to sushi place, the food is always very fresh and tasty, the staff is very friendly. This place gives the ma and pop feeling, it's also a great romantic place for a date."}
{"text":"They're So Happy to See You!

Like most Japanese restaurants, you're greeted at Sachi with a loud \"hello\" in Japanese and some friendly faces. Sachi is a Japanese/Korean Restaurant that has a nice interior with some friendly staff and what appears to be a Japanese sushi chef. They have the typical Japanese/Korean menu with sushi, noodles, bento boxes and grilled meats.

The interior and the service are better than the food. The Nabe Udon Seafood soup was a bit bland and even the chili pepper couldn't liven it up. The nigiri sushi is good but not \"best ever\". Anyone who says this is the \"best sushi around\" has never been to Mye in Oakville.

If you're in the Dorval-QEW area, Sachi is a good Japanese restaurant with friendly staff, a nice interior easy parking with good sushi and hot dishes."}
{"text":"Dropped in for a workday lunch with a colleague. The wait for service was a bit long - considering we were on our lunch break, but the food came pretty quick after. I had the avocado roll and a cucumber and avocado roll. Both were delicious and very very fresh! My colleague had a dragon roll(?). It had tempura sweet potato and was wrapped in fresh avocado. It was beautiful and she said delicious! Bonus- they have gluten free soy sauce! 
The inside isn't that nice - but the food and friendliness more than makes up for it. I'd definitely return next time I'm in the mood for sushi!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Oakville, great service and very friendly staff. The fish is always fresh and well made."}
{"text":"I'm biased but this is more Korean oriented restaurant rather than Japanese. I liked the menu so I can definitely come back."}
