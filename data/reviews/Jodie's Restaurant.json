{"text":"On a recent Saturday, our waitress was more busy chatting with departing guests than taking our order.  In fact she spent more time chatting than serving food.  Orders sat waiting until the most recent gossip was  passed on.  At least the food was okay.  First and last visit."}
{"text":"Solid, good diner food and friendly staff. Reasonable prices and a very relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great simple small town style diner. It's where you want to go. That's for sure."}
{"text":"Pleasant little surprise in the neighbourhood!

This is a greasy spoon for sure. The standard breakfast clocked in at just under $7 and included either coffee or tea. The breakfast is comprised of two eggs, toast (which they offer jam or peanut butter with), sausage/ham, and a small portion of hash browns.

The service was super friendly and efficient. We were both offered top ups on our beverages while we were there.

It's a bit run down but that doesn't change the good food. Definitely an affordable option for the area.

They also offer breakfast sandwiches and other basic breakfast plates (like an eggs benedict)."}

Wish they had this place up in the Yukon"}
