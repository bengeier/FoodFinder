{"text":"The staff is really nice and the cashier was so sweet, she took the time to explain the menu and she even customized my drink order, so it won't be too sweet. The food looks delicious and my peach tea tasted great."}
{"text":"This place it a mess-smh they took 15min to make a slushy, and there was no one in front of me. Then the guy comes and grabs the slushy from me and says \"I'm sorry I forgot to put sugar, I'll make it again\".. At this point I don't even want it any more. I'll never go back here!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get boba! I always order a watermelon slush, it tastes so refreshing and this is the only place I know of that serves real fruit aside from Tea Time cafe or Number 1 boba. This location is pretty close to my house, so it's convenient whenever I'm craving a smoothie. It doubles as a Thai place and I'm obsessed with their yellow curry, which is chicken, carrots, and potatoes in hot soup with a side of rice. It's not too spicy and it's pretty good. I like how spacious the store is and they play really good music, I love studying here and  or just catching up with friends. They have games and free wifi and will give you a student discount if you're in school which is a plus! (:"}
{"text":"Their dole whip is amazing and they have great costumer service! Love the variety of teas and drinks. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Have visited a few times for appetizers and boba. I liked the aloe tea and green grapefruit teas a lot. The ambiance is very teen friendly but other people would enjoy it too. Maybe you will overhear new slang or learn about an up-and-coming app. This is a great bonus! The staff sometimes wear bee wings and cat ears.  The chicken satay and beef jerk appetizers were very good, highly recommended. The fresh salad rolls were mediocre -- too much basil."}
{"text":"I ordered the spicy basil pork, it comes with white rice, and vegetables. The white rice is just plain, as it is expected. The side of vegetable are okay, but it could be better. The main dish is excellently seasoned, is well worth 7.95. I also ordered the lychee fruit slush with boba, that was one of the best boba drink I ever had.   The service is excellent. Happy to see you, treats all customer fairly, happy to answer any question.  And if that not enough, you can rent board game to play with the family when you are waiting for food or just want to kill time."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly. Tea tastes good, but the boba pearls are horrible, they taste hard, stale, and not freshly made."}
{"text":"Great staff and very nice place, but the boba always makes me feel sick for some reason. I've gone four times and each time the boba has made me feel sick and it has a very bitter taste."}
{"text":"The flavor was off, hard to describe but it tasted weird. I had the thai tea and my friend had a milk tea, both tasted weird and we've been to dozens of boba shops. The boba was old and very hard, when I asked about it the staff said that's the way it is and he implied I really didn't know what I was talking about. In addition, staff was abrasive and frankly kinda rude."}
{"text":"I ordered a thai iced tea with boba, and I'll have to say that this is probably better than some teas I've had in some thai restaurants, it wasn't overwhelmingly sweet or too creamy, texture was perfect, you can taste the tea definition pretty good, and the boba was perfectly al dente. I also noticed that they serve asian fusion style food here too, which is a plus! Im glad I don't have to drive to china town anymore for my boba fix since this place is only five minutes away,so I will be stopping by again, and again, and again..........."}
{"text":"The best Oreo cookie smoothie with my boba on the side. Perfect treat for that 'time of the month' lol."}
{"text":"My first time trying boba and I am impressed! Staff was very friendly and suggestive of different things to try. Got teriyaki chicken and lo mein and it was so delicious! The lo mein is literally phenomenal! I got back to the office raving about it and my entire team decided to go there for lunch! I AM SO HAPPY I TRIED SOMETHING NEW!  As long as the food continues to be amazing and the service continues to impress, I will be a loyal customer! I can't wait to try the watermelon slush! Keep it up Jackie Bee!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite boba places. Prices are decent, the menu is vast, and the first place I've ever had a chrysanthemum milk tea. Absolutely LOVE it, coming from a person who does not like floral milk tea drinks. A couple of other good choices would be the thai tea: can't really find a perfect mix like this any where else, the thai tea was balanced between whatever it is they put together. I normally get thai teas with more milk, or more tea, but this was a perfect combination; the green milk tea is also very top notch. I love it a lot. Something about their green milk tea always makes me want to only get it from here. The boba itself is super chewy, and not super sweet, which balances out the drinks. Definitely recommend this place, especially since it is very convenient to PVP Zone (next door), where you can play PC games, and order from Jackie Bees and they will come deliver it to you. I've never done it myself, but it also has a lounge kind of vibe where you can hang out and play games (board games)."}
{"text":"Finally visited this new boba place for a smoothie last Sunday.  Got in about 15 minutes after they opened. Luckily it wasn't busy and I got to order after a couple in front of me. There was a lot of interesting choices and toppings.   I settled on a strawberry lychee smoothie with strawberry popping pearls and boba. It's funny that for the longest time I had no clue what popping pearls were when I had them on ice cream maybe 2 years ago.   When I got my smoothie it was very pretty. Glad I took a picture before devouring it. The taste was not bad. Not too sweet or dull.  I would love to try some of their other drinks including an interesting one called a marshmallow tiramisu cocoa. Its a milk drink but I wonder if they offer a lactose or almond milk substitute."}
{"text":"If your a gamer this is the place to come too, great food and theres a gaming center nxt door, drinks smoothies you name it, the enviornment seems welcoming and the cashier who helped me out was very helpfull explaining the popular items overall def. Coming back"}
{"text":"Right across the CSN campus. The girl who's usually cashiering when I'm there is super sweet and she makes the experience 100 times better. Food is average but the staff makes up for it. Plus there's a gaming lounge next door which is great if you're a gamer in need of some snacks"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both experiences were great! The atmosphere is really chill, the food is great, and the service is better. Kevin, who helped me out, is super friendly! I'll definitely be coming around more often."}
{"text":"It is convenient very close to school. Located in front of CSN-Charleston. The drinks are alright. They don't have a lot of flavors either. But they give you a stamp card at least."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good food. From the name we didn't expect this variety. Best smoothie ever!"}
{"text":"Boba here was fine, but unfortunately the food  took 36 minutes to come out and was barely even warm. I ordered a beef and broccoli dish and it tasted strongly of fish. Food was a step below what I would feed my dog. Probably not coming back."}
{"text":"This is such an amazing place!!! There smoothies are truly all natural and the food is great!! If you ever need a place to relax or hangout with friends or family and love video games? This is the place for you!!! Definitely coming back!!!!"}
{"text":"We were craving a boba tea and so far our experiences have not matched the quality of the boba places in china town, Hawaii.  After debating what to order we decided to go with 2 drinks instead of 1 for each of us due to the higher prices here. We went with a strawberry mango slush that was said to use fresh fruit and a matcha tea that i wanted blended, which most boba places will offer at minimal or no charge.  Once we got our boba drinks, i was let down when the \"real fruit\" slush tasted like a powdered version that didnt seem to have actual fruit. Normally when it is a fruit slush you can see strawberry seeds or tiny chunks of mango imcorporated into the slush.   I chose the matcha tea with boba because it was a lot less pricey than the custom slushes. However i was unpleasantly surprised to see i was charged for a matcha slush. I like the creaminess of a green tea milk tea and instead got a plain matcha slush with little to no milk. Basically i paid a lot extra to get my order wrong. We will probably not be coming back, especially due to the high prices and lack of quality."}
{"text":"Good boba, but the thai food wasnt good, it was edible. Convenient thought, but not impressive."}
{"text":"My first experience here was great! I felt very welcomed. The environment was clean & bright. The employees were great & service was quick, but especially the employee Dielle. She was great! Bubbly attitude & look very determined to get my order right & fast! I love it here. I recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Amazing. One of my favorite places to go get a snack and yummy lemonade. Favorite dish: Spam Musubi. They have a good variety of popping pearls too that you can add to your lemonade. I frequently recommend to friends."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, the servers are great, and their drinks are incredible! I love it here, this is my go to place when I want to eat out but don't know where to go. I bring my out of town friends here too because the atmosphere especially at night is fun but chilled out at the same time"}
{"text":"Great place! The staff is friendly, the food is delicious  , and the place is so cute~ The atmosphere is also really relaxing~"}
{"text":"This place has only been open for approximately 4 weeks and my husband and I have been here 3 times already! As you can probably already tell, we are huge boba fans and love trying new boba places out, plus we just bought a place by Oakey and Torrey Pines so this place is way closer than Chinatown.   So here it goes.. the staff is super friendly! They have a huge selection of food! Everyone who works there is young and always happy :)   There are only 2 small things I don't like... I don't like that they don't offer my favorite drink, which is Taro Slush (smoothie) and the other thing is that the 1st time we were there and ordered their Teryaki chicken plate was so much better than the 2nd time we ordered it. The 2nd time tasted more like soy sauce rather than teryaki sauce... Other than that, we love it here :)"}
{"text":"Amazing compared to other places. I always come back! Great price for how much you get."}
{"text":"This place is great. Not too crowded either. And was here during lunch hr.  Food is excellent. Too bad I live in NLV. Otherwise I'd be here everyday."}
{"text":"Accidentally came across this place. Boba is what caught me. So I went in, was greeted by Kevin, super friendly, saw that there was Thai food as well... Asked for recommendations (I'm a pad Thai lover) so I ordered  that of course. He then recommend other dishes and I went with the yellow curry & the garlic chicken. Great choice. I enjoyed every dish. Aside from not getting my egg rolls as part of my lunch specials, the quality of service & food topped it."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The spicy spam musubi is amazing! They recently got a new chef and now their chicken pad thai is my favorite. I get mine extra spicy and it's perfect! They give student discounts and have free wifi. They also give a discount if you work in that area. I eat here at least once a week. The people are nice, there is plenty of space and the food is amazing."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the feel of this place. I actually live down in Henderson, but whenever I'm on that side of town, my friends and I stop by to play games and talk.  I really enjoy the plantation milk teas and the Thai tea is great too! The staff is very kind and pretty upbeat, and over all the service and food here is really good!"}
{"text":"thai tea with boba and pad thai are really good and you get A LOT for the price which i appreciate, but the music was loud and an even louder tv was playing e3 coverage at the same time, very grating to listen to- i had to order to go and leave asap"}
{"text":"New boba place!! Whats good about this place is that their boba is on point. Meaning just the right amount of chewiness. Friend and I opted for their \"plantation potted milk teas\" since it looked so cool. I got the chrysanthemum milk tea which is actually something I've never had. I usually drink chrysanthemum tea only and I found it very intriguing in a milk tea form. In fact, I'm a little bit addicted. The milk tea had just the right amount of tea to milk ratio. Top that off with a oreo crumble and mint leaf and it looks just like a flower pot! The place is very big and they do offer a wide variety of your boba place/taiwanese snacks/meals. It is also very conveniently located right across  CSN if any students get a craving for boba. Will definitely stop by here again!!"}
{"text":"The food is great and the drinks are delicious but the fact that EVERYTIME I come here my order \"for some reason didn't make it to the kitchen\" is absolutely frustrating. I'd hate for such a good restaurant to have this kind of expectation. Honestly such a shame."}
{"text":"After months driving past their \"opening soon\" signage, today the OPEN light was on! Went in to a clean and modern space, friendly staff, and boba drinks. Food menu will be available soon with Japanese snacks and desserts.  First visit I tried the chrysanthemum milk tea with boba- the boba was just right but the tea was fairly light in flavor. BF really enjoyed it though, and I appreciated that it wasn't super-sweet as a lot of milk tea boba drinks can be.  Space is a little bare with nothing on the walls- would love to see them add games and a bit more personality to the décor. Will be back to try the spam musubi and creative-sounding desserts like marshmallow tiramisu!  EDIT 3/14: They've added paint and a bunch of flat-screens for the menu, looks better. Finally tried the spam musubi and chocolate plantation tea, rice was unseasoned and tea tasted watered-down, boba was mushy. Girl taking orders is too quiet to be heard over the college kids playing hackey sack and shouting about videogames through the door to the neighboring business. Glad they're capitalizing on the college crowd, but the lack of quality and service are a deterrent for the post-college clientele."}
{"text":"Intro: Just passing through the area with a boba craving  Cons: -boba was too hard and firm and too difficult to chew. :( major bummer  Pros: - the creativity of the plantation milk tea was very cool.  Overall: The gross boba is kind of a deal breaker for me. Sorry! Cute place though."}
{"text":"I came to this location to order boba drinks for me and my husband after stopping by at Capriotti's, with hot sandwiches sitting in the car... it took them nearly 30 minutes get me the drinks. The family who placed their order right before me, of a large order of food, had their entire order before my drinks were ready. So disappointed, I probably won't ever be coming back."}
{"text":"Was craving some boba and was hoping to finally have a close one by my boyfriend's place so we didn't have to go all the way for Tea Station, but sadly I'm a little disappointed. The atmosphere seemed really great though, just a place where you can hangout with your friends and play some board games while enjoying food and boba. However, the tea itself is bland and seems watered down, definitely not a pleaser. The tapioca is soft and sweet, so that's a small plus. I'd go back again just to kick back with some friends whilst playing board games, but probably not order their boba again."}
{"text":"I recommend getting their honeydew milk tea with boba! Super good and refreshing in this Vegas heat! Decent prices and they have a huge variety on their menu! They also give student discount which is a ++ since my college is across the street from Jackie bee."}
{"text":"Everything here is awesome from the staff, the handcrafted drinks, to the delicious food, and the many board/card/video games. I'd give more stars if I could. Show your student ID for a discount on your order."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, more than just boba, and comfortable area to just sit and relax. My first time here and I tried the spam musubi and their honey lemon and jackie bee milk tea. Very cute and nice place to stop by and right across west charleston csn."}
{"text":"I love this place. Very delicious. I love the coconut slush with boba but I now have a new favorite. That watermelon slush is so delicious. And they serve Thai food there too is a plus. Employees are very nice and I thought everything was reasonably priced."}
{"text":"There was 1 person in line ahead of me, it took 5 minutes for the counter staff to take her order.  She got it wrong twice in the process and as she was going back to the kitchen to correct it, she was told it was wrong again.  I ended up not even getting a drink because it took so long for the girl before me.  I really hope she eventually got the right order."}
{"text":"Very hot inside!!! They charge more than all the other boba places I have been to... They're okay though, no real complaints. They take their time when making them though.... A very very very long time..."}
{"text":"my favorite place for teas ! The service is really great too .  I was helped out by dielle she is so sweet!!! lol"}
{"text":"This Place is awesome Thai Bistro, Jackie Bee , and PVP. What more can you ask for . Food and game all together . Very convenient for the Gamers and also Just to eat and drink. The atmosphere is relaxed. The service is 10. Dinning area clean."}
{"text":"It was my first time there. Looked like a nice place to relax n chill.  I opted for some plantation  matcha milk tea. It was refreshing.  I decided to try the cream cheese tempura, very disappointed. It was half frozen   I'll be returning to try some of the main dishes."}
{"text":"Jackie Bee is in a prime location for students of CSN. It's a convenient boba tea house to hang out and study or grab a quick bite to eat.   I came here wanting to try their Plantation chrysanthemum milk tea because well it looks super cool!!! But it didn't only look good it also tasted really good. The staff here is awesome super kind and informative.   Of coarse I ordered the Plantation Chrysanthemum Milk tea. The barista whipped it up in no time and before your know it I had this refreshing perfectly sweeten perfectly creamy tea. The cookie topping not only looks cool but adds a cookies and cream taste to the drink when it's mixed. The boba had the perfect chew and had great honey sweetness to it. I also got the Jackie Ice coffee and man was I in love. The coffee taste was really nice and it had a Frenchy condensed sweeten milk flavor to it like a Viet ice coffee and I hate coffee.   All in all the shop was huge lots of seating very clean and chill. Prices were just right for the quality of the drinks I will now have to come back and try their food."}
{"text":"Awesome Boba smoothies. And good food also. Prices are decent. And they have alot of games you can play for free."}
{"text":"Large space with free wifi so its good for studying or to play the games that provide. The teas are okay, but every time I get boba its old/hard. So maybe stick to the fun smoothies and teas but not so much boba.  Kitchen does Taiwanese snacks and pretty legit Thai food. Food is a good value and has vastly improved!! Tom kha soup and tom yum soup are above average. Drunken noodles and the laarb are good too."}
{"text":"Being a first timer I'm not impressed. First off I'd like to say I'm from Hawaii and their musubis ARE NOT MUSUBIS! It's upsetting because it gives out the wrong impressions of what musubis are and the Japanese culture sure does not make it that way. But, moving forward I ordered the bbq \"musubi\" flavor was good...again, NOT MUSUBI it should be called sushi or roll. On top of that we ordered a taro boba which the time they had given our ordered took almost 20. Here's the thing if it's a to go place it should NEVER take that long. Reasons for me giving 2 stars is because the boba tasted good as well as the bbq roll. But please Jackie Bees please relabel musubi because that is no where near musubi and it's very misleading of what the Japanese culture has shown to the world, thanks."}
{"text":"The Thai tea was good, the cashier was friendly, the wait was too long just for drinks and they need bigger straws!"}
{"text":"The bobba here sucks. I ordered a slush and was melting before i even walked out it was all watery and extremely sweet. I tried to drink it bc me and my sister ordered a large and it was just too much we both had to throw it away after a couple sips. Gross! Poor excuse for bobba"}
{"text":"Pretty cool place to get bubble tea and more.  I thought it was just a bubble tea place but it serves Thai food and other things.  My review is based strictly on the bubble tea and not the food.   My wife ordered a large taro coconut bubble tea.  Out came this large Barney look a like drink.  I don't know why she ordered the large. We just came for lunch and just wanted something sweet.  Let's put it this way, be time we knew it, we were slurping the bottom of the cup.  Very smooth and good. Highly suggest to go here for bubble tea."}
{"text":"Great food, good prices, amazing staff. It caters to students, as far as the interior goes, it's alright. Spacious, but nothing extraordinary. Most of the staff are students and they're the reason I keep coming back. Good customer service. Definitely will recommend."}
{"text":"This place is attached to a thai restaurant now, so you can order your dinner and boba in the same place. If that sounds like a perk to you - Jackie Bee may be your new fav! It is certainly the biggest space I have seen in the bubble tea scene - there are plenty of tables to hang out at. They also rent out boardgames, just trade your ID for a game (theft problem?) I can see why the college kids at CSN may love it here, if I was in college I would certainly be back. As it is, I am not in college and I do not live near by and it isn't really good enough for me to go out of my way to get here.   For my drink I ordered a honeydew milk tea and it was rather watery. It wasn't green, which is fine with me because I would rather have it be natural and less colorful. However, it also didn't have much flavor at all. The boba was harder than I expected. I ordered the Spam Masubi and the Fried Tofu Bites. The masubi was flavorless. If you like this dish made with no spices and just warmed up spam with plain rice and seaweed, this might be the option for you. I like prefer mine with spices on the meet or sesame seeds in the rice. The tofu bites didn't come with any sauce at all - just plain pieces of tofu. Overall, eh on food and drink but home run in atmosphere and space."}
{"text":"i ordered the coconut slushie boba and i did not like it at all. it is way too sweet."}
{"text":"Not my first rodeo. Have had better boba elsewhere. (ex: No. 1 Boba (Chinatown), Teriyaki Boy (Lamb/Bonanza), Tapioca Express (Maryland Pkwy/Flamingo). Just not impressed. The consistency was as if a syrup was poured over crushed ice.   More so... ordered a spam musubi a la cart. Presentation was spectacular ... BUT Loose rice, Teriyaki taste like vinegar and the spam wasn't even warmed. Just was a sad spam musubi. I've said enough.   Pros: Student discount"}
{"text":"I ordered the popcorn chicken and milk tea. The popcorn chicken was almost inedible. The milk tea was decent, but you can find it better and cheaper all down spring mountain.  The environment was loud and dirty. Two tables next to us had half eaten food that was not cleaned up during the entire hour that I was there."}
{"text":"The boba was good and I ordered a spam masubi. Ddnt know it actually comes with more than one piece."}
{"text":"Popped in after a visit to the Magical Forest and enjoyed a couple drinks while chilling in this hip boba / Thai food spot. We tried a Thai tea with honey boba 4/5 and a mango peach smoothie with honey boba 4/5.   Interesting that they had Bill Nye the Science Guy playing on the TV and enjoyed watching a few episodes. Hilarious and surprised he was still on TV and had a show , I remember watching him for school papers back in the day.   Good drinks and cool spot with a couple couches and plenty of seating. They also have some board games you can play. Allison was a nice server and very helpful."}
{"text":"Very nice workers the place is pretty cool will be coming here often. This place looks like a great place to study"}
{"text":"Had a really good peach mango smoothie today. It's made with ice, but it's got an amazing flavor and real mango chunks on top. My fiancé tells me the milk and green teas are also great. Service is very friendly and fast. We haven't tried any of the food yet, but I'm sure we will eventually. I will update my review then."}
{"text":"Stopped by two days in a row. First I bought the taro boba smoothie. Boba was yummy, taro was ok... Too powdery. Next day I got the Thai tea boba & beef pad Thai. Thai tea & boba was really good. The pad Thai sucked. The portion size was great & so was the price. However, the noodles were super thin, choppy & very very dry!!! The pad Thai wasn't very flavorful either. & the beef was chewy & tasted weird. I will go back for the boba but skip the pad Thai. We also ordered the chicken fried rice & that was really good! We would likely get that again."}
{"text":"Jackie Bee's has the prime setup; located next door (with a connecting door and all) to a gamer's paradise, PVP Zone, a 24-hour Internet and video gaming cafe and it's also right across the street from the College of Southern Nevada. I peeped a lot of World of Warcraft action happening in the back. Good work nerds. Great location for students to post up, do homework, level up and bleed all of their allowances.  However, high hopes can't save you when the boba fails at all of your (reasonable) expectations. The menu is way too large for their own good and I can guarantee you, in a sea of mediocre, you will only find one decent item on the menu (cough: Thai iced tea- minus the boba.) Pricing is competitive: ranging from $3.50 for a medium - $5 for a large. However, they really messed up the art of milk tea and even the potted plant (plantation) tea; it tastes like dirt and water for real. The tea flavor is nonexistent; I really just tasted water, the crushed Oreos do not enhance the drink, just makes it gritty and taste dirty. Even when sending the drink back for improvement, the drink comes back tasting the same. What in the world?   The boba here is legit nasty. Like, I was actually offended with the 2 drinks we ordered. I had a look of pure disgust on my face as my drink was delivered to me with thick syrup and black mush on the bottom of my milk tea. Yeah, you guys, that's the boba. It is shockingly overcooked and gooey. Honey boba you say? Ha! Even Honey BooBoo would be offended.  The only reason why I will be nice and not give them a 1 star rating is because the kids working the counter are young and sweet, but man, they need help! Someone seriously needs to step up the leadership game. Please fix what's broken: drink flavor, quality, and dear lord - THE BOBA!"}
{"text":"The boba drinks are really good. My favorite is the taro coconut smoothie with boba. A little watered down and thin."}
{"text":"The boba here is decent, and there are a lot of flavors to choose from. I had the Jackie Bee Milk Tea with boba pearls. The texture of the boba wasn't bad: soft all the way through and not too chewy. There is a lot of space and many tables to sit at. They've even got a number of board games to play with, which is nice since it can take a little while to get your drinks. The presentation however is top notch, and every drink looks like it was meticulously made. I can definitely see myself coming back for boba or food."}
{"text":"It's okay. The boba is decent considering it is the closest boba place to my house. If you don't want to go all the way to Chinatown you can come here. The boba was al dente, but their oolong tea was sub par. They didn't steep it long enough for it to become fragrant. Their milk tea tastes nothing like it was suppose it. If anything it tasted like chocolate milk boba. I doubt I'll be coming back for their boba. Their food seems legit but I haven't had the chance to try it."}
{"text":"Reviewing again cause I love this place. Best Boba! Jackie is super sweet and the staff is great.  Try the Passion Fruit Green Tea with Boba!!!! SO GOOD  Recently got a new chef and thei food has improved very much so!! I love the popcorn chicken and the potstickers :) The fried rices are also great, as well as the yellow curry! :] Meant to post this a while ago... whoops."}
{"text":"Favorite quick, fresh and authentic Thai restaurant. Super quick service, awesome staff... love it!"}
{"text":"This visit to Jackie Bee was a bit disappointing compared to our first visit about a year ago.  We arrived just before they opened on a Sunday and waited for them to open. Service was still warm and friendly, but the drinks weren't as good this time around. We were unable to enjoy their boba because it was still cooking and wouldn't be ready for another 17 minutes, which they kindly informed us about as we were ordering. I ordered the Caramel Milk Tea and the husband ordered the Taro Smoothie.  The Caramel Milk Tea tasted slightly watered down and had a coffee taste to it. It was good, but not what I expected for a Caramel Milk Tea. My husband said his smoothie was more slushy rather than creamy smoothie. Nonetheless, he said it was perhaps one of the best tasting \"taro\" drinks that he has had of the numerous taro drinks he's tried. In all, the service is much better than the drinks (this time)."}
{"text":"Clean, modern and just a great place to hang out or study. I want to thank the guy who works there named \"Prince\". He was so polite and very friendly with his customers. The other guy who was working with him the night I came in seemed new and didn't know how to make the drinks yet. I had to return my two coconut drinks because it just did not taste right. Prince really took care of the situation, he made my drinks himself, still had a big smile on his face, still gave me great service and made my experience much better. He deserves recognition for being a great employee!"}
{"text":"Everyone was very kind.  Even though they make mistakes(well they're still humans!), they make up for it in a bigger way.  I'm really satisfied with the food as well!  The portion is so great for the price and it's delicious! We got to play their games that you can rent for free. Their plantation boba is cute and yummy! The sofas in the corner made it more comfortable for us."}
{"text":"I usually only come later in the night and even though no one is in the restaurant the staff is super nice. They joke around and make it so I want to come back. I am no expert on tea or boba so I have them make their favorites and it never disappoints."}
{"text":"Love this place !! They have a gaming room where students can just game and be online. They also awesome food from appetizers, Thai food, boba, and tea; especially since this place is next to CSN campus- it's convenient! They have clean restrooms and they show anime movies or episodes while you wait along with free WiFi . And let's not forget, that they do offer student discounts  I will always be a returning customers"}
{"text":"It's not common for me to go out for boba, and unfortunately this place made me not want to ever again...the whole experience from walking in was terrible, after ordering simple milk tea and a spam masubi it was very obvious that the employees here must have been hired from the video gaming center next door because all they did was goof around and hang out with friends coming into the store, they cared more for themselves and what food they would be eating rather than the orders the customers placed, it's not really fun watching as they walk around the entire store 2 separate times guessing which person had MY order, what's the point in giving out numbers you don't make use of them? If I had a suggestion to the managers... WATCH YOUR CAMERAS! Not only do the employees goof around while making orders, curse up a storm behind the counter and hang out with their friends on the job I overheard them tell a customer \"we get a lot of spam masubi orders and they take a long time to come out\" which is a plain lie! Anyone with half a brain could make a spam masubi in 5 minutes or less, the masubi we ordered wasn't even wrapped all the way and fell apart with every piece, I would never come to this location again unless they decided to hire a whole new staff that actually took their jobs seriously..."}
{"text":"It should not take 30 mins to make a smoothie that doesn't even taste good. Plus the boba came out hard. Horrible."}
{"text":"This place is always a hit or miss. I ordered from the Food menu. The first time I came here they had this Garlic Kimchi which was to die for and they have since changed the menu twice since I have been there that first time. I was excited to try the Crispy Lemon Chicken. Not impressed. $8 and if I wanted fried rice it was an extra 2 dollars. My chicken was mostly batter and just got a lemon corn syrup sauce spiced with 5 spice to pour over. The container was stuffed with lettuce to make it look like I was getting more. They have no fountain drinks and you have to go next door to their Gaming location and you should use cash. I was going to eat there but because of this I got it to go. Did not give any soy sauce for my white rice. I keep wanting to give this place another chance and this was my last. The flavor is not bad but I feel like I taste nothing but 5 spice and no lemon."}
{"text":"I got a mango peach smoothie with boba and mango popping pearls and it was delicious. The interior is spacious, bright, and clean and the service was fast! I will make this a regular stop for boba whenever I'm near Charleston and Torrey Pines."}
{"text":"Love it here! Went for the first time this afternoon for lunch and some boba and was so surprised how friendly the staff was! The food was good and the boba was delicious. And they have a ton of menu options. Not sure of her name, but the girl with the long reddish hair was one of the friendliest employees ever. And she brought us samples as we ate lunch. :)"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and delicious boba and food. I got the thai milk tea with boba. Highly recommended chill spot."}
{"text":"All of the drinks I've had in Vegas besides Tea Station have been the same: not enough flavor!They are very watered down compared to the drinks in LA and this place is no different!  I got the plantation taro milk tea as well as a strawberry smoothie and both had that powdered creamer flavor instead of the flavor of the drink. I wanted to like the drinks because they give discounts to students and they were very nice! I've gotten three drinks and didn't really like any of them. I got their Thai tea in a separate trip and it was average as well!"}
{"text":"Boy, looks sure can be deceiving...  Walking into Jackie Bee, you might think you're in a new modern style cafe, rather than a boba shop. Located in the Charleston Festival plaza, this new spot is open, appears clean and is decked out with decent looking furniture and several flat screen TV's. 6 of those TV's are home to the menu which features several boba drinks and a decent amount of food options, including bento boxes.  After standing around and checking out the menu for a few minutes, the girl behind the counter asked if we had been there before. We had not, so she said they had some suggestions of popular items...which ended up just being two things, the Chrysanthemum Milk Tea and the Ice-Cream Ball Coffee Jelly Milk Tea. Both seemed pretty straight forward, but she didn't bother to explain anything in anyway or offer any other help. I was also disappointed that she just offered the people in front of us a 10% discount for them just opening, but didn't mention the same deal to us. She was nice enough, but the counter service is basically nonexistent for the most part.   I ended up ordering an Oolong Milk Tea with boba and a KungPao Chicken bento box. The bento box is priced just under $9 and includes meat, a side of greens and fried rice. Going off the flavors and textures alone, nothing appeared to be freshly made. The fried rice had virtually no flavor on its own and seemed more like something you'd get out of the freezer. Unfortunately, the chicken was just as bad and had this awful flavor that tasted like burnt soy sauce. Overall it was just a really bad plate of food and I ended up not finishing it. Thankfully my drink was much better and even half price since I ordered a combo meal. The milk tea was flavorful, not overly sweet, and the boba was very decent. A little chewy, but not soggy or slimy.  My biggest issue with the drinks here is their regular teas. Our 6 year old son has quite possibly the simplest drink order you could make. He gets a plain ole' black iced tea with boba. No sweetener, no flavors, nothing...just tea and boba. When I asked the girl if they offered a tea like that, she said yes and punched his order in. Yet when we got his drink, it had this extremely strong orange flavor and was really sweet. When I took it back and asked if this was right, she said it was and that this was there house tea, but because I ordered unsweetened that's how it tastes. I was confused as she just told me the tea was plain and unsweetened only 5 minutes before that. She offered a generic apology and basically sent me on my way. I didn't bother wasting anymore money on ordering another drink.  Another strange thing about this place is their neighboring business, the PVP Zone. I'm not sure if the two are co-owned or if they are just partnering up to generate business for each other, but there is a door inside that goes between the two and people were shuffling in and out constantly. The worst part was this particular guy that I had not seen the whole time during my visit until close to the end. He came in from next door and walked back behind the counter to talk to one of the Jackie Bee employees. While that employee was making a drink in a blender, this guy was standing right next to him constantly running his fingers through his hair. I was too far away to see if anything might be coming off the dudes head, but had I seen that when I walked in, I woulda walked right back out. They let at least 2 other people from next door walk behind the counter and just hang out besides him too. With customers drinks being made in that same area, I think the owners or managers should be paying a lot more attention to who's \"hanging out\" here.  Even with the several boba spots in town, I've been waiting to check out Jackie Bee since I seen the sign a few months ago. Sadly, this was a super disappointing visit and even though the boba was decent enough, I'm not sure I'd come back anytime soon. There's way too many better choices for boba alone, and the food didn't add anything worthwhile. 1.5 stars."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. I got the strawberry lychee iced tea and it was overly sweet, I had to mix it with water myself. Be mindful that neither strawberry nor lychee is fresh, contrary to what I was told by the cashier (I think he might be referring to the slush option?). Boba is good though. 10% discount if you are a student!"}
{"text":"My first time here, staff was very friendly,  they take your order to the table. I ordered the house milk bobba tea, very good. I was bit overwhelmed with the many choices of the drinks.  I'll order something else when I come back again."}
{"text":"This place is unforgettable. The food and different drinks they strip up in the front are phenomenal. I haven't tasted anything yet to be rated 1 star. I will always recommend people to try this place :)"}
{"text":"Drinks are good. The downside is they only make smoothies in a large so if you aren't going to drink it all you are wasting money. Every other boba place in town has a variety of sizes. Also its the only one that takes 25 minutes to make a single drink when there is more than two staff on as well. They definitely need to speed up their sevice"}
{"text":"First time coming here, was excited to try it since I've heard good reviews. It was empty but walking in, the workers weren't really attentive. Took them awhile to greet me. Ordered Taro milk tea, but the server immediately took his attention off me to start another conversation with the customer behind me, assuming hes a regular. I got the total but lately showed my student ID and i\"m not sure if i got the discount because they just swiped my card without telling me the new total.   Once i got my milk tea, the color was off.. Usually its a purple color but it came out brown.. Had to ask to make sure it was the correct order. The taste was okay.. Wasn't completely mixed but i ended up throwing it away."}
{"text":"Their boba drinks is really good! Im surprised it hasnt had as much hype as any other boba places! This place is a hidden gem& I would totally recommend any of the plantation drinks (:"}
{"text":"Best teas in Vegas, & the food is tasty especially the monkey balls and the musubi's are on point"}
{"text":"Unfortunately didn't have a good experience here.  - Ordered 2 milk teas with boba, spicy popcorn chicken and spicy drunken noodles.  - Was asked spiciness level preference from 1-10.  Wanting to be more conservative, we said a 3 on the noodles and a 4 on the popcorn chicken.  -When we received our drinks, we found the tea watered down with no prominent \"tea\" flavor, so it just tasted like brown sugar water.  I also found the boba to be hard, not nice and chewy.  And for a place with \"Boba\" in the name, you should nail the boba texture.  -The biggest disappointment was the food.  The food was SO RIDICULOUSLY SPICY that it was inedible.  We heard other customers also say, \"I've never eaten anything so spicy in my life.\"  My fiancé and I love to eat spicy, so when our tongues basically became numb from a 3 and 4 out of a 10, we found it to be unreasonable.  After 2 bites of each dish, we threw the food away.  -Lastly, it was annoying to watch them play loud YouTube videos of randomness with all the ads.  We walked out saying, \"Ugh, that sucked.\""}
{"text":"Second on my top three milk tea spots in the valley. Aside from their delicious teas, their menu is pretty bomb. I highly recommend trying their Thai tea and pineapple fried rice. The two combo are my go to every time I'm here.   Very accessible, parking front and back plus it's across from the Charleston campus CSN. Wifi, plus comfortable seats and sometimes Netflix is in steaming random movies."}
{"text":"Great Tea and the Employees know the menu really well to give some recommendations if you're unsure what to try. Free Wi-Fi is a plus and its cool in the summer time. Today when I went in it was a little busy the guy told me, yet I only had to wait 3 minutes for my drink which was really fast."}
{"text":"Their smoothies are the best! I always order a mango, pineapple and coconut smoothie and it's perfect everytime. Their Thai food selections are excellent as well. The friendly staff take care of you! Good food when you're on the go!"}
{"text":"Simple, good and conveniently located. Food here is always good. Recommend giving it a try when looking for great Asian comfort food. Prefer take out than eat in given the feel of the place is more coffee shop than restaurant."}
{"text":"The food takes a little bit of time to be ready but very good. Perfect little spot to go to when you're on break from class!"}
{"text":"First time just went in for some Thai tea with boba which was good all of them taste the same to me. Seemed like a trendy cool spot so I went back to check out the lunch specials I got the Thai see wee with chicken. It was very bland not much flavor I barely ate any of it. My boyfriend got the spicy basal fried rice which was super spicy but it was okay. But I wasn't impressed at all feeling like I was forced to give a tip when paying with a CC especially when you have to keep asking for items, serve your own sauces and the staff is around hanging out and texting while there are dirty tables we couldn't sit at. Overall Thai tea was good but I wouldn't go back the rest wasn't a good impression."}
{"text":"I love how this is right across my college campus! Their food is surprisingly cheap (thank god, college budget!) (they also have a student discount) and it's in a good sized portion. I absolutely loved all the food i order from here esp. the Pad Thai! I've been here about 4 times to either study or meet up with a friend and it's the perfect place to just relax and get focused. This is also like a gaming cafe which is really cool because they're either streaming a live stream or watching movies. ALSO this place is attached to thai bistro! Kind of a really cool 2 for 1. This place is hands down going to be my hang out spot for my studying or just eating with my friends! There's also FREE WIFI here! The service here is EXCELLENT! There's a guy here who's always so helpful, attentive, and happy! The food and boba is so amazing and i'm always craving it. like this place is a dime and i'm eccentric that i found a study spot! 10/10 recommended this place!! I usually order Milk tea or Thai tea and the boba are always super soft and chewy in the center!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed coming here the past couple of times for lunch, but so far the food is good and the Thai tea is a solid 3.5/5. Not quite a \"Ooh this is good Thai tea\" unless you ask for it to have less milk. The boba is super chewy and perfect though! I make boba and Thai tea at home, so I can appreciate a place that gets it right.   I love that they have a student/military discount as I like to support those kinds of businesses, and they definitely cater to the college crowd with their gaming zone attached to the restaurant. The last time I went they were playing a Twitch livestream on the tv! The employees are decent, one of them was pretty friendly and I liked him a lot.   They have a great selection of food but for me the chicken fried rice and the cashew chicken stir fry have both been WAY too spicy to fully appreciate. The first time I stupidly ordered a 6/10 spiciness, and the second time a 4/10 was still too spicy for me to look forward to eating it for leftovers.   The level I am looking for is \"a little more than a little spicy\" and next time I will order it a 2/10 and if that's too spicy then dammit I'm throwing in the towel.   I look forward to coming back and trying other things, as the price and the value for money is good.   Also FYI if you want to do a phone order they have to run your card over the phone! So sadly I can't order in advance unless I don't want to pay in cash."}
{"text":"Conveniently located just right down the street from my new place and across the street from CSN.   I was a bit confused because when I walked in to this boba shop it turned out to be a boba shop and Thai restaurant in one. It also had an door leading to an Internet cafe from the inside. In addition they had free wifi. Perfect for a college student :)  We ordered a couple food items to go and a few boba drinks for there. Some of the food items were fried chicken and spicy and regular popcorn shrimp. The boba drinks we ordered were the Peach Lychee Iced Tea and the Honeydew Milk Tea. I rate the food and drinks 3 stars.   I added another star for KEVIN. He was great. He was friendly and service was superb. Our drinks were made quickly and while we waited for our food, the music choice was also on point. They had me singing... with feelings, the whole time! :))"}
{"text":"A regular stop for us. Limited menu, but the food is really good - the lunch specials are a really great value. Drinks, regardless of which, are always flavorful - I often ask for the cashier's recommendation for which one I should try, and they've all been hits, with no misses. The servers, etc. are all very friendly, and the ladies in the kitchen, while Lao instead of Thai, are spot on with the flavors and, most importantly, the spice level always comes as requested. I've never experienced anything that even comes close to what I might consider bad service; I've overheard some complaints and they have invariably been overly picky - people, take a look around you; you're out by the community college, not down on the Strip."}
{"text":"TLDR: Boba cafe and Thai restaurant combined, discount for students, ample study space with wifi  Jackie Bee has become a safe haven for students that want their boba fix, but don't want to travel farther than CSN West Charleston. We've eaten there a couple of times around the evening and have always been promptly greeted with friendly service. Sometimes they run out of things at night such as Thai coffee l, so be sure to come before they run out. My drinks have always been made spot on and their boba is okay. Sometimes they are older and not of better quality, but still palatable compared to most. Their plantation tea is signature and is unique to the facility.   The restaurant side has been touch and go. Most things are previously frozen and reheated. One time we had to ask their kitchen to cook the steamed dumplings longer because they were still frozen in the middle. Their soups are oily, but seemed representative of Northern Thailand-style cooking.   If you're looking a late-night place, I think you can feel safe coming here; however, if you're already in Chinatown, just stay there for food and drink."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place for groups of tea loving people. I haven't been able to get my friends to accompany me, but the board games such as cards against humanity as well as amazing black tea with your preferred flavour as well as incredible food. I expecialy love the fact that this company has the option of popping pearls in comparison to plain boba which got me back into drinking boba from a terrible experience with a mall tea shop which was made by the worker of the joint pretzel company. For anyone who would like to go with ether a group of friends, a date, or even by yourself, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Jackie Bee is my spot for boba now! I've tried a bunch of their teas, and I haven't been disappointed with any of them! My favorite one is the marshmallow tiramisu while the chocolate plantation tea falls in second. The service is very friendly on top of the food experience. I'm always greeted with a smile, the orders are taken down accurately, and the staff always shows passion in their work. I definitely recommend this place to anyone who likes a relaxing atmosphere, good food, and boba! Keep up the good work, Jackie Bee!"}
{"text":"This was honestly one of the worst boba places I have ever been to. Their customer service was awful and they took 20 mins to make two drinks. The drinks weren't even made correctly. And then when my boyfriend went to ask for them to fix the drinks she said \"well I worked hard on this drink, but I guess\". LIKE WHAT. How is that even a proper answer to fix the drink that YOU messed up. Never coming back to this place again."}
{"text":"Whenever I come to Jackie Bee it's to get a Thai tea with boba. I also enjoy the spam masubi here. There is a lot of seating, and outlets and wifi make it a good place for studying or doing homework (sometimes it can get a little loud, but nothing that a good pair of headphones can't fix). The staff is very nice and there's a student discount which is a huge plus."}
{"text":"Every time I have come in it is clean and service is amazing. Everyone is nice and personable. The food is really good as well. The spam musubi is a must try, it is a interesting new take on it with 2 different sauces. The boba is also good as well; it may not be the best in Vegas but it is good and close.  They also offer a discount for college students."}
{"text":"Awesome place to hang out with friends. Good vibes and good customer service! Across is the CSN campus and students are welcome to stay here after long hours of studying. Shoutout to PRINCE Kevin, Dielle and Edgar! Keep up the good work guys!  Tip: request for the \"spicy tofu\""}
{"text":"I'm no boba tea expert, but I do love this little place. I've tried their milk tea, green tea and rose slush with boba, and have enjoyed them all! The boba consistency seems perfect to me and I will definitely keep coming here weekly. If you like rose flavor a lot, the rose slush is amazing, but it is very sweet!  Before they had officially opened one night my husband and I tried to stop by. The owners inside actually opened the door for us and offered us a free sample! They were really accommodating and cool, I was really impressed by that.   They have a lot of board games that you can borrow and play, and it seems like it would be a fun place to hang out. The employees that I've dealt with have always been friendly and polite, and the service has always been fast."}
{"text":"The smoothies and slushies are so fresh and delicious. The service is fast and friendly. Tried the food today and the portions were large and very reasonable in price. I don't love the atmosphere because it is busy with the gamer kids from next door, but I'm just an old fuddy duddy who likes quiet. But for pick up.... I will definitely come back! It is a bit of a drive from where I live, but was worth the trip!!!"}
{"text":"It was a late night and of course, my friend was craving Tea with Boba. I live pretty close Jackie's and I did not what to travel to Chinatown. It was around 945PM and I was worried we would not make it on time, but the cashier was friendly and took our order promptly. We both had great tea and we also have some delicious chicken dumplings. They were so good that we decided to have more! Only problem is it was a little after 10PM and they were technically closed. I said if they would make us one last order of dumplings and they gladly agreed. Everything was great and they get this review for being polite and satisfying our late cravings."}
{"text":"If you know me personally then you know I love boba. I should be called a boba princess for being so addicted to boba but I will stop here. Never knew Jackie Bee Boba Express opened until my friend told me about it. Conveniently located across from CSN Charleston Campus, Jackie Bee Boba Express is a great hangout spot for college students.   ATMOSPHERE Spacious, modern, clean and most of the times quiet. Jackie Bee is located next to PVP Zone (Internet cafe), there are a lot of video game players going in and out of the stores. Even though the store can get loud at times, there are many outlets to charge your laptop while doing your homework and they even have a free wifi (password: videogame).   SERVICE Great service! Love that servers/cashiers are chill and friendly. They are willing to answer any questions.  DRINK If you are a college student, show your student ID for 20% off! With the student discount, I get my boba drink for around $3-$4. On my first visit, I got an Oolong tea with boba. I was disappointed with the taste/quality. I have gotten an Oolong tea from KFT, it did not have any strong tea taste like KFT but just a very subtle/plain taste, almost like a flavored water.   On my second visit, I ordered a Jasmine milk tea with boba (I get this everywhere I go). Jasmine milk tea here taste just like the one from QQ boba. It is very light on milk and doesn't have that overpowering sweetness. Even though I like my Jasmine milk tea floral, I really liked this version of Jasmine milk tea. I would say the only difference between here and QQ boba is that Jasmine milk tea here taste like there is soy milk in it. I no longer have to drive an hour to Henderson for Jasmine milk tea... :)  In conclusion, their drinks are good because none of the drinks have any artificial/overpowering sweetness. Subtle and just the right amount of sweetness. I do like the texture of boba here, just wondering why they would call it \"Honey Boba\" when it doesn't even taste like honey.  If you don't like boba, they also have many other options for toppings. I have not tried any of their food yet but my friend said their onion rings and popcorn chicken are really good. I will have to try those and update my review~"}
{"text":"Great place to study with lots of room and outlets. Not a good place for drinks. The tea is salty and the boba is not fresh. I'd still go back for some good studying though."}
{"text":"The boba was decent, not the best I've had but not the worst either. I tried the fried tofu and it was DELICIOUS! My boyfriend and I both thought it was yummy. There is a lot of space so it's a good place if you want to hang out. And the employees were really sweet and pleasant. If you're nearby and need a boba fix, you should go for it."}
{"text":"I'm in love with their house-brewed teas! My personal favorite is their Chrysanthemum plant(ation) milk tea. They have great lunch bites too, especially their musubis. But they are so in-demand some days they have to create a whole new batch which can take up to 20mins...worth it. It makes sense because it's right in front of CSN.   Their lunch specials are good too with just a $1.50 more for a thai or black tea to add on. Drunken noodles anyone??   Their customer service is great, they give you a number to take to a table for your order and they have games if you plan to stay for a while (just give them your id). Doesn't matter if you go in on your own or a group and plan to stay for 5 minutes or 50, chill spot to come to because who doesn't like boba?"}
{"text":"Their food Taste good and have good portion. Price is cheap and they offer student discountssssss! I came here three days a week when I visited Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I go here because it's right across the street from the college. The food is great, albeit a bit pricey, but you get a lot, and the boba milk tea is FANTASTIC! The service is always really great too, very friendly group of young people. And a 10% student discount, so who can complain!"}
{"text":"Not to our liking. It took 20 minutes for them to make a Boba smoothie and it wasn't really good. Had a funny taste to it."}
{"text":"My milk green tea was had a powder residue inside the cup, even though my drink was just milk and tea with honey boba. First impression was that the interior was very simple and the some of the girl workers were wearing animal costumes and the other were in a black tee shirt. The girl working the cashier didn't help much when I asked \"what's the most popular drink?\" She just told me they had a menu.. Okay?? Thanks. I ordered the a green milk tea and my BF got the mango slush. My boba was soft and chewy then it was hard in the middle and way too sweet. The mango slush was eh, at first it had a mango flavor for a second then it tasted like water. Whomp whomp.  It seemed overstaffed as I noticed they had one guy walking from kitchen to a his table of friends during my visit. Then I saw a group of 4 workers hanging out behind the bar and 2 people in the kitchen.. It wasn't that busy, just me and my bf and 2 other parties.  Overall I would once in awhile because I'm a CSN student who loves boba but until they improve I will stop by when I'm in desperate need to satisfy my cravings."}
{"text":"I come here a lot. I've probably been in over ten times the last two weeks.  But I really love it here. Mostly because there's  finally a boba place near by where I live.  I've also started to bring my friends and siblings over there.  It's our new hang out spot.  Edit: THE WORKERS HERE ARE THE SWEETEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD."}
{"text":"Great place. The people working here r nice. This place is clean. U can get food and they have internet/game room."}
{"text":"They have the best drink options in town. My little family and I come in as often as we can. They are always so friendly. And the food is fantastic as well. It is my favorite place in town. And when ever I ask my kids what they want to eat they all yell Jackie bees. Lol. The crunchy lemon chicken it to die for. Mmmmm"}
{"text":"I stopped at this establishment for the first time. The staff was friendly and instantly greeted me upon entering. Their knowledge of the product was great and their recommendations was amazing.    I settled on the Crispy Cream cheese Cheese & Crab Rolls  and the Chow Mein w/Shrimp.   I will visit again!"}
{"text":"got a massage at Sam's Spa and spotted Thai Food Now Open sign so stopped in. Had cream cheese/crab rolls.  Good but had more cream cheese than crab.  I ordered pineapple curry and they never turned in my order.  I finally asked what was going on and they found and placed my order.  Long wait but was worth it.  Had raspberry slush with boba; also very good.  I will return when I get my next massage and give them a second chance since I know most of the staff is new since they just opened.  Staff very friendly and food and drinks good and prices affordable so recommend this place."}
{"text":"I must've gone here on an off day.  Pros - People are nice - Clean, open seating - Inexpensive - Milk tea was fine (not great though)  Cons - I called in my order 15 mins in advance (milk tea and popcorn chicken), but it wasn't ready when I got to the store - I asked for no ice but my drink had ice in it - The popcorn chicken didn't have Chinese five spice or basil, which is what I usually expect from popcorn chicken."}
{"text":"I'm Kenneth and I am addicted to Boba. I always wanted to find a perfect place for me to hangout. Since I game a lot, I wanted a place where I can play as well. 2 months ago I found out that PVP and Jackie it was like a blessing for me. The people there are great, the computers are hella fast, and the bobas are like the best thing in the world! I WOULD RECOMEND THIS TO EVERYONE!"}
{"text":"A Place you can chill in this hot vegas summer and drink your choice of boba and smoothie drinks you can eat and even play pc games as they have a computer shop right beside it love this place i will comeback."}
{"text":"Meh, describes our experience pretty well. I had a boba drink from here a while back and it wasn't bad so when my work husband and I were craving thai food and needed it quick, going to \"Thai Bistro\" which is apparently Jackie Bee Boba, seemed rational. Ok first off, why are there two names under the same address and there is only one counter? Is this Jackie or Thai Bistro, I'm confused... Second, when ordering the food we were surprised that there was no spicy level question. I've never been to a thai restaurant that did not ask what level of spiciness I want my food to be. That should of been a red flag right there but we were starving and didn't have time. Third, our order was mixed up. We got an order of combination fried rice instead of pad thai. It's pretty frustrating to have to come back for the right order when you are super hungry. We should of checked the back before, I guess it's our fault.. Fourth, the food was just ok. We had the Pad Thai and Pad See Ew, both combination meat. Nothing special in flavor and SUPER greasy.  Don't waste your time, there are plenty of thai places around. This one just happened to be about a minute from my job. But dissatisfaction is what happens when you sacrifice convenience for quality."}
{"text":"We came in Tursday, Sept 13th '16, at approx 2:30pm  Ulises was the guy at the register, and he was super nice and friendly. He went above and beyond, and made us feel really welcome. My strawberry lemonade with boba was delicious. The ambiance was chill, trendy ( in a good way) and they played good top 40's music. Lots of cool games you can rent too (see pic). Jas was the girl that brought our drinks to our table, and she was super sweet. She wished us a lovely day."}
{"text":"Ordered the classic black milk tea w boba w less sweetener and ice. The tea tasted great but the boba was atrocious. The boba I make on my own that I buy prepackaged from the supermarket taste better. I would come here again for their beverages but not add boba."}
{"text":"Everyone is do friendly! This is one of those places where everyone working there loves what they are doing and that shows in the service and in the food. I have it had that much boba in the past so I ask them to surprise me with a drink, I haven't been disappointed, and don't think I ever will be. Today I got a drink called \"the potted plant\" which is awesome through and through, flavor as well as presentation. I am definitely going to be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"I'm rating their Watermelon Slush with Lychee Jelly.  DON'T ORDER IT!  It taste like from powder form with no real watermelon in it.  To me, any Boba place that claims a fruit drink should put real fruit in it.  Even the color is almost white, picture is true to the color; very light pink...Ugh...yuk!  Doesn't compare to ITea Boba Place.  ITea puts real fruits with their drinks.  ITea's watermelon drink is true to the watermelon color and has chunks of watermelon fruit.  TRY ANOTHER PLACE!!!"}
{"text":"Didn't expect much, just came because it was right in front of csn. The drinks are very good and the food was pretty decent! also, the service was really good the cashier was friendly and even gave a student discount!! I didn't even know until he asked me lol anyways would definitely come again!!"}
{"text":"This place was an okay boba place but it definitely wasn't the best. I wanted to like this place because it's right across the street from csn but it just wasn't up to the standards of other boba places. It's good if you have a big craving but is not my first choice."}
{"text":"delicious boba ! Employees were very informative ! I asked a bunch of questions , and they were nice and answered . I will definitely come back when I'm around that area !!"}
{"text":"Takes awhile to get boba.  I ordered Milk tea boba, pretty standard drink, took 14 minutes to get drink?  Boba was good, just not a place to go when you want to go in and out to grab a drink...    Review #2   5:00 pm afternoon on a Wednesday and they ran out Boba?  That's all I've got to say about a boba business that runs out of boba..."}
{"text":"What kind of boba spot runs out of boba? I tried to sub for chocolate pudding but they were out of that too. Apparently they were out of change as well because I received a handful of quarters. It also took over 15 minutes to get my drink. I had the matcha milk tea, it was alright."}
{"text":"I've given this place 3 tries and I'm just not sure how the ratings are so high. The food is ok but the drinks are horrible! Maybe if you're into sugary, artificially flavored drinks then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"I go here a lot to do homework and the staff is always friendly towards me. Two of the workers remember my boyfriend and I so it's really cool to have them check up on us! The milk teas are satisfactory, I never get boba in them since I hear the boba isn't that great. Obviously there are better boba shops out there but this one isn't bad at all! I always get the curries when I'm here and again, while there is better Thai food out there, the curry is not bad! I like the spice to the yellow and red curry. They always come out extremely fast and piping hot which makes me question what they're doing back there to make it come out so quickly.  The chicken is a bit rubbery and I don't enjoy the texture; I might just get tofu next time. Would've given three stars if it wasn't for the bomb staff and cool games. They have cards against humanity here!!"}
{"text":"I needed a Thai fix today so I stopped past here, hesitant about the college student feel. However the Thai sweet basil beef is better than any Thai restaurant in Vegas. Very authentic and super tasty.   Did I mention the size! Huge. Plus with a small salad. 10/10"}
{"text":"I was hungry but without appetite, asked my bf to take me here. One of the best requests I've ever made! I normally come in just for Boba Tea but today was lunch. We ordered the Thai Beef Jerky with a side of white rice and Spicy Drunken Noodles! OH! EM! GEEE! I'm such a happy camper!  I'd also like to give credit to the young man who took our orders, he's a sweetheart! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Waited 25 minutes for a spam musabi and boba slush. They ran out of boba So I ended up waiting 25 min for a slushy I could of just  gotten from sonic. They also let the food wait in the window forever instead of being quick and serving it in a timely matter."}
{"text":"I came here before teaching at CSN yesterday and really enjoyed my experience.  The shop is very spacious and the staff was super friendly.  When reading over their menu I was super intrigued by the chrysanthemum milk tea and ordered it half sweet without boba.  I really liked that you could control the sweetness levels in the drinks and there was a slight hint of chrysanthemum in my drink.  I would definitely order it again  I also ordered the Spicy Drunken Noodles with Tofu.  Normally when I order spicy foods at boba shops the food is never that spicy, but no at Jackie Bee.  There was a spicy kick to the noodles that was great.    I have a feeling that this place is going to be my new go to spot before and after working at CSN  Pros:  Come around with free samples of their menu  Have free Wi-Fi  Board games for customers to play  10% Student Discount   Con: No Posted Menu.  They only have a couple of copies on white printer paper at the counter."}
{"text":"Waited over 20 minutes for a tea! Ugh if ya can't handle the volume for the business don't let people go home in the middle of a rush  The drinks were good but clearly they just don't have the staff to handle the customers not a happy camper."}
{"text":"Got the taro milk tea with boba. The boba was good but the milk tea was a little powdery, but it had authentic taro milk tea taste which I liked. It's a cute place and very convenient location, and I'll try the Thai food sometime. Seems like a lot of people get to go."}
{"text":"The people are so nice. I ordered a Strawberry Milk Tea but since it wasn't on the menu they added some strawberry to the original Milk Tea. I didn't like it but my sister did which worked out perfectly...I asked to exchange the drink and there wasn't any hassle or gruff. Would definitely come back :)"}
{"text":"Very watered down milk tea.  When your drink has more milk than tea, it's a fail! I asked what's the difference between the regular milk tea vs the plantation milk tea, they said the plantation one has a layer of whipped cream and oreo crumbles to make it look like soil. WTF???"}
{"text":"I love their green curry and pineapple fried rice, and whatever I order the next time, ill love that as well  The boba drinks are on point, the food were fresh and tasty. Friendly service. I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"It's such a shame that I only came here as a stop on my back home to the SFV (LA) from Vegas, because I looooove this place.  For starters: the service was phenomenal. My only regret is that I didn't ask the cashier for his name, but he was very kind, helpful, and patient (He wore a beanie that day if that helps haha). I appreciate people who do what they can to help their customers.  The drinks: My sister asked if an almond milk tea could be made, and despite it not being on the menu, the cashier double checked and assured to us that he could make it. I got the Chrysanthemum Milk Tea; it's been a few days since I drank it, and I've been craving it ever since! It's not often that you find a place that sells this, and it was done well.  I personally didn't order boba and I wish I was able to (ya girl wasn't feeling it that day haha).  They sell a lot of food items here as well! I definitely want to come back. Visiting my family there will for sure give me a reason to come back :)"}
{"text":"I went there yesterday for there High Mountain Oolong Tea with Honey I definitely fell in love with my drink. I would definitely recommend coming back here."}
{"text":"I personally go here for their slush drinks, it's my absolute favorite! But every time I go they take 20 minutes (or longer) to make my drink..no matter what kind of traffic they have. Overall great place but not a fan of the slow service!!"}
{"text":"If it was a year ago i would give them 5. Now the service speed deteriorated with new staff. I could probably come in come out in 15 mins and get my honey lemon green tea a few months ago. But its almost 30 mins for a tea and it's not that busy. Where is the \"express.\" I understand if mine comes with a meal but it doesn't so theres no excuse for the speed. I cam here since opening and I know if its taking a while."}
{"text":"Jackie Bee Boba Express is a cute little boba place on the west side right across from the CSN campus. I would honestly give this place 3 1/2 stars, but gotta work with what I have! It's connected to a Thai restaurant and a LAN center too. They have a build your own slush/smoothie option which I chose. Heads up - if you're gonna build your own slush or smoothie, it only comes in a large size. I ordered a taro/oreo smoothie with boba. It was pretty good, the smoothie was thick and not watery. And they gave a proportionate amount of boba. This place also has a few board games and card games for their customers to play with. The staff is very nice. They can tell if you're new to this boba place and are willing to explain their menu and offer you recommendations. While this boba place isn't amaaaazing and wouldn't be my personal first choice if I was craving boba, I'd probably still come back to it if I'm ever in the area."}
{"text":"Every time I come here, which is really frequently, at least once a week since it is right by my house, the service is excellent. Everyone is crazy nice and accommodating and I have loved everything I have eaten/drank. Though I will say they are fairly inconsistent on their sushi. I have gotten the same spicy crab roll 3 times and the first time it was amazing, the other 2 times was decidedly meh. I am addicted to this place due to their service, quality of product, and location. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Great staff but they take a long time to make one drink! Over 10 mins for 1 drink! I ordered a taro boba slush. Really helpful and nice staff but all they were doing is talking and once they were done talking then they made my drink.  On top of everything the boba wasn't good."}
{"text":"Came here and ordered two lunch specials they got my order wrong I substituted chicken for shrimp and paid extra and still got chicken...which I didn't eat. they gave us a coupon for a free drink because of their mix up so we ordered a slushee before we left: then they forgot about our slushee and proceeded to make everyone's orders that came in after us except ours .. we reminded them and they still forgot. Never waited for a drink this long in my life . We won't be back :/"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. The workers were all friendly and very sociable. We came in around 10pm. Sat down and was looking at the menu. It was very long and printed on computer paper(5+pages and stapled together) so there were a few stains. So many choices we felt lost. So a worker came and sat by us and gave us a few recommendations.   The food was good but the drinks we ordered were super sweet. I got the peach tea boba. It was probably one of the sweetest boba drinks I ever had. I was only able to drink half.   Location is great. Right across of CSN."}
{"text":"Their workers are very friendly, and their service is fast. Their boba is great, and they have games for people to play at their tables. I will certainly come back with friends!"}
{"text":"yum!!!' So good and fun atmosphere! Did I mention they offer games?? Love love love this place!"}
{"text":"Staff didn't make my milk tea correct.    I ordered milk tea-no boba with less ice.  When I got it,  it was warm and wasn't sweet. I even watched him do a taste test to see if it was \"good enough.\"...   They didn't even have the spill proof cups or machine to seal the top with plastic.  I had a large cup and lid like at Starbucks.  (Found out they're a new business as of three months)   I asked for them to remake it after a few sips and the warmth from the beverage was just weird. They did it without hesitation.  Maybe it was a employee, so another guy stepped in and made it for me.    I got the other drink and it was a little better.  But I would not go here again.    Price was cheap though.  $3 and some change with the student discount.  Gave a dollar tip at the register.   Overall,  disappointed product,  but the atmosphere was good.  Roomy and lots of space to study and kick it.    One star for a decent* remade milk tea.   One star for cozy atmosphere.   One star for cheap price.   Overall-ehh."}
{"text":"I love coming here because they have really good service. I just wish that the food had a little bit more spices to it!"}
{"text":"The only complaints I have is that it seems a little understaffed and that they blast music way too loud and with way too many non-family-friendly words. Other than that, the pricing and quality is great."}
{"text":"Omg... worst popcorn chicken I've ever had. I've had 2 pieces and I can't even finish it. I'm disappointed, but at least service was good & friendly."}
{"text":"Jackie Bee is like my high school/ college dream come true.... I mean, you can get boba, shaved ice desserts, \"Thai food\", and  borrow board games!!! It's the perfect nerdy hangout spot!  Sadly, the boba itself is pretty bad - it was mushy and tasteless and overall very disappointing. Tea is okay, nothing special. I also ordered noodles, which were more chow fun than pad se ew, but was pretty decent and fresh.   Big clean space. Super friendly service.   Tips:  +10% student discount and 10% hospital discount + You must be 18yrs or older to borrow Cards Against Humanity...LOL"}
{"text":"Kinda sad about having to give this rating but to put it super blunt, the drink sucked.  I ordered the matcha milk tea, friend ordered the honeydew milk tea. I got mine with boba.  The service was 5/5 stars. The staff was SO friendly, they explained the menu to me as it was my first time being there and all the hot foods that they served as well as any specials they had.   I got my marcha milk tea pretty quick, the boba was alrighty the drink was a total mess. First sip the worst sigh of disappointment that I've had in a while.  Since my friend and I were mainly there for the study space and wifi I didn't care to order another drink.   Once again staff was super cool, asked us if everything was alright-- it wasn't but whatever. Matcha milk tea tasted like sugar water with a dab of green food coloring. No matcha flavor at all. Super disappointed.   Friend also super disappointed in her honeydew drink, I tasted it, it definitely smelled like honeydew but upon trying it just some more sugar water.   Struggled to finish my drink but gosh darn it I paid for it so I did it. Thanks Jackie Bee but I won't bee coming back :c"}
{"text":"Best boba in town, I come here often for a Thai tea Boba.. Amazing ... They have really good food, with a great selection..."}
