{"text":"If you haven't been to Jocko's Bar and Grill lately, you owe it to yourself to go. It is the same great sports bar - big and open with plentiful well-located flat screens, and upbeat friendly service - but there's something new. The CHEF and the MENU!  Jocko's kitchen is now powered by Chef Charles, who comes straight from Fahrenheit in Tremont. This young, talented chef who was mentored by none-other-than Rocco Whalen, has elevated typical bar food to a culinary experience. The food is simply delicious, with complex flavors and a special attention to detail that makes a statement. We went in a few weeks ago and so enjoyed our entrees that we went back and ordered the exact same dishes. (Next time we will be sure to venture further into the menu because there are a wealth of choices!)  I had Four Cheese Blend Tortellini with abundant, sauteed vegetables and basil cream sauce (skipping the shaved pancetta since I'm a vegetarian). Savory and so creamy with large, perfect al dente Tortellini. Along with the bites he kept stealing of my Tortellini (!), he enjoyed an 8oz. Pan Seared Salmon accompanied by edamame mashed potatoes, garlic spinach, and wasabi aioli. Not only was it delicious, healthy and beautifully plated - it is priced so reasonably that you could go there and have it every day for dinner.  With the addition of Chef Charles, Jocko's is bringing some amazing food to Broadview Heights. The owners' vision and his culinary leadership have taken Jocko's from 'bar food' to 'dining' in a sports bar setting where you feel right at home."}
{"text":"Great food. Some of the best burgers around.  Everything is fresh and well prepared.  We come in for the nightly special frequently.  Lucky to have Jocko's so close."}
{"text":"the decor is typical sports bar but the food was elevated sports grub~went on wednesday which is taco nite, I tried the braised chix taco, poached shrimp taco, lobster salad taco and steak taco~they were all delicious with complex flavors. my husband ordered wings and although the wing was big and meaty the sauce was lacking.  The most important part of a wing is amazing sauce and they need one here.  The sandwiches and burgers looked amazing and will come back to try other options on the menu."}
{"text":"Jocko's was a great surprise yummy dinner!!! ALL I'm saying is that I had no idea the food was going to be so good. I had this unique grilled cheese sandwich. IT was like no such grilled cheese sandwich ever though.... (I should have written this review sooner for memory)... but I know it had brie (or was it gouda), and apples and some kind of homemade strawberry jam...and something else but it was the mix of it all in a bite that was YUMMY GOOD.  The burger was delicious too... my friend had a double...and if you're a meat eater, this is your burger! Two full burgers... no slim pickens here!   We'll be back for sure! Service was friendly and welcoming!!"}
{"text":"I've lived in Broadview Heights for about 10 years now. Jocko's Bar & Grill is a rebranded bar and grill--it was previously Doc's Bar. I was prompted to check out Jocko's because I've been unhappy with the selection of fast take-out food in the area. I'm sort of a hard person to please when it comes to restaurant and bar food. The reason being that there is no consistency to what is served. While Jocko's still has a lot to prove to me regarding consistency, the quality of food that I received is promising.    One of my favorite bar foods are chicken wings. My wife considers me to be a wing fanatic, which I'll agree is true. I tried two different wing flavors yesterday (Friday, May 6th): Hot Garlic and Wet Cajun. Both were cooked perfectly but I liked the Wet Cajun the best--I probably won't order the Hot Garlic again because it lacked the main ingredient which is GARLIC! If you knew me well, you'd know that I love garlic--lots of garlic.    Jocko's also has a happy hour and the drinks are more reasonably priced than some of the other restaurant/bars in the immediate area. The atmosphere is comfortable and the bartenders are attentive and friendly. I think I've found a new watering hole!    Since I'm a tough grader, I initially gave Jocko's a 3 out of 5 but will revise this review after I've frequented them a little longer. Like I said, the quality of food is promising."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem.  Excellent braised chicken nachos. Fresh, succulent, tender pieces of braised chicken and fresh veggies and cheese. You should share with at least two people if you're getting it as an app.   Excellent breads on their sandwiches. I've had the French Dip, the oyster po-boy, bacon grilled cheese and the braised pulled pork. They're all good. Love the crispy fresh cut fries."}
{"text":"Wow, I was so surprised to find food this good in a sports bar in Broadview Heights.  The Wife, my friend Lynda and myself settled down one Thursday night because we had read the reviews of other yelpers who were similarly surprised by the quality of the food served here.  They are not wrong.  While there are the simple, sports bar type foods, there were also a number of foodie type choices.  We got the shrimp po boy (delicious), a grilled gouda cheese sandwich with green apples and a tasty strawberry jam (wonderful) and split a potato skins entree appetizer w/ creme fraiche and short ribs.  It was amazing.  I briefly considered eating the entire plate and probably will do this the next time I will be there.  Which will not be long.  Great place- good service and prices were reasonable.  Rock on Jockos!"}
{"text":"1st time here with some friends for dinner.  7:00 on a Friday and 6 of us were able to get a table right away.  All of us ordered tall beers and were told they were out of tall glasses.  What!!!  This is a bar is it not...on to the food.  I had the Jock Strap burger -- huge 8 oz burger with bacon, cheddar, onion straws, and BBQ sauce along with your choice of fresh cut fries or home made chips (had to take half of it home).  My husband had the chicken mac & cheese.  Both dishes were delicious, hot, and plentiful -- very good portion for your money.  Server was efficient, but not very personable.  All in all, we will definitely be back!"}
