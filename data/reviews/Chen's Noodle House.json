{"text":"The taste is awesome of the Mala noodle soup, the portion is good for that price.  The lamb one can be improved if they can, I think the topping is not enough to go with the noodle.  My son loved the Wonton soup, tasted fresh and home made. It's clean and neat, our family Will try it out another time."}
{"text":"This restaurant should not be recommended. The waiter and waitress here will not care your feeling. They just give you food leave. If you give their bad feedback, they will even to threaten you"}
{"text":"The food is delicious at a great price. And the people are courteous. A great place to eat."}
{"text":"Been here once and had a great time, not to forget to mention the spicy chicken noodle soup was tasty  The chicken was tender and the broth was a nice balance of savory and spice! My siblings think it was really spicy, but they may just be weak with it. Zack, our server, was very chill and engaging. It was as if he was having lunch with us. If you're looking for a cool, authentic place to dine at I'd recommend Chen's. It is a little more expensive than what I'm used to (by a dollar or two more give or take, but still!). That won't keep m from coming back tho"}
{"text":"I forgot to take a picture before I started, but the contents of my bowl should explain enough. Simply awesome. Recommended definitely."}
{"text":"Kinda surprise to see this place even has a 2.5 star. This restaurant sucks plain and simple. The food quality can always be improved, but bad waitress would be the deal breaker. A little bit of hipster attitude is okay in my book, but redness? No way!"}
{"text":"Beef noodle soup tastes like shit in here. Some beef were still freezing and bloody, not even eatable. I will never go again!!!"}
{"text":"They have the best wonton in town!! And the noodles are also very very tasty, excellent for people who love spiciness!!"}
{"text":"Noodles are pretty good, but the barbecue skewers and Chinese sir fry dishes are my favorite! Prices are fair and the food is the bomb!"}
{"text":"Great variety of authentic Asian food.  Their soups are especially delicious with a variety of meats and infused broths with great taste.  Their fried rice was a bit on the fishy side and their website and ordering process was hard to use."}
{"text":"Too oily too salty and the service attitude is bad. And moreover, they put vegetable underneath the pork. I ask them why you did this? Cuz vegetable are totally melt into oil, they said it is for decoration. How hilarious?! I said if it is for decorating, why it is on the bottom instead of on the top. It is non sense. Their attitude is terrible."}
{"text":"The hands down best hot pot I've ever had!! Spicy and incredible. My son and I loved it."}
{"text":"What a great, undiscovered little gem. Kind of hard to find, but worth it.  I'm not a huge fan of the food behind the counter, but love the menu's food. Some really good stuff.  One note of caution: they aren't kidding when they say \"spicy\" on some dishes. Tons of stuff without spice, but just be aware that the spicy stuff is for the more adventurous.   We'll be back again!"}
{"text":"If you love Sichuan style dishes, definitely give this place a try! The owners are so friendly and the food is the most authentic Sichuan noodle place I've been to in the Arizona area so far. The prices are great for the noodle menu (can't speak for the other menu since I haven't given it a try yet) around $10 for a huge bowl - I leave way too full every time!! The last time I went there were quite a few parties that were eating hot pot and it looked delicious!! Definitely going to come back to give that a try!!"}
{"text":"Food: Great portions and food was spicy in a good way! I eat a decent amount of Chinese food but I've never had Chinese hot soup noodles like this before. I got Soup Noodle with Ma La Beef. The broth had very interesting flavors that were new to my tastebuds.   Price: Appropriate  Atmosphere: the restaurant looked very clean and neat. There are also tv's.   Service: I only went in to get takeout so I can't comment on tableside service but I will say that as soon as I walked in, 2 employees greeted me immediately with smiles and welcomes! A older gentleman (perhaps Mr. Chen?) rang up my takeout order and was so smiley and sweet. He came from behind the counter to give me my food :)"}
{"text":"The food comes out really fast. Beef was tender and tasteful. The rice noodles I ordered was really chewy This portion was great and the price was reasonable! Nice place to take a quick lunch and dinner"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Love this place. The food is tasty and delicious. Love the Szechuan spicy numbing flavor."}
{"text":"* LIKELY FOOD POISONING ALERT* Would give zero (0) stars if I could. Pretty sure had mild case of food poisoning from Chen's. From out of town, we stumbled up this place after seeing a few good reviews. Had the TW beef noodle, found the meat touch and certainly not stewed to a palatable tenderness. Soup base on the salty side, tells me that rather than slow stew with beef and bone, chef opted to season (salt or worst yet, soya sauce) the soup for taste. Buddy and I both had noodle soup and had terrible stomach issues the morning after. Service was decent and place was generally clean. Despite all that, getting food poisoning leaves serious issues with food handling in the back. Never going back."}
{"text":"I would highly recommend Chen's noodle!! This place is outstanding in Tempe! This is the most authentic tasting noodle place I know of in AZ. Very very good. I would even compare this place to something in LA. It's that good!"}
{"text":"Delicious rice noodle soup and spare rib kebab! I'm so excited they opened in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"The worst service i have ever see.  The courier has bad attitude. Just saw a comment before that if you give not full score to this restaurant you will be threaten by them. Anyway DO NOT choose this disgusting restaurant"}
{"text":"Went there with my wife last Saturday, we ordered Huaxi beef noodle soup, Sour soup fish, and Oil fried Shrimp. The beef noodle soup is authentic style and aromatic to me. We also finished up the sour fish completely, which is a little spicy. Generally the foods are traditional south-west China flavor. It is close to ASU so we saw a lot of students there."}
{"text":"Noodles are good! Will come back again especially for the homemade meat bum! It gives me the taste of homeland :P"}
{"text":"Went to Chen's Noodle House and didn't know what to expect.  I immediately thought the decor on the walls were cute and thought the restaurant smelled good. It was pretty busy for being 10 pm and a new restaurant, I was excited.  I ordered the Taiwanese beef noodle soup because it's one of my favorite foods from Taiwan. (Order it with the egg noodles)   I thought the soup had good flavor, but it wasn't strong and tasted a little watered down. The soup was also too spicy for me. I can handle mild or medium spice, but my lips are still burning 45 minutes later haha. Maybe I'm not as strong as I think I am, but I do think it was a tad too spicy because I've never had it that hot/spicy in Taiwan.    Overall, the flavor was good but needs to be a little less spicy!   The table next to me ordered hot pot which looked really good. I would definitely return to try something else    Took off 2* for the spiciness and flavor of the soup. I couldn't finish half of it since it was too spicy"}
