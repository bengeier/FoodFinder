{"text":"I really do like their pizza but they've now lost me as a customer. I ordered from their website last week and after an hour they called from my old address. When I placed the order online I gave them the address to deliver it to. Tonight at just after 10 I again placed an order through their website, after an hour I called to see what was taking so long this time. What was taking so long was the fact that they closed at 10 but don't list it ANYWHERE on their website nor do they have a script to stop order placement at 10.   It's simple things like this that turn customers into former customers."}
{"text":"The first night in town I ordered and 18 inch 12 cut Conqueror pizza. I'm a huge carnivore so I ordered the Godfather, I also ordered the bread sticks with the garlic and cheese sauce rubbed on the outside. Delivery time was good, and the breadsticks were good.  However, although the pizza itself tasted good there were toppings that were burnt. I called back and spoke with the owner and this arrogant sob never apologized for anything. His comment to me was \"this is the way we've always done it and we've never had one complaint\".  I said it's not that the pizza wasn't good some of the toppings were just burnt. He refused to acknowledge the situation and brush me off as if to say, you're from the hotel, you're a temporary guest and you don't matter to me at all.  The pizza was good enough to try again so, the next night I decided to try the Chicago style, thinking that all the ingredients that can burn would be inside the crust and underneath the cheese and tomato so nothing will burn.  Although nothing was burnt all of the toppings were on top of the cheese like a regular pizza as if it was New York style or Sicilian style. I spoke with the driver and ask him if this was their version of Chicago pizza. ( I've never experienced Chicago style pizza before but I was looking forward to trying it). After examining the pizza he informed me that he would not have prepared a Chicago style pizza in that manner. Still, the pizza was tasty. So, once again on Friday, the next night, I decided to try again. I was still working and there was a snowstorm coming in so I called ahead and ask if they were going to be delivering that evening and if so would they be closing early. I was informed that they are going to remain open the regular hours for a Friday night i.e. delivery  11 p.m.. around 10 p.m. I decided to order and not wait until later so I called to place my order but they were already closed. They knew who I was because they had my phone number and, I asked the person answering the phone to call me if they were going to close early.  He said that was not a problem. But there was no phone call  so I ordered food elsewhere. I called tonight ( Saturday ) because I wanted to try the Chicago style in the large size to see if it was like I've seen on the food network. When the person answered and ask for my order I asked him if he was the owner and he acknowledged that he was and that he knew who I was through my phone number. I placed my order and he said to me let's make sure this is the exact order that I wanted because I had complained the last two times I ordered. All I asked the second time, to the delivery driver, if this was or was not an authentic Chicago style pizza. So when I explained to him that I had no problem with the pizza and that I had just never had a Chicago style pizza and it didn't look like what I saw on Food Network he just brushed me off. So I brought up that the only time I wasn't happy was when he would not acknowledge when he burnt the toppings on the very first pizza and he was still a jerk about it. The only reason I'm still ordering pizza if because it is good and the employees that work there are very nice but the owner is an ass hole"}
{"text":"I love this place. They have the best gourmet pizza's around. Now I am not saying this is the best pizza in the burgh, but this one is way up there, only because they have so many great kinds of pizza. Plus the pizza is good and its made in house its not frozen shells which so many places use, and that's why so many places suck. Everything I have ever tried there is good, sandwiches, apps, everything."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Pizza shops in the North Hills. Try the steak ranch pizza or any specialty pizza they have, they are amazing. With over 20 different specialty pizzas I believe it is hard to pick one. They also have great hoagies as well. Well run mom and pop pizza shop, not your typical chain pizza shop. Highly recommended. Great prices as well."}
{"text":"We ordered food from Adrian's a few nights ago. After paying over $30 for a small pizza, ziti, and some breadsticks, we were hoping for a good meal.   The food was awful! I took two bites of my rubbery ziti before throwing it out. They also screwed up our order and sent a salad instead of wings. The girl who took our order was talking to someone else the entire time, so it's no wonder that it was messed up.   Bad food, messed up order, and FAR too expensive!"}
{"text":"This pizza shop is best in North Hills for take-out and delivery. I get their Gyro's for lunch, so good with sour cream and chives. My favorite pizza is gourmet vegetarian but all of their specialty gourmet pizza are so good as they use real mushrooms, tomatoes, zucchini, and artichokes!!!  Their pizza is never burnt or cold on delivery compared to their big competitor promising fresh. Adrian Pizza is never overcooked and dried out like big competitor at Pines Plza."}
{"text":"Keeping secrets isn't nice. So, I am spreading the word about the so-called \"secret pizza\"! And the word is: Mmmmm. This pizza is damn good!  There is no visible sign from the street. If you don't know Adrian's is there, you'll drive right by. Luckily, I live half a block away, and I walk my dog past Adrian's daily! From the exterior, I'll admit, it looks sketch at best. There's a large gravel driveway that appears to be shared with the houses/apartments nearby. In fact, it kinda looks like Adrian's is housed in someone's garage.   The interior is equally unimpressive. It's hot. There's a lot of grey cement. And, the other reviews about unfriendly service? Oh yeah. They're right. BUT, my thinking was: Yelpers all raved about the food. Complaints were only about service. Us the pizza so tasty that Adrian's can still survive, sans attitude adjustments? I had to find out.  My boyfriend went for a classic pepperoni pizza. It was awesome. The crust was dense and doughy, and, in my opinion, the perfect middle ground between thin and pan. The sauce was slightly sweet, not overabundant, and seasoned well. Plenty of cheese, and high quality pepperoni, too!  I opted for the steak ranchero pizza - one of their many 'specialty' pies. It was freaking awesome. Their white sauce lent a nice buttery, garlicky flavor, they didn't skimp on cheese or shaved steak, and there were plenty o' fries on the pizza, too!   I'll definitely be back to try the pierogie pizza, and the Archy - steak, white sauce, mashed potatoes, cheese, and... excuse me, I'm drooling.   Nice selection of hoagies, calzones, strombolis, pastas, appetizer-ish finger food, and more. I foresee Adrian's becoming my go-to pizza place!"}
{"text":"Best pizza, period. Try the Mediterranean pizza if u like white pizzas. Used to deliver this pizza for yrs at Pearl St. and different stores. The choices allow you to have a different pizza everyday of the week for two weeks. If your truly adventerous try the peroigie pizza. All traditional pizza lovers you can't go wrong, ask for it well done and you'll never want anything else but Adrians pizza."}
{"text":"The pizza here is good.  The many crazy toppings and specialty pizzas they have add lots of variety to the standard fare.  I recently split a conqueror (XL) with my roommate and was able to feed myself for a whole day for $7.50.   However, their customer service leaves something to be desired as many other reviewers have mentioned.  I have never had any huge problems myself, but based on their overall attitude, I assume the 1-star reviewers are not alone in their bad experiences.  In general, if you are someone who is pretty easy-going and isn't easily upset by poor service or are willing to sacrifice great service to save some money, then I definitely recommend it.  They have online ordering and menus as well."}
{"text":"I called and ordered a pizza for pickup.  The girl on the phone let me know about the specials they were having and I got a large pizza, breadsticks and coke for $13.  The pizza was ready in 20 minutes.  It tasted good, was cheap and was ready quickly.  No complaints at all!"}
{"text":"I keep returning to Adrian's because I have had some great pizza from there.  However, they are extremely inconsistent, both in their service and in their food quality.  I am a creature of habit and order the same pizza all the time.  I never know whether it will have lots of delicious fresh toppings, or it will be disappointing.  When I order through allmenus.com, they have sometimes delivered my food in 20 minutes.  On other days, they totally forgot my food, (\"we didn't get the fax;\" \" we opened late because of my kids' soccer game\",) or they called me several hours later and asked if I still wanted the order ( \" a new kid was working.\" )  \"I'm late because I was picking up supplies.\"  Don't order drinks from them, because they seem to not know the difference between Coke and Diet Coke.  I have never been offered any compensation for any of these errors.  After reading this, I think I will try other places."}
{"text":"The food: I ordered a grilled chicken salad...here's what I liked, the grilled chicken was shaved. It was very thin which I loved!! The dressing was good. Nothing special, but good. Things I did not like...the cheese was rubbery, and the tomatoes were terrible.  (which I would forgive in winter but not in the summer) I was able to remove the cheese and tomatoes and add my own at home so all in all, not bad and reasonably priced.  The service:  I walked in and no one said hey, hello, or anything to me.  As a matter of fact a man walked right past me and looked but said nothing. I waited (thinking to myself, \"you should just leave...they don't care that you are standing there\") and finally the guy who walked past me came back. He very miserably took my order and walked away. I'm not sure if he was so incredibly unhappy because it was like 200 degrees in there or if he had just gotten some very terrible news.   If you enjoy being greeted in a welcoming manner and customer service is important, I wouldn't recommend this place at all! There are a thousand pizza shops in the area."}
{"text":"Best pizza & subs in North Hills. Super nice crew and the food can't be beat. Unique menu. We don't order from anywhere else now."}
{"text":"She wanted to have pizza and I suggested we try this place rather than our usual go-to pizza place. I ordered a Sicilian for pickup.   It was ready when promised, and was right out of the oven.  I did not care for this pizza. It might have been cut into squares like a Sicilian but it wasn't what I expected from a Sicilian style pizza. This had a thin doughy crust with zero crunch other than the edges, and a too-sweet tomato sauce with no garlic.  No issues with the staff.  I have friends who like the pizza from here but I never asked if they had a Sicilian - perhaps the more traditional pies are better."}
{"text":"Recently ordered \"extra large pizza\". I am a regular customer. Ordered \"Mediterranean  \" style. Pizza was inedible- undercooked and soggy. Because of dairy allergies had requested half with no mozzarella nor provolone. Pizza had full cheese.  Called and talked to owner. He offered a \" small pizza\" if we reordered within one week. I explained my guests had left and would prefer just a refund.  He refused and stated\" you authorized payment and I have your money.  Amazed that owner would believe holding onto my $33.00 more important than losing a regular customer.  Of course, there are dozens of pizza option in the Shaler area so can only spread the word to frequent those instead."}
{"text":"Don't let the lack of decor fool you. This restaurant must put all their care into making their food delicious, and helping their customers feel well cared for and well fed. The new owner always has a smile and gracious disposition. And honestly, they have the best wings I have ever tried."}
{"text":"I had heard great things about the pizza here so I had to try it. We pulled up and the guy working was hanging out in front and decided to walk back in as we parked. We walk in and grabbed a menu as he started to make dough. He saw us standing there but ignored us for over ten minutes. When he finally acknowleged us we ordered a Brontosaurus Pizza and he said \"Oh, we don't have corned beef or roast beef anymore.\" Really? He didn't look to clean either. So we left and got a great pizza at Rivertowne Inn."}
{"text":"Best known to a lot of people as \"secret pizza\".  They have great prices, awesome gourmet pizza pies, and their wraps are pretty good.  Not a big fan of their wings, but when I'm craving pizza... this is the first place i call for delivery!"}
{"text":"I live and work in the area forever but  had not tried Adrian's pizza until a few months ago. I have been back at least once a week since! The food is awesome! I'll stop in for A quick lunch and take care of some work and use the WI-FI. They have really good daily specials. Salads are huge. The house made balsamic is awesome. And the pizza! OMG. First of all they put all kinds of crazy things on pizza like mashed potatoes and French fries. Each one I try is better than the last. Cyprus is my entire families favorite pie.If you haven't tried this place recently you need to stop in! The new owner is truly passionate about what he does. He is there every time I stop in. Almost forgot... He makes homemade soups. So fresh and delicious. If he had the tomato zucchini I highly recommend it. His wedding soup and chili are also really good!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite pizza in the North Hills, hands down.  We order almost once a week which I'm a little embarrassed to admit.  Their specialty pizzas are awesome - my favorite is the Winters green.  Yum.  The TRex is another specialty we order often.     Delivery times are super fast.  The guys who answer the phone are friendly and polite and never sound annoyed when you call (I swear that's a pre-req at every other pizza joint) even when you can tell they are extremely busy.    If you get on their text list they send great specials out often. We take advantage - again, more than I'd like to admit - we eat a lot of pizza.     No one in this area is better.  I've turned many a friend onto Adrians of Ross and they all agree.   Eat this pizza!!"}
{"text":"This is a solid little pizza place. They have the most amazing breadsticks and the best ranch dressing I've ever had. No eat in, but that's ok since they have fox news on the TV and I can't watch that."}
{"text":"I adore the white pizza with spinach, tomatoes, feta, & onion. It is the best ever. Great food! Never disappointed!"}
{"text":"Seems the Mazzotta family are all rude and beligerant. I have been treated poorly at this location in the past as well as the Adrians in gibsonia. Steer clear of their rudeness and eat better food. Apparently the customer is never right with this family and chain of low class pizza places."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this pizza place. Their chicken parm pizza is amazing I think my husband may like it more than Frank's buffalo chicken pizza! They are also one of the few places that have green olives and I love green olives on pizza. Their wings are ok, the mild wings don't have much flavor."}
{"text":"We love the pizza and wings! Anytime you're at North Park, stop in for their deluxe pizzas. Our favorite is the Bacon Chicken Ranch! Yummmmy"}
{"text":"One of the first things a person needs to know when moving to a new city is where to get good pizza. After reading the reviews, I decided to try Adrian's. I gave my order and with in the promised 30-45 mins, the pizza was at my door. At first bite, I realized this is no ordinary pizza. It was truly amazing. I'm glad I found my new pizza place on the first try. (the only reason I'm giving this only 4 stars is that it cannot compete with my fav back home, but it certainly comes really close.)"}
{"text":"Their pizza selection is Huge, and I have enjoyed the ones we have tried thus far.  Salads are a good size with lots of toppings! Had the Cajun chicken salad last night and the seasoning/sauce on it was delicious!! Can't wait to order from there again!"}
{"text":"Fantastic, this place or should I say, location has grown very far in the quality of their food, the staff is very kind, and polite, today we just had a Large pizza Wings and bread sticks to go once again everything was perfect we live in the neighborhood and have been eating here at least twice a month since they opened.. Never had a bad meal here yet. Food is always ready around exact time that they tell you. I and my family love this place prices are very very reasonable."}
{"text":"Okay, its pizza.  But its good pizza.  The place is tiny and kind of easy to miss.  Not elegance.  Great takeout though.  Accurate order for a phone in and prompt when I arrived to pick it up.  Pizza was plenty hot, crust was just about right, and the sauce was (according to my preteen pizza connoisseur) \"quality.\"   We had the pepperoni and sausage; will order again."}
{"text":"Best Pizza Delivery in the Burgh (or McCandless)?  Since moving to McCandless, searching for that perfect pizza delivery place is hard.  I have tried a ton of places and I tried this one today.    I had alot of people at the house and someone made this suggestion.  We called and ordered three of large pizzas with one topping each.  The told us delivery would take 45 minutes to an hour.  The delivery only took about 40 minutes.  The pizza was good but not great.  The fact it was delivered timely and hot would make me try them again.  The pizza is a very thing crust and had enough cheese on it.  If you like thin crust pizza this may be the place for you.  Great place for fast delivery and ok pizza."}
{"text":"The chicken and broccoli pizza is delicious!! I ordered carry out and had no problems. There were nice guys running the place and I thought it was a pretty good price considering how loaded the pizza was."}
{"text":"I stopped by here last night to pick up a pizza for dinner.  I  had called in my order for a large cheese pizza at dinner time and was quoted a time of 15 minutes until it was ready, so I guess they weren't really that busy.  It took me a bit longer than that to get cash and get there and lo and behold my pizza was waiting.  There is not much to say about the appearance of this Adrians as it has dark windows on the outside and the inside is just big enough for you to get in, stand at a counter and pick up your pizza.  To be fair though that is all the space really needed.  Whenever I opened up my pizza the first thing that I noticed was how small it was for a large.  It was maybe 12\"-14\" and reminded me of the mediums from a bunch of pizza chains. The taste of the pizza wasn't too bad as it had a decent amount of good tasting cheese on top of it.  What confused me was the sauce as I was trying to make sure to take note of it and on a few bites it was a bit spicy, another few a bit sweet but most of the time it was just there and had no real redeeming qualities.  The same can be said for the crust as it was there but it wasn't crispy and I never took too much note of it.  The bottom line for me is that I might stop back here again in the future but only if I have another 50% off coupon.  The pizza that I had seemed small and not very well conceived and I probably would have been happier it I had stopped for a $5 special at other places or made a frozen one in my oven myself."}
{"text":"So delicious!! There are so many awesome gourmet pizzas to choose from. Great service, great food! I absolutely recommend this place. We had the fried ravioli and j-bombers for appetizers and ordered the Pterodactyl pizza and the Ranch Steak pizza. They also make their own dough all day long. You can taste the difference when restaurants use fresh ingredients and love what they do. Yum!"}
{"text":"We order her a few times a year, good pizza! The best thing about them is their delivery time. Always fast and always early."}
{"text":"We haven't ordered for a while because of the horrible customer service we had multiple times. Tonight we decided to give it another try because the food is good. Yet AGAIN our order was wrong and I called them about it. The (who I assume) owner never apologized, interrupted me and said he would send another calzone.... Too bad his attitude makes me not trust what new food they send me. He never apologized once, not once! They just don't care about their customers. When you don't care enough about your customers to ever apologize when something is wrong, then what kind of things are you doing to your food? What kind of care are you putting into your restaurant and food storage. This was the last chance we gave them. We are done for sure now, never again! What a rude arrogant person this guy is!"}
{"text":"Decent pizza but very annoyed with the business and customer service of this place. Just drove 30 min to get our food only to be called 20 minutes after we already picked it up and the workers had the audacity to ask us to bring back our food because they gave us an extra order  um??? This is your mistake why am I being made to waste my gas and time to bring it back when they could easily make another. Bad business practices, just rude, DEFINITELY won't come back and DO NOT recommends"}
{"text":"While not the best in the area... certainly not the worst. I've only had their traditional pizza but it's always ready fast and the staff is pleasant.  They have a pickup special on Mondays and Tuesdays for less than 7 dollars for a large. We have made it a weekly stop but would probably drive past this place if I wanted higher quality food."}
{"text":"Composite review:  I have been to this Pizza place several times.  Convenient to my location in the Wexford area off Brandt School Road.  I've found that smaller shops that are more dedicated to pizza tend to have more consistency in their product.  This shop is small; it is not a do-all establishment.  Pizza is main stream without any of the oddities that often appear in other menu's.  Small front parking lot; traffic is fast so careful on entering and exiting.  Staff has been gracious even when hurried under customer load.  There are a dozen other places within easy driving and delivery distance of this pizza place; and it remains in business, healthily.   Doing something right!  f8 and be there."}
{"text":"This place has the potential to be good but they just don't care!! We ordered the ranch steak pizza and it was incredibly dry and had  only a few tiny chipped pieces of steak on it so it was like eating dry French fries! The Caesar salad was definately not worth $8.99..  for 30$ plus tip, we will go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Good pizza. The sauce is sweeter than most pizza sauces I've had. The service is a little slow sometimes, but I think that's partly because of understaffing. The Italian subs are good, too. Overall, I'd recommend this place"}
{"text":"This is THEE best pizza in the burgh!  Fiori's pizza has NOTHING on this place!  To have the best pizza you have to have the right ratio of tasty cheese to sauce as well as a nice doughy crust.  There are so many varities of pizza that it would take months to try them all.  My favorite is the cheeseburger pizza, with a special sauce that's surprising once you guess it.  You really can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"We ordered two specialties - Pterodactyl and Charlie and a regular pizza.  The Charlie - sauced with buffalo, was bland. The Pterodactyl was delicious!  Both had excellent crust!  The regular pizza was very good.  Nice sauce, lots of cheese, and excellent crust.  I look forward to trying more of the crazy menu items!"}
