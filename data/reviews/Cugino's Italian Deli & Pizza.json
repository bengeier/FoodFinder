{"text":"I am here right now and I am signing up on Yelp for this. It is a cheap looking place, with no outstanding food yet soo overpriced. 4 stars?? You need to get out more! 2 stars for the shady way in pricing products and non existent service."}
{"text":"One of the VERY FEW places in Vegas where you're gonna find a piece of back east. Cugino's is phenominal. The food is authentic and tastes like you're sittin' back in Jersey or NYC. The service is like you're among family and the prices you cannot beat. You will fall in love with this place! I ordered a plain cheese pizza and some other heavenly things. After being overly disappointed time and time again with so many other pizza places out here I almost gave up and...FINALLY!!!! CUGINO'S!!! I  found my pizza place. no more searching out here. Walk inside the place and you'll find classic brands of pastas and sauces from when you were a kid. And *drum roll* they make THEE BEST tiramisu in town! I ain't kiddin! There are so many good things to say about this place. Gaahd, I love this place!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good and I do think I will come back. It doesn't deserve 5 stars because I feel like if a restaurant is going to get a 5 star rating then it should blow me away. This place is more of a good enough to go back, but not somewhere I'm going to go crazy about. I ordered the parmesan chicken and it was pretty good but it was kinda small. It was a bit pricy for the portion ($10) but I'll pay a little extra if that means I get a good meal. I'd only recommend this place if you're in the area, but not a place where I would go out of my way to get to."}
{"text":"Absolutely love it, authentic italian food, wish there was more of this kind in germany! As being a half italian myself i can tell you that the food is homemade and made with passion."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for years but Al Gore hadn't invented the Internet yet so I couldn't of even posted if I wanted to! It is funny to come into a place like this and watch men eat salads like the table next to me, I come here for the sandwiches  artery clogging meats and cholesterol increasing cheesecake. Keep your salads away from me you health nut!!! Got the Meatball Parmigiana, nothing healthy about it just pure unadulterated goodness. I managed to get here before the lunch rush which I'm glad I did because then your waiting for a table to open up."}
{"text":"I am going to start off with the good here. This place is family run and they really make you feel welcome. Mama is running around, sons are doing son things and it is very friendly. That being said, the food was abysmal. This was my first time there. I had the linguine and white clam sauce and my friend had the lasagna. The linguine was horrible. It had a smell reminiscent of a fish dock in the summer. The lasagna was a warmed over lump of congealed cheese and pasta with sauce. We ended up taking both items in a to go box and then disposing of them.  I am hoping that we hit there on a bad day. My friend wants me to try again.... I am not there... yet."}
{"text":"Fantastic traditional Italian style deli including a little of the attitude :). When we arrived the bread knots were just coming out of the over. 3 for $1 and unbelievable!! I wanted to try one of their sandwiches so I limited myself to 6. Sandwich was also fantastic.  Doesn't get better."}
{"text":"the best spot Italian Deli and Pizza in Las Vegas! hands down I been everywhere, even better than back home, love the chicken parm and the broccoli rob. Awesome!"}
{"text":"Italian food doesn't get any better than this.   No matter what I have ordered, it has always been the best.  I have recommended this place to many of my friends. This is not from Harvey lol  It's from Eileen in Las vegas"}
{"text":"As a former (reformed ) New Yorker myself, walking into Cugino's deli fills me with nostalgia for the way things use to be in NY delis in almost any neighborhood. I've been coming here for about four years, dine in and take out and I'm happy every time. Family owned and operated, the boys tend to run the front counter and are some of the nicest guys in the city. They recognize me by name and make me feel like part of the famiglia, cugino means cousin after all.   The food is unabashedly old school \"red sauce New York\" Italian, the kind of comfort food that grandmas pass down from generation to generation of Italian American families. Oft imitated, but rarely perfected, Cugino's delivers a hearty, soul warming meal that scratches that itch for a solid plate of parmigiana drenched in top quality mozzarella and a tangy home style red sauce. Then pizza is authentic too, owing to their Staten Island roots. It's not fancy, it's just what you need when you want a slice of NY pizza to make you long for the old days when your corner pizza joint was the place to go for a snack after work or school.   Their hot sandwiches are tops, try the Sausage and broccoli rabe with provolone, it's one of the best things on a roll in the whole city. They've started offering a Philly favorite too, the roast pork sandwich, which is a classic as well. You can't go wrong with their standard entrees either, the eggplant rollatini is basically cheese heaven with their homemade, creamy ricotta seasoned just right. Sausages made in house by the patriarch of the family, who is a butcher by trade, are top notch.   This is unpretentious, home style cooking, in a charming counter service deli with a few pizzeria style seating areas. Loads of cold cuts and Italian specialties line the walls for purchase, if you need a ton of food to satisfy the masses, they'll cater any event, nothing's too big or too small, they'll accommodate you!    Support these local business and keep Vegas a locals paradise. Thanks guys, for the years of yummy food and making me feel at home every time I come in!!!  Grazie mille!!"}
{"text":"This spot is amazing! The staff is extremely knowledgable, friendly and kick butt at what they do! We ordered the Italiano #1, #2 and the Cugino's Special is to die for. EVERYTHING is made in house and fresh. The mozzarella is spectacular and Donnie gave us a hearty sample. The bread is crispy on the outside and melts in your mouth with the first bite. They have tons of great imports, meats, cheeses, olives, desserts and lavAzza coffee!  Thank you Cugino's! I'll be returning for more."}
{"text":"Off the hook....As new York as new York gets... These guys owned lennys pizzeria (Saturday night fever ) and a famous meat market called A and S in brooklyn..I was in the pizza business and I know good pizza and cuginos pizza is the best not only in Vegas but west of the Mississippi!!!!!  Hands down.. Try there Sicilian pizza nobody  makes it in Vegas like Cuginos!!!! I think they make the best pizza in Vegas bar none!!!! They make there sausage in house and there rice balls are to die for...everything is fresh and there restaurant is immaculate you could eat off the floor......."}
{"text":"This is our first time of following Yelp reviews and being disappointed. The food was ok, just ok. We ordered a cheese pizza, fresh tomato & basil (that came with approximately 8 small pieces of basil, but lots of garlic the garlic, the only nice surprise), cannoli (flavor was good, but it was unusually crunchy and we couldn't get over the texture) and a tiramisu which we haven't tried yet - we couldn't because we are in a hotel room (which they knew, they delivered it to us) and were not given any plates, napkins, a fork to eat the tiramisu with... Nothing.  Even with that, the BIGGER disappointment was how long it took. It was estimated at 45-60 minutes delivery through Eat24 and it took 90 minutes!!!!  At 80 minutes I used the check order status stating we still had no food and their reply was \"We know you're hungry (we're hungry too!)\".   What?!?!?  Really?!?!? Ok, but YOU didn't order the food 80 minutes ago!!!  It's NOT about YOU, it's about an unhappy customer who gave you an opportunity to explain the delay and when we could expect our food to arrive. We received ABSOLUTELY NO CUSTOMER SERVICE!  Not likely to order through this again. Not happy.  I wouldn't order delivery if you're actually hungry."}
{"text":"Food here was really really good, ordered from them on eat24 , they were ontime and it was truly delicious! Prices are great too"}
{"text":"This place stole my heart!! I LOVE Italian food, I LOVE Italians cooking authentic Italian food.. lol. The chefs mother makes the homemade tiramisu.. must try :)   We heard about this place from my husbands client a few months ago.. since then we've been numerous times. When you walk in and look to the left you will see the wall lined with all the ingredients that they use in their kitchen.. which they also have for sale.. They have a little deli area where they also sell the meats & cheeses they use.  EVERYTHING IS FRESH.. their pizza dough, ingredients, etc. They also offer gluten free crust..  ok so not sure how many of you know how to test the crust of your pizza crust.. lol but you pick it up & hold it up.. if your piece of pizza stays extended out & can stay held up then the crust is perfect.. if your piece of pizza falls over & all your toppings fall off... thats bad pizza crust.. lol. So obviously my pepp pizza passed the test.. lol.   Their salads are amzing.. the knots are flavorful & perfect size. The sandwiches are HUGE and so good.. when you call to order to go ask about their sandwiches on special.. they come up with some pretty good combinations. the meat & cheeses are quality!"}
{"text":"Food was great. Everything fresh. The garlic knots burst with flavor when you bite into them. Very happy we went"}
{"text":"Cugino's catered a wedding for my husband and I this past March! Our guests are STILL inquiring where all the delicious food came from!   The food was very authentic and there is such a good variety of Italian dishes to choose from so there's literally something for everyone.   The best thing about this place is the service from the owners and the family! They are so welcoming and knowledgable about their business heritage, their menu and offerings, and very accommodating to what you are asking for. Planning a wedding is hard enough, especially when trying to place a $2000 food order for guests. Cugino's staff was very patient and available for all of our needs, and even delivered everything to the venue with supplies to keep the food warm.   I love this place! Truly a gem here in Las Vegas! I only wish they had a location that was closer to my house!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved it! The produce on their vegetarian pizza was so delicious, the crust was nice and crispy. The cannolis were the best my mom had ever had. Gotta get all that, a pack Dr. Brown soda and a box of pizzelles when I come through vegas again!"}
{"text":"All that can be said is Amazing. Staten Island ol school Italian cooking. You may even get a peak at mom helping out on the back"}
{"text":"Convenient, next to UNLV.  Great Calzones and Pizza.  Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"By FAR the best pizza I've had so far in Vegas. Most places will blame the water, humidity, altitude, the position of the moon for their pizza not being as good as back east. Obviously not true, this place has great pizza"}
{"text":"The moment I walked into Cugino's I felt like I was back in New York and one step closer to finding the tastiest NY pizza in Las Vegas. The friendly staff had my pizza ready and waiting exactly on time (along with an order of garlic knots and canoli...because you can't forget the canoli).  I was also pleased to see they had a huge assortment of Italian specialties, especially fresh mozzarella, available.   Five stars for great crust, flavorful sauce, plenty of cheese and excellent service. And the canoli was beyond awesome. Rock on, Cugino's! As Arnold said, \"I'll be back.\""}
{"text":"Feels like family feeding you.  Everything is fresh.  The pizza is wonderful and the sandwhiches are amazing. Go!!"}
{"text":"Great quality and pizza by the slice available! Sandwiches look amazing also. Got the lunch special. 2 slices and a drink for $5.99."}
{"text":"Been going to Cugino's since 2004 and after all this time it is still my favorite Italian place in Vegas. A lot of people come here for their pizzas and pastas, which are all good. But what really puts this place over the top for me is their sandwiches. Any of their parmigianas are excellent. Do yourself a favor and get Donnie's Special sometime. In fact, almost anything they put in between bread is worth trying.   My top 5 sandwiches: 1. Donnie's Special 2. Philly Cheese Steak 3. Sausage, Peppers, and Eggs 4. Cugino's Special 5. Meatball Parmigiana  They also have a section next to the checkout counter where they sell quality stuff such as roast peppers, marinated mushrooms, marinated eggplant, grilled vegetables, sausage, and stromboli. They're all blackout good. Don't forget to try their garlic knots, seasoned fries, and Sicilian rice balls, all of which are also made in-house. They also have incredibly tasty sweets like cannolis and cheesecake, both of which rank among the best I've ever tried.   You'll need countless trips to this place just to try everything they have to offer, and chances are you won't anytime soon because you'll probably end up buying some of the same things over and over again. Vegas is very lucky to have a great deli such as this and I hope they'll stick around for many years to come."}
{"text":"I wish Seattle had more Italian delis like this . The Italian sub, i forgot if I got the #1 or #2 , was soooo good. One of the best cold subs I've ever had. I had to take it togo on my 3 hr flight back home and when I got home it was still In perfect shape and  delish!!! I also ordered these risotto rice balls stuffed with meat which was pretty good too. I will def come back. Next time I'll order a lot more Subs to go.."}
{"text":"The worst place in las Vegas the owners are rude the food is terrible! The actual location is DIRTY!!!! Avoid this place"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Ordered takeout and they worked with me to get the food delivered to an address that Yelp didn't recognize as a place they could deliver to at the airport. Pizza was excellent, got the Melanzana and Margarita. Chicken parm and Eggplant parm were both exceptional. Fettuccine alfredo and Greek salads were also excellent. Born and raised in Jersey, good pizza and  Italian food is hard to find. This place meets the mark and I will be sure to get food from here next time I'm in Vegas, especially to enjoy for our flight home. Thanks to the guy from NY who worked with me on the phone."}
{"text":"Every time I come in Donny and his sons are always so attentive.  Pizza by the slice, zucchini fries and spumoni.... yum! Best part is it is across from UNLV so I can come on break and have some lunch! I love tge atmosphere of the deli too. My boyfriend said he felt like he was back in his hometown deli. (Boston)"}
{"text":"Tough choice between the meatball parm and chicken parm. I went chicken parm sub and was very happy."}
{"text":"Awesome sicilian pizza. Best I have had since I left NY in 2002. Others have come close but this is the best."}
{"text":"I love Cugino's. I lived in Las Vegas for 2 years and I have to say that Cugino's was the best part about the whole city. I want to thank the Cugino's family for blessing me with their existence. If it weren't for them, I would have lived a fruitless life in Las Vegas. I found the courage to get out of bed every morning only because I knew that at some point in the day, I would be graced with the privilege of eating one of Cugino's sandwiches. The people that work at Cugino's are true humanitarians. If you go, get the Italian #2. Or if you are feeling frisky, ask Donny for his special sub, you wont regret it, and neither will he. Thats all I have to say."}
{"text":"EVERYTHING at Cuginos is good.  From the pizza (they ship in the water from NY to make the dough), to the sausage (try the chicken and provolone), to all of the sandwiches (the best, juiciest pastrami I've had in Vegas).  Everything is good.  Probably because they make everything themselves in house and cooking great Italian food runs in their family.  I am so happy that I discovered this place.  It has that cozy neighborhood NY style deli feel that is hard to find in Vegas.  Besides all of the Italian lunch and dinner items, they also have some of the best quality cured meats, cheeses, and other deli items that you would expect from a true Italian deli.  I live down the street from this place and I go there several times a week.  I have been lucky enough to get to know the family that owns the place.  They are all very nice and are so good at what they do.  When you eat at Cuginos you can tell that they know what they are doing.  And if you go in and you're not sure what to order, I have two words for you: Donnie Special.  It is chicken cutlets with roasted peppers, fresh home made mozzarella, and oil and vinegar served on a toasted roll.  I like to get it with a little extra oil and vinegar on the side for dipping.  It is one of the best creations I have ever had in my life."}
{"text":"Wow, after a week of over paying for food at several strip restaurants, and being underwhelmed ( read my Spago review ), a fantastic surprise. Our flight doesn't leave until 11:15 pm so we checked out of Planet Hollywood. We booked a room at a great very boutique feeling Fairfield inn on Paradise Rd instead of being miserable hanging around the airport and decided to order take-out. The lady at the desk recommended Cuginos. We ordered online and it came direct to our room. It was hot and absolutely delicious. We ordered for two and they delivered enough food for at least four hungry people. It also tasted like authentic Italian. I highly recommend this place. Great value and great food."}
{"text":"Really good, had the lobster ravioli and meat ball sub, super tastey. Also tried some olives, which were slightly salty in my opinion but still good. Also had a slice of cheese cake--that was delish, no toppings necessary. Its a little expensive, but great and friendly service, and good food make it worth it. But yes good food does take a little time fyi..."}
{"text":"The food is good, but the delivery is terrible.  At 3:30pm on a Saturday they quoted me 50 minutes through eat24.  Since I am an 8 minute drive up a single street away from Cugino's that seemed like a long wait to me already.  I ended up getting my food after 1 hour and 15 minutes.  The driver then lied to me saying \"NASCAR is in town, traffic is crazy\".  I had just been out and there was no traffic, I looked on google maps and confirmed that there was no traffic.  Just own up to the fact that you messed up."}
{"text":"I don't often give 5 stars out but the food here deserves every one of them! We ordered the Cugino specialty pizza; the crust was crispy and cooked perfectly. The sauce is spectacular, and finally the cheese, oh the cheese, it was fresh and flavorful. I savored each bite and limited myself-two slices, I didn't want a belly ache but it was so hard I yearned for another slice. We also ordered the fried ravioli and cannoli, once again the cheese, oh the cheese was so flavorful. The cannoli was creamy and devilishly good. Great find for my neighborhood gym cause I'll need a double membership in order to work off all the calories that I will be consuming now that I have found the most AMAZING pizza."}
{"text":"This place is a must-try if you are in Las Vegas and have a car. I am sure anything you get here will be good, the decorations could use a little face-lift, but as far as food goes you will be happy here."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan when pizza restaurants reheat their pizza or when the slices are greasy, but I overlook those shortcomings because it's tasty, affordable, and close to my casa.  #HashtagsDontWorkOnYelp"}
{"text":"Wow!!  I am Italian and living in Vegas it is hard to find good Italian subs. I am so glad I found this place! I love their cutlet sandwich with vinegar & oil. I also love their deli counter, and mini market with imported food from Italy. The whole staff seems like they are straight from New York, with their accent and all. It is a favorite in my book!! Just wish they had Italian Desserts. I didn't see any on the menu or behind the counter."}
{"text":"Affordable Italian food, not for real Italian food experts though. I had their eggplant rollatini (which in Italian doesn't mean anything, the real word would be INVOLTINI) with pasta and salad. Their food is ok but portions are too overwhelming and loaded with unnecessary calories...too much ricotta, too much pasta...just too much.  I guess that's the reason why it's always packed with students (their dorms are just on the other side of th road).  Their pizza didn't look that great so I haven't tried it and I also tried their rice fried balls...it tasted too much like milk...far away from the real Italian ARANCINI.  It's an OK place but I will not go back."}
{"text":"Got the sicilian with a #2 hoagie.  Good pizza still great hoagie not so friendly service.  Lady at the counter looked like I was from  mars........no hello.....just stared at me until I ordered.    I guess Yelp entitlement has finally set in."}
{"text":"Went 2 nights in a row.  Great pizza and a nice classic Caesar salad.  Bathroom was spotless and dining area nice and clean too."}
{"text":"This is my first review because I really loved this restaurant.  The food was exceptional! Going back soon!"}
{"text":"First of all, I would like to start by saying I honestly do not know what any of these bad reviewers are talking about. From the second my husband and I walked in, we were greeted with a smile and amazing service(HE is from Minnesota, and was the one who ordered, so their politeness had nothing to do with the fact that the owners & myself are both from NY). I do not ever give 5 star reviews, but this place deserves it. Having just moved to Vegas from NYC, I expected to have to have my father Fed-Ex us pizza from our local pizza spot if I ever wanted to to eat good pizza again. Well, THANK GOD for Cugino's for making that unnecessary! I am Italian and normally make my own amazing-if-I-do-say-so-myself sauce. When I took a bite of their Sicilian pizza and their sauce tasted EXACTLY like mine(and my mother's, and my grandmother's), I knew I had found a piece of home here in Vegas. The crust had the perfect amount of thickness, and just enough cheese, but not too much, which is just the way I like it. My husband ordered a chicken cutlet hero with lettuce, tomato, and mayo; it was absolutely AMAZING. The sandwich had more than enough chicken to cover the bread, the cutlets were perfectly breaded, and the Italian bread it was on was just right for the perfect sandwich. The owner came over while we were eating to make sure everything was right with our food, and to ask us how we liked the place. This is definitely the best pizza & deli you are going to find in Vegas. P.S. I'd like to send a nice kick in the butt to all the people with negative comments about this place; you obviously do not know what good pizza tastes like, nor are accustomed to quality, home-made food. =)"}
{"text":"NYC 's Little Italy in Las Vegas! Feels like home. All that's missing is the pinball machine in the corner!"}
{"text":"I found out about this place via Yelp and I couldn't be happier. It's easy to find, just across the street from UNLV. I got the meatball parm sandwich special (comes with small drink) for $6.99 and my boyfriend got the spaghetti and meatball special (small drink again) for $8.99. As per the previous reviews on Yelp, we also got some garlic knots.  The garlic knots were fantastic- warm, crispy yet chewy, and covered in garlic butter with chunks of fresh garlic and parsley. The meatball sub had a bright tangy marinara sauce, fresh slabs of mozzarella and a soft yet crusty bread. The meatballs were amazing- very well seasoned with a fine texture. The same sauce and meatballs were in the spaghetti special. The pasta was perfectly al dente. This was our first meal after 4 hours of traveling on the road and it hit the spot completely."}
{"text":"I love pizza, and this is great FRESH pizza. If you like NY style, this is it. Nice sauce and cheese portion along with a great crunch like NY style should be. Will be going back very soon!"}
{"text":"I love the cheese pizza, tastes just like the ones in New York. I have to add that the pizza is better than the other Popular Pizza place in town. I had to eat here 3x to confirm that decision! I also had the baked ziti which had a very good flavor to the dish. Can't wait to try their other items on the menu. The place is ran by the family who owns it and they are all extremely nice. It seems that the usual customers are known by name here. My second time back the owner remembered me. That says a lot!"}
{"text":"Found this place through Yelp, read the reviews, decided to try it.  Good move!  Went there on 2011-04-18.  Walked in to what felt like an east coast Italian deli with a few small tables in the middle and a walk-up deli counter to order.  Nothing fancy...  Saw Veal Parm sandwich on the menu - just had to try it!  I haven't had a decent \"veal on a bun\" since living in Little Italy in Toronto... one bite and I was back 25 years to those days!  Beautiful crusty but soft bun, veal sauced just right, cheese, peppers... all freshly made!    I'll be back again before leaving Vegas... now I only have to find a way to relocate them to Phoenix...  Update:  Went back again on 2011-04-21.  Tried a few other items which changed my rating slightly from 5 stars to 4 stars.  I still like this place and need to try more items before settling on a final rating.   This trip, I tried the garlic knots; very garlic-y, but needs either a little salt or a marinara dip to complete it.  Also tried the Jamaican beef patty after reading about it on other reviews here, but was somewhat disappointed.  They're more dough-y than flaky, and the beef filling is a tinge bitter - not sure why.  I love beef patties, so I'm very picky - and what do you expect ordering a Jamaican item from an Italian deli?  (If anyone is in Toronto, Randy's beef patties is much better!)  Ordered the liverwurst sandwich for my other half; it was as good as could be expected for a loaded liverwurst sandwich.  Their home-made bread really makes the difference on their sandwiches!   To be fair, I ordered items outside of their mainline menu this trip, so that affected their rating.  I suspect if we stay with their mainline italian menu items, my ratings will go up again - but that's for another visit.  I'll definitely come back for another try!"}
{"text":"A very charming place right across UNLV! I highly recommend trying their chicken wings (delicious!) or spaghetti with marinara sauce (in my opinion, a little better than their spaghetti with fresh tomato sauce as the dish has more balanced portion of sauce). The spaghetti come with an extra salad and are served with warmed bread.  - I would suggest that you: eat in rather than do a take out -- the take-out was not nearly as good; order chicken wings plain with a sauce on the side"}
{"text":"I recently moved from the east coast to Las Vegas and was very happy to discover Cuginos.  It's a REAL east coast deli. Food is great and the family that runs it is very nice."}
{"text":"This place is delish. The pepperoni pizza is the closest you can get to NY style pizza, make sure you fold it! The garlic knots are so yummy and so are the neopolitan rice balls. Another yummy is the reuban and make sure you try their italian ice. I've gotten delivery from here a few times with my girlfriend and I find this place really addicting."}
{"text":"went to Cugino's looking to relive some great memories of fantastic east coast italian food.  well  - as las vegas goes the food at Cugino's is superb and it's probably as close as i have ever come to getting the same food anywhere on the west coast.  although the deli looked quite good it was the pizza, meatball sandwich and soup that got me.  not much else to say except the place is great."}
{"text":"I eat pizza maybe 3-4x a yr or so, but Cugino seems like it'll change that!!! In Vegas for a while and I went yesterday and ordered the the small white clam pizza to go and it was soooooo good! Just finished the last slice now for lunch and I want more! Heading back this evening to order  the large!  I also tried the garlic knots and it was really nice, and filling, cant beat $2.99 for 6 of them. Friendly atmosphere, and I was even offered a garlic knot while I waited, great service!  I have had pizza from the reg pizza spots and I have had Cugino's! Clear difference!"}
{"text":"I read so many good reviews, that I have to think this was an off day. - My two slices of cheese pizza looked nothing like the pictures on the web, and was barely average tasting. - My Philly Cheese Steak was skimpy and the peppers and onions were not sauteed like I asked - Garlic knots - they were forgetful - Veal parm sub - it was forgetful  There were so many good reviews that I will definitely try this place again, but what a disappointment for the first time visit. The best thing about this place was all the Italians, it felt like home."}
{"text":"Went here a few times for a quick lunch after my classes at UNLV and WOW great food here. A bit pricey but you get huge portions of whatever you order. Staff is pretty friendly too. Great family run business! Will go back without a doubt!"}
{"text":"I don't know about the rest of the menu, but spaghetti and meatballs, mediocre at best. Might as well go to  a chain restaurant . Should do better if your claiming east-coast. The bread was no better.  Doesn't anyone know how to cook?"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem!.. Great family owned place, food was fresh and everything is made from scratch!!! Can't find a place like this in the bay area. Trust me we've looked. I would come to Vegas just to have lunch here again!!! We had a calzone, pizza, pasta and meat ball sandwich, everything was delicious!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is wonderful.  The staff is very attentive and friendly.  The food is amazingly good. I wouldn't go anywhere else."}
{"text":"I came for some slices of pizza , but they were all out, and said it would be a 30 minute wait for slices.  I asked how long for a meatball sub.  Cool older guy who took my order pointed to the guy in the kitchen area and said not long he's not doing anything.  The meatball sandwich was excellent.  Very friendly and funny service."}
{"text":"Omg goodness this place is amazing I got the caprese salad and garden salad absolute fresh perfection! The garlic knots are the size they SHOULD BE and loaded with garlicy goodness!  The tomato and basil pizza is a must have! Thank u for delivering to me I'm far away, and I appreciate your food! Remember to tip yall"}
{"text":"I ordered the Italian #1 sandwich.  It was good and loaded with meat.  I will have to go back and try their pizza or pasta."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!   Finally!  Where has this place been hiding?  I am from NY and have yet to find a decent Italian Deli in this town.  Best eggplant parm I have had in 8 years.  The Marina was just right and the Italian bread was just right.   As it turns out the owners are from my hometown in NY.  I will surely be headed back with my family to enjoy this hidden gem.   Highly recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"A MUST first stop for a great hero, slice and to-die-for garlic knots. Quality, quantity taste as well as presentation are Top Notch. Open 7 days a week. Stop in. You will be glad you did."}
{"text":"The best place in Vegas. Josh hooks it up as soon as you enter. Food is amazing and service is incredibly just as good. No gmos or preservatives; just great, bomb food with good vibes"}
{"text":"This is a family owned and run business. The look is typical of an Italian Deli/Cafe. The atmosphere is warm as are the Owners/Freddie, Julianna, Donnie and Michael. My wife and I own a local bakery and were told about Cuginos by one of our customers. We have been devoted fans ever since!! The lasagna is the best we've ever had ANYWHERE, and the sandwiches are awesome. Only the finest ingredients are used as is reflected in the mozzerella and ricotta made in-house. Definitely a great find!"}
{"text":"I've studied at the university for years and just now discovered this place. The staff is approachable. There's a deli for meats and cheeses. The food was delicious. I only had a meatball parm sandwich but I plan on coming back to this place to eat some more things on the menu."}
{"text":"Such a great lil lunch spot.  What it lacks in atmosphere it more than makes up for with the food and value.  I'm not a huge meatball person but i LOVE their meatball parm lunch special.  For $8, you get a HUGE meatball parm sub sandwich and a drink.  I always eat half the sandwich for lunch and save the other half for a later meal.  Delicioso."}
{"text":"Tony Soprano is in the back, salivating over the possibility that Don will let him have at the antipasto...  First of all, if you haven't been to Cugino's, you might've wasted most of your life until now...at least lunch hour.  This is the real thing, and in Las Vegas, that's saying something.  In Brooklyn, Cugino's would be found in the side of some brick building lacquered with 100 years of patina and the best sauce that Nona can make.  In Las Vegas, the closest thing to brick is 30-year old stucco, but inside, the feel is right and the smell is amazing.  Having eaten everything on the menu (literally, everything, from the Frutta di Mare to the Tuna Salad to the Don's Special), I have some favorites.  If you were to ask me about the last thing I'd eat on earth, it would be the Eggplant Rollatini and Penne ala Vodka.  These two dishes are my usuals for the past few years.  Why? Simplicity.  The Eggplant is sliced thin and breaded, fried and rolled around creamy, luscious ricotta and marinara filling, and then baked in marinara and mozzarella.  It is fork-tender, which is not the case with most eggplant, and about the only thing I've never gotten bored of eating.  Follow that up with a plate of Penne ala Vodka - the best Vodka sauce I've ever had...so good, in fact, I stopped making my own!  Other great things on, and off, of the menu include the Reuben on marble rye, the Don's Special, either Americano sandwich, and the Antipasto salad.  The sandwiches come with a drink, and the entrees come with a fresh salad and bread.  Another note, everything here is made in house, from the cheese to the salads to the sauces and desserts - one exception is the pasta, which is brought in from a maker in Brooklyn who, it was explained to me, makes it as good as can be made.  One final note, Cugino's is a deli and, as such, has meats and cheeses for sale, along with a large variety of imported Italian brand products, like tomatoes, cookies, oil, Arborio rice and Lavazza coffee.  I could go on, but that would mean writing a dissertation; it's better if you just go grab a cappuccino and a plate of macaroni (Also, why not support a great, local, family-owned business)...  Buon Appetito!"}
{"text":"It's very difficult to find good Italian deli in Vegas. I got tired of buying Parmasan cheese from American stores and found this place on line. While there I got real Parm Reggiano, mortadella, Genoa salami, and bread. I also got an Italian hero #2, at first I was disappointed in the size, about 8\", and I thought this wouldn't be enough. I was wrong! This hero was loaded with meat, cheese, lettuce tomato and the perfect amount of oil vinegar and oregano. Although somewhat of a drive I WILL RETURN!!"}
{"text":"Wow, I walked in the door and soon realized I was no longer in Las Vegas. The staff was friendly and attentive. They brought our meal to our table after it was prepared. We had a green salad, a Chicken Parm sandwich and a couple orders of Garlic knots.  It felt like all the customers that streamed in (including a large family) were regulars - and I got the impression all the adults were from New York, and many were tattoo clad.  The cold sandwiches are large. The hot sandwiches were smaller than I thought they would be - but delicious none the less.  There was no music playing, which was a relief. I really hate music in restaurants. They had a couple TVs quietly playing a current sporting event.  Tons of stuff to catch your eye and genuine Deli atmosphere really made this an enjoyable lunch. I would go again in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"I cant say no to anything here! Pizza, pasta, subs, wings, you name it! haven't said no to one menu item here! the family is very nice as well! they treat you like family as well down there! Best italian deli/pizzeria in town!"}
{"text":"The best chicken parm I've ever had!  The entree comes with a large portion of breaded fresh chicken breast(2 or 3 large pieces), pasta marinara, a salad, and two breadsticks!  More than enough for two people to split.  Very friendly family run business."}
{"text":"Get teleported to NY. This is a family run joint and it exceeds all expectations. Absolutely THE best Italian deli on the west coast easily. The pizza tastes just like back in NYC, the sandwiches are phenomenal, customer service is friendly and fast."}
{"text":"This time around I ate one of their sandwiches, the \"Cugino's Special\" with a side of macaroni salad.  Delicious!!!  My only reason for giving 4 stars versus 5 stars: my lunch, the sandwich and side cost $11.35 after taxes. No drink, just the sandwich and side."}
{"text":"Positive - Great cannolis! Delicious chicken park sandwich!  Negative - Out of the way. On campus. Small seating area."}
{"text":"Fantastic.  My best find of Italian food in Vegas.  If you work at or attend unlv, this place is a must."}
{"text":"Holy CRAP!!! The # 2 sandwich . I'm in love!!! So taste. Mouth-Gazim !!! Fast friend family style service. THANK YOU GUYS!!! I will be back.  So ppl if your visiting or live in Vegas. You must stop by & chow down."}
{"text":"Freshly made mozzarella cheese I've got today was so awesome! I just came to get pasta (bucatini is my fav), capers and tomato sauce (NINA is so tasty and thick), but ended up getting mozzarella, pinwheels (best that I've ever tasted), and 1LB of salami. The guy always offer me to taste something yummy which I always end up buying, and he usually gives me a good discount. Love this place!!! I live near summerlin but it's worth the drive :)"}
{"text":"Best italian food I ever had! We stayed in Vegas for 4 days. Went to the Rio and Bellagio buffets and they are nothing compared to Cuginos!   We had the: Sicilian tripe soup- OMG!!! I'm craving as I type!  Garlic knots- yummy! My 5 yr old devoured it right away  Cheese pizza- best I've ever had!  Reuben melt- amazing! Lots of meat!   #1 italian sandwich- yummy!  Rice balls (meat and cheese)- yummy!! And the marinara sauce- OMG! Owner said they cool the sauce for 4 hrs.  Jamaican patty- it was good but overshadowed by the rest of the meal.  Frutti di mare- a-mazing! Lots of seafood! Yummy sauce!  What the place lacks in ambiance and presentation, the make up for the taste and quality of their food. And in the end, that's all that matters!"}
{"text":"Nice little place near my university. I've always had a good experience here and I must commend them for making a wonderful cup of Lavazza cappuccino. They also sell it by the can too."}
{"text":"My family and I were visiting from Texas and stopped here after reading the reviews.  I am so glad we did!  We were very impressed with the food and service.  It was one of our favorite places.  We live in Dallas and get tired of chain restaurants with no heart.  We loved this place, family owned with a lot of pride.  It was obvious in the food."}
{"text":"The owners are racist and sexist. I had to endure horrible pro Trump, sexist talk and when I asked the owners to stop they basically said no and they didn't care about my business. I'd been eating here for a year. Don't eat here unless you want to support misogyny"}
{"text":"We had a slice of pizza, chicken wings and a sausage, peppers and eggs sandwich all great. This is going to be one our main stops when Ro and I Are out and about."}
{"text":"OMG. I'm used to having great Italian food and  this is truly delicious. The lasagna was so tasty. The Sicilian combo pizza was spectacular. My daughter said she gives it a 10 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"I'm from the east coast so coming to this place was very nostalgic for me. I like coming here for the pizza and sandwiches. I also love that they carry ITALIAN ICE. I grew up around that stuff so when I found it here I was super excited. I brought some of my east coast friends with me for lunch one day and they all agreed that they felt like they were back home :)"}
{"text":"Went in because my girlfriend was next door getting her nails done next door and wanted to snack on something so happy I  did.  Definitely one of the top 5 Pizza places I've been to on the west with a lot of East coast flavor . A pizzeria is always defined by the basic pies Margherita and  pepperoni they definitely hit the nail on the head with these I was blown away. Definitely reminded me of living on the east coast and NY. So glad I walked in . Also lady behind was great chat . Service was quick and prompt ."}
{"text":"I don't know if this place is good or not I ordered delivery and after an hour and a half of waiting I called and they said it would come at any time at that point and then 2 hours later I called and the place was closed"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal when it comes to New York Italian. The spaghetti and meatballs are out of this world, and my wife, who is a lasagne connoisseur cannot get enough of this amazing old Sicilian recipe. An the wings....order them hot with extra buffalo sauce, and you'll be floored. Did I mention the garlic knots??? Okay, enough out of me....time for lunch for the third straight day at Cugino's."}
{"text":"Being an ex-New Yorker there are very few Italian Deli's here in the west which are a GREAT authentic New York Italian Deli. Let me tell you Cugino's is a diamond here in the Las Vegas desert. If your looking for a good Italian pastries/pies, Italian ice, Bronx Special Sandwich (fried eggplant,, red peppers, mozz, and sauce), or Pizza this is the place you gotta come too! ----Oh the homemade cannoli's yum!!  They even have a great grocery store with a ton of Italian cuisines (pastas, meats) you can only find at Cuginos.  The family that runs the place is very friendly and accommodating, so if you want something you had in New York they can most likey make it.  These people are straight from Italy via New York so you know you're gonna get some real great food. I highly recommend that if you come to Vegas or you're a local you should defiantly eat or shop at Cugino's over and over again.  I just wish it was closer to Sacramento!"}
{"text":"Great service...very close to the strip..from scratch ranch dressing!...glad.we came here...very delicious pizza. .."}
{"text":"Small hole in wall deli. Great meatball sandwich!  Family owned and it shows. Definitely will come again on next visit to Vegas."}
{"text":"Best damn Italian food ever!! It's a deli style cuisine with fancy food. The pasta is amazing, sauce tastes homemade. Twists, breadsticks, and salad are perfect and fresh. The canolis are the best we have ever had. There's a little mini store."}
{"text":"We go there often, and Cugino's has another restaurant on the West side. We go to the Maryland pkwy. one often. If you want a pizza like back East, go to Cugino's. I'm from Rhode Island,. All I miss here in NV. is the N. Y. style hot weiners, made like Rhode Island..  Nice Italian family business. Very friendly, and their pizza, Meatball sandwich, Veal or eggplant dinners are super. The only problem is they are only open till 8:00 on weekends. But otherwise everything is good there, they also have a deli with meats, cheeses and various olives for sale. The Best!!"}
{"text":"I cannot believe it has taken me this long to review this place when I ate there like three weeks ago!   I will admit, I am giving it four stars currently only because I need to go some more to really be sure that it is as good as it gets. I am an Italian lover and from an Italian family (by marriage) and I would like to try more of their foods before I give it a five.   This was the first time I have ever been, which is kind of dumb, considering I have been going to school and working at UNLV for the last four years, and only recently discovered an Italian place near by. How silly of me.   I like the way the place was set up. It had neat pictures and memorabilia stuff that made it feel really chill. It also had like a small grocery store like space where you could buy like 20 different types of noodles and other yummy Italian stuff to cook with. They also had this deli like set-up, displaying the enormous amount of meats they sell by themselves, or make a sub with! Pepperoni, Genoa salami, sausage of many flavors, just an abundance of eye-popping varieties.   So, now to what I ordered for my first meal at Cugino's. I had the Penne a la Vodka dish. OH MY GOODNESS! Amazing! I love vodka sauce and other then this pizza a la vodka I had in Portland from a food cart, I have not had good a la vodka pasta anywhere. Here though, it was delicious. The sauce was think, but not too thick, and thankfully it was not too creamy either. It was perfect to me. *Doing that kiss the fingers motion (hard to explain in words).   With the meal you get two bread sticks and a salad and it equaled $15. Which is pricey in a way, but that pasta was so good I did not care.   Now I am not sure if all their food is like that, but my first experience was fantastic and I hope to get back there soon!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I come here all the time with my friends for lunch. Nice atmosphere and the food is great! Staff is nice and courteous."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's unpretentious, casual, deli and many home made items. We ordered 2 spaghetti meat balls(huge), chicken parmesan sandwich, knots (yummy), Italian II cold sandwich, capuccino, tiramisu..... ) yep, too much for 3 people.. but I don't live in Vegas and i just had to get all I wanted. I will definitely go back when I am in town."}
{"text":"Wow! Absolutely delicious!!  Stumbled on this place and its the best I've tasted from NY to Italy. You can smell the freshness as soon as you walk in the door."}
{"text":"I do so love a good sandwich.  The Italian #2 was the sandwich in question and was enough to last me through two meals.  The roll was perfect and the fillings were generous and tasty.  Too bad it's not in my neck of the woods, or I would definitely want to try more from the menu."}
{"text":"This place has the balls! Meatballs that is! And gravy! That's what Italians call \"spaghetti sauce \" those 2 items can tell you the quality of an Italian deli and who's in the kitchen! This place has it , great basic Italian food prepard like grandma made, good job pisan's ! Mangia !"}
{"text":"Delicious. Even got delivery via the Yelp app. Great Italian hoagies, fried ravioli and the meatball sub was fantastic!"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant for the first time on Wednesday with a craving for pizza. A quaint mom and pop shop lined with Italian foodstuffs and a simple deli, I was disappointed to see that they had lunch specials at the last minute. I probably could have saved myself a few dollars ($12-something vs. $5.99 for two honking slices of pizza and an average sized beverage).  The money I spent was well paid. I really enjoyed my calamari (homemade marinara, please!) and my lone slice of cheese.  I will definitely be back to further explore their menu. Can you say, \"vodka sauce?\""}
{"text":"This is the type of old skool italian deli I'm used to finding out on the East Coast.  The people who own it come from the old country (Sicily) and know what they're doing.  Good, no frills service that's quick and efficient.    Now I have a caveat...although I've come here many times I've only ordered the meatball sub, cause it's the best in town. The meatballs are made the right way, covered with a good marinara and mozzarella, then toasted, giving the edges of the bread a crispy texture that juxtaposes well against the tender meatballs.   My only beef with this place is the price.  They used to be really cheap, closer to 5 bucks for lunch, now it's closer to 10.  But they make up for it once I bite into that sub.  A coworker gets the eyetalian sub and it's packed with so much meat he eats on it for 2 days.  But for me, Cugino's is all about the meatball sub."}
{"text":"So much for it being inexpensive, I spent 20$ on a pretty mediocre small plate of pasta with baby clams sauce. Fair to say that I feel robbed. Service was cool but The price doesn't make any sense"}
{"text":"Stopped into Cugino's before the UNLV basketball game to meet friends, not even hungry, but then i looked at all the italian foods on the shelves,the goodies behind the deli counter and the food on the tables and Bam, i had to order something. Wow was i surprised. the food was fresh and delicious, i can't wait to go back and try some of there other items on the menu. Family owned and operated, i felt like i was in my mothers kitchen, waiting to get a slap for sticking my finger in the sauce."}
{"text":"Right off the bat, I would like to say the food at Cugino's is exceptional. By recommendation, I ordered the Donnie's Special Sandwich (chicken cutlets, fresh mozzarella, roasted peppers, balsamic vinegar and oil, and some shredded lettuce and onions). It was absolutely amazing - the delicious chicken cutlet is homemade and the peppers and dressing add a vinegary mouthwatering twist making the sandwich much more Italian-like than I expected.  I also got a few appetizers wanting to try as many dishes as possible on my first and only visit considering I am from out of state. I got a little bowl of assorted olives as I figured you can't go wrong with them (and I was right, they're supreme saltiness was on point), some delectable fried zucchini (served with mozzarella sauce on the side, delicious), and a few garlic knots (also superb).   The aura of Cugino's was refreshing, casual, and authentic. The man who took my order was friendly and helpful with my inquisitions. He was rather surprised I was not from the area, making it seem as though most of the customers are locals, however, he was extremely welcoming and excited to serve us Cugino's delicacies.   There are a plethora of reasons why I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Cugino's; all in all I highly recommend this Italian restaurant to anyone looking for an authentic and memorable meal!!"}
{"text":"We finally found a place that has New York style sandwiches! Red roast beef with lots of oil and vinegar! The quality of the meat and cheeses they use tastes like it does in New York! Garlic knots are the bomb! Pizza is really good too! Wish we had this place in California! Also the people who work here were very nice both times we came in. I noticed some people complaining about that in their reviews. Not true. Just because you don't smile or talk every second doesn't mean your un friendly. When they had time they came over laughed and talked with us and were really down to earth! I will definitely come back every time i go to Vegas!  It's a little off the strip across the street from UNLV. Glad we found u!! =)))"}
{"text":"Food was great until we spent the next 3 hours on the toilet. When called to complain, got nasty."}
{"text":"Again, 5 stars! Why? The Cugino's came from Italy via The Bronx almost 2 decades ago. Mamma and Papa are humble and extremely accommodating whether ordering on or off the menu.  In the 7 years I've been a regular here they've never disappointed.  It's also a small Italian market if you need to grab the real deal ingredients for a perfect meal without any hassle. What? You're not sure about a recipe? Just ask Donnie or Christopher (the sons.) The entire family is happy to help.   Bottom line, from sandwiches to fine dining style pasta dishes, and easily some of Las Vegas' best pizza. Did i mention the scratch salads? Olive, artichoke hearts, potato, Mac, mushroom.  Wait, the fresh sausage and Mammas meatballs.  I guarantee you'll feel like you just visited the Bronx.  Go for it."}
{"text":"What's weird about this place is that you walk in and have that feeling you're in a legit Italian deli like in Chicago or New York. And a lot of people rave about how authentic it is. But for me it has always been hit and miss. The delivery combo(or whatever their supreme is) pizza was soggy and bland. Their spag and Italian sausage was really good but the Alfredo tasted closer to stuff I could get from a jar. It's at times really good and other times way over rated.  I wonder if the authentic feel over powers all other senses."}
{"text":"TRUTH.....The Best Italian Deli in Las Vegas. hands Down.......nowhere else compares,, just go here, no other joint matters........YOUR WELCOME"}
{"text":"We came all the way from Phx, and it was worth it. We took home some thin cheese and parsley sausage which tasted just like home (LI). After we order like pigs and the food was served the own came over to se how everything was, simple perfect. Now I find out the he was the owner of the A&S pork store in Franklin Sq, I ate his sausage my whole life. We loved it and will be back again \"just for the yoohoo\""}
{"text":"I wish more Italian restaurants were like this. When it comes to homestyle cooking, this place is the real deal."}
{"text":"You want to step out of Vegas and into Little Italy for a second? Cugino's is the place to go! The atmosphere is something unique that you can't find anywhere else in the city. Busy displays but clean restaurant overall. The staff was approachable and seemed to be very patient as it was our first time in.   We tried the $10.99 spaghetti and meatballs lunch special, which comes with a drink, and a side order of $3.96 garlic knots to fill us up. The food was awesome! It's so much though, definitely enough to share with two people.   Overall, Cugino's made our dining experience painless and enjoyable. If you happen to be around the area and are looking to get a taste of Little Italy, we would highly recommend Cugino's!"}
{"text":"We recently tried the Sicilian rice balls parmigiana which sent out of town visitors searching Seattle menus for these delicacies.  The parmigiana style rice ball even puts its cousin un-clad in sauce to shame.  Absolutely delicious.  I'm drooling knowing I have one serving still in my freezer awaiting its cryogenic awakening on my breakfast bar!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite place in Vegas for Pizza, subs, and I don't even attempt to make my own marinara anymore. I just swing by Cugino's on my way home and buy a quart of marinara (which is so freaking delicious my kids will eat any veggies as long as it's topped with the gravy from Cugino's.) Awesomely friendly staff and the deli meats are $1 cheaper per pound than the grocery store chain up the street.  LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!!"}
{"text":"Again, another time I am asked to leave a review to a place I already reviewed, so here it goes: I went there on a recommendation from a friend, so my expectations were high. Although you won't find similar authentic quality food and choice of delis in Vegas (run by actual Italian owners), but I have to say, I was a little disappointed. Apart from the decent choices of Italian meats and salads, and the freshness of the food, the taste kinda left a bit to be desired. Bread is a major factor when it comes to delis and pizzerias, and I have to say it was not as much as I was expecting; maybe because my friend's recommendation made my expectations too high. I ordered both a slice of pizza and a sandwich, and I found both their bread and dough about average. Still pretty good, compared to most places, but there is definitely room for improvement when it comes to their bread, especially when you use the word \"Italian\" in the name of the business, and that comes with big responsibilities...."}
{"text":"I have been a cutomer here quite a long time. The food is good ( not the best in the valley by far), but today when I went to lunch, they lost my business. It was simpy a matter of being polite. I wasn't aware that using a debit card cost me an extra fee, when I questioned my total being higher than it should, the man behind the counter was incredibly rude. He asked if I read the sign on the counter, I said no because it's buried among many things. The man continued to be rude. I am not making a big deal about the dollar fee, it's the rock bottom, horrid customer service. I hope it was worth it to be so rude. They've lost a long time customer over a dollar and an extremely rude employee. So long Cuginos..."}
{"text":"After an epic BSB-fangirling weekend with my friends, we stopped off at Cugino's for lunch before driving home.  My friend somehow found this place awhile back and has always bought several quarts of sauce (bolognese and something else) while in Vegas, and she raved about everything they had.  Calamari was ON POINT - so fresh, perfectly breaded and fried, and the marinara sauce was BOMB.  Like the best I've ever had.  Rigatoni bolognese was just okay - I've had better bolognese, but this was a really good portion size, and no one is really going to complain about pasta and meat sauce, right?  Really nice service, and it's close to the airport if you want to ever have a good final meal in Sin City."}
{"text":"Went to Cugino's Italian Deli for the first time last night...amazing!  Had the Cugino's sampler, garlic knots and a pepperoni pizza.  The sampler had fresh veggies, the mozzarella sticks you could tell were made from there fresh everyday cheese...heaven!  The pizza was what the best!  The crust is firm and crisp, served on a \"bumpy\" tray so it doesn't get soft from the heat, again the fresh mozzarella on top!  So good!  I'll be back!  I have to try the rice balls and deserts!!  Go here for the amazing pizza..."}
{"text":"I read the reviews on this place and was so excited. Coming home with my hubby on a 23-hour trip and we were starving. Stopped by this place to grab a slice or two of pizza. We both got the Sicilian pizza and a drink. I thought that the pizza was pretty good, cheesy and hearty enough to fill up two starving travelers. Unfortunately, it wasn't anything spectacular and I noticed my husband didn't rave about it either. I would totally come back here though for their $5.99 two slices and soda deal."}
{"text":"Five stars just for the amazing aroma that hits you when you walk into this establishment! So fresh! I ordered the Italian #1, and the meats and cheese are so delicious! Incredible sandwich. My dad ordered the baked ziti, and it was absolutely incredible! The sauce was flavorful and the ricotta inside of it made it so heavenly! It may be a bit out of the way, but it's definitely worth the trip! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I had shared the Ruben melt and the Pastrami Melt along with the garlic Knots, reasonable, I'll be back."}
{"text":"They have solid pizza. It is NY Style, which I prefer, and the selection of toppings is good. I had sausage and cheese and it was good. Not too greasy and the crust is excellent. I would recommend as it is a good pizza and prices are really low. A great spot for all this students across the street (who I suspect dont realize its there).   I will head back in there and order some whole pizzas to try out the full spectrum of toppings I am able to jam onto a pie. Until next time."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in Las Vegas, hands down.   My Asian ass might not know a thing about being Italian, but I know enough to say that this place is legit-- the food to the service.  My boyfriend and I usually opt for the meatball and parm special. We always salivate over the stuff they have for sale behind the glass, and one day I will remember to bring a cold bag and blue ice to protect hunks of deli stuff all the way back to Los Angeles.  The last time we were there, we saw a girl that looked like a supermodel standing next to a gentleman that could've been the Papa Smurff of the business. They posed for photos and held up the order line for a minute, but none of the people waiting seemed to mind; they stopped drooling over the menu for a moment to take her in.  From the kitchen, we all hear, \"'Ey, check yer blood presshr before you leave!\"  Priceless.   The food's always consistent. Locals, you got a gem."}
{"text":"I'm so bummed out that my new place isn't within delivery range.  Previously, I would order from Cugino's at least once a week, exploring new dishes and savoring old favorites. I've been pleased with every single order. The food is amazing, from sandwiches to desserts.  A few of our favorites that I recommend to everyone:  -Neapolitan Rice Balls, basically fried balls of risotto. I've made meals out of these and nothing else. The Sicilian balls are really good too, but I prefer the meatless ones.  - Seasoned wedge fries. You get a huge amount for a couple dollars and they are the best I've had. Perfectly seasoned and always fresh.  -Homemade Hot Turkey sandwich. My boyfriend would eat it every day if he could. It's basically Thanksgiving on a roll and a little slice of happy.  -Ruben Melt, the best I've ever had. Oh man, now I want one.  -Cannoli. It's obviously freshly made and perfect if you want something lightly sweet and creamy.  -Cheesecake. I'll admit it's not the most amazing cheesecake I've ever had, but it's still damn good. I mostly want to point out that this is the best delivery cheesecake I've found. Most places have sad little prepackaged slices of mediocre cheesecake. But Cugino's has big, beautiful slices that don't appear to have been frozen or mass produced. 9/10, would nom again.  If I keep going, I'll end up listing the entire menu.  To top it off, the service is always excellent. We always got the same delivery woman and I adored her. Super sweet, very fast and professional. I can't recall a single order error and even on busy days, service was prompt and quality was through the roof.   Tl;dr this place is fabulous."}
{"text":"Fantastic! My husband's been coming here for awhile and finally brought me here. The pizza is amazing, their market looked great. I tried their Rice ball and sooooo delicious!  If I wasn't on a diet and needed to stay away from carbs I'd be here weekly. Definitely worth the cheat meal!  Pepperoni pizza and garlic knots are great too. They sell cheese pizza by the slice when you drop in. Not to mention great customer service by the guys that work here making sure we were happy and have everything we need. Impressed!"}
{"text":"I just ordered pizza from Cugino's and it was good. Not just good, but amazing! I'm definitely a big pizza eater. My husband and I eat pizza at least once a week. We have a go to pizza shop in North Vegas called Lino's and Cugino's is just as delicious. I was worried we wouldn't be able to find a legit pizzeria near UNLV and boy was I wrong. I truly believe that you should only buy pizza from an Italian. All in all, if you're looking for a pizza shop then check out Cugino's.   Especially if you're a firm believer that Chicago style is an abomination and a total faux pas!"}
{"text":"We were looking to pick up something fast and on the way to the UNLV tailgate. We agreed upon pizza and I wanted to try something different rather than dominos, pizza hut, papa johns. Found Cugino's on yelp and ordered 3 large pizza - vegetarian, meat lovers, and pepperoni. When we arrived I noticed it was the same place we picked up from a couple years ago.  Right on, as I remembered this place was awesome. All the pizzas were delcious and everyone was satisfied. I also ate a cannoli which was amazing, as we waited for the pizzas to come out."}
{"text":"\"A-OK\" -  That might be pushing it, as I was upset.    I ordered an $8.99 special - meatball sandwich and drink.  I asked how much for fries - was charged $1.99.  Order came to $13.something.  I asked why - and was told it was taxes. I asked to see the receipt and then was told it was also the credit card fee.  Whattttt - thank you for warning me.  She pointed to a sign on the table (buried with all the other hand written notes). I advised her that MasterCard/Vasa regulations prohibited charging a service fee on a debit card and you must have filed proper paperwork to let them know you will be charging a \"checkout fee\". She was not happy I was questioning them - so I asked \"do you feel it is right to charge so much - especially college students, as you are on a campus\" - she said \"everyone does it\" ... ummmm, no, most restaurants do not.  Claiming it cost them money - OK, I get that, but it is called \"SERVICE\"! Plus, you charged me OVER 10% fee ... you are charged - at most 3-3.5%?   Then she said \"why do you think I asked if you wanted to pay cash or card\" - I said \"so you knew which button to push on your register\", she said \"no, so you would figure out there was a fee for the card\".     You lost a new customer because of a stupid fee.  I hope you make enough off others, that you do not mind losing the ones you do for this.  Oh, and one more tip - to go orders, include a napkin please.  Thanks.   Oh - the 3 stars were because the meatball sandwich was OK - not the best - cut in half meatballs - but was tasty."}
{"text":"I am gonna make this short, sweet and OHHHHHH so easy!!!!    The BEST DELI SANDWICH IN LAS VEGAS!!!!!      Family owned, and on site this is like a trip back to Italy, from the pizza made fresh to order, plates of pasta served to order, the cans of Italian tomato sauce for sale, to the cold cuts made into a SIMPLY DELICIOUS Sandwich on a soft rolls that will keep you coming back,TRULY     Easy parking on site, friendly family & staff, across from UNLV perfect if going to an event like basketball, football or concert ~"}
{"text":"this place is bad food quality anymore, was the best time ago, now its all about momey, not the food or us the guest. no more eat here or refer this place. we all can make better at home, no need to go out of your way spend money time effort to get third class product. just do as i do and say no no no, to poorly run business. soon they wake up when the rent is due and nobody is in the dining room.  this is vegas,"}
{"text":"This is some authentic Italian food! Even the decoration and shop set up make you feel like you're in a little Italian market. The food is just as good as other Italian restaurants but its not as pricey. Today I had the meat ball parm sub and let me tell you, it's one of the best subs I've ever had! I'm all for small family owned restaurants and this place is one of the reasons why. It can look a little sketchy at first but I like to keep an open mind. Give this place a shot. The food is delicious and made to order and no, it doesn't take forever."}
{"text":"I would love to be able to give this place a 5 star rating....but.... Our driver was lost 2x and had to call us for directions both x. Pizza was cold. Mozzarella sticks were cold. We didnt get the garlic knots that are ordered, but they have us a salad that was pretty good.  Don't know if I want to spend the $$ to try them again since this fiasco cost us over 40$."}
{"text":"1st time here & not disappointed! Great food & great service.   I love family run businesses. You can see they put their heart & soul into the food.   If you haven't tried this place your missing out!!"}
{"text":"Not very often you have a bad pizza.  I mean it's pizza!!! How can one mess that up?   Well this place found a way to do so.  The crust was very tough hard to bight through.  The Italian does not taste like Italian sausage at all, more like plain pork sausage.  The sauce is bland."}
{"text":"We found this using yelp recommendation. We ordered seven things off the menu and it was all very good with authentic Italian deli taste.was incredibly satisfied and encourage all to try. 5 stars!!!!!"}
{"text":"I just don't get how this place has such high ratings.  The food is so insanely low quality that I just cannot wrap my head around the reviews.  My partner goes here every once in a while because he doesn't want to drive across town for pizza (and because he has admittedly low standards when it comes to food) and every time I give in and decide to get anything from here I'm surprised at how they get away with even selling it.  From several seriously gross prior experiences I knew not to eat the pizza (OLD slimy basil and garlic) or the noodles (basically grease soup), so I got some chicken vegetable soup this time. Not surprisingly, this was a sorry excuse for food just like everything I've ever had at this place.  There was a single piece of carrot, a few pieces of corn and maybe 3 small pieces of what was once clearly canned chicken.  The rest was orzo and salt. I don't like to leave bad reviews but when a place will charge you for scraps of substandard food I can't help but say something.  This place has no pride in the quality of its ingredients or what it is selling people.  Edit:  The cannolis are ok though :/"}
{"text":"I am super picky about deli sandwiches,  omg! Awesome fresh indregidents and homemade bread. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Amazing New York Italian food by actual NY Italians- their food is delicious and they are friendly, despite the gruff reputation New Yorkers usually get. You can't go wrong with the sandwiches, but always check out their specials.  SANDWICHES: Once had a sausage and broccoli rabe special here that blew every other sandwich I've ever had out of the way. It was that good. The #1 and #2 are both solid if you dig cold sandos, the Tony Soprano or Goodfellas are tasty hot options. Regardless which one you pick, they're all served on some of the best bread outside of Italy.  PIZZA, PASTA, & OTHER OPTIONS: Haven't tried a whole pie, but their Sicilian square slices are crispy, cheesy, and delicious. The rice balls are a good, cheap add-on to your meal. Neapolitan is not stuffed, but still delicious. It's basically risotto with a crispy exterior and a side of sauce for dipping. AKA, heaven.  I've mostly focused on sandwiches here, and you can't really go wrong with what you pick from that section. Go in with an appetite!"}
{"text":"Update:  I was back in town and stopped by Cugino's.  I was only here a couple days so was limited on my meals but had one of my meals at Cugino's.  I had the pastrami sandwich on marble rye again and was not disappointed!  It was as good if not better than I remembered.  Can't wait to go back there again!"}
{"text":"I used to come down here more frequently when my sister and I went to school together, and I had a craving for pasta, and I thought I should see if this place was still running. What do ya know...?!  Score!  I used the Eat24 thingy majig to order food ahead of time 'cause I only had an hour dinner from work, walking to and from campus. All good 'cause I only waited like 5 minutes after my pick-up time for the food.  Dudes... I could smell the goodness, and it was bagged up.  Open my food up in the Staff Lounge, and there's this nice bit of steam coming from the top of my Rigatoni Bolognese. The bread was warm, and my salad was all fresh. Oh my gah... I was never let down then, and I wasn't let down tonight.  Same family running it, and they're still one of the friendliest people around =D"}
{"text":"Best pizza in vegas. Old school deli. Italian family biz. Love this place the pasta is old school wt gravy, not sauce. If u are near unlv then u must try this food."}
{"text":"By far the best italian food I have ever had. We tried stuffed shells in the vodka sauce (they said no one had ever ordered them with vodka sauce) and eggplant parmesan. Their marinara sauce really steals the shows. Delicious. We also got the tiramisu and it was better than most other places, but not the best!. Felt like it had been frozen, because I got a couple of ice crystals. I will most certainly go there if I am ever in Vegas again, and highly recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Authentic. Authentic. Authentic. Excellent pizza. Crisp. Not rubbery like most other places where you left it up and all the cheese falls off. Old school. Loved it."}
{"text":"Best deli in Vegas.  Best deli maybe in the county.  I'm in Vegas 4 times a year mostly for work or trade shows and this place is a MUST.  It is family owned and what a wonderful service and quality oriented family they are!  They make their own cheese. They make 100% authentic Italian food. Their bread is OUT of this world. Their food is DELICIOUS.  If you really want a nice comfy hometown spot to sit and enjoy a great sandwich, this is the place to come.  I'm there end of November and can't wait to order sandwiches and salad from here!"}
{"text":"Eyyyyyy, It's a Canoli!!!  Right across from campus and  reasonably priced. Old-school, homey, east coast feel, family-owned and FANTASTIC food.  You can't go wrong.  Had the Italian #2, it was a great size and delicious, if I wasn't so full I would have had another! The garlic cheese bread was great and the marinara was the BEST I've ever had- don't tell my grandmother on my Italian side.  Can't wait to try the Meatball Parm and the Sausage and Pepper sandwiches- mmm, I'm drooling thinking about it.  Definitely going to be going as often as the skinny wallet will allow (it's such a pleasant change from my usual packed lunches that I bring to campus)  I always knew about this place but I wish I tried it sooner!"}
{"text":"We visited this afternoon for a quick lunch - we ended up sitting and chatting with the owner and 2 regulars - all of us former NY-ers comparing notes and sharing stories of \"home\".  As good as the conversation was, the food was even better. Both of our sandwiches (the Godfather for me - eggplant, fresh HOMEMADE mozzarella and roasted red peppers, and Donnie's special for my husband - Chicken cutlets, fresh mozzarella, roasted red peppers and balsamic and oil). We enjoyed 2 cannoli's for dessert and learned they are made with homemade ricotta cheese - which explains why they were so light and creamy.   This is a true family owned and operated small business that I am happy to support, and I look forward to trying more of their homemade deliciousness!"}
{"text":"Literally the best pizza and AUTHENTIC Italian food I've ever had ... Def going back again !"}
{"text":"This place has the feeling of a true New York Italian style deli.   I had two slices of the cheese pizza and added toppings to it.   My total bill with drink rang up to $13.  It wasn't the best pizza I've ever had but it was a very cool experience."}
{"text":"When I walked in and saw the huge Boar's Head sign I figured this place might not be so bad. I was right. So I ordered a pastrami sandwich and they put a good amount of pastrami in it and the bread was good. I will stop by on a lunch break when in the area now that I know about this place. I saw they had some Dr. Brown's Black Cherry so I got one of those to have with my sandwich. I heard about it from my fellow OC yelper buddy, Rohlin so I had to try it! Very good!  You can get oil, noodles, sauce, and more here. I noticed in the case they had homemade sausages (I will be trying these eventually) and a variety of olives. I was going to get a cannoli until I noticed them in the case filled. I prefer when the cannoli gets filled after you order it.   They deliver."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!!!! Has the best food the vibe in there feels at home,  and it's super clean! I just recently went to new york and this was a little slice of new york right here in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Wow great awesome authentic! Helpful and courteous service. Everything in the cabinet looks great! Rice balls so tasty, large has meat inside yum. Garlic bread and fried zucchini were great. The house salad that comes with the meal so big and fresh. Spaghetti with meat ball fantastic. Meat tortellini with vodka sauce yum and lots of it. Baked Ziti sicilian style fantastic. Gnocchi with meat sauce wow  Patrons are so funny and friendly! WILL  come back again &  again....I would be a regular if I lived here!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Italian deli I've been to in Vegas. It's family owned and operated. The people in there are friendly and treat you like family. The food is out of this world. I ordered the hot pastrami and the meat was piled high (great value) it came with thinly sliced red onion and spicy mustard on a marble rye homemade bread. Truly one of the best sandwiches in town. I will definitely return and bring some friends."}
{"text":"Old school Italian deli, no frills just good home made from scratch grub! I've found my new Ruben sandwich. Wife got the lasagna and even the pasta was homemade! Garlic knots are great"}
{"text":"The food was very reasonably priced. We had garlic knots, pizza, and fried gnocchi which were all very good.  The lattes are also very good. The staff is friendly and the place is an authentic NYC style Italian deli."}
{"text":"I have also experienced racists and sexist remarks. I don't suport a bussiness with no respect for its customers"}
{"text":"I'm so glad my co-worker convinced me to join him for lunch at this Italian Deli. I ordered a spinach calzone and it was big enough to feed me for days. Everything was made fresh and was wonderful. I suggest going here if you're really hungry because of the portions or share with someone. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Real authentic Italian food. The Italian #1 is large enough to share with a friend although you may not want to. The daily specials of chicken tenders/fries and pizza are low on cost but not low on quality or quantity. You're given two larges slices of hand tossed cheese pizza piping hot from the over or a plate full of fries covered in 5-6 pieces of crunchy chicken tenders. I've tried the Italian #1 & #2, the meatball sub, the pastrami melt, philly and garlic knots and haven't been disappointed yet. Even my kids love their food. Cugino's is a definate must visit."}
{"text":"Awesome family owned restaurant. Doesn't get any more authentic then this place. Exactly what you expect from an Italian American deli."}
{"text":"The service was very friendly and the food was great. I got the pastrami sandwich and riceball both tasted great and the sizes where very big. For sure will be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Had a pie delivered to our hotel. It was pseudo warm and very short on flavor. More than that, it smelled kind of stale.  If I didn't know any better I'd swear this pizza was made yesterday. And this frakking pizza wasn't cheap!!  I learned my lesson.  When in Vegas never order delivery pizza ever again.  Ever.  And, oh yeah, the garlic knots were just meh."}
{"text":"We had three Different sandwiches and were all perfect. Their special is off the hook."}
{"text":"old school - the owner is most often there. It's a funny place close to UNLV - lot's of students - but solid ministroni and other dishes. Also great and big sandwiches."}
{"text":"Typical New York attitude, not friendly at all. There was no eye contact, no smile, and no suggestions. It was like we were bothering them.  We asked about pizza, and they failed to tell us about the specials. We saw the sign afterwards.  The large white clam pizza($17) was ok, the dough was on the dry side, no flavor at all and it was not raised properly. The pizza did come with a lot of chopped clam. But the large amount of clam made the pizza fishy. Also there was a good amount of cheese, which I think was not necessary.  Personally, I think pizza should be about the dough. Without a good dough, you are just trying to cover incompetence with lots of toppings.  This place is definitely overrated and overpriced."}
{"text":"This place has very good pizza. There is a large selection and the workers were courteous."}
{"text":"I love their pizza! It is the closest to Brooklyn that I have ever had. The only problem is they are too far from where I live."}
{"text":"Visit Vegas for family a few times a year. We recently were in the mood for pizza and wanted something close. Tried Cugino's and it was great. Great pizza ( we had the white pizza) and nice people. Converted my brother in law  - it is his go to pizza now."}
{"text":"Subs.  Heroes.  Hoagies.  Whatever you call them, every city needs a deli that makes them right.  Cugino's does.  Most important element in a proper sub?  It's the bread.  I wanted to like Captiotti's, but their bread is no good.  Cugino's has that proper blend of crispy outside, chewy inside that makes it so great.  Service was quick and friendly; interior is nice and clean with ample seating.  There are also a few tables out front for days when it is not too hot or cold.  I will definitely return to try the pizza, but I can see how if you don't get a slice from a fresh pie, it might not be so great.  A full report will be forthcoming.  But in any case, if you want a great Italian hoagie, Cugion's is the place to get it."}
{"text":"These jerks cancelled our order without warning. The only reason I found out is because I looked at the order tracker after the expected delivery time.  \"Cancelled\" was in small print."}
{"text":"My heart is in New York, my home, but when I'm in Vegas this is the only place outside New York I've ever been to that truly makes my stomachs happy. Fresh everything. Oh, and the people that work there? Phenomenal. I can never recommend this place enough. If you're debating on coming here, go. Enough said, just go."}
{"text":"A lot of meat but that's the only good thing! It was prepared by the same person handling the money with dirty nails. He had been smoking and he reeked. I was expecting pickles or peppers on the side with a pastrami sandwich but nothing! I am totally disappointed. I ordered the wedding soup too but received chicken noodles instead. A waste of $16.00 and I tossed it all in the trash!!"}
{"text":"Best Italian deli in Las Vegas. Pizza is awesome, sandwiches are bomb! Homemade sauce, meatballs, sausage, everything. This place is the real deal. I eat here anytime I'm near it. Fantastic meats, salads, Italian specialties."}
{"text":"Ordered from them, never having been there and never tasting it before.  OH MY It was wonderful and plentiful.  Enjoyed every bite and will definitely order from them again.  Try it,  you won't be sorry, it is delicious.  Also, the salad dressing was the best I ever had."}
{"text":"Wow, stuck inside during the crazy floods, and so happy to find this gem on Yelp that delivers!!!  We did a half-and-half pizza and also a pastrami sandwich, wow, NYC authentic!  I wish we would've found this before our last night here,  but we will definitely go back on our next trip here!"}
{"text":"Very good food- authentic and large portions for the price.  My 4 year old devoured the garlic knots and her cheese pizza.  We shared the chicken wings (hot) and eggplant rollatini....yummy!!  We are here for the week and plan on eating there again before we leave."}
{"text":"It took an hour and a half for delivery and they didn't brink my drink maybe they had an off day"}
{"text":"The greatest family owned Italian deli I've ever eaten at. The food is delicious and the atmosphere is amazing. I felt like I was at home while eating here. The pizza and the pastas are worth every second of the anticipated wait!"}
{"text":"Place looks just like a pizza shop eatery from once you walk in there were good seating everywhere and on the right there's a more classy dinner setting. Eatery looked like they sell Italian goodies as well from drinks to snacks.    For an appetizer I suggest to try the garlic knots. It's a little stuffed bread full of flavor and Italian spices that makes you never want to stop.  Of course my meal will always be a supreme pizza from Italian food, and ugh just delish!"}
{"text":"Delicious hole in the wall Italian deli and hot food spot! Totally reminds me of small shops in other cities. They also sell delicious Canolis! Love the mom and pop feel here and the Sicilian pizza lunch special :)"}
{"text":"Cugino's is hands down THEE BEST authentic Italian Deli in Las Vegas.  The second you walk in the door you immediately feel like you are in an old east coast Italian neighborhood at the corner deli.  This is a family owned business and they are all transplants from New York which makes your experience even better.  They have been in Vegas for 11 years and have been serving real Italian hot and cold deli goodness to the masses ever since.  From the father making fresh mozzarella, the mother creating fresh canolis from scratch with real ricotta cheese, to the son creating killer sandwiches oozing with tons of flavor...this place is THE REAL DEAL.  The food was soo fresh and delicious I had to pick up some fresh meats and mozzarella to go.  They also carry hard to find real Italian market products on their shelves.  WOW WOW WOW... I'm going back tomorrow."}
{"text":"Okay...so I haven't been there in awhile....  had picked up the most DELICIOUS potato salad and macaroni salad!  Are you kidding me? !  In addtion ....a St. Joseph's pastry that was to DIE FOR along with a homemade cannoli!  OMG!!!!!!!  Yes to DIE FOR!  So friggin delicious!  My mom stopped me from eating more..so she could finish it when I wasn't around (Grrr!)   Love this place!"}
{"text":"Half Italian grocery store half deli. I only had the spaghetti with meatballs. The meatballs are beef only, plenty for the meal, red sauce is kinda soupy but tasty. The bread sticks are yummy though. It's like lil French breads, small like the kind at Olive Garden but like French bread. The salad was tasty too. I'd go back for sure. Pricing is good too."}
{"text":"I've been living in vegas for several years and it's amazing that with all the food options and all the  small operators here you can't find good take out pizza.  And I still haven't found it... I'll probably go back and try their pasta but so far I'm not impressed by this place.  First, the smell.  Any good italian deli and/or pizza place has a tasty smell when you walk in.  This place didn't have it and if I was blindfolded walking in I probably couldn't tell it from any other place. Not terrible, but nothing special.  Service was pretty mediocre.  There were at least 6 people behind the counter doing their own thing.  Looked like one of those 'kitchen nightmare' episodes.  I'm standing for the longest time waiting for the guy at the register to stop talking to the two ladies in front.  Then the guy gets my pizza and he asks this other guy 3 times what the total was, 3 times, $22.78 (a bit pricy).  What's my change?  1.22  Okay fine, some places charge extra for take out so whatever.  Granted the pizza was cold by the time I got home but still it wasn't that good.  The crust was soggy and the sauce tasted somewhat like pappa john's.  The sauce killed it for me.  I got the special and the sausage and pepperoni and cheese didn't seem very fresh and the dough was nothing special.  Not the worst pizza I've had but not that great.   I don't get the high reviews here.   I've had better pizza at costco."}
{"text":"Great find. Sandwiches are excellent as are the specialty sausages. The owning family is all in. If you are from back East you will love it. It's a true deli. The are generous with the portions and have great commitment to the customer. Hey try the sandwich named after Donny."}
{"text":"After a day of driving, we ended up having dinner at Cugino's.  We shared a #2 Italian Sub, a small rice ball, and garlic knots.  The knots aren't as amazing as everyone said, but the sandwich was great. Lots of meat and not too messy. We'd come back next time!"}
{"text":"Cugino's is a fabulous Italian deli with delicious pizza and garlic knots. I found this place on yelp and I'm happy we tried it. The service is friendly and it gives you a real Italian feel.  Everything smells absolutely amazing.  I will definitely come and visit when I'm in town again. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"All I can say is that this place is AWESOME.  Great affordable food, down to earth owners/workers, etc..  The portions are big and tasty!  The positive reviews are true.  Walk into the restaurant and it looks like one of those Italian restaurants in New York on TV.  You have all the food products like Tomato sauce with fancy Italian makers versus del monte, pre go, etc..  They have a deli display with fancy cheeses, cold cuts, etc..  These guys are the REAL DEAL!  The only problem is that the parking lot is getting redone, so parking on the street may be hard."}
{"text":"Amazing Sicilian pizza, mozzarella sticks and TO DIE FOR garlic knots! Also a delicatessen where you can buy drinks, deli meats, and countless (pasta, sauces, desserts) other amazing things!  Off the strip and in a relaxing less hectic environment which is a BIG PLUS!!"}
{"text":"i was hungry for true old school italian..... and...   i got true old school italian!!! thanks guys, it hit the spot!!!"}
{"text":"Honestly, it doesn't get much more authentic NY than Cugino's.  Having lived in NY for 21 years before moving to Vegas it's easy to find a piece of home in their incredible pizza (thin! and crunchy) and eggplant / sausage parm's.  The pasta dishes are excellent as are any of the sandwiches from the menu.    Also, the family who runs the deli are some of the nicest people you will meet in this crazy city.  They care about their food and they care about their customers.  It's the best all around.  Great food, good prices, and excellent service."}
{"text":"We moved to Vegas last Fall and somehow ended up at Cugino's. Every visit is the same as the first, great service, great food, great atmosphere. It is owned and operated by an Italian family, I believe at least three generations.  They have some awesome specials that you'd expect to find at a pizza place, and there are also some outstanding Italian dishes. Inside you also find an Italian style deli and shop. This place reminds me of a bodega.   I often go in for the fresh, homemade mozzarella, canned DOP tomatoes, fresh made Italian breadcrumbs, and pasta imported from Italy. The deli has amazing desserts, like cheesecake, cannolis, wedding cookies and even icees. This place is very authentic, with better quality items than you'd find at the local grocer.   They even do delivery through one of those services; we watched the whole process while we were waiting on our own meal and they were really nice to the older delivery woman.   We've tried everything from the wings and pizza, pasta, and even a chicken parmesan sub. Everything is made fresh to order. Whether you are going for hot food or authentic groceries, I'd highly recommend Cugino's."}
{"text":"I've been to Cugino's a whole lot and here are my thoughts.  The pizza there is absolutely the best NYC style pizza in town, hands down. Not only is the pizza excellent, but its consistently excellent. Some places wander in terms of quality, but Cugino's pizza has been great every time. The other food on the menu is real good as well, (I particularly like the chicken parm hero), but it's the pizza that is the big draw.   The other real strong point about Cugino's is the deli.  They have a wide variety of products like Italian cold cuts, fresh cheese, and other on the shelf products that are not easily found elsewhere in the valley.   Cugino's is a fantastic place to drop by for lunch or a quick dinner and always recommend it to anyone who will listen."}
{"text":"When you walk in you find plastic salamis and piggy hams...... pretty cheesy What bothers me is he have some person taxing you if you're paying by credit card giving a discount if you pay by cash; not ringing it The cash register ....hummmm?  Order a couple sausages my fingers were bigger than these things for $10 Back to the point I can't support people that are blatantly try to collect cash for what reason ?  Can you say somebody needs to report these people to IRS"}
{"text":"Have been going to this place for years! We drive all the way across town just for it! My husband is from NY and this is the only place in town he says is close to home! Everything here is good! A must try!"}
{"text":"Me and my boys came here on a suggestion from my girlfriend. And to say the least we were not disappointed. We walked in and instantly felt like we were in Italy.   I got the chicken parm sandwich while my boys got the pizza. We shared it all of course because it was all great. We got appetizers as well, the garlic knots and the garlic cheese bread. Both delicious, but I give my edge to the cheese bread. Good atmosphere and quick service combo'd with the food makes this a must while you're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Very good. First time here. I had a tasty meatball sub for lunch. A little on the small side but top quality meat and sauce. I would recommend this to others."}
{"text":"Customer service 1/5 - they are pretty rude on the phone and when I tried to ask some questions about the menu, the guy was clearly irritated and acted like I was an idiot for not knowing the difference between certain pasta dishes. I also called back less than 5 min later to switch part of the order and they would not let me because \"we already started making it\".   Food 3/5. The Food is alright. The only thing I loved was the bolognese sauce. Their marinara sauce is lacking flavor and tastes like it's made from tomato paste from a can. I definitely recommend the garlic knots over the garlic bread. The bread has these half melted slices of cheese on top of it and was gross. But their garlic knots are delicious-just make sure you like garlic because they are very garlicky! The chicken parm was alright, I've had better and once again I wasn't impressed with the marinara sauce on it.   Oh, and if you order take out or delivery, make sure to ask for a side of parmesan cheese because they don't give you any and you'll want some to add some flavor to the bland sauce.   I gave this place 3/5 because I still have hope the pizza and sandwiches will be as good as the bolognese sauce & garlic knots. This place has potential but they need to work on customer service."}
{"text":"Delicious doesn't even cut it. Mouth watering gets a little closer to the truth. Deli to die for is even closer. If you are looking for a GENUINE Italian Mom and Pop joint in Vegas this is it. We will eat here over and over again. Absolutely incredible."}
{"text":"I really can't say that it's my favorite deli in Las Vegas because it's that and a whole lot more. Everything on the menus is really good. From the pastrami or meatball sandwiches, to the calamari or cannoli's you will not be disappointed. I just ordered the Penne a La Vodka with shrimp and let me tell you, it's so delicious.  Heed my warning, you experience Cugino's once, and you will immediately become addicted."}
{"text":"Hi! I came in to Las Vegas to visit my mom an stopped at a couple family favorites that happen to be closed. Or you needed to be 21..  I Wanted some authentic Italian food an ended up here!! Absolutely amazing family run authentic Italian food, sandwiches , pizza an appetizers etc.  My kids had some pizza an cheese sticks,  I tried one of the favorite Recomended  sandwiches, my mom tried the meatball an my other kids had pizza as well as the anti-pasta ,Excellent stuff, homemade sausage an much more. Deserts as well!! \"Nando\" was very friendly and helpful:)"}
{"text":"By far the best chicken parmesan sub I have ever had in my life! Also the pizza, Italian sub, and rice balls are super good as well! I have been to this place 4 times in the last month and it has always been a great experience!"}
{"text":"I really like this family owned restaurant  for a quick lunch at work. Their menu is great and portion sizes are enough to have lunch and dinner! I shop at their deli for items that I cannot find at the grocery store. The cannolis are great but nobody will ever make better Struffoli than my Dad. I did appreciate the fact that they had some ready made at Christmas time! All in all a great Italian experience."}
{"text":"Real Italian! The best in Vegas. I come here for the best sandwiches. Pasta, pizza and wings are amazing. If you are hungry and want real food, this is your spot. It's family owned and always fresh."}
{"text":"The food was very good. I had a cannoli, Ruben sandwich and a white pizza. All delicious. The delivery service was poor. I'm in a hotel. Don't make me come downstairs and out to the parking lot to get my food. That negatively affected the tip."}
{"text":"Always excited when I drop in at Cugino's! I get my favorite sandwich, which I don't believe is even on the menu. The Donny Special...you can't go wrong. It's a secret so shhhh. Of course they get it right with their pizza. This place is authentic which is tough to find in Vegas. Frank, Donny and Company are awesome! Thanks for the great food."}
{"text":"I read a lot of good reviews about this place I figured I'd come try it out. Really nice little deli close to the college. Absolutely the best pastrami sandwich in the whole city. I will be coming back frequently to check the rest of the stuff on the menu great job guys."}
{"text":"I love this deli! It reminds me of home and my uncle's deli in South Jersey. I always try to stop by before visiting my mom and bring her some bread, cheese and meats like we always used to do back in Jersey. The frozen bread is well worth the four dollars - especially if you miss the bread from back East, because it's from back East!!! Heat it up and be ready to be gloriously stuffed with the best carbs around. And don't forget to top it off with fresh mozzarella or slices of Prosciutto. The family who owns it are Mets fans but that's alright, I can still love my Phillies and I won't hold it against them because the food is so damn good. I can always go in there for a good heckle and trip down East coast Italian American memory lane. They carry lots of Italian brand sauce and tomatoes, and of course - Wise chips!!! Lot's of awesome memorabilia on the walls and great energy."}
{"text":"Their two slices of New York style cheese pizza with a soda is such  a great deal. Best cheese pizza I've ever had. First time trying rice balls and they were also excellent. Wish I had tried the rice balls the last time I was at Cugino's. If only there was a place like Cugino's in my home town."}
{"text":"This is my go to itallian store. Everything is incredible and the staff are incredible. Try the donnies special sandwich."}
{"text":"I have never written a Yelp review, but found it highly necessary to write one for Cugino's Italian Deli & Pizzeria. For starters, growing up in NY and living there about 25 years, I have been fortunate enough to experience a lot of good food in my life, not to mention some great Italian food. Well, I found Cugino's by chance, or in my case, maybe it was the luck of the Irish! So, Cugino's is tucked away in a strip mall across the street from UNLV, maybe a couple of miles from the strip. This truly is a hidden gem. It is the epitome of a family owned east coast Italian deli. In the three days that I was in Las Vegas, I had lunch there twice!  The owners/employees (all family) are extremely courteous and very friendly.  Checking on me during my meal to see how my food was. Everything is made fresh on site and is truly to die for. It's hard to make recommendations because I had the same sandwich, the Donnie Special (with my own little tweak going back to how I got the sandwich in NY), during my two visits. My GF had the large rice ball the first time, prepared by Donnie, parmigan style, and on our second visit, she had a side of meatballs and a side of their homemade sausage. Cugino's \"gravies\" (marinara or meat sauce) were both amazing. I  actually had Donnie freeze some of the marinara for me to pick up when i was going to leave Vegas and head back to SoCal. If you happen to be out and about or even out anywhere near Las Vegas, do yourself and your stomachs a favor and go enjoy this special family owned treasure. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I showed up at this place shortly after landing in Vegas on my way to Zion.  I told the owner I heard good things about this place and he immediately mentioned \"Yelp\", perhaps all the reviews are an \"inside job\".  Ordered the fried ravioli and they were blah, definitely something I would pass on the next time. I also ordered the antipasto which was a disappointment as it was iceburg lettuce, a couple blocks of cheese and slices of deli meat - I didn't even touch it since it looked so uninspired.    Then came the Eggplant Parmigian sub which was good, especially the sauce.  The bottom line...its worth a visit if you are a local but I would not go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"Excellent, had the lasagna and a slice and both were excellent. Plenty of parking.  Friendly staff.  TV's to watch sports. Very clean."}
{"text":"Good pizza and great service. I ordered to my hotel and it arrived quickly and hot. Real good pizza for the money."}
{"text":"A real NY Italian Deli!  It's off of Maryland Parkway directly in the plaza across the street from UNLV's student center (behind the Chipotle).   Pros: -The New York/Italian accents -The fresh Italian ingredients available for purchase -NY style pizza, garlic knots -The rice ball...yum! -My friend really liked his hot pastrami -My sis in law said the cannoli was excellent  Cons: -It's so far from where I live!  I have not found anything like this here on the west coast.  I'm an east coast girl at heart and this restaurant made me feel \"home\".  Nothing fancy about it...pretty straightforward.  Clean, fast, fresh, and inexpensive.  Can't ask for much more than that!"}
{"text":"This is the best NY pizza in the city.  They make their own cheese and sausage and they have great Sicilian style pizza, arancini, and cannoli as well."}
{"text":"Probably the best meal I had in Vegas last weekend.  My brother and I stopped by after flying in. We split the Italian Sandwich and a Meatball parm. The food is great and the people there are really nice. Do yourself a favor and drive out here."}
{"text":"I hosted a get together in a hotel suite and ordered pizzas from Cugino's with delivery by BiteSquad.com.  The pizzas were tasty, fresh and delivered perfectly on time.  My favorite was the meat lovers pizza!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! FRIENDLY!!! DELICIOUS!!!! We had the pastrami and phili cheese steak sandwiches.  Everything was perfect."}
{"text":"This little hole in the wall joint is awesome!  It is very similar to other Italian pizza and sandwich shops in town, but their sandwiches are beyond tasty!  I would suggest the Cugino's special.  The combination of roasted red peppers, fresh mozzarella, balsamic vinegar and prosciutto is heavenly!  The guys at the counter are also very friendly, which is always a plus!"}
{"text":"God, this place is good. To me, this is the best italian deli in the city. it's beyond the fact that it's run by an Italian family, and even beyond the fact they sell Stella Door almond toast cookies. The Sicilian deep dish is spot on, the sandwiches are original creations, the bread is not too soft and not too hard. I haven't eaten a bad thing here ever. They actually cook the noodles correctly. What a no BS place with simply great food."}
{"text":"Had the meatball parmigiano sub and my wife had the antipasto salad. It was amazing. Definitely the best."}
{"text":"Everything I've had there has been excellent especially the pizza.  Probably the best pizza in Vegas.  Makes me feel like I'm back home in NY."}
{"text":"Sorry, guys, I'm just not getting it.  I've been here twice and tried the meatball sub and the lasagna bolognese.  Both were just so bland.  No real flavor to the meatballs that I could discern.  The lasagna noodles were super chewy and doughy.  If the mozzarella on top of the lasagna was supposed to be fresh made, I didn't see it.    I'll just chalk it up to the fact that I like my Italian food spicy and/or with a strong basil flavor.  Maybe I just tried the wrong things.  I won't complain about the Olive Garden generation."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! Had \"the Donnie\" sandwich by recommendation of the owner, consisting of chicken cutlet that changed my life and mozzarella that he later told me he makes in house. The owner and his family were amazing, genuine people that I'd give my business even if the food wasn't as amazing as it was. Go out of your way to get to this place."}
{"text":"Couldn't get past the braying jackass at the counter to find out about the food.  The owner was disrespectful to customers and unprofessional."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for over a decade, so this review is long overdue but necessary and deserved. Las Vegas should be lucky to have this local place because it's still the best overall Italian eatery in the city.   Everything they do here is quality that's consistent every time. Their fries, cannolis, meatballs, rice balls, mozz cheese, garlic knots, and cheesecake are all standouts. Their sauces are excellent and are made in-house.  They have good standard Italian fare such as pizza and pasta, but it's the sandwiches that are their star items, both hot and cold ones. I was even floored by the quality of the non-Italian sandwiches such as the Reuben and the Philly cheese steak. Try them all!  Cugino's is run by a hardworking family who just get it done. After all my years of going, they're still going strong in doing what they do best. The food is still as great and of the same quality as it was a decade ago and I still eat here to this day, which I can't say for most places here!"}
{"text":"Coming from NY I am used to really good italian spots. I'd rate this on a lower scale in NY and wouldn't return. But in Las Vegas I guess it is satisfactory for delivery. I'd rather hit a spot on the strip and pay more."}
{"text":"Old school Italian deli.  Good meatball parmesan sandwich - yummy meatballs, melty cheese, and a generous amount of overflowing sauce.  Deliciously messy."}
{"text":"I needed some pizzas for a large event with my UNLV student club. Not only did they take the order in only a day's notice, they gave us a student discount and delivered right to the UNLV parking lot. Very appreciative of this place.  The pizza was great, too!"}
{"text":"Wow! I got the Italian sub (the $7.99 \"Italian no. 1\" with mortadella) to go and I couldn't resist eating the entire thing before leaving the store. Deliciously built, and very generously portioned! Easily more than triple the meat that say, Subway puts on their footlong. Beautiful, crusty-chewy-soft Italian hero sub roll, too.  While I saw my sub being made, I went out on a limb and asked for \"extra hots\" (what I call hot giardiniera) but got a confused look. Instead, I was offered a \"spicy spread\" for a $1 upcharge, which in hindsight I probably should've taken them up on so I could try it, but then he offered me jalapenos for free - which worked out great.  Be prepared for New York style, no-BS, deli counter rapport. Know what you want (or at least pretend you know what you want?) or else step back and let the next customer go at it. An efficient (albeit slightly intimidating) system.  Always fun to find a new spot in your hometown - especially if it's a good one!"}
{"text":"I know I am going to get some yelper heat for this one, but I was not all that impressed with Cugino's. I thought about it and it's probably because I don't have some emotional connection to the place. The food was good, but it wasn't like I had a cool college memory attached to my slice of pizza. Sometimes food tastes better when you eat it during a special time in your life-- I get it. But for me, it was just pizza.   The food was good-- the quality is what really made this place stand out. Just walking through the door you can tell that this is a REAL Italian joint. The deli was stocked and they had a pretty extensive grocery section where you can buy all the Italian cookies and treats you've been looking for.   Lasagna-- It was very homemade and the ingredients were fresh. You could tell that this was not a lasagna that came out of the freezer. My portion was a little on the wimpy side that night. Kind of looked like it was the last slice in the pan and they had to scrape the sides to fill out its lopsided shape. The lasagna came with a garden salad, again nothing fancy.   Pep & sausage pizza-- Ordered a small aka a personal pan. It was very simple. The toppings were of good quality, but it wasn't all that impressive.  Chicken wings-- Great flavor, but not something that I would order again. The wings were small and not really a meal (even though it was a meal and it came with fries).   Would I come back? Yes. It was good enough to come back, but not a place that I could get excited about. I love to support local, small businesses so this place will always have my money over Pizza hut.   Plus, I am very curious about those rice balls and the cannolis."}
{"text":"I had the $8.99 spaghetti & meatballs with soda special. Hubby had philly cheese steak. The spaghetti & meatballs came with delicious breadstick. It was good for $8.99. The noodles were ok but sauce & meatballs were pretty good. Im not sure of we will return since it is so far from us and it has to be pretty spectacular for us to make the drive. We finished with some Italian ice, orange cream: not so good and lemon: pretty good. If you are in the area and have a craving for homestyle italian with fair pricing I do recommend."}
{"text":"This deli is legit- as in super authentic. Last time I was here I heard a customer ask about the Tiramisu and the guy behind the counter responded about how his mom made it that morning. They are friendly and have the atmosphere of a hole-in-the-wall place run by a close family. Sometimes I get the strange feeling I am in a movie. It is set-up like how a director would imagine an Italian deli in New York would be. I have tried their sandwiches, salads, spaghetti, lasagna, pizza, and most importantly their garlic knots! I could eat their garlic knots everyday, they blow any other Italian place out of the water. DO NOT LEAVE WITHOUT TRYING THEIR GARLIC KNOTS. I would reccommend everything I have tried here - nothing has been less than excellent."}
{"text":"Best Italian deli!  Fresh made motzerella and imported prociutto sandwich is a favorite of mine. I've heard from friends that the pizza and chicken parmesean is great but it's hard to try anything else!! Pretty reasonable in price but the sandwiches can get pretty pricey once you upgrade to imported prociutto but totally worth it!!"}
{"text":"I ate here yesterday after a couple of years of driving past and hearing good things.  I am sorry I waited.  It is a little family run deli with a friendly family staff and several products for sale.  Meats, homemade cheese, pastas, etc all are available, in addition to a wide menu.  I had a sandwich with breaded chicken cutlet, roasted red peppers, homemade mozzarella, balsamic vinegar, lettuce and onions.  Good Lord.  It was one of the best sandwiches I have ever eaten.  The cheese was excellent with a delicious flavor and fresh moistness.  The bread was tasty and overall, all the ingredients just worked together perfectly.  I also had some tasty garlic knots and an arancini.  Now, the arancini did not blow me away as others have said, but it was still good.  I just was too wowed by the sandwich.  Overall, a nice friendly place with a good menu filled with other delicious looking items that I must start burning through."}
{"text":"Really good pastrami and I had the meatball sandwich. The family who runs this place is really nice as others have said and that goes a long way with me at least when it comes to customer service. I am looking forward to trying the pizza since so many have said how good it is. The fact that I say that is a good indication of how good the food is."}
{"text":"Who knew in a little strip mall right across from UNLV I'd find an awesome place like Cugino's. And I thought I've tried everything in this strip mall already. Right in the back from Chipotle and the laundry place everyone probably have used at least once. It's a market/deli/restaurant. You can buy east coast products, pickup some Boar's Head deli meat, and enjoy some hot pasta or pizza.  Check out their lunch specials all reasonably priced. Try either the Reuben or Pastrami sandwiches very delicious, made from excellent products. They are a must here. The meatballs and parm sandwich was alright, messy and feel apart on me. They also have pizzas, Italian ice, canolis, etc which I haven't tried yet. Lots of cans of Napoli tomato sauce. They get busy during lunch and there's tables inside and out. Their fountain drinks are refillable so don't worry if you run out of drink since they give a lot of ice. Excellent service, fast and friendly.  I found my new favorite lunch spot, would've been a 5 if I only kept trying the Reuben. Who am I kidding I'm more than a fan 4.5 star."}
{"text":"Rueben melt was fabulous. Definitely more than I needed. Will definitely make this a stop every time I visit Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I have been here three or four times for lunch. It's pretty close to my work, so it's very convenient.  I have had the meatball parm and sausage parm sandwiches. Both were very good. My friend has tried the chicken parm sandwich and liked that as well.  I've also tried the garlic knots, and while I liked them not sure if I'd order them again. Not because they're \"knot\" good, but because the sandwich fills me up and I wasn't able to finish them. Maybe I'd get them and share.  I haven't tried the pizza yet...maybe next time."}
{"text":"Four of us visited for the first time. We found it thru Yelp--thanks! They close at 8 and we arrived after 7--out of garlic knots. Everything is made fresh so we missed out. Tried garlic cheese bread instead. Good, especially the marinara sauce! Capress salad was good. Spicy Italian sausage sandwich was almost too spicy for me. Should have known with a name like Raging Bull. Also tried the Donnie. It was very good as others have yelped, really worth giving it a try. Chicken parm and cheese tortellini meals rounded out our selections. We all ate everything and are now stuffed. In our defense it was great. Sorry, no room for dessert--so no report on that. Met the owner and his wife--delightful family owned and operated. Highly recommend--they've been in business almost ten years."}
{"text":"I have been going in there for years, outstanding food. I bring several people every time & tip well. Went in, ordered our usual pizza & wings plus other items.  Charged usual price, wings never came. I asked they said I never ordered them. So I asked why I was charged so much & they said that's our usual price!  $70.  I pointed out the prices on their marquee & they said you were charged correctly! If you eat there demand a itemized receipt! I will never return!"}
{"text":"The online menu says a veggie pizza is $9.99. Doesn't say what size, so when the clerk saked \"a large?\" I said, sure.  When I went to pick it up.... $21 bucks?! I don't understand. D:  I probably should have said something, but it was near closing time, so, whatevs.  When I got it home, at least two of the vegetables listed on the menu weren't on the pizza. The ones I was most interested in. Arghghhh"}
{"text":"A must visit. Come hungry and willing to wait, take in the people (everyone from UNLV kids to wannabe-wiseguys), the staff, it's all enjoyable and plucked right from Arthur Avenue in the Bronx. Want an off-the-menu broccoli rabe and sausage rigatoni? You got it. Eggplant parm hero? Perfectly gooey rice balls while you wait for your food? (the big ones have meat inside and are amaze-balls) A jar of Galeffi Effervescente for the next time you overeat at home? Delicious espresso? Some sweet pickled peppers with advice from Mama Leone on how Sinatra liked his pork chops with vinegar peppers? Where ya goin??"}
{"text":"Brooklynites, your search for real pizza in Las Vegas is over.  I probably could just shut up there, but I'll write more, for those of you who require specifics.  I actually almost shed a tear of relief discovering this place today. I've lived in Las Vegas for about 2 years, and I'd just given up on the hope of real Brooklyn pizza. Settebello pizza is good for what it is, more like the pizza you get in Italy. Nothing wrong with that. But when I've had a taste for NY pizza I've always been disappointed. Metro Pizza was suggested to me once by a friend, and after trying it I immediately punched him in the face. Don't worry, he's fine now.   The owners/staff of Cugino's are all Italian from Brooklyn. The place is a deli and italian grocery, so you can buy all the best meats, Italian canned goods, homemade raviolis, manicotti, stuffed shells, as well as marinated salads and mozzarella that they make there DAILY.  The sandwiches are just flawless. Even the little things I've missed like coffee soda they had there.  Honestly I wasn't even planning on trying the pizza. I'd had enough disappointments  on that front already.  But as proud italians and proud New Yorkers, they insisted. And I'm SO glad they did."}
{"text":"Best pizza! Best cannoli!! They can go toe to toe with any pizza I've eaten in NYC or Italy. Get off the strip and eat here now!"}
{"text":"I don't ever write reviews but I feel obligated since I can't get enough of this place.  I am from Buffalo, NY and this place makes me feel write at home.  This is authentic as it gets from the employees to the patrons.  Definitely brings me back to my Grandparents cooking!  I just discovered Cuginos 2 weeks ago and have already been there 6 times, that should tell you something."}
{"text":"It's a family owned business & it's conveniently located right across the UNLV campus. The food is good  overall & they serve big portions. If you're on a budget & in a rush, this place is the best choice."}
{"text":"Best Garlic Knots I've ever tried. It had the right amount of garlic and came with a marinara dipping sauce. Other items we tried were delicious too, especially the Fried Gnocchi. We came here to try the White Pizza to try in comparison to Secret Pizza however this place isn't a top contender. Don't get me wrong, the food is still delicious here. It was also my first time trying cannolis here as well I liked it enough to try this locally to me. I can't always travel to Vegas for the food :p"}
{"text":"We come this place regularly and the food and service is wonderful! The pizza is delicious and the daily specials will leave full as a tick. The rice balls are great too! You won't be disappointed if you try this place!!!"}
{"text":"NOM. NOM. NOM.  My fave is Donnie's Special: big roll, chicken cutlet, peppers and some type of flavoring I am guessing is apple cider vinegar... best part: the freshhhh mozzarella.... My mouth is watering reading this. I miss Vegas.  The owners are a family, and they are all friendly and welcoming. They make fresh mozzarella daily, along with other items. They also sell Italian grocery / cooking items in their store.  Try their garlic knots - YUM. Everything is good.  Oh wait, their Baked Ziti - FAB.U.LOUS.  I can't write anymore (craving them), except TRY IT! you will NOT be disappointed!  Tell Fred and Julia and Donnie hi!"}
{"text":"I just had the Donnie's Special for $8.99.  Breaded chicken cutlet, mozzarella, roasted red peppers, lettuce, onions, oil and vinegar.  It was really really good.  My boyfriend got the Cuginos special sandwich, also pretty good.  The sandwiches are big too, you get a lot for what you pay. i started feeling full just from one half.  So if youre not looking for a big meal, split one or just save the leftovers for later.  We got it delivered to the Excalibur Hotel.  They do not personally deliver to hotels but you can call the road runner food delivery service (roadrunnerfood.com i think) and they will do it for you.  It will cost a little more but the food shows up hot and ready to go.  I will probably stop by there later to try the fried raviolis and rice balls   Highly recommend this place  ___________  edit: raviolis and rice ball was blah.  But i will still come back here every time for those bomb ass sandwiches."}
{"text":"The food was decent, but the service was terrible.  I ordered online to pickup.  I got a call 10 minutes later that they were out of garlic knots.  No problem.  Take them off.  When I get there I find out that there is a $5 charge to order online even if you pickup and it's no more to deliver it.  Well OK I guess, but that stinks a bit.  I get home and the item that I was most excited about, the tiramisu, was not there!  I call them and it is a rather lengthy call and no one wants to deliver it to me even though I paid for a delivery.  No one knows how to refund it either so I guess they are going to credit me back in the morning.  It is only 6:45 pm now, why can't I get credit now?  Why is this call taking so long - my food is getting cold.  Holy smokes I better check my credit card statement to see that I am not quadruple charged for this.  What a bunch of hassle.  I think I'll save a gray hair and just order from somewhere else.  Ugggg."}
{"text":"I've should've written this review years ago when I first got introduced to cuginos. That don't matter, the food speaks for itself. I lost hope in finding real brooklyn pizza when I moved here from NY.. but once I found this place vegas got a little better .. If you've never been to NY this is the place to have real ny pizza, or anything else they serve. It's all amazing"}
{"text":"I have lived out here in Vegas for so long, about 20 years. I'm originally from Jersey City so I know how good a pizza pie should be. I'm so glad I finally found THEE pizza. Tastes just like home in NY and NJ, the pizza that I grew up with. Not only is their pizza the best but there deli sandwiches, homemade tiramisu, and most importantly their sauce is extremely legit. I highly recommend this place. Again, so glad I found them."}
{"text":"This place is on point. Feels like a legit Italian dive. The rigattoni bolognese is incredible. The meat sauce is tangy and flavorful. Pasta dishes come with breadsticks and salad. The portions are generous.  The pizza was out of this world.  The cheese was so gooey and fresh.  When you grab a slice,  the cheese stretches like on commercials.  The ingredients are high quality and well blended.  Got the eggplant one and the garlic and basil were incredible. Oh and don't forget to get a cannoli. They are fabulous.  Best I've had in the states.   All in all, this place is a gem. Worth an Uber if you're visiting the city."}
{"text":"Ok... when their cheese pizza is everything you hope to taste in a pizza.... you know it's legit! This place is a mom and pop shop, with awesome dishes.   But let me talk about their cheese pizza... not the Sicilian style, but NY style...  They get it right!!! Thin crust, but the crust is CRISPY underneath all the delicious cheese! It seems that's hard for many Vegas pizzerias... maybe cuz I normally order meat lovers. But their pizza crust was perfectly toasted. Even the flipping Parmesan cheese made their slice fire!!! And the sauce was sweet. And a slice is $2.50. I've had the Sicilian slice, but I prefer NY style pizza all the way.   With that said, my husband loves the sandwiches. My daughter got some chicken soup and I could swear there is an Italian grandmother in the back who cooked that soup up!!!   My husband, who is a NY a native, describes this place as a \"gold mine.\""}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!!! Taste like it was straight from Italy... perfect amount of cheese, pepperoni, and thin crust."}
{"text":"Had lunch here while in the area and was really surprised how authentic and delicious the food was. I wish I had a place like this where I live.  We had meatball and chicken parm subs. Packed with meat and yummy sauce, perfectly crisp roll. We also had a slice of cheese and garlic knots. I wanna go back and try all the pastas. This place is a gem!"}
{"text":"This is a lunch staple in this neighborhood. Lots of options hot and cold. Old school neighborhood type Italian deli, like east coast style - but in Vegas. Lots of charm and great great fresh food"}
{"text":"Great pizza, one of the best Margarita pizzas I've eaten. Outstanding cannoli and cheese cake. Friendly service. Garlic knots were great, the sauce was wonderful. Plan on eating here again when we visit Las Vegas."}
{"text":"when you want pizza! this a great place to go. nice friendly staff, good food. lots food items to chose from. great specials too. what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, great food!  The garlic knots were awesome, as was the stuffed pizza.  I love the small mom and pop type of restaurants and this is exactly what it felt like eating here.  I will def. be back."}
{"text":"Finding a place for a family of 8 in Vegas isn't easy, but at Cugino's we felt right at home. Not only is the food absolutely amazing, the staff is exemplary. We enjoyed Margarita Pizza, Shrimp Alfredo, Garlic knots and cannoli's our table, all were homemade and fresh. Highly recommend the short drive to this gem."}
{"text":"I could go nuts in here!  Everything looks so good, I only ordered a salad, but got a hero for my husband so we'll see what he thinks!"}
{"text":"Good to find  a true Italian deli. Actual meat on the sandwich and tasty at that. Grazie."}
{"text":"By far the best authentic east coast style Italian deli in Vegas. You can come here to dine in, take out, or get specific Italian meats and cheeses. My personal favorites are the buffalo mozzarella, ricotta salata, and the pecorino Romano. If I'm dining, I switch it up between the spaghetti Bolognese, cheese raviolis, or sausage & pepper sandwich. And I NEVER ever leave without a fresh hand made cannoli, or an assortment of Italian butter cookies. If you're ordering for a holiday, call it in! They get very busy. Family owned and operated. Good people, great food. It truly reminds me of my grandmas cooking!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Highly recommend if you are in the area. Wonders are nice. Good taste home made. Authentic Italian products are sold in the store. Will visit again when in Vegas."}
{"text":"Love this place. The pizza comes in huge foldable slices. The garlic knots are small, but pack a big punch of flavor. The fried gnocchi might be my favorite thing of all though. They're tender and full of flavor. The marinara is the perfect dipping sauce for them. Been here a couple of times and everything is always great."}
{"text":"Decided to drop by for lunch since it is near my office.  Never been here before.  Glad I stopped by.  They had stuffed cherry peppers!  Oh my goodness......so good.  Will return and try their pie next time."}
{"text":"Solid. I had the Italian slice, and Sicilian alongside a side order of a CANOLI. I've actually never had a CANOLI before, it was really, really, sweet and delicious and probably super unhealthy, but who cares, when you're here, your family, and not calorie counting, right!  The deli section was impressive, and straight up a little italy in Las Vegas.   Oh yeah LAS VEGAS PIZZA is greater than LOS ANGELES."}
{"text":"This is a great place! I can't believe  how  many times I passed this place and never noticed it. I decided  to try it and got an authentic new York feeling (never been to NY but I imagine they know a thing or two about a then tic new York food). So I decided to try the pastrami melt and fell in love with it and I would  only order that sandwich on several occasions, nothing  else. So a few nights back my wife was going to order pizza from a place I'm not fond of , I suggested she order from cuiginos  and she picked up a  ny deep dish.i had never tasted a sauce so original  it was amazing .I'm so used to pizza chains that I had not expected  the pizza to be that good but it was great. Last night we decided  to get a another pepperoni pizza and wings but not deep dish (pan tossed I think) it was even better .the people who work there and give a real authentic  family vibe and positive  service. I can't wait to try more things on their menu. Good job cuginos and I will continue  to recommended them to everyone  I can."}
{"text":"If people ever ask me what ethnicity I am, they usually say something like...\"What are you?  Italian?\"  I guess it has to do with how I look and the fact that my name is Vince.  Turns out, I am not Italian, but for 45 minutes last Saturday...I felt Italian.  Cugino's is exactly what I look for in an Italian deli.  Pasta and cans of tomatoes on the shelves, a nice selection of meats, cheeses, olives, and sausage, and a couple old school guys behind the counter with white shirts and white aprons.  I walk up to the counter to the appropriate greeting of \"How ya doin?\"  I respond to that question with the appropriate answer (which happens to be the same question) \"How ya doin?\"  The guy behind the counter then asks, \"Whaduya havin'?  We ordered the Italian Combo#2 and the Meatball Parm sandwiches, a couple bags of chips, and drinks.  The total came to around $20 and we both left stuffed.   The Italian sandwich came loaded with salami, capicola (gabbagool), provolone, and I asked to add some pepperocinis.  Don't forget about the bread, which is the key to the success of this sandwich.  We will be heading back in our next Vegas trip for sure.  This is a nice lunch option and break from the smoke filled and overpriced casinos."}
{"text":"Love this place. Pizza by the slice are a surprising large slice. The antipasto salad ingredients were fresh with an awesome house dressing. Definitely would recommend this little gem before leaving Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Cuginos is my favorite deli on the East side of Las Vegas. I have tried their pepperoni, pastrami and capocolla deli meat and it's delicious. Their products are always fresh and cut thin just how I like it. I'll always come back for more. I highly recommend cuginos to everyone."}
{"text":"This place screams authentic Italian from the  minute you step inside. Was in a hurry so I just grabbed a ready made slice of pizza and some garlic knots. Pizza was good, but was just a boring old slice of cheese. Garlic knots were legit and my kiddo, who's the pickiest eater ever, gobbled them up and requested another order.   Sat next to a couple who ordered an entire white pizza and it looked amazing and smelled even better. There was some big Italian dude there who is friends with the owner, and he was more than happy to rave about his favorites on the menu. He swears the Donnie sandwich is the 'best you'll ever have.' Can't wait to get back and try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"Excellent!!  Great pasta and sandwiches. We will visit again when we come back to Vegas. Robert R"}
{"text":"Favorite unassuming place for Italian food. Great Reubun sandwich w/ no shortage boar head deli meat. Also the spaghetti and meatballs was right on point. It will remind you of a family run Italian restaurant in NYC.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Been coming to Cuginos for about 4 years now and I'm never disappointed. I keep it simple and I'm always happy. Either the Italian #1 or #2 add the spicy giardiniera Best sandwich in town. Girlfriend loves the rice balls and the cannoli. Sweet and simple but oh so good and why I come to Cubinos 3-4 times a month."}
{"text":"Came to Vegas with my wife for a business trip and we planned to eat off the strip to 1-save money but mainly because we enjoy eating at smaller places away from all the entertainment areas.  Authentic italian and the Italian 2 sandwich was so good.  My wife had a meatball sub that she enjoyed.  This is an authentic place ran by authentic people."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this place! My husband loves green olives and so we tried those and we were not disappointed. I'm from St. Louis so I was very interested in their fried ravioli and WAS NOT disappointed there either! Tried the cheese pizza (good), tried the spaghetti with meatballs (good), garlic knots (good), and pastrami sandwich (really good). Everything we tried was good and we would totally come back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I'm from New York and this place would thrive even there.  They fly in frozen loafs made by hand back east.  You just can not beat that!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!  We have been going here for years and always bring our out of town guests for their amazing food.  We have tried most things on the menu and they are all great.  The cannoli's are the best in town.  Pizza, sandwiches and pasta dishes are all outstanding.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We order delivery from them at least once a week through Eat24. So yummy. And their ranch is seriously yummo along with the rest of their food. Have had chicken fingers, wedge fries, eggplant parm, veal parm, chicken milanese, a few different flavors of Italian Ice, tiramisu, linguine with clams(white & red), alfredo, chef salad, Italian #2, hot turkey sammie and more. I would order each again and well, we already have!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, nice staff and affordable. Great for a quick slice by UNLV. I had the garlic knots and a slice of cheese pizza."}
{"text":"Best Italian Deli in Las Vegas, HANDS DOWN! These guys are straight from Staten Island and they treat you like \"La Familia\" High Quality ingredients are the key here! Everything is made in house from scratch."}
{"text":"I really do like this place, the staff is pretty friendly. The only problem that I have is, they are way over priced. Their ravioli that they fly in from Brooklyn, NY which is very good, however, they charge I believe $12 for a box of what I believe to be a pound of ravioli. Then, when they ring you up, they have a calculator next to the cash register. Instead of ringing you up, they doodle the prices on the calculator. I worry that they are ripping me off, I don't like that at all. Other than the few criticisms, I like this place."}
{"text":"how can i simply put this?? cugino's is the best deli and pizza place in las vegas!!! that is all."}
{"text":"this place is awesome!  my wife and i had the pastrami sandwich and the fried gnocchi.  the fried gnocchi was out of this world.  our sandwiches were huge we could have split one and been full.  we also got cannolis which were delicious. the guys behind the counter were very friendly."}
{"text":"The taste and feel of N.Y., need I say more!!! Upon entering the deli I immediately felt like I was in NY, ordering a pizza I put the place to the test. The crust was thin and I could hear it crack as I folded it in half....mmmm that's the way it's suppose to be, I took a bite and knew I finally found my favorite pizza place after 22 years in this town! Upon my second trip here I decided to try the Cugino Special sandwich...prosciutto, roasted red peppers, fresh mozzarella, and balsamic vinegar, with red onions added on...perfection, I closed my eyes for the first taste and I do believe along with the angels singing I could here the traffic, subways, and steeet vendors! I highly recommend this deli if you are looking for an  authentic NY Italian deli!"}
{"text":"Today my girlfriend and I decided to try this place based on the reviews. Let me tell you it did not dissapoint us a bit. They were really busy at lunch time but the food came out quickly and was very tasty. We got the Cugino's special sandwich and the spaghetti with meatballs. The sandwich has real fresh motzarella cheese and good quality meat the bread was crusty and soft and fresh all at the same time. The spaghetti was excellent pasta cooked perfectly and to order. The meatballs were not bland had really good flavor. If I only lived. Closer to this place I would eat here probably 2-3 times a week."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday after a day at the pool and had plenty of drunk friends me. After reading previous reviews we decided to try this place out. WORTH EVERY STAR!  We tried about 7 different dishes and we're not disappointed in one of them.   The wings and pizza combo is worth the drive over. Best wings I've ever had. They are crispy yet tangy.   Pizza was amazing. Great crust and sauce.   Meatballs will make a vegetarian cross over.   Even the breadsticks were on point.   We will be grabbing some of the wings for the drive home and will be back every time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"From past experience, it seems like every Italian deli I happen to go to always seems to have good eats whether it's pizza, sandwiches or pasta not to mention the selling of good products like deli meats, olives, cheeses, and of course bread!  Cugino's fits this criteria. As you come in you see all the deli meats (Boar's Head is what they are representing), pizza and garlic knots behind the glass case, and Italian groceries lined along the walls.  I came for lunch so something hot was what I was looking for. On their menu I see all sorts of hot sandwiches from meatball and pastrami to Italian sausage and several aptly named sandwiches (which I am more than happy to check out the next 20 visits or so!)  I went with my all time favorite, Philly Cheesesteak with all the fixins'. It is I would say about 8 inches in length cut in half. From my pic you can see the melted mozzarella on top of grilled, thinly slice peppered meat mixed with green peppers and onions. Man, my mouth is watering just typing this. As for the bread, WOW! Crispy on the outside, soft and warm on the inside. One bite and I knew this bread was freshly baked here because I could probably eat the bread by itself.  Service was great from beginning to end. I came in, ordered, sat down, and they brought my sandwich out to me. From that point on, I didn't get up until I finished my sandwich.   The atmosphere has that New York/Italian feel to it. On the walls are posters of New York teams like the Mets, Yankees, Knicks, Jets, and Giants. This place is exactly what you find on the corner of just about any street in New York.  Overall, I cant wait to come back and try everything else. These guys are kind of hidden in this plaza towards the back. Once you find it, you will definitely remember where they are from now on."}
{"text":"I have been converted. I am usually a Chicago style pizza lover, but Cugino's has made me go to the other side. Upon drooling over the deli case, I wanted to try everything, but I had to talk myself down to 3 items, I can always come back. I chose the meat Arancini (rice ball) and a stuffed pepper and one slice of cheese pizza. The stuffed pepper was so delicious I wanted to go back for more, but I restrained myself. The Arancini was delicious, and my pizza was perfect, one of the first times in my life I didn't want ranch to dip it in. The crust had a perfect amount of crunch to it, and the slice had a perfect folding diameter, you may need to blot the cheese a couple times, it was a little oily. For dessert I took a box of pizzelle's home with me. It was like Xmas in June. I can't wait to go back and order an entire tomato basil pie to eat, errr I mean share."}
{"text":"Best authentic NY pizza in Vegas, hands down. Garlic knots are phenomenal, fresh, and soft. Pizza made fresh on the spot. Delicious; no doubt a winner for Vegas' best Italian!!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Cuginos for years now.  I'm from New York and I think I've told just about everyone I know from there this place.  The pizza is the best you can find her in Vegas, but all of the other food is just as good.  I've been buying his meat sauce for a while now, it blows any of the bottle stuff you find in the grocery stores here.  I could not even begin to tell anyone what my favorite dish is because I haven't have anything that is not good.  Go and enjoy........."}
{"text":"The Donnie Special is one of my favorite sandwiches in all of Vegas. Love the feel of this place. Reminds me of the delis back east where I grew up. I've never gotten something here that I don't enjoy. Really good fries, great chicken parm sandwich, salads, and pizza of course. Everything on the sandwiches are fresh. Cannolis are great, small or large."}
{"text":"Let's just say it 3 Guys you have nothing on Cugino's. OMG my son has told me about this place and I have been dying to go here for some time. It is a very popular place for many of the UNLV students and there is good reason. The storefront is like walking into little Italy, it is a very happy and an open atmosphere. Right from the start it smells like those old fashion deli's that use to be here in SF. I knew right there I was in heaven. The counter has many delicious salads and of course desserts like this delicious silky cheese cake which I ordered. They also have many delicious cookies and Italian food which gets shipped from New Jersey. The family who runs this business are very sweet and welcoming. They welcome you with a warm smile and it's like being on the East Coast when you hear their accent it is absolutely charming.  Now let's talk about the food, I finally had like a real calzone and I mean it was so delicious and bigggggggggggg. The sauce was so amazing and it was fresh so you don't get heartburn like you would from business that use canned products, this sauce was made fresh and from scratch.  I barely could finish it and Timmy had this Italian sub and my brother also had the same thing as him. The sandwich was a true Italian sub and again since it is all made fresh you don't experience any heartburn.   We also bought these delicious Italian cookies. So I encourage all who go to Vegas stop by this shop, the prices are cheap compared to what you would pay in the Bay or on the strip and again you have real Italians from the East making this food and a REAL CALZONE! Next time I am going to go for their famous pizza which they are known for all over Vegas as having the best pizza. I am not going to lie though I am going to have that cheese cake because I haven't had one that tasted that good since the Elk's club and again that was made by Masonaries :} from the EAST COAST. :}"}
{"text":"Five stars! Ten stars! One million stars for this place!  I'm Italian and love to try different Italian restaurants whenever we go somewhere new. I can honestly say I have never had better Italian food stateside. It's THAT good! I took my family here after finding the yelp reviews and I am so happy we did. Every single thing was homemade. The homemade ricotta is the creamiest, best, melt-in-your-mouth cheese I've ever had. The sauce is making my mouth water thinking about it. All the bread was fresh from the oven. I would seriously eat there every damn day if we lived in Vegas.   I begged them to open one in San Diego. Ill run it for them and eat all the profits.   Bellisimo!"}
{"text":"Ordered through Bite Squad.  Got my order just as I ordered online.    Ordered Sicilian Slice, Sicilian Rice Ball  Parmigiana and Cannoli.    The Slice was very good.  Came hot and was a square about 6\" x 6\".  Very crisp thick crust good amount of cheese and sauce.  I like thinner crust but it tasted very very good   The rice ball.  OMG.  Let's start with the sauce.  First of all it was like Momma made.  Rich fresh ingredients tasted like fresh tomato and basil little hint of sweetness.  I could have eaten spoonfuls alone.  The rice ball was tender and full of goodness.  It's a meal alone.  The ricotta was fresh and just enough.  Unbelievably good.  A must try!!!  The cannoli was cold (most of the time you get these delivered and they are warm).  It was crisp the center was creamy and there was just the right hint of cinnamon on the crust.  Amazing.    All in all it was delicious!!   I will be ordering again and again!!!"}
{"text":"I've ordered pizza here online. I ordered right before they closed. I didn't know it at the time. An hour later I called wondering if my order went through and boy I got an ear full from the older Italian woman who answered. Lol I swear it was like listening to one of my aunt's going off about how I should know better. I found it uncalled for but amusing at the same time. I guess it's an Italian thing. 5 minutes later my pizza and rice balls arrived. The pizza soooo good tastes home made. The Rice Balls were ok. My aunt's are better. But anyways real Italians know real Italian food and this is it for pizza!  I can't wait to go in and get some deli!"}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious food! We visited Vegas and came across this Italian gem. So glad we did. Love love love places like this. You can tell the food is all homemade and fresh!"}
{"text":"New Yorkers living in Vegas... I have been ordering pizza from Cugino's on Maryland for about 4.5 years. These guus are the best, they are all from Brooklyn and they know how to make a great New York Pizza. Today I deviated from pizza and got a deli sandwich... I am blown away! It reminds me of being back in NY... I strongly suggest you check them out!   http://cuginositalian.com/mobile.html their. Website is pretty bad but the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"YO, DAT CANNOLI THO  Seriously. Their spaghetti and meatballs were meh. I bet their pizza is great, I bet a bunch of their other items are amazing.  But I took ONE BITE of that goddamn cannoli and it knocked my socks off.  Cannoli are done...so bad...like...wow. No one knows how to make a proper one, except this place.  Sooooo, I bought a dozen as gifts for friends. And one more giant one for myself. Because reasons."}
{"text":"I'm a pretty picky eater, especially when it comes to pizza.  I don't like it real fancy or real saucy.  So I am always hesitant to try new places.  But let me say, this place did NOT disappoint!  The pizza was delicious!  My son also said his buffalo chicken pizza was the best he had ever had! We will definitely be back next time we are in Vegas!  The staff was also very friendly!"}
{"text":"I went there a few days ago, and had the Rigatoni Bolognese (sp?). It was most excellent. The sauce was to die for. The serving was quite generous, and the price very reasonable. No atmosphere, but, in my case, really good Italian pasta."}
{"text":"My sandwich was delicious and definitely worth waiting for during the busy lunch hour. I also ordered the fried gnocchi. I love gnocchi so I was excited to try. They were okay, but I was definitely hoping they'd be better, especially for the price. Stick with the sandwiches. (The pizza looked good--maybe next time!)"}
{"text":"Finest traditional Italian food in Las Vegas!! Great service, and friendly faces. Family owned and operated. Atmosphere reminds me of little Italy. It's like having a meal at an Italian friend family home. A must have ever time you visit Vegas. Lots of Parking and seating. Easy to locate on any mobile navigation app."}
{"text":"This place taste like Italian food. Simple menu, delicious deli no crazy Americanized dishes, simple good ingredients. Tried the spaghetti and meatballs lunch special. Huge plate with a soda for 9.99. Atmosphere is cool not noisy, decorations are nice and the place is clean. Try it out."}
{"text":"Love Cugino's!  They're the sweetest, and the food is so good.  Donnie Special is my go-to, but sometimes I get a side of meatballs.  They're too good to pass up.  Oh and have a cannoli too, if you go!  The entire experience from beginning to end is home.  :)"}
{"text":"Italian #2 Perfect amount of oil/vinegar, good portion meat + cheese, AWESOME bread. Downside = Boars Head Meats.. What a shame nitrate infested garbage meats. Ordered fired zucchini wow maybe a few steps better than carls jr. Prob pre frozen etc.. Were not good @ all very disappointing in such an authentic style place Overall - Great sandwich just too bad they use crap meats with nitrates. I would go back and buy some bread then get some non nitrate meats to put on their breads maybe ill buy cheese from them to give them a little extra business.."}
{"text":"You want to feel your like in New York than this deli is for you! The pizza is great and the pasta is awesome as well!"}
{"text":"This place was a really good find. Combo mini Italian market/deli and restaurant. I had the chicken parm sandwich which came on a hoagie roll and it was super good and fresh. Perhaps a little pricey at just under $10 but it was really good. If you're looking for a lunch place that serves good, fresh food; has some character and that isn't the same 'ole sandwich shop, this could be your place."}
{"text":"Walking into Cugino's it's like you walked into a deli somewhere in NYC. I'm a sucker for authentic Italian food, and Cugino's is where it's at. Reasonably priced in my opinion, great quality food, and friendly service. Their meatballs are to die for and their canolis are delicious! Definitely a must try, and it's so convenient being right across the street from UNLV!"}
{"text":"Had the baked ziti. I asked the dude what it was and he told me it was meat sauce, penne, and cheese baked. It ended up being some weird pink sauce. ( not vodka sauce ) and was mixed with ricotta and had absolutely no flavor. How disappointing."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best deli west of the Mississippi! I really hate to give Cugino's an awesome rating because then it will become too crowded and I won't get a table when I am in town. Without a doubt the best Italian deli food in Vegas. In a town with thousands of restaurants, that is saying something. And, the service is tremendous. Everything is done with class and lots of love...you really feel it. Go and taste what all the students at UNLV already know. I can't wait until October when I am back in Vegas."}
{"text":"Yelp comes through again.  I was craving some pizza--east coast/NY style.  Thanks to Peter A.'s pictures/review of Cugino's, I decided to talk the fiancee into picking up a pie.  Half plain, half pepperoni.  In the three years of living in Vegas, this is pretty darn close to being an authentic NY style pizza.  The dough was thin, foldable, and slightly crispy.  The sauce was not overpowering, thin, but had enough flavor to compliment all of the other ingredients.  Gosh, I hate when I buy a pizza and it has clumps of tomato--I didn't order a salad!  The cheese...was perfect, ratio, flavor, etc.  When the fiancee got the pizza home, I even noticed a beautiful grease spot on one of the corners of the box (love)!  I know I've been praising the pizza forever now but, I just want to mention the fiancee's Easter Pie.  While he was waiting on the pie to be done, he asked the owner what the \"thing\" in the case was.  He said it was Easter Pie.  The owner cut off a slice for him to try, for free!  Todd tried it and the rest is history.  Needless to say, he bought a huge slice for himself.    I did mention in the 3rd sentence of this review, I sent Todd out for a pie (one, singular, uno item).  Well, as you know up until this point that he comes home with the pie and the Easter Pie.  He also bought a meatball sub.  Give 'em (men) an inch, they take a yard.  He said it was good but, too much sauce.  Thank you Cugino's for keeping it east coast, and Peter A. for your helpful review and pics!  Cugino's we are fans and will continue to drive from the opposite side of town to inhale your food!"}
{"text":"I love this place for everything BUT their cheese steak sandwich. I ordered one to go, was quoted 10 min but ended up 30 min....but whatever, it was lunch rush etc.  My issue was with the sandwich itself. The meat had no flavor, so probably wasn't seasoned. The onions were caramelized, which gave the sandwich a sweet taste. This wouldn't be such a problem had they properly seasoned the beef, which would have balanced the sweetness of the onions. Next issue was the cheese. They just melted some on top and didn't actually incorporate it into the meat, which caused the beef grease to saturate the bread making parts of the sandwich inedible.   I give 3 stars, because everything else I've had has been on point. But if you want a good cheese steak, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"What a fun, throw-back Italian deli. I had a great meatball sandwich. I want to go back and try the pizza."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place out.  Garlic knots were just as everyone says.  Very good but the styrofoam plate they served it on had a microwave hole in it. I thought they say you shouldn't microwave styrofoam bc it releases unhealthy chemicals or something. Maybe I'll just get some to go and throw them in my toaster oven.  We also ordered the large rice ball (which has meat where as the little one don't)  with the upgraded Parmesan cheese and tomato sauce .  It was interesting but the taste was dominated the rice and tomato sauce. One thing peculiar was that portions of the rice ball was still cold.  The reason for the low stars is my gf and I got pretty stomachache and spent a better part of the day running to the bathroom. We're guessing it was the rice ball. Maybe they weren't thawed correctly or were a little old.  The place had a NY deli feel. I will go and try the NY pizza slice but after some time to forget today's stomachache."}
{"text":"Where to start? This place is absolutely amazing. It's really convenient for students since it is just across the street from UNLV. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu, to be honest. I usually get the Italian-2 cold sandwich, but I'm trying to cut meat out of my diet and I was pleasantly surprised that this joint has vegetarian options! The eggplant parmigiana sandwich was extremely delicious, as well as their rice balls and garlic knots. It's a very homey feel here; service is always spectacular and friendly. Always will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Authentic, hot and fresh! Great whole in the wall with great food. Friendly staff. Try the godfather if you are a fan of eggplant. It was very tasty."}
{"text":"Being from the east coast- north jersey. I expected more. The cheesesteak was nasty and tasteless- and the service seemed worse. Like I was bothering them. Second time here/ first time so- so. I won't be back"}
{"text":"Omg I've been looking for NYC style pizza for so long and I finally found it in Cuginos!!!!  You don't understand how happy it makes me feel!  The crust, the sauce, the amount of cheese, just perfection!!   I ordered through postmates since I am 2 miles out of their own delivery zone.  I ordered a slice, a penne ala vodka, side salad and a cannoli along with an Italian icee.  Omg, the icee brought me back to my childhood in the hot and humid NYC weather.  It was beautiful!  The pasta was cooked to perfection and it was a HUGE bowl, it took me 2 days to finish it.  The cannoli was kinda tiny for 1.75 but it was totally worth it.    I am so happy someone told me about this place!  I'm gonna order a whole pie next time :)"}
{"text":"Cugino's is the real deal.  Its like I was transported into Queens when I stepped in the place.  Hard to believe that such an awesome little Italian Deli & Market can exist a stone's throw from UNLV in a non-descript mini-mall.    The sandwiches could lay claim to the best in Las Vegas.  I'm not quite ready to make that claim 100% but give me a couple weeks and I might be able to.  The meats and cheeses are freshly sliced Boars Head products and the bread is crisp yet soft.  No I know a lot of you're are probably saying \"A lot of places use Boars Head, thats nothing special.\"  Well you're right in one regards but the mixture of ingredients, the freshness of the produce and care put in assembly make this sandwich truly magnificent.  Personally, Im a fan of the #2 Italian with capicolla.    Not a sandwich fan?  No problem, the pasta and pizza is just as good.  The pasta tastes as if some old Italian mama is in the back making it for her son and his mafioso pals.  Al dente and always the perfect blend of meat, cheese and sauce.  The pizza is phenomenal for Las Vegas.  In New York it would be above average, but with a dearth of good joints out here, this pizza is noteworthy.    I must make time to also acknowledge the garlic knots.  A great appetizer and just loaded with flavor and grease....a worthy combination, especially when I need a break from studying over at the UNLV library.    Cugino's also has a number of pastas, salamis, sauces and other Italian specialty products for sale besides their prepared foods.  There are a small number of tables if you wish to dine in, but service is at the counter.  I love the causal ethos of the place.  The staff is helpful and you get the feeling they are East Coast to the bone.    People are starting to discover Cugino's but it still amazes me that the Chipotle in front is always busy and people don't realize there is this gem 100 feet behind it."}
{"text":"So disappointed. I ordered a 10-inch margarita, which arrived cold. The mozzarella was melted into one big blob instead of those big, still fresh balls a true margarita has. The sauce tasted like unseasoned tomato paste out of a can. The crust was burnt. The pieces were sloppily cut with some huge and some slivers. Too be honest, it seemed like a pie you get out of a microwave at the airport. With the $5 delivery charge and tip, the barely edible pizza cost me $20 -- not worth it at all. They were also out of garlic knots. The only good thing I can say about them is the delivery lady was nice."}
{"text":"Ta DIE for!   Once found - we were daily visitors during our stay and managed to get a few others hooked on this place. I want to go back to Vegas just to eat here again. The chicken in the chicken salad was moist, fresh and SO flavorful and the \"house\" dressing was really special. Overall, our family sampled every type of offering available and no one was disappointed - everyone RAVED over their food."}
{"text":"The four of us really enjoyed our lunch at this outstanding little deli, and I'm looking forward to coming back soon. I had the Italian #2 cold sandwich featuring capacolla, Genoa salami, and beautiful fresh provolone cheese with fixin's on incredible deli-made bread. My son had the meatball sub, and we shared a Sicilian rice ball. One friend had a Sicilian rice ball served parmigiana style and the other ordered garlic bread with a side order of meatballs - a great combination, as it turned out. There's a nice assortment of imported foodstuffs for sale, too."}
{"text":"This place is fast becoming my favorite italian joint ever. It's rare that Las Vegas connects traditional italian, laid back deli, and 10/10 taste.   Here's a recommendation I sent to a  friend visiting from Chicago:   \"You're from chi town so I bet you have great Italian, but there is this hole in the wall place called Cugino's that has incredible Italian food. It's 4.5 stars and Yelp, and 5 stars on Trip Advisor. If you want a laid back Italian fix that won't break the bank, check it out!\"   I stand by my message. This place is great!"}
{"text":"A little over-rated IMO but definitely has its following from locals and UNLV students.  I had the Sicilian Tripe Soup which was rich in flavor but the taste of the tripe was more pungent.  I personally liked it but it can be more of an acquired taste for others.  I let 2 other people sample it and they said it tasted like ass.  To each their own.    The pastas were pretty decent.  We ordered the Penne ala Vodka with Shrimp.  The pasta was well cooked al dente but the shrimp were frozen and small.  For the price, there are other Italian Deli's like Roma, Rocco's Deli, and Rocco's Pizzeria that are much better.  The Rigatoni Bolognese I sampled from my friend was much better.  As for the pizza, I was not impressed.  I read many reviews that raved about it but it was greasy but I still downed it.  I prefer Rocco's Pizzeria and Rocco's Deli but this place is alright if you're on this side of town."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, I'd heard from my parents and friends to just drop in for a quick bite and I did just that. I am disappointed to say my experience didn't live up to my high expectations. I ordered a 2 pepperoni pizza slices and a cannoli and I watched them take the cheese pizza that had been sitting out, put pepperoni on it and put it back in the oven. I'm no pizza expert but I have never seen that done before, and it came out very dry and greasy. The saving grace is the authentic Italian deli atmosphere and thankfully the cannoli was right on par with with I expected out of an authentic Italian deli. I will certainly come back to try some different menu items, but the pizza I'm gonna steer clear from."}
{"text":"Wow. Their sandwiches are awesome.Their pizza is amazing too. $4.99 for 2 mega huge slices of cheese pizza and a drink. The slices were so big they packed it in a medium pizza box haha. I was SO full from the first slice.  It was just perfect everything."}
{"text":"This place is easy to overlook, but you'll want to go back after you try it.   If you're in the mood for something light, go with the chicken caesar salad. If you want something that's going to fill you up, order the sausage, green pepper, and onion sandwich, or their chicken parmigiana sandwich with garlic fries. They're both spectacular, and even better when paired with a garlic knot (or a full order of three).   Hands down this is the best family-owned and operated restaurant in walking distance from UNLV."}
{"text":"The best sandwiches, pizza, pasta and soup. Amazing food everything I tried is fresh from  scratch.  This family that's has amazing family secret recipes."}
{"text":"Also awesome homemade sausage including cheese and parsley sausage. they even make the cheese and parsley sausage with chicken instead of pork. Like going to a NY pork store WITH awesome pizza and food !!!"}
{"text":"By far the best New York style pizza place in Vegas.  I used to think it was Metro, but Cugino's is better and for half the price.  Also had the #1 and #2 sandwich which were both, again, the best I've had in Vegas."}
{"text":"Yum!  I am so excited to have found this place on Yelp.  I ordered the Cugino's Special sandwich and found the price reasonable and the ingredients to be very fresh and flavorful.  The staff were all very nice and you can tell the food is authentic.  I know where my favorite place to get lunch around campus is now!  I can't wait to go back and see what other treats they have to offer."}
{"text":"True Italian food, everything made fresh from scratch. Can't beat it. First time here and definitely not the last."}
{"text":"Recently new to Las Vegas from New York, I was dying for an authentic NY style deli. This is the exact place I'd been looking for! It is extremely authentic and reminds me so much of home. The Italian 1 & Italian 2 sandwiches are incredible, with the typical fixings of Capicola, provolone, salami. The sandwich is a good size for the price and the bread is to die for. I plan to come here often just so I can get a little piece of NY, with NY accents and all. Next time I definitely plan to go for the hot subs and even maybe a cannoli."}
{"text":"My neighbor ordered some takeout food from this place and shared a slice of pizza and a small portion of lasagna with me.I found each of them to be absolutely delicious.I can't wait  to actually go there and sample their offerings in person.As a former New Yorker of Italian American ancestry,I am always impressed by good quality Italian food.I don't find too much of it here in Las Vegas,but in all fairness I should mention that I don't go out of my way to look for it either.I am more partial to Chinese food and I rarely,if ever,find Italian food which I would put on a par with the great food that my mother from Italy cooked for me.She spoiled me greatly that way.Anyway,to make a long story short,I can't wait to visit this place.Highly recommended based on the small amount of their food that I ate and enjoyed so much."}
{"text":"First time visit based on Yelp review.  Absolutely awesome!!!  This is a small family owned Italian deli/restaurant with incredible food. We ordered the Cugino's Special Pizza.  Thin, crispy crust with very flavorful tomato sauce, nice chunks of sausage, onions and mushrooms (we omitted the green peppers).  My husband must have said \"this is really good pizza\" at least 5 times while eating.  Well, it WAS xcellent!  To top off dinner, we finished with Chocolate Italian Ice.  Yum!  The owner came by to see how we liked the pizza ... he was very friendly and chatted a few minutes.  Very warm and friendly environment.  If we lived in Vegas, Cugino's would be our #1 choice!"}
{"text":"Well, I found a new favorite for pizza. We had the Special pizza and a canolli. Best in Vegas so far."}
{"text":"Awesome!! I come here for the food not for the smiles. If you want a fake cheery smile don't come here.. You're gunna get true east coast feel and the food is reasonably price and delicious! The pizza is good.. I recommend the Donny Special.. you can thank me later"}
{"text":"Cugino's is my favorite Italian deli in town. Especially for the price. High quality food all around. I highly recommend the Cugino's Special (a sandwich made with prosciutto, fresh mozzarella, and marinated red bell peppers. And if you are still hungry, a rice ball or two."}
{"text":"When it comes to Las Vegas these days it is easy to find flaws...of course being the epitome of perfection as Rex is...it is easy.  Times have hit this city hard. The days of wine, roses and cheap gas for huffing are over. These are the tough times. The rough times. The decline of western civilization times. The times for poorly written and cliched observations.  Rex gets it. Times are tough for all of us. Rex can relate...a few nights ago he did the unthinkable...he ate at Panda Express.  Rex rarely feels shame but he does now. Rex knows that it is awful. Unthinkable. Rex will admit something else. A few days ago Rex huffed diesel insteal of premium unleaded.  Rex has hit bottom...Rex even considered going to the Circus Circus. Rex wept in shame.  Days went by...Rex could barely endure the horror. He ate at Roccos and plummeted further into a depression. None of the usual things made him feel better. Mocking Andre Agassi's hairline...no joy.  Circling cellulite in Star magazine...no joy. Licking the ground in front of Dairy Queen...no joy. Having sexual intercourse with himself...okay...that wasn't bad. Still...it wasn't the screaming ecstasy that Rex has come to expect.    Rex began to wonder...you know what will cheer Rex up...college coeds. Sexy college chicks. So he visited the strip clubs...and was rudely told that you must wear pants to enter. Rex doesn't wear pants for strip club. Rex called them fascists. Rex was beaten savagely by these pituitary cases...these rejects from the CFL.  Rex woke up in a dumpster near the college...his favorite way to awaken. He smelled good food. He walked. He hoped. He put on pants. He smelled again. He rubbed his eyes. He scratched his crotch vigorously. He wrote on a note pad to look for a used antibiotics bottle during one of his \"treasure\" hunts.  He went inside...he wept.  Cuginos. Cugino's Italian Deli. More beautiful words were never spoken...except the time I said \"please don't wake up Jessica Biel.\" (She didn't.)  Finding this gem in the desert was a shocking turn events for this depressed cow poke...(that was Rex's nickname...Rex \"Cow Poke\" Marvin...don't ask).  Rex was often told that there is NO INTELLIGENCE AT ALL to be found anywhere near UNLV.  After witnessing an after hours party, and scoring with an 18 year old chick who thought i was Brad Pitt's brother, Stu. Stu Pitt.  I thought they were right....but there are all only 99.9% correct.  The owner and operators of Cuginos are BRILLIANT! They are food genius's.    Great sandwiches. Check. Great ingredients. Check. Willing to serve a crying man with no pants. No check...the one strike against them.  Everything Rex has ever had there is brilliant.  Rex must recommend a few things...because that is what Rex does so perfectly.  Donnie's Special is a great sandwich. Chicken is perfectly cooked and seasoned. The fresh mozzarella is the best...more on that in the next paragraph. The Cuginos special is a great cold sandwich...if only slightly under seasoned.  The penne a la vodka is great.  Everything is great. if I had one complaint it would be that most dishes are so delicately seasoned they boarder on under seasoned.   Rex promised to save the best for last...much like Rex in bed. They make their own Mozzerella and it is the best in the city by far and away. New York curds made into pefect cheese...and extremely reasonably priced. Rex always buys some when he is there and chews on it like biting into bread. Just eats it raw.   Rex understands perfection. He lives it. Rarely can you describe anything in the food business as perfect, and not just for these crumbling times in Las Vegas...but for anywhere any time.   Every other deli in the city should look at Cuginos as the blueprint on how to succeed. Reasonably priced. Great food and uncompromising ingredients.   Rex is your perfect love. You are his perfect fool. Rex will be back to Cuginos. Rex will be back for you...and you will love him for it. Rex will leave...and you will love him more for it. Rex will love the cash he took from your purse."}
{"text":"In Las Vegas we don't have many actual Italian delis. We have Italian restaurants but no actually delis. This is my go to spot for everything italain.  It makes you feel like I'm back in Brooklyn getting a slice and the atmosphere makes you feel back home. The family that owns it are funny real nice guys. The father wife and sons run it. You can buy calimari, rice balls, macaroni salad. They have Italian ices and the best canolis hands down. If you want a real authentic Italian deli feel or just great italian food, then I promise you this is the spot!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"the absolute best italian deli in  nevada.   i lived in new york all my life..   these guys used to live in new york also...   they do things the old school way.....  they brought new york here with them when they opened up this treasure.    this is true italian food..  not make believe..  anything you eat in this place is 100% authentic italian..  i would highly recommend to anyone that loves great italian food....you won't be disappointed.....mangia....."}
{"text":"Fresh Basil and Tomato Pizza from Cugino's should have a star on the Pizza Walk of Fame. 5 Star pie all the way.   The shopping center it's hiding in holds years of memories to me. I use to chain smoke Cloves at Cafe Copio when I was in my teens and consume large quantities of cheap beer listening to the Beastie Boys at Tom n Jerry's when I was barely 21. The days when I had less bills and belly fat. My Doc Martens and I ruled the world. Great memories were had here. This made picking up this pizza that much better. On to the pizza.  When I walked into Cugino's for the first time I was overwhelmed with all of the authentic cheeses, meats, breads, pastas. This was the moment I realized I am not just a foodie, but a gigantic food pervert. This is Food Pervert Heaven!!! Just walk in and you will know what I mean.  Fresh Tomato and Basil Pizza- Large for $16.99. Do not make any changes to it. Everything about this dime piece is bangin just the way she is. If you don't like garlic than this isn't the Za for you and we are not friends. I happen to LOVE garlic and this sexy pie is packed with it. Then they throw fresh, earthy basil and firm tommies to the mix and walla. The perfect pie. Don't even get me started on the crust. Let's just say every great painting starts with a fine canvas. I love this pizza.  It's simple and simply phenomenal and everyone I shared it with agreed.   When I was driving home with the pie I felt like I had the hottest date in my car. Seriously, the aroma gently traveling from that box to my nostrils made me high and I couldn't stop smiling from ear to ear.  I can't wait to do this dance again only next time I will be rockin out to Violent Femmes remembering the good ole days in my hometown.  Kudos to Yelp (Rex's review) for leading me to Cugino's. Nacho C. and his birds would have loved this food. Mad props to Cugino's for making an incredible pie. All the other pie shops can sleep with the fishes."}
{"text":"Second best deli in town for me. The pastrami on rye is gigantic!! Must be at least a pound of meat in there!! You can't go wrong with any sandwich here, but I always get the pastrami. Can't be beat. The garlic knots are garlicky, buttery, soft pillows of dough. Melt in your mouth. Really like this place. It's a close second to Carnegie deli."}
{"text":"Bomb sandwiches.  I got the Italian#2 on the way up to Zion and then three days later got the rueben on the way home from Zion (and another #2 for my wife). It was the only good I thought about while in Zion.  Best food in Vegas by far!"}
{"text":"Tried so many item from here pizza with olives and sausage, mild wings, garlic knots, and canoli, all was delicious. Will be back again."}
{"text":"Sweet Mother of homemade Mozzarella, this place is the bomb! Last night of working in Vegas and my buddy wants Italian. For whatever reason, a little voice in my head whispers \"Cugino's\". Now, I've never heard nor seen this place, so I found it pretty serendipitous that it was first on the list when I looked up Italian joints. Intuition, I thank you. Although small and unassuming, this humble joint served me some of the best lasagna I've had in years. Simple, yet elegant. Messy, yet comforting. Their espresso was genuine, as were the owners who served us. We were treated to samples of their homemade cheeses and conversations of home, fighting, and naps. It was a refreshing lil slice of New York charm and know how hidden in this bustling desert. If you claim to love traditional Italian cuisine and you pass up the chance to come by this jewel, shame on you. Finally, in the land of glitz and glam, augmented attitudes and body parts, I've found a place I can feel at home."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem.  Great food and great family-owned atmosphere.  I had the spaghetti and meatballs and it was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Amazing Italian food! I moved out here from Connecticut about 9 months ago and I've been searching for great Italian food that reminds me of home...this place is the real deal! I'll be back again and again!  P.S. I had the Donnie Special sandwich...fantastic!"}
{"text":"Great example of a good Italian deli!  I ordered the rigatoni with bolognese sauce... I could only get through half of it!  The service was great and made me think of old school Italians!  Two thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times since the first time I tried it. Originally I was looking for deli meats and olives and found their business card on a closed deli's door that I had frequented often. It was close by so I went. I have been back OVER AND OVER since.   PROS:  *Marinated Olives *Deli Meats *Easter Pie (made for special holidays; its a thick pie of pizza doe mixed with cheese, eggs and italian deli meats. Serve warm. *Stromboli - thin dough rolled with various Italian meats and cheese. Sliced and served warm. *Eggplant Parmasen- Large portion of thinly sliced lighted breaded eggplant and mozzarella cheese covered in their amazing homemade sauce. Served with a salad and pasta. Bigger than a restaurant portion. *The Godfather Sandwich - Fried Eggplant, Mozzarella, Roasted Pepper and balsamic vinegar. *Donnie's Special Sandwich - Chicken Cutlets (thin), fresh mozzarella, roasted pepper, balsamic vinegar and oil. *HOMEMADE on premises mozzarella cheese. The best I have had in Las Vegas. Firm and lightly salted. EXCELLENT."}
{"text":"Very yummy food! So cute too, a little mom and pop store with I am assuming mainly repeat customers.   I ordered the gnocci and I am a huge fan so I was a big critic and I would say I am a fan, next time I do plan to order the pizza next time.  The service could use some work but granted I was a college student with a group so maybe they didn't think too much of me?   Either way yummy food that was decently priced"}
{"text":"I'd give them 10 stars if  I could!! Donnie you're the man...  some of the best people in the valley run this place. Best deli hands down in Las Vegas. Best pizza, best sandwiches and best homemade sausage. Best homemade mozzarella too. Do yourself a favor and go eat here. Thank you to the Cugino family for being as great as you are and making me fatter through the years!!"}
{"text":"I'm completely in love with their Spaghetti and Meatballs! I highly recommend them, especially since it's not a bad price for the proportions they give you."}
{"text":"Solid all around. Might be one of the closest places you'll go to get an authentic NY slice of pizza. For $6 you can get 2 pieces of pizza and a drink. That's a solid deal for Vegas. The pizza selection isn't great, where they only make cheese, but you can add toppings for like 40 cents. The meatball sandwich and the chicken park looked good as well.   I'll be back to have a few slices in the future. It's not the best piece of pizza ever (props to you NY) but it's pretty close substitute for the area."}
{"text":"I love Cugino's but they did disappoint me the last two times that I was there with guests. The clam linguini was too dry and had no flavor and the pizza was average. They were missing that Cugino's touch! I'll give it a try once more and see..."}
{"text":"Great food! Pizza is on point and pasta is deliciouso. I will be back on my next trip to the strip."}
{"text":"Place is not good. I am from Staten Island and the food tastes Mediocre at best. Plus they're a super ripoff. I got a chicken cutlet hero with fresh mozz and roasted peppers, a snapple and a bag of chips and it was $17. Who charges $14 for a hero?! I guess you can when LV has no good italian pork stores including this one."}
{"text":"Food was okay, but not spectacular.  I have been spoiled by very good Italian food.  Especially the Italian sandwiches.  These sandwiches were okay, but a bit blander than I am used to.  The pizza was also bland.  If you are looking for this type of items, go out of your way to Spaghetty Western off southern highlands parkway in Las Vegas.  They have an incredible Italian sandwich and make their own pasta."}
{"text":"I kinda envy the students at UNLV.  It's not because their school is typically rated in the top 50 for hottest studies bodies, or the fact the Strip is so accessible to them, but it's because they can go to places like Cugino's whenever they want!  This is that Italian deli, or any deli really, that you wish was right by your school or work.  It's about 2 miles from the Strip, so you can either take a brief drive down E. Tropicana Ave and turn down Maryland, or walk that way for about 40 minutes. It's obviously more authentic than options on the Strip, and better yet, at cheaper prices.  Once you enter it, you can tell it's locally-owned, as is has that mom and pop shop type look and feel. Check out some of the photos others posted, as you'll see it's not just a counter to order food at and chairs to sit on.  They have lots of foods on display packaged up that you can order or grab, like meats, salads, and breads.  I was afraid to look too closely as I would have spent way more than I planned.  For $9.99, I went with the basic spaghetti and meatballs with included 2 breadsticks and a sizable salad.   If you're visiting Vegas and have your own car, consider heading over here. If you're a student at UNLV and have a break during lunch, just walk on over here. Over, and over."}
{"text":"Love their spaghetti & meat balls ! Their four cheese raviole is also good. I also tried their Philly cheesesteak. All good!"}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!!  As a NY Italian I have been trying to find authentic Italian food (I'm not talking Olive Garden people, I mean REAL Italian food) ever since I moved to Vegas almost 12 years ago and I found it at Cugino's.  I have never had anything off the menu that I didn't like but my two favorites are their Pene A la Vodka and the Goodfella (roasted veggies with roasted red peppers, homemade mozz on a toasted roll with a little olive oil and balsamic) sandwich.  Oh and their pizza is the bomb too!  Everything they make is homemade... the sauce, the cheese (ricotta and mozz), the meatballs, the soup, the sausage, the.. well you get the picture and it makes such a difference in the taste of the food.  The prices are great and the people are friendly.  If you decide to go for lunch during the week when UNLV is in session, get there early because its not uncommon to see a line to the door."}
{"text":"Great food and very reasonable prices. These same plates fancied up at a strip hotel would have cost me another $10/plate - easily!   My husband was craving a great pastrami and they definitely satisfied his craving!  My only disappointment was I came about 40min after they had opened and the garlic knots I wanted wouldn't be available for another 30min...unfortunate."}
{"text":"I just love this place! Super friendly staff. & Super yummy food. The garlic knots are to die for. Pizza is excellent. Wide menu range. I've been happy with every order I've received, dine in, carry out or delivery. (:"}
{"text":"The BEST Italian Sub in the West and for sure the best in Vegas. The wedding soup is also top notch. The whole place is like stepping into a machine that takes you to NYC when you step in the door.  I don't care for the rice balls.They tasted a little bit rancid. But everything else is top notch stuff. This is real Italian deli food!"}
{"text":"We really liked the pizza and the garlic knots were delicious. Perfect, laid back New York deli style."}
{"text":"Every review has been on the restaurant but i am going to review on the groceries.  I went in today for marscapone, ricotta, sausage, mozzarella, and parmeasan.  The gentleman that helped ke was super awesome and my cheeses and sausages were amazing and made my recipes even better!  Will definitely be foing there a lot more often.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Clearly a solid hole in the wall establishment! Great service, food was delish. Highly suggest the rice balls and pasta w/ fresh tomatoes and basil."}
{"text":"The best Pizza place ever. I thought Pizza Hut was good, but nothing compares to Cuginos. Employees are the best. They treated us like family. Best pizza in the world that I've tasted!!"}
{"text":"Authentic Italian food! Best meal my husband and I had in Vegas. I had the  lasagna and it came with a side salad and two pieces of bread. My husband had the Italian sausage. We both enjoyed our food but the lasagna had the most flavor from the two. We also tried the garlic knots and they were delicious. This is place will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Cugino's is a really nice Italian Deli and Pizzaria that is nestled in a cozy spot across from UNLV. The staff is very nice and will recommend specials of the day if you have never been before. I've gotten the Spaghetti and meatballs and pizza twice now, and let me tell you the portions DEFINITELY fill you up!"}
{"text":"Another bookmark bites the dust! I actually bookmarked this place a long time ago after seeing someone post a picture of a yummy looking pastrami sandwich, which I knew my husband would love trying. When we walked in and I saw they had pizza and other stuff on the menu I was excited to give this place a try. They had the typical \"pizza by the slice\" sitting out on the counter as well the same thing with the garlic knots. I don't mind when pizza is sitting there and gets re-heated, if it is good pizza it can handle it. What I don't like is when it has actually been sitting there for hours. With this place being located across the street from UNLV, I would figure if good pizza is put out here, it wouldn't last long with a college crowd around. I love trying garlic knots from different places, but just couldn't do it here since they looked greasy and like they had been sitting there for a long time. Bummer.  I just asked for a regular slice of cheese ($2.25 each) and a Sicilian slice ($2.50 each) to-go. The regular cheese slice was almost not edible. The slice had too much cheese on it weighing it down and when I picked up the slice it immediately flopped. No folding with that slice! It just lacked any \"wow\" flavor for me. The Sicilian slice however was perfect. The crust was crisp and chewy where it needed to be and I enjoyed every bite. I'm really glad I tried both because just trying the regular slice wouldn't have me wanting to come back. I don't usually see places that sell Sicilian by the slice so that is a bonus plus the fact that it tastes legit.   They have Boar's Head lunch meat for sale and a variety of sides. Inside appeared clean and there are tables or booths inside and tables outside. Catering is offered. Delivery is offered."}
{"text":"Very nice! Cugino's is one of the few true Italian delis in town, and they have a good assortment of what people from back East are used finding.  Yes, there are plenty of popular favorites that we all know: pizza, meatball subs, chicken parmigiana, etc., and there are also some traditional Italian foods you might not be familiar with.  I have an \"old world\" Italian heritage thanks to my mom. Every St. Joseph's day, she made arancini, and every Easter she made a pizzagiana. When I first found Cugino's I was floored! Arancini readily available! Mortadella in the deli case! Checkerboard cookies by the dozen! Frozen sfogliatelli to take home and bake!  If you've been looking for food like Nonna used to make, or you're feeling a little adventurous, or you just want some good pizza by the slice, head to the University district and give Cugino's a try."}
{"text":"Another Yelp find thanks to fellow Yelpers.  We decided against any buffets while in Vegas because we know there are good eats out there and we did find them.  We tried the Sicilian tripe soup. Didn't know Italians like tripe but I guess they do. Think of this soup as minestrone with pieces of tripe that are easy to chew because sometimes it could seem like you are chewing on rubber.  I recommend going for the hot sandwiches instead of the  cold ones since they seem to have more flavor."}
{"text":"In Vegas for a show and always use Yelp to find different places. I type in New York Deli and Cugino's comes up.  Check them out online and I was on my way. When I walked in the aroma WOW!  Walk up to the counter and I see  Sicilian Pizza, Rice Balls, Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Ice, Sfogliatelli from Italy, Cannolis... I was in my glory. Great prices and family run business. If you live in Vegas you must give this place a try."}
{"text":"Expensive and not that good. Friend got a eggplant parm and I got a sausage parm, neither that satisfying nor were the portions that great for $9. Girlfriend got a bolognese and came out extremely oily asked to get something else without even touching the pasta and they refuse and finally exchange it was 2 slices of plain cheese pizza which wasn't spectacular either. $13 for $4 worth of pizza. Beware of this place, I don't understand the other review here, doesn't add up to me. I could go to subway and get a better meatball sub then this place or go to metro pizza down the block and get better tasting pizza!"}
{"text":"Ordered the meatball sandwhich and this was delish!  I also ordered a slice of cheese pizza.  This pizza was also good.  The establishment is clean.  I went for lunch break and the establishment was packed but yet I got my food pretty quickly.  I will be back for more!"}
{"text":"I have been looking for a place like this on the East side of town for quite some time. Thanks to Yelp i have found this little gem hidden away by UNLV. I ordered the Special with Prosciutto, roasted red peppers, mozzarella and balsamic. I also wanted to build my own with mortadella, prosciutto and mozzarella. I mave have confused the guy but i got all this on one..WOW what a snadwhich!! My wife and i split it and it was so filling. The hard roll really made the sandwhich. I also tried the bruscetta. It was on a pizza dough and was ok. I like my bruschetta on a crust piece of bread. I will definately be back soon. There were Italian favorites all over the store hot, cold and frozen. The staff was also very friendly."}
{"text":"Originally, our plan was to hit up The Lunchbox, but at the time, we did not know he was closed on the weekends!  No worries, Plan B was Cugino's Deli  in the strip mall next door. We shared an Arancini, some Garlic Knots, The Sicilian Pizza Special, and whats probably the tastiest Meatball Parm I've had in a very long while!  Looking forward to returning to try other Italian specialities....ALOHA!!!"}
{"text":"When I was in the area today, I remembered reading the favorable reviews for Cugino's. It is a cute Italian deli with self order counter, large selection of bottled beverages, grocery items and deli meats/cheeses. I eagerly ordered the Eggplant Parm Sandwich and oh, so disappointed! I was expecting so much more from the great reviews.  First of all, I believe the joy in eating eggplant parm is that creamy texture of the eggplant and the crispy fried breading.  Both fell short.  The eggplant was sliced so thin that there was no texture expect for the stringy skin and the the breading soggy like it had been fried and left sitting.  Come on now, the pictures for the deli sandwiches were nice and meaty. Eggplant is a lot cheaper than deli meat!  For $8 I was expecting a better looking and tasting sandwich, I left there hungry!  The sandwich had 3 limpy strips of eggplant with some marinara only on the top with cheese served with two pepperoncini's on the side. I also thought it was odd that the eggplant was cut into long strips?  Why not preserve the natural oval shape of the eggplant and be generous with your eggplant, let it hang out of  the bread a little.  At least your customers would perceive it to be a better value by their first impression.   By the looks of the reviews and what was coming out of the kitchen, pizza must be there top seller. I will never know.  This isn't a place I'd drive from Summerlin to try again."}
{"text":"Love love! Pizza one of the best!  Garlic knots is simply the best - all gone before I get home. Service is great - very helpful,  layed back n always happy.  Covered outside seating.  The deli products look amazing - must be folks in front of order meats / cheese. ."}
{"text":"With no little Italy in Vegas we were happy to find this place. Everyone was friendly and helpful. The pizza was awesome fresh sliced toppings as you watch. Hand breaded mozzarella sticks. I can't compliment it enough. I loved it. Even the cheese is grated fresh. I will return again."}
{"text":"This was our second time visiting Cugino's and it was just as great as first visit.  The sandwiches were delicious.  The chicken cutlet sandwich was tender and moist.  The homemade bread was made just perfect.  We especially liked the Easter Pie which is a seasonal offering.  It reminded my husband of his Italian aunts who used to make it every Easter.  The owners /staff were very hospitable and gracious.  We will come back again on our next visit to Vegas."}
{"text":"I have been going here for a few months now and have tried every specialty sandwich they make.  After enjoying this place for awhile, I felt it was time to write a review.  This is a small family run deli and from what I know from talking with the folks that run it, they are making just about everything from scratch. As I mentioned, I have had every specialty sandwich and while I like most very much, the Donnie Special might be my favorite (by a small margin).  I would also recommend anything they serve with their marinara sauce, it is delicious and has a fresh bright taste.  The mozzarella cheese is made in house and better than any high end mozzarella that I have every bought or tasted.  I love coming here for lunch and of course no meal is every complete without a delicious, filled to order canoli."}
{"text":"Amazing sooooo yummy come here if u love food try it u will love the meatballs sandwich"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. Caprese salad, garlic bread, spaghetti and meatballs, salad, and veal parmigiana were all authentic and homemade in flavor. Nothing was too rich or greasy in flavor. It may look like a simple, plain eatery, but it has a very warm feel to it and you can also eat outside. We ordered so much we had leftovers, but that was the least of our worries because I looked forward to eating those delicious leftovers later.  I like to eat on the Strip for convenience but don't be afraid to venture out a little bit to this place. The espresso was excellent, I must recommend!"}
{"text":"Get two slices of pizza and a drink for $5.99 or just the pizza for $4.99. It's an easy walk from UNLV. The garlic knots are greasy and aromatic. Some of my friends eat pizza AND knots AND the mini box of assorted cookies for lunch."}
{"text":"Viva Italia! Fantastic and Authentic. Pastas, Pizzas, Salads, Subs and much, much more. They offer deli meats, desserts, and a variety of other shopping items to make great cuisine at home.  I am a local to LV and travel from Summerlin often to eat and shop here. Absolutely worth it!"}
{"text":"Having been raised on the best Italian sub sandwiches and pizzas in the New York/New Jersey/Philadelphia area, I have been on a quest for the same quality and flavor on the West Coast for years.  That search is now over.  Not much to say other than its real, tasty and genuine. The family is so nice - Nando specifically.  Do yourself a favor- you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Just Go!  The food is good, Italian cookies are wonderful. Crunchy hot sandwiches make your mouth water.  Great place."}
{"text":"THE BEST ITALIAN EATERY IN VEGAS! (and it's affordable too!!!)  This mom n pop shop makes in on our must go places when we're in town.   -Linguini with clams in red sauce!!!! -Garlic knots!!! -Even their Coke tastes better!!! Lol"}
{"text":"Rainy day in LAS so decided I needed some down home Italian food items. Thanks yelp for directing me here! Ah - ma - zing! Went for late lunch and asked the guy at the register what I should have - he said chicken parm entree (w/ salad & pasta) & I was not disappointed! Chicken was tender and delish - and sauce (home made) was so tasty. Can't wait to go back and try some of their home made sausages & cheese. Also, peeps who work there are super nice and friendly - always a major plus!"}
{"text":"outstanding place, authentic highly recommend the Rubin sandwich!!!!!"}
{"text":"so it's a deli, dinner and a mom and pop shop feel. we go here for authentic ny style pizza. we normally order rice balls (the small ones, they don't have meat or peas like the big ones) and a large cheese and we add red peppers and garlic."}
{"text":"Love the caprese sandwich, calzone, and pizza!"}
{"text":"We were on a family vacation and wanted to get off the strip. Thank god we found Cugino's. Best food in Vegas hands down. We have made sure every trip back we eat here at least twice. Food is amazing!!!! Wish they would deliver to Ventura, Ca. Everything on the menu is to die for."}
{"text":"2/23/2016  I stopped in and had a Ruben sandwich and my sister had a Turkey sandwich and both were delicious.  Service was friendly and food came out within a reasonable time.  I would return and try other dishes as this is what I think of when Italian Deli comes to mind."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best and most enjoyable lunch we had during our 5 day stay in Vegas.  Hubby had a mortadella and swiss sandwich and I had the pastrami melt.  If you're Italian (we are) or have ever been to a genuine Italian deli, you will love this place.  Ah, the aromas.  Delicious quality food.  Friendly service. So glad that we left The Strip to try Cugino's."}
{"text":"Very nice small family operated Deli. Great tasting food. The staff were all friendly and helpful. We really enjoyed our food. Had Calzones and Spaghetti the first visit and Sandwiches the second time. The homemade tiramisu was amazing.  Definitely a great place and a must try when in Vegas. We will always come back when in the city."}
{"text":"Food is excellent! Must get balls...Rice balls I meant!  Placed a lunch order online, it was so easy with just a few clicks. The delivery charge was only $5 additional, very reasonable considering gas prices are so high, this is a steal!   The delivery lady was 3 min early and the food was very fresh still. Ordered the Godfather sandwich $10, side salad $4, Rice ball $2.50, Cannoli and the Cugino Sampler. The sandwich was huge - loaded with lots of meat, and very tasty. My favorite has to be the rice ball, can't fault a girl for loving balls! The Cugino sampler contains 2-3 of the mozzarella sticks, chicken wings, and fried zucchini. The salad was meh, just some veggies with pre-packaged salad dressing.   Probably will try their pizza next time."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's very 'mom and pop', the same family has been running this place for years. Has the requisite deli market inside, get your canned tomatoes, pastas, etc to go. But don't come here for that, come here for the food and ambiance. Check out there daily specials, always a good deal, always good and you get a large portion here. I can speak for their chicken fingers, nice large planks, cooked crispy and sauce on the side. Their Italian sub is fantastic, layered nicely with the typical Italian meats and cheeses. The reuben sandwich is also great, piled high with corned beef. Making myself hungry just writing about it!"}
{"text":"Like always this place does not disappoint, food is great doesn't take too long to get your food either, I always eat here when ever I want some Italian food"}
{"text":"Very authentic New York Italian.  The Cheese pizza is perfectly New York Style.  Appetizer combo was good.  Tiramisu and Canneloni was great.    Comfortable environment .  It's also a store and sandwich deli.   Definitely worth trying"}
{"text":"Came here because the tiramisu and cannolis were rated so high, and was not disappointed. easily the best in town. loved the charm of the old style italian deli."}
{"text":"Cugino's has become 'must visit' for me whenever I go to Vegas. Their Chicken Parm sandwich is as good as I've had anywhere, and as an added bonus they have Italian water ice! The service is friendly and fast. For such a huge menu, everything I've ever ordered there has been amazing."}
{"text":"Authentic Italian deli in the UNLV area. What to expect!- good food served with a slight attitude at a so so price.  Had the spaghetti and meat balls which were very tasty but only 2 small meatballs for 9.99 at a hole in the wall in the hood? That was surprising. Would still recommend for a long lunch but not a date atmosphere"}
{"text":"We were hungry for Italian, it was amazing.  The rigatoni bolognese was fabulous.  The meat balls were firm and not spicy and the Gallic knots were the best. We hope you try them and have a great meal."}
{"text":"Not 5 star pizza, but over and above 5 stars for service. My friend was in town and we were going back to her hotel room for pizza and wine (and if you must know, Britney Spears on the X-factor). We had stopped earlier for wine, but like doofuses we did not think about getting the wine open. They let us use their corkscrew to open up our wine and we returned it and went on our merry way. They could have told us to screw off, but instead they let us borrow it and were nice about it, too.  As for the pizza, I was not as impressed as I expected to be. It was flavorful and the toppings were fresh, but the crust didn't have the crusty-qualities that I look for in a pizza. However, I would be willing to try it again because it is a straight-up deli with olives, pasta salad, sandwiches, various other deliciousness. Plus they were just such nice people that I want to patronize their establishment again!"}
{"text":"Wow!! My wife and I had a pedicure next door after flying in. I was starving and came in intending to get some pizza. Instead, I had a sandwich. First, it's like walking into an Italian neighborhood family restaurant. Second, the food is great!! I loved to watch some older Italian guys come in and greet the employees. I highly recommend to stop by!!"}
{"text":"So I ordered garlic knots and the Sicilian two slice special. Unfortunately the garlic knots were hard as a rock and the pizza was hard as if it was sitting out all day then just thrown in the oven to get it hot. I've seen the other reviews and maybe next time I can get the pizza right out of the oven to do a proper review on the taste."}
{"text":"My lunch appointment was canceled today, so I decided to head to Cugino's and try their Pizza and Cappicolo/Salami/Provolone Italian Sandwich (#2 on the menu).  Their Pizza is a traditional NY Thin Crust Pizza (see pics).....very good!  Easy to fold...(like it's suppose to be)....Fuggetta-bout-it!  I had a slice of Cheese Pizza to get the lunch started while I waited for my sandwich.  The sandwich came out and was the perfect portion, not too large, not too small.  They use Boar's Head deli meat, which is one of my favorites.  The bread is good and there's just the right amount of oil/vinegar...not too overwhelming like some other sandwich joints.  What a great lunch.  Will I return?  What's the mattah you!....of course!"}
{"text":"Fast delivery. Very delicious pizza and wings. Also tried the Gino's special sandwich sooo Good"}
{"text":"Wow, a huge disappointment based on the other reviews I read. Maybe it's good if you go to their restaurant, but our delivery was terrible, first they must not read the \"special instructions\" section on the order page. Since they completely ignored the delivery instructions our order arrived, delivered by \"Rose\" completely cold, and basically thrown at us with complete discussed on her part. The pizza was worse than Dominos, but to be fair the Greek salad was very good. I don't like to post negative comments but know it's important for both others as well as management if they want to improve."}
{"text":"Just walked in asked for two slices of cheese. Just one dried up pieces. He said they did not have any made. Idiot let me walk out without offering anything else. Guess they don't need the business..."}
{"text":"I love Cuginos. Discovered it on accident while a friend was eating at Chipotle and wanted a slice of pizza. I bought two slices intending to bring a piece to my fiancé when he got out of class at UNLV... oops. I ended up eating both, because they were SO good!  Fast forward a few years and we pick up pizza there whenever we are nearby. We live across the city and we don't get to eat there very often, but every once in a while I'll mention Cugino's to a friend and I have yet to talk to someone about it who doesn't know the place and love it!  The pizza is great, the garlic knots and deep fried gnocchi are also good. I haven't tried anything else on the menu because I literally cannot get out of there without a slice of pizza."}
{"text":"I don't feel qualified to write an in depth review, I only ordered a Sicilian Rice ball. However, if the rest of the food is anything close, I'm impressed. The rice ball was filled with meat, cheese, rice, and then breaded/fried. It came with a cup of sauce on the side. The sauce was absolutely wonderful. Just the right amount of sweetness and garlic. The price was okay, and the customer service lacked just a bit. You can tell this is a family run restaurant and that they don't mess around about their food. Overall, I will definitely come here again and try other items. The inside reminds me of a Bodega in NYC where you can find good Italian made pizza. There are shelves with Italian products and treats and some tables and chairs inside if you'd like to eat there."}
{"text":"Great little place.... landed in Vegas and wanted to find a deli of some sort so we checked yelp, of coarse. So glad I did!! Found this place and stopped in for a  quick lunch, got Pizza, Meatball Sandwich, and fried Zucchini. It was so good that I forgot to take a picture of the food :) .. Would go back while in Vegas."}
{"text":"Wow, another winning restaurant in Vegas, and as usual, it's not even on the Strip.  Seriously, the next time I return, I'm not even going to BOTHER with the Strip at all, because all the good stuff is on the outskirts.  Cugino's is such a place.    This is sort of a combination restaurant/pizza shop/Italian goods store - it reminds me a LOT of Trinacria at home (which most Baltimoreans adore).  There's a deli where you can get specialty meats and cheeses, pastas, and other goodness.  My husband and I came here to eat, though, and eat we did!  My husband got the Donnie sandwich, while I tried a pastrami melt.  Let me tell you, folks, that Donnie is something ELSE, okay?  The mozzarella, meat and vinegar combined into one huge taste explosion that I will quite probably remember for the rest of my days.  It was THAT good.  And the pastrami melt.... wow.  Huge, juicy, delicious.  I have never had any sandwich in my life that I liked more.    We ordered two cannolis for dessert and they went down perfectly with the meal.  Really, really good stuff.  Definitely rivals Trinacria here, my Baltimore friends, so you have GOT to come over to this place to eat when you visit Vegas.  If we lived here, this would be our go-to shop for Italian staples.  We didn't try the pizza, but we overheard our neighbors-in-food raving about it - something about how they haven't had decent New York pizza since they left New York but they finally found it here.    So now you KNOW it's good.  This is definitely worth a revisit when we come back to the area.  Don't miss this place.  The Yelp reviews are on target here."}
{"text":"This deli was so great that we went back the next day. We started out wanting sandwiches but when we saw the rest of the menu we couldn't pass up all of the pastas.  Ended up with meat raviolis, lobster raviolis, lasagna and tortellini with vodka sauce. All were great but the lobster ravioli were incredible. Thanks for the great food. We will return."}
{"text":"We did enjoy the pizzas. The meatball was excellent and offered a wonderful addition to the cheese"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza for delivery and it got here much faster than I thought it would.  The pizza was hot, huge for two,  and was amazing.  I'll definitely order again for a game night."}
{"text":"Place was ok.  Tried the porchetta and broccoli rabe sub.  Meh.  Bought some cannoli to take home.  Meh.   Market looked tempting and will definitely go back to check it out"}
{"text":"Food: sandwiches are about $9 each and took about 15 minutes to come out.  We ordered the meatball parm sandwich and chicken parm sandwich which were very good quality sandwiches.   Meatball one was super moist and the bread had the right amount of crunch.  The sauce didn't make the bread soggy which was to my surprise.   The chicken was Katsu style which I did not find to go well inside a sandwich. The Katsu got pretty soggy after being inside the sandwich so I had to remove it as I was eating.    They do have some free samples on the cashier counter for small chips and what not."}
{"text":"Im really a big fan of Italian delis. This places is a really good find here in Las Vegas its across from the university and not far from the strip. The place is clean has a good amount of seating and the food is good. The people that run this deli where friendly and service was good. Here's what I ordered was the Italian sausage sandwich and the garlic knots, the garlic knots where really good and the sandwich was good as well. Like any other Italian deli they raviolis ,pizza ,cheese ,Italian sausages ,salami ,cheese and much more. This place also has Italian ice cream. I would order any of their sandwich here off their menu they all looked good. I will be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"To be honest, I've been here countless times and the only thing I ever had was their meat ball spaghetti. It is just the best spaghetti I've ever had. I have had meatball spaghetti in so many places and Cugino's is just so delicious that I am already addicted to it like crazyyyyy. The entree comes with a dish of fresh Salad and two italian bread sticks. The salad is always fresh and tasty and the bread is just unbelievably good.    Not gonna lie that I am not a picky person and I always give 5 stars review everywhere I go, but 100 some people give this place a 4 or 5 stars. You just can't go wrong with CUGINO!  CUGINO CUGINO CUGINO.  MEATBALL SPAGHETTI  MEATBALL SPAGHETTI MEATBALL SPAGHETTI"}
{"text":"I met two friends here yesterday for lunch.  We wanted to try several things but some of the normal crew couldn't make it.  After a bit of confusion on our part about what to order and the idea of mixing sauces on one pizza-spearate for each half, we got our order in and then had a seat.  This is a no frills, small spot.  My one photo basically shows all the seating except for some not seen on the right.  You get your own plastic ware and napkins from a table to the left of the deli case and there are salt and pepper shakers there and some hot peppers and other spices you might want with Italian food.  We first got fried gnocchi which were OK.  The marinara dipping sauce was good.  Two of us shared a fried rice ball with some tomato sauce and lots of cheese.  It was good.  Next, we had two pizzas.  Yes, three people eating two pizzas.  We got a thin style white pizza and a Sicilian style Margherita pizza.  Needless to say, one of left Cugino's with some leftovers--me.  Andrea enjoyed the pizza tonight.  The pizzas were both good.  I'm spoiled by a white truffle pizza I'm used to getting so this white pizza was a little lacking.  The Margherita was good with a rich sauce and lots of melted cheese.  We also had an order of garlic knots with their good marinara dipping sauce.  For me, this was the star of lunch.  They had good garlic flavor that wasn't lost when dipped in the marinara.  For dessert, we each had a cannoli.  Thank you M.  This is a great lunch place for students because it's right across the street from UNLV's student center.    I think I'll stop in and try some of their deli salads.  That would be my reason for returning.  The rest was good but pretty standard Italian fare."}
{"text":"This place holds up to the reviews, except it deserves 5+ stars. The pizza is delicious! And the ranch dressing needs to be sold by the gallon. The pasta is so, so good. We ate everything we ordered and still wanted more! We will be back EVERY time we come to town!!"}
{"text":"This is now our favorite Italian deli. The food is spot on. I had the meatball parm sandwich, and my wife had the Rigatoni Bolognese. The sauce for her meal was honestly incredible! We also had garlic knots. All the food was delicious. If you come at lunch, there may be a bit of a line because this place is so popular with locals--always a good sign. The owners and servers are East coast Italian, which adds to the experience. Know what you want to order before you get to the counter or you may get a little New York attitude."}
{"text":"The first time I had eggplant on pizza was outside the Vatican in Rome and this is just as delicious. Cugino's is my go to lunch when I'm having a bad day at the office or just feel like delicious pizza and the smell of garlic knots lifts my spirits every time!!"}
{"text":"Came here with my wife on a rainy afternoon. Been craving Italian food for a while, and the last place we tried that was similar was Rocco's. That establishment was outstanding so I was kind of using it as a benchmark.  Cugino's is located in a strip mall near UNLV. It was totally packed inside. Everyone was wedged in their like sardines. But it was lunch, so it was to be expected. The line moved quickly and the service was fast and friendly enough.  I first noticed the pizza they had sitting out looked old and pretty dry. A little disappointing to say the least, especially since pizza is what my wife originally wanted. We opted for the meatball parmigiana sub and a riceball.  The riceball was good, but nothing special. The meatball sub was pretty good. The meatballs were flavorful, and the marinara sauce was decent.  The bread was toasted and fresh. If there was any cheese it was very little. I guess this was the disappointment. The sandwich was tiny!!!. Not at all like i'm used to getting at an Italian Deli. Most deli's your so stuffed when your done, you roll out like a beach ball. No such luck here.  Overall I'd give this Deli 2.5 stars. Service is friendly. Food is good, but i've had way better, portions are small, and the dining area is small and crowded. Much better options in Vegas."}
{"text":"Hidden Gem is right! The red sauce is really good, fresh.  We had the sausage sub. They make their own sausage! And take the Cannoli! The cream is nice and smooth, no starchy texture. Going back next time we are in Vegas to try the pizza. :)"}
{"text":"Once again, a big thanks to fellow Yelpers for this Gem!  It's not far from the Strip and even if it was, it would be well worth the trip.  My wife and son loved the pepperoni pizza and I had the Italian #2 with the spicy ham (my mouth is watering just writing about it).  After my son polished off his pizza I gave him a bite of my sandwich and he immediately offered to eat the rest of it for me...no way!  But I did feel guilty about not sharing so I let him have a few more bites (but that's all).  The service was fast and really friendly.  We were on a mini vacation to Vegas and the next time we are in town, we are definitely making another pit-stop here, plus I want to try their Italian Ice as well."}
{"text":"Great shop, great guys. Love the food and helped me with so.e candles for my brothers birthday. Small touches like that on top of awesome food."}
{"text":"All hail Cuginos Deli!! Absolutely authentic NY/NJ delicatessen with fresh homemade Mozz says it all! Wish I could have this back in So Cal."}
{"text":"Nice pastrami sandwich... NY style pizza was Nic also... Service was nice to the table... Across from UNLV campus atmosphere..."}
{"text":"Wow! wait wait wait.....Wow! Entering the dining room its kind of just what you expect in a strip mall across the street from your local college. Its really a no non sense straight forward deli, order at the counter that has a few tasty items to look over inside of it, racks of some of the authentic product (and some not so authentic) that is used by the joint to create your tasty grub, and an old tube tv in the corner with the Italian soccer league playing for the fans (i am) of the soccer as well as the spot. I met a friend here for lunch this time visiting and ordered two sandwiches a meatball parm and a pastrami that both came with drinks for the price of $6.99 (meatball) and 7.99 (pastrami). Both came out within 5 minutes and good god i was surprised how much meat was on the pastrami sandwich. We traded halves so we can enjoy both and ill start with the meatball and just say this bread is heavenly soft and tasty, with a gravy that i honestly could put in a cup and drink its so tasty. The meatballs were straight forward, i didnt take any special blend of spices or savory flavor additionally as even if there was it was going to be masked by the lovely sauce and bread combo i was thoroughly enjoying topped off with generous servings motz cheese. The pastrami was served on a marble rye as it should be and as you can see from the other pictures provided is at least 1.5\" thick with just meat and its very juicy and flavorful. Deli mustard, onions and again generous portions of melted cheese round out this well crafted sandwich. The service is straight forward and welcoming, almost like a family ran atmosphere and the food is served quick, hot and good so that i have experienced. Best advice my review can offer you is TRY IT, and enjoy the tasty goodness of Cugino's."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Will now be my Go-To for my authentic Italian deli needs and comfort food!"}
{"text":"Pretty good cheese ravioli. I think it couldve been better if there was more salt. Wish they could make the food faster. Not a big fan of patient. Overall, i was happy with the food.  :)"}
{"text":"I was looking for something different during lunch and realized that the UNLV area was surprisingly close. Cue a visit to one of my older bookmarks in the area...  Cugino's Italian Deli is in one of those plazas across Maryland Parkway from UNLV. Despite its location, I saw few college-age customers in the dining area and none behind the counter. Even without the New York faux license plates and sports teams pennants on the wall, you could get some of the straightforward no-nonsense attitude from the employees.  You can also get pastas, sauces, deli meats, cheeses, and other Italian foodstuffs both packaged and fresh. I was more interests in the ready-made foods, which as you might expect include sandwiches, pizzas, and pastas.  I wasn't feeling up for a lunch special on my first visit (basically several normally priced items plus a free fountain drink) so I went with the eggplant parmesan sandwich ($9.99). It's not a super huge portion, but it has pretty decent bread, savory eggplant, delicious red sauce, and really gooey cheese. The banana pepper really went well with this sandwich too. It was probably a bit of a mistake to skip the meatballs though, and I wasn't getting that really deep satisfaction that I have from other sandwiches. I wouldn't say it was worth over ten minutes' wait.  I went back a couple of days later for that meatball parmesan sub ($8.99). I was hoping for a really mind-blowing meatball, but I got pretty good ones that are still unfortunately not the best that I've had out of a small Italian deli. Same cheese and red sauce didn't quite carry the day.  My favorite part about the second visit was the cannolis. They come both large ($3.75) and small ($1.75). After one bite, I felt regret at not getting the large one. Crispy crust, cold but not too sweet filling, and just enough chocolate. I would possibly come back for those. I haven't had a lot of cannolis, so this isn't saying too much, but they're the best I've had.  Cugino's is a decent lunch spot if you're in the area. I would give 3.5 stars in an ideal world (or an ideal rating system), but I was just was too underwhelmed in my two visits. I would come back to try some pizza or cold cut sandwiches if a friend invited me, but there are far superior hot sandwiches in town."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! So glad we came. I had the Tony Soprano and the bread and the flavors authenic....this place is a family friendly place and there was people speaking Italian here. The bread on my sandwich was amazing."}
{"text":"You have no idea why good pizza is until you eat here. I've at pizza all around the world and this is one of the best. Simple. Greasy. Pizza. Just perfect if you ask me. Plus, the crust has a slight crisp to it making it that much better.   On a side note, if you thought jersey shore are super Italian, you haven't been here! But that's the best part, the guys who work here are suuuppper nice and make you feel welcomed.   I'm telling you, if you want the experience with a side of grease and a cannoli to top it off, come here. Not next week, not tomorrow...NOW!"}
{"text":"Just wow. Being right across the street from UNLV is just so convenient. I came into this deli being really full but my friend offered me some Gelato, so I gave it a try. It was amazing one of the best Gelato I have ever had. I can't wait to come back and try their sandwiches."}
{"text":"My boyfriend always buys the frozen raviolis for me to make him for dinner.  They are phenomenal!  I never knew ravioli's could taste like this.  I swear they are like eating pillows or clouds that have been touched by a cheese-fairy.  We also purchase the Stromboli a lot.  My boyfriend enjoys the stuffed peppers but I don't enjoy them as much.  Prices here are super low and it is as authentic an Italian deli as I have found in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Authentic Brooklyn Italian family run deli & pizzeria in Vegas. So good. Highly recommend.  Coming back for the Italian ice next time! TIP: UNLV students with ID discount"}
{"text":"I love Cugino's I've tried a lot of their stuff but this last time we ordered a whole Sicilian pizza and it was phenomenal. Awesome mom and pop shop kinda feel."}
{"text":"So happy that we decided to check out this wonderful business. From the selection of specialty meats and cheeses, to the menu of food available to order, everything was fabulous.   We ordered a delicious antipasto salad that was topped with incredibly tasty salami and cheese. This salad totally set the tone for the treat we were in for. Our pizza came out, and my group devoured it. The crust was perfection. It was sturdy, with the perfect chewy yet crispy crunchy texture. It reminded me of my favorite pizza from my childhood. The meats used are for sure above average. The pepperoni was super flavorful, and delicious.   We indulged in Cannolis, and a slice of their homemade bread pudding. Where to begin? The cannoli was by far the best cannoli I've ever tasted. I did not want it to end. The filling is made in house, and let me tell you- it's heavenly. I was tempted to order a couple more to take home.   The bread pudding was surprisingly scrumptious. We ordered it on a whim after hearing them talk about their Mom just made it. I'm not typically one for bread pudding, and I never think to order it. In fact, my friend was the one that added it the order. Boy, am I glad she did. We sat there and savored each bite. Any time they have the bread pudding on special... order it. Trust me. It's Devine.   I will be back, probably this weekend with my entire family. I want to share this spot with everyone. Such a great experience!"}
{"text":"I have been here two times since I started working at UNLV.   The first time I went after work to get some spaghetti and meatballs for dinner. It was wonderful! A huge portion that really filled me up and left me with extra to enjoy the next day.   The second time I went, a friend met me for lunch and we each had a slice of Sicilian and the NY style. Two solid pieces of pizza. They were very efficient at getting the people through the line and they were fun people to talk to. Good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Love this place! Been coming here since my Freshman year of college? Which was in 2012~ I enjoy all their foods from their pasta to their Cannoli.  My favorites are the Lobster Ravioli, which can be a bit pricy but you are paying for Lobster, and the Cugino's Special Pizza.  The Pizza you can get the small size and be able to feed 2 people. Their Cugino's Special Pizza is probably one of my favorite pizzas, highly recommend~!"}
{"text":"Had the Donny sandwich, chicken parm sandwich and NY style cheese pizza!!! Wow fantastic is what I gotta say...!!!"}
{"text":"NY Italian deli feel. Family working the counter- not the friendliest. The sandwiches were nothing special. The bread was good, but the rest of it was pretty disappointing.   Maybe I should have ordered the garlic knots, spaghetti or pizza like everyone else said to. My fault for ordering the sandwich."}
{"text":"This is the real deal for traditional Italian delies. Fresh homemade mozzarella, the best srsncini ice ever had, and a wonderful selection of imported items that are hard to find. Just love this place!"}
{"text":"We visit Vegas maybe once a year, if that.  When we were there last June, we sought out this little place, off the strip, in kinda of a dirty little strip mall, across from UNLV.  Upon arrival, we were a little hesitant to go in but decided what the hell.  It was a small, casual place with Italian grocery items here and there, meats and cheeses hanging from the ceiling over the deli counters but you immediately get the feeling these folk know what they're doing.  The guy who took our order is the same guy who took it today.  He's the owner's son and understood our indecision.  We ordered a couple different items (antipasto, Stromboli, fresh homemade mozzarella, etc. are sold by the pound so you can get just enough to taste if you want to try several different items) and every last dish was fantastic.  Memorable even.  Their marinara is fresh and tomatoey and is served with most dishes as a dipping sauce.  Our guy checked on us several times to make sure we were enjoying everything.  We finished and had successfully overeaten but more so, we knew we'd be back. Today was the day.  We even skipped breakfast knowing this was our lunch destination.  We ordered enough antipasto to taste, a big enough sliver of the Stromboli to each try a little, garlic knots with marinara (holy omg ), a pepperoni and salami calzone to split and a small cannoli.  I'm pretty sure they add a little creamy ricotta with their homemade mozzarella to the calzone and what a unexpected treat.  But that marinara.  I swear it's half of why everything is so delicious.  We again successfully over-ate but don't regret it a bit.   The fact that this place is family owned, 1000% authentic & delicious and these guys are so friendly with those accents....it just wins every time.  We'll be back every trip!"}
{"text":"It is Sunday and he we are again . In short. WOW. This is much more than pizza. Tonight it is homemade cheese Ravioli with red sauce. Try it.You will like it."}
{"text":"This is a real italian deli, kind of hard to find now a days. Me being sicilian I really appreciate it. I had a hot pastrami, and it was probably the biggest and best pastrami sandwich I've ever had. It had like 2 inches+ of meat and I could barely fit the sandwich in my mouth! I thought I would never say this, but it was almost too much meat. I couldn't even finish it, and I'm a big guy. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"So a few years ago my brother tells me this story about how a few high rollers from New York wanted their pool cabana catered by a local deli.  To make a long story short these guys wanted some of the best and authentic New York style deli and Italian food in Las Vegas.    So we figure lets go check this place out. I'm proud to say that after about 5 years this is still one of my favorite places to eat in Las Vegas.  And that's not even with me getting to the food.  Julia and her family are the nicest, kindest,  sweetest people on this earth.  It doesn't matter if it's been a day, a week,  or a few months,  they take the time to chat with you.  Ask how the family has been and always have a smile on their faces. That awesome attitude translates into the food.  Fresh sauces made daily,  authentic New York style pizza,  garlic knots to die for,  and those rice balls.  When I first started going to Cugino's they weren't regularly available,  you had to ask or pre order them.  I always get the larger rice balls with the meat inside.  If you are eating in store ask them to heat it up and put some sauce and cheese on top. Everything from a basic plate of spaghetti to the linguini and clams is always top notch,  hot and amazingly fresh."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had an amazingly delicious lunch here!  We will definitely be back for more!  We had the eggplant parmesan sandwich and an Italian sub with the fresh hand sliced meats and homemade cheese..so delicious!  We got a couple of cannoli's to go for dessert.  Great place to go for lunch, get a homemade cannoli and an espresso then some groceries for home!  Awesome family run Italian deli and restaurant."}
{"text":"I came in from out of town on business and had a craving for some good pizza. I stumbled across Cugino's on yelp and said why not. When I went in it wasn't what I expected it was better. A small deli, grocer and pizza joint. My friends and I ordered the Cugino special Sicilian style pizza. Wait was a little long but it was worth it. The pizza was amazing. Crispy crust and delicious toppings. And the cheese, the cheese just kept going and going. After dinner we had the tiramisu and the cannoli's. Again they nailed it. The tiramisu was made in house along with the cannoli 's. I haven't had these deserts in years since my grandparents passed and it brought back memories of what I have been missing. And to top it off the family running the place were extremely friendly and kind. It's and Italian family and they make you feel like it like your apart of it."}
{"text":"Subway should be ashamed of themselves, calling what they make sandwiches i had the a cold sub for about 7 bucks, huge!!! with lots of meat, could only eat half of one half of the sandwich it was so large.  I would come back for the sandwiches alone, but will try something else next time..   Service very helpful, friendly"}
{"text":"Is simply the best in town!  The Donny special with marinated eggplant is the way to go.  Love this place and the family who owns it & runs it.  If someone introduces you to this place, you are lucky..."}
{"text":"Great place! Was in with a group of 9 - seating was tight, but we were able to find a spot during lunch. Excellent food. our group of 9 had 9 different items and everyone was very happy with food, and speed of service. First time here, didn't see the daily specials, but they are listed to the left of counter where you order. Everything is made to order - so don't be in a hurry. Two dollar signs for lunch $$ right at about $12 /person."}
{"text":"This place is great! Home cooking, fresh authentic Italian Deli! Recently went there and my wife ordered the Pastrami sandwich, Just take a look and judge for your self!"}
{"text":"The picture of the homemade mozz drew me in. Boy, was I sad. It was a $7 ball of tasteless solid white rubber. This is not the \"fresh homemade mozzarella\" any legit Italian would be caught dead selling. I'm embarrassed for you, Cugino. Either learn to do it right (and sell it only while fresh) or don't do it at all. Absolute waste of money."}
{"text":"The Godfather sandwich is probably the best sandwich I've ever had. Thick mozzarella, fried eggplant, and peppers so mild and tasty, it's amazing."}
{"text":"Holy crap this place is good! Their pizza is the closest thing to the best pizza I had (which is all the way in Connecticut). They are super friendly and their service is incredible. This is one of those places I'm willing to drive 25 miles to just foe the pizza!"}
{"text":"This sandwich is  and this place is old school AF. Traditional roast beef and cheese on a roll that was baked today by someone who obviously cares about the quality of what they are serving and the sandwich was made by one of the brothers who I'm sure is an owner operator of this local gem. Any asshole can get a $5 footling made a disgruntled employee who's still pissed off that Jared made as much as he did only to blow it in underage hookers or you can aspire to not be an asshole and come a real sandwich made by the people who's only goal is to make sure you're happy enough when you leave that you'll come back again. Support local business and get one hell of a sandwich at the same time. The pizza looks AF too btw"}
{"text":"My workplace caters from here and it's the best Italian food that I know of in Vegas. Granted I haven't tried any of the fancy places on the strip, this place is as real as it gets for me. It's tucked away, it's not what you expect when you walk in (I expected to see a full blown restaurant) but this place is great! Italian dressing for the salad is amazing! Highly recommended for pasta lovers!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Cugino's and this place is amazing! As soon as I walked in the aroma of fresh garlic knots and pizzas being baked lured me in. I  Ordered a dozen canollis and I was expecting to get them right from the case but little did I know they were going to make them fresh on the spot. I am extremely impressed I got them made to order. I will definitely be back tomorrow to order another item from there menu and every day after until I leave to go back to California. Cugino's is going to be on my number one list of places to visit every time I come back to visit Las Vegas. This was a great find I found on yelp thanks to all the pictures and comments. Thanks to all fellow yelpers! If you are looking for a old school Italian deli this is your best bet in Las Vegas!!"}
{"text":"The pizza was over prices and greasy and the staff was extremely rude. Placing the order on the phone, the guy talked down to me about how I made my original order (I said through yelp he corrected me on what the system is called like I know!) and when they came to deliver the lady called and was screaming at us like a manic like she had been there for hours. She called that one time. I would never recommend this place."}
{"text":"I like there tomato basil pizza but I also order there cannoli. The price of a very small one cannoli is way to expensive for $1.75."}
{"text":"I want to thank you all for making my chosen parents so comfortable and happy this past weekend. He comes from Coney Island, she comes from Brooklyn, and the high point of their entire Las Vegas trip was talking to you guys about the food, and tasting your wonderful dishes. We ate at high end, high dollar restaurants all week. But the best food we had all week was the food we had each afternoon (3 times, and packed a cooler to take home) with Cugino's. Thank you for all you do...."}
{"text":"Just happened to look for good NY pizza while here for the week for a conference & was extremely satisfied.  We came back twice.  Great sauce & cheese tasted fresh.  Garlic knots were great, not overly garlicky, just right.  We also got cookies to go & were a hit.  Peanut butter dipped in chocolate...  Yummy!!!  But the best part was the cheesecake.  OMG, it tasted like my Italian grandmother made it, if I had an Italian grandmother.  It was the best New York cheesecake I ever had.  It was so good plain, it didn't need strawberries or whip cream, perfect plain.  Will dream about tonight."}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place 5 stars but I can't. I'd like to start off by saying their Reuben Melt that I ordered was really good but i was really excited for their tiramisu which ended up being a huge disappointment.   I think this place is genuinely Italian so I assumed their tiramisu would be awesome instead, it came to me not even completely thawed, still a little frozen and tasted disgusting.  I've been to Asian dessert places where their tiramisu is great which is what got me started on the hunt for a great piece of tiramisu.   I guess I'm just really bummed that the one thing I was looking forward to didn't meet my expectations even at the lowest level. :("}
{"text":"If you love italian food and have not experienced cuginos you are missing some great food.  I have tried everything on the menu and have never been disappointed.    Everything is made to order so don't be in a hurry.  By far the best pizza pasta sandwiches etc in vegas.  Homemade sausage mozzerella rioctta now even italian chicken sausage"}
{"text":"Cugino's is the best., food is fresh, very clean."}
{"text":"Very rude and short when I called to make an order.  The menu prices aren't what they actually charge when you call and place the order, some how the prices jumped $20 and when I asked the person on the phone where the additional charge came from he became frustrated and said \"the price is the price.\""}
{"text":"Everything's imported from NYC and Italy, even the water for the pizza dough. This family run gem is rooted in NYC and has branched out. This is some of the best quality food I've found in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great food, a true Italian Deli. I ordered a chicken Parmesan sandwich which came out to about $7.99. The size was a bit disappointing for the price. But the food was good, my friend and I both ate for about $25. Overall, the food was good but maybe not the type of place I'd spend twenty bucks to eat.   The ambiance was nice, we were there late afternoon and it wasn't too busy. The inside of the place really gives you a traditional feel. The place does look a bit dated but I think that just adds to the old deli feel of the place.   Overall a good mom & pa restaurant. Support your locals!"}
{"text":"I bought 3 for work and they were quick about it. I drove in to pick up and it's a cool old school place. They do deliver btw. I would love to try more here from what I saw there, and pictures on yelp, everything looks good.  Large pizzas are pricey. I paid 64 for 3 large, good thing work paid for it. We had 1 veggie, 1 Margarita and 1 special. All were really good, not quite a 5 star, but still good, among the best so far I've had living in vegas, most of my other pizza experiences here have been ranged from VERY disappointing to just so so."}
{"text":"Thank you yelp! Another great find! I can see this becoming a go-to type of dinner place for me and my husband. The owners/staff are friendly, funny and kind. They really made us feel welcomed!  We were craving pizza; but we're on a budget so this is where we ended up!  It's a deli/restaurant where you can also get your Italian supplies, like pastas not carried at traders or Vons.  What we got: 1. A 10 inch Vegetarian pizza $9.99: 9/10. Thin crust, crispy, with mushrooms, olives, tomatoes, olives, onions and bell peppers. I would hold the bell peppers cause they taste canned. Everything else. Very fresh.  2. Spaghetti and meatballs 10.99. 9/10. Comes with breadsticks and a salad. Plus 4 homemade meat balls. Will request for more sauce next time  3. Large canoli $3: creamy and crisp. Very good 7/10.   Will be back!"}
{"text":"I'm not Italian. I'm definitely not from the east coast. I have never seen The Godfather or The Sopranos. But I believe this place offers great Italian food. And by reading other reviews, I am not alone in this assessment.   I love this place. I love that several of the customers and the owners act like they're family. I love the deli and the various Italian products. I love that when I was feeling under the weather and craving soup, they had pasta fagioli (and other soups, too) Do you know how hard it is to find a big  bowl of hearty soup around UNLV? Their caprese salad was a bit pricey at first glance ($8.99) but they give you a lot of fresh sliced mozzarella with basil and garlic. Again, where else am I going to get caprese salad within reasonable walking distance from campus? I am sad I didn't come sooner."}
{"text":"OMG..... This place is amazing from top to bottom!!!! I found it on Yelp and I was not disappointed.... When I walked in it was like being transported straight to New York .... The atmosphere is authentic New York deli ....all the guys behind the counter and even a couple customers had heavy NY accents...the guys working there were very nice to boot... I ordered an eggplant parmigiana sandwich macaroni salad and a cannoli ...the sandwich was possibly the best I've ever had perfect amount of sauce, usually I need extra but I didn't even have to use it ... It was very flavorful... And the bread was quality...and the sandwich stayed together wich is rare with a saucy sandwich ... Next was the macaroni salad ... Wich was very good and was very similar to lnl BBQ.... I haven't ate the cannoli yet because I had no room ... But I'm sure it's amazing as well!!!!!    Overall excellent and thoroughly satisfied .... I will definitely be returning"}
{"text":"Man, I feel badly about giving this place three stars. I mean, look at the other reviews! People seem to really like this place! So why do I, someone who loves pasta, just give it a three? Well, here we go...  When I first walked into this place, I thought \"Oh, man, this place looks legit!\" They sell tons of Italian products here, different kinds of meat, and has a ton of Italian-like memorabilia on the walls... kinda like what Applebee's would look like if it were decorated by Rocky Balboa. But, I didn't come here to look at this stuff. I came here to eat. Everything else is incidental.  I ordered the most basic thing on their menu that still qualifies as Italian: spaghetti with sausage. I should note that the servings come with bread and a salad, though neither are something to shout about: the lettuce wasn't 100% crisp, the ranch dressing wasn't really cold, and they were served on the kind of plastic plates I buy my baby cousin. Already I was getting less and less enthused.   About ten minutes after they brought out the salad came the pasta. Man, it smelled good! Its the kind of the smell that you have to kind of appreciate for a second before digging in! Unfortunately, the scent of the food was better than the food. The noodles were somewhat overcooked, it seemed, and were thinner than I like (though I do not take off points for that, as that's a personal preference of mine). The sauce was good, kinda... good like upscale pasta sauce I buy at Vons, but not good like an Italian person who knows their business made it. The sausage was good, though not spicy like I was expecting (and asked for).   On the plus side, the portions were fairly generous and prices were not too steep. The guy at the counter was nicer to us after a few minutes, though he was never really mean... more like he was tired because it was late.   All in all, I'll probably come here. A lot of the reviews here are really positive, and maybe my experience is an isolated one. But if I come back here again and this place is still a three, it'll be on my list of places to come when you're hungry and aren't feeling too picky."}
{"text":"Some of the best Italian food I have ever had and amazing Pizza! If you have the chance do not skip eating here!"}
{"text":"Blair will not approve of this review :) For the high-carb lover...*blush* you can trek over to Cugino's.  This is a family-owned Italian grocery and restaurant with pastas, antipasti, homemade pizza, Boars Head meats, deli sandwiches, eggplant parmesan, you name it. I have a particular fondness for their bread.  They look like mini loaves of baguette, and they are served warm.  Holy (@$)*% once I ordered three to go and thought I would share them with coworkers but I ate them all walking back to my office!!!  They also have yummy garlic knots! Today was a particularly stressful day - I was up til 3AM typing a paper, then got up early for work of course and felt like I deserved something yummy for lunch.  Cugino's has arancini - fried risotto balls stuffed with cheese rolled in seasoned breadcrumbs, served hot with marinara sauce.  WHOA, right?!  I added a mini baguette thingy and wa-la!  Carbilicious! These are super delicious, very different from the truffled ones at Ferraro's (those are more refined of course, and smaller).  I had 2 of these and that was plenty.  yum yum yum they only make a certain amount per day so I better not tell you any more of my noshing secrets :)  Oh yeah and the whole meal cost me under $4."}
{"text":"Wow, what can I say? Wow, Wow, How Now Brown Cow.  I've only tried the Americano 1 and the cheese pizza and the mocha latte. I'm only 24 but is it too early to say that that was the best Turkey Sub I've ever had in my life?  The cheese pizza was good, legit.  The Americano was so good, I stole my little sisters leftover and ate it the next morning for breakfast.  Definitely a 9 out of 10. I think the Turkey would have been better if it was Lobster.  Better than Passion of the Christ.  BETTER than Lethal Weapon 4."}
{"text":"We started out with arancini (rice balls) and a sampler platter that was good so we were excited about our chicken pizza that was coming. Unfortunately the chicken on the pizza was breaded. Like pieces of chicken fingers that were cut up and put on the pizza. Either we missed that fact or it's not on the menu - but we do not suggest getting the chicken pizza at all ever. The service was good and the food was hot and fresh- but that pizza killed it for us."}
{"text":"In a strip mall across from UNLV, this casual family-owned shop is a great local eatery with easy parking. The garlic bread knots come with great marinara sauce. The pizza is huge with a nice crust, and they don't skimp on cheese & toppings. The chicken milanese is great. Lightly breaded, not oily, served on a salad with side of penne marinara and bread sticks. The food is served with orange trays, paper plates, and metal utensils, but don't let that fool you, the quality is there."}
{"text":"Great food, I recommend Donnie's Special ... their Cesar salad is better than most. A little odd walking into a store type environment, but the food is good and the name Deli should clue you in to this fact. I regret not also ordering their Ruben. That looks so savory."}
{"text":"We don't have a Little Italy in Vegas, but Cugino's takes up the slack. It's like Tiny Italy.  I first heard about the place at a whiskey drinking session. A friend picked up some meats and cheeses from this deli that I had never heard of but vowed to one day visit. Then Lisa L gets ROTD. I decided it was high time.  I went for lunch last Friday. Walking in there, I felt like I was in New York. The place is so Italian, right down to the incredibly friendly people working there. I decided to get a Meatball Parm and some slices of prosciutto. Man. That sandwich was off the hook! The prosciutto was also great, but I went cheap by getting the domestic ($13 a pound). Next time, I'll try the imported ($20 a pound). I was amazed at how full I was after the Meatball Parm and five slices of prosciutto. Maybe because the sandwich came with a 20oz soda.  I wish I knew about this place when I was going to UNLV. Or maybe they weren't there yet. In any case, Cugino's is definitely getting added to my lunch rotation."}
{"text":"The best in the Las Vegas. I dream about the pastrami sandwich from here. fresh marble rye. Also try the italian tripe soup. all the mozzarella is made fresh by mom. This is the super secret spot in Vegas."}
{"text":"Cugino's Deli and Pizza delivers the deliciousness of New York pizza and eggplant parmesan subs to Maryland. That is  Maryland Parkway in Las Vegas, Nevada.      Born and raised in the New York metropolitan area, I grew up with sicilian pizza and eggplant parmesan subs that we call heros in New York. Thanks to businesses such as Cugino's Deli and Pizza, I get to relive the remarkable taste of New York pizza and eggplant parmesan subs.      Cugino's is located in the Runnin Rebel Shopping Center directly across the street from the UNLV Student Union. College students are amongst the many people that patronize this New York transplanted deli pizza restaurant.     The one thing that UNLV cannot teach is a zest for trying new places. This Yelp's job. When I was searching to find a new pizza place, Yelp led me to Cugino's. Subsequently I dined there two times in the last couple of weeks. On the first visit, I enjoyed their $5.99 two slice sicilian pizza special with a fountain beverage then on the second visit I savored an egg plant parmesan hero on toasted bread.      When I stepped into Cugino's, the inside put me in a New York State of Mind. If you have seen Greenberg's Deli in NY-NY, it trails behind this deli. When I looked straight, my eyes took in a display case that included deli staples such as Boar's Head. When I looked to the right my eyes saw the counter, deli groceries, and an additional dining room. When I looked to the left my eyes took in a TV, New York memorbelia including the NY Met's logo, and a refrigerator featuring Dr. Brown's soda. When I looked down, I saw my food on the table. I will discuss the in the following two paragraphs.       When I bit into the sicilian pizza, it was a historical personal Las Vegas dining moment. From the time that I moved here in September 2004 and the preceding Las Vegas vacations, never do I recall eating sicilian pizza. Sicilian is a square pizza that is usually thick. Anyway, since this is the leading sicilian pizza that I recall eating in Las Vegas it truly is the best that I had in this city. Comparing it to New York sicilian pizza is a different ball game. If I compared it to New York sicilian pizza, it is good. After leaving Cugino's and walking toward Coffee Bean, I was determined to return to here try their eggplant parmesan sub.      My determination paid off when I tried their eggplant parmesan sub on toasted bread. The eggplant parmesan sub on toasted bread was out of this world delicious. The $9 and change that I exchanged for the sub was money well-spent. With the fountain drink (only one refill allowed), it came to around $13. In similar style to my previous visit, I paid at the counter, the man filled my soda cup, I waited at the table taking in the New York deli scene, then a few minutes in the future he brought the food to my table. In my opinion, Cugino's did a better job with the eggplant parmesan sub than the sicilian pizza. The eggplant parmesan sub gives New York pizzerias a run for their money. Writing this makes me hungry as I think about the thick juicy eggplant enveloped with mouth watering mozzarella cheese topped off with red sauce between warm toasted bread. Kudos to Cugino's for capturing the taste of a New York eggplant parmesan sub.      I really appreciate that in recent years the taste of New York eggplant parmesan subs and pizza is following me to Las Vegas as more pizzerias and Italian restaurants open and Yelp opens my mind to the established restaurants. The upshot is that I appreciate Cugino's Deli and Pizza."}
{"text":"Thank you pizza Gods, for bringing me this delicious slice of pie.    The reviews don't lie - this place is LEGIT!!   I'm not usually big on Italian food, but a good slice of pie?  That's a different story.  Everything about their pizza is fresh - the crust was the perfect thickness and texture (crunch on the outside, soft in the middle,  just the right amount of (homemade) cheese, and perfectly cooked toppings.  I'm usually a one-slice kind of girl, but I couldn't stop eating this pizza.  Oh - and the garlic knots?  I bought three (two for the b/f, one for me)...and I ate two of them myself before I even got the pizza home.  GO HERE.  It will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Nice welcoming place when you want real Italian food in Vegas without all the glitz."}
{"text":"Great experience. Good food, great service. Family owned and operated.  Hey, if Italians are eating here, so am I. We had the spaghetti and meatballs, fried ravioli and small rice ball. My wife and I were stuffed and are definitely coming back to try pizza and other items."}
{"text":"Finally tried Donnies Special sandwich & boy it was delicious-just as good as the Yelpers say! I highly recommend trying it!  Everything else was tasty & authentic, as always.. their bolognese sauce is out of this world!  Cugino's simply never let's us down!"}
{"text":"Best Reuben in town!!!! That's my favorite sandwich, so I've tried several around Las Vegas.  I think I only had one visit where something wasn't right about the sandwich.  Maybe the bread was over toasted or something.  But, even a sandwich can have an off day,... so it's worth trying again!  =)  I made frequent visits here while attending UNLV.  Great garlic knots,  pizzas and pastas!  There's always daily specials too!  The people are always nice.  Genuine and makes sure that you're taken care of.  :)"}
{"text":"I am a bit torn on this place- the food was really tremendous. Large portions. However, the delivery driver was rude and they messed up my order and were downright unapologetic.   I enjoyed the Rueben very much. The garlic knots were great. The kids enjoyed the pizza. However, they shorted me one order of bread knots on the delivery. when I called the restaurant, the accused me of lying. They then tried to blame the delivery driver. The driver then blamed the restaurant. Bad customer service."}
{"text":"LOVE...I am in love...with the yummies at Cugino!!!  Cheese Pizza...Thin crust with chewy yet crispy & STRETCHY house made mozzarella cheese...We fought our 6 year old daughter for the last piece!!!  Oh well, she will survive \"wink.\"  Meatball with Penn pasta...yum...the star is the SAUCE.  We can drink the stuff.    Sausage, Pepper and Onion Sandwich...Every ingredients were perfect! Grilled sausages, (not overcooked in sauce like some places).   Recommendation:  add mozzarella cheese and ask for sauce on the side to dip.    Lastly... for dessert Cannoli...love the crispy shell.  The ricotta cream was very good.  Too bad I've been spoiled by New York's Veniero & Le Bella Ferrara...YET Cugino is WAYYYYYY friendlier!  BTW, I would give them a sixth star for being a \"Mets\" fan!"}
{"text":"A taste of Brooklyn right in Las Vegas! Franco and family are the real deal. Fresh mozzarella made daily, that's almost impossible to find nowadays folks. Prosciutto and mozzarella hero off-the-charts. Homemade sausage delicious.Amazing pizza. This family knows the best and they ship in Pastosa Ravioli and Manhattan Special from Brooklyn. In this world of big-box shopping/corporate restaurants this place is a breathe of fresh air, go in and talk to the friendly staff, talk to the Pop, talk to the Mom or talk to the son. Let them feed you and make you happy, that's what they dedicated their life to!!!"}
{"text":"I'm tempted to give this place 5 full stars, but I'll reserve that review after a full sampling of the menu. So far, ridiculously good!  I've been there twice in the last same number of days. I had their Lasagna Bolognese yesterday, and their Spaghetti with Marinara sauce today. The Lasagna with their home-made ricotta was gigantic, piping-hot and straight out of the oven, and wonderfully seasoned for my taste (which is light on salt and right on spices). Their Spaghetti was on the money with slightly tart marinara that tasted fresh, and a portion size that could easily satisfy two patrons with a shared appetizer.   The place seems family owned, and you'll find a splattering of Italian regulars that chat it up with the lady at the counter. This place is good. Everything from their Italian dressing, to simple breadsticks, and pizza that my dining partners had -- I gotta try more pizza for sure -- all of it is just good.   The restaurant/deli has a wide selection of fresh deli meats and cheeses, home-made mozzarella and ricotta, and appealing-looking sandwiches that are very reasonably priced, and I suspect, will be delicious when I try. This place is 4.5 right now! Try it, like it, repeat."}
{"text":"Great little italian gem. It felt like I was tasting food on the east coast.   Great quality food, good seating for groups (of course college kids), and big portions (good quality sandwiches that will last you and great on the wallet).  Try the Pastrami sandwiches for lunch. Its a must long with some garlic knots!...Pizza is not that bad either"}
{"text":"Yum! Had the Italian #1 and rice ball. Good atmosphere and family owned business, nice people."}
{"text":"im from new york, and now i live in california and im tired of going to places that say they have the best new york pizza and dont!, but this place has every right to say they have the best new york style pizza, i started to weep when i took the first bite!! to be honest it was kinda the best new york pizza ive ever had, atleast the top 5! i dream about your pizza!!!! living here in west hollywood california is no fun when i get a pizza craving and cant quench my craving for that delicious pizza!!! can you mail it?????"}
{"text":"Love it here! Las Vegas pizza but with New York taste and even greater people, I felt like home the instant I walked in and felt even better by the time I left   Love it here, can't wait to bring everyone I know"}
{"text":"This is a HUGE FIND in Las Vegas where delicious pizza seems to be a mystery.  The storefront is in a little strip mall by UNLV and is 100% worth going trying.  We ordered a white pizza and a pepperoni pizza, an antipasto salad and they gave us an extra little order of the bulk antipasto to try.    The pizza was INCREDIBLE!!!!!  And for $30 for all of it we were pleasantly surprised.  I would recommend this to anyone and will be going back to try some of their other items - I saw their meatballs and they looked incredible too.    Try this place!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"had their meatball parmigiana, stuffed completely, toasty, perfect....Employees were extremely nice and helpful in my decision"}
{"text":"I can see why this is 4.5 star's! Pizza and calzone whata great combination! I love them both! If your in doubt, don't be this will be my new pizza place!! The sauce is not to bold and the right amount of spices and cheese!"}
{"text":"Every time I visit Las Vegas, I always have to make a stop at Cugino's.  The people are friendly, the atmosphere is nice, and most importantly the pizza is great.  However, last time I took my mom and she ordered the Eggplant parmigiana and I don't think it's a do over.  It just didn't impress me and it was $12. I usually get the large cheese pizza and it's excellent.  I visited NYC for NYE and was able to try NY style pizza in New York.  I ate pizza every day while I was there.  This place definitely comes close and I won't have to fly all the way to NYC to get great pies.  I wish that Cugino's would have some garlic and onion powders so we could put on our pizza though in addition to the Parmesan Cheese and peppers.  Also, the workers here are always so friendly!  We went close to closing (8pm) and they welcomed us with open arms.  We also ordered an order of garlic knots (6pc in an order) and he brought out an extra order of knots for us! Granted, it was close to closing and they were probably going to throw it away anyways, but still, it made us happy!  Definitely a fan of Cugino's!"}
{"text":"While the food is always amazing, the service is never consistent.  My standards aren't exactly high for a counter service pizza/ sandwich joint but a smile, thank you or an apology when they forget your slice of pizza goes a long way.  You won't be disappointed with the food but don't  expect a friendly family feel."}
{"text":"You must also try the Donny's Special.  It's not on the menu, but it's quite delicious!"}
{"text":"Best pizza period. Best Reuben sanwich I have ever had. Calamari was delicious.  Couple of small complaints.Dining area kinda small and a little too hot in there. One the employees was kinda of grumpy) But I would not hesitate to go back."}
{"text":"I'm originally from Queens, NY, and NY pizza is my idea of what good pizza is all about  Cugino's achieves pizza greatness  The crust is thin, but manages to be crispy AND chewy in all the right ways, the sauce is great, tastes homemade, and the cheese is delicious  We order one large cheese pizza, and take some back to the hotel after we have a couple of slices  It's the closest thing to NY pizza for me. I live in So. Cal, and there's one or two good places, but Cugino's is better  We start every Las Vegas trip with a stop at Cugino's"}
{"text":"I really don't understand the reviews on this place. My entire crew of nine was underwhelmed by the food we ordered. I got the Cuginos Special Sandwich. There was plenty of prosciutti on it, but it was the saltiest prosciutto I'd ever had. The bread and balsamic dressing wasn't anything special, and the mozzarella lacked the creamy flavor I love about good mozzarella.  That not so good sandwich was $9.00, and to top it off customer service was lacking.   Try this deli if you want, but definitely don't drag all of your coworkers here off of hwy 15 based on these other yelp reviews."}
{"text":"My Eastside Familia, and go to place for Pizza, Subs, Pasta and cannoli's  Lots of other good things to try.  They make a Reuben that's so big we usually have to split it between us for under 10 dollars!  Consistently good food and service"}
{"text":"I ordered a cheese and pepperoni pizza from this place,because I saw it had quite a few awesome reviews so I thought I'd try it out. This pizza is absolutely amazing! I think this is going to be my new favorite spot, I know pepperoni pizza is pretty hard to mess up but you'd be surprised lol. As a local I'd have to say this is definitely one of the better pizza places that I've gone to!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best pizza shops that's I have eaten at while visiting Las Vegas. The food is fresh and made to order. Even their deserts are delicious.  But I had to subtract 2 stars because they do not offer Military and Law Enforcement discounts. Also, they do not greet you once you enter their restaurant."}
{"text":"I think I should also mention that Cugino's best item is their homemade Mozzarella.  Many of you may be wondering why Italian's love Mozzarella so much, it's so average at most places you get it.  But once you have real Mozzarella, you immediately understand.  Cugino's makes it fresh everyday, many times several times a day.  It is creamy, salty, and has the perfect texture for mozzarella.  You can slice this stuff and eat it raw, and you will finish it within a couple minutes.  If you've never tried it, go get it now!"}
{"text":"We had the nicest time in Vegas until we tried to leave... and got stuck for a night. We found a decent hotel and it was a short 25 minute walk to Cugino's. We both were very happy we did. The garlic knots were small, but delicious! Salad was good. ClamWin pizza was amazing. The side of meatballs and sauce was yummy, but a lil bit cold.  The food was above average. The service was the most pleasant part of our honeymoon trip. Very friendly faces. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I accidentally stumbled upon it a few years ago when I met my friend who was a student at UNLV for lunch. We didn't know where to go and decided to go here.  It is a great NYC style deli that I'm so happy I found. The must have items that I order every time are their stuffed peppers and their cannoli's. The peppers are stuffed with bread stuffing and soaked in italian dressing. They are both to die for and taste so good!   I usually get the chicken parm sub but this time I split the linguini with tomato basil sauce with my mom. It was a perfect portion for us to split since we both don't usually eat large portions. It was yummy but since I'm not a huge fan of cut up tomatoes I would have preferred a marinara sauce. I would recommend trying the chicken parm sub over the pasta. It's one of the best subs I've ever had.  At the deli they also serve other hot and cold subs, pasta, and deli items. You can also buy boxed pasta and other Italian food items. We tried their raviolis they sold in the past and they were really good!   They also sell italian rainbow cookies that they make and those are amazing! A little pricey though (12.99 a lb...) But worth it every once in a while for a splurge!   If you are a big Italian food fan you need to check out Cuginos. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Don't understand all the hype. I won't even waste more money on a second chance.  I ordered for the first time and hubby and I thought it was all gross. Cuginos special pizza was soggy and tasteless. Sauce bland. Fried gnocci tasted like whatever was fried in oil before it. Large meat sauce would be called size small everywhere else and barely any meat in it. Rice ball parmingiana was the only thing I was able to eat as I dumped the rest. I didn't enjoy it really, it was more of a I paid $40 and am hungry thing. The sauce isn't that good so it killed the rest. was too mushy couldn't tell it was a rice ball really more of a mush ball.  No thanks, I wouldn't eat here again even if it was free."}
{"text":"Came with the family and ordered fried zucchini, 2 philly cheese steaks and a sausage and peppers/onions sandwich.  All were very good.  They have also serve Pelligrino by the large bottle so were given a few cups to share.  Located in a strip mall right across the street from UNLV.  Fairly large and they have a large TV so you can watch football while eating.  A steady stream of customers in and out.  Prices were a little steep as just a sandwich was $8.99, but they do offer daily specials, which I didn't notice the board until after ordering.  Solid choice though."}
{"text":"My husband is very picky about pizza/sauce, but he approves!  The garlic knots were so tasty! The marinara sauce that it came with had a kick to it... YUM!  We also ordered a chicken parm sandwich and a two slice cheese pizza combo (with soda). The prices and portions were awesome! You can tell that the bread on the sandwich was made fresh. The sauce and crust on the cheese pizza were perfectly made.   The cannoli was unique - there was a hint of cinnamon to it.  Can't wait to return to try the other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic Italian food, this is the spot! The baked ziti was superb and their Italian Subs are a fresh option. The vibe is what really made this place feel like home (Long Island). Will for sure be coming back!"}
{"text":"Great tiramisu and homemade mozzarella. The pizza sucked. The Italian # 2 sandwich is about the best Italian sandwich in town. A nice Italian deli and place to grab a lunch."}
{"text":"Very authentic East Coast Italian food. Homemade sausage, mozzarella and excellent sandwiches. I'm going to try the pizza next and I'm already looking forward to it. The staff was excellent and the service was great. Best of all it's only about 1 mile from where I work. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place was incredible.  The wife found it, so respect to her.  I had Donnie's Special, a huge chicken cutlet on a perfect roll with peppers, onions, lettuce, balsamic vinegar, and mozzarella cheese.  The cheese was the real deal.  Thick mozzarella.  I did a lot of thinking, because I didn't want to be hyperbolic, but I am pretty sure this is the best sandwich I've eaten in Las Vegas, it's between the Donnie and catfish sloppy joe at RM Seafood at the very least.  The bun was crusty at Cugino's, but held everything together well.  And, this is a LARGE sandwich, side of chips not necessary.  The balsamic was an awesome addition to the sandwich.  Finally, very thinly sliced onions, always a good addition.  My wife had the Cugino's special, which is basically the same as the Donnie's, but with prosciutto.  It frankly had so much prosciutto on it, I wondered how they made a profit.  Another enormous sandwich.  I look forward to eating here again very soon to try everything.  But, I don't know how I can go here and not get Donnie's Special."}
{"text":"Went to this place yesterday for lunch after searching for a decent Italian place on Yelp.  What a great decision.  Had the Sausage and Pepper sandwich and my wife had the Turkey sandwich with dressing (Thanksgiving dinner sandwich).  They were both excellent.  Will definitely not be the last time we go to this place.   Just wish it was closer to our house!"}
{"text":"The service here is terrible. Wait for fresh pizza takes too long if youre working in the area...youre left with the dried cold reheated pizza thats available otherwise"}
{"text":"I can honestly say, that I've had the best \"Italian\" named Italian sandwich, in my X3 years of life.  Granted, it's official name was \"Italian #2\" but, I'm sure I'd like #1 too.  My #2 had Salami, Cappicolo and Provolone, very simple right?  It was one flavorful sandwich, with a bang.  The ingredients, meats and cheese were fresh as you could taste the flavors of everything.  I especially loved the Cappicolo, which provided such a kick to the sandwich.  I've eaten Cappicolo before but, it was more like cRappicolo because it never tasted anything like this!  The s/o ordered one of their Canolli's.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Mh84_j7YmRrAcm0DWV4bUw?select=ub8c8QJ5J1U2B-hbfpYvLA  It was delish and cheap!  I love everything about Cugino's; their shop, the food, the overall feel, the smell of the shop, not sure what it is but Italian deli's have \"that smell\" and lastly, the family that runs it is pretty nice.  Cugino's, among the million other things about Vegas, sure makes me wish I lived there, well maybe more towards Henderson. :)  In the meantime, my jealousy shall continue."}
{"text":"They don't seem to have the beef patties anymore. Boo! Still a solid choice for when I'm on that side of town."}
{"text":"Had the meat ravioli and a side of sausage. Amazing food. Wife got penne with vodka sauce and grilled chicken. She requested we come back again which is rare for her. I will gladly oblige the next time we're in town. Diamond in the rough off the strip."}
{"text":"Despite the high rating, I just wasn't that impressed with this place.  I wanted to like it, I really did.  I loved the ambiance and the fact that the staff spoke Italian to each other.  I didn't even mind waiting 20 minutes for a pre-made peice of pizza and steak sandwich...  That much... :-)  All that being said, the pizza was not that good.  In fact it was mediocre at best.  I would prefer something from the mall.  It wasn't Dominos bad, but it wasn't Gino's in Chicago good by any means.  The dough was really tasteless and the rest wasn't that good either.  The sandwich was ok, but I would expect more."}
{"text":"What a wonderful discovery!!  Absolutely loved everything that we had there!  Definitely stopping there every trip to Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Seriously where has this place been all my life? I have seen it before passed it so many times and I'm literally thinking to myself what is wrong with you?! Only reason I knew of this place is because the boyfriend had bookmarked it a while ago. I checked it out on yelp saw pictures, read some reviews and that's all I needed. I will admit some places on yelp are all hype but that's something I like to figure out myself. Not this place. Noooo no my friends. This place is the real deal.   Upon seeing it from the outside you wouldn't think it's an actual restraunt with the blinds barely opened. It just looks like a little Italian market. When you go in you see some booths in the middle and cases of San Marzano tomatoes on the side. They have shelves of Italian pastas, sauces and other Italian ingredients. Then my friends is the display case. Italian cheeses, meats, desserts and oh my goodness Italian heaven.   My boyfriend was in the mood for pasta so he ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and I ordered the Italian with Capicola. Not sure what number that is. We sat down and the food came right out.   Spaghetti & meatballs - as tender as the meatballs were they had to be cooking a while & the sauce. Oh man. Real authentic red sauce. Deeeelish.   Italian - they are not playing with this sandwich. Piled high with Salami & capacola topped with thick slices of provolone , lettuce, tomato, onion, oil & vinegar. It's served on freshly baked french bread which I think is important and made the sandwich stand out even more. This was so good. You know it's a good sandwich when you have more meat to bread ratio and that I don't mind at all. Next time I would just ask for a little bit less of the vinegar. Otherwise It was so good. That bread. Oh man that bread.   I can't wait to bring my family here. Yes it's small but when you come here you feel like family. The people who run this place are very helpful and friendly. I can't wait to come back and try the pizza and the rice balls and the meatball sandwich. Omigahhhhh I want to try everything ! Lol I  will definitely be back to try something this place is the bees knees ! Believe the hype. It's real."}
{"text":"My go to place for pizza...I am originally from NJ and when I need pizza this is where I go.  A great family operation hailing from System Island NY.  You get house made sausage and a full deli and small supermarket for your Italian food needs"}
{"text":"A favorite of mine that is often forgotten about... I stopped in for lunch yesterday and grabbed a couple of sicilian slices (square slices for those unfamiliar) and a rice ball. Two things that are often hard to find in Vegas.... at least of this quality. I couldn't wait to eat my pizza so ate a slice in the car on the way back to the office and it was glorious. Brings me back to the good old days back in NY.  If you haven't had a sicilian pizza, you are missing out and this is one of the best in town. They go a little heavier on the cheese than I like but that is typical for sicilian pies. I prefer mine with less cheese and more sauce. After all, anyone can get good cheese... not everyone can make a good sauce.  The rice ball was great as always... walking into this deli is like transporting right to Brooklyn for me. If this place was just a bit closer to work (or home) I would probably be there a few times a week."}
{"text":"Such amazing pizza! Quality and taste we great! Service was exceptional. Had the meat lovers pizza and canolis they were delicious! Definitely going back for my next pizza craving!"}
{"text":"The best place to get pizza in Las Vegas I've been coming here for eight years now I've had lots of pizza places in Las Vegas sum are good sum are OK but nothing gets me more excited then this place!! I love it here I love the staff I love the pizza I love the specials I love the decoration I wish I lived next-door to this place what do I recommend honestly everything from sandwiches to the pizza"}
{"text":"Yum!  My fiancé and I ended up at Cugino's randomly after using the \"shake\" function on my Urbanspoon app... fun times!  Anyway, when we walked in, we were greeted with an epic-sized crowd for the lunch rush.  That's always a good sign.  My fiancé ordered the meatball sub and a slice of pizza, and I had the pasta fagioli and a chef salad.  The sub was really good - the cheese was so... melty and the sauce was delish.  My soup was a little under seasoned, but a little salt fixed that right up.  It was a good meal in a great atmosphere.  We will be back."}
{"text":"My hubby was hungry for Italian food. Looked on Yelp and this was the highest rating and decided to try it out. Ordered at the counter and food was brought to our table. Delicious, amazing food and a lot of it. We ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, chicken parmigana, and penne a la vodka. Some of our entrees came with salad and breadsticks. Our total came to $50 and is usually more than we like to spend on a meal but would definately come back. I would order the penne a la vodka again, for sure!!"}
{"text":"This place lives up to it's highly rated billing.  My wife says it's a classic Italian NY deli and the food is awesome.  I had the grilled chicken sandwich with broccoli rabe (leaves) and it's very tasty.  The chicken breast is very moist and soaked in all of the flavors.  What a good deal at $9.99.  My mother in law had the linguine with clams, which was cooked al dente.  Not bad, a classic dish, big portion.  Another good deal at $14.99.  My wife had the pastrami sandwich, very lean meat but still moist and perfectly seasoned with a good peppery taste.  You won't ask \"where is the beef\" as the sandwich is huge.  Ordered the garlic knots and rice balls as sides, as if we needed to eat more.  Both were excellent!  Goes well with the classic marinara sauce they provide.  A great find, as I'm getting tired of the eating places on the Strip, getting too pricey."}
{"text":"A few friends were discussing how dismal so many pizza places are here in Vegas. As the topic shifted to places that are worth a try, one friend recommended Cugino's near UNLV. My wife and I stopped in about a month ago was was VERY pleased with the pizza they served. We just stopped in again today and was equally pleased. I have lived here for 8 years and this is serioulsy one of the best pizzas I have found in the valley. If I remember correctly they make their own sausage. The crust is fantastic, hand made, a nice crispness, even the smell alone screams quality. We have also had the bread knots and the toasted/fried ravioli. I havent seen toasted ravioli on a menu since I have moved here. Everything has been delicious.  We are looking forward to exploring other aspects of the menu, including some things we are not familiar with, but must be more popular on the east coast, including rice balls, and Jamaican beef patties. They also sell various sauces, olives, homemade sausage n' cookies, and other Italian goodies for the kitchen. Pizzalicious!"}
{"text":"Loved the family atmosphere and home cooked food.  The owners moved from NY to Las Vegas years ago and brought their yummy Italian recipes with them.  The lasagna, pizza, and pre-packaged tiramisu were great.  Only a short drive from the strip and well worth the cheaper home cooked food."}
{"text":"Great. All the way around, great. We love getting carryout. Sandwiches, fried sides, all travels great along with the pizza."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time and it was digestible. This place is inconsistent lately, sometimes ok and usually bad--it has taken a nose dive recently. Please get better! Your meatballs were tough and tasteless except for excessive garlic and your pasta is soft and gross, gravy is sugary and acidic...must be lousy or cheap canned tomatoes. Prices are high for the junk food you serve--so bad. Your servers are rude, especially to women and children, kind of strange, maybe I need to be Vegas gorgeous with no kids, or servers think I won't tip? The place looks dirty! Really filthy. I saw a big black thing pass me in my booth and it could have been a cockroach. I would not be surprised if you get closed down. I recommend that everyone find a better place!"}
{"text":"Large portion, the food was hot, and prepared on time for pick-up but I am just disappointed. The fettuccini alfredo was bland. Not creamy and just no real flavor. I just knew it was going to be da bomb after reading the reviews. My friend got the spaghetti and he says it's really good but mine wasn't :(. In my 20's my neighbor Ms. Iannucelli would cook and it spoiled me. Maybe nothing will ever compare."}
{"text":"This was a great place!. My husband and I love Italian foods and this was really awesome!  We chose to go here following fellow reviewers and it was the best choice we've made in a while.  My favorite was their fresh homemade mozzarella, OMG A+++  And the sweet sausage was the bomb to say the least.  We will definitely be buying all our items from here, especially anytime we make our large Italian dinners for special occasions!  Awesome job guys thank you!"}
{"text":"This is much better than most sub shops or Italian places here in the city. But if you are used to old school East Coast Italian you won't be too enthralled either. The actual menu has more offerings than the lighted board on the wall , just an FYI.  The veal was real veal not some cheap patty, but it was a little tough. The calamari is a little expensive for what you get.  The sauce was fine,  Very casual place, must be nice for people who live nearby because you can order online and get deli meats here etc too.  The service was friendly in a slightly terse kind of way. The pizza looked good may try one day."}
{"text":"I'm from Jersey and I gotta admit that this place is bomb. They might even be better than some deli's back East, in fact. I've never been disappointed with anything: from the chicken parm to the rice balls, even the pizza is awesome. They even have Pastosa ravioli!!!  Feels exactly like a spot back home, too, which is awesome.  Love me some Cugino's..."}
{"text":"I decided to try Cugino's Italian Deli on Thursday of last week. Since then, I have been eating there every single day! Talk about addicting.. right?   I have a soft spot for everything and anything Italian, so this place was absolute perfection in my eyes. It's a family owned deli and the people who work there are great! They remember their customers and make conversation with them to make sure the food is to their liking.   So far I have tried the Calamari, Frutta Di Mare, and the Spaghetti and meatballs.   -The spaghetti and meatballs was the first thing I tried from Cugino's and let me tell you it definitely hooked me. The pasta was cooked to a perfect texture and the meatballs were quite tasty.   -The Calamari was served in a generous portion and was cooked exactly the way I like it. The breading was well seasoned and tasted great with the marinara sauce. Definitely a favorite of mine.  - The Frutta Di Mare was a mix of clam meat, mussel meat, tiny shrimp, and calamari in a zesty red sauce over a bed of linguine. The seafood was plentiful and wasn't too overpowering, which I enjoyed.   I think this place is definitely a must try here in Vegas. If you haven't tried Cugino's already, you are missing out."}
{"text":"First time here, found them on yelp on my way to a class at UNLV. GREAT pizza and a great special, 2 slices of cheese pizza and a drink for $5"}
{"text":"Still no luck finding good pizza in Vegas  We had a large pepperoni, onion and pepper pizza. It was burnt on the bottom and covered in runny grease on top. The sauce was ok.  We also had some cannolis and they were fantastic. Two stars for that! The place is full of yummy smells and lots of prepared foods. I'll be going back for some of that."}
{"text":"Amazing!! Authentic italian food! We tried the pastrami melt and chicken sandwich and a side of potato wedges and it was really good! I highly recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"Thank god for this place. I'm from Baltimore and I've been trying to find a place that fills the Little Italy sized hole in my heart since I left. Well I finally found it! We got a slice of pizza, a pastrami sandwich, and a cheesesteak sub. The pizza is real New York style pizza. The best pizza I've had since I left the eat coast. The philly cheese steak was tasty and full of steak. Pastrami was real Jewish deli style pastrami. All delicious. And the cannoli was yummy too. I will definitely be coming back here any time I get nostalgic about the east coast. Thank you Cuginos for making my heart a little warmer!"}
{"text":"The food is just OK, prices are a little high and the people who run the place  Are rude and very unconcerned."}
{"text":"Everything was so amazing. Italian ices were just like back east. My penne alla vodka was the best I've ever had and my mom loved her spaghetti. She said the meatballs tasted just like her grandma's. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Let me first say that the people running this place were very friendly. I had the white pizza during my visit and it was mediocre at best. Overloaded with Gorgonzola.. My lady and I only ate a few pieces and the pizza was just not tasty. We also had the Garlic knots. Those were just ok as well. We were somewhat disappointed but credited the bad food experience with the fact that they were about 30 mins from closing. Probably won't try again, but 5 stars for service."}
{"text":"Great place great food, have eaten here many times and never been dissatisfied, great employees and appears to be family operated. If I could give more than 5 stars I would, they deserve it."}
{"text":"What a SPECTACULAR find!!! Not only was the Italian dishes authentic and scrumptious but the owner and all his sons were super friendly and warm and made us feel like family!!we came to Las Vegas because we were thrown out of Florida early, although we had planned a National Parks trip already to fly to Vegas..hurricane IRMA forced us out early. we found the place by accident and I cook Italian food from scratch at home and every dish we ate there was done perfectly. \"altente\"  just like we like on the pasta and they had Broccoli  Rabe and did it just perfectly WHAT A FIND!!!! We ended up eating there three times prior to our journey to the parks and came back and ended our trip going back to say goodbye as the guys hugged us. You walk up and order your food and then when you sit down, they bring it to you with a warm smile or chat. The bread was fantastic and they also have stuffed rigatoni!!! their sauce is delicious and pizza was out of this world!!! What a warm Italian kitchen feel...... thanks \"Dom\" and bros and family!!! We love ya!"}
{"text":"Great food. Donnie's Sub is my absolute favorite. The chicken parm sub is pretty amazing as well. Love the cannoli here as well. You also get a discount as a UNLV student!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty sweet. I got the pastrami on rye and whoa they pack that thing down with a ton of meat. Definitely a good deal. I also tried the cheese pizza. It very new york style; lots of grease, lots of cheese lol. All in all it was a great place to eat. Make sure you get there early cuz it gets packed."}
{"text":"Ever since Ciao Ciao on Durango closed I've been in search of a comparable clam pizza.  After reading some reviews from my fellow Yelpers I decided to give this place a try.  I have to admit, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and taste of the clam pizza.  I recommend the white sauce.  Also tried the standard cheese slices and they were great as well.  They also have a large selection of Italian deli products to go and a full menu of sandwiches."}
{"text":"I love this place, the marinated eggplant and mushrooms are delightful, I haven't try anything that is not worth coming back for! One of the best Italians in town."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this review all 5 stars cause the food was actually very good! But, we did get it delivered by BiteSquad. Although we did get it delivered when we received it, it was like someone dropped our pizza and was just like \"screw it\" and still have it to us!!   This was our first time ever trying this restaurants food. So it was very disappointing. My husband still ate the pizza he just rearranged the toppings. I also had the shrimp Alfredo. Which half of the shrimp in my entree weren't cooked all the way. I ended up picking out the rest of the shrimp and ate the pasta which was still good. But sadly the pizza incident just ruined it. Don't know if we will eat here again. If we do possibly not delivery cause they just may drop your pizza."}
{"text":"This Italian deli/restaurant always impresses me.  Reminds me of New York. Not fancy. Just really good food. Always. Nuff said!"}
{"text":"In the past I've stopped by here to get individual slices of pizza, unimpressed by the  quality. But today, I opted for the spaghetti and meatballs. They were delicious! I highly recommend this dish. Perfectly al dente, sweet and savory meatballs, perfectly flavored tomato sauce."}
{"text":"Items Selected: Garlic Knots Fried Gnocchi Neapolitan Rice Ball Margarita Sicilian - Fresh Mozzarella, Tomato Sauce, Fresh Basil White Pizza - Ricotta, Romano, Mozzarella, Italian Spices Ricotta Canolli  Located in a small complex just steps off the UNLV campus and part of my regular workday walking route Cugino's Italian Deli had long been on my \"to do\" list; a Saturday afternoon visit with two friends proving the rumors of pricy yet good East Coast Italian classics to be quite accurate.  Small in size and curt in customer service it was with admitted indecision that our group approached the Cugino's counter and ordering on-the-fly a six-part meal emerged, the $66 meal presented in four courses with plenty of leftovers and mostly impressive results.  Undoubtedly a red sauce joint despite a multitude of housemade salads and sandwiches it was with fried pillows of ricotta gnocchi that the meal began and with each creamy morsel crispy on the exterior but virtually oilless I was immediately impressed - a trend continued in the tender rice ball buried in house-pulled mozzarella and tangy marinara.  Obviously prone to over-ordering, particularly in small groups, our trio next doubled down on a pair of pies and while the thin white pie proved somewhat bland to my tastes with a mundane crust tinged with semolina the Sicilian dazzled as fresh mozzarella formed soft puddles amidst aromatic tomato sauce bright with acid and appropriately devoid of sugar.  Breezing through a plate of golden garlic knots aggressively seasoned with its namesake herb and kissed with butter before finishing the meal with pre-filled canolli already experiencing some sog it was with a bit of disappointment that I was informed neither house-made rainbow cookies nor tiramisu were available outside the freezer but with stomachs full and leftovers boxed as conversation flowed it would be hard to say I regretted much...except perhaps neglecting the tripe soup or eponymous Cugino's Special sandwich, both on the short 'there's always next time' list, though a repeat trek to similar-but-better Montesano's will most certainly come first."}
{"text":"Well that was the best garlic bread, salad, and spaghetti meatballs I've had in my entire life. Of you come to Las Vegas, and you love Italian food, you must go to this place. Top notch deli with an undeniable Sopranos feel."}
{"text":"They have the best pizza & sandwiches! Everything is homemade.. their cheese, bread, and even meats! I love this place (:"}
{"text":"Eggplant parm - to die for :) Hole in the wall, hard to find in the back of a shopping center, but worth finding. Great Italian food."}
{"text":"You have to try their rice balls. They are available in a vegetarian or carnivore option. I prefer the vegetarian. This is melt in your mouth deliciousness! The rice is mixed with mozzarella cheese, it is lightly friend and the insides either have meat or marinara and peas.  The sandwiches are always top notch. The pizza is always hot and fresh. Do yourself a favor, if you are near UNLV treat yourself to Cugino's and tell your friends.  The people that run this place are New York Italians. They are warm and friendly.  They also have a lot of hard to find Italian offerings. The best gnocchi you can find is sold there. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Have been a regular here since 2012. Every time I go in they know what I'm getting. Awesome family owned establishment."}
{"text":"Before there was Yelp, the reliance on word of mouth was prevalent. I must have talked to all the wrong people because four years of university and everyone I asked persuaded me not to step foot into this place. Now I know all of them were selfish bastards who are trying to keep this place all to themselves.   This Italian deli and restaurant is so diverse that even people with dietary restrictions would be able to dine with few problems. I met a friend after work for dinner. I wish I had taken some pictures, but I was ravenous by the time it all came out. The food appears at a slower pace at Cugino's. Do not write them off. It would be a major loss. We split everything to ensure a large variety. The Goodfella Sandwich is filled with grilled and marinated bell peppers, eggplants, and zucchini. These veggies absorb the aromatic balsamic vinegar well. Fresh mozzarella, lettuce, tomatoes, and onions also come on the crusty roll. I wish they had peppers spicier than a jalapeno or pepperoncini, but it was fantastic. The Garlic Knots and Linguini in Clam Sauce were great, but not as magnificent as the sandwich. We ended our meal with a cannoli. It was not blow your socks off, but anything would pale in comparison to the meal we just experienced.   Now I will go and spread the word of Cugino's like those before me should have. I will not selfishly cling to this shop. Instead, I want everyone to enjoy them as much as I did."}
{"text":"This a perfect neighborhood Deli, great food, real nice deli case and the staff make you feel like your eating at the kitchen table.  You need to try Cugino's next time you need a pizza pie or sandwiches!"}
{"text":"I just happened to be near the UNLV and stop by this Deli, what a FIND! The rice Neapolitan rice balls are Awesome. The stuffed cherry peppers are screaming good, marinated mushrooms & artichokes were great! The anti-pasta salad was to die for. I also took a pizza home, OMG it was Awesome! If you like garlic knots that have a strong garlic taste like they should in my mind you will love them! What a Great Find. I will be stopping back in and make the drive just to eat here! Everything I tried was Fresh Fresh, Fresh Great Food, Great Owners I will be back many times"}
{"text":"What can I say except \"BEST ITALIAN DELI ANYWHERE\"   My fiance and I are huge sandwich lovers...I am a huge Italian deli lover...it is hard to find one that deserves a 5 star rating but Cuginos 100% does. Not only is it the best sandwich, we get Italian #1 and #2 and share but the staff, who is all family...are AMAZINGLY wonderful people. It is a great place to enjoy the best sandwich and to be around a family that you can truly tell enjoy what they do.  They use boars head meats and cheeses for their sandwiches...the best bread, soft on the inside and harder on the outside, but not heavy like a lot of torpedo bread... and the cookies are yum yum yummy!  They also have a great selection of Italian groceries to purchase...so you can take it home and cook for yourself!  Thank you Cuginos for a great sandwich every single time we come!!"}
{"text":"I had the Rigatoni Bolognese and it was very good. The antipasto salad was not that great. Their Italian salad dressing tasted like it was from a pre made bottle."}
{"text":"Oh yeah this is a great Italian deli :)"}
{"text":"Visited Vegas last weekend and after going to the mob museum I had to get a hoagie somewhere.  This place hit the spot.  Very delicious and at a reasonable price.  Be sure to check this place out you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Yelp, I'd like to applaud you for not letting me down. I bow to each of you, fellow Yelpers, for you steered me right tonight.  You see, tonight I got home from work and was just too exhausted to do much of anything. So, I settled on delivery and headed over to Yelp to guide the way.   I ended up ordering a Sicilian Rice Ball, the Donnie's Special Sandwich, and the Garlic Knots.   Delivery: I ordered using the site Eat24, which was easy enough. Because of their handy dandy little timer, I was able to see that my delivery took about an hour and ten minutes. I'm right up the road, so I'm not sure if they were just busy tonight or what. I didn't really mind the wait, since I'm just lounging at home--- but if you are rushed, keep that time window in mind.  Let's start with the knots: they're delicious. Flakey on the inside, crisp on the outside. VERY garlicky (which is a huge plus in this Italian girl's world). I feel like they might be slightly improved with a little cheese or something, but I'm not mad at all. My order came with six knots and a thing of marinara--- which was actually a nice sauce, for the record.   The rice ball is. . . well, I don't totally know what I was expecting, but it's big (like, half a softball?). Cooked well, slightly crisp on the outside, mushy in all the best ways on the inside, good flavor.  The meat and pea situation in the middle is really great. Goes really well with the marinara.   The sandwich is the stand out though. Like, the sandwich will be the reason I'll order from here again, no doubt. The bread is flakey, the chicken is huge and cooked well, the peppers are flavorful but not overly sweet, the balsamic is just the right flavor. . . and the mozzarella? Amazing.   Actually, I was saving the other half of the sandwich for lunch tomorrow, but now I think I'm going to grab that other half. Thanks again, Yelpers!"}
{"text":"What a cool spot - which I would of NEVER found if it wasn't for Yelp.  Walking in it's hard to make out what this place is exactly. They have a makeshift market selling pasta, sauces and other staples on racks off to the left. On the right they have a deli/restaurant counter where you can order traditional Italian eats.  The folks here weren't the nicest....they just took orders, and didn't care to much to smile or make conversation. They were also in a bit of a fight with one of the tables - I made out that they were family and were arguing about something in the kitchen.....pretty unprofessional. But, on to the food.  I got the Italian sandwich. It comes with salami, mortadella and provolone cheese with a zesty dressing, some tomatoes and lettuce. Super fresh - and a pretty big portion. The wife got 2 slices of Sicilian pizza (along with a soda for just $6 - it was the special of the day!) Haven't had Sicilian pizza in a super long time and this was great. Thick, cheesy and the sauce was delicious. Great deal.  Overall it's a no thrills place to grab a bite. We came here straight from the airport, super hungry and left satisfied."}
{"text":"I used to think that I visit Las Vegas for the glitz, glamour and fun ... and while I'm here, I have to find places to eat.  Now, I will be coming to Las Vegas to eat at Cugino's Italian Deli ... and the rest of Las Vegas' attractions will have to wait.  Yes, it's that good.  If you're expecting a $$$$ experience you can take your butt to the strip. At Cugino's ... it's more like coming home and seeing the family.  It's comfortable and you feel like they've prepared the food how they'd serve it to their own family.  It's like sitting around the table at home.  The flavors here are authentic and the service is friendly.  You can tell by the number of locals that are clearly returning customers, that this place is doing everything right.  My wife and I ate here for dinner.  She's a big fan of thin crust cheese pizza and is very picky about it ... she ranks Cugino's among the best 5 she's ever had.  She says that the perfect cheese pizza must be perfectly balanced between crust, sauce and cheese and she found it delicious.  I couldn't make up my mind, so I had the #2 Italiano sandwich AND a Meatball Parm sandwich (granted, I only was able to eat half of each).  But, WOW!  I'm hooked.  The Papa Cugino came by to each table and gave each of us a sample of what seemed to be an egg, ham, and cheese bread cut like a biscotti.  I forgot to ask what this was, but it was delicious too!  In a town full of self-proclaimed \"best this\" and \"best that\" ... we found a place that doesn't have to toot it's own horn ... their customers keep coming back.  In my review book, that means a lot.  When I'm in town, Cugino's has my dedicated business for their excellent tasting food and the heart and soul they put into their business."}
{"text":"Excellent baked ziti, sandwiches and salid. Great find. The outside doesn't look like much but this place has excellent food. Well worth the drive."}
{"text":"Yep, a true east coast deli, great pizza, good sandwiches, fast service at a good price."}
{"text":"This place is wicked awesome!! I grew up in NY and the food is amazing and spot on if your looking for real NY Italian fare. My wife and I come there when we want great Italian food prepared from scratch and almost everything on their menu is made there from traditional family recipes. It's like a hidden jewel in the rough of crappy fake Italian restaurants here in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of home (Rochester, NY). I have been looking for a place that has a decent sub and I found it. The bread is amazing. The quality of the food is great. I will definitely be back. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem!! Seemingly I'm not the only one who highly recommends this Italian deli. We decided to stop here for lunch while at UNLV, and glad we chose this over the diner nearby. My very picky son decided to try and split a chicken Parm sub with me, and as we ate it I told him, this is about as good as you're gonna get. It was delicious, and so was the Pastrami that my wife got.   The feel is East Coast, and the food tastes like you want. Sauce, Roll, chicken was all the perfect sub. It was so good my son had to take one to go. UNLV should bring potential east coast students here to inspire their decision to come to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I was in Las Vegas for work and I wanted a quick take out Italian meal. I ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo and mozzarella sticks from the online option on Yelp. I arrived and picked up the food and noticed the shop was kind a cool \"old school Italian deli style\" The guy behind the counter was nice and gave me my food and I was off to the hotel.  When I opened the M.Sticks they appeared to be your garden variety frozen cheese sticks. I tasted them and confirmed there was nothing special here. The marinara sauce was tasty and really salvaged the cheese sticks for me.  Next I opened the Fettuccine Alfredo the portion was huge and it looked good but when I tasted it it had little or no flavor. It was like eating a frozen dinner. Fettuccine Alfredo is one of my guilty pleasures but this was not worth the calories.  Sorry I will not be going back here."}
{"text":"After being disappointed by online reviews we tried this place, it was very good, the prices are competitive, the place is clean and proportions are just right.  We had the meatball and the sausage sandwiches. The sausage was really good, the meatballs were ok, too much. The sauce was perfect, made with quality tomatoes, but on this sandwiches the cheese was king, just delicious; stringy and creamy.  Also got the 5lb can of Cento San Marzano Tomatoes for only $12.99. We'll be back. Grazie!"}
{"text":"WOW...this is the best place in town, I recommend and escort all my friends, family and acquaintances to this place...I can eat here all day and no heart burn, the best and freshest food in town, AS WELL AS THE FRIENDLIEST SERVICE AROUND....they actually care..... I travel all the way across town to eat here...YOU SHOULD TRY IT you won't be sorry!!!! Tell Freddy, Julia and the boys HI while you're there."}
{"text":"As a former New Yorker and an honorary Italian, this food is BOMB. Best Italian food in Vegas. Wish I could give it more than 5 stars!"}
{"text":"ONE OF THE BEST  ITALIAN SPOTS IN TOWN IF NOT THE BEST ?I'm originally from New York so I'm super picky with Italian food but if you want some good food come here ! I've dabbled around on the menu and I haven't been disappointed by anything yet ... I have yet to try the pasta and that's next on the list ! Also if you're dining in they have true authentic Italian snacks ,  pastas  and groceries available for purchase ... along with a deli ! I got some imported prosciutto that was super tasty . If you're a fan of Italian food , I suggest coming here or ordering from here"}
{"text":"I asked around who people thought had the best pizza, and this place was mentioned the most. I decided to order a pie for delivery. When the pie arrived, I immediately needed to have a look at the crust because it is crucial to good pizza. The crust is similar to a Brooklyn, New York style. Nice and crispy on the bottom with the remainder pleasantly chewy. The sauce wasn't lathered too think, nor was it too sweet or too tangy. When you have the opportunity, do yourself a favor and give this place a shot. You won't be disappointed. Excellent pizza!"}
{"text":"Oh my. This place is next level good. I've only had their sandwiches but that's because I can't get past them. The Italian 1 is the perfect italian sub. And dont let me get started on the pastrami melt...they stack it 2\" thick with cheese on both sides and mustard on marbled rye. Definitely up to snuff with a deli in NY."}
{"text":"Classic east coast Italian deli right down to the hanging meat and cheese (plastic for effect) and the friendly staff of few words. All family working, from photos on the wall. During peak times this place fills up fast, but they do a great job of keeping things moving. We got the Cugino's special pizza, held onion and peppers. It was great east coast style. Says the sausage was made in house?? It was link style, I prefer crumble, good but not great. My son got the regular slice of cheese, pretty large slices. The try highlight was the Rice Ball - deep fried full of mozzarella with an incredible side of marinara. It was a delight. Finished with the cannoli- it was ok.  Definitely give this place a try. Get off the strip and get some real reasonably priced Italian.  Also the sandos all looked fantastic. Next time !"}
{"text":"Fantastic pastrami melt, the pizza has a crispy crust and the slices are pretty big. The only thing that did not blow my socks off were the garlic knots.   If your looking for a good hole on the wall Italian joint then try this place out."}
{"text":"Found it on yelp was staying at a room near the area. And wanted pizza saw joes pizza but decided to give this a run.   Found out it was excellent and will forever go back.  Great place"}
{"text":"Such great, fast and authentic Italian food. The pizza is especially tasty; it reminds me of east coast pizza, yum! Also they offer UNLV student discount!"}
{"text":"A home away from home? Yup, that's exactly what this place is! You can buy home-made Italian food,  desserts, breads, meats, and much more!   I enjoyed the Chicken Parm Hot Sandwich and it was amazing! You could share it between two people. (I was only able to eat half). Chicken parmesan is a popular dish but this has to be hands down the best I've tasted.   For dessert I had a Cannoli, and the filling was finger licking good.   Everything was so fresh and truly makes you feel like your eating a home-made meal!   The location is hidden behind the Chipotle across from UNLV, so don't let the looks fool you!"}
{"text":"I'm staying at the Westgate Resort.  I researched pizza places that delivered to this hotel and this was one of several.  So I placed my order online, requesting delivery service.  Not having any doubt at all that the pizza would be delivered to my room.  I've stayed at hotels before and have never had a problem with deliveries to my room. So the delivery person called me about 20 min later saying she's leaving the restaurant now and I'll have to meet her at outside.  I'm at a hotel, thus the reason I ordered delivery.  I don't want to get dressed and wait for the elevator and go through the whole hotel to go outside and get my order and then carry my pizza plus two other full bags back through the hotel and wait in line for 10 minutes for the elevator and take it up to my room.  That is the whole point of delivery! And, I tipped!  I wouldn't have tipped had I known they weren't going to bring it up to my room! The delivery driver told me she couldn't bring it up to my room, hotel rules.  So I get presentable, go down 17 floors, find the guest services desk, ask them where the East entrance is, walk through the hotel to find the correct entrance, and go outside and get my pizza.  During the elevator ride up, there's a guy carrying a pizza.  I think, well he's smarter than I am, he probably just got pizza from inside the hotel and is taking it up to his room.  So imagine my surprise when I get off the elevator, and see that he gets off at my same floor, and walks down my same  hallway, and knocks on the door next to my room and hands off the pizza to my neighbors!  I asked him what delivery company he was from (Milano's) for future reference. To make it worse, there are no plates and napkins in my bags - I'm in a hotel! Do you think I have my own plates and napkins?!  AND, the pizza was supposed to have green bell peppers, but instead came with red.  I called the restaurant and asked to speak to a manager.  I was told the manager was not in and they didn't know when he/she would be available because they're very busy.   So, long story short, if you're staying at the Westgate in Vegas, or any hotel, make sure you confirm with the restaurant that they will be delivering to your room."}
{"text":"Dudes....the food was amazing.  I ordered through a delivery service so I could eat in my hotel room (harrahs)....we got a lot of food.  It was all very warm when we got it....garlic knots awesome....rice ball was friggin'great...the chicken wings were still warm and crispy (never occurs when I get takeout)...the chicken cheesesteak was meh...and the pizza was great.  All very flavorful.  I will be back next time I fly out."}
{"text":"As authentic as you can get. I travel a lot and the only other comparable Italian deli is Bay Cities in Santa Monica, california"}
{"text":"I was kind of nervous of bringing my sister who isn't such a foodie. The minute we stepped in she complimented how cool the place was. I was completely taken in by the scenery it's so lovely and quaint. As always we ordered a huge meal consisting of pineapple pepperoni pizza, penne pasta a la vodka, chicken wings, and seasoned fries. The salad and breadsticks that came with the pasta were a nice addition. The pasta was surprisingly delicious it was the best part of the meal. The pizza was pretty okay and the wings could have been better. The meal was pretty excellent regardless and I had an amazing time! I will definitely go again!!"}
{"text":"I heard alot of hype about this place from city life and from yelp and i went yesterday maybe i just expected too much from it going in. The place has lots of cool stuff to buy like frozen Gnocci, specialty breads sodas and oils.Sliced meats and cheeses.I orderd the chicken parm and my honey orderd the \"Dons special\" wich is chicken cutlet and peppers and fresh mozzarella.The chicken parm was just like any old chicken parm sandwich nothin special.Alittle soggy because we got it to go my BF DOn special was better because of the fresh cheese, but he scraped all the soggy lettuce off (again prob soggy cus we got it to go) I will go back because there are other things on the menu id like to try.I will make sure to review again hopefully it will be as good as everyone says."}
{"text":"Delicious chicken pizza w/ flavorful sauce. Wings were also good.   Service was not all that great."}
{"text":"Being Italian and from NY (and that's central NY, not the city) I am incredibly picky about my ingredients. I was disappointed for a long time with my options in Vegas until I was told to try Cugino's.   Holy Cannoli!  Thank god for Cugino's! I usually stock up every few weeks leaving with a large box of freshly made mozzarella, hot sausage, bread dough, sauce, Jamaica cakes, cavatelli, raviolis, and hot cherry peppers (which are hard to find).  Everyone is always friendly & helpful at this family run deli. They even carry my box of goodies to my car.   Eat in or take out options, Pizza is great too!"}
{"text":"Cugino's is a lot like a place that I visit back home in Austin in that it's an Italian market with various deli products and groceries as well as a counter with an Italian menu to order from.  Unlike the place in Austin, though, Cugino's is decidedly un-trendy.  It's in a strip shopping center near the UNLV campus.  And unlike other trendier options, Cugino's tends towards East Coast Italian-American dining as opposed to more \"authentic\" options.  I had a slice of their regular cheese pizza and a slice of their Sicilian thick crust.  Both were good, but the Sicilian stole the show, if for nothing else than the extra sauce.  It's a great option for a very quick lunch away from the tourist areas of Vegas -- and at a fair price."}
{"text":"This place is legit!!! My first time after hearing about it from friends.  I am definitely returning and OFTEN.  The flavor was intense for me and authentic.  I split some food with friends and had half of the pastrami sandwich and a slice of pizza which was very yummy! Of course, I couldn't leave without trying their spumoni which topped it all...bits of chocolate and pistachios mixed within the flavors. Prices were very reasonable. Wanting my next date night there :)"}
{"text":"Friendly place with awesome pizza. To bad they wont deliver to chicago - we'll definitely be back whenever were in town!"}
{"text":"Cugino's is a hidden gem in the middle of Las Vegas.  We've been coming here for just 2 years but we make it a point to try to stop here before leaving back to California.  The food is good and its cheap eats.  The restaurant is located in a strip mall, behind UNLV with a Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf and a Chipotle at the street front.  When you walk inside, the wall is decorated with photos of famous Italians, Italian food items are lined along the wall and shelves, and New York team logos are plastered throughout the store.  On this visit, we needed something quick before going to the KA show at the MGM.  Aside from hot and cold sandwiches, this place also serves pizza and pasta, and offers affordable daily specials which won't break the bank (and that's important in Las Vegas!).  We started off our dinner with their garlic cheese bread.  Its a simple starter with garlic and melted cheese on a thick Italian roll.  For our entrees Stephen and his dad ordered the spaghetti and meatball special, which came with 4 meatballs. Stephen's mom and I had the meatball Parmesan sandwich special. It was loaded with lots of cheese, and I could have easily shared one.  The portions are generous, and you won't leave hungry. Its a great place for a starving UNLV student. As I said, the place won't break the bank.  The total for all 4 of us came to $45 with tax, and we left in a food coma."}
{"text":"Went tonight for dinner.  Had the most amazing cheese pizza....crunchy on the bottom, hot gooey sauce, and the most amazing cheese!  Me n' the hubs both ate dinner for a whopping total of $10.80.  What a deal! You can't even eat dinner for that at McDonalds.   There were a lot of old folks in there and everybody was talking to each other (I guess they're regulars) and that's always a good sign.  I enjoyed it.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"What cha talkin bout??  This place rocks...I think family business or appears as such. Great food..they close too early but Hey not complaining.  I just need better time mgmt. haha  Yummy am headed that way today."}
{"text":"Cuginos is a great place to stop for some good italian food. I usually do just the Pizza slice combo which is two slices of pizza and drink for 5 bucks. The pizza is pretty spot on every time. I have had better in Vegas, but its right up there in my top 5 or so. They also make great salads and sandwiches. The staff is always friendly to us when we go in. If you go in, ask Donnie if you can try a piece of their fresh homemade mozzarella. Its the best Mozzarella i have honestly ever had."}
{"text":"We visited on our last trip and ordered the eggplant parmigiana sandwich, rice balls, and cannoli. It tasted as good as Brooklyn's Red Rose restaurant. We will definitely visit here often when we move to Las Vegas in a few months. Salute/cheers"}
{"text":"It was Saturday afternoon and I wanted to try something new. I am a sucker for sandwiches, so I settled on Cugino's after a quick search on Yelp. The first thing I noticed was the sticker on the door advertising Boar's heads meats and when we walked in they were speaking Italian, double win! This place is part deli, part Italian grocery store, and part restaurant. Although, I did find the plastic meats and cheeses hanging over the deli counter a bit tacky.   I was initially going to try their pizza, but it looked like it had been sitting all day. So after a quick look at the menu, we settled on the pastrami melt and spaghetti and meatballs. The pastrami sandwich was gigantic! It was also pretty delicious, although I am not sure I could eat a whole one simply because it was so rich. The pastrami, melted cheese, and secret sauce made the sandwich fantastic. I am not a huge fan of rye bread, but I did end up stealing half of the sandwich from my husband. The spaghetti and meatballs were good, nothing spectacular, but good. The sauce definitely made the dish, it was simple but also had a depth of flavor. The meatballs were good, but nothing special. The spaghetti was OK, but could have been better. There was little bread stick on the side and let me tell you it was fabulous. It was crispy on the outside but nice and soft on the inside. So delicious and unexpected! Overall, I would like to try more of what they offer, but I think that sandwiches are definitely the way to go here."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've ever eaten!! Family owned and very friendly. I was in a trip with extended family from Indonesia and the 2 teenagers practically bagged to come nback within 48 hrs. Their tomato and basil pizza was too die for."}
{"text":"Seriously, I see someone's Nonna in the kitchen. Authentic neighborhood deli like you'd find in NYC--only with full menu."}
{"text":"Molto bene!  Prego!  With overflowing gratitude to my co-worker and Yelp Lt. General Supreme Goddess Jaime who HIGHLY  encouraged I forgo a boring Subway lunch for something a little more exciting.  With only 30 minutes for lunch, a person has to really ponder the worthiness of the extra 3-4 miles each way.  In her most nonchalant way, she mentioned she loved her meatball sub SO MUCH that when she inadvertently dropped a meatball on the floor it was almost good enough to pick up and eat.  My kind of foodie!  The General also recommended I call ahead but I opted to use their online ordering service via  eat24.com.  (Cugino's has their own website, but when you want to pre-order to are redirected to a Cugino/eat24.com website.)  The online ordering process was a breeze.  I am a web guy and I really appreciate that.  The ONLY reason I only rated Cugino's with 4-stars was it was my understanding when I provided my CC to eat24.com I had already pre-paid for my food.  So, when I arrived to pick up my food I was surprised when the nice lady asked for my CC.  I understand now why they do it that way....If I actually never pick up my food, I could request my CC company nullify the charges.  Major props to Jaime as when I picked up my food at 12:05pm, there were at least 10-12 people in line.  So, I was able to smile and breeze right by.  The few times I get to feel superior in this world is when you order food correctly and leave the average joe's (hi Terri.....lol) in the dust.  Brought the food back to the office and I was not disappointed.  In fact, if I had dropped a meatball on the floor in our workplace kitchen, I WOULD HAVE PICKED IT UP and eaten it.  LOL  As you can tell my photo, the side salad was pretty huge.  A great lunch value for $11.  I would highly recommend this place, I would become Yelp friends with Jaime (cuz, she knows her stuff), and I would order ahead online."}
{"text":"This is a 'real deal' New York Italian deli. I simply love their Brooklyn pizza and eat it weekly. It was the lunch special that got me hooked on this place. The Reuben, Pastrami and Meatball Sandwiches are killer! I highly recommend this ma and pa shop!"}
{"text":"Excellent. It's an Italian deli, pizza, and grocery in one. The bread for sandwiches is fantastic and their pizza is just the style served in Rome (pan style pizza vs. thin neapolitan style for the uninitiated).  Great staff. Next to UNLV and relatively near the strip."}
{"text":"So happy we found this place. Real italian food at great prices. The rigatoni Bolognese is delicious."}
{"text":"What a find while on vacation. I found Cuginos on Yelp and we have been here 3 times already. We  will visit one more time before we depart.  This is very casual, home cooked dining at it's best. We love having a few good lunches away from the strip and tourist traps. Their Sicilian rice balls are the best you will ever have. They are moist, not greasy and filled with a delicious meat/ mozzarella  center. Their fried gnocchi are also worth a try along with the pasta fagioli soup.  They have many specials and offer eat in or take out. I learned that they are transplanted New Yorkers (Staten Island) which explains the familiarity we felt. Our frequent visits in such a short period of time speak for themselves.  Don't miss out."}
{"text":"This review is long over due, I came here last year during my 3 weeks vacation. This place is way overrated when I ordered my food the owner was non stop coughing. When I got my food the owner was still coughing all over my food. I ordered the following  Pepperoni Pizza 2/5 nothing special & nothing stood out  Chicken Parmesan Sandwhich 2/5 same thing here nothing stood out  Service 2/5 having the owner coughing when I got my food was not good  After I ate the food I too started coughing I don't know if it's the air or the owner coughing has to do with it. I don't know how this place got such high ratings I'd had better pizza & chicken parmesan else where. After my experience I would not be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Not very good. Heavy on salt. Not worth the price at all. Employees are also rude, they are unhelpful, and extremely sweaty. Also the area inside the restaurant seems dirty and dusty."}
{"text":"Got the white pizza, garlic knots, and a cannoli when I went here. The pizza was a thin crust and had amazing flavor. The garlic knots were not as big as I had hoped but I will say the flavor was spot on and the size of them actually worked out because I wasn't too full to eat my other things. The cannoli was delicious and was perfectly crunchy and not chewy. It was expensive but I would say it's worth it. If you want amazing pizza I would recommend this place. Also the shop has many authentic Italian goods to buy."}
{"text":"Great authentic Italian deli! I had the Cugino's special. It was a great sandwich. The rest of the party had the chicken parm sandwich and another the Italian. Wish I would have tried it earlier because of its proximity to UNLV, but will still go eventhough I am no longer a student. Can't go wrong with these authentic New Yorkers!"}
{"text":"Fresh  marinara sauce.  Best Meatball sub I have ever had.  Great authentic Italian restaurant.  Really good food."}
{"text":"Came here for husband's pizza craving.  We ordered the small eggplant pizza for him, which he liked enough that he inhaled the entire thing almost by himself.  I thought it was just fine.  It was my first time trying eggplant, and I didn't know what to expect.  I do not consider this NY style pizza.  Yeah the crust is thin, but it's almost got a cracker feel to it.  Better than Secret Pizza in the Cosmo.  Ingredient quality and freshness unquestionable.  I also ordered the garlic knot (nothing special), cheese arancini (nice to try, won't order again), and the fried ravioli (yes!).  I think I'll be coming back to try the pasta or a sandwich.    Overall, this place is reasonably priced and sells quality food.  I lurv Italian delis, and so wish we had one back home."}
{"text":"Lunch delivery emergency! Cugino's to the rescue. Phew!   This is a chicken parm sandwich that knows how to treat a lady RIGHT."}
{"text":"Cugino's is right across the street from my work and it is delicious! My friend and I went in for lunch today. I ordered the Cugino's Special Sandwich and it was delicious! The mozzarella was by far the best I've ever had. We also had the garlic knots and an order of fries. The place is pretty small so it gets packed during lunch time, but they take call ahead orders if you're short on time."}
{"text":"Born and raised in Brooklyn NY and this place is legit.  There were 5 of us and the food was impeccable.  It brought back memories from when I lived in Brooklyn.  The sauce was so good after I finished off a Chicken Parm.  dinner (which was delicious) I ate almost all the bread cleaning my plate.  I will be going back for more."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite pizza joints in Vegas! Perfect for the average college student, conveniently located across the street of UNLV with amazing (and decently priced!) food.   My two favorite things here are the cheese pizza and the ranch. The cheese pizza fulfills everything I want in a New York style pizza: pizza sauce perfectly seasoned, melted cheese that clings to the piece when you take a bite, and all on top of a thin crust with lots of grease (yes you read that right). The kind of pizza slice that you have to fold in half to eat.. That's my shit. As for the ranch, they charge 50 cents for a small side, but let me tell you, it's worth it. They put raw garlic in it, and I sure love me some garlic.   They have some pretty good specials too (my favorite go-to is the two slices of cheese pizza with a drink for $6.99) and their customer service is always super friendly.  I also gotta say I love the ambiance of this place, from the shelves stacked with Italian brands of pasta and tomato sauces to the walls covered with Italian or New York decor, and especially the family that runs the place.  I wouldn't recommend, however, the white sauce with pasta or the salad. The salad is bagged ice berg lettuce and bottled dressing. As for the white sauce, it tasted like a jar of Ragu alfredo sauce.  Just stick with the pizza, trust me on this."}
{"text":"Love this place and I can't find anything wrong with this classic Italian deli.  Counter service with a very expansive menu and a small store where one can purchase many Itallian goodies.  I've had several sandwiches and each is excellent.  I prefer the Itallian #2 when in the mood for a cold sandwich.  Pizza looks good and so does everything else.  Loved the Cannoli and the next time in I'm going for the stromboli.  Get your Italian deli fix here!"}
{"text":"Who thought a REAL NY joint could be found in Las Vegas. We did the buffets for a day or so and then we found this place. As a native NYer living in the SW I thought the good pizza, sausage, peppers  and onions and eggplant Parmesan was 3000 miles away...Wrong! They can be found right here. In a week we did everything on the menu and never looked back. Great food at less than casino prices. Try it, you'll like it."}
{"text":"Food was authentic as Italian food gets. Lots of meats and cheeses to create your own charcuterie plate. Pizza was delicious. Tiramisu was amarretto-y! :) spumoni had chucks of cherries and chocolate bits. Soo good. Found our Vegas Italian spot."}
{"text":"Came here last week and it was truly awesome! Had those garlic knots and never tasted anything remotely close to them, they were that great!   Enjoyed the atmosphere and ambiance, truly seemed like a neighborhood hangout!   Ordered a pizza, the one with six slices, and it was also great! Not my favorite but a close runner up! Had sausage and pepperoni on it and was very pleased!  Next time an in Vegas this will be on my short list."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy -- in fact, it's a small deli in a dark, sort of creepy strip mall -- but it's the real deal for East Coast-style pizza and sandwiches.  The Sicilian is the kind you find in New York/New Jersey and usually not too many other places, with a thick, crunchy crust and a particular flavor that nails the NY style.  And they have cannolis and other Italian treats, and the staff is friendly (they have the NY accents, but not the NY brusque manner).  There's no decor to speak of -- just New York stuff on the walls, unadorned Formica tables, a TV with a ball game on -- but the food's on target."}
{"text":"My new favorite Italian restaurant! Delicious!  We had the large pepperoni pizza the crust was crunchy very flavorful. Will be back soon!"}
