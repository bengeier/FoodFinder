{"text":"Yummy! Forgot that I was in the desert for a minute! Maine lobster roll was amazing...I'm a RI girl, and usually don't order lobster unless I'm back east...but, I definitely recommend visiting the Maine Lobster Lady."}
{"text":"Being from Cape Cod I really appreciate  honest seafood. This is by far the best you can get west of the Boston. Keep cooking them lite. Thanks Jacque and Larry"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this every year at the Scottsdale Arts Festival and in 2015 I decided to brave the line and try it.  I was astonished at the price, $18.00 for a sandwich?  I told myself, ok, it is lobster and you have always wanted to try it.  The line was long but the sandwich came out quick.  So not worth it for me.  Although, the roll was fresh, the lobster, was flavorless, the portion small, even with a pickle and chips, $20.00 was to much to pay.   Never again for me!"}
{"text":"With apologies to Air Supply.  \"You are my lady And I am your man Whenever I reach for you, you do all that you can Are you ready to learn the power of love?\"  There isn't much more that I can add to the other reviews. Fantastic food and even better service.  If you're out and you see this food truck, I don't care if you're hungry or not - get a lobster roll. If you don't, the missed opportunity will haunt you for the rest of your life; it'll be like that time you chickened out asking the pretty blonde to the prom.    But, don't take my word and the gazillion other reviewers word for the fantasticness (no that's not a word) of this food truck.  The Arizona Restaurant Association recently gave The Maine Lobster Lady a Foodist Award for Outstanding Food Truck."}
{"text":"Good but not great for the price. The food tasted good , however the traditional is cold. I'd prefer the hot butter one. However , the amount of food versus 20 dollars means I  probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I think Diane and her daughter are absolutely the bees knees!  Along with her magnificent significant other who catches the delicious crustaceans my husband and I just can't get enough of.  When we moved here from Boston over a decade ago we forgot the trade off for beautiful weather was the truly awful selection of good seafood. Especially his beloved lobster! Red Lobster was not an option because I would rather go without than to eat that lousy frozen crap. Our savior for a short time was when we found Foster's on 90th in Scottsdale. They had all their seafood food flown in from Boston and Maine with Fenway Franks in real New England style buttered hot dog rolls! Sadly they went by the wayside some years ago and we were again deprived of our beloved lobster, haddock & clams again short of flying home. Then a few years back  while I was in the hospital for quite some time I discovered this wonderful truck on my many long hours on the Internet. I sent my husband (big mistake) to go check her out and he came back with almost her whole menu! I hit the roof when I found out what he spent but after I tasted everything and the morphine kicked in I calmed down a bit I have been following her truck ever since as soon as she comes into town. I am addicted to her haddock sandwiches and clam rolls. They taste just like home. I have asked her to name her price on her hot dog  roll suppliers but she refuses to give up her source so I have to rely on friends and family to mail them to me my husband always get the Connecticut style lobster rolls and if you are a real lobster lover that is the only way so you can truly enjoy the sweet succulent taste with butter and not covered up by a bunch of mayonnaise and junk that just smother something so wonderful. If you have every lived or been to New England you know that her prices are fair especially getting something so wonderful in the desert. I was really happy when the scallops where added too. I now have a plan of attack and know when she will be close to me to get there extra early as her truck will always have the longest line every time. She is not part of a chain or a franchise. It is her and her hard working family that bring those  delectable delicacies right from the ocean to our desert oasis. I have never met a true east coast sea food lover that did not love her and her truck of yum but if you are trying lobster for the first time and it is not your cup of tea try something else and then something else because I guarantee there is something you will love or you must just be a landlocked beef eater and shouldn't be taken up a space in line anyway LOL"}
{"text":"OMG! So worth the wait for her delicious lobster roll!  Finally got a chance to visit her truck out at the Food Truck Festival at the Olive Mill in Queen Creek.  Make sure you check her website for her March schedule."}
{"text":"I am an official Maine Lobster Lady food truck stalker! The rolls are on point - stuffed with the freshest lobster this state has ever seen and heaped on an authentic top-split bun. There are many choices from lobster bites (think crab cakes but with lobster) to whole belly clam roll and everything in between. The blueberry lemonade is perfect too! Not too sweet and just enough pucker! Diana has just added a couple of specials, one of which I tried last night. The biscuits and gravy (lobster, of course- think bisque) was heaped with fresh lobster and was absolutely divine. Heavenly! Despite a sometimes lengthy line, the wait is well worth it!"}
{"text":"Wow! This lady must think people poop money! So expensive for what you get. You basically get a hot dog bun sized roll. We ordered one lobster roll with the butter sauce and one with the mayo sauce. Don't get me wrong they weren't to bad tasting but after about 3 or 4 bites our rolls were gone but our hunger was not. Way to expensive for a light snack. My wife is from a land locked state (Montana) and has no experience with \"proper\" seafood fare yet she makes a much better and tastier lobster roll with frozen lobster from the grocery store."}
{"text":"Let's start by pointing out that, the \"butter grilled roll\" that my most recent Maine Lobster Lady  visit served, was nothing but a grocery store generic hot dog bun. Really. On the website, it also shows a * indicating that the standard, $19 roll, includes blueberry coleslaw. Apparently, that is not always the case, we were given a cheap bag of chips, no slaw.  We have dined at her truck twice, in the Scottsdale area. The one star we are giving is because the truck looks cool. Otherwise, don't bother."}
{"text":"We had just hiked miles through Acadia  National park on Isle au Haut.  Three of us had been stung by wasps or bees!  The kids took a ride to town with someone in a truck, but my friend and I walked.  On the side of the road was a food truck.  We treated ourselves to a lobster roll. There must have been an entire lobster in each one! The pieces  of lobster meat were large and the salad made with subtle lemony mayonnaise, and a lemon wedge on the top. The role was lightly grilled and buttery. It was the most delicious lobster roll I have ever eaten and I spend ever summer in Maine.  The setting was perfect with Adirondack chairs under a shady tree. The blueberry lemonade was ideal to wash it down. I wish I had had room for the strawberry rhubarb ice cream!   Do not miss this stop!"}
{"text":"Waited with much anticipation for eating a lobster roll from this food truck after numerous friends recommended their food.  I was able to catch them in Mesa and both my wife and I came away disappointed.  Our traditional lobster rolls were not good at all and the lobster bisque was good (I've had better).  The meat itself was rather bland, not sweet as we expected Maine lobster meat to taste in our past experiences!  Not to mention, that the food is expensive and I would have to say overpriced.  Maybe they experienced a bad day, but I couldn't recommend their food to friends."}
{"text":"Love doesn't describe it.  Legitimate Maine lobster, and they don't forget the pup either :)"}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to sample this mythical food truck at the Food Truck Caravan in Scottsdale and the legend lives up to the hype...mostly.    I have to imagine that the other vendors get a bit despondent when this truck shows up at an event.  She draws a crowd!  Wherever this truck is going to be, get there right when the event starts.  The line fills up fast and while the truck's staff is very efficient at keeping the line moving, the wait can be a half hour or more.   I ordered the $18.00 Connecticut lobster roll, which consisted of succulent warm lobster meat drizzled with butter and nestled in a pillowy soft toasted bun.  The meat was sweet and tender.  The portion was generous but the roll was so good, I wanted more!  The price included a pickle spear and a bag of chips.  I also ordered the blueberry lemonade ($3.00).  Fresh squeezed with a perfect sour/sweet combination.  The only disappointment was the seafood chowder.  The broth had good flavor to it but that's about all it was...broth.  There were a few flecks of corn and a couple chunks of potato but I swear there was no seafood or fish in my portion at all.  I do know that I got the last portion of that particular pot, because I saw them replacing the pot after my order was plated.  My suggestion would be that when they get to the bottom of one pot, they make sure that the last couple portions have some meat in them.  While the creamy broth was good, it was no value without any seafood in it at $9.00 for a small bowl.  But that won't stop me from giving them another try!  Service was friendly and I can't wait to try some of the other delectables on their menu!"}
{"text":"As a person who barely writes yelp reviews, I felt compelled to write one today after my experience at the Maine Lobster Lady food truck. I'm a Massachusetts transplant who's been living in Arizona deprived of delicious New England seafood for the last  7 years. Today that all changed! This is the real deal people. Wicked good stuff. Big delicious lobstah rolls and fried clams! The real ones. With the bellies. If you're like me and dying for a taste of home track them down. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"When I moved to Arizona from Maine a few years back, I thought my seafood days were over... That is until I found, The Maine Lobster Lady!! I have tried both of her lobster rolls and they are delicious!! Well worth the price!! The meat is fresh and plentiful! It tastes just like a quality lobster roll I would buy back home! I can not wait to try the other \"Maine Eats\", on the menu!! The food truck is darling as well, an over all great experience!!"}
{"text":"Nomnomnom!! Wow!!  I've been really wanting to eat at this food truck for a while now. I came to the food truck festival today and completely forgot that it was going to be there. The line was huge but was worth the wait. I've only had real Maine lobstah a few times before which is always a treat, but I've never had a Lobstah Roll before. It was really good. I was picturing an overwhelming amount of mayo added but this Lobstah Roll was more about the meat than anything. Very lightly tossed with mayo and the added lemon made for a great taste. I nice buttery toasted roll grilled on both sides just added to the perfection of this masterpiece. The price is expensive, but for the best quality in meat is worth the cost. I will definitely be craving another one here very soon."}
{"text":"Sounds real good. But you guys need some INFO on Price. You can easily pay this price or close to it, where lobsters are actually caught, Maine. It takes a lot to bring fresh seafood to the desert. So If this one is smaller, don't quibble. It has to cost money.  Now I have to actually find this lobster lady and have one of those sandwiches.  They wouldn't let me post it without the stars so giving her a rave review. Sounds like she deserves it."}
{"text":"Yum!!! The Lobster Lady is the BEST!   She gives you a HUGE portion of fresh tasty lobster! The lobster rolls are my favorite, but even the lobster salad was wonderful!   The other things on the menu are good too! My favorite of which are the fried clams.   I am definitely going to be following the Lobster Lady around this year until she leaves!"}
{"text":"Wow! Have owned a home in Maine since 85 and who knew that the best lobster roll I've ever had would be from this wonderful woman in Arizona. That's right, move over Reds Eats, Millers and Watermans! She uses all fresh. Clean lobster in a perfectly buttered and toasted roll. I went back for a second roll immediately just to be sure it wasn't a fluke. No fewer that seven whole claws per roll as well as other claw and tail meat and thank gosh it wasn't loaded with mayo. Even the lemon slice was fresh and juicy! Cole Slaw on the side was very good, little too much mayo for me but very fresh.  Well done and you're crazy to pass this up if she's around your area. Saw her at the Tempe Art Fair. This is the way a food truck should be done!  Aaaaaayup.....outstanding!!! Thanks and will track you down again this winter for sure."}
{"text":"I died went to HEAVEN on the 1st bite of my Lobstah Roll this past weekend in Phoenix, AZ.  \"Truely out-of-this-world.\"  You owe it to yourself to see if you can catch her at a Festival or event near you!!!!"}
{"text":"Another native New Englander chiming in with a RAVE review of this phenomenal food truck! I don't know of anywhere else in Phoenix (or in Arizona, for that matter) where you can get a real-deal lobster roll--and these lobster rolls are fantastic. They are *loaded* with lobster meat (with huge chunks of claw in there, too)--you are definitely getting bang for your buck in terms of the quantity and quality of what you are served. The fish sandwiches are top notch, too, as is the chowder, the lobster mac and cheese, the shrimp puffs, the blueberry lemonade...well, everything. Hunt down this food truck and gorge yourself silly--you will not be sorry!"}
{"text":"Today my wife and I purposely went to the Olive Mill to get Thee Traditional Lobster Sandwich. With a tip, a bottle of water and 2 sandwiches, 2 bag of chips, 48 bucks! What? You get some lobster stuck in a hot dog bun with a ' sauce'. No imagination or creativity. Total disappointment. Save your money.Go out to eat for that price. Thinking it must be a big sandwich? NOT!  Oh! You do get some kinda 1,oz serving of,  slaw??"}
{"text":"Thank you thank you for bringing the goodness of Maine lobster to Phoenix. The hot buttered lobster roll is amazing. I love it so much. For a food truck, they have many choices for a menu. The food is really good and the staff is very friendly too. Definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"What a let down after all the hype,the hour wait in line the hour drive to get there.( Queen Creek olive mill) 1-28-15. This tiny sandwich would still been a rip off at half the price. $18.00 for a sanwich,WOW.  Try red lobster and get a real meal."}
{"text":"The lobster roll is the bomb! They're small, but the bread is very good---lightly toasted, with WARM tender chunks of lobster that melts in your mouth. Note: Lobster is best served warm because it becomes chewy when it's cold. If you're looking for heavy mayo and celery chunks, this roll isn't for you. If you're looking for bite after bite of \"lobstah\"heaven, this roll has got your name on it!    My only critique is the size of the roll doesn't fill you up and it's pricey, $18. I would need to eat 2 to get my fill, but $36 is a bit hefty for lunch. This is definitely a special occasional treat!  Follow the food truck on Facebook. I found them parked in front of the Capitol building on a food truck Friday."}
{"text":"Thank goodness she's back!!  Yes, the Lobster is pricey.  But where else can you get Lobster like this in AZ?  The Lobster comes from a boat in Maine too (I got the back story from a friend of mine).  I still have yet to try the Lobster Mac and Cheese.  I usually get in line for some, and then at the last second change it to the Lobster Roll....yet again.  :)  Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"I finally caught up with her at her last weekend in Phoenix about a month ago.  This is the real deal for all of us New England transplants looking for authentic seafood...lobster rolls, fried clams with bellies, chowdah, and a variety of other delicious options.  I will be following her religiously when she comes back next season."}
{"text":"Decided to stop by here on my boyfriend and my weekend trip from California. The Connecticut lobster roll was amazing (highly recommend) however the lobster mac n cheese & the lobster bisque were very disappointing (which is why the 4 stars). Other than that, great roll & service!"}
{"text":"So overall I thought things were good. Lets start with the lobster roll.  I got the buttered, but didn't try the traditional, which is cold with some Mayonnaise.  The roll was good and good sized, and it comes with a bag of chips, a lemon slice and maybe a tablespoon of blueberry coleslaw.  For $19, I think they couldn't have given out two tablespoons of coleslaw  at least.    Next was lobster bisque for $9.  This was a big letdown.  It did have bisque, but if there was any lobster in there, I never found it. This was definitely the worst lobster bisque I've had.  Maybe more like lobster broth thickened with lots of flour. This was the only soup choice that day.  Next for a different meal had the haddock sandwich. It was pretty good, same tablespoon of coleslaw.  Which certainly O.K. was it worth $12? Not in my book. From a food truck this should be $8 or less.  So overall, get the lobster roll for a spurge, but don't bother with most of the extras. Just not worth it."}
{"text":"I've been eyeing The Maine Lobster Lady's food truck for over a year now. They're not around all the time, so I figured when I saw them at the Tempe Arts Festival I'd give them a try. From seeing the line I could tell they were popular, but they were also slowly running out some of their menu items, specifically the Lobster Bisque & Lobster Balls which I figured was a good sign.  I decided on ordering the Hot Buttered Lobster Roll which came with a side of chips. For $20+ after tax, I was really hoping it would blow me away. Unfortunately, it did not. The lobster itself was cooked well & tasted good, however I couldn't justify the price. I had seen photos posted on Yelp of a small side with the roll (in addition to the chips), but mine didn't come with anything. I'll say that if you're willing to pay the price then you'll get a good treat. This isn't a food truck that I plan on frequenting, but it's a good Lobster Roll!"}
{"text":"Every year my son and I look forward to her return to the valley. The lobster is so fresh and delicious you'd almost swear it came right off the boat."}
{"text":"First time I tired to go to the food truck was at the Food truck fest at talking stick couple months back. Line was stupid long so went to another truck that day. Way too hungry to wait 2 hours in line!   found them this weekend at the Scottsdale Art walk.  I was parked close to them and line wasn't too bad so I was in luck.  I tried the Main Lobster roll.  It was really good! big chunks of lobster lightly mayo'd with a wedge of lemon to go with it.  Bread was very good as well.  The roll was a little smaller than I had anticipated.  At $18 bucks for a roll and $3 for a lemonade, it is on the pricey side for a food truck.  Yes, I know it's lobster, but still.  I'm pretty sure I'd go back and try the Connecticut style next time.  Overall, great find and good job to them for bringing this to AZ and hopefully doing quite well and stay around a while."}
{"text":"I had a Connecticut Style Lobster Roll and it was worth every penny. So amazingly good. I will definitely be coming back just for another lobster roll. Service was great as well. The truck also looks so authentic!"}
{"text":"Good new, bad news! I was so excited when I received a post this morning on Facebook that The Maine Lobster Lady food truck was going at Mercedes-Benz at Arrowhead. Bad news, I was going to be in Tempe, and they would be done at 2 pm. So after my appointment, I raced across town, 48 minutes to stand in line. Fortunately, there was only one person in front of me. I almost missed the Lobster Bisque. Chef called out 2 more servings of Lobster Bisque after I received my bowl. Having seen so many pictures of the Lobster Roll, I have been having dreams about it. I finally got my Lobster Roll.  By the way, their truck is decorated super cute. Their signage for their menus is fun. It was super hard to choose what to order because everything sounded delicious. Also, the smells wafting from the truck were hypnotic. I was full of indecision and begged for recommendations.  So, this is my skinny on the nosh.  Lobster Bisque ($9): I wish I could remember how many ounces was the serving. It was smooth and creamy. The stock was rich with lobster flavors. I wonder if she uses the shells and heads for stock. My guess is YES! It had small bits of lobster meat in it, but it had just the right amount of sherry cooked in it to balance the strength of the stock. It could have been a tad bit thicker for me, but that is personal preference. The bisque came with oyster crackers.  The Traditional Lobster Roll ($19.99): The buttered and toasted roll was a delightful bed for the mound of lobster meat. I loved the fact that they don't chop up the delicately cooked lobster flesh, lightly buttered. Squeeze the lemon, the sour offsets the richness of the sweet meat and the butter. The Cole slaw was well developed, creamy and zesty with floral notes. The slaw was one of the highlights of my meal.  As far as prepared lobster goes, this experiences probably ranks pretty high. However, it was hard for me to part with $35 for a soup and sandwich meal. I came to a self-realization that when I think about lobster, I really crave eating the whole animal, sucking on the shells and squeezing every bit of meat and juice that I can. I love steamed lobster sans butter or any other flavor additives. I will also happily eat them sashimi style.   So, if you love fresh, carefully sourced prepared Maine lobster, and you don't mind dropping $30+ for a delicious soup and sandwich, then I will highly recommend The Maine Lobster Lady food truck. I have no regrets chasing after this fabulous food truck today, but it will take some time before my wallet makes a recovery."}
{"text":"Delicious. Crispy roll, tender lobster, creamy bite all rolled into one! Read my full Review at paleandpink*com!"}
{"text":"The line here is long, but it's totally worth it!  They stuff that sucker full of lobster, so much it's falling off the roll!  Not bad considering that $18 price tag.  The Maine Lobster lady is also actually from Maine too, so it's just as authentic as I'm told they actually ship all the ingredients from Maine.  The lobster Mac and Cheese was sold out by 8 PM.  It was a 45 minute wait to order the food and another 15 minutes before it was received, but the line speaks for itself.  Credit cards are accepted."}
{"text":"I am from New England. Salisbury, MA - Seabrook, NH line to be exact. Grew up with the BEST seafood in all the world. Since I left 23 years ago, I have yet to find anything remotely close. I live in Phoenix, AZ now, and am the furthest from any quality NE Seafood.   I was at an art show in Carefree, AZ when I noticed a sign for Maine Lobster Rolls. I had to check it out. I could not believe my eyes when I seen the food truck. I swear I just about melted with WHOLE BELLY CLAM ROLLS !!! She has it all...I ordered the clam roll and my wife ordered the Haddock Fish Sandwich. I was time lapsed back to my home land in a matter of seconds. Cheers to the Maine Lobster Lady for bringing the best food EVA out of New England."}
{"text":"The cold lobster roll is pretty good for the price. It comes with a bag of chips and coleslaw."}
{"text":"Well... LOBSTER ROLL: We were disappointed to say the least. During TV 3 News live review of The Maine Lobster Lady, she prepared her famous $18 lobster roll. The roll was huge with a BIG scoop of lobster meat. Today at 11:00am we tried her famous roll and were very disappointed to find it was a bait and switch. Meaning, the lobster roll they served us was a very small sub-roll with a small amount of lobster meat and bland. Not worth $18 LOBSTER BISQUE: Way too salty and tasted a bit old! Not worth $12 OVERALL: A big letdown, we'll stick with Pappadeaux."}
{"text":"I can't speak for the lobster entrees since they were sold out, but the lobster bisque is over salted, fishy and over priced. $9 for a cup (8 oz) of mediocre soup. The fried haddock was served on a doughy 10 cent bun slathered in mayo. Not worth $12."}
{"text":"When you are about to get good lobster anywhere, you expect two things: it will be a gustatory treat, and it's going to be pricey. And that's pretty much my experience of their hot buttered lobster roll. It was so good - the lobster meat came in big, sweet, juicy chunks drizzled with warm butter and further enhanced with a squeeze of lemon. I chose the warm buttered roll because I've tried - and liked - the classic cold w/ mayo version before in P-town and wanted to see how the buttered \"Connecticut style\" version was different... and it's definitely a winner. Service was really friendly, and I love that their truck has touches reminiscent of a classic New England beach-shack."}
{"text":"Diana Santospago is one popular lady in the valley.  I've seen her food truck pop up around my neighborhood from time to time.  And every time I see it, there's a line.  Tonight I happened to be at the Downtown Phoenix Public Market and her truck was parked right in front of my eyes with only two people in line.  I had planned on just getting dinner at home, but hey, opportunity knocks.  Bear in mind that this is legit Maine lobster, so it doesn't come cheap. Their lobster rolls run just shy of $20 each.  Being that this is Maine Lobster Lady, I figured a traditional Maine lobster roll is just what the doctor ordered.  You get a small bag of potato chips to go with it.  I also got some of their homemade blueberry lemonade and one of their small homemade whoopee pies for dessert.  Total cost for whole thing including tax was about $28.  They had my lobster roll out about 5 minutes after I ordered.  First impressions, the lobster roll itself isn't that big, but they overstuff that roll with plenty of the good stuff.  They put just a hint of lemon aioli on the meat, but otherwise they just let the lobster itself do the talking.  My first bite was a little unfortunate as my teeth crunched down on a piece of claw along with the meat.  Fortunately that was the only mishap, but I bit carefully from then on.  The good news is, the lobster is phenomenal.  Impossible to contain in that tiny roll, but plenty of big chunks of rich delicious crustacean.  The whoopee pie was pretty good as well.  Nothing out of this world, but basically a soft cake sandwich.  Vanilla cream filling in the middle bookended by a pair of light fluffy chocolate cake pieces.  And the blueberry lemonade was a great way to wash it all down.  So my experience here wasn't perfect this go around, but its easy to understand why this food truck garners such a following.  If you love lobster (particularly the good stuff from New England), you'll go nuts for Diana's.  They also serve lobster mac and cheese, lobster bisque, and even seafood chowder.  I'll likely dive into one of those next time I see the truck.  That is, of course, if I can beat the crowds."}
{"text":"I've had the lobster rolls twice now (traditional style) and learned after the first time to bring a little mayo with me to add to the lobster. Maybe the part of Maine I frequented uses more mayo (and usually a bit of celery) in their lobster rolls, but I need the mayo to bring out the lobster taste. Yes, $18 is a lot for a sandwich, but you won't find fresher lobster unless you cook it yourself and even then who knows how long those lobsters have been swimming in the Safeway tank? I also enjoyed the blueberry lemonade - a nice change from iced tea or soda. One day I'll try the mac and cheese or lobster bisque!"}
{"text":"Sorry, not a fan. The best thing I ate this night was at Old Dixie's THE BEST FRIED CHICKEN. $17 for lobster roll and it just wasn't all that."}
{"text":"Over priced, soggy bun... flavorless lobster. I got the buttered lobster roll... the only flavor to it was the over salted butter."}
{"text":"The best!! Nothing better. This is the number one reason we go to Barrett Jackson!! Unbelievably tasty."}
{"text":"Have you ever had food so good, that you meet people?   Like you're all under that canopy and eating and raving and talking like, you meet people:   \"Haa, I know right, this fuckin' amaze-balls. Yesh! Hi, I'm Gris, this is my wife. Oh you got the chowdah & sandwich, yeah we're fat kids too.\"  Like, you literally meet people.   That's how good the Lobster Lady is.   Like, when I'm out eating, people constantly ask me what I ordered. I don't like telling them, I like sharing bites ( really, if you see me, I will try to feed you ) That's the only way to know, right.    Like I can tell you it's good all day, but really you need me to put it In your mouth.   That came out wrong.   Anyway, go, eat here. Chat them up, they're delicious and super friendly. And they brought Maine'ish weather with them!  What's not to like.   Thank you Lobster Lady."}
{"text":"FINALLY!  I hope they add some more venues!  I caught them at a lil bar in Old Town.  Hardly any wait!  I got the traditional (cold) lobster roll and some lobster mac and cheese.  The bread is awesome - kinda sweet and buttered and toasted just right.  The sandwich was stuffed with lobster, not too much mayo.  It is kind of small for $18, but I'm glad it wasn't a disappointment after years of hype!  The mac and cheese was a little disappointing..  The pasta is way overcooked so its really mushy.  The cheese sauce isn't bad and I enjoyed the lobster flavor well incorporated into the dish.  Others felt it was a bit \"fishy\".    We also tried a homemade whoopie pie which I didn't really like at all..  It kinda tastes like warm cookies that resemble ice cream sandwich ones with marshmallow fluff in the middle instead of ice cream.    All in all, I'll probably stick to the lobster rolls!  Maybe have the clams.  :)"}
{"text":"I've tried to patronize The Maine Lobster Lady (TMLL) since Foodie Fest in Las Vegas two or three years ago; alas patience is not my virtue, so the 1-2 hour lines kept me from the opportunity. Living in Arizona now, TMLL was on my radar because the truck and crew winter here.   Due to a recent family tragedy, I haven't been much into Yelping, dining out, etc. Scott has done everything but stand on his head to try to cheer me up, when he called today and said \"I think I found your Lobster Lady in the car park at the Sheraton\" I was sure he was mistaken. Lo and behold, he was right! Diana and crew were indeed in the 'Tuk for a women's business expo, and I was in for a treat which made me happy, sated, and a total fangirl.   We shared the warm (CT style) Lobster Roll overflowing with claw meat, and lots of large pieces of tender lobster dressed only in butter, on a buttery toasted roll. It was worth waiting for! We also shared the Whole Belly Clam Roll, again a large portion, literally overflowing the delicious roll, not a hint of grease in the fried, succulent bivalves. Finally, we shared the Lobster Bisque: creamy with a hint of sherry, and plenty of lobster meat. The rolls ($19+ tax) come with a zesty blueberry slaw, and a bag of chips; the delightful bisque ($9+ tax) has oyster crackers on the side to add some crunch. It was a meal which put a smile on my face and a longing in my heart for my childhood home in NY, and summer spots in Montauk and on Martha's Vineyard.   Diana was so kind to Scott when she noticed he wears a LifeVest (external defibrillator) and wished him well in his quest for a heart transplant. Yesterday I would have sworn that nothing could put a smile on my face, and TMLL did just that and more. We will definitely visit them again. Lovely people making delicious food. As good as it gets for us!   * See their schedule on their website, FB, and Twitter *  ** Large menu (see photos) including sweets: homemade Whoopie Pies! **  *** Diana works with her husband on their Lobster boat in Maine in the summer/early fall. They KNOW lobster! ***  **** superb customer service ****  ***** they make dog treats, too :) *****"}
{"text":"Sadly, AZ hasn't been the hot spot for lobster rolls for a long...well okay, never. Who am I kidding? There are no lobsters in AZ! I am a crazed lobster addict, the Maine lobster lady is only in town during the fall and winter months, but oh my goodness, track her down! I get mine with melted butter and a lemonade. $20 well spent."}
{"text":"I searched far and wide for food reminiscent of New England and this was everything I dreamed of. I literally stalked this truck down just to try a little bit of everything!  First off, all the food that is served is fresh and caught in Maine from someone the owner knows. She has it sent here and serves it throughout the valley during the spring months. The reason she always has a line, is because it's...that...good!!  Make sure you get there early or your favorites may be gone. First off, my favorite was the Haddock sandwich. It's great for the money and you will never find Haddock anywhere in Arizona, trust me! It was lightly fried to perfection and the aoli tartar they serve with it is perfection. The lobstah rolls are scrumptious and are absolutely worth the price! I love every single chowdah and lobster bisque offering they have. Every bite came filled with tons of hardy seafood or vegetables. Plus she doesn't mix flour into the chowdah to thicken it like so many restaurants do to cut costs and quality. The prices are high but you always pay this much for seafood, trust me, I grew up on the beach!  Let's not forget a typical New England staple...the whoopie pie!! It...is...perfect. The chocolate cake is full yet light while the filling is thick and creamy like a typical whoopie pie. My favorite foods from home have been brought to the valley and honestly I wouldn't have it any other way!   Thank you Main Lobster Lady!! You helped to cure my homesickness and brought some amazing food up to bat! Now go stalk her truck already, you won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"OHHHH...MMMMM...GEEE! Our warm lobster roll on a grilled buttered bun was amazing! The lobster meat was sweet and tender and piled high on our bun! Their staff was wonderful! We enjoyed this seafood treat at the Tempe Festival of the Arts!! We also got the peppermint whoopie pie which was so delicious! This special treat is well worth it!!! Indulge yourself...it will make you very happy :)"}
{"text":"The truck is close to our office yesterday so my colleague made sure she informed me the day before about it to put in my order and then she went and got our orders from the truck.   We both ordered the Maine lobster roll, hot buttered which is pretty expensive ($19!) and my colleague ordered a Lobster biscuit and gravy as well, which is available occasionally and was available yesterday ($19 too). I wanted to get the blueberry lemonade as well but they were already out by the time my colleague ordered. The meals came with chips and coleslaw and a lemon wedge.   I took my first bite of the roll. OMG! I have never tasted better lobster in my entire life!! It was so fresh and so tasty, it was absolutely delicious!! Then my colleague asked me to try the biscuit and gravy dish. I don't know what to say but this blew my mind! I don't think I have ever had a better seafood meal ever! The coleslaw was fresh and crisp and had a great flavor, very suitable with the meal.   I really can't wait to make my husband try this. Even though it was expensive, I thought it was totally worth it. I am so looking forward to my next meal at this food truck!! Well done!!"}
{"text":"I dream about her.  We were standing in line in the pouring rain in front of a food truck.  My hands were numb from the cold.  The lobster lady smiled as she handed us the huge chunks of lobster with a very light garlic dressing on a butter toasted roll.  It was surreal, as if we were walking alongside a seaside village enjoying our eats straight from a fishmonger.  I know that hubby was quite satisfied with his coz I didn't hear a peep.  \"I don't like it that much\", my little cutie pie handed me his piece.  I didn't argue this time about not finishing his meal.  \"I like crab better.\"  More for me.  We will be tracking The Maine Lobster Lady down like epicurean stalkers!"}
{"text":"Wicked good lobstah rolls, wonderful service, and pleasant folks.   My wife and I order from this food truck every time we see it.   The prices seem a bit high, ($19.99), but are about average what you would pay in Boston.  Worth the money unless you own your own lobstah ketch."}
{"text":"Way to expensive for what ya get. Sooo not worth it. Ordered 4 of the itty bitty  flavorless 20$ a piece lobster rolls, 2 tablespoons of coleslaw and a 25 cent bag of chips and two 16 oz drinks for $92 then they have the audacity to ask for a 15% tip!! Highway robbery!! I don't care if it does get shipped from Maine. Very Disappointed."}
{"text":"Tried the lobster roll for the first time today and was very disappointed.  About a 6 inch sandwich for over $20.00!  Quite a bit of lobster meat but not much flavor.  You get a small package of chips and a container of slaw about the size of a half dollar.  Sorry, Lobster Lady but I expected a much better lobster roll."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness...and I do mean goodness! Warm lobster roll : buttered roll, a whole luscious lobster, chips, and slaw. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Living in a state where there are no oceans it's very hard to come by good quality seafood not only is her lobster fresh but she actually cooks it to perfection. The lobster rolls are phenomenal I've never had them anywhere better than her food truck!!!!"}
{"text":"I was attending the Michael McDonald and Kenny Loggins concert when I finally got the chance to try out The Maine Lobster Lady food truck.  For my maiden voyage I went for the lobster roll which was as fresh as it will ever get in a land locked state ;)  and worth every penny. The meat was tender and I was very surprised that I liked their mayonnaise based sauce which I had them put in the side along with the customary lemon wedge.  My only suggestion is maybe they could add a Lobster Boil option where you pay a little extra to get a boiled corn cob and potato along with the bag of Lays chips that comes with.  From what other loyal customers in line told me TMLL also offers a mean lobster bisque.  If I can catch up with their truck before they leave for the season this is a definite must try.  For dessert the whoopie pie was out of this world!! I could not believe how good it was. The flavor was delicate and not cloyingly sweet like other pies I've tasted. Hurrrrmmmmmmm I wonder if she would sell me the recipe????  Unfortunately, I was so hungry I forgot to get a picture of the lobster rolls but next time I will fix that mistake!"}
{"text":"I am a Boston native and I have had more then my share of lobster rolls over the years. I was very excited to hear about the Maine Lobster Lady food truck that travels around the Valley in the winter months. There is really no place in Phx to get a lobster roll, and people here have no idea what fried clams are. My wife & I visited the truck outside of the US Airways Center in owntown Phoenix in March and was not disapointed. I got a lobster roll($18) and my wife got a clam roll($18). Both were very good and totally authentic. I've had bigger portions for the same $$ but this is the desert, I'll take it. We went back later after visiting Tilted Kilt and decided to get Lobster mac and cheese...a swing and a miss! The portion was small for $14, lukewarm at best and lacking in the star ingrediant, lobstahh! I would go back in a heartbeat though."}
{"text":"Ok, about a month ago I came across a picture of a new food truck posted by Local Foodnik Joel LaTondress, known to the Phoenix food community and the twitterverse as @AZHotdish.  Not often does a simple picture cause so much commotion, but since the snapshot in question was of a food truck focused on Northeastern seaside cuisine namely Lobster rolls and other such briny delicacies, foodies began buzzing, posting queries clamoring for further details.  Further information about where to find this culinary treasure or whether it actually existed was thin and the discussion seemed to end.  A quick check of the URL www.mainelobsterlady.com got me a contact number to call which led to a rather pleasant conversation and information as to scheduled appearances.  Today, after almost a month of waiting, I went into stealth mode to get into the Arabian Horse Show (who cares about the horses when there's lobster to eat?) and get myself a lobster roll.  The Maine Lobster Lady operates out of a very tidy, well equipped trailer.  As you approach you can almost smell the salt air and then theres the menu... Two different styles of Lobster roll, shrimp puffs and lobster chowder to name a few.  Barely able to control my glee, I ordered a tradiditonal lobster roll and an order of shrimp puffs.  Served on a hot, butter grilled roll sat easily a half pound of some of the best prepared, most succulent lobster i've ever eaten.  This sandwich is the epitome of simplicity with the barest hint of lemon aioli, chunky lobster tail and claw meat and a buttery sweet roll. I cant even begin to describe how tasty this sandwich was and the $18 price was well worth it.  To accompany my sandwich were an order of \"shrimp puffs\" ($8.50), think of hushpuppies stuffed with succulent bay shrimp, a crunchy exterior and soft, well seasoned, piping hot interior.  Oh yeah, this was just melt in your mouth delicious when dipped in creamy tartar sauce.  I dont know if you have any interest in horses but if you value your tastebuds and the happiness of your belly, get out to the horse show or find the Maine Lobster Lady at one of her other events this spring and indulge, If you arent able to find her, stay tuned as I eat my way through her menu.  You may live vicariously through my culinary adventures!"}
{"text":"We were so looking forward to our lobster rolls! We were following the schedule on where the truck was going to be where you didn't have to pay to get in. We finally went to Supersition Farms in Gilbert, AZ last night. These rolls are rated very highly, but they shouldn't be. They were honestly just ok and way overpriced! $18 for a sandwich is a lot of money. Yes, the lobster was good, but the one with mayo had hardly any mayo in it and both sandwiches had absolutely nothing else in them, No onion or celery or anything! The bun was really good though. Great butter toasted bread. They also request up to a 25% tip! This truck is making a killing, there's no overhead. I wouldn't pay more than $12 bucks for that sandwich. Their lobster bisque was $9 bucks! You have to really love just plain lobster to eat here, but I wouldn't recommend paying $18 for this sandwich. I'm on the search for a much better lobster roll at a much better price. If anyone knows of a place in metro Phoenix, please let me know. Sorry Maine Lobster Lady, but we were really let down."}
{"text":"Been hearing great things about the Maine Lobster Lady, and was rather disappointed.  Really wanted the lobster mac n cheese, but was not on the menu today :(  Ordered one of each of the lobster rolls.  While you get a lot of lobster in the roll, they were bland and not memorable.  The coleslaw was nothing to rave about either.  For the amount of money spent on the roll, I would have expected more."}
{"text":"We had their lobster rolls when passed through our neighborhood! So good!!! Wished I ordered two!!!!"}
{"text":"I had the clam roll, very good lots of clams.  I would like to try the lobster Mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Had to give The Maine Lobster Lady another shout out! Wow! Seriously the freshest lobster I've ever eaten! I think I may have changed my mind to the hot buttered lobster roll being my favorite. Huge chunks of lobster. So buttery. So sexy.   Homemade blueberry lemonade was not that good though. I couldn't taste any blueberry flavor and I just expected more. But trust me, your not gonna come to to this food truck for the lemonade. It's all about those succulent lobster rolls baby. If you consider yourself a lobster fan, you need to find this truck and go their asap."}
{"text":"Excellent lobster sandwiches.  The choices were the warm one with warm butter and the cold one with mayo and lemon.  I got both to see the difference and both were a great choice.  Maybe a little pricey, but I don't eat lobster everyday, so it's worth it.  Looking forward to them coming out again for another lobster fix and will get the same two sandwiches again."}
{"text":"Got to Food Truck Friday West ten minutes before it opened, and this truck already had a huge line. I was surprised at how relatively quickly the line went. They were so efficient and nice enough to open those few minutes earlier to start getting food out to the crowd.  We had traditional lobster rolls and loved them. So much better than we expected. Probably the best lobster I've ever had, so clean and fresh with the perfect amount of aioli. I don't at all mind paying $19 a roll when they are that good and for the decent portion size. We all know lobster isn't cheap. I've paid $12-16 for terrible or mediocre rolls at restaurants and been disappointed. Some higher end seafood joints in town charge $22-25 a roll. MLL does it right for a decent price. I'm a fan after one visit.  Also got some delicious whoopie pies, a blueberry lemonade, and a jar of peach jam (haven't tried it yet). Dropped around $60, and it was so worth it. I would definitely seek out this truck again. I can see why they have so many regulars.  Excellent food. Nice people. 5 Star food truck."}
{"text":"Finally they came to Scottsdale today! After seeing some reviews here, I've been wanting to try and kept checking back for their schedule. They were finally in Scottsdale today and I was in town!  Based on my experience in Boston, I wanted to try hot buttered lobster roll. So glad I did! Sweet, Maine Lobster served warm, drizzled with melted butter in a grilled New England style top split roll... Lobster they served was so much, very meaty and good, so heavenly.  $19 lobster roll comes with a small side of coleslaw, creamy but light, perfect compliment to the lobster roll. Also came with a bag of chips, is still sitting in my car.  Compared to what I had in Boston, their price is very reasonable for the amount of lobster served.  Service was friendly, they actually helped me take a picture. They have other food available besides the lobster roll, Looking forward for them to return to Scottsdale next year."}
{"text":"What a lady you are!!! Who else could charm $40 out of my wallet FOR LUNCH? TOTALLY worth it!  I had just finished my final and decided to treat myself to a Connecticut Lobster Roll (a roll with chunks of sustainably sourced lobster meat drizzled with warm butter). I went \"overboard\" and got double meat. SO delicious and this lobster trumps what you get in most restaurants.  They also have lobster mac and cheese, lobster bisque, shrimp puffs, haddock but I always go for the main event each time. My wallet can't handle this all the time but whenever you want to treat yourself, look no further!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love love love this food truck. We follow her wherever they go. The lobster rolls are a MUST HAVE. The lobster bisque soup is so good we want to take it home by the gallon - lol. Sometimes, we get there in the perfect time and have no wait and other times the wait it 45 minutes. It's worth the wait:)"}
{"text":"I've read the raving reviews about the Maine Lobster Lady food truck in the past but actually happened to find it this past weekend at the Scottsdale Art Festival! I was so excited to try \"authentic Maine lobster rolls\", as I have never been to Maine nor had a lobster roll before! We walked up and noticed the price of $18 for a lobster roll, $14 for lobster mac and cheese, fried haddock sandwich for $12 and blueberry lemonade for $3. Service was very friendly and was told to try the lobster roll cold, since that's how they eat it in New England. We also ordered the mac and cheese, I mean how often do you see mac and cheese lobster?! I also ordered the blueberry lemonade and waited a few minutes for the food.  The lobster roll was TINY!! There was no sauce and looked nothing like the lobster rolls I've seen before. I got a few pieces of claw meat with a few pieces of lemon on top in a tiny size hot dog looking roll. My friend ordered the lobster mac and said it was COLD! I even took a bite and was shocked it would be cold. It was also cooked with a penne pasta, which is NOT mac and cheese! The only thing I enjoyed was the blueberry lemonade.   For $43 (food and tip), this was a total disappointment!!!!"}
{"text":"We ran into the Maine Lobster lady a couple of months back at a food truck festival at Talking Stick. In a normal setting I wouldn't have anything to compare it to. Although at this particular fest there was another lobster truck we had seen on Shark Tank. Admittedly, that truck was the one we went for. I have to say after eating two Lobster Rolls that Saturday afternoon. Maine Lobster Lady knocked it out of the park!   The bread is amazing! It doesn't leave you overly stuffed. In fact, the bf had a second roll this past weekend when we managed to track her down at the food truck frenzy in No. Scottsdale. Granted $18.75 seems a little steep but after eating it and enjoying it as thoroyghly as i did, there is no regret whatsoever.  The scallop Roll was really good as well. They were large scallops in a very light batter with an amazing dill something or other aoili...   Mmmm blueberry lemonade? Yes!  We've figured out where she'll be the next couple of weekends before they head back to Maine for the summer. The daughter is pleasant, mom makes Maine lobster love on a roll :-) we love it! Shark tank dudes may have been better before expanding to a degree that the love got lost... I'll save my lobster love for the Maine lady."}
{"text":"The Maine lobster lady food truck has been a mystical creature for me and I have been on the hunt for this elusive animal. I am beyond stoked to finally be able to eat one of her highly raved about rolls! I am horrendous at tracking food trucks but I found out they were going to be at the 20th annual art in the garden event so I had to go. I purposely skipped breakfast to make sure I had room for multiple things on the menu.   I ordered the hot buttered lobster roll and the lobster bisque. The lobster roll comes with a little sauce cup of slaw and a bag of lays potato chips. The slaw was good. It was creamy and had nice flavor. The lobster roll was where it was at! They use large chunks of lobster. It's definitely whole pieces of claw meat and I'm not sure if they use the tail as well. The meat comes on a buttery grilled bun. I think they also use a buttery based sauce or something in the inside of the roll. My bun had a little too much butter on it so it was a little butter logged but it tasted great so. They give you a lemon wedge, which I recommend squeezing it on the lobster to help cut some of the fat from the butter with the acidity. At some points, I drizzled some of my bisque on my lobster roll and that was delicious as well but the roll was really good on its own.   The lobster bisque had really nice, developed flavors. It had a very strong yet refined lobster flavor. The bisque was very smooth and was at a good thickness for me. There were no lobster chunks in the soup but if you looked closely you could see thin threads of lobster so they must blend it down into the soup. However they get their base, it is fabulous. The soup comes with saline crackers. I didn't eat the crackers because I thought it was perfect without, especially since I was eating it concurrently with the lobster roll.   I paid $30 for both. It does sound expensive for lunch, but if you look at how much meat you are getting on the roll, the quality of the meat, and the flavor profile of the bisque, I would say that it's on the high side of still fair. If I ever see this truck again, I will be buying another lobster roll.   4.5/5 if that bun was crispy it would have been a full 5."}
{"text":"As mentioned by others, The Maine Lobster Lady is a \"seasonal visitor\" to Phoenix (December to April) and I have been a BIG FAN.  I have visited her this season and came away a bit disappointed this time. Oh, the freshness was FABULOUS and you will not get better tasting Lobster anywhere in Phoenix, not to mention Fried Whole (\"Belly\") Clams, which can't be found anywhere else in Phoenix.  My disappointment? I believe she has taken two Price Increases on her Lobster Rolls at once.             The ACTUAL PRICE is now almost $20, certainly a dear price, unless you  are             having a \"Lobster Roll Craving\" that can't be quenched elsewhere.              The PORTION seems sharply reduced from last year when I visited her              several times.  Maybe she has put herself into a \"Luxury Category\" that would be / is unaffordable to most.  That being said, of about a dozen food trucks in Scottsdale that evening, she was the only one with a line. Of course, patrons do not know the price until they get to the front of the line and the portion until they receive their order.  So, if you need a fix, be prepared, it won't be cheap!"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I went to The Maine Lobster Lady food truck when it was in our area in Arcadia. Of course we have heard the hype about this truck and had high expectations... which basically fell flat. We all ordered the warm lobster roll and by the time we got it the entire bun was buttery mush. We had to eat with a fork. The lobster was good, but the entire roll didn't have a lot of flavor. It came with a tiny amount of cole slaw and a bag of potato chips for $15.   I would say pass on this food truck! It did not live up to the hype. Customer service was also nonexistent."}
{"text":"Seriously the BEST sandwich I've ever had in my entire life. Connecticut Style Lobster Roll, warm and drizzled with butter on a grilled roll. Certain there was an entire lobster on this heavenly masterpiece. Worth every single cent."}
{"text":"Amazing. Best lobster you'll have all year. They're only in Phoenix for the winter, so hop on the interwebs and check out their schedule!"}
{"text":"I have heard good things about the Maine Lobster Lady, being a New England girl I had to try a lobster roll. I was expecting the buttered split buns which was great, I was disappointed in the lobster meat was skimpy and didn't taste like genuine Maine lobster which is usually very sweet and delicious.  It is a very expensive treat for me and my family.   We also had a clam roll which was very good brought me back to New England!   I was also disappointed that one if the menu items for me to try was a Whoopie Pie, sold out in 30 minutes."}
{"text":"Being a New England native I can assure you that this gal gives an accurate representation of some our our beloved seafood dishes (right down to the price).  But if you think about it , her prices are pretty good for the amount of lobster you get in a roll (i.e. you get what you pay for).  My mother and I were so excited to see that The Maine Lobster Lady had returned. Its almost unheard of to find a real New England style lobstah roll out here (see Baers Den review), and shes got it, right down to the New England style roll (unavailable in AZ). Our rolls were both toasted to perfection and housed all of those beautiful pieces of lobster perfectly. I enjoyed mine w/ the lemon aioli, a gourmet take on the usual squeeze of lemon and a little bit of mayo, while my Ma enjoyed hers plain. We also ordered the blueberry lemonade, which was a bit too sour for my taste, but still blueberry-rific.  Were so excited to go back tonight and get some full bellied clams (a MA delicacy that in 20 years we havent found anything close to down here) and some lobster mac and cheese.  Thank you Maine Lobster Lady for bringing a true taste of home out west even if it is for only a couple months a year."}
{"text":"Customer service unbelievable. The Lobster lady must have read the book -Customers for life-By Carl Sewell. Full five stars from me."}
{"text":"Really good food.    The whole belly clams were delicious and the Connecticut style roll was heavenly.  While not cheap, the food is high quality and you expect to pay through the teeth for seafood in a desert.  You'll spend about $20 per sandwich and they're served on a buttery roll about the size of a hot dog bun but overflowing with meat.  I ate two and felt good after but I'm a pig.  A normal person would be fine with 1.  Each sandwich came with chips.   I've heard the lines get crazy here but I was only in line about 15 minutes and had my food shortly thereafter.  If you see this truck at a festival or event and the line isn't a mile long don't hesitate to jump in."}
{"text":"I was fortunate enough to catch the Maine lobster lady on the last day of her seasonal Phoenix trip. I've never had a lobster roll before, but my love for lobster anything is very copious.  That being said, the Connecticut style lobster roll was extraordinary; lobster was amazingly fresh and the roll was grilled to perfection. However, I was expecting the roll to be a bit bigger for $18, nonetheless it was still delicious and worth it. Who knew food truck food could be this phenomenal?! The second item I tried was the fried Maine whole belly clam roll ($19.75); it wasn't as delicious as the lobster roll, but I wasn't expecting it to be. Anything fried, in my opinion, is fantastic, so take it for what it is...fried food in a roll. The final item to complete this trifecta seafood meal was the lobster mac n cheese. I was pretty disappointed with the flavor of this dish...it honestly tasted like plain mac n cheese with bits of lobster in it ($15). All in all, stick with the lobster roll and you won't be disappointed!   On a side note, the Maine lobster lady is a really kind-hearted individual and you can really tell that she cares a lot about her food truck and customer service. I can't wait to catch her again next  time around...I'll be the one double-fisting with lobster rolls!"}
{"text":"Only reason just got four stars was because of the price. The lobster roll was amazing it was hot and buttery but for the over $10 price I feel it should either be stuffed more or two sandwiches for the price of one. I love lobster and I appreciate the work that goes into bringing it out here but the price alone is what pushes me away. Other than that though I was hooked on lobster rolls ever since"}
{"text":"I recently tried a delicious lobster creation from this food truck at The Great American Foodie Fest in Las Vegas.   The Connecticut Style Lobster Roll was calling my name. Literally, it was calling my name. The truck has a speaker phone so that you can hear your name being called over the loud music.   The roll was loaded with lobster. It was more lobster than I've had on any other lobster roll. The fresh lobster with the butter and the perfectly toasty, buttery bread was amazing. The price was great for the amount of lobster too.  The best lobster roll I've had to date!"}
{"text":"Today we went to check out Second Sunday Surprise Food Truck Festival. My husband and I really wanted to try The Maine Lobster Lady for a Lobster Roll. I was pleasantly surprised at the flavor of the Lobster with the warm butter. However I wasn't as impressed with the bread for the Roll. It got soggy quick and took away from the Lobster. I loved the blueberry lemonade, and would love to try the truck again because it offered so many other items that all sounded Devine."}
{"text":"I had the lobster roll with butter which was very good. I'd never had a lobster roll so I have nothing to compare it to. But since it's so simple, I think I'll just make it at home."}
{"text":"I am big on seafood; scallops, lobster, clams, shrimp you name it I will eat it!  Naturally, that and the raving reviews of my fellow yelpers put \"the Maine lobster lady\" on my list of must-eat food trucks, trust me you won't be disappointed!   The lobster is perfect every time cooked just right, melted butter, fresh bun, slaw, wedge of lemon and what you have is a perfect lobster roll. You could go the traditional route that's Lobster chunks, served chilled with a touch of mayo.  They also have fried clams, haddock sandwich, lobster bisque, whoopie pies quite a variety.  I'd stick to lobster if it's your first time definitely try the rolls, comes with a bag of chips $20.00 +tax so yeah it's a little pricey for the amount of food you get.  Honestly, one roll doesn't fill me up.But hey who's complaining?  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Really loved the lobster roll. Was it worth $18? For a treat , yes. A regular thing , No. I also had the lobster bisque and it was delicious. Fun thing to do, especially to get fresh lobster in AZ but bring the bucks!"}
{"text":"We were lucky to get some great lobster rolls from this food truck at the Chandler Rock the Block festival on Saturday.  Having been to Maine and tried various lobster rolls, the rolls here are on par with what you'll find in the Pine Tree State.  I tried the traditional style, and it was delicious.  The large chunks of lobster were sweet and succulent, and the warm, toasty, buttery roll was perfect to combat the chilly evening.  We got here around 5:30 P.M.  and there were only 3 items available; the traditional lobster roll, the hot buttered lobster roll, and the lobster salad.  I would have liked to see more of the other items that they advertise on their online menu, such as the lobster bisque or seafood chowder.  I was also sad to see that they had sold out of blueberry lemonade, it sounded delicious.  The price of a lobster roll is $17, and it includes a hearty amount of lobster meat for your roll.  Unlike other food trucks that I've visited, there wasn't much of a wait at all for our food, a big plus!  I can't wait to try more lobster items from this food truck!"}
{"text":"Love this amazing food truck. Wherever they go (find them on face Book or their web site) there will be a line. They handle the crowds well. The Haddock sandwich, Clam Roll and Lobster Rolls are our families favorites. Recently tried the blueberry iced tea and it was very good. The frozen lobster pie is amazing if a little rich but you take it home frozen and prepare when you need a lobster fix. If you like a lobster roll just like you get on the coast of Maine this is the place!"}
{"text":"I'm from Maine. I go to great lengths to fulfill my lobster roll cravings in Arizona. It was like Christmas came in March this year....I am now able to get lobster rolls in Phoenix!!! As most noted, the prices are steep, but it is amazingly fresh tasting Maine lobster. It didn't taste any different than if I'd ordered one from a restaurant at a beach in Maine. I enjoyed the Connecticut Roll and the blueberry lemonade and brought the Traditional Maine Roll home for my husband. I already have plans to meet up with the truck in a few weeks. And I know many more occasions before the Maine Lobster Lady returns to Maine for the summer."}
{"text":"Hmmm... Unfortunately I had high expectations of this food based on chatter from the community as well as previous Yelp postings. I was left feeling disappointed and my wallet much lighter after my experience with the Maine Lobster Lady. I remember waiting in a long line, anxious to try some buttery goodness of lobster on a fresh bun. Unfortunately my wait and anticipation fell flat. The lobster was mushy and tasteless as was the bun it was served on. The bag of lays potato chips were the best this meal had to offer. I guess I expected more after paying over $60 for three sandwiches. My experience told me this was mostly hype and not to expect much from seafood in the desert of Phoenix Arizona."}
{"text":"Had a chance to catch her at one of the Las Vegas foodie fest. I loved it so much I want to catch up with her in Phoenix but seems like she is hard to get a hold of."}
{"text":"I really....really wanted to love the lobster roll, but it was just mediocre. Something missing....not sure what, but I will go back to try their lobster mac and cheese and see if I like that better."}
{"text":"Shes finally arrived! I have been following her since last year and I finally have caught up with her and spreading the word! Fresh as it can be in Arizona straight from Maine. And boy was it good...they may look small but they are worth every penny and surprisingly filling! The meat was tender and juicy. The sauce of lemon and mayo was delicious.  Comes with pickle and chips. Also had the blueberry lemonade..not a fan to sour for me but the rolks were on point. Would love to try more on the menu!"}
{"text":"Rude rude rude.  I have never met the most unprofessional food truck of all of Arizona.  Not to mention after being treated awful my husband got sick after eating their chowder   I will NEVER ever come back here even if I was paid to!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I absolutely love the traditional lobster roll.  We go to various food truck events as our wallet allows - the prices are not cheap, but the prices are in line with what I've paid when in Boston and other places on the East Coast.  I always shed a little tear when they leave for the summer.  I also love the blueberry lemonade since it isn't overly sweet."}
{"text":"The last time I had a lobster roll was when I was back in the East Coast. I've been trying to look for lobster rolls out in Arizona but I wasn't going to go to a steakhouse to get that. Thank God I found this food truck. I was thrown off by how expensive the lobster roll was, but it was totally worth it. It was $17 for a regular lobster roll, but it was STUFFED with lobster. From first glance, you can tell the lobster is fresh. After the first bite, you really know it's fresh!! I would definitely go back and try all the other items too. I'm so glad that if I'm craving lobster rolls, I can go to the farmers market at the barn on Wednesday and not have to wait until my next trip to the East Coast!"}
{"text":"FINALLY! I finally got the chance to eat here. Let's say, I wasn't disappointed.   They were over in Glendale at Sam's Club parking lot. It was amazing at the line when I got there. None of the other vendors came close to the size of this line. Waited over an hour it order my food, just to get into another one.   The staff was very friendly and courteous. They called out the orders by name, no silly numbers here.  On to what I was waiting to eat! My order was the Lobstah Mash and Lobster Chowdah. It did not disappoint at all! The Lobstah Mash was so delicious, that I savored every bit. The mashed potatoes were very creamy and topped with that delicious lobster chunks..... Then came the chowdah! Hands down one of the best out there. They didn't skimp on the lobster or potatoes in this dish.  My only complaint is that it wasn't enough of the goodness and the portions could be a little bigger. Either way, I'll lookout for there next stop.  Posted up a few pics of the line and Lobstah Mash."}
{"text":"Hello to my fellow Arizonians and seafood lovers!  For this review it is important I remind everyone that I am the pickiest person I know and do not mind paying the bucks but the food has to be worthy!  I have been waiting for the Lobster Lady to come back to Az for a year... I read a review last year just after she left town..   So when I read she was going to be in Chandler for Rock the Block I knew this was my chance!  My friend had recently been in Maine and experienced several different lobster rolls and was excited to experience this with me...  We found the truck around 1p and had only a couple people in line... It was $18.00 plus tax for the traditional lobster roll ... Pricey, yes... But come on... It's lobster all the way from Maine!!! Just doesn't get better than that!  We got our roll and found a shaded bench and took our first look... The bun looked and tasted like a hot dog bun with the sides cut off and it was quite small... Looks MUCH larger in the pictures but I am told they all have the same amount of meat..  The meat was primarily claw meat... Didn't see all the chunks of tail meat like you see in the pics... We cut it in half to share and each got 2 bites... Which again no biggie... The problem we had it that the meat was not super sweet... Generally the claw and tails are very different tasting... All we tasted was claw meat and we've experienced such tasting meat From the grocery store lobster tank... Very disappointing ...   Very important to realize at this point is food is a preference... As I explained I am very picky and if I am going to pay that price... I expect perfection or close to it!  Now we come to the part I want you all to pay attention to!!!!  I decided instead of just writing a review I would speak to the Lobster Lady.. And I did just that.... She was a LOVELY woman and it is obvious she is PASSIONATE about her products and proud of the fact that her husband is a lobster fisherman.  When I approached her I was pretty pissed that we just spent $18... Plus tax for what we got... Then I saw the look on her face and in her eyes I immediately knew I was speaking to a very kind, passionate and professional business woman who was extremely concerned about what her customers thought!  It's rare to see that... I felt like turning around  and not saying a word as not to hurt her feelings... That has never happened to me before! Lol  My friend and I chatted with her and she offered to gladly refund us!!! She made suggestions on what to try if we came back.  My friend and I were quite impressed and we would recommend The Lobster Lady!  Maybe it was just the batch... Maybe our expections were too high... All I know is it turned out to be a pleasant experience!  My apologies for not knowing her name but if you see her truck... Definitely give it a try and let her know what you thought... Good or bad she actually wants to know!!  Imagine that!  When I told her I was going to write a review but decided not to because she handled the situation so well... She told me I should write my review because she wants people's honest opinions...   I decided after much thought to write this but to also make it clear that we all have different taste and it is important to NEVER judge simply by one persons opinion/ review and to also TRY IT FOR YOURSELF!  Good luck on your visit here in Arizona and Safe travels :)  You are a truly wonderful woman and am very glad I had the opportunity to meet and chat with you!  Lobster Lady will around Phoenix area for a short time so get out there and get yourself some Maine Seafood!  Bon Appetite'"}
{"text":"They're generous with the fresh lobster, the mayo spread is delicious and the buns are nice and buttery/toasted. Pretty pricey for a lobster roll, but it's a niche market."}
{"text":"In its inaugural season it would be hard to call the Phoenix Festival of the Arts anything more than a dismal failure - a mere 40 artists plus some bands and organizations it was under-representative of the Valley's diverse art scene to say the least and yet at the same time it provided me the opportunity to do something I generally avoid; visit a selection of the city's food trucks - a collection of approximately ten which were present when the festival opened at 10am representing everything from lobster to pizza to hot dogs, barbeque, and pie.  Having already made two breakfast stops prior and with plans for Andreoli's Christmas Festival at 2:00pm I knew I'd need to save room and as such I perused the options carefully before settling on a trio...plus one en route back to the car.  Starting with the most unique, a food truck concept I certainly never saw in the Midwest and would have never expected in the desert, my first stop of the afternoon was at The Maine Lobster Lady (http://www.mainelobsterlady.com/,) a truck described as \"A Maine island girl, along with her very own lobster fishin' partner, serving the real deal Maine Lobster from the coast of Maine to the desert southwest!\" and the menu, service, and accent all hold true to that definition in every way.  Priced substantially higher than the average food truck given the quality of the ingredients my selections from The Maine Lobster Lady would be two - the first her signature Maine Lobster Roll with hot buttered lobster chunks served simply on a grilled roll.  Simple, fresh, and loaded with lobster this was about as simple as it gets and although small considering the $17 price tag it would be hard to quibble this quality of crustacean nearly 3,000 miles from its point of origin as it was every bit as good as that in Boston or elsewhere (where, incidentally, Neptune charges a whopping $22 for their roll.)  Moving next to a more innovative, though less impressive choice, a $9 cone of Maine Shrimp Puffs arrived as a half dozen hush-puppy sized balls of medium sized Maine shrimp tinged with butter and herbs deep fried to golden and served alongside a zippy garlic aioli.  Tender but a bit too oily for my own personal tastes and with the shrimp far less snappy than the aforementioned lobster the aioli was a welcomed boost - a shot of flavor compensating for an otherwise disappointing dish; next time I think I'd go with the Whole Belly Clams or the lobster mac n' cheese.  Good, particularly given the fact that it arrived from a truck in the middle of Phoenix, but pricey at $26 for perhaps a dozen bites of food I see The Maine Lobster Lady as a well conceptualized idea to fill a void, but not someplace I'd seek out unless I really had a craving."}
{"text":"I waited an hour and paid $50 for me and my girlfriend to have two hot lobster sandwiches and lobster Mac n cheese.   Would I do it again? YES. Believe the hype. These folks do it right!!"}
{"text":"This stuff is expensive as @#$_&! lobster sandwich $20 bucks! I have never paid this much for a warm sandwich. I should have just got McDonald's. At least they don't over charge people. Geesh..very disappointed. I don't know if I should eat it or keep it for a trophy! Or give it to the homeless!  I was have been robbed!!"}
{"text":"The best meal from a food truck I've ever experience... And I've eaten a lot of food trucks! My bf says \"if this was a stand alone restaurant, it will be packed every day\". We waited in line patiently while my mouth watered with every step closer we got to ordering our food. We both had the Connecticut Lobster roll, lobster-lobster Mac and Cheese, and we were surprised with the complimentary size of lobster bisque they were handing out for the holidays. Everything was ahhhhhh-mazing, flavorful, and fresh. I will camp out next time I know she will be in my neck of the woods and I suggest you do the same."}
{"text":"I had the warm Maine Lobster Roll. It was a bit pricey but totally worth it. It was the best sandwich I have ever tasted! The roll and lobster went perfectly together! The butter was amazing! She does not skimp on the Lobster meat either. Must have at least one in your lifetime."}
{"text":"I had the hot buttered lobster roll, and I was expecting something great for $19+ tax...it was just ok....I thought it might be chunks of lobster with mayo, but there was no sauce on it. It came with a very small cup of coleslaw, which didn't taste very good to me. The lady taking the money and the order was super nice!! I've had amazing lobster rolls in big cities for $14-$16, $20 seemed a little overpriced for what I got. Not bad, not great."}
{"text":"Only lobster roll I have ever tried. I got the butter version. To die for. The Lobster mac and cheese is amazing. The clam belly is amazing"}
{"text":"I visited this food truck at the Scottsdale Art Festival this afternoon.  Of all the dining options listed on the map, this one stood out to me the most, so I held out for lunch until we found it.  By then, I was pretty hungry.  The line was long.  I waited for about 20 or 25 minutes, and was dismayed to find that it would be an additional 30 minutes to actually get food.  I figured I had already waited this long, so I went for it.  I decided to get a beer and come back.  When I returned after about 20 minutes, it was pretty chaotic.  A lot of people (understandably) had left and come back, so there was a steady stream of people asking the harried staff about their orders.  When I asked about mine, they couldn't find it at first.  I was on the verge of asking for my money back, but I was so hungry and I figured it must be close.  I finally got my Maine lobster roll after 45 minutes (plus the time I spent in line).  Was it worth it?  Well, it was good.  I know lobster is expensive and a person couldn't really expect more lobster than they put on the roll.  I was hoping for a little more food, though.  It came with a pickle spear and a tiny bag of chips.  I don't know - fries?  Coleslaw?  It was tasty, but I don't know if it was worth all the trouble.  My husband got a delicious gourmet hotdog wrapped in warm flatbread for 6 bucks and he didn't even wait 5 minutes.  I think he got the better deal!"}
{"text":"I had the Connecticut style lobster roll and the shrimp fritters at Barrett Jackson and both items were delicious. The staff was great too."}
{"text":"\"Despite what Phoebe from Friends believed, lobsters aren't monogamous. 'Sometimes they'll have multiple parentage.'\"  Lobsters are a great source of heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids.  If you hold the butter, lobsters aren't fattening. Three and a half ounces only have 96 calories and about two grams of fat.  But when you go and see The Maine Lobster Lady, we're not thinking about these things.  No way.  Give me that lobster on that butter roll!  On a chilly November night, we finally got around to trying this beloved food truck.  We shared a Traditional Maine Lobster Roll [served cold on a warm buttered roll with a touch of lemon aioli], a Connecticut Style Lobster Roll [served warm on a warm butter roll with warm butter drizzled on top], and a Blueberry Lemonade.  They charge the market price so prices vary [$18/roll on the night we went].  So the lobster rolls themselves were amazing.  Giant chunks of sweet lobster meat... Oh my goodness.  This is why the Maine lobster reigns supreme.  I got to say that I enjoyed the Connecticut Style more than the Traditional Maine Lobster because butter... duh!  That and because it was a chilly night so the warmth was appreciated.  As for that Blueberry Lemonade, it was delightfully refreshing.  It paired perfectly with the sweet lobster and slaw.  Diana is such a charismatic lady with a great lobster roll.  I had placed the order under my name so when I was claiming a standing table nearby and sent the guys to grab the food, she playfully winked at them and called them Joyce.  Love it!"}
{"text":"MENU:  http://www.mainelobsterlady.com/id1.html   Her Hot Buttered Lobster Roll is worth EVERY penny.  It's about $19.00 and only comes with a bag of chips, dill pickle spear and a lemon wedge.  However, she doesn't skimp on the meat or butter, as most places do.  The lobster was fresh, warm, tasty, moist and simply delicious!  The sandwich was VERY filling.  The hot roll seemed to be grilled with garlic butter.  Roll was soft, but edges were crunchy.  You will need to use a fork to eat this sandwich otherwise you will have butter dripping down your hands and arms!    Her Lobster Mac & Cheese is another popular dish.  Very cheesy, moist with LOTS of lobster chunks.  Her Traditional Style (cold) Lobster Roll is also very moist, fresh and seasoned well and is hugely popular!!    I highly recommend The Maine Lobster Lady if you ever see her food truck!!    Lobster Lady, please come back down to the State Capitol for Food Truck Fridays!!  WE LOVE YOU!!!"}
{"text":"I became acquainted with The Maine Lobster Lady food truck at the 2013 Las Vegas Foodie Fest.  After an announcement that only 20 Lobster Rolls were left, I sweated it out but remained in line, because I was about the 14th person from the window.  When I reached the ordering station the truck was already out of Blueberry Lemonade at 8:30 p.m. on the second day of the festival, but I was able to secure one of the last Lobster Rolls.    The roll itself was rather small, and its contents were not warm like I thought they would be.  Instead this lobster Roll was refreshingly cold.  But it was chock-full of chunks of lobster graced by a light Lemon Mayonnaise Dressing.  Even the flippers tasted good!  I liked this cold roll despite my erroneous preconceptions of what it would be like.  It was served with a cold pickle spear, a small bag of Lay's Classic Potato Chips, and a wedge of lemon.  Priced at $18 a roll, there had better be some bang for the buck!  And there was!"}
{"text":"To start, you have to find the food truck. I was lucky to be with a regular who knew all the tricks and spots. We found it in the back of a buildings parking area. Odd spot but the line was long. We suffered through 40 minutes of anticipation. Finally our turn! We ordered the traditional lobster roll, warm bread with cold lobster.. Oh and lobster there was! Such nice portions, wonderful fresh taste. The slight only blah moment may have been the roll, little soggy, maybe not so fresh. But I would opt for the roll just to use it as a bowl.   Would become a regular but it's a little pricy.  Be ready to eat where you stand, likely in some parking  lot somewhere."}
{"text":"It's nice to see the Maine Lobster Lady make the trip out to Phoenix every winter. It gives the valley foodies a chance to try something different or something they just normally cant get here.   I have tried this food truck on multiple occasions. I have had the lobster bisque, the lobster rolls (buttered and traditional), mac n cheese and the clam roll.  I'm gonna have to say that the food I had was good but not impressive for the price. I would not recommend the bisque. There are better bisques out there right now. The clam roll was okay. The mac n cheese was okay (cold). I would recommend the traditional lobster roll over the buttered roll but then again you can get a better roll for cheaper these days.  If you are in the mood for lobster and this is the only Lobster truck at the event then go for it. You can get your craving filled. I had high expectations for this one but for me it fell a little short. I wanted to love this truck soooo bad!!"}
{"text":"Always a favorite!  We can't wait for \"lobster season\" every year.  This is a family run food truck and they go to Maine for the summer and bring back the lobster to Phoenix for the winter.  I caught them at the farmers market a few weeks ago and it was as amazing as ever.  You can go to a fancy seafood restaurant and spend more than double on lobster and it won't be even close to this quality and taste!!"}
{"text":"The fact that there is a food truck with fresh lobster and fish that moves throughout the Valley makes my heart soar.  I try to get there early to avoid the lines.  Love the blueberry lemonade as well.  I always get the fish sandwich and my husband the double meat lobster roll.  So grateful to have love on wheels in the desert."}
{"text":"Was so looking forward to trying their Lobstah Sandwich. When we arrived around 8:30pm Saturday in Scottsdale there was still quite a line for this Food Truck and the others had no line I thought this has to be pretty good.  Ordered the CT Style Lobster Sandwich which is served with Hot Lobster Meat. Also had the Blueberry Lemonade which was $18 and $3.   After waiting around 15 minutes for my 2 items I was surprised by the size of the meal and would compare it to a children's meal. I think I should have super sized it but that sandwich would have been $36.  The sandwich had quite abit of lobster for a regular size hot dog bun but for $18 it took about 4 bites to finish it.   Good thing my wife and son got their food earlier and were half way done so I could finish eating the same time after I had to wait so long for my mini meal.  Overall the sandwich was good for the lobster meat, small in quantity, high in price, not as warm as expected and did not wow me. The blueberry lemonade was also on a small cup for $3. If you are trying to eat light and like to pay $21 for a meal for yourself, this is the place! Good thing there were 4 other food trucks."}
