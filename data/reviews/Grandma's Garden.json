{"text":"The food is ah-may-zing and the lady is super nice and courteous I would recommend the fruit salad and the turkey cheese melt with a side of fries."}
{"text":"Friendly service, great grilled sandwiches, at a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"Affordable lunch. 3 dollar side soup to my sandwich is a little higher than I'd like it to be but their blt sandwich was high quality and tasty. Chicken soup was light and refreshing and they also give you a cracker packet along with it. Competitive to subway (their neighbor) worth their smaller cap business.

I wanted a small refreshing lunch so this beat out the typical subway that's usually always around the corner while supporting local businesses. Staff was friendly too.

If you're really hungry today I don't recommend having a regular sandwich here. Those days you can get a large sub.

They also use Styrofoam which is a negative for the environment. 

Take care"}
