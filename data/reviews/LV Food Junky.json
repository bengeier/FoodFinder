{"text":"Thumbs up. Among all the garbage places around here this is a real place for a quick meal and great micro beers. Found it theu Yelp!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!  We had the BBQ pulled pork fry and we devoured it.  Makes me wish we were town longer to try more.  I definitely recommend and would come back!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent and the owner is absolutely gracious as can be.   Highly recommend getting beers at the nearby brewery and then getting food here.  We had a spaghetti sandwich that was amazing!  Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"On my first visit to Banger Brewing we were just looking for a place that had a happy hour in a Sunday, now two years later back for the happy hour and hungry we decide to give Food Junky a try. Fist thought that popped into my head was wow it's pricy, then the food got to the table and after the first bite I knew that I was wrong, it's priced right. I had the Barbacoa tacos (there are three) and they are loaded with Barbacoa, and we also ordered fries \" Mexican Loaded\" with a side of jalapeño peppers. The fries were awesome so tasty with beef and chorizo on it. But, then, I had a jalapeño pepper and was blown away by how good it tasted, thin sliced and crispy and marinated. So good it blew my mind, the young lady running the food cart was super nice, she was engaging when asked about the food and was willing to allow samples of non dull house pickles, another very good item. If your on Fremont and want good beer (my fav is morning Joe, it's a coffee beer) this is a great place to stop in and take a rest from the heat. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I am pushing 50, and I have enjoyed more than my share of great food. That's the context for this claim: My meal tonight at LV Food Junky featured the single best piece of meat I have ever eaten -- period, no exaggeration. The perfectly-cooked and sublimely-spiced pork loin was accompanied by a yummy slaw-like salad. I started with the bacon popcorn, and I finished with a few pickled raspberries and a homemade cookie -- delicious, every bit of it. What a find this place is! Plus, Chef Maritza has to be one of the friendliest, warmest professionals in the business. Cheers and blessings!"}
{"text":"This small venue really has good food!  I was skeptical until people said it was pretty good, so I tried it and was impressed! My fat ass has had 4 different items and loved every one of them.  I will be spreading the news and returning here for sure."}
{"text":"Food Junky is the best place to grab a bite on Fremont Street! They are located right outside Banger Brewery. They might look small but they pack a huge punch! You can't go wrong with anything on the menu and the staff are some of the nicest people on the planet. Chow down at Food Junky!"}
{"text":"We ordered the Korean loaded fries and they were amazing! Great price and wonderful flavor."}
{"text":"So amazing! Had the loaded fries, bacon popcorn and regular fries with \"crack sauce\". Would give it more stars if possible. Best food on freemont street and the woman making the food was super nice. My husband was really happy with the Korean BBQ pork!"}
{"text":"We stopped by Food Junky twice since our stay in Vegas, and it was phenomenal! We ordered the tortas and the shrimp ceviche and it was out of this world good. The food was so delicious we had to come back...probably would've ate it every day if we could have And, not to mention the food paired perfectly with the beer from Banger Brewing."}
{"text":"The service is high quality, matching the flavor of the food!! Food is always made with the best ingredients and served with a smile!!"}
{"text":"This food is amazing!!! We traveled here from Phoenix and were pleasantly surprised by Maritza's menu, she is SO friendly and accommodating and offers vegetarian and vegan alternatives (but the pork sliders are the best). So worth the stop. We met her at the banger brewery tour ( also a great experience)"}
{"text":"I love this food stall outside of banger Brewery. This is just what the bearmunchies ordered! Barbacoa fries and an el heffe coffee kolsch"}
{"text":"Very friendly service and excellent food that goes well with the beer from Banger Brewery  A must stop on Fremont St. Don't miss it!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! We had kimchi pickled veggies and I can't stop thinking about them. Between the group of us, we shared an order of Barbaboa fries and an order Korean BBQ fries. The fries were perfectly cooked and topped with super tender pork and homemade sauces. Don't let this little stand fool you, this place will blow you away."}
{"text":"Pork ribs were super tender, fall off the bone!  Glaze was yummy, slightly spicy, and didn't overpower the pork.  The vegetable slaw was tasty, uniquely prepared including green peppers for color and flavor.  Definitely want to try some of their other dishes!"}
{"text":"Omg, The Best fall of the bone ribs I have ever had. Seriously these women are cooks from heaven, just go!  Soy chorizo nachos and hop bang boom saurkraut sliders are just as amazing as well :)"}
{"text":"Maritza makes absolutely amazing food and changes up the menu every month. I first tried the meat and cheese plate while drinking beer at Banger Brewing, expecting a little snack. Instead it was a huge plate rivaling charcuterie plates at five star restaurants, with mustards, pickles, olives, and great cheeses and meats. Since then I never miss a chance to wander over and have a beer and some Food Junky food. I think my favorite so far is the citrus rubbed pork loin. Delectable!"}
{"text":"I come in peace, I swear. I really wanted to like this place, as I really like Banger Brewing. I wonder if I ordered the wrong thing.   I came down to have some drinks with friends at Banger Brewing and thought I'd grab something for us to munch on while we began a night of celebration. We ordered the meat and cheese plate. While there were some yummies on there, I was really disappointed and thought it was overpriced for what we got. Trust me, I don't care about presentation, but I thought it at least might be better than something I could throw together at home.  The salami, a squirt of dijon, honey, and walnuts -- (see photo) those were the items that I looked at and thought, \"Oh.\"  However, I have suggestions now of what to try from these other reviewers and I'd be willing to update, but for now, I can say I was super disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. It makes Bangers worth going to. I have been here twice. The menu was different each time and the food was out of this world both times. I love that the menu changes. It makes it more exciting to go to again and again. Both times I went with friends and we all loved it. The chef came to our table several times to make sure everything was perfect. If you in the Freemont area you need to stop here to eat. You will be very happy with it."}
{"text":"The food was great and the woman running it really cared that people enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"Great service, I have been here multiple times and the service has always been awesome. The loaded fries were excellent as was the street corn. The next day I came back for a beer and tried the bacon popcorn. Yet another treat. I'm looking forward to October when I will be back in town to try something new."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Please...please....please try the Ribs!!!!! Fall off the bone good! Great service and would definitely recommend eating here again. Sincerely \"The pickiest eater on the planet\"."}
{"text":"Such good food! Soy chorizo nachos are heaven! I would eat them everyday if I could... Oh wait I do!"}
{"text":"Food Junky on Freemont St in Vegas is Amazing!!!!  The cheese plate is phenomenal and the pork ribs were to die for."}
{"text":"My friend had a Groupon for Banger Brewing and we were hungry, so we got lunch here as well. The potato tacos were nothing short of amazing. I love meat, but I didn't miss it here. The potato had a smooth texture but was still quite dense, and I felt quite satisfied after eating all 3 tacos. I found myself scooping out the cheese and slaw from the plate afterwards! My friend ordered the ceviche and thought it was great as well. This local will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Was hanging out at the Banger Brewing company which doesn't serve food but in its place was this amazing little food pop up. I didn't eat a full meal (which I am super pissed that I haven't been eating here all week), but I did enjoy their Mexican street corn in celebration of Cinco de Mayo. It was sweet and salty with a little pop of heat and I honestly inhaled it. They have a super hot salt that you can sprinkle on the corn but it was waaayyyy too spicy for me (but they always put it on the side so you can spice to your liking). After letting my corn settle, I tired the bite sized churros that are hand made and served with this chocolate sauce made from a Mexican hot chocolate recipe. It was so good, they were a little crunchy and warm and the chocolate sauce is a must, not a traditional chocolate sauce but so necessary.   The young woman who works at this pop up is so passionate about her food and it truly comes through in her cooking. Everything is made with such care and precision that she really should be working at a 5 star restaurant on the strip.  I wish I had more time in Vegas to try more things on their menu. Seriously, this is a must on Freemont street!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a small cart parked on the patio of Banger Brewing. The menu is small, but it'll help fill you up or give you something to munch on while you drink. The staff were super pleasant and friendly. We ordered the quesadilla. Meh, it was alright. There are probably other items on the menu that are better. As Rob P. put it \"I could make this at home.\""}
{"text":"Fantastic. The bacon popcorn is a must have!!! Located right in front of Banger Brewing. We also had the grilled cheese pizza. Nice bite from the crushed red pepper. Not greasy and very tasty. We had the meat & cheese plate as well. Outstanding customer service. Please do Vegas right, and stop in for a pint (also a phenomenal execution of product + customer service) and a bite."}
{"text":"Nice alternative to large chain spots. Good food resonable prices given the area. We ordered the meat and cheese just to hold us over til we find a good chain restaurant.. not that this is bad..! We just wanted a snack, so the meat and cheese was just right. The Irish Chedder was my favorite, the brie was rich.. like biting into butter! Mmm... now I'm feeling hungry!"}
{"text":"I happened to be enjoying a couple beers from Banger Brewing and decided to try the taco joint that is somehow attached to the front patio. The girls that run it were nice and I tried the barbacoa tacos.  The tacos were just OK and way overpriced at $10. for 3.  In LA tacos that cost more than $2.00 each better be extra bomb because you can find good tacos anywhere in LA for $1.25 to $1.50 each. Another example of Vegas pricing itself out of the fun zone."}
{"text":"From Hawaii, by way of the South. This is hands down the best pulled pork sandwich we have ever had. Perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked pork. Topped with a light slaw, with citrus tones and celery. DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"Had the meat and cheese board and it was awesome!! Best bleu cheese ever, and the nance was so delicious! I've never had nance before and I would eat it over and over again!!"}
{"text":"The potato tacos blew my mind.  Outstanding place and the chef is awesome.  Great place to meet 4 beers"}
{"text":"Food junky was a treat!  I had the BLT on sourdough with chipotle mayo and my husband had the Grilled Cheese with 2 different types of cheese and bacon. It was food heaven!  It was a perfect treat while we enjoyed a couple IPAs from Banger Brewery. Thank you Maritza!"}
{"text":"Fun little food cart with a server who had a very friendly demeanor. We tried the Non Dill House Pickles, more of a kimchi, and they were pretty tasty. Good snack food while enjoying the beers at Banger Brewing."}
{"text":"We tried LV Food Junky outside Bangers Brewery and it was awesome! I ordered vegetarian tacos and I usually don't like that kind of thing...delicious! The lady brought our food into the brewery for us with napkins and fresh cracked pepper. The service was great as well. When she heard how much we liked it she gave us hugs. You must try this food and support the little businesses out there."}
{"text":"Maritza and co. make the BEST food downtown at an awesome price with extra care. You can tell she's really passionate about her food and always ensures that you are enjoying your order. She'll even take your opinion on things you didn't like or could like more if (x) was added or left out.   But thats hardly a normal occurrence because all of her food is excellent! Sitting on the patio of Banger Brewing is where magic happens. This is not your typical bar food. She uses the craft beer that the guys in Banger brew and infuses them into her meals while also suggesting what beers to drink with your meal. Everything is made fresh right in front of you & don't be weirded out by the kitchen on a patio its extremely common in Las Vegas and other major metropolitan areas. If you're brave enough to eat from a Taco Cart or a hot dog stand (and lord forgive me for even comparing) this is the Forbes five star of outdoor kitchens.     Be sure to check her out often as her menu changes monthly!"}
{"text":"Maritza rocks. The food rocks. The bangers are great and I really liked the sauce that can with the fries, which were done well. Food Junky is just outside of Banger Brewing, which is wonderful in itself, but they don't serve food. Sounds like the space maritza is occupying was someone else before - she is the chef, the cook, the sever and busser - she does everything and does it with a smile. She makes you feel that you're doing her a favor by trying her cuisine, which isn't necessary but adds to the overall delivery!"}
{"text":"Outstanding little gem hidden away by Banger Brewing on Fremont.  Their ribs,salads,and actually everything is amazing.  Check them out."}
{"text":"Got the pork ribs and pickled slaw to go with my Banger beers. Meat falls off the bone. Delicious vinegary NC style sauce. Great with the slaw, which is homemade too and pickled to perfection. You do need to order and pay for the food separate from  the bar but they'll bring the food to you."}
{"text":"Amazing ribs and sliders. Perfect companion for Bangers draft beers. Maritza has incredible energy and drive. Great!!!"}
{"text":"Food junky is super yummy new spot downtown in front of banger brewing the food was super yummy and the service was great it's  a small little cart out front but don't pass it up because it's amazing"}
{"text":"Maybe the best spot to eat and walk in all Fremont. Way above all other options. Take it from a local who loves Fremont."}
{"text":"Amazing menu and the food is top notch. Hidden on the patio of Banger Brewing, the ladies here churn out some phenomenal food to pair with the beers inside. Make sure to get a visit in during your next visit to Fremont St."}
{"text":"Just had Greek sliders here at Banger Brewing from Food Junkie just outside the brewery. The sliders were excellent and the chef was great. Highly recommend trying her food if you can, also try the beer at Banger."}
{"text":"We encountered LV Food Junky at Banger Brewery. We came with a larger group that seemed to overwhelm the server, not that it should impact service. My husband was met with rude and condescending comments multiple times. When he even gave it a second try and went back after he was told she was too busy to take our order he was greeted with snide remarks again and gave up. I tried the food from others at our table and it was actually really good but we left after 1 beer each and didn't get to eat because of the horrible service. Some who did order had to wait a long time for their food as well. It seems they were unprepared for a larger crowd and let it get the best of them. No amount of stress should impact quality of service and we were disappointed that the brewery would let a contracted partner have such a negative influence on customers."}
{"text":"Super friendly service, fast, and good food. Delicious meat and cheese plate, with great cheeses. This is a tiny gem."}
{"text":"My favorite are the ribs! They fall right off the bone. Smaller menu but the quality of food is off the charts. Goes great with the banger brewing beer!"}
{"text":"Right outside of Banger Brewery. Only a few things on the menu as I think this is a sort of \"Pop up\" restaurant. The absolute must is the loaded fries with Korean BBQ sauce. We also sampled the \"crack\" sauce which is so good, I would eat it with anything. Great idea for this wonderful food stand right outside of the brewery.  The food and the beer were a perfect marriage."}
{"text":"The barbacoa tacos were amazing! Fries were crispy and a little Crack on top really did the trick!!!! Super nice girl ,names Maritza outside in  the heat! Gotta give her props!!! Food and service was great!!! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Everytime I go to Banger Brewing I get fries from Food Junky. Their fry sauce is the best I've ever had, I'd buy it by the gallon if I could. Also their meat & cheese board is like a gourmet lunchable for adults. Everything on the menu is great and pairs well with Bangers beers (Food Junky is on the bars patio) if you come here during Bangers 1-3pm happy hours chances are you'll see me."}
{"text":"The food is great, service is prompt, chefs are polite and talented. I suggest the Korean fries."}
{"text":"Nope. Never again will I come here.   We arrived at 12:35 looking for a sign or something to tell us that this was LV Food Junky - and had to ask a woman in a green apron to find out that it was. We looked at the menu and she quickly told us they didn't have 3 of the main items - but a delivery of supplies arrived as we were still choosing. We ordered 2 BLTs on Sourdough ($12 ea) and the Potato Tacos $10). We tipped ahead of service.   We went inside and grabbed some beers from Banger (their Dark Angel is delightful). After 25 minutes my friend and I went out to see if maybe we were supposed to grab our food or if it would come to the table, cuz 25 mins is a long wait for two sandwiches and two tacos (with only one other table ordering food). We were told they would bring it to us, no problem.   35 mins into our stay, I got up to check on the food but saw it being plated, so I went back to our table - SO excited. The two BLTs arrived, they were piled high with bacon, sat atop 5 French Fries on a small paper plate. Didn't look like a $12 sandwich, but this place has 5 stars....so who am I to judge? I encouraged my husband and friend to eat while it was hot, as the server told me mine 'would be right out'.   10 minutes later the server brought 6 sliders to a table across the brewery that had arrived after us. She stopped at our table and said she was going to put another taco on my plate for me having to wait. 10 minutes after that, she brought 6 tacos to the same table. I nearly lost my sh*t.   I went out to the cooking station and told the other woman out there that I could not wait any longer for my food. We had stopped there early before the Symphony and been there for well over an hour, my husband and friend had finished their meals and beers, another table was served the food I was apologized to twice for not receiving. I could see my order on the grill, just started.   The woman did not apologize. She simply asked what I had ordered. The server was picking up sandwich sticks off of the ground, didn't look at me or apologize. Nobody tried to fix it, feed me, make the situation better in any way. They returned the money to my card and seems aggravated that they had to take a minute to do so. They refunded my meal and my husbands along with the tip I had given them in advance.   Not even an 'I'm sorry'? Forget that. I wish I could give zero stars."}
{"text":"Great service and shockingly good food. We got the sliders, BLT, and loaded fries. All three were delicious."}
{"text":"I've been coming downtown for years now and Lv food junky is my favorite place to eat down there! The fries are always perfect and crispy, the Korea bbq is tender, the grilled cheese is bomb AF, I honestly haven't had anything I didn't like here. I don't typically like the meats that come with cheese platters and the assortment was divine! Hands down one of my favorite places in Vegas."}
{"text":"I stopped in to Banger for a beer as I knew there was a 5* food place here. Honestly, I was a bit disappointed. If it was just for the food, I'd give them 3*. I had a soyriso quesadilla and it was good, but nothing close to the amazeballs I was expecting. But the staff here was awesome, bumping them up to a 4*. They helped me customize my order and were super friendly through the whole process. I could see myself eating here again if I wanted something quick, hopefully next time I'll enjoy it more."}
{"text":"The food was excellent and the service was great. The proximity and relationship with the brewery made it a perfect stop. Loved the grilled cheese."}
{"text":"As mentioned in other reviews, the food prepared at Food Junky complements very well the  beer served at Banger brewery.  Note that this is not quick and greasy 'bar food' (not that there is anything necessarily wrong with that), but thought out, well prepared dishes. We had the Greek Sliders and the 5 Cheese Flat Bread, and we look forward to trying the other items on the menu next time."}
{"text":"Man I can tell you this, food was on point. Comfort food at its best. I had the BLT and crispy fries with \"crack\" sauce. For sure worth the trip and would do it again on purpose."}
{"text":"We had the bacon popcorn and it was so good! Came back later and got the frank and beans and it was perfect. Great food at a good price and super friendly!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a break from the casinos on Fremont St stop by Banger Brewing when Food Junky is cooking on the patio. They have a nice partnership set up between them and the brewery and even use Banger's beer in some of the recipes.  This is really your best option for small plates on the old strip. I have the corn fritters and salad which were both very tasty.  Also, the price was right."}
{"text":"We were lucky enough to sample a bunch of different things from our table. Sliders...who knew such a small thing could pack so much flavor. Pulled pork fries were delicious. Potato tacos were incredibly fresh. The grilled cheese was cheesy and had a nice spicy kick. Don't forget to pair it off with a beer from Bangers and people watch from the patio. Nice hidden gem in the hustle and bustle of downtown Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Jamie(sp?) is the best. The food is always amazing and the people watching is the best here (why are people so obsessed with weighing themselves?). I always get the potato tacos, they are amazing. Can't wait to come back on my next trip!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and the food has been always outstanding.  The Barbacoa Fries were flavorful and the fries were nice and crispy.    The Mexican Sloppy Joes were hot and lovely chunks of chorizo goodness in every bite.  The eats are made to order outside Bangers Brewery so sit back, relax and enjoy a brew at Bangers Brewery which is located next to LV Food Junky."}
{"text":"I miss this pop up kitchen from the Banger Brewing patio.  They had really good food to enjoy with your beer. The hummus was excellent and the salad as well"}
{"text":"Great small plates here just outside (and part of) Banger Brewery on the Fremont Experience.  I've ordered plates from here a couple times and it's always consistently good.  The Barbacoa Fries and the Mexican Sloppy Joes were served hot and fresh, a perfect compliment to Banger's craft beers."}
{"text":"I also meant to review LV Food Junky on our visit in July - great food!  The potato tacos were excellent and the start of a good base for the beer served inside at Banger Brewing.  I also tried the grilled sweet corn - a little on the spicy side for my personal taste, but still very good.  Quick, fresh food, and very friendly service.  Some may think this is a little on the pricey side, but the quality of the food and service are what win out here!  I found the prices to be in line with what I expect to pay at craft brew pubs here at home.  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"This was awesome, takes some time but I wait for quality. Make sure you get the popcorn w/ any meal, along with some loaded fries."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!!!  Greek sliders with lemon feta fries are incredible!   If you are in old town, this is by far the best food around!"}
{"text":"Delicious ribs! Maritza seems excited and serious about making this food, we need more people in Vegas who take pride in their work like she does. BIG TASTE comes out of that small kitchen.  Definitely a hidden gem, you think you're just going in for a beer a banger brewing. I can't wait to see what else she comes up with in the future."}
{"text":"Fries..... topped with brisket not \"barbacoa\" couldn't find the place, they don't answer the phone. The girl working the stand was nice but otherwise not so great. Fries  and more fries on the menu"}
{"text":"All you need to know...is....Golden Potato Tacos .        But yelp says that review is too short so....the Barbacoa Tacos are a close 2nd."}
{"text":"Yum, Yum Yum, Yum! I love LV Food Junky :) and Banger Brewing! The food is always interesting fresh, and constantly changing."}
{"text":"Seriously!!!! This is AMAZING FOOD!! Outside banger brewery .. WOW!! Maritza is an incredible chef wow!! The roasted chicken salad was so great! Fresh.... And a delight!!!! Wow again ONTHE 5 cheese flatbread!' Go!!' Don't miss this delicious experience!!'"}
{"text":"That chicken salad is to die for! The sliders were perfect with beer and we loved the hot nuts!!"}
{"text":"Ridiculously amazing food! From home made pickles to amazing Korean or barbacoa fries. Just outside of banger brewing so stop by for great food and great beer! Very mice lady who owns the cart and she makes everything fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Take note people. I solemnly swear that LV Food Junky is going to be my go-to eatery whenever I'm downtown. Located on the patio of Banger Brewing, this small outdoor kitchen is busting out some quality food. On top of that, the service is absolutely top notch. You can either eat outside on the patio or eat inside Banger Brewing. Either way, the ladies working at Food Junky will take care of you.  GOLDEN TACOS ($10): These tacos were dare I say, the most delicious vegetarian tacos I've ever tasted! This meal comes with three tacos in a perfectly fried corn tortilla shell, stuffed with deliciously soft and cheesy potatoes as the base. The tacos are topped with lettuce, a tasty salsa, and some kind of delightful slaw. I ate every last damn bite. 5/5  MEXICAN TORTA ($12): Comes with two torta sandwiches. My husband really liked them. 4/5   CRISPY FRIES ($7): The only reason we got fries is because my husband was starving, and the tortas alone weren't going to hold him off. These fries come with a side of sauce that was apparently made with a Banger brew. They were tasty, but heavens $7 is way too much for fries. Probably will not order these again. 4/5  CHURRITOS ($8): Not the most flattering shape/size but these were a nice and not overly sweet treat. Again, I think the price point is pretty expensive for this item. 3.5/5  SERVICE: Amazing! Food was out in around 10 minutes or less and the servers brought us our food to where we were sitting inside Banger Brewing.They checked on us often to make sure we liked the food and cleared our table. They also kindly brought out the churros last so that they would be fresh and warm at the end of our meal. 5/5  I can't wait to come back for those vegetarian tacos. If you're ever downtown, please check out LV Food Junky!  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2016: #30"}
{"text":"Fries and crack are on point! The owner is super sweet too! It's always great when you not only find amazing food but an amazing person to make it! Definitely a must have!"}
{"text":"Fabulous food here at the food junky!  Maritza is wonderful and the bacon popcorn and Mexican fries are a must!! Banger Brewing isn't too shabby either"}
{"text":"Consistently amazing, well thought out, and beautifully composed dishes. Whether snacks like the bacon popcorn (you want to lick your fingers) or meat and cheese plate, starters like seasonal salads, or full blown entrees like the pork loin (melt in your mouth) or the short ribs, everything is fresh, made to order, and full of flavor. The menu changes monthly, so be prepared to eat all of it and come back for more."}
{"text":"This place has a partnership with Banger Brewing, which has great beer but no food. You order from Food Junky and Maritza will bring your order inside once it's ready. Also, she incorporates their excellent beer into her recipes, so the effect is like having a brewery/restaurant combo. The menu is small, and the prices a little high, but for the convenience and quality it's still worth it overall.   We had the sliders and fries. Maritza brought us a little cup of popcorn and nuts while we waited, and it was tasty. The sliders were cooked medium by default, which is just how I like them. They were served with mustard and a house sauerkraut that was excellent. If you eat all three it's a pretty filling dish. The fries are pretty standard, closer to a steak fry than a skinny fry, but the fry sauce, made with Banger DTB, BBQ, and magic, is what will keep you coming back for more. Maritza is super nice, and is going to change up the menu a bit each month. If you're going to Banger and are remotely hungry, do yourself a favor and grab something from the Food Junky."}
{"text":"Amazing food prepared right there for you while you wait. They do all the cooking out on the patio and you can see everything they're doing. It's top-notch gourmet. Amazing taste amazing creations and an amazing experience.  Make sure you try the sliders!"}
{"text":"The only thing I dislike about this place is that we found it on the last day of our trip! Amazing customer service. The food was awesome! We had the potato tacos, bacon popcorn, and Franks and beans and all were fantastic! Hidden Jem on Fremont street!!! So good!!"}
{"text":"This place together with Banger Brewing was a delight surprise of our night. It was run by this nice lady herself when we visited, as she was cooking and serving at the same time. But she managed to do both pretty well. The menu was small and simple. We ordered some chicken wings and Mexican sandwiches. They all taste really good, and they seem healthier than most other places in Vegas. The portions aren't big, but good enough to fill you up, and they go perfectly well with your delicious beer from the brewer."}
{"text":"We ordered the fried polenta and the Greek sliders. Both were delicious! But what brought it over the top was Maritza! She was super friendly and she checked on us more than once to make sure everything was to our satisfaction. She was fantastic, I'm looking forward to coming back and trying their new menu options!!"}
{"text":"Best food in vegas. My wife and i enjoyed it so much. Very reasonably prices. Very  flavorful and filling."}
{"text":"Great joint!  Greeted by two cool chicks at the front of a brewery. Very helpful with option choices on the menu. Ended up getting barbacoa tacos, really good!  Overall a cool vibe from the ladies working the cash register and grill. Definitely a place worth checking out at old Vegas area."}
{"text":"Deciding to order the meat and cheese plate from LV Food Junky while checking out Banger Brewing yesterday was an excellent decision. We will definitely be back. The guava marmalade was out of this world. The dates were wonderful too. I can't wait to try more on the menu."}
