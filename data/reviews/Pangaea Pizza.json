{"text":"If you like raw pizza dough and artificial bacon bits, then look no further.  I've order from here about 2 years ago and I'd have to say it was really good, fast forward to now and its not worth a buck.  I phoned to ask if they were the same management/owners from 2012 and they aren't which explains the horrible raw pizza.  Don't waste money at this dump."}
{"text":"Solid pizza at a great price. We live right up the street. The establishment and ownership has changed over the years but the food is still good! They have huge pizzas available and what's better than more pizza? Lol! Last night we ordered the donair pizza and the tropical Hawaiian (bacon, ham, shrimp, pineapple, with sweet sauce). Such delicious pizzas, the bread is soft and perfect and the crust has cheesy crisp edges. Been awhile as we usually go to more trendy hip places nowadays but sometimes a cheap large true thick crust pizza can't be beat and this place has it. Takeout only!"}
{"text":"Awesome tropical Hawaiian. I only order pick up and sometimes their timing is off. I let it go based on how awesome the pizza is. The tropical Hawaiian has the addition of bacon and shrimp! Not an amazing counter to order from or anything but it is the best Hawaiian I have had!"}
{"text":"I was craving pizza recently while having a cozy movie night-in with my boyfriend and he had a take-out menu from this place. We ended up ordering two whole large pizzas with a 2L soda and greek salad. We decided to do a pickup instead of delivery and it was ready right when we got there (20 mins or so). They had run out of Coke, so the staff member who took our order went over to the 7-11 next door and bought our 2L for us! Great service and the pizza itself was pretty good for one of these small in-and-out pizza place joints. We had the veggie pizza and hawaiian - they were thick juicy slices, had lots of toppings and cooked well all the way through. The flavours are definitely different/better than your average CPU-style places and would recommend people to give it a try if your relatively around Northmount Drive in NW Calgary."}
{"text":"I'm going to assume this place has changed since the last review or I'm blind.  The entry to Pangaea now leads you to a walk-up counter immediately inside the door and there's no messing around here.  Get your food and get out.  I didn't see any eye-catching paint jobs or seating, unless there's another entry and area I don't know about.  I ordered one slice of Pepperoni.  There weren't any to-go containers so the guy sandwiched my pizza in between two styrofoam plates and wrapped it in a bag.  Not ideal, but neither is eating greasy pizza for lunch.  The crust was thin and overall I enjoyed my slice, which was quite large and a bargain for $3.00.    I wouldn't purposely order from here again because it wasn't stand-out amazing, but it's good enough if Pangaea is conveniently located near you.  April Challenge: The Underdog  26/30"}
{"text":"This review is going to be a little tough to do because I did get skip the dishes and I don't know if that had anything to do with the quality of the food or not so I'll just say what I thought and leave it up to you to decide if I should maybe skip the dishes or was the actual place.. I was going through skip the dishes looking for pizza places and this one had a really high review right so I decided to give them a try looked at their menu and I thought oh this tropical Hawaiian sounds so yummy so I ordered off skip the dishes. Well when it arrived and I opened it up and gave it a try it was one of the most disgusting pizzas I have ever had the shrimp on the pizza tasted god-awful I don't know if it was cleaning products or the shrimp and just gone a little bad or something but they tasted absolutely awful. And unfortunately even picking them off The Taste remained on the pizza so I ended up throwing out about 3 quarters of the pizza. I can honestly say I was very very very disappointed and because of that experience and just the taste of the shrimp on that pizza I will not be trying another pizza from this place so it was definitely a bad experience. Which I found really odd because everybody had ranted and raved about how good it was and how good that kind of pizza was so I don't know what the problem was but take it or leave it you want to give it a try maybe it was just me"}
{"text":"Pangaea Pizza is your pretty typical fast pizza joint.  It offers by-the-slice or whole pizza's... and at record speeds.  They were really smart putting a pizza place right next to a high school.  This is great for the students, but not-so-much for visitors looking to get a quick lunch.  It can get pretty busy and fairly crowded during a school day... especially at lunch time.  I recommend waiting until the lunch rush has died down before trying to get in here.  Although, since it is near a school, the prices of the food are extremely reasonable, if not some of the cheapest I've seen.  I mean, you can walk out of here with a whole 14\" pizza for only $13.  That's pretty darn good, if you ask me!  I think that it's just such a cute little place too.  The interior is an eye-catching lime green colour, which makes it appealing yet comforting.  There's a few seats that you can enjoy your grub at, but they also have nice to-go boxes.  It's a pretty good pizza place for being quick and inexpensive.  I just wish all those damn high school kids weren't swarming the place!"}
