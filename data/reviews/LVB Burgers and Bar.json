{"text":"Started going wrong with the drinks the noozle must of been in another drink because we couldn't tell what we were drinking. Our appetizer never came out and when we told the bartender she was like oh ok.
If I could give zero star's I would first time I ever felt this way.
Really the worst restaurant I have been too."}
{"text":"The burgers are horrible; they tasted like pre-made boxed patties.  The fries were under cooked and the service was so poor I can't find a word to describe it! There was 5 of us and every burger came out wrong!  Wrong bun, wrong cheese or no beacon!  They brought the correct bun over and the missing beacon. Took the burger with the wrong cheese and scraped it off and added a few crumbs of blue cheese.  The waiter did nothing to make it right!!!!!  :(  It was much better two years ago!!!"}
{"text":"gee i was shocked to see they want 7.00 for a shake. i asked they use real chocolate ice cream, answer is not  they add chocolate syrup to it  is that what you want las vegas geee????

screw that place they arent getting my shake money..."}
{"text":"It was much better under it's old name.

The service was great, but the food was lackluster.

Don't you hate it when they don't remove the hard core from the tomato and put it in your sandwich?

The bun was grilled and left to harden.   The patty was cooked correctly, but I am not a big fan of preformed patties... they tend to be overworked."}
{"text":"This place is super slow service is horrible over priced and the food sucks I always stay at the mirage and love it. The pantry is so much better service is GREAT food is FANTASTIC hotel service is FANTASTIC"}
{"text":"The service was absolutely fantastic. We had a group of twenty people and had a wonderfully attentive server who was on top of everything. The food was good, nothing too special though. Good variety of milkshake and drink options. The prices were reasonable considering how expensive everything else on the strip is. It is truly a burger place. If you aren't wanting a burger it's better to choose a different restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was really good.  Had the basic burger is was delicious.  Also the Casear salad was really good.  My cocktail was not so tasty.  Which is why I rated a 4"}
{"text":"I arrived to a half full restaurant. The food (burgers) took 40 minutes or more to arrive. Shortly after the food arrived, the drinks ran out. The server eventually walked by and we were able to ask for refills. It took 20 minutes to refill just the water, and another 10 for sodas. By then, we were done with the food. Waited another half an hour and no server. Eventually found the manager and got the check. The food wasn't anything to write home about (the food that came correctly that is), and the service left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"I'd like to start out by stating I'm not a burger fan in general however I was really looking forward to trying out LVB's spiked shakes. I put together a group of about 10 people on a Tuesday night to try this new place out. I have to say that the service we received was excellent.  One person arrived early provided the hostess the details of our party and sat at the bar waiting for us to arrive. The hostess prepared our table right away, when I arrived the dining room was busy but not entirely full. Our party were slow stragglers (probably a restaurant's worst nightmare, a large group that doesn't have their details in order) so we were able to spend some time with the bartender, he was gracious enough to provide me with a taster of one beer, being a new beer drinker I'm not always sure which to choose but found one I liked right away. When I inquired about a container behind the bar hoping it was some fruit infused alcohol without my even asking he gave me a taste of the most amazing white sangria as well. (By now I note I'll probably have to note names and titles of things for future reviews). We eventually sat at our table once most of our party arrived. A sweet blonde waitress attended to us right away. with so many people we all wanted to try everything and we nearly accomplished just that. Crunchy Green beans, Amber's Ale Fried Pickles, Diablo's Huevos, Boulevard rolls, and Loaded Potato Bites to start! Each unique and amazing, some with a special dipping sauce (Zesty boulevard sauce is to die for, i want it on everything now). I will never order Fried Pickles or Crunchy Green Beans any where else, these were entirely too delicious.  On to our main course, again we each ordered different burgers and passed them around to try. KIK (Kick In the Kisser), OMG (Oh My Gosh), WTF (What The Flock), to name a few. Again unique and full of flavor! and finally the moment I was waiting for and whole reason I put together this band of misfits. The Shakes!!! We ended up with one of each, I can't say that any were terrible but a few that were note worthy were the Strawberry Shortshake, Snickerdoodle, Stay Puft, Cold as Ice, Jailhouse Rock. I should just list them all! In the end it was a great experience I look forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"No gluten free buns!!?? Really, even cheap burger places have gluten free buns. They have lots of \"rules\" without any regard to the customer.....can only split bills 4 ways....I've never heard of a restaurant that can't split bills more than four ways. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Came here as a last resort and was very impressed actually had an Asian food craving and could not find anything close by. So hunger got the better of us. Ordered the KIK burger and wow, best burger I have ever had. Fyi, I never leave reviews and maybe you can tell but I have had a few beverages. That only emphasizes how good my burger was"}
{"text":"If you are staying at the mirage and need a cheap place to eat at, you could do a lot worse.  I wouldn't make a special trip just to eat here but I was happier with this meal than I was with my dinner at craftsteak and lago at bellago."}
{"text":"Burger was very good. Cooked perfectly. French fries sucked. Standard old frozen fries. You think a gourmet restaurant would have at least fresh cut."}
{"text":"My friend and I had the blue burgers.  I ordered it Med Rare, he ordered his Med with no veggies.  Mine was served Med Well, his was served Rare with veggies.    :(
The burgers were mediocre - little to no seasoning.
I asked for the manager.  She apologized for the mix up, but did not offer to make it right. 
2 burgers,  onion rings,  1 milkshake, 1 mixed drink....  $80. High priced yuck!
I highly recommend skipping this high priced \"McD's\"....
Oh and just when I thought it couldn't get worse....
A couple hours later I was nauseated & sick and so was my friend.  
Needless to say I'd give it ZERO Stars if that was an option...."}
{"text":"We were seated quickly which was nice. It's a burger place, but the lowest price is $16 just for the burger. We paid an extra $11 to get a small draft beer and fries. The fries were cold and not tasty. The burger was nothing special, but ok. We both had the bacon cheeseburger. I wish it had regular cheese instead of the cheese spread. Overall I think it's a bit over priced for what you get but it is Vegas."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. Not exceptional. The nachos were ok, but used waffle fries instead of tortilla chips as one would expect. I enjoyed the burger and fries. My wife had a salad that was, well, a salad. The milkshake alcoholic beverages were intriguing, but we were too full to try them."}
{"text":"The burgers are so yummy! I've been here three times and what I appreciate is that consistency. My favorite burger is the LVB burger, the caramelized onions really compliment the burger just right. I tried/shared two types of spiked milkshakes, the birthday cake milkshake and the jacks snickerdoodle milkshake; both were different and delicious. If you are in the mood for a good burger, definitely try this place! It has a cool atmosphere where you can watch tv or people watch."}
{"text":"I had their kick in the kisser burger and fried pickles. The burger was delicious but was slightly undercook from how I wanted it cooked. What sucked was the service, the hottest sat all the customers in one servers area. So our server was very busy and rarely came to check on us to refill our glasses."}
{"text":"Good service. Disappointing food.  

My 1st time dining at LVBurger since CPK and The Still were closed.

Ordered the Rikaki wings (7 wings $14). Bland not crispy just awful.  The fries were not freshly cooked, bland taste, chewy as if kept under a heat lamp. Ordered the Bacon Cheddar Burger well done. Look good on the outside this burger had ABSOLUTELY no flavor and dry as heck. For the price you pay, you would expect better food.

Enjoy staying at Mirage but will not dine at LVB."}
{"text":"Burgers are tasty but a little spendy. The spiked snickerdoodle milkshake was delicious!  Fries were crispy but bland."}
{"text":"A turkey burger... yes... turkey burger... was the best burger I have eaten in Vegas before. And that's after hitting-up a whole lot of burger places by now.

We tried the iteration of this restaurant prior to LVB once while staying at Mirage, and didn't like it too much. But, we were hungry, and had been on quite the mid-day Fat Tuesday-daiquiri stroll up the strip, so why not try again?

It did not disappoint.  Great ingredients, good food prices, lots of unique options; but just okay cocktails (although expensive for what you're getting, even for Vegas standards).

Located across from Rumbar near the side strip entrance to Mirage, this is a must-visit if you want a good burger near the Mirage."}
{"text":"I can't describe my \"Duck Burger\" it was stuffed with Munster cheese..moist and delicious.   If you like lamb, they also have that.  I say, unique and delicious. . Must try"}
{"text":"They got my wife's order wrong. Reordered her dinner, but 20 minutes later, it still hadn't come out, while my food went cold. We canceled, and got food elsewhere. I suggest you go somewhere else for smarter staff."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is bad!!! We grabbed a quick dinner here before heading to a show. The burger was just atrocious, it was incredibly salty, over cooked and just not value for money. When I pay $16 for a burger, it better be good. In N Out make a better, tastier burger than this for less than $5. The sweet potato fries were also aggressively salty. Add to that the fact that the hostess made us (including my handicapped father-in-law) wait for about 10 minutes before setting us despite the fact that the restaurant had at least a dozen free tables at the time. Save yourself some money and go to a burger chain on the strip."}
{"text":"Food is good but overpriced. Service is terrible. Didn't get my drink until my meal was almost finished and I had to ask for it three different times. They weren't even busy."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in Vegas 2 weeks ago and were looking for a place to have lunch after checking in to our hotel. My sister suggested LVB and even though it didn't appear to be well reviewed, it was after 2pm and we figured we would give it a try. I got the Market Greens salad and the Jack's Snickerdoodle, and my boyfriend got the B.C.B (Bacon Cheese Burger) and Irish Coffee milkshake. We both loved the food and the service was great! My only complaint was that I should have asked for the dressing on the side. I would definitely go back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is surprisingly not the burgers but the milkshakes. That being said, the burgers are very very good. We had the lamb burger and it was cooked just right with Oodles of Lambie flavor. The curly fries are also top-notch. However the winner had to be the spiked milkshakes. They were huge and delicious, with really fun toppings and, if you have eaten one of the enormous burgers, a little bit difficult for one person to finish. That didn't stop me from trying though!"}
{"text":"Really not that great. For a place that touts their burgers, it was mediocre at best. First, it took 9 minutes from the time I was seated to be approached by a waiter. And it wasn't that busy. Second, if someone asks for a burger cooked medium, please deliver it as such, NOT well done! Fries were cold upon arrival, and nothing more than dumped into a fryer from a frozen bag. I can, and do, better at home. I had to ask for a refill. And NEVER put a lemon wedge in my drink unless I ask for it. Two stars is being gracious."}
{"text":"Service - great!
Shakes - not worth the money - half the glass is filled with whipped cream.
Burgers - we had three at our table. One was perfect. One was way undercooked. Veggie burger was way overcooked. Our server noticed the mistakes after we began eating and apologized but did offer to recook. We also did not have time to wait for new food."}
{"text":"This place has the best burgers in town! Our service was exceptional and the vibe was upbeat and fun. The manager made a point to go to every table to see how everything is tasting which really impressed me. Overall this is a great place to stop and get a great meal and a milkshake; we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is delicious!  Burgers r day n juicy. Onion rings r bomb.  Wait staff was nice. . Everything on point.  Def his the spot.  Amazed"}
{"text":"Lots of money for an average burger experience.  Our waitress has been far less than friendly.  I am not impressed in anyway."}
{"text":"Disgusting. Don't waste your time. 

Bought two burgers for lunch. Waste of $50. House staff seemed more inclined to talk amongst each other than to serve the customers. Very, very disappointed the Mirage would put up with this bullshit.

Tried calling twice to get a refund on our meal. No answer both times. Not surprised."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers! And very fast service.  Food was at our table within 5 minutes.  One of the best burgers I've ever had.  The quality of the meat is unlike any other.  Juicy, flavor packed, and delicious.  Easy 5 stars to give away on this one"}
{"text":"I don't know why this placed didn't get better reviews than it did. We loved it. We were put off by the other reviews initially but glad we finally caved and tried it. We were short on time that night before going to the Terry Fator show, so we opted to eat within the Mirage hotel. Everything is a la carte. The shakes aren't cheap, but they are so good. We tried the Nutella, the Banana, and one other. All were good. I think my favorite though was the Nutella. We opted for the non-alcoholic, but they make those too. Our burgers were ridiculous, and we loved the fries. Honestly, we'd do it again. We weren't disappointed with any of it. Check my pics. :)"}
{"text":"The worst burger I have ever had. I asked for the burger to be medium and it was raw. We ordered 2 burgers,shared fries, and 2 waters... and our bill was $46..... not only was the food horrible and not very well priced, but I got food poisoning from here! They leave the mayonnaise on the table so I had asked for ketchup only... and didn't realize there was mayo on my burger, until half way through eating it. 

DO NOT COME HERE. Pay $10 for Uber and go down the street to shake shack (on the strip) or in n out (off the strip). You'll not only save money but save yourself 6 hours from being sick and RUINING your vacation."}
{"text":"The shakes are amazing and the service was great!! Fried pickles were over breaded for sure. Potato skin bites were awesome too."}
{"text":"We should have looked at the reviews before committing to eating here. Our plan was to eat at BLT BURGER which was awesome. It looked the same with a similar menu but that is where it ends. 
I ordered a bacon cheddar burger with onion strings. The burger was warm and cooked correctly but the bacon was cold and floppy. The onion strings were cold as well. The fries were cold too. Never again."}
{"text":"This is gonna be kind of an odd review. First, the food is DELICIOUS! You are probably wondering why the 1 star review. I am a local. I have a charge card that I use exclusively for my time I spend on the Strip. Hadn't used it in quite some time. It also was THE ONLY place I used it on that visit to the Strip. Used it for our lunch here. THE NEXT DAY,  I am alerted by my bank of suspicious activity on the card. Called the bank and they confirmed that there were $2400.00 worth of charges on the card (online purchases). My bank would not tell me where they were being shipped to, but confirmed it was definitely not my address. Again, I hadn't used the card in at least 2 months. I called the LVB and spoke to the manager to alert him and also to find out if a cashier closes out the tickets or the waiters themselves. He confirmed that the waiters close out their own tickets. I explained what had happened and while he listened, he seemed rather aloof about the whole thing. While my bank is not holding me responsible, I hope they nail this person and he is held responsible. My review is just a warning about payment there. I will not name the waiter because I cannot be 100% certain he did it, I AM 100% certain it happened there. Too coincidental for it not to have happened there. In closing, the food is delicious and I would highly recommend it, USE CASH!"}
{"text":"Quick lunch. Standard burger and the fish for me.  A bit pricey for the standard eats. Tasted as expected."}
{"text":"It was the best burger that I have had in my life.  I ordered portabella mushroom burger and my son ordered duck burger ( first time to see this), my husband ordered LVB burger and my daughter ordered bacon cheeseburger and everything was awesome and great.
We definitely come back here again"}
{"text":"Best shake in Vegas!! Salted Caramel with Bourbon, they nailed it. Burgers are amazing as well."}
{"text":"We stopped here today for a late lunch and absolutely loved it. I had a heavy breakfast so opted for the southwest salad with grilled shrimp added. My husband had the bacon cheeseburger and fries. We both absolutely loved it. Cleaned our plates, and the portions were generous!"}
{"text":"TO THE MANAGER:

As a public health nurse, your WAITERS/waitresses NEED TO BE TRAINED ON KEEPING FOOD SANITARY AND KEEPING THEIR HANDS OFF OF CUSTOMER'S FOOD. I came in this past weekend and called my waiter(I do not want to disclose his name) to the table to request a \"better knife\" than the table knife to cut my mother's burger. He quickly disregarded my request and turned around to an empty table next to us to grab a clean table knife... he volunteered to cut the burger and did not hesitate to listen to if we agreed or not... HE CUT MY MOM'S BURGER IN HALF WITH NO GLOVES ON. HE HAD ONE HAND PRESSING DOWN ON THE BURGER and his other hand holding the knife to cut it. My mother and I were shocked and just observed him cut the burger in half. He then walked away and shortly after I processed what had just happened, I raised my hand to call him over and he mocked me by raising his hand too and chuckled. Since we arrived, he already had a sarcastic humor that could be misinterpreted as RUDE. He came over and I pointed out what he did and educated him on what he did was not right. EVEN SUBWAY USES GLOVES TO CUT THEIR SANDWICHES. I only called him over to request a knife and he ends up taking his own \"initiative\" to cut my mom's burger WITHOUT BEING ASKED. My assumption is that he was too lazy to get a knife in the kitchen as it was already around midnight. I pointed out that I observed him handling money/credit cards, picking up dirty dishes/dirty napkins, etc. throughout our sitting. He did listen to my concern and was apologetic. THIS IS A NO-NO in environmental health! He ended up taking my mom's burger off the tab and giving my mom a new, \"clean\"(hopefully) toasted bread. 

WOWWWWWWWW is all I can say.

Educate your employees or else the public health department will."}
{"text":"We ordered the LVB burger and buffalo chicken sandwich ($16 each roughly), both with a fry and drink combo (+$7 each). I wish the fries were included at that price point.  Portions were pretty large and neither of us could finish our burgers, but the taste wasn't anything special. Meh. The shakes looked good but we didn't order any.  Service at least was excellent and fast; the waiter never let my drink become empty.  It's an average restaurant burger, wouldn't say gourmet."}
{"text":"The burgers were excellent and super juicy. The avocado dip was fresh and delicious. And the burgers were more than filling. And the French fries were good and fresh. Very nice place to people watch as people walk in and out of the Mirage hotel and casino."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate my brother's 21st bday. Food was alright. Service was terrible. We waited too long for our food. And it was really hard to get the attention of the staff. And when the bill came we asked them that we wanted the bills split and they ended up giving us attitude. Definitely not coming back here. Maybe if the staff was a lot more friendly and accommodating it would've been a different story."}
{"text":"I'm going to start off saying that this review has absolutely nothing to do with our waiter AJ he was very friendly and attentive however it took us 40 minutes to get our burger our Burger was cold seriously people it's a burger how long does it take to get it to me... also it was $15 for a burger don't get me wrong $15 for a burger seems normal until you add another 7 to $11 for french fries and a drink and did I mention I waited 40 minutes and my burger was cold..... but again it has nothing to do with my way there my way to AJ was a good way"}
{"text":"I went to the to go window to try and place an order, my mistake. The lady did acknowledge me, which was nice, but she made me wait while she made a couple shakes. I got to watch her stick her non gloved hand dip into a frosting jar so she could rim a shake glass. She then used her hand to put sprinkles on the glass. At some point she decides to put a glove on, but only to drizzle chocolate from a bottle. She finally came to help me and when I asked about the special for the month she pointed to a sign at the end of the restaurant and said she didn't know what was. I walked down to the sign, and the special actually looked good. But after my encounter with her I decided not to get something from there. I left the casino and got food elsewhere. Hopefully at some point this month she learns the special. 
Maybe I would have stayed if I didn't have to go figure out the special myself."}
{"text":"Burgers!

The 2 times we ate from LVB were both from the comforts of our hotel room at the Mirage. Given the long wait times for room service, my boyfriend ventured down to LVB to grab grub to-go. And both times he ordered the O.M.G. (OH MY GOSH) burger, $17, a duck burger stuffed with muenster cheese, smoked ketchup, heirloom tomato, watercress, and roasted duck mayo with a $5 side of classic fries. And both times I nibbled off his portions while snacking on my miscellaneous snack things as I always do.

I will say, that duck burger is good, though pricey. You get that umami kick from both the patty and the mayo, making each bite incredibly rich. They also don't shy away from salting their extra crispy fries, which I loved. Good fries are always a treat.

Pricey, but at least the food is good!"}
{"text":"Absolutely NOTHING to write home about in this place. Burgers are simple and lack taste and creativity....especially for the price tag."}
{"text":"Formerly known as BLT Burger, LVB is located in the front of the Mirage.  We arrived late one evening with plenty of empty tables to seat.  Their procedure of seating isn't the best.  The manager that evening was putting a time limit between each party.  I really didn't understand why since he could seat everyone standing in line.  Oh well.  

After sitting down, service from then on was great.  Drinks were filled promptly and were checked on frequently.  

I ordered the AAA Burger with sweet potato fries.  The AAA stood for angus, applewood and arugula.  It also had boursin cheese and sun dried tomatoes.  The burger was great.  Very juicy and filling.  Sweet potato fries were way over done.  I could barely eat them.  Plus it seemed as if they gave me all of the little scraps leftover to fill the fry container.  That was a disappointment.  

Overall the experience was just ok.  I could eat the burger again but it won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"Pros : friendly server, good service, burger was good. 
Strawberry shake was tasty. 
Manager was very friendly and sincere. (Read below) 

Cons: my fries were cold and my wife's were so hard they couldn't be eaten. 

We had a long wait time for our food. The manager came over and apologized for the delay as there was a party of 19 that was just ahead of our order. He was very polite, professional and offered to buy my wife and I a shake of our choice. I find this kind of care from managers to be very rare. 

Overall a nice experience but they need to work on the fries. I would give them another try."}
{"text":"Average burger, had the LVB. Fries were good. Fountain drinks did not taste good, had a coke at first then changed to a sprite, still not good. Daughter had the pigs in a blanket which were alright. Everything just added up to a high bill at the end. Waiter was cool and helpful, thanks! Would most likely not recommend, but if you go hungry, it fulfills."}
{"text":"My bf and I went to LVB a couple of days ago.  We just wanted to grab a burger before heading out.  We were quickly seated but it was down hill from there.  We placed our order and requested the burger be cooked well done.  Of course, 15 mins after ordering we were still waiting.  This is typical, especially when you order it well done.  They finally bring the burger......definitely not well done.  Matter of fact, there was small corner that looked absolutely raw.  Almost as if they dropped a piece of raw meat on it after it was cooked.  So we tell the waitress and she takes it back.  She comes back to the table and says the chef messed up but they were gonna fix it.  We thought it was gonna be another 20 mins but the burger was brought back in 5 mins.  Bbbuuuttt instead of making a new burger, they recooked it...apparenlty with the lettuce, ketchup and all still on.  What we received was a well done salty patty, with now soggy inedible lettuce and a ketchup infused bun.  We just askef for a to go box and the check.  Looking at the reciept..she didnt even put it in as well done.  $16 for that mess of a burger.....very disappointed!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very tasty food but definitely on the pricey side. Burgers and onion rings are the ticket!! Service was good."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best burgers I've had in my life!! We had the potato wedges for an appetizer that were not worth it. Very small and overpriced. The onion rings weren't great either, but the LVB Burger was amazing! It didn't even matter about the other things not being that great. Service is slow, so just go into it knowing that and you'll be fine :)"}
{"text":"Great place to have a man burger!!! The place used to be BLT but now it's LVB. It still has the best burgers and delicious it is. The service was great and the place was clean. The manager and staff were very friendly and engaging. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Epic burger and shake!!! K.I.K. burger was so amazing and tasty. Defiantly a good choice"}
{"text":"There are way better burger places on the strip. Nothing was great but nothing tastes bad. The blue crab deviled eggs were my favorite part. The KIK burger was decent except we had awful stomach aches and bowel issues after. It was not cooked correctly. We asked for it medium but it was more like rare, and the waitress told us that was medium. It wasn't bad tasting like I said but we won't be back. All fries were okay. Don't recommend spending money here, overpriced for what you get. Disappointing."}
{"text":"I have ate a lot of burgers in my time. This is the best burger I have ever had.  The AAA burger with boursin cheese, bacon and arugula is incredible.  In a world full of Mediocre burger joints I am not crazy about hitting a random burger joint but we were on the way to Carnagies in the mirage bit it was closed so we went here for the sake of convenience.  I am glad we did.  Juicy succulent medium rare burger with an order off truffle potatoe wedged was incredible.  I am looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"The burgers here were good but the salads could've been better. The wedge salad had way too much dressing on it (I like a lot so if it was too much for me then it was too much) and the sautéed onions on it had a weird flavor. I would come back because the burger was good."}
{"text":"Simply too good. Was bummed when BLT was changed into this but when I tried it, not disappointed one bit. And love that it's in the heart of my beloved Mirage. Shakes are awesome and unique. Southwest salad was surprisingly good as well. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a quick place to grab a burger while walking the strip in Las Vegas and happened upon LVB Burgers and Bar and are we glad we did. It's a smaller, recently opened place just inside the entrance to the Mirage. I had the Kick your Kisser Burger and it was fantastic. Cooked exactly as u requested, the burger itself was great and the added toppings of guacamole, jalapeños, onion and aioli were all fresh and very tasty. We also had fries with cheese and bacon, not real 'fries' as we expected but were a delight. We highly recommend LVB Burgers and Bar."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch here. Not sure why all the low star reviews. Tried the duck burger with sweet potato fries and fried pickles. Tasty food, excellent and quick service. One star off because this restaurant doesn't participate in getting a percentage of your bill discounted for staying at the mirage"}
{"text":"Let's just say a rose by any other name still smells the same. This used to be the BLT Burger and it was pretty bad. They closed, reworked the menu, or so they say and were supposed to be better. Always want to give the dining venues where we are staying a try so last night we ventured in.

We ate early, about 6:30 and the place was pretty empty. Three hostesses standing around talking and several couples waiting to be seated. Showed our platinum club card just to see if I it helped and were told to stand over there which is exactly how it was phrased. Couple In Front of us seated and we all stand there waiting. Finally hubby goes up to a man In a suit and asks why with all the empty tables were we just standing there.  Oh he says, is a table ok instead of a booth?  So we are seated and shortly a server arrives, takes our drink order and says she'll be right back. 

We both ordered a LVB burger and onion rings to share. Now mind you the place is almost empty and anyone who cooks knows it doesn't take long to grill a burger, but it was 20 minutes from ordering to receipt. Not only that but both burgers were Luke warm at best. They are cooked medium supposedly but more like medium rare. Onion rings were just ok, hot but not a very nice breading.

Too bad they still have all the same problems."}
{"text":"Unquestionably the worst chicken sandwich I've ever had. The chicken was so rubbery, I could barely bite it. Eventually, I left half of it on the plate. The server didn't seem to notice or care. 

Maybe their burgers are better, I dunno. 

Service was surprisingly slow, items went missing... I'd understand if it was really busy, but at 10:30 on a Sunday night? C'mon."}
{"text":"It's a burger restaurant that can't cook burgers. Completely raw. Waiter didn't apologize. Good times!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! Food, service, drinks....all incredibly good.   Perfect for lunch on the strip.  SO good!burgers were perfectly cooked, bun was light and delicious! Waiter was very attentive and courteous!  Well done! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I were on our way out of the casino when we saw the word \"burger\" and felt like we needed to stop. We hadn't really eaten much the whole night but we definitely had a few drinks ;-) we figured a burger would be a really good idea before we headed back to our casino. We were able to sit anywhere.....and that is because there was no host. There is totally a host stand with nobody there, so we took it upon ourselves to find a seat. We were wondering if anyone would come up to us to serve us because they didn't even know we were there. A few moments later we were approached by our server. We ordered an American burger to share and fries. I came out in about 15 minutes and all together with my fiancé's beer it was about $30, with another six for tip. The environment really wasn't great, that is one thing I look for in Las Vegas dining. The environment is always so grandiose. This, not so much. It was very bland, and even the people sitting around us did not look like they were having fun. They have boozy shakes. Which someone sitting next to us was drinking. That looks good. But the overall experience, not great. I would pass this one up."}
{"text":"How long does it take to get a burger here ? Restaurant is half empty and I've been waiting forever not to mention it took Forever  for the waiter to come to us after we were seated. Haven't tried the food yet but I'm already disappointed regretting my decision to eat here"}
{"text":"Located inside \"The Mirage\" is LVB Burgers and Bar which satisfies getting your burger fix. This place is conveniently located near 1OAK so a good option to grab a bite before hitting up the club. I came here on a Saturday night and service was pretty good as I was seated immediately which was nice no wait.  

For food I kept it basic and ordered the *O.S.B. (Old School Burger)*.. with cheese and I paired it with a hefeweizen beer. The burger itself tasted great and the atmosphere is even better with modern decor and even TV's for viewing sports. The service too was pretty good and overall a decent option for grabbing bites.. even salads here for those who don't want a burger. =]"}
{"text":"My friends and I came here for lunch since we stayed at the Mirage and was too hungover to walk far in the heat. We chose LVB Burger because it's a restaurant we don't have in Texas. 

My friend and I were gonna share two different burgers, half & half, and two sides. I chose AAA with the truffle parmesan wedges and he chose KIK with curly fries. We ended up eating only half a burger each and probably half our own sides. We were pretty full.. Burgers tasted yummy! Really liked the AAA burger and I normally don't like burgers.

Service took awhile before getting to us, we had already chosen everything by the time she came by to get our drink orders. But she was still attentive with water or when we needed her."}
{"text":"Eh, it's ok. Our sandwiches were good, but really nothing special. I had the basic burger and hubby had the Buffalo Chicken; yummy. We got milkshakes twice and were disappointed. They hype the milkshakes but the flavors were not on point. The marshmallows in the s'mores shake were actually kind of gross. I would say if you are tired and just looking for a burger, go here. But if you want something to remember try something else. Walk over to the Venetian for options!"}
{"text":"We found ourselves another winner!

Two days and three different Burger places.   I am committed to finding the best burgers I can wherever I go.  

I just devoured a 'Las Vegas Burger' and it was juicy flavorful and exactly what a burger should be.   Sure it was messy, but that's half the fun!

I immediately texted a buddy to let him know that this needs to be on his radar for Burger consumption this week.   If we have to suffer through bad conference food, knowing where we can find respite in the loving arms of a well made burger is vital to our very survival.   

Add to that with perfectly made waffle fries and the 'Black Forest' shake (cherries, dark choc chips, and choc ice cream) and you have a full and happy guy right here. 

A big shout out to Diego for bein a great waiter too.  He answered my questions, stayed on top of things for me, and was a great guy all around.

The virtual cherry on top was the booth right on the walkway to people watch.   

Yup...  I'll be back"}
{"text":"Had lunch there on a Wednesday. The burgers are amazing and service was prompt. I am not giving 5 stars because of the prices, you expect to pay high prices for food in Vegas but $17 for a basic cheeseburger is absurd. Other than that I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Eh. The beef in the burger pattys could use more flavor. The bun was just a standard sesame bun. Nothing special. Fries were small & bland. I wouldn't come back a second time. They don't sing or do anything for birthdays so keep that in mind. They do have a birthday shake that you can purchase for $14-16. I think I'll try other places for the rest of my stay. I think this place needs an upgrade on ingredients/menu. This review is strictly about the taste of our food only. The service was outstanding but the mediocre food trumps it."}
{"text":"This should have been a five star review however our second visit wasn't as good as the first.

On the first visit we were seated quickly and our food was delivered promptly and cooked to order and tasted great. The prices were comparable to other places on the strip. 

On our second visit two days later my wife's order was completely wrong. She cut the burger in half and saw that it came out raw instead of medium as ordered, and it had onion on it which she asked be withheld. She sent the burger back and when it came back it appeared to be the same burger as it was cut in half like the one we sent back, plus it was no well done. It almost seemed as if the took the same burger cooked it further instead of starting over. Called the manager over and we got our meals for free since she never got to eat hers and I couldn't finish mine after my wife couldn't eat. He also apologized for the error."}
{"text":"I have had worse burgers for $20, but this was far from the best I've had as well.  Our food was well prepared, came out cooked Medium as ordered, and was tasty without being memorable.  The helpings were big enough to fill me, and overfill my wife.  They have an extensive craft beer selection, and I thoroughly enjoyed my choice - my wife likewise enjoyed her (amazing looking) milkshake.  I was dissappointed not to be hungry enough to follow my burger with a desert shake for myself, but that will have to wait for next time.

The service was decent, I don't have any specific complaints, menu was comprehensive without being extensive, and seating was comfortable, if just barely.

This won't be the top of my list for a return trip, but is solid enough that I'd probably eat here again."}
{"text":"Truly nothing more than a 2.5 star experience and since Yelp won't let us use half stars, I'll be generous and round up.

Three days into our Vegas weekend I was craving a veggie burger w/ an egg on it and while I was willing to make the trek to Ketchup or BurGR or Fat Burger, my friends were not.  We were staying at the Mirage so we landed at LVB....we should have gone with any of the other options.  While the experience wasn't bad, it just wasn't all that good either.

The veggie burger was bland.  I mean Bland.  Overstuffed and BLAND!  I got the KIK burger which comes with peppers, cheese, spicy sauce, avocado, and an egg...and the bland patty STILL came through even with all those other flavors to try and mask/save the burger.  They couldn't help salvage the underwhelming veggie patty which is thoroughly disappointing being as how amazing looking the burger was when it was served.  The curly fries were tasty...so I guess that's a win?

Our server was fine, always making sure we didn't need refills or anything else and as noted in other reviews the food did take quite some time to come out.  

Would I come back...I'd say most likely no.  In future I'd do much more to convince my friends that it's worth the time and energy to trek down The Strip to other locations.  Sorry LVB but to claim that you're Las Vegas' Burger is just blatant false advertising...or if you're gonna try and lay claim to that fame then you best step up your game.  Sorry, not sorry."}
{"text":"I used to really enjoy this place when it was the other burger place. Came here late night after a concert and was super disappointed. The Nutella shake was supposed to have brownie bites, but didn't- and the only Nutella was on the outside of the glass (what's the point?). The nacho fries were DRENCHED in beer cheese, so bad that the once crispy fries were completely soggy. My husband was so disgusted he couldn't eat it. Burger was ok but really not worth the price. Not satisfied"}
{"text":"This is a fun little restaurant that's open late.  The adult milkshakes are fabulous as well as the food!  They make fresh whipped cream daily to top the shakes.  You can even get them to go!"}
{"text":"Started out with the jalapeño poppers. Tasted like they were frozen not fresh.  The pepper had very flavor. The cream cheese had a good texture and was very creamy.  Ordered the cheeseburger and was average at best. The most disappointing part was the drink prices were over the top."}
{"text":"Stopped for dinner before Beatles LOVE
I had the Vegas Leamonaid which was okay and the AAA burger which was really good! Yes, messy but most good burgers are
My husband got the bacon burger and then we shared the Spiked Caramel shake, so good!
We got there around 5pm and sat at the bar,  they didn't get busy till we were about to leave so service was great! 
Yes expensive but unfortunately that's what we've come to expect on the strip"}
{"text":"50 minutes to get one burger, fries, and an order of wings.

We made the mistake of dropping in here before our show (Beatles LOVE). We informed our host we were grabbing a quick bite and though we were seated immediately, it took fifty minutes from the time we ordered (not sat down) for our food to show up.

We basically inhaled our food, had to grab another server to pay, and ran out of there. We got seated at 5:45 and still missed our 7pm.

Absolutely ridiculous. For a $17 burger joint I expect better than that."}
{"text":"Having a dairy allergy, I typically feel like when asking waiters/waitresses if a particular item has dairy in it, I get the cold shoulder. Our waitress took the time to explain my options to me, and even went to ask the chef a few questions. I ended up getting the P.M.B (portabello mushroom burger), and it was fantastic. I don't know how burgers taste different between places, but the burgers here were wonderful. While the fries where an additional added on price, they was a good quantity of them. I did ask to have a fried egg added to the burger, which didn't come out. But I didn't even notice because of how good the burger looked when it was brought out. Our waitress took the cost off of the bill, of course. Overall, I was very impressed by my meal here."}
{"text":"We stopped here because it had a great setup for two strollers. Family friendly for sure. 

We ordered the KIK Burger, and AAA Burger.  My son are the Boulevard Rolls, as they don't have a kids menu. He loved them!!! It's more of a fried egg roll, but Hamburger ingredients. It made my 2 year old happy. 

The KIK Burger was absolutely delicious!!! It's not spicy as I expected, but great flavor pairings, and it's not messy!!! The fries are old school fries like shoestring potatoes. Definitely delicious and crispy. 

My husband said his AAA burger was just another burger, nothing spectacular. 

It's a little pricey, but I'd say it was worth a try."}
{"text":"Food was great! All the shakes had there own twist. The burgers were also fabulous, there were both your trad'l toppings and then the more eccentric ones. The family enjoyed the variety. The triple A is a must try if you enjoy sundries tomatoes and arugula. Final compliments go to the staff from waiter to hostess who went out of her way to compliment my children."}
{"text":"Service is awful, takes forever, won't split checks, food undercooked and gross. So many other options for better value in the Mirage."}
{"text":"Diego was the BEST server! Thank you for being so kind and attentive! Made our dinner experience fantastic."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, but the service is very poor. Waiter took our order, someone  else brought food.We sat there with no refills on drinks, waiter didn't come back till we had finished meal."}
{"text":"I had the AAA burger which has Arugula, boisin cheese, and bacon.  I asked for it on a ciabotta bun and it was excellent.  I would give the burger 5 stars.
The fries were so-so and the flavor of the tea and lemonade mix was off.  $30 for a meal is expensive... But, is consistent with the other restaurants.  
I would eat here again. In fact, I think the flavor options are better than they were before they changed the restaurant."}
{"text":"Disappointing.

I miss the old BLT Burger. I have a beautiful memory and photograph of a delicious marshmallow milkshake from the prior restaurant that was here. I wanted to have it again. Yes, it changed to this place, but I was hopeful upon looking at the extensive milkshake menu.

I had the marshmallow shake here at LVB Burgers & Bar. I got a cold, raw marshmallow on top of a very mediocre, tinny-tasting bunch of disappointing thick liquid. Yucky taste and all the calories I am sure. They do not have any desserts here, just milkshakes - know that before you sit down if you are craving some cake or something like that. 

Had a burger too. The burger was so so. 2 stars for the bun that tasted ok. Salad blah. Of course, the meal was expensive and close to $100 without any alcohol. Typical of most of Vegas.

I am not coming back."}
{"text":"I was bummed to see that BLT Burger was now replaced by LVB Burgers but I thought it would be good to try.

Food: We sat down and I ordered the Original burger. It was cooked just right which was great. But the bun wasn't grilled enough and by the time the burger got in front of me, the bottom bun was mushy. Overall, the burger wasn't bad.

Service: we didn't get checked on one time. And the staff congregated to the back of the room and talked and laughed and did whatever else they were doing.

About $50 for a mediocre burger and fries. But hey, you should expect to pay higher prices in Vegas."}
{"text":"I came here with my husband for dinner on our vacation. It took forever for the food to arrive. Once the food arrived, it was a wrong order. The server went back n corrected the order. But all the food was cold; which is outrageous as it seemed that the food was actually ready for a while but just never delivered to our table. The taste is below average. My hubby asked for med beef patty n it arrived well done. I don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Meh. Had the duck burger and it was okay. Our group like their shakes more than their burgers. Prices were standard expensive casino prices but there are better burgers in town. Maybe change the name to LVS for las vegas shakes with a side of burgers."}
{"text":"Wir waren nach der Volcano Show des Mirage im LVB für Cocktails und Snacks. Beides hat geschmeckt - obwohl bei den Cocktails am Alkohol gespart wurde.

Die Bedienung - bemüht aber unbeholfen - hat durchaus noch Potential nach oben.

Alles in Allem jedoch in Ordnung."}
{"text":"My friends and I were staying at the Mirage, so out of convenience we decided to give this place a try after the day club. The menu itself had a lot of interesting options with creative names, I settled for the \"What the Flock\" (a turkey burger) and a side of fries. We waited quite a while for our food, probably 20+ minutes. When we asked the waitress if our food was coming soon, she said they were in the middle of plating them, however, it took another 15 minutes before it came out. It would have been better if she just told us the truth rather than getting our hopes up. The burger was OK, nothing special or out of the ordinary. The fries were kind of hard and had a chewy texture? A friend had the duck burger, which she enjoyed. Overall, it was a good place to try but I wouldn't come here again. 

**Important to mention that while we were eating, we overheard the waitresses complaining/talking smack pretty loudly about other guests. That's not okay."}
{"text":"One I'm not for writing reviews unless it's that good or that bad! 
Worst burger place ever that I have been to! No joke, the bacon onion straw burger or (B.C.B.) on Menu, was absolutely atrocious. Dry as hell, needed some type of BBQ sauce or special sauce on. When I asked for a side of BBQ sauce, what did I get, lol! Well a 2oz packet of sweet baby rays, in a peel of container in plastic, this place was supposed to be high end! Not to mention there cheese choice on that burger, a beer cheddar sauce? It was absolutely horrible it was like Velveeta and powder American Cheese combined, not so good made it even worse with that  choice!
The only other thing I could say is the staff was super friendly and we're working hard, not sure about management or owner tho! One girl was so upset she was in tears and I felt very bad for her, management or the owner needs to get their shit together and come up with a better system of how the restaurant industry works. For 2 burgers that were less then bad and 4 beers at $80 crazy! Good-luck if you choose to eat here. Nothing but complaints from lots of people, not just us. 
Hope they get it together the potential is their but I wouldn't even give this place one star but it was the lowest I could!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch on 2 consecutive days. Both days the service and food was amazing! The W.T.F burger and the K.I.K were very good. My friend also go the salmon burger and said that she loved it as well. The servers were polite, the manager Rachel came over several times to ensure that our meal was great. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The bomb! I had the LVB burger, awesome house made bun, thick Angus beef cooked to a perfect medium, fresh lettuce,tomato,pickles and sauteed onions & your choice of cheese. Skip the fried pickles, French fries were okay. Awesome spot to watch the game!"}
{"text":"Poor service along with fast food quality burgers, not a good combo! We wanted for a table well dozens of table went empty. The over weight asian was managing the place into a hole."}
{"text":"Wonderful (huge) veggie burgers. Best I've ever had. Maxine at the take-out counter is an absolute GEM. Great food. Fantastic service."}
{"text":"Great food. I ordered the bacon cheddar burger; it was one of the best burgers I've ever had. The service was phenomenal also. With wonderful customer service and food I will make sure to come back here on my next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"13 members of staff walking around and NOT ONE came by our table. Actually, they came by and kept walking. One came by just as we are about to leave! Pathetic"}
{"text":"Meh.  The food at LVB is just okay.  The bacon cheeseburger is good, but it's not $16 a pop good.  And it's not good enough to justify having to pay an extra $7 for mediocre fries and a booze free drink to complete your meal.  
The Cajun buffalo wings were interesting.  I enjoyed the \"Cajun\" spin on the buffalo sauce, although I know next to nothing about Cajun food.   The chicken itself was overdone and chewy.  But again, seeing a Cajun wing on a menu was a nice surprise.  
Beer prices - not a nice surprise.  The cheapest craft beer on tap you'll find here is $9 a pint, which I suspect is Bud Light poorly disguised as a \"light lager craft beer\".  I know cheap beer when I drink it, you're not fooling me.  
P.s. Don't come here if you're starving with low blood sugar.  The service, although friendly, is painfully slow."}
{"text":"I'm glad I didn't read the reviews before coming here. Not sure why this place isn't a solid 4 stars. The AAA was one of the most delicious burgers I've ever eaten, so I'll be back. The server was friendly and attentive and the food came quickly. The fries were nothing out of the ordinary, but the burger was amazing. The balance of flavors with the bacon and sun dried tomatoes and the Boursin cheese was perfection and the arugula added the perfect bit of contrast. Really a well thought out burger."}
{"text":"It is tradition to go here after seeing a show whenever we are in Las Vegas.  We have always been very happy with the food and the service.  We typically get fried pickles, a cheeseburger, and fries.  Basic but always enjoyed!"}
{"text":"There were hardly any customers in the restaurant and yet the bartender couldn't listen or take the time to get my order right. Very disappointing. And the French fries are terrible. Burger ok, but not great. Real problem was the the bartender couldn't care less."}
{"text":"A nice somewhat upscale burger experience on the strip. The menu is fairly extensive with several different protein choices for those not in the mood for a beef burger. Lots of choices for toppings. Good craft beer list with many styles and some local brews as well. Service is adequate and tables turn over fairly fast even during peak times. It's a nice place to watch a game too thanks to the huge projector screen and multiple televisions. Excellent burgers as well."}
{"text":"Not bad! I was definitely expecting worse. My gf and I stopped by Mirage to cash out a slots voucher and happened to see this place on the way out. 

We were seated pretty quickly and the service we received was nice. The pricing is what you would normally see at a restaurant in a casino (somewhat pricey). The food quality was surprisingly good. The chicken burger that I ordered was actually quite tender and was still pretty juicy. At the same time, it was not dripping with grease or fat. The chicken wings were decently sizable and had good flavor. They were definitely better than anything I have had at buffalo wild wing or wing stop. 

Would I go out of my way to come here? Probably not. Would I come back again if I was hungry and roaming the casino? Without a doubt."}
{"text":"I had the burger with avocado, jalapenos, and a fried egg. Cooked medium. It was crazy good. Staff was attentive and manager checked in us twice."}
{"text":"I have to say I was extremely disappointed with everything at this place. The burger was ordered medium and it came out raw. We had wings that tasted like they were burnt. The onion rings were so doughy I don't even think that onions existed in them. I ordered a makers Mark on the rocks and the drink was half water. There are so many great burger place is in Vegas I would run from this one!"}
{"text":"Omg Every time I land in Las Vegas I stop here. I love this place! Hamburger are so juicy and delicious. Love a great place that offers how I would like my hamburger cooked. Milkshakes are to die."}
{"text":"Not very good. Had the fish sandwich (haddock). Fish was overly breaded and not tasty at all. The fries were cooked properly but over salted."}
{"text":"Friends in town who wanted to dine here, only reason I went. I cant understand why any local would go here unless it was basically the same situation.

I admit, I am concerned about the pricing on the strip, it has gotten so out of hand and this spot is a perfect example.

$85 for a lunch for three which included
3 burgers
2 fries
2 craft beers
1 coke.

Its simply in my opinion too much. Service was fine, not slow at all as some of the reviews here state.

I had the bacon cheeseburger, the meat was fine, it had way too much melted cheese and was a mess to eat. Another reviewer mentioned a grilled cheese on a bun, that was my same thought."}
{"text":"The special one (wife) and I had dinner last evening. It was amazing. She had K.I.K. (KICK IN THE KISSER) and loved it! She is a big Burger fan and this meet her needs exactly. Well cooked, presented and loaded. I had the B.B.C. (BUFFALO BLUE CHEESE CHICKEN) w/ onion rings. Outstanding. The blue cheese Cole Slaw on the Burger was fantastic. Service was perfect and the bill wasn't bad. For those in the Armed Services they give a great discount. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"You had me at adult milkshakes. That's what I said to my friend when we were trying to figure out where to get lunch and she was describing the spiked milkshakes that LVB Burgers offers. That alone makes this place worth a visit. Located in the Mirage, this restaurant has monthly specials and a regular menu. I tried the mint chocolate shake. It was pretty rich and delicious. I also had the AAA (Angus, Applewood, & Arugula) Burger. I ordered my burger medium well and it came medium. Together the burger and the shake was a lot of food. So, the one downsize of this place is that you might end up in a bit of a food comma after eating here. (Or taking leftovers back to your room.) Although, it's Vegas so it's pretty likely this is going to happen whether you eat here or at another place, like a buffet. Our server was really friendly and our food came out quickly. This place is a little on the pricey side. The burger with avocado and fries was $21.50 and the shake was another $14. Overall, add this place to your list of places to eat in Vegas."}
{"text":"I can say that the shakes are the best here! There's your 1 star. 

However, after the manager greeted us pleasantly it was all over from there. If I could give a zero I would. The entire customer service experience was terrible. Waitress was the most unfriendly person I have ever had serve me. First she didn't bring my son his water, we waited 10 minutes before she came around again. She had the look as if she hated her job. I had to ask for napkins, straws, refills on water. It was like we were an inconvenience to her. This experience reminds me that the cost of a place doesn't mean great service. If you're hungry wait it out... go anywhere elsewhere. Maybe if you want your food to go you can at least skip the 1/1 interaction."}
{"text":"Nice burger joint in The Mirage. 
The price is a bit steep for burgers and fries, but that's no surprise given the location.
Buddy and I actually opted for the exact same meal so can't delve much into variety, unfortunately.
The BCB (Bacon Cheese Burger).
A fatty patty (like an inch and a half thick!) on a nice soft roll, doused in a creamy, dense cheddar sauce that was more along the lines of a fondue (which was awesome) topped with some nice smoked bacon and french fried onion straws.
It was a delicious dish, indeed...and the integrity of the bun was not undone by the massively juicy burger or creamy cheesy goodness swimming around inside.
Bonus.
This place is à la carte (again, no surprise there) so sides come separate.
I saw onion rings, sweet potato fries and regular fries walk by while waiting to order, and they all looked like good options.
However, when the waitress told me that the curly fries come seasoned, I was sold.
The amount of fries in a serving is actually quite formidable, they are delivered in a silver cup like an old timey diner or new timey gastropub. At first glance it looks pretty chintzy, but pour that sucker out and your plate is swarmed. 
Easily enough to share.
The dining area is pretty wide open with a ton of big screen TV's spread amongst the walls.
As for the atmosphere, quite loud what with all the drunken Vegas roustabouts staggering by and the lack of a full partition between the tables and walkway.
All good though, makes for some great people watching.
The bill (after tip) came out to around $50 (I wanna say $15 each for the burgers $5 each for the fries and a couple bucks each for the soda).
So yeah, it's a little more expensive than the McPick 2 you can pick up across the street but that fast food can't even front."}
{"text":"I had the lamb burger and the mint chocolate milkshake (with alcohol)... Milk shake was very tasty and the lamb burger was good too but it was kind of dry..  Servive was amazing, will def come back for the milkshakes!"}
{"text":"We had the Diablo Huevos to start which are deviled eggs. The eggs were bland and did not have a taste. The crab on top also wasn't flavorful. We then split the Old School Burger with Tillamook Cheddar. It too was very bland. It's as if this place doesn't believe in seasoning if any kind and the bun was so hard that I chose to just remove it. The fries were decent but it's hard to screw up fries and the local IPA was so so.  Only eat here if you want to pay the overpriced cost for bland food."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers, but really unimpressed by the fries this time around! We've been going here for years, since it was called BLT Burger, and I thought I had read that only the name changed but something else was off this time."}
{"text":"I loved the food there and the service was amazing! Special thanks to Rachel who was very attentive and made sure our food and service was perfect.  I tried the turkey burger and K.I.K burger.  Both were super yummy! Definitely will be back and highly recommend it. The shakes were great too. Two thumps up"}
{"text":"The Classic Burger was alright but the Mushroom Burger was amazing. Our server was good, he was very attentive with our table. We gave 4 stars instead of 5 because the host ignored us when we arrived but the manager seated us as soon as she saw us and the michelada I ordered needed a lot of work."}
{"text":"We were passing through the Mirage, getting ready to head to the next casino and we saw the sign that said their flavor of the month was a snickers shake with booze!! My husband got the Snickers (flavor of the month) and it tasted identical to a snickers bar! I had the Carmel snickerdoodle and it was amazing!! We could have drank those all day. If you want a cool treat, get one of these! We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Admittedly I'm writing this about 2 months after I came here, but my last impression was this place wasn't so great.  The food was fine and the service was friendly yet slow.  It's near the front door and if you're sitting down near the entrance you might catch an unpleasant cold breeze (we were there in November).  It was also quite expensive.  A few beers and a couple burgers later you're looking at a $60+ bill.  I kind of want to give it a 3 star rating but I would probably go back to Mirage's Carnegie Deli just a few feet away before I came back to LVB."}
{"text":"Grease, grease and more grease. The egg in my burger refrigerator cold. Some \"nachos\" extra greasy. So never again for us. Had to (sorry) expel the food a few minutes later. Lots of Pepto during the night. Plenty of burger joints in vegas.
SO AVOID THE mirage. Try the venetian ."}
{"text":"Burger was decent. Ambiance ok. Nothing spectacular 

Service was poor. It took the waiter 15 mins to greet us. Over 20 for one burger and fries. 

They do not have a kids menu. For mid price hotel that has a lot of kids attractions and other family restaurants I expect a kids menu. 

The chef refused to split a burger and put on two plates. For $16 for a cheeseburger and $5 for add on fries  I don't think that is a ridiculous request to ask for the spit before serving. They slapped a smaller plate on the table and told me to split it. 

The server never came back to fill the waters or clean the table. A must for diners with children. 

The pickle for the burger was hardly pickled. 

The fries were lacking flavor even to the kids. 

Skip it and go to The two other family friendly restaurants"}
{"text":"Enjoyed eating here when it was BLT and LVB did not disappoint. Large burgers, good drinks, and friendly staff. As for the other reviews regarding the price...this is The Strip in Vegas, everything is expensive."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks. Our waitress was also very attentive and nice! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We had a great Vegas visit- including burgers at LVB. Conveniently located on the Mirage property it was easy to get to. The burgers, fries and shakes were fantastic. Quick friendly service too! We will visit again."}
{"text":"Pass on this place. There was no taste to anything.  The only reason for the 2 stars was our service was good and onion rings were decent. Oh, and my pickle. I had the buffalo chicken sandwich. The bread was falling apart and was pretty tasteless."}
{"text":"Burgers, shakes, fries, and a bit more. Large portions, relatively inexpensive (for Vegas). Fast service and they take reservations, so good for pre-show dinner. Or a great place for a refreshing (and filling) shake.
Our server was really nice, making sure that everything was ok with our orders. 
Great place to eat in Vegas"}
{"text":"I stopped by here since I had to go to the Mirage to pick up my Beatles LOVE tickets. OMG the Banana Cream Pie shake is sooo good, creamy, and delicious. My Bacon Cheeseburger is really good too - the burger is huge!! I would've been better off sharing my food with someone else."}
{"text":"We had lunch here yesterday and I cannot recommend it enough. Petar our server was the best. They have a burger with an egg on it that my husband gets every time. This time they had a special fajita burger and I am so glad Petar recommended it. This was one of the best burgers I can remember having. They have a good beer selection and my husband really likes their boozy shakes. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"A rare occasion for me to visit a restaurant on the Las Vegas strip but had to try out this new hamburger joint.  Let me tell you they did not disappoint the reviews don't do them any justice.

Two adults and two kids came along and they loved it too. Both kids got shakes they were delicious.  We ordered two W.T.F (Turkey) burger, a K.I.k burger and A.A.A. burger and everyone loved each one and was satisfy. 

The curly fries were my favorite item too bad my burger was large size and couldn't finish my fries. As a local I will be back once a month for sure and recommend this place to anyone who loves burgers."}
{"text":"We knew from coming here previously that the portions/burgers were pretty large so we decided to split our meal. We ended up ordering the spin dip (yum.. love the fried pita chips) and the LVB burger, medium rare which they did to perfection, plus a fried egg on top. We just had beer to drink so that's pretty hard to mess up but the staff was friendly and the food came out fast and hot. It was also March Madness so it was pretty busy but for a table of two we were sat right away."}
{"text":"they have good and delicious foods! but they make you wait for like 5/6 minutes in line till someone else is coming behind you in the line! then they gonna give you service!they want to show people that they are so busy and they have a line and stuff! 
but the burger is delicious! and worth the money!"}
{"text":"Landed in Las Vegas starving but wanted to get to my hotel to check in. My room wasn't ready so I had time to weigh my dining options. A burger is never a bad idea so a colleague and I tried this spot. I ordered the B.C.B. (Bacon Cheeseburger) and it did not disappoint. They have an option to add a beer on for a discounted price. I ordered a local Ale but cannot remember the name (sorry). It was all good. Overpriced but good. I strongly suggest trying this place once if you're staying at The Mirage. They also have good milkshakes but I was too full from the beer and burger!"}
{"text":"Bad from the start. The host tried to seat us at a tiny table by the bar stairs. When we asked for a booth instead (there were several available at 4:40 pm on a Friday) we were told by the host to go back outside and wait in the line. The host then proceeded to seat the two parties behind us in booths and make us wait. After about 5 minutes the host sat us in a booth that was vacant the entire time we were waiting. We sat for 12 minutes and got glared at the entire time by the host. Right as we were about to get up and leave our server came over. We ordered the cowboy nachos and two beers. It took us almost 10 minutes to get our drinks. When our server brought our drinks we ordered a burger and fries to share. The cowboy nachos came out pretty quickly and tasted great. As bad as everything was going we didn't think it would get worse, but it did. It was over a half an hour before we got our burger. Yet the table that was sat next to us 30 minutes after we sat down, with a different server, got their food, ate, and left before we ever saw our burger. We ordered the burger medium, came out well done and very salty. When our burger finally came we ordered two more beers. Half way through my second beer I noticed that my glass was dirty! When I told our server he took the glass and brought me a new beer. No apology. Worst part of everything is that it was our anniversary. Thank god we had a $75 resort credit to cover the $72 we wasted at LVB Burger. Don't waste your time, patients, or taste buds. 

TLDR: Food sucks, service sucks."}
{"text":"The burgers looked great but I decided to go with the BBC chicken sandwich which was the best chicken sandwich I've ever had!!! Came with a blue cheese slaw that was delicious on a ciabatta it was amazing!! I also tried my wife's LVB burger and it was also very good. I'll be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"Had a fantastic experience at LVB. Not a fancy place which was exactly what we were looking for. Burgers were excellent and service was superb. I don't remember our servers name but she was from Milwaukee and had the greatest attitude. Thank you LVB"}
{"text":"This place is completely mis-managed.  The GM and floor manager were sending servers to do all kinds of things other than waiting on patrons.  Only five tables in the whole place with  more servers than patrons and service was terrible!

Ordered a shake and it sat in the window for 10 minutes.  Food took longer than it should have.  At that point we were so frustrated that we would never return."}
{"text":"My wife and I stayed at the Mirage, so this place was super convenient. They do have many different burger options, but I was not that big of a fan of the burgers (only tried the beef burgers). The burgers were definitely big, but a little messy and not really warm/hot. The french fries and fried pickles were pretty good. If we come back, then we may pay the extra few bucks and get the duck burger (those did look really good).

The milkshakes on the other hand were amazing!!! You cannot go wrong with the nutella flavored milkshake. You can also get your drink spiked! They also have decent combos you can get with your burger (like a milkshake), so I definitely recommend going that route. 

The whole Las Vegas area can get pretty pricey, so you are getting a good deal relatively speaking."}
{"text":"Friend and I ate here in the afternoon, I had a cheeseburger, friend had the same but with all the fixings. Both burgers were ordered well done, and both came out with very pink \"sections\" which had me thinking the patties were frozen. My friend got a thick wedge of lettuce and an old tomato on her burger. Burgers were not hot and neither was the service. For the price, head over to Fat Burger and get a better burger at a better price."}
{"text":"We are locals and came here before a the Beatles Love show.   This is a hard review because some aspects were really good and some, not good.  
The good parts are, my burger and fries were good.  I got the spicy burger with a fried egg.  The other people in the party did not complain about their burgers.  Food did not take too long and no wait to get a table on a Saturday night.  
The bad parts are the milkshake was mostly whip-cream - the glass is small at the bottom and wide at the top and it was about 1/2 full of whip cream.  The service was spotty after we got our order - we needed a few extra napkins due to the juicy burger but our server was MIA.  We also felt  rushed to leave, even though there were many open tables.   Overall a mixed bag.  Prices were $16 for a burger and $10 to combo for fries and a shake.  Your call on whether that is expensive or not.  +$30 per person.  Not expensive, but a bit much for what you get.  
This was our second time here.  First time was better.   
Overall, not bad good burgers, but might shop around a bit."}
{"text":"Duck.  Burger.  
If you like duck then look no further than this amazing creation.
No more to say really. I'm gonna finish this thing and can't stop smiling while I'm eating it!!!"}
{"text":"I'm here at the LVB having dinner date with my husband. We came here last year to grab some burger last time and was not fully satisfied. So I told my husband let's give it another try. I'm glad we did, OMG what a difference the portion was a lot bigger and taste much better. The only only thing I want to point out is that I was not satisfied with the portion of fries that you have to order on a side. The service was great and our waiter was awesome (Jennifer H.) very attentive."}
{"text":"It may still look like BLT on the inside with the same layout and tables. It may even have a three letter acronym for a name but the similarities stop there.  Gone is the wide selection of amazing shakes. There are only a couple selections to choose from now. The burger I had was mediocre at best and the curly fries were downright bad. Of course they are still charging the same Vegas prices as before.  I used to regularly visit BLT on my trips to Vegas. I will not be visiting LVB again."}
{"text":"Love this place inside the mirage used to be BLT really good food and service it's a must go ambience is also a plus!"}
{"text":"This is an excellent burger joint - and likely the best casual dining in the Mirage/TI area. If you like a great burger, you won't be disappointed.

The staff was attentive, the food was incredible and I'm happy to have found a great burger destination.

I got the OG with bacon, Guac and cheese and it was perfect. My friend got one of the fancier preconfigured options and literally said it was the best burger he had ever eaten.

You can select from many different options or just build your own.

Excellent. Recommend."}
{"text":"Great service, okay food, a little overpriced (but isn't everything around here?). This was not a $48 meal (before tip). The shakes were too sweet, fries were too salty, and the buns too big (these babies got back) and bland. Bobby's Burger Palace had less interesting choices but the burgers, fries, and shakes there were better in execution and cheaper to boot (nearly half the price).

Husband's seasonal special turducken burger was interesting but had too many sweet elements; it could have done without the cranberry halves and the apple pie filling bits. The fried potato thing in the turducken burger was delicious; tasted like a latke. Which I guess it essentially was. This burger came with sweet potato fries by default; we weren't fans of their rendition - they were actually shale-hard all the way through, not crisp with a moist interior like a fry should be. Regular fries were a little better but were so salty they were basically salt licks.

My duck burger was not bad but it's a sin to cook duck beyond medium rare and this duck was medium well. Maybe they're afraid to undercook it because it's ground poultry but it's safe if they use sanitary practices behind the scenes... Afraid to think of what might be going on back there if they're so concerned. I saw a pic of a pretty pink burger that was labeled \"medium well\" so they're obviously clean enough though, since ground beef has the same issue.

The bun to burger ratio was way off on the burgers, leaving each mouthful dry and bread-heavy. We both ended up pulling off the top bun and eating the thing open-faced. Which brings me to my next comment: these burgers are messy! While not a deal-breaker, it is something to consider when choosing what to wear to eat here.

I did like that you could sub out different ice cream flavors in the shakes. The \"I'm Nutellen\" (Nutella, double fudge brownie) with chocolate ice cream was delicious but sweeted me out after 2 sips. The glass was rimmed with rock sugar pasted on with extra Nutella, giving it a fun and upscale but messy presentation. I didn't realize no one had posted a picture of this so I belatedly snapped one after drinking most of it. I agree that the fake whipped cream was a letdown. Bobby's Burger Palace shakes use real whipped cream.

Would have gone back to Bobby's for burgers if we weren't already in the Mirage to see the Beatles, but even Bobby's can't compare to Lucky Devil's kobe beef burgers in DTLA. ;_;"}
{"text":"Disappointed. Late night stop & several Mirage restaurants were closed. Being vegetarian my options were limited so a veggie  burger it is. I'm not exaggerating when I say it was like they scooped a big helping of goulash on to my bun. There was no structure to it and it was mushy and bland. The fries were soggy like maybe they lingered under the heat lamp a while. My husband's turkey burger was satisfactory but certainly not outstanding. My daughter ordered spinach dip and it tasted like spinach mixed with cream. It was lacking any sort of cheese or onion flavoring and the chips were stale. The saving grace was my husband's shake (great). I asked them to make me a spiked root beer float & the waitress pleasantly said she could. But the $18.50 price tag for the float soured that experience as well. 

We checked out this morning and decided to at least have a conversation with the manager instead of complaining online. My husband explained  to Saka, the manager in detail how our food was served. My husband asked if they would please adjust that portion of the bill before we checked out and reiterated that the service was just fine. It felt like a scripted response with no real enthusiasm for correcting our experience. He said if we had talked to him that night he might have been able to do something for us. My husband explained it was very late and close to closing time with very little staffing in the restaurant. My husband was frustrated that the manager wasn't concerned about the quality of his product only that he was not making any adjustments to the bill. So with that said since he isn't going to listen I've decided to tell all of you. We're not going back. I hope your experience is a better one."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar it took 20 mins just to get some pickles and it was a slow night.  Service was really slow and the staff wasn't very friendly. ( Raul was our servicer)"}
{"text":"This place is a good little sports/burger bar.

Burgers, wings, and fires are all good and the service is friendly. We go here every time we're in Vegas for a quick easy late night meal."}
{"text":"More of a 3.5 star visit.  Service was good and friendly.  I showed up just before closing time so everyone was chill.  Food was decent.  I tried the duck burger and it was ok.  It did not blow me away but it was not bad either.  I liked that they carried some local micro-brews.  I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Not terrible but not great. We had just checked in and dropped off our luggage in the room after an early morning flight so we were starving. After a quick circuit around the Mirage, we settled on LVB Burgers. I had the AAA burger which comes with boursin cheese (a soft cheese with garlic herb), sun dried tomatoes, applewood smoked bacon, and arugula. It filled my stomach but didn't quite hit the spot. The host and waitress were friendly and the atmosphere is nice like an upscale sports bar. But we waited a very long time for the food to come out after our order. It was around noon but the place was not busy."}
{"text":"My husband and daughter enjoyed their burgers and chocolate shakes. I had the onion rings and it was okay. We were seated right away and service was just average. Prices are what you would expect at these hotel restaurants."}
{"text":"I just went to this restaurant after going a few times before in the past. I had previously had really good experiences but tonight was really poor. I got a crispy chicken sandwich that I showed to the staff and they told me it was crispy when it was just burnt chicken skin on the outside. It was also really dry. My friend ordered a burger that wasn't cooked all the way through. Our bill for three people was $85 without a tip. The one Silverlining was our server was nice as was the host. Still, I was very disappointed with the quality of the food especially at that price."}
{"text":"Their burger was completely raw inside. It was literally red mushy uncooked meat. NOT to be confused with rare or medium rare. Flat out uncooked and pretty sure violates health codes. You guys have \"burgers\" in your restaurant name how is this possible! No apology from the waiter either. Don't come here!"}
{"text":"This was a terrible burger for my taste. It was the Mushroom/Swiss burger. The mushrooms were way overpowering for the burger itself. The fries were only warm & the server was nothing short of miserable. Not smiles, greetings or recommendations. Just came to the table & blandly asked \"what would be our like\". Too many restaurants in Las Vegas to accept this type of food & service. Go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Are last night in veal at  the Mirage . I wanted us to have great dinner . I was thinking Tom Heritage steakhouse and we went to it . But wife do we really want to pay that much .so  we chose to eat here. This restaurant was way overprice and the food was just ok..nothing special.82.64 it would not have been much more at Tom , I was very disappointed in what we got ..I had a Angus burger, and wife had a Reuben sandwich  and Fried pickles was just the out was no pickles really ..."}
{"text":"Had some friends in town staying on the Strip so we tried this. 

Burger was a 4/10
Service was a 3/10

But this was an expensive restaurant for being a burger joint. You get MUCH better burgers at Five Guys or Smash Burger for half the cost. 

This place is garbage. Mediocre food and expensive burgers = FAIL. Never coming here again. Won't recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"This was our first meal in Vegas and it didn't disappoint. My fiancee and I shared a burger and the Cowboy nachos which were AMAZING.  We sat at the bar and the bartender was quick and very friendly. We loved the nachos so much... A few nights later after drinking we decided we wanted a snack. Unfortunately we were too late. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Not knowing exactly what to expect we walked in and were seated. The menu was simple to read and all about acronyms. Lol. We were asked how we wanted our burger cooked, asked for medium and got exactly what we wanted. Done but pink in the middle!  Service was good, we had one error with French fries that were supposed to be onion rings which was rectified promptly. A very nice experience!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had a great experience here. Our server was super friendly and knowledgable, and our food was amazing.  Burgers were cooked to perfection.  We will definitely be back next time we're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"We were looking for BLT burger on the Vegas strip when we actually came across this place in the Mirage hotel on centre of the strip. 
At the end of the meal we didn't regret our decision to try the food out. IMO this place serves the juiciest burger in the country. 
I tried the veggie burger (PGP- not sure what that means), fries and shake combo- the meal was delicious to say the least and the portion size huge. 
The food is slightly overpriced but that's true for almost all restaurants on the strip. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Ever want to try to like a place, but you just can't?
Came here for lunch on Friday. Wasn't sure, but decided to give it a chance.
The good:
Cold beer. 
Nice lively atmosphere
Friendly manager. 
Manager took my order. The bartender was apparently \"busy\".
Lamb burger came out pretty quick.
Bartender gave a discount for the hiccups. 

The fair:
Slow service. Took a bit tor the bartender to say anything. Took a bit longer for him to get my drink order. BUT he did recover by getting me my beer fairly quickly.
Lamb burger was not seasoned evenly. 1st bite was amazing. Then all of a sudden, bland.
Apparently there was something wrong with the bar and water. So to get water or soda, took a bit of time. But all I could hear was the bartender complaining the whole time. 
Seriously, if there is something wrong, don't make the guests suffer by listening to your whining. Deal with it."}
{"text":"So freaking good!!! Great price amazing burgers, a stop I always make when I visit. Fantastic service and great people watching since the restaurant is located by a main entrance. 

I come here a lot and I bring my guests and they love it. 

Lots of burgers, I add more things to my burger like avocado. The price is great not to expensive. I can never eat desert after this dinner. So that good I suppose. Everyone is very friendly and they ask how cooked you want your meat which I absolutely love."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick bite. Compared to other places here, this is really fats. Had the chicken burger with the fries and milkshake. Pretty nice and delicious. Inexpensive place and located in the Mirage. Great service and very fast."}
{"text":"They say first impressions are the most important... with that said the hostess are anything but pleasant. Did not try the food because they made the start not so pleasant."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but it was just okay.  As it was very busy, I sat at the bar and could watch all these great burgers being cooked and assembled.  They looked so good, I really had my hopes up.  The bacon cheeseburger was good, cooked medium, with fresh bread on the bun.  But the cheese sauce was grainy and flavorless.  I believe that a slice of swiss cheese, hell, american cheese would have been better.   The sweet potato fries needed to be cooked longer as they had no crispy bits.  Just a disappointing meal."}
{"text":"Food was very good but staff seemed a bit short when we were there.  The mgr was settling a bill with a customer at the front desk (which seemed an odd place to settle a bill) but anywho, we had to wait for him to haggle with the customer before we were seated.  Mind you there were about a dozen empty tables and we saw servers walking all around us, but no one would seat us.  Hmmm maybe they have enough customers and our business wasn't that important.  

We were Finally seated nonetheless and the food was was excellent and the waiter was really nice and gave us good suggestions.  We ordered for the first time forever a shake which was one of their spiked shakes.  They were both fantastic! One with bourbon and one with vodka.  Mixed well, so the alcohol was not evident.

All in all it was a very memorable experience and I would suggest you try it out while in Vegas if you visit the Mirage."}
{"text":"Love the shakes! Burger and truffle fries were awesome. Service the first time took forever but they were very friendly once they did come to our table. Good took a little time to come out the first time but second time was way quicker. I would recommend this place! They have a to go area too which was quick."}
{"text":"Really cool atmosphere inside the Mirage Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip! They have a lot of options to choose from. I'll start off with my negatives; crispy green beans & onions rings. Both appetizers were not good at all. There was no flavor on either & they both simply tasted like grease. My burger was really good. It was just a little overly messy with cheese sauce, so it was hard to eat. My favorite thing by far was their milkshakes! Absolutely delicious. Also, this restaurant had amazing customer service. Daniel helped me with my to go orders & he was helpful & very charming. He's definitely a keeper!"}
{"text":"The short version: this place is meh. 

The longer version: I WOULD GIVE 3.5 STARS IF I COULD. I had an LVB burger with a veggie patty which was good. It had good flavor and definitely tasted homemade. Not overcooked and dry like some veggie patties can be. I had the waffle fries as my side which were cooked perfectly with a little bit of seasoning. 

If you're thinking about ordering the fried pickles, don't waste the calories.  Although the \"beer\" type batter is light, it still overpowers the pickles. Maybe the pickles should be sliced a little thicker. 

Although I didn't have one, their shakes sound and look amazing. Might have to come back just to try one."}
{"text":"Overrated. Simple burger and fries. Reminded me of Red Robin. Only difference is this burger costs three times as much. McDonalds across the street. Save your money."}
{"text":"Hate to say it, but a total suckfest.

First, the service is suuuuuper.... slow. Honestly, they should name a superhero after this service.... like Reverse Flash, or StopTime. Don't get me wrong, the service is very nice, just.... s.....l...o....w.......................zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.

The artichoke dip is a confusing cheese melt, and tasted like something a failed pizza chef experimented on with his pet guinea pig and sidekick hamster.

The curly fries came out like dried... um.... potato jerky. Waaaay below par.

The burgers were mediocre at best, complimented by crappy onion rings.

In fact, the best thing we had was a grilled cheese in burger buns.

Avoid this place like a bad-breathed date with poor hygiene....

.... but I suppose it works if you're completely wasted and don't know any better."}
{"text":"We were in the mood for some good old fashion hamburgers and LVB looked like it could deliver. We were pleasantly greeted by the host and seated right away. The place had a good vibe going and seemed to please our senses. The waitress was pleasant, had good service and good suggestions. The food had a good presentation and tasted great! the drinks were spot on. LVB Burgers delivered, definitely a fan!"}
{"text":"yawn. all that hoopla.... very little pizzazz.   
we expected more .  the burgers are decent... not fabulous... and the menu is so confusing. it reads one thing... and then the famous words \"for that its an added cost\" ....  please make it clear from the get go people.   i say fatburger or in-n-out gives you way more for your buc"}
{"text":"Things I love about LVB:

- Great food! Some of the best burgers in Vegas!
- I can see my food being prepared (if I sit at the bar).
- Great service! The bartenders are very personable and on top of their game!"}
{"text":"Overpriced food. No other way to put it. This place is located in The Mirage and while the food wasn't terrible, I just think that one burger without fries should not cost a whopping $17. That's a little extra. When I saw this I knew I could not waste my money on an almost $20 burger, so I got the Asian citrus salad. The salad was pretty good, but I've had better. The service was ok, and the waitress was always making sure the water cups were filled which was nice. There was a shake menu that I was tempted to try, but didn't. Overall it was a three star experience."}
{"text":"Somewhere I always visit when I'm in town. The food is always amazing and prices are pretty much on par with other restaurants on the strip. The service can be very inconsistent, at times we've had amazing service and other times the service has been extremely slow. Overall, I'll keep coming here and it's one of my fave food options at Mirage."}
{"text":"This place was so good! I ordered a AAA burger with no peppers and it was delicious. Burger came out how I asked (medium rare). Service was good! Our table got an order of onion rings which were just ok and one Nutella milkshake which was also very good. We got seated almost immediately. I would definitely return here!"}
{"text":"Got the blue cheese burger with the some apps this weekend. Went kind of late so there wasn't a lot of people in the restaurant, food was very good and better than expected. Minus one star for our server who forgot our drinks and had to wait for both times to receive them. The Mac and cheese was very good."}
{"text":"Man oh man, was starving coming in from the airport, walked in and the first place I hit was LVB. Got a good old fashion burger. Which was cooked to perfection, pickles were tasty and crispy and so was the lettuce. Bread was toasted well too. The meat was juicy and succulent. The fries were cooked perfectly and has the right amount of salt. I will definitely be going back for a late night meal. Good job."}
{"text":"We stayed at The Mirage this week and we were so grateful for LVB Burger! Ricky is an amazing bartender and was very attentive and sweet. We also ordered to go from these guys multiple times! They're fast and the food is delicious. Make sure you try the Boulevard Rolls!!"}
{"text":"The Mirage is one of my favorite \"oldies\" hotel on the strip, and usually I stroll through its casino and restaurant row when I'm in town.

I was with my daughter looking for a place to have lunch, and we read good reviews about LVBB (Formerly known as BLT Burger), so it was an immediate \"YES\".

We ordered the B.C.B. (Bacon Cheese Burger) and the A.A.A (Angus, Applewood, Arugula). Both were perfectly cooked and tasty, size was above average.

We also got the fries and the Stay Puft milk shake (Roasted marshmallow, chocolate sauce, graham cracker,vanilla ice cream). 

At the beginning we had some issues with waiter missing in action, but later he was attentive and things were good. 

The prices are on the high side, spending $54 for two burgers, one order of fries and one milk shake (taxes and tip included) puts it a bit over the top.

Recommended!"}
{"text":"This was the worst service ever! The hostess made us wait over an hour to get seated. Our waiter took forever to greet us. Finally he acknowledges us after helping guests that were seated after us, but he took 10 minutes to even bring our drinks back. Meanwhile, customers who were sat after us already had their food. It was an absolute waste of time. We stayed at the mirage and loved everything about the resort, but they should be embarrassed to House this restaurant there!"}
{"text":"Cheese sauce on burgers is hardly considered gourmet and is definitely not delicious. It was perhaps the most nasty burger I've ever had. Bun was cold. Fried onions were cold and swimming in a gloppy cold mess of cheese sauce. Even the bacon had an off taste. The onion rings were fried in a tempura type consistency that encased the onion and grease that just oozes out of the crust...disgusting. I do have to say they did remove that charge from the bill. 
The only positive at this restaurant are the servers. If I could give them more than 5 stars I would. Our waiter was a good sport when I asked why they no longer serve their famous milk shakes, specifically the Maker's Mark shake. Big mistake not offering these any longer. Well, our waiter worked with the server making shakes and they made us the shakes we wanted that were not on the menu. We tipped each one of them well for their efforts because I somehow get the impression they are powerless to stop the severe decline in quality at this restaurant. 
We will never return."}
{"text":"One of the best places I ate on my recent trip. The service was great and fast! We ordered a grilled chicken burger and beef burger. The chicken was marinated perfectly and juicy! I actually prefer that over everything else. Worth a try guys! 
Food was better than Guy Fieri's restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a great inexpensive eatery (relative to other choices on or near The Vegas Strip).  Located inside The Mirage Hotel and Casino, we were looking for a quick bite to eat at a reasonable cost as we were on our way to The Terry Fator show.  When considering between LVB Burgers and Bar against the other hotel restaurants (a deli and a nationwide chain restaurant), we chose LVB.  

We got immediate seating, and not long after our server, Will, came to take our drink and food orders.  Will was amazingly prompt with his service and accommodating with our special requests.  The food also came quickly.  Portions were plenty and justified the slightly higher prices (also due to being in a tourist location).   The menu boasts a good number of unique burger options.  We ordered the Turdunken Burger Combo and Salmon Burger.  Taste was good and on par with your typical burger place.  

LVB is definitely a place to stop by before or after a show you have planned at The Mirage.  A solid recommendation."}
{"text":"Disappointing; not the same. I have eaten here on every  visit to Vegas, always at the bar attended by cheerful positive service, but not this time; something has changed for the worse since my last visit. This time the hamburgers each of us ordered took FOREVER to arrive, served carelessly lonely on a big plate, ok but sloppy and not as tasty as before. When we asked the bartender why food was taking so long he said unpleasantly \"what do you want me to do, grab food off the grill?\" Fried pickles, previously a nice side treat, were greasy. Likewise the onion rings. Even the beer seemed flat. Chef supervisor pacing behind grill chefs seemed to be interfering in cooking process. We opted not to try new bistro in Ceasars, walking in cold to Mirage to eat at LVB--a $60 mistake. Wont be  back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, service is a little slow but the food is delicious. We got the LVB burger and it was amazing. Didn't get to try a milk shake, next time! I personally think the burger is better than In-and-Out burger. If you're looking for a good burger, this is your place!!"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. Made me wait alone in line to be seated even though there were lots of open tables. Eventually got seated and waited more than 10 minutes for someone to take my order. The wait staff all seemed harried with no system to help them manage their allocated tables. People around me got served.  After 15 mins I got up and left but told the lady Maitre D what happened. She just shrugged. This place is a joke. Stay away. 
I went across the way to Carmegie Deli and was promptly served by super friendly staff."}
{"text":"Service here was terrible but the burgers were good. Ate only 1/2 and was full. I'd say it's an average burger place."}
{"text":"We stayed at the Mirage for New Years, and decided to eat at LVB for our New Years Eve dinner.

There is a good burger selection on the menu (chicken, duck, beef), and I was happy to see that any of the burgers could be substituted with chicken breast for no additional cost. 

There was a group of 6 of us, and we all got different types of burgers (I didn't want to be rude and snap picture of there food, so I sneaked the salad in!). I ended up with a regular chicken burger. It was good, flavorful and satisfying. One person said there beef patty was kind of cold (hence the 4 stars) so I'm assuming hers must have been sitting out a while before it was delivered to us. One person got a Caesar salad, he said it was just like any other salad.  Otherwise, everyone was happy with there food. 

They also have shakes, regular and spiked. One of the girls got a spiked shake, said it was weak. All burgers can be made into combos (fries and soda or shake for an additional $8+).

Overall, good place. Cheaper than some of the other burger places around. I'll most like visit this place in the future."}
{"text":"Service was good, but a bit strange that there were open tables when we got there but the hostess wouldn't seat us because she said the manager would get upset because the kitchen was a bit swamped. We just wanted to sit down because we'd been walking all day and they said they couldn't seat us right away, even if we didn't order anything right away. 
Good was good but not the best burger on the strip."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers and quite the variety. The side orders are killers! Try the beer batter onion rings, you won't be disappointed. Splitting orders is recommended because the burgers are huge. Only knock is the spacing between tables (a little close to the next party)"}
{"text":"I had the AAA burger with fries and a shake. The most delicious and juicy burger I have ever eaten. Great service and great prices."}
{"text":"I wanted to love the food and got excited about the Southwestern salad when I read the menu. Our server wasn't very personable, but took our orders quickly. He asked if I wanted chicken or shrimp on my salad, so I ordered chicken. When my salad arrived it was served on a large plate and was the saddest looking salad ever. It wasn't tossed well, and it was pretty impossible to do it myself on a plate. There were like ten black beans and a browning avacado buried underneath a mountain of tortilla strips. There was absolutely no cotija cheese on it and low and behold when I got the check it was an additional $5 just for the chicken. Wish I would have known that as $18 for a salad would have bought me the nicer looking burger my husband got. I won't be coming back as I don't know how you screw up a salad...."}
{"text":"Gute Burger im Mirage!

Hier hatten wir nie ein Warteproblem, was aber definitiv nichts mit dem Essen zu tun hat! Wir saßen auch an der Bar, hier hat man einen direkten Blick auf den riesen Grill und seinen Burger...

Der Burger war Medium, wie er sein soll! Was mir nicht so gut gefallen hat, war die Käsesoße! Es war kein frischer Käse, sondern bereits geschmolzene und vermutlich mit Fett gemischte heiße Käsesoße, die ich nicht unbedingt nochmal brauche! Als Beilage hatte ich Curly fries, sehr lecker!

Auch hier gibt es, wie eigentlich überall in den USA free refill bei Softdrinks! 

Ich hätte mir noch gewünscht, dass die Klimaanlage mich nicht unbedingt in die Arktis schickt, aber so ist es halt!

Die Bedienungen sind unterschiedlich, manche echt auf Zack und manche echt lahm! Das wirkt sich natürlich auf das Trinkgeld aus, von dem ja gelebt werden muss!

Insgesamt aber dennoch gut!"}
{"text":"Asked for well done burger & got a pink burger! Sweet potato fries were very soggy. Disappointing!"}
{"text":"Waren vor 5 Jahren im BLT Burger und haben dort den besten Burger überhaupt gegessen, weswegen wir gezielt hierhin gegangen sind und feststellen mussten, dass jetzt LVB Burger an dieser Stelle ist. Ok, der Hunger war da, also rein. Leider nicht mal im Ansatz mit dem ursprünglichen Laden zu vergleichen, was die Qualität des Essens angeht. Für die aufmerksame Bedienung gibt es einen Extrapunkt, kaum war das Glas leer, wurde gefragt, ob man noch etwas möchte. Haben den LVB Burger gegessen. Statt wie bestellt medium, war der Burger leider durchgebraten. Die Tomaten ohne Aroma und das Bun völlig durchweicht. Schade. Das Eis für meine Cola, was immerhin 50% meines Getränks ausgemacht hat, war offensichtlich aus dem hiesigen Leitungswasser gemacht, denn die Cola schmeckte dermaßen nach Chlor, dass es schon grenzwertig war. Alles in allem kann ich keine Empfehlung für diesen Laden geben, dafür ist die Auswahl in direkter Nähe einfach zu groß."}
{"text":"It is okay. 
We came here during dinner, right before the Love show and to our surprise, it was not packed on a Friday night. We were seated right away as the place seems a little empty. We ordered some beer/wine which turned out pretty good. I ordered the spicy burger, which wasn't really all that spicy, kind of more like a Tabasco-like heat. The burger itself was delicious. However, the burger was stacked so high that it became nearly impossible to eat. The prices were kind of high for a burger joint but I guess you're paying for the tourist price. They also offer some spiked up shakes. Overall an okay experience, probably will not try again just because of the high price tag for a burger joint."}
{"text":"I took my mother to this place as she was in for vacation. They way the hostess greeted us was so pleasant and our server was Crystal. She waited on us with a smile the whole time and made sure everything with the order was correct. I truly enjoyed my food and mom has not stopped talking about this great establishment. It is a enjoyable environment with the tv's and it's not to loud where you can't hear the person across from you. I recommend this burger spot to any and everyone!"}
{"text":"Best burger ever! You can even do take out for less money. The take out burgers are a little smaller, very good. I highly suggest it. We dined in and took out during our stay. Great service as well. Enjoy! Fried pickles were tasty too!"}
{"text":"I really hate to say this I thought the food was going to be really good but I must say most of it was overcooked and some of the stuff that we got was wrong. I ordered just a basic cheeseburger and asked for it to be medium should have been a slight little bit of pink but it was dry and not juicy I gagged on it even with the condiments it did not help. after a couple bites I sent it back. We ordered a Caesar salad which was good and it was quite a large size so we could share. My daughter got an appetizer of sausage links or the little smokies wrapped in some pastry flaky pastry those were dried out and over cooked as well so she didn't eat those. My son ordered a banana milkshake and I ordered a Bailey's and Kahlua milkshake but we both got banana. When I brought it to their attention explaining I had ordered one of each but we both got banana they went back to correct it and brought me out two of the Baileys and Kahlua milkshakes LOL was I not being clear? I probably will not go back they did take my hamburger off the Bill thank you very much but my bill still came over $90 for three people little overpriced."}
