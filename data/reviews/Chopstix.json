{"text":"We always order Li mein noodle !and fried rice you can ask to make it ,1--5 stars spicy !great tasting !and the teriyaki chicken on steak !we love it !their eggplant good eating with white rice !yammmy !"}
{"text":"Back to three we go. They brought back the drink that they stopped carrying the time before, they made my meal properly unlike the time before, and this time I didn't see any roaches roaming. It wobbles in quality and reliability, but it's my local go-to cheap Chinese at this point."}
{"text":"The people here are great! I accidentally left my wallet on the counter and they held it for me until I came back to find it! How many people would do that these days?! So thankful for the honest people that work here. The food is really great too! I always get my Chinese food from here and after that I always will."}
{"text":"Found this place and been coming since they opened. Good food nice people. You get a lot of food for the price. They stuff the containers full. I even have enough for lunch the next day.
I recommend Chopstix for replacement of fast food. It's the same price and much tastier in my opinion."}
{"text":"Definitely the best Chinese food on campus. 
Biggest menu that I have ever seen, amazing hours (open till 3 am), always friendly and very fast 

Highly recommend if you want authentic or American Chinese food"}
{"text":"Does what its supposed to!  Fast delivery, freshly cooked.  They have plastic, not cardboard containers.

I got the Szechuan chicken, and the chicken was surprisingly tender, and the vegetables actually had some crunch.  Delicious.  Plus the place is open till three which makes it so convenient for late night eating, especially if you're craving it.

5/5 because it does what it's supposed to.  It may not be the BEST Chinese out there, but it does what its supposed to well"}
{"text":"A good place to go late night. Try their curry fired rice and won ton hou. It's very good. Can't commet on other dishes though."}
{"text":"Good food but this place needs to be boycotted. The Roach infestation is way out of hand. I went in today as my sick uncle can only seem to keep down the wonton. I ordered by phone so I could get out quickly. 

There were no less than 200 roaches. Live and dead. Counter. Walls. Floors. Moving. Not moving. It was like being in a Roach snow globe. I asked them twice what the deal was and they just had the \"I no understand\" face. Purely disgusting. I had to find a clean place to put the bag. 

Please let them know this in unacceptable. I've been going there for years and this is madness."}
{"text":"I ordered general tsao chicken and the spring rolls and crab ragoons the chicken was delicious and I'm picky when it comes to chicken, the spring rolls are amazing, the only thing that was lacking was the crab ragoons they don't look appetizing and they look a little fried to death, I wouldn't order them again, but I'd defined get the chicken again, and the spring rolls, if it wasn't for the crab ragoons I'd give this place 5 stars"}
{"text":"Amazed at how good the food is!!!  Ordered the ribs.  They were the way Chinese spareribs are supposed to be.  The Moo Goo Gai Pan was excellent as well as the Happy family.  This is as close to New York style Chinese food that I have found in Vegas.  Highly recommended!!!!!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, good selection of lunch special and always delicious! House beef and Singapore noodles are my favorites!"}
{"text":"Love this place i try something different everytime i eat here and i havent been dissapointed yet! Yummy"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Chinese places in town where I can get a consistently good meal at a great price. However, I have found that delivery is a bit of a gamble so I only do pick-up from them now.

I think I tried delivery three times with them and only once was it on time. The other two times the driver could not find my house for some reason and one of those times he was rude to me about it, like it was my fault he was late. I would have given this place a better rating if the delivery was better, but I do like their food.

Edit: After reading some of the other reviews, I'm remembering that I too, got a phone call and was asked to go outside to the car when I ordered delivery. Actually first the driver called and I thought it was the wrong number because I couldn't understand a word he was saying. I said wrong number and hung up. Then I got a call from the restaurant and they said they would call the police if I didn't accept the food. Then the driver parked on my block and wanted me to come out to the car to get the food. Sorry folks, that's not how it's supposed to work. You're supposed to bring it to the door. If you can't speak English, you shouldn't be in a position that requires you to."}
{"text":"Place offers really sweet tasting spicy labled food got the special lunch currently experiencing diarrhea its been a good 10 miniute event 
This is after trying this place
Wont be returning 
Unless i need diarrhea a few hours later"}
{"text":"Located in the Walmart Neighbourhood Market shopping center, next door to a smoke shop & Rosatti's pizza...it is definitely convenient. I can order take away, run next door to Walmart for groceries & return to pick up my food. 

I love great Chinese food & this place definitely does not fail in that department. I've been coming here for close to 2 years and they deliver each & every time.  The quality & taste are there. I've never had a dish I didn't like. Everything comes out great, not looking like soup or tasting like cardboard. I've even ordered off menu dishes a few times.  I have zero complaints about Chopstix overall, their food, or service. 

The starters are good sized. 10 fried pork wontons for $4.25. That itself is a meal. The entrees are a combo of family style plus rice. They also offer combo plates. 

It is family owned so its not uncommon to see elementary age children sitting at a table doing homework. The kids are well behaved & don't pose a problem. I only mention it because its not something one usually sees. If the restaurant is busy with eat in customers the children are moved to the back to free up space. 

The have fountain Pepsi drinks & canned Pepsi products. There's a tv, usually tuned to a sports channel. They do deliver for a small fee. You can order online or by phone. To be honest online is easier. If you need to say NO ONIONS, you just uncheck a box. No way to mess that up!!  The people who work there...their first language is NOT english & sometimes things are lost in translation. They are a no nonsense bunch & can come across as short & abrupt, but I find them to be quite nice & friendly. 

This is the only place I will order take out from. It tastes the same as if you ate there. They use the paper boxes & Tupperware type boxes so food is packed nicely. 

I love coming here & do so as often as possible. Try it...you may just fall in love with Chopstix, as I have."}
{"text":"Food is so good. Friendly cashier.  Will definitely visit here again. It's our 1st time here and we really like the food cuz they are so fresh.  Ordered egg foo young. Sauce was delicious"}
{"text":"There is a limited selection of decent Chinese food in my area so I decided to go a little farther away to try Chopstix based on the reviews.  Unfortunately the card reader wasn't working so the man behind the counter asked if I could go get cash.  The nearest ATM is in the Smiths across the way.  I went and got cash (paying an extra $3 since it wasn't my bank) and went back.  There was no one else in the place at the time and the same man behind the counter saw me come in.  I had my cash out and my food was bagged and sitting on the counter but instead of helping me he decided to take a personal phone call on his cell while I stood there and stared at him.  I continued to wait for several minutes and another man was at the counter doing something and also ignoring me.  Finally he looked up and asked if he could help me.  I said I'd like to pay for my food.  At which time the other man finally got off his phone and took my money.  No apology, no offer to give me a discount for my inconvenience, or even just throw in extra fortune cookies or something. 
The food was decent (wor wonton soup, house fried rice, and orange chicken) but it is definitely not worth going all the way over there for terrible service.  Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Finally a place that actually has \"Egg Rolls\" not spring rolls. Their food is really good. Lots of flavor and their shrimp lomein is awesome. Defiantly try the egg rolls with duck sauce. I would say this place has the best Chinese food in Henderson so far bases on the other places I have tried for Chinese food. You won't be disappointed here."}
{"text":"I had a favorite Chinese food joint in college and nothing has compared since but this place came close.  I have tried almost all of the Chinese food joints in a 6 mile radius of this area and this place is my new favorite.  Mainly because the texture and taste of the meats especially the beef in the beef and broccoli.
****update*****
My visit tonight was my last.  I picked up my food exactly ten minutes from when I ordered which was 5 minutes before 10pm when they close and was told (heavy avvent) \"oh you late. Last minute.\" I don't come here to hear lip.  Just close the door and don't serve me if you want to go home earlier than the posted time on the door."}
{"text":"So I'm usually a lurker here, read review but never write them... until now. This was my 2nd try at this place and it will be the last. While the food is ok, nothing to write home about, what I found in my chow mein was nothing short of disgusting. I could go on, but you know what they say, a picture is worth a thousand words. So here is my picture of what I unfortunately had the pleasure of having in my mouth."}
{"text":"I've only been here twice.

I've tried 5 of their rolls.
\"Las Vegas Roll\" - Not as good as Ra's.  I know that everybody bashes on Ra, But I still LOVE their Vegas roll the best!
\"Rainbow Roll\" - Nothing too special here, just a typical rainbow roll
\"The Journey Roll\" - Tastes similar to a Vegas roll, maybe better?
\"Matsuzaka Roll\" - wow.  Yum.  This roll has Prime Rib on the outside.  Yup.  Yum.  Really good, really different.
\"Samango Roll\" - 5 stars.  Mango/Avacado/Cream Cheese/Salmon.  I mean all of those things just MELT in your mouth.  I mean wow.  So good.  So different with the mango.  Love it.

I can't wait to go again and try more rolls!

The place is very small.  No liquor.  More of a take-out style place.  But to eat sushi, it has to be the freshest!  So I would recommend just eating it there...  Also, Johnny loves to make small talk and he might just be the friendliest person I've ever met.
But also though, be warned if you don't like to chit-chat, because he will!

It may take a while for your order because he is the only person there!  So also be warned of that.  It's usually very empty there, but the word will get out.

Had the Miso soup and was not good.   Tasted like Top Ramen.
Had an order of the side dish \"Creamy Lobster Rolls\" - Very very good.
Also the Spring Rolls were very good too.

I just wish they served liquor, and was maybe a bigger place?"}
{"text":"I love Chinese Food like really love Chinese food but I will NEVER AGAIN ORDER FROM THIS PLACE!! I have a very serious good allergy and specifically asked for that item not be included in my order. It even said the exclusion on my receipt!!!! Yet my order was messed up and the item was included! My options were to drive back to the restaurant for a new order or wait for them to bring me a new order at a time frame they could NOT narrow down. I asked for a refund and was granted that with the condition that they come pick up the order from me!! Really???? You need to come get my order before I get a refund?? Bullshit!!! I will never order from here again. Very unprofessional and not very customer friendly!! I could have had a serious allergic reaction and the nice and RIGHT thing to do would be to A. refund me and NOT make me wait around for you guys to pick up your fucked up order, or B. refund me AND bring me a new order!!! Neither happened!"}
{"text":"Good food, but higher on the $ for what you get.

I love how they deliver late, this has saved me many times when I'm pulling allnighters.
I usually order the orange chicken because they pack the box you get it in. It's good for a 3-4 meals.

Just don't save their rice after you eat. Unless you like eating hard dry rice.

Delivery time: usually 40-60 minutes"}
{"text":"I was very excited when I saw that a new Chinese place was open and that it is open really late!  Then once I saw their menu and saw that they have a tofu general tso's I had to try it. 

So I did and it wasn't all that great.  I am not sure how other general tso's are, but this one didn't have any broccoli at the bottom like other ones that I've had and the tofu was ehhh.  Some pieces had a really good crisp to them, and others were tough and chewy. 

The food is reasonably priced and you get a ton, but stay away from the tofu general tso's unless you really really like tough and chewy tofu and rice.  I know I will next time.

Oh, but one thing they do get points for is if you pay with cash you get a 3% discount, even on delivery."}
{"text":"best chinese food in the area. closest thing to new york chinese food. (i'm from ny). delivery time is fast too. good job chopstixx"}
{"text":"Staff was nice! Quick service!  Authentic accents!  Good food!  Still pretty new.  Clean inside! Fried rice needs some work.  But triple delight was very good!"}
{"text":"I have been getting yummy Americanized Chinese food from here for the last 6 years.  The food is cooked when you order it so if it is busy be prepared to wait for your order!  Most of their dishes are at least average and many are above average.  They make a really delicious dishes for all basic dishes you can find at typical chinese restaurants.  If you are looking for good food give them a try!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Affordable and very Delicious. I got the mixed vegetables and the sauce is so good. When I asked for fried rice instead of white rice they gave it to to me for no charge...I advise u to try this place."}
{"text":"I order from here at least once a week! Food is really fresh and always hot, everything I've tried is great. Ive never had to wait longer than 15 minutes, and most of the time it barely takes 10. I get wonton soup everytime because it's that good! I usually get orange or sesame chicken, both are great. I've had a few beef dishes and they didn't disappoint either. The portions are huge! The lunch special is enough for two people for sure and the family dinner feeds three of us with a lot of food left over. The people who work there are nice and the prices are great too."}
{"text":"Ordered from Chopstix for the first time today and believe me, it wont be the last time .
NY style chow mein was great.  We got chicken and roast pork chow mein.  Napa cabbage celery onions lots of chicken and crispy noodles on the side. They also came with a pint of rice with each.  The roast pork had lots of slices of roast pork.  

None of this west coast lo mein calling itself chow mein.  And there was enough for 2-3 meals! 

 Hubby got sweet and sour chicken with a mound of fried rice.  The sauce was on the side so it didnt get mushy in the container.  The egg rolls were egg rolls and not little greasy spring rolls.  And nothing was greasy.

It was delivered hot and fresh in less than an hour, just as stated

Only problem was I thought my chow mein needed more garlic.  Pop said his was fine.

We will be ordering from here again!!"}
{"text":"Run away from this restaurant if you expect your order to be correct.  It is impossible for them to give you what you order.  I've tried take out and delivery and every single order is incorrect."}
{"text":"This place gets 4 stars based on its value alone. We work around the corner and order takeout 2-3 times a month. They are always very friendly and for the $5-6 lunch menu, you really get a lot of food. My particular favorites are the General Tso chicken, sweet and sour chicken, and orange chicken. I probably would not get the kung pao or hot and sour soup again though. They were not bad, just not one of their better items. For basic Chinese food, this place is quite good."}
{"text":"Are you from the East Coast? Go here. Dark brothed wonton soup with pork wontons, not chicken soup with veggies.  Lo mein with flavor and sauce instead of parboiled noodles.

I can't speak for people who like/expect West Coast chinese, but this place is a godsend for those of us who moved here and wondered what was wrong with the soup, what cornflower was, why we got spring rolls when we ordered eggrolls, or why there are no crunchy noodles in the chow mein. :)

I expect most of the negative reviews come from people not knowing that the dishes here are very East Coast in style and came expecting West Coast american chinese and thought it was all just done poorly. 

Not that you know me, but I rarely make the time to review anything unless its just that good that someone else like me who assumes all reviews are paid fakes should take notice :)"}
{"text":"This place has to be one the worse places I've ever ordered Chinese food from... Will never order from here again... The food is horrible... I DO NOT recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Coming from the east cost I know the west cost has bad Chinese food but this was almost uneatable.  I was close to just dropping it in the trash can and going to some other Chinese place.  I have had a lot better at other Chinese places out here in vegas"}
{"text":"If you're looking for fast, and decent Chinese food this place will do!  They're quick at delivering and online ordering is super easy!"}
{"text":"Careful...they over charge you on delivery...I ordered from here and noticed it was more expensive to call it in than to order delivery through Yelp. The total price came out to be more even when you add tip...My guess is they are trying to charge tip twice. Once on the phone and again when they deliver it."}
{"text":"The place was okay. They do a great job of preparing the food quickly. It took them less than 10 minutes to prepare my $50 order. They do deliver which is cool. But overall the food is average at best. Personally I think Panda Express is better haha ( I feel gross for saying that)"}
{"text":"Very good Chinese food. The prices are low and the portions are high. I recommend this restaurant. They cook the food fast!"}
{"text":"This place is a joke. Everytime I've order the order is messed up. Now she said my card was declined and I'm showing it went thru on my credit card app. Don't know if they are trying to scam me...... I'm done with this place."}
{"text":"I've gotten takeout from this place twice now (szechuan chicken dinner combo and I must say I have been impressed. Not your typical greasy joint (although it has the same menu as one), the food was cooked to order with good quality chicken and veggies that still had a decent bit of crunch. You can sub the egg roll for wonton soup for 85 cents, so I did. It was yummy and definitely hit the spot The only downside is that the dinner combos are just under 8 bucks, which is a bit high... but considering the quality I think this will move up in the 'it's late and I don't have any food at home' rotation."}
{"text":"Delivery was late. I suppose out of courtesy I still gave the driver a tip. He really didn't deserve it however."}
{"text":"I would rate this higher but of late I am finding flaws in some of the dishes.  I have found that they do offer the best Chinese food in this town.  Believe me I have tried many Chinese restaurants in Vegas.  Either over-priced or just lousy food.  Chopstix also delivers as well.

Now for some flaws.  The hot & sour soup is very good but they need to add more vinegar for the sour flavor.  Most entrees seem to have the need to cook the vegetables longer.  I recently got General Chicken and the broccoli was really hard and chewy.   Needless to say I tossed that and just ate the meat.  Mongolian Beef not so bad but again the vegetables needed to be more tender."}
{"text":"(TL;DR DON'T ORDER FROM THIS RESTAURANT UNLESS YOU WANT UNDERCOOKED RED MEAT WITH AN EXTREMELY QUESTIONABLE CREAMY WHITE-ISH PINK COATING (PICS INCLUDED))

I've ordered from this establishment twice, both times ordering the Beef Lo Mein for delivery. The first time I ordered the food was decent for a late night meal. At over $11 for the quart sized portion it's not necessarily inexpensive.

The second time that I ordered two huge pieces of meat in the lo mein were unbelievably undercooked and coated in a thick, white, creamy substance. Please refer to my pictures where you can clearly see the contaminated meat. Properly cooked meat for scale.

I called the restaurant, complained, and was told to text the pictures and description of the meat to who I assume was the manager. At first, this person argued with me that the \"white thing is a bean sprout and the meat is just not well done.\" Clearly this meat is more than \"not well done,\" I would even call it UNCOOKED RED MEAT. What's more worrying and disgusting is that I couldn't identify the white-ish pink creamy coating on the piece of meat. After I argued this point to the manager he offered me store credit to use on a future purchase. No, just no.

I will never purchase from this restaurant again. I received a full refund after clearly pointing out that this meat was severely rare and contaminated the rest of my food. This horrible story does not stop here. The manager later texted me and told me the driver was coming back to return my tip and delivery fee. I told them not to come unless they wanted the food back because at that point I was done with the situation. The manager responded with \"We dont want keep your money thank you!\", and so I threw the food away. A few minutes later the driver shows up and shoves my tip and voided receipt at me and angrily asks for the food. I show him the text indicating that the manager doesn't want the food and am met with more demands for the food. So I dig it out of the trash and hand him the greasy bag, undercooked meat and all.

In conclusion, I WILL NEVER ORDER FROM THIS RESTAURANT AGAIN AND I SUGGEST YOU DO THE SAME. It's not worth the potential food poisoning."}
{"text":"Only gripe I had was when they told me on the phone that my order would be ready in 30 mins and I get there and had to sit my ass for 20 MORE minutes.......other than that everything was pretty damn good....the sweet and sour chicken was great...I'm sure I'll be returning even though I hate driving thru that busy ass shopping center..."}
{"text":"Me & the boyfriend Just order a delivery from here. I'm pretty picky when it comes to food especially growing up in An Asian family you should already know how the food supposed to taste like. 
Well the food was ok, it tasted decent. But to the boy friend it was pretty good.
What I liked about it was the delivery time they came earlier than I expected and the guy was nice. 
Will try again!"}
{"text":"Looking at the other reviews, I am mildly ashamed of my rating choice, but most of this review/rating speaks on behalf of the tofu dishes. 

I love tofu that is somewhat dry and crispy. I would not have known such possibilities in tofu texture existed if it weren't for Chopstix (kidding, It could have been anywhere, but as far as I can recall it just so happened to be Chopstix). 

Unfortunately, I don't remember the first day I tried the tofu here, but before that I would have easily given Chopstix 2 or 3 stars, because their meat game is whack. After eating their tofu, I think that what they have lost in meat cred has been regained in tofu merit. 

I usually order the General Tso tofu combo with spring rolls (I think the spring rolls are good too) and have also tried the Szechaun, Orange, Sesame, and Kung Pao tofu. I prefer the General Tso, Sesame and Orange tofu because they often tend to contain the dryer, crispier tofu texture I adore. 

The meat dishes I've tried aren't that great (i've tried the sweet and sour, sesame, general tso, orange and kung pao chicken); compared to other restaurants in the area, it ceases to impress.

Another thing it has going for itself is the fact that it stays open later than most; this gives the standard weekend drunkard no choice but to darken it's doorsteps (which honestly isn't that hard after a couple of drinks and if you like the dry, crispy tofu texture as I do)."}
{"text":"The food is nothing special.  Every entree has a very monotonous taste and the flavors are very dull. Majoirty of the 30+ Chinese restaurants around Green Street serve better tasting food, but a place that is willing to deliver at 3am deserves at least 3 stars."}
{"text":"Great portioning and always very fast , their lunch specials are amazing super cheap and yummy!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch. Cashew chicken not on menu, asked and they made it for us. Place was clean, friendly staff. LARGE menu, Large portions..."}
{"text":"Really? I just typed a heartfelt review and the app closed on me? Great. 
Chopstix is topstix. Hagd
I would use them for delivery if possible."}
{"text":"This place is anything but authentic, but it is the most addicting place to order food if you love Chinese American and you're a broke student. I seriously order when I'm 8 drinks in or stone cold sober. My friends have to claw my Blackberry out of my hands when I'm walking home from my weekend drunken escapade just to re-delete this saved contact. Too bad I know it by heart ;-) 

The only bad thing I can say about this place is that it opens at 4pm when I really would love to order it for breakfast, lunch and dinner. If I could tell the management anything I'd say to please hire day people and just stay open 24-hours... it would seriously pay off if there are more crazy people like me. 

Overall, order here and you'll get yourself a perfect batch of fried rice (that may not actually be fried but it's totally delicious) and some General Tso's Chicken without the breading... YUM!"}
{"text":"If you have PEANUT ALLERGIES beware. I said that I was allergic to peanuts and ordered Pad Thai - no peanuts. There were no nuts on the dish, but I had an allergic reaction anyway. This may have been from cross contamination of cooking utensils, I don't know for sure, but there was some type of peanut residue in my food. Additionally, the food was bland and oily. We threw it in the garbage on our way to the car."}
{"text":"Awesomeness!! Served me at the very last second...  Super polite and food was freaking great!  Glad this place is near my girlfriends house for those Asian style munchies! Had bean curd Tso style and the infamous Tso chicken..  Crab Rangoons were good as well... Will be back again!"}
{"text":"Yes there are a million Chinese take out places in Champaign-Urbana.  However this is one of the better ones.  When I am at work, late nights, they deliver and when you call there is always someone nice and helpful to help you.  Their prices are reasonable and the delivery people are very personable.  I generally order the Chicken Broccoli combination which comes with steamed or fried rice and an egg roll.  Their egg rolls are chicken and always nice and crispy.  I am a big fan of this place and have recomended it to my coworkers!"}
{"text":"As a native New Yorker, one of the challenges of living in Vegas is finding GOOD Chinese food. Chopstix is by far the best Chinese food we've had since moving here. Tastes as good as New York food and that's a HUGE compliment!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  The service is fast and the food is delish. I love the orange chicken and the crab with cream cheese wontons. My husband loves the steamed dumplings."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with my entrée purchase. Most of it was vegetables and hardly was actually the beef that I ordered."}
{"text":"I love this place.   They give you an excellent amount of food for the money, it tastes great, and they deliver!  Even late!"}
{"text":"\"Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.\" I went here for lunch twice in the last two weeks and never again will I visit this establishment. The first time I went I smelled a very bad odor from the cashier and was unable to fully enjoy my meal.  Since the food was decent I decided to go a second time a week later. WHAT A HUGE MISTAKE!!! I walked up to the cashier to place my order and once again that same dirty socks aroma came from the cashier. I understand people who work in a restaurant may smell like food but this wasn't the case. It's that smell you get from improper hygiene. Third times a charm? HECK NO!!!"}
{"text":"This is the first and only time I will be eating here . We came in and ordered general tso's chicken and king pao chicken specifically asking if it came with rice . The cashier said yes it did . We get home to find out there is no rice in our plate and they charged us $25 for just kung pao and general Tso's chicken with cream cheese wontons and NO rice . They even gave us soy sauce . To put on what ? I and not happy with the service considering they told us we would have rice and we did not get rice. We will not be coming back ."}
{"text":"Yeah come here if you want completely tasteless friend rice and Mongolian beef with about 10 pieces of meat and the rest onions for about $14."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time last night & had the Seafood Delight and it was delicious. I'd definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"I ordered a very amount of party trays for an office dinner, and I was very pleased with everything. The food arrived right on time, and it was hot and fresh and delicious. Fen was very thorough and helpful. The price was right for feeding an army of hungry people, and I'll definitely be using them in the future!"}
{"text":"This restaurant provided what I thought was great food, delivered in a timely fashion or so I thought. My food arrived and was piping hot. I ordered Sesame Chicken and combination fried rice. The rice was OK but the entree was excellent....UNTIL. I believed there was a string of sugar from the sauce but when I put the piece of chicken in my mouth I noticed the sugar or what I thought was sugar was flapping from my mouth. I went to grab it and low and behold it was a long reddish brown HAIR!! As i pulled it out of my mouth I was mortified! We contacted the restaurant to inform them and they acted as if what we said was an untruth. We originally wanted the food remade and delivered but after the attitude they asked us to bring it to them after it was delivered to us. We got in the car to take the entire $33.47 order back. The lady at the front desk was still in disbelief when I showed her the hair which was OBVIOUSLY hers since she was the only woman there with long hair. Everyone else was a Asian male with short black hair. Note: No one was wearing a hair net. I asked for my money back. She returned it with a half hearted apology. I will never be back!"}
{"text":"Basically a takeout place.  Dined in on styrofoam plates and plastic forks.  Chicken and string beans had flavor but EXTREMELY salty.  Sweet and Sour Chicken was tasteless.  Crispy noodles that are normally served when you first sit down tasted and looked  like they were made of corn.  We left most of our food.  Will never go back.  

It was busy so some people like it.  Lol."}
{"text":"Generally I come here for a quick something when the fridge is empty.  I always get the General Tso's.  It's made correctly.  Not some cheap ketchup based sauce you can experience at many other places."}
{"text":"This place is the best in the area...if your craving for Chinese
 Food. Every other place in this area is horrible!  I ordered the orange chicken,chicken wings, Mongolian beef and hot and sour soup... It all was ok..that's it...ok... Don't get the hot and sour soup... It was a disappointment. Everything else was ok... There was not a ton of flavor but enough to reflect what the dish is suppose to be.I will order from here again, if I'm in the mood for Chinese bc it's the only place in this area that taste ok..."}
{"text":"We order pick up and delivery from this location often. They retain a record of our past orders so it is easy to reorder what we like as well as add on and try new dishes. Great food, fair prices and fast delivery. This is our go to for Chinese take out."}
{"text":"Pretty good.  Not too pricey,  good portions, clean restaurant, friendly staff.  Had the family dinner A. Deff enough for 3."}
{"text":"Great food and great price. Got the beef broccoli and the beef was very tender. Definitely will come again. It's closer to.my house than Panda Express."}
{"text":"Excellent! Everything tastes super fresh. Very awesome prices for such great takeout. I'll definitely be back. Thank you."}
{"text":"Chopstix is the type of restaurant that serves food only edible for intoxicated people.
The place is very expensive for what they serve. Its around 6 bucks for a small pint of fried rice. I once made the mistake of eating half of my order and storing the other half in my fridge. When I woke up, the rice congealed into a disgusting looking blob and there was a pool of chili oil in my fridge. If you like to eat grease and rice then this is the place for you, otherwise I'd pass.

The only good thing about Chopstix is their willingness to delivery until around 3 am."}
{"text":"Great food fast delivery ! Love the specials best beef and broccoli and orange chicken.  The egg rolls need work but everything else is great"}
{"text":"Very good not on menu but I order mongolian chicken. Delicious. The spring rolls are excellent too. I need to try something else but this is my favorite and its spicy."}
{"text":"Was happy to see Chopstix in area. We are regulars. Priced reasonable and quick delivery during non peak times. Good food as expected."}
{"text":"Easy online ordering. On time and accurate delivery.  .for the price sizes are great and quality is good. If you complain you are too picky..."}
{"text":"Service is great! Prices are crazy though, in my personal opinion two entrees and an order of pan fried dumplings for $27 is kind of a shocker. The food is good but it's not $27 good. Very nice customer service."}
{"text":"All I get is the house fried rice, but that's just me. Family gets all the rest. Great service."}
{"text":"So I tried this place out with the bf the other day after searching on Yelp. They claim to be \"New York Style Chinese Food\"...not really sure what that means. They DO give you a lot of food. I was able to eat 3 meals out of the food I bought.

General Tso's Chicken - good, tasted like Orange Chicken
Chicken with Garlic Sauce - good
Pork Fried Rice - bland and dry
Vegetable Egg Roll - nothing special

A big plus is that your food is made to order, unlike Panda Express where the food is already prepared and they just scoop it into containers. The food definitely tasted like it was just made, with exception to the fried rice, which was dry.

The food wasn't the worst, but it wasn't the best. Not too sure if I'll be back. The bf enjoyed his food more than I did, so if I do return, it'll be for him."}
{"text":"My co-workers ordered from here all the time for lunch meetings & I absolutely love it. The food is delicious & they over-stuff the aluminum to-go trays. 

NOW, here's the reason I lowered my stars.(the food deserves 5 stars by the way)

I decided to take my family there for a dine-in dinner last night(12-23-2010). My family of 4 were the only people there other then the staff/family of the staff. Our menus were brought out, drinks brought out, took our order(which was the Family B $29.99 w/egg drop soup, chicken wings/crab wontons/eggrolls appetizers,  combo fried rice, orange chicken(medium heat), & triple delight. The soup came out in a family bowl, no ladle. No big deal, I just went up to the counter & asked for one. Appetizers came out, still going good. 2 entrees came out, fresh & hot, lovely. No rice. We waited about 10 mins, no one was in the kitchen, only the children wrapping utensils were up front, the older man was outside talking on his cell phone smoking a cig. No one came to check on us, no refills were given or even asked if we would like one. My husband decided to just have them box it for to-go. He went up to the counter & the lady asked \"what would you like to order?\" He explained to her that he was from that table(pointed to us, & remember no one else was in there), would like a to-go box for the leftovers, the bill, & also can we get our rice to-go since it was never brought out. She asked him if he was \"sure\" it didn't come out, she went to talk to someone in the far back  to double check & said that we didn't order rice.  CLEARLY the family combo has it listed on their menu & the order note pad showed it was written down by the waitress. She then put the order in, it took only a few minutes to make, we paid & when I asked if they deliver to our area, she just said \"don't know\". There were no \"Thank Yous\" or \"Come Agains\"..just the exchange of change & straight to answering the phones.  IF you do choose this place to eat, I HIGHLY suggest take out/delivery(that's what I'm doing for now on.)

 Like I said @ the beginning, the food is 5 stars but the lack of a simple acknowledgment leaves a very bitter taste."}
{"text":"Great food and decently priced. Similar to a Panda Express if you've ever had that. Food was pretty slow and there wasn't a garbage to throw out stuff away."}
{"text":"Chopstix has been my go-to carryout for six years. On my recent visit, though, their product had slipped into the ranks of flavorless food similar to lots of other carry out places: strange seasonings; fat, tendon pieces and a few bone fragments in the chicken; pools of grease. The order was correct and ready on time, but I'm now looking for a replacement restaurant."}
{"text":"We ordered from here for delivery. It came in 45 minutes like they said it would. Was very easy to order straight from yelp on my phone. Food was pretty good. Loved the chicken lo mein and sweet and sour chicken! Mongolian beef and kung pao chicken were a little bland. Maybe because I ordered them mild assuming they would be too spicy otherwise. But can't fault them for following the order to a \"T.\" Overall we will definitely order again! We got a lot of food for our money and I really want to try some chef specials next time!"}
{"text":"Excellent quality for Chinese takeout - Pad Thai is fantastic; as was Mu Shu Pork & General's Chicken."}
{"text":"What a deal! $20 for soup, shrimp with walnuts, sweet and sour chicken combos. Great food, great flavor, and the lady that took my order to-go was very friendly. Plus it only took about 12 minutes to cook. So much better than Panda Express, if you consider that Chinese food. We'll definitely be back for another quick order."}
{"text":"I spent 10 bucks (plus delivery and tip) for the Kung pao beef. I got maybe $2 worth of beef at most. It was literally 80 percent vegetables. Like are you kidding me? Did they not have beef left or what? The biggest waste of money When It comes to food in cu. Beef was OK. The vegetables (that made 80 percent of the meal) were honestly crap and distasteful. Please go online and order from Any of the other countless Chinese delivery places. They are ALL better."}
{"text":"This is a big no for my taste buds.  Down the street you can go to China Go Go and eat good quality & yummy food.

Pineapple shrimp is a joke and it should be a dessert....and Mongolian beef is below average.  

One and done with this place."}
{"text":"Try Ho Fun or Low Mein! They are so good! You can ask them to make your food spicy in level 1-5. Level 1 is perfect, not too spicy but adds up more taste to the food. Chopstix is perfect for dinner or late night if you do not feel like going out or low on budget. At least all the food that I've ordered has been good."}
{"text":"Food was just fair. Would not choose to eat there again. And for the cost was disappointed"}
{"text":"Their egg foo young the best I've ever had! Wishing they had a location near the strip or on the southwest side of town!"}
{"text":"Ordered the honey walnut shrimp, to go. I live 4 minutes away, so once I got home ate my honey walnut shrimp and in a matter of another 4 minutes I was throwing up like the exorcist. This occurred months back but if you want to chance it, go for it!"}
{"text":"The driver was courteous and professional, he smiled and gave me eye contact.  The best part, it was delivered within 35 minutes when I was given an estimate of 45 minutes to an hour.  The food was hot and tasted downright delicious!"}
{"text":"Being new to Vegas I've been searching for a good Chinese place. I've been disappointed until I tried this place out. They have lunch specials and they serve you a good amount of food for the price. The service was great and the food was great. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"On time and warm delivery, generous proportions, exact quality to be expected for price."}
{"text":"When this place first opened up, I was confused because there are already like half a dozen Chinese restaurants on or around the U of I campus. So I wondered how they would be able to compete.

Here's how. They deliver and they deliver late. If you want food at like 1 am, they'll bring it to you. I don't think any of the other ones do. And this place has cheap prices for pretty decent food. It's not like authentic authentic but it gets the job done. And it's still more Chinese than panda express. 

I always get the crab ragoons. I like how it's not traditional and they roll them differently. And the beef and broccoli is always a good choice. pay cash and they give you like a 30 cent discount too!"}
{"text":"The food isn't so great. The rice was cold and hard, noodles were over cooked. The honey walnut shrimp had too much batter on it and wasn't cleaned properly (mmmm shrimp poop). The lettuce and mayo sauce they put on the dish was just weird. The spring rolls were decent. 
The bathroom doors and light switches were so dirty they were black. In general the place didn't seem very clean and the food gave me stomach cramps...."}
{"text":"the best chinese resturant in las vegas.    true east coast style"}
{"text":"So far I have only invested in Chopstix's delivery service. As a vegan, I am content with the variety of tofu dishes offered, as well as the choice to either order a large entree or to go with a combo meal. Sometimes the deliverer of my goods has called me to inform me that the car is outside my dorm--this is after me not able to hear anything on the other side of the line--and the car is not, in fact, waiting there.

I would personally advise against ordering the spicier dishes because my experience with those orders is over-filled with red pepper flakes instead of a variety of specs that add kick. Maybe I just don't order spicy Chinese food often enough to know better. Nevertheless, I have been very satisfied with my sesame tofu, regardless of the fact that it doesn't come with veggies in the combo platter, and I always have received more than one fortune cookie."}
{"text":"Total shit place. Good is way too salty.  Had to return a meal back for them to remake bc it was so salty but all they did was reheat it and send it back to me.  I asked for a refund and left.  Don't eat here!"}
{"text":"I'm happy to say that there is finally a Chinese place a block away from me -- no more having to schlep all the way to Windmill or wait for the delivery guy to arrive...I got my own!

There is definitely a dearth of Chinese restaurants in Las Vegas, so anytime a new one opens -- no matter how commercialized -- my insides perk up with excitement. This location is still ironing out some kinks -- their credit card machine was having some trouble, but that's to be expected.

They have good combination specials. On their grand opening, I got two of them -- yes I can be a piggy. I ordered the Shrimp and Snow Pea combination to eat there and the Mongolian Beef combination to-go. Both combinations came with fried rice, an egg roll and a fortune cookie.

The Shrimp and Snow Pea is pretty good -- light on the shrimp, but definitely heavy on flavor. I would definitely order this again. The vegetables (snow peas, carrots, celery, bean sprouts) that accompany the shrimp was really good!

The Mongolian Beef was okay. That's a tepid okay. I might order this again, but probably not. I was expecting savory and spicy, but tasted more sweet notes than anything. Once I accepted that I was in for a sweet ride, I realized that they really went heavy on the onions and bell peppers. I like the onions (especially the customary green onions) but would have preferred if they refrained from drowning my beef in bell peppers -- just because it's the right color, doesn't mean it's a welcomed flavor profile. Like the shrimp order, this was also fairly light on the protein.

Overall I like this place. For convenience sake I will be back here fairly often. Yay Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Great place. Only place in E.Mesa to get pho and its good here. Johnny, the owner, is awesome, always smiling and friendly, running the place by himself. The rest of the menu is a mix of japanese/vietnamese/asian. They have a full on sushi menu, 1$ per piece nigiri, or sets and trays that are cheap and delicious. Next time in here I'm gonna get the tsunami, a tray made up of about 5-6 different rolls for 26$. The one low point is that they don't serve boba anymore. He said the demand just wasn't there. Too bad, I'll have to drive all the way to chandler to get that."}
{"text":"Place on Silverado Ranch Blvd tastes like they stir-fry using axle grease. Yucky, rancid and stale."}
{"text":"Seriously watched employee in kitchen rubbing his nose and eating. Never washed his hands as he prepared food , food was fair, after seeing kitchen in action, really lost my appetite . Says grand opening, I won't be back"}
{"text":"Don't eat much Chinese food. So I can't compare it or say I've had better. In my opinion it was actually pretty good. Placed an order for pick up. By the time I got there my order was ready. All I had to do was pay. It was Convenient. So I am sure i Will come again."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. Sauces were awesome, the pork chow mein (the mixed vegetables with pork) was the real deal. This is gonna be my new chinese delivery place."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Best Wonton soup and shrimp egg foo young ever!!  We just ordered it for lunch and all the girls loved their food also!!  Fast and friendly service!"}
{"text":"Do not order if you are hungry or in a hurry..we ordered at 8:20 on a Sunday evening and were told around 40 minutes...65 minutes later we called and were told they were slammed. Hard to believe on a Sunday evening. They then told us another 30-45 minutes. We cancelled as who wants to eat chinese at 10:15-10:30. Most disappointing as we asked them to call if it was going to be more than 50 minutes originally....needless to say we will never use them again."}
{"text":"Pretty good. I would not recommend ordering too late, or the food has a chance of not being so great. Otherwise, I enjoy the food from here."}
{"text":"The last few times we ordered the food has been on the sweeeeeeet side. We like more savory/spicy rather than the sweet style chinese food. I doubt we will be ordering this again :(
Ordered the General Tso's chicken (very spicy) it had a little kick but more on the sweet side. The Chicken delight was very sweet and had a lot of chicken (good for you meat lovers) we wanted more of the vegetables. I guess I should have specified less meat more veggies. The singapore noodles were ok. The fried eggrolls were very good."}
{"text":"Not a bad place if you're in a hurry and need some decent Chinese food to go. I usually order the Shezuwan Style bean Curd and add ground chicken for only $1 and ask for extra spicy and the employees are very willing to fill my requests. Great tasty food and great prices."}
{"text":"My rating for this place juggles between 3 stars to 4 stars. I actually want to say 3.5 but I don't want to leave them with just 3 stars so I went ahead and put the extra star but truthfully I go with 3.5 stars. It's a pretty standard Chinese take out and delivery restaurant. I use to go to China Dragon by the airport then when I moved to this area and tried this out with my girlfriend. They have good lunch specials and some cool coupons in the back of the take out menu when you ask for one. Lunch specials end at 4pm. My girlfriend got the sesame chicken and I got the honey garlic shrimp. It was tasty and no complaints is all I can say about the food. What made me settle on giving them the 4th star was because of the cleanliness of the restaurant. Overall, this would be my first Chinese take out restaurant choice in this area."}
{"text":"Fast delivery such good  chow fun and noodles. Fried rice. If you love Chinese it's very well priced you will love chopstix so good!"}
{"text":"Two visits. Both tasty, quality. Man, the wonton soup is generous with the 'tons ... and plenty of scallions, too!

But shortly after the second visit, I got hit with some serious stomach cramps. Maybe related, maybe not, but the timing was right.

I'll steer clear for now.

UPDATE: I see another review, dated just four days after mine, also complaining of stomach cramps. Quod erat demonstrandum."}
{"text":"Not sure if they were having a bad night or what! The general tso's chicken was very dry, tasted old and actually pretty nasty! The rice was mediocre. They forgot my spring roll! This was my first and last time ordering from here."}
{"text":"This place has quickly become the \"go to\" Chinese take out spot. The food is delivered quickly & correctly and with great flavor."}
{"text":"Stopped for a carryout of wor wonton soup.  I've been on a soup kick lately and have tried several different Chinese restaurants looking for the best.  Chopstix didn't disappoint.  The soup was loaded with different veggies and big chunks of chicken, beef, shrimp, and tasty wontons.  For $6.95 you get a feast in a bowl (actually 2 bowls)."}
{"text":"Oh. My. Delicious. Chopsticks really hit the spot tonight. My roommate and I had a hankering for Chinese food, so we drove around the corner to grab an order to go. We got the $23 family dinner and everything was so good! I am not even a little disappointed. 
What we got:
-wonton soup (just a little salty, but nothing a sip of water couldn't solve)
-two egg rolls (very flavorful!! Didn't taste like they came out of a freezer)
-Crabrangoon (sp? Tasted like most others, but texture was just right)

Now for the best three parts of our meal....

-chicken fried rice... get it! I was surprised at how tasty it was. Earlier reviews are right, it is good.
-sweet & sour chicken.... again, texture and flavor were great and the sauce, oh the sauce!! It make my list of favorites.

And the star of our night....

**Mongolian beef** 
Get it!! full of flavor with just a little heat. I will be a repeated diner based on this dish alone. If you haven't had Mongolian beef before, try it here. 

Good portions for the cost.
All food had great flavor.
People were nice.
Better for take out/deliver than dine in. 

Food pairs we'll with cheesy kung fu movies."}
{"text":"I apologize for my lack of activity over the past two years.  Once I found a few salvageable places, I exhausted my limits for self-deprecation.  I've been to many new establishments over the hiatus, but most of them weren't worth reporting (kind of like this one).

So I received a flyer from Chopstix several weeks ago.  Their $5.75 lunch specials caught my eye -- entree, rice and drink (or eggroll) included.  The picture of the sesame chicken looked good (as the pictures always do), so I decided to oblige.  First impressions: the lobby area was small and dirty.  I found the table with the least amount of discord and waited for my order.  When I used the soda fountain, I found the soda was completely flat, so I asked for a can (which is fine, except I can't get a refill on the way out).  Also, I noticed a distinct lack of air conditioning, despite the fact that I was under a vent, so I felt sweltry and sweaty the whole time.  

When I finally received my order, it looked good (probably because I hadn't eaten all day).  The few pieces of sesame chicken on top were delicious; crispy on the outside, tender on the inside.  However, once I got down to the \"meat\" of the meal, the chicken pieces became soggy and tasteless, doused in a syrupy mess.  I imagine this is what it must be like for anyone who orders to go.  I didn't even bother finishing.  At the end of my meal, I was even more depressed than when I came in.  YOU SHOULD NOT BE DEPRESSED WHEN EATING AT A RESTAURANT.

Based on this single experience, I won't go again.

I gave two stars because they seemed like nice people, and I don't want any business to fail.  They just need to step up their game a bit."}
{"text":"Good food at a good price and excellent service.  Just felt sorry the poor guy was holding down the whole place alone.  It reminds me a lot of restaurants in Asia and would highly recommend it.  Call in your order if you have issues with waiting."}
{"text":"love this place. right around the corner from my house. the general sho chicken is so good."}
{"text":"I think the food is good and we have been to many places  it makes a difference you can see in the kitchen best to take out or have delivered.  we find the food tasty we love the egg foo young  the sweet & sour pork so good NO grease we have tried many dishes very satisfied if you want gourmet chinese   then you want PF CHANGS PEOPLE if you want good chinese try it you will like it......"}
{"text":"We just returned from a 10 day trip. 2 hrs in car to airport and 6 hours on planes to nothing unfrosted and nothing in the pantry that looked edible. Not being able to face another pizza delivery I looked at the menu for this restaurant. I wasn't expecting much but was I surprised! Nice size menu with LOTS of choices AND delivery ($2.50 delivery fee..nothing..food pricing ranged appetizers $2.00- $5.00; entrees $6.00- $10.00 again VERY reasonable!) The food arrived within 20-25 minutes and each entree easily feeds 2 without apps and 3 with apps.  We ordered cashew shrimp-highly recommend- chicken lo-mein-awesome, and not to be missed apps BBQ spareribs, spring rolls and cream cheese crab wontons which I could've made a meal of alone! We have tons of leftovers and our bill with tip was $41.00. Made 2 very weary travelers very happy!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a solid spot for a great priced Chinese restaurant. I had the shrimp in garlic sauce and then honey walnut shrimp. Both were really good. I had the fried rice as well but was not a big fan. It was hard and undercooked. Noodles are spot on. Worth a try"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Good portion sizing!! (not like panda where they give you a mountain of rice and a spoon full of entrée that is a waste of money) it was so delicious! I got the beef and broccoli combo plate and the steamed dumplings! So good!! The only thing is you have to spend $10 or more to use your card."}
{"text":"Came here for the lunch special which is $6.25 + tax. I ordered the sweet and sour chicken. It was nicely cooked just wish the sauce was a little thicker. I also wish they added a drink into the special. The fried rice and noodles it came with were just ok, kinda bland. Overall I might come back for the lunch special and try something different BUT only if I'm in the area I wouldn't go out of my way though. The customer service was pretty nice too."}
{"text":"Out of all the Chinese take outs in the damn city I picked this one. Location was what made me choose this place,it's right off the freeway as I headed back to Phoenix.What I didn't do was check the rating/reviews. The man who took my order was extremely friendly and the place was pretty clean that's why I gave 2 stars. The food however, was disappointing. Everything was hot and fresh, but flavor was either off or lacking. I ordered the lunch chicken lo mein and my husband got the lunch Mongolian beef. His was ok, just ok nothing more. It seemed like a small portion in my opinion. My lo mein was pretty flavorless almost like spaghetti without sauce. I also ordered a hot and sour soup (they only offer 1 size & it's almost $5) and it was weird. Not really hot or sour but almost tasted like toast. The only good I can say about the soup is at least it had some substance to it and it wasn't all watery and thin. I love a good hot & sour soup and this was far from what I'd call good. Probably for the first time ever, I would have rather had Panda Express. I even passed one in boulder city and wished I would've waited. Bottom line, I wasted 18 bucks."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

Food literally is hit or miss but even the misses are still edible. We've gotten food to-go from here twice now so I'm reviewing based on that. Fast service and they include everything thing you need and more in your take out, from duck sauce aka sweet n sour sauce to soy sauce.

Spring rolls are pretty standard. 

I always get the egg drop soup, so addicting and served piping hot. Comes with fried wontons which I like.

The chicken lo mein was surprisingly tasty and addicting for something so simple.

Orange chicken seemed to have so much breading and the flavor of the sauce is of course different from your conventional Panda Express. 

Mongolian beef, again had decent flavor, but the problem for us was in the texture of the meat, as in it was chewy and some pieces were tough or had gristle.

I don't recommend getting any entree with just shrimp cause although the shrimp are big, it doesn't compensate for the quantity they give you. You'll find yourself noticing how much vegetables are on the plate instead. Nonetheless, the shrimp with spicy garlic sauce was packed with flavor and not too spicy but I'd definitely get it with a different protein.

Lunch specials are worth the price and can be filling plus it's till 4pm. We ordered the Family Dinner A today and for two people it was an overwhelming amount of food but great for the price and you get choices! I'd say it can feed three maybe four people. They give you the bigger size soup too"}
{"text":"I'm impressed , just received my food and it's all PIPING hot. Almost too hot to eat (for the soup) .. I got wonton soup , Mongolian beef and crab ragoons.. they got hit 1 minute within the expected delivery time and the food is great. Thumbs up chopstix!"}
{"text":"It's decent food, decent prices. Delivery times are a tad slow but other than that it's ok!!!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place!!! Tho we may not understand what they are talking to each other they are usually very nice to us :) Its a small place with a few tables. We usually get our food to go and have had them deliver to us to.
This time we ordered the lunch specials of orange chicken spicey with pork fried rice and egg roll. My husband got the cashew chicken with pork fried rice and egg roll. No complaints freshly made, very tasteful with flavors and filling. The cashew chicken has some vegies cooked with it (zucchini, carrots and celery)
By the way they do have restrooms for customers and they are clean..
We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"I never knew how good I had it living in San Francisco until I moved to Vegas and tried ordering Chinese food. This is the ONLY Chinese food place I'll order from.

It all started on Christmas when the house I just moved into had no refrigerator so cooking anything was not an option. It was one of the only places open and I thought why the hell not? Thank god they were open on Christmas cuz now I've found the best Chinese food in Vegas. 

I always get their hot and sour soup. They let you choose the spice level which is great. I stick with medium cuz it's hot enough that adds a kick but not so much it's inedible. It's got amazing flavor and they give you fried wonton strips on the side to add in for texture. It's got bamboo shoots and egg and to my surprise chicken. Highly recommend it.

Their crab Rangoon are sized as they should be, large triangle wantons, as opposed to other places in vegas that give you barely a dime sized amount of crab in a fancy shaped wonton. The sweet and sour sauce served with it isn't as sweet as I like so I just mix it with some sweet chili sauce I have at home. 

Their spring rolls are perfect. NEVER soggy and always bursting with flavor. 

My roommate consistently orders their fried pork dumplings (or something along that line) and swears they're some of the best he's ever had. Like me, he's a San Francisco born food snob so I'll take his word on it. 

We also order their chicken fried rice pretty often and it's always delicious. My gf is a very picky eater so she orders it without the onions and without bean sprouts, but it's always good. Never dry or hard like it's been sitting around. It's always hot and fresh and they use actual pieces of chicken instead of those fatty leftover pieces that most places use. 

I can't rave enough about this place. Don't take my word for it just go and fall in love."}
{"text":"I've been ordering from this place for years and today, after getting my order in just 15 minutes (holy crap!), I decided to give a review. 

I've only ever ordered delivery so I don't know how the in-house service is, but the delivery drivers are always really nice and polite. The food is delicious (the crab rangoons are HUGE and a little sweet which is my favorite) and the dumplings are the best I've ever had. Pretty much everything I've ordered from Chopsticks has been delicious. Best part? They're open super late. I honestly don't know why anyone would eat at any other Chinese place on campus."}
{"text":"It's a typical neighborhood mom n pop type of Chinese restaurant.  Not the best, not the worst.  The best part is probably delivery to the door.  There are times you just want some comfort food right by your door step.  You can place order thru their website, it works out very well."}
{"text":"The food was excellent, very friendly staff. Just be sure to check your to go order. Ordered sweet and sour chicken and they forgot to put the sweet and sour sauce in the order. Double check your order before you leave! Especially if they're busy"}
{"text":"Best place for fast Chinese food. I like the ho fun, mee go-reng and singapore noodles. 

They are open really late and deliver."}
{"text":"Delivery was early that's why they get 1 star.  Worst Chinese food I've ever ordered from Eat24. The Lemon Chicken was cripsy, but the weird, bright yellow gel had no lemony flavor.  The beef  chow mein was bland. I'm afraid to take a close look at the rice, after reading  the reviews  I should have read before ordering.  My first thought after eating a small portion of $30.00 worth of food (including tip) was to throw the rest in the garbage.  And after seeing photos in the reviews, it's going straight to the outside garbage can."}
{"text":"This place has the best orange chicken I've ever had! I used to like Panda Express but this place changed my perspective on orange chicken. You get so much from their lunch special which is 6$ and you get a drink! The price is unbeatable! Recommend it if you're looking for some Chinese."}
{"text":"Very convenient, Chinese fast food. Don't expect a high-end venue, this is more a pick-up / delivery location. I ordered the orange chicken and the crab wontons. Kind of average, for a very reasonable pricing. 
My order was ready in less than 10 minutes, which makes me guess there's a lot of microwave ovens and deep-fried stuff involved. But who cares after all?"}
{"text":"Good place to eat I like it, the staff was nice and the food was great I highly recommended this place."}
{"text":"Where to start... 

I am from the east coast, been in Vegas for 3 years. We have a seriously different view of what Chinese food is. This place is really true to east coast style of chinese. 
Like when you order an egg roll, you actually get an egg roll, not a spring roll like everywhere else around here. 

Also the pad thai is better than at any thai place I've tried. The only downside is they charge like $5 for delivery."}
{"text":"Cheap prices for the serving sizes (I did a lunch special), got to the table fast, and the food was hot. The food tested good but wasn't extremely flavorful, was good but not great (that's why it's only 4 out of 5). I would eat here again but wouldn't eat here everyday. If you haven't tried it, I'd go ahead and try it."}
{"text":"I don't consider myself a Chinese food connoisseur, but this hit the spot! 5 stars for everything- price, service, portions and food! I got all this food (see photo) for $11! You can't beat their lunch special for under $7. Huge portions- enough for another meal. Quick and friendly service. Now I wasn't prepared for the amount of breading/batter that's on the sweet and sour chicken, but it was still really good. Underneath the breading was huge pieces of white meat, and it was served with a sweet red sauce. If you're craving Chinese in Henderson, I recommend Chopstix! Quick, inexpensive and filling."}
{"text":"We love this place. The service is fast & the food is good... The best Chinese food I have had in Las Vegas period! 
We always get the bbq boneless ribs, the pork lo mein, shrimp with lobster sauce (yum) & wonton soup. And, for those late Sunday's when you don't want to leave the house. They deliver"}
{"text":"After I tried this place for the first time this past Thursday, I ended up eating them again on Saturday because it's that dang good.

Very small establishment and I ordered pick-up both times so I can't say how the dine-in would be, but they told me 10 minutes each time and it was definitely spot-on.  The food was piping hot (I had to let it cool down!) and the portions are very generous.  Their vegetable egg foo young has definitely won my heart - for whatever reason, it seems to be near-impossible to find a place that does it well in town.  Each patty is wonderfully crafted, the gravy matches it perfectly, and their rice is stellar.  Overall, everything works together swimmingly to create an amazing blend of tastes.  (Hey - sometimes it's hard to find all three pieces of this dish so well-made!)

The workers are super friendly and the kitchen was bustling like crazy the first time I went.  I said, \"I love your guys' food!\" the second time I visited and they got that shy smile and said, \"Thanks, we really appreciate that.\"

Not only is the food spectacular and well-priced, it's right around the corner from my house.  I predict many more visits to this place in the not-so-distance future.  -:)"}
{"text":"Not bad for if you're looking for some quick take out. Nothing good or bad to say. Just your standard strip mall take out place."}
{"text":"I have been eating here for years and if you read my other reviews, consistancy is key to a great place.  Mainly a take-out and delivery restaurant, but there are tables inside to grab a quick lunch.  All the main dishes and combinations are big portions and cooked to order.  Always fresh food, hot and at a reasonable price.  My only hitch with all Chinese restaurants that say \"New York Style\" is that they never have a huge pork eggroll like you will find in NY.  PLEASE if anyone knows a place to get a FAT EGGROLL let me know!!! The one thing Chopstix delivers on better than most every Chinese place in town is the fried rice ONLY if you ask them to make it DARK.  Then, it really is like NY Chinese.  I always order my fried rice dark and with no peas and carrots.  
Another hint for my East Coast foodies is order the boneless spareribs without the sauce.  The boneless ribs are awesome with the fried rice, but you have to ask.  So many places like to cover that good pork in that icky red sauce and I think it ruins it.   The Happy Family is packed with meat(roast pork, shrimp, beef and scallops).  It is a total value place with excellent food.  The egg drop soup is solid and if you like Moo Shu pork or chicken, it is off the hook!  Singapore noodles also rock. They are always friendly and VERY FAST.  If you are from the East Coast like me, you order Chinese once a week and it will become your go-to place."}
{"text":"I have never had an issue with this place. Food is ALWAYS ready minutes after I order and within the timeframe expected. Veggies are fresh and delicious. ON TOP OF THE FACT I can always share because there is so much food!!! I have never had a problem and enjoy the quickness of ordering online and picking up. The food is fresh and healthy compared to so many other places whose foods sit under hot lamps for hours and have so much added junk. I love it here and will continue to come for as long as I can :)"}
{"text":"The person who took our order and delivery guy were very friendly, and the delivery was quick and still hot.
We ordered the fried dumplings witch were very good and fresh. The fried vegetable rice, orange chicken, Mongolian beef and sweet and sour pork . All of the vegetables were blanched , and cooked perfectly with a crunch texture. The sweets and sour pork came with sauce separate so the pork was crunchy and delicious. Every thing we ordered was delicious!
Some of the best Chinese food I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Absolutely hands down the best pad Thai I have ever had... I got the house special which had pork shrimp and chicken. I think next time I'll just stick to shrimp and chicken as I am not a huge pork fan.  There was soooo much meat and vegetables and eggs I couldn't believe I had spending at least $5 more for Siri Thai down the street. Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"I was driving home from work when I saw a sign advertising chinese take out-- talk about perfect timing! Located in the corner of the shopping center, Chopstix looks like your normal Chinese take out spot with advertisements of lunch specials plastered all over the windows. 

When I walked in, there was no one in there. In fact, it looked like the cooks and the cashier were having dinner on one of the tables. I felt bad when they all jumped up from the table to take my order. They have a variety of dishes on their menu, but I settled on the combination plate. For $7 and some change, the combination gets you an entree of your choice (there is a list of about 10 different dishes), chicken fried rice and a veggie egg roll. In about 10 minutes my food was ready to go! I like that. 

Since my first visit last week, I have already stopped by THREE times! It is probably not a healthy habit, but it is better than binging on Del Taco next door. I have ordered the mongolian beef, shrimp with lobster sauce, sesame chicken and general tso chicken. The general tso chicken was probably the tastiest and it will definitely be my go to choice. As far as portions go, Chopstix is fairly generous and I can usually have left overs for lunch the next day. 

Chopstix is an upgrade from Panda Express-- and cheaper (and faster) than Pei Wei. A good choice when you're in the area and want an alternative to the usual fast food choices."}
{"text":"Food was ok, was made fresh, but the lady at the front counter was so unprofessional and had a BAD attitude, I won't go back. We walked in and she has headphones on, sitting down behind the counter. I didn't even see her and it took her a few minutes to even acknowledge us. Then we asked for additional red sauce, which she had to go to the back and get and seemed annoyed that we even asked for it. My money spends anywhere, and it won't be there again."}
{"text":"We ordered the family dinner with egg drop soup, egg rolls, chicken fried rice, orange chicken, and sweet and sour pork. I wasn't crazy about the fried rice because it had diced onions and bean sprouts in it, but everything else was very good. I will definitely go back, but probably get steamed rice over the fried rice."}
{"text":"I eat at this place about  3 times a week. They have great customer service, good food and reasonable prices. They also deliver!"}
{"text":"SUPER SLOW!  They quoted 45-60 minutes.  That's a long time to start, but it took almost 2 HOURS!!!  And when I called to complain they didn't care.  The food is not worth the wait.  Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I like driving around and trying some random place. This is what happened when I came here. I knew there were fast food chair restaurants in this center but drove around a little till I saw something I might want to try. Chopstix was my 2nd choice just because the first place I went to was a veggie bar next door which I didn't feel at the time, maybe later. 

Chopstix was clean, quiet, and had a nice view of all the beautiful people that were going in and out of that veggie bar at least when I was there.

What makes me a fan are their lunch specials for only $5.55. I went with the House Special Chicken with rice and a soda, which if you don't want the soda you can get the egg roll instead. It was good, can't beat a $5.55 meal. I love mushrooms there were plenty inside of this dish. The rice that came with the dish was different it was yellowish but I still liked it. If you get the House Special Chicken don't add extra soy sauce, it already has enough salt and sauce just mix in the rice. Unless you like it salty. 

Service was friendly and they do deliver. I would come back cause $5.55 is a great deal for lunch and the foods wasn't that bad."}
{"text":"First time I ate here was also my last!! The Food was extremely disappointing. Ordered vegetable lo mein that contained too much oil, hardly any veggies, and overlooked noodles. Dirty restaurant. Would never eat here again!"}
{"text":"They are consistently good, first time they've forgotten my brown rice but their Rangoon is yummy and the shrimp with broccoli."}
{"text":"Food was not good salty and poured with soy sauce! Got lunch special and very disappointing will not return."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery & it wasn't good. First they couldn't find the address (which sometimes google maps is annoying and does that) so not blaming them on that... But the delivery guy showed up and got an attitude with me telling me it was the wrong address still. He tried to point to my building number address which are two different things. Rude. 

I ordered the Singapore noodles and the meat looked and tasted weird but the spring rolls were ok. I also ordered Thai tea but it came in a can when I thought it would be fresh."}
{"text":"This place is a better option for take-out rather than dining in. The girl who took my order was on a personal phone call trying to pay a bill. While I was waiting, she was yelling at the cooks in the back in a different language.  Awkward! 

I have tried three dishes from this place.....

1. Cashew chicken -This dish was pretty good actually, with celery  the predominant flavor.
2. General tsao's chicken- Not bad, but terrible the next day when you are trying to eat leftovers. 
3. Orange chicken -- Good but not great. 

Overall, this satisfied my craving for fast Chinese food. I would recommend calling your order in ahead of time and avoid eating there."}
{"text":"We order from here often through grub hub. Delivery is always quick and I have never been disappointed in the food. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Orange chicken had good flavor but the actual chicken was uncooked! Honey Walnut shrimp had an awkward taste. Could only eat a couple bites before having to throw it out. Biggest let down of all was the Thai tea..... It came in a can! It was awful!!!! Nasty!!! Veggie Fried Rice was the only  edible thing we ordered. Altogether a huge waste of 40$"}
{"text":"The crab rangoon is SO GOOD. Probably the best I've ever had. Crunchy, creamy, tangy, sweet, so many textures and flavors at once but they all blend together seamlessly.

Anyway, I've been here a few times and every time I get the crab rangoon. I usually also get the sesame chicken since that's what my brother and I agree on. He also got the chicken lo mein this time around. All the food was good, and it was much lighter and felt much healthier than other chinese food places. I'm not sure if that's true, but I never feel fat after I eat at Chopstix haha. They give you more rice when you get takeout, but I felt like I had a good amount of steamed rice with my meal here. The entrees are fairly large too.

The interior is bright, clean, and colorful. There isn't a ton of space for people to sit, but it's comfortable. It wouldn't be good for groups/large families because of the space restrictions."}
{"text":"This place really try's to be a good take-out restaurant. At first impression they forgot part of my order however they acknowledged the mistake when I called so that automatically bumped them up to two stars. I wish I could give them more and say something like it was worth the wait. Then I would be lying. Pan fried dumplings taste premade, may not be but taste like it. Chicken fried rice was average lo mein way over cooked noodles and too mushy and salty. Genral tso chicken was nice minus the over done broccoli. The sweet and sour pork wax a shining star keep this from being a complete blast review. Their service is a 4 star. Prices are 2 and quality of food a two. Would not recommend this for delivery. Might be better if eaten in store."}
{"text":"Possibly the best General Tso's chicken I've ever had!  Also, someone suggested that fried rice be requested as \"Dark.\"  They weren't kidding!  

REALLY good.  =)"}
{"text":"This was a good Chinese food and I ordered from them before but never made a post but the only thing I will say that kind of killed it was the orange chicken ,it was lukewarm so I had to put it into my air fryer. But other than that it was really good food I ordered chicken fried rice, orange chicken, sweet and sour chicken, two vegetable rolls and cashew chicken. Since I ordered so much they gave me a free Entree and I got some garlic chicken something I never had before it was really good though."}
{"text":"Love this place and their food. Plus they deliver. Quick and efficient service. Awesome food!!! :)"}
{"text":"When we want good food and quick delivery, this is the place I order from. Love their honey walnut shrimp and egg rolls. They never run more than 20/25 minutes which is pretty impressive for local delivery, always make sure to tip your delivery man well."}
{"text":"I love the food here! Chicken Pad Thai is the bomb! And the service is always great and respectable. Fees like family. One of my favorite spots, the other being Stir Krazy Mongolian BBQ. And as far as others I see people complaining about the price, you get what you pay for. Good food does not come at a cheap price. And this place is great and won't empty your wallet."}
{"text":"Ordered the Beef with Garlic Sauce and it was so amazing ;) 
The flavor was delicious and the lunch portions are huge. 
If you get the urge for some Chinese food, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Great food, nice people, open on Sundays, super cool. Will come again when in area. My daughter loves the pot stickers."}
{"text":"Very quick delivery.  Usually 20-30 mins!  Food is consistently good. The online ordering process is easy. Friendly people. Big portion for little price"}
{"text":"it wad decent. i didn't sick from the food like the other people that reviewed this place so that's a good sign."}
{"text":"Good quality food with excellent value lunch specials! They are could about specializing your order..for example I ask for celery included in the chop suey. The only complaint is the large steamed rice at $3 is a little expensive, so what I do is cook my own steamed rice.
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Always a pleasure getting take out here. Amazing chowfun and general soa. Love the lunch specials and family meals."}
{"text":"Good food, nice and hot wonton soup for a cold night. Orange chicken for me, sesame chicken for him, specials w/spring rolls, and lots of rice too much for me. Just right amnt of spice in orange chicken. Most of the business was take out, we stayed, clean dining area, tv with silly game show. Only problem was when the door opened and the cold came in. Staff stopped by the table to make sure all was good.
I would return when in the mood for asian cuisine, and in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This is a little whole in the wall take out place by NV School of Massage Therapy.  Obviously family run and not a dine-in kind of place but its fine for a quick lunch.  

The food is really good and if I lived closer I would definately get it to take home.  Its near my office so I stop in for lunch every now and then.

Decent food, decent prices, and locally owned."}
{"text":"My wife and I really liked this place. It was clean and the food was really good. It tastes fresh.

We ordered pork fried rice and orange chicken."}
{"text":"One of the best Chinese take-outs in town. Reminds me of Chinese food back east. Friendly and fast. My fave is their crab wonton, fried pork wonton, lemon chicken, and plain fried rice. Husband likes the whole menu! Lol. Also deliver, though I've never used it but constantly see the delivery driver coming back and forth."}
{"text":"This place was awesome ! I wasn't expecting much because I ordered all the Thai food they had and it's not a Thai place. But it was actually really great ! Prices were extremely reasonable. Loved the pad Thai and the service was nice. Not a huge fan of the chicken curry but I will be going back and trying something different soon :)"}
{"text":"I really love this place!  They are the only place we order Chinese Food for delivery because we trust that anything ordered from their menu will be yummy!  We've tried a lot of things from their menu and have been absolutely pleased everything we've ever ordered.  They are fast and courteous.  My favorites are the BBQ Pork ribs (boneless), House Special Fried Rice and the Shrimp Chow Fun.  Try it!  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I ordered Sweet & Sour Chicken.  The chicken and rice was hot, but the pineapple and sauce was cold.  I've had much better elsewhere.  Last time I go there!"}
{"text":"Feels like this might be one of the hundreds of Chinese around campus open at the latest hours. Surprisingly tasty food, although I've had mostly only the soups and fried rice. No real seating inside, unless you count a portable table with chairs. Then again, I have seen some folks actually eat inside. I've always done takeaway, which was fine. A good go-to place in a pinch. Prices are standard and the quality is surprisingly decent."}
{"text":"We had our order delivered to our house. The delivery was pretty quick. The food was just \"ok\". Ordered sweet n sour chicken. The chicken was crispy and good but the sauce was watery and the dish was missing the pineapple, onion and green pepper.  Also ordered vegetable chow mien. The vegetables were crispy and delicious but the noodles were bland and greasy. Lastly, we ordered the house special beef.  Not so great. Lacked flavor and crispness. Had to doctor it up with soy sauce.
I might eat there again if I didn't have any other choices of Chinese places near by."}
{"text":"Sunday night delivery from Chopstix: Spring Rolls, Wonton Soup, Orange Chicken, Pepper Steak with Onions and Fried Rice!  Good price, fast delivery service and best of all: Tasty!!"}
{"text":"I moved to Las Vegas from New York a year ago and have been trying desperately to find a good Chinese restaurant. My husband and I are glad that we ate at Chopstix. The beef and broccoli is the best I have ever had with fork tender pieces of meat. Their shrimp with lobster sauce, chicken and garlic sauce and General Tso's chicken are also winners. I would just improve on their fried rice. They give you generous portions and it's one of the few places that actually have roast pork egg rolls that are bigger than spring rolls. I look forward to trying other dishes."}
{"text":"Tripped across this place while looking for something to munch on after hitting the Walgreens in the same shopping center. We actually went to hit the pizza place right next door, but we walked in there and it was a freakin' ghost town. There was one guy nodding off at a booth and no sign of any employee anywhere. If we would have stayed there much longer I'm sure a  tumbleweed would have rolled through there some how. 

So, we went next door and decided to give Chopstix a try. I'm really glad we did! It's a pretty small place, but there were only 2 other patrons in the place at the time.  I ordered the Orange Chicken combo ($6.95) while my friend ordered the Pepper Chicken combo(also $6.95). The employees were friendly and helpful. We grabbed a booth and within about 10 minutes we were served our food. 

Pretty good! The orange chicken wasn't as breaded as some other places (*cough* Panda *cough*) and tasted much, much better. My only complaint was that the rice was a bit stiff, like it wasn't fully cooked. Other than that, it was solid. 

One thing I like about this place, as opposed to other Chienese places, is that they have a fountain for drinks. None of that chintzy we-only-serve-cans shit. Although they do sell single cans, if you just can't help yourself. I'm not joking lol They really do selI single cans there! I was going back and forth between 3 or 4 stars, but this, coupled with the fact that I plan on coming back, made me lean towards 4 stars.

So, yea..I like it, I'll be back...so..

4 stars."}
{"text":"I'm a fan. 
Just know that at lunch if you order pork the dish will be made with BBQ pork. The garlic pork is not a repeat for me. 

My suggestion would be to have a family meal deal that didn't include soup. You know for white people who aren't used to soup with meals."}
{"text":"Talk about freshly made food!

Upon ordering, food is made according to your liking. As a picky eater who passes up on a few ingredients this is a PLUS!

Chopstix has become my go to place for Chinese food. The restaurant is friendly, clean and offers a number of amazing dishes. Luncheon specials start at $6.25 and dinner combinations at $7.25. My favorite is cashew chicken and wonton soup- adding some Sriracha gives it that extra oomph to spice it up a bit! 

This is not your next fast food joint that makes food in advance and keeps it warm under a heat lamp. - Try it out!"}
{"text":"so fucking bad service ?I was ordering food and they just hanged up my phone because of their horrible accent I can't hear clearly"}
{"text":"I was very upset this last visit.  The cream cheese crab wontons were horrible!!!  We also ordered lemon chicken and it was THE smallest amount ever..tiny, over fried pieces.  Not going there again."}
{"text":"Very good food. Great prices and good portions! They made my fried rice exactly the way I wanted. It wasn't over cooked  or drowning in soy sauce. The fried chicken wings were excellent.The restaurant was clean and it's close to my house. I think I found my Chinese food spot on the west coast. Yay!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese Restaurant whenever I want some good Chinese food delivered to me in the Henderson area since my other favorite is way in North town. I always get my food delivered from here, but I've dined in once. The restaurant is clean & food is good."}
{"text":"We ordered food for a hotel in Urbana and the driver called with an attitude saying he was waiting for us. We were sitting outside, and he was nowhere in sight. When we tried to explain where we were, he said \"F***you\" and hung up. In short, terrible customer service and terrible delivery staff."}
{"text":"Excellent food!  We're in town to visit family and just needed a quick bite to eat.  This looks like a small chain in a Strip mall - but it's really a family run, family recipe style restaurant.  We had salt & pepper shrimp, boneless round and pepper steak with onion.  All were excellent.  We'll be back again!"}
{"text":"Great spot for take-out or delivery in Las Vegas.  Sometimes you just need a quiet meal amid all the action.  Real good, consistent Chinese food.  Always delivered promptly and packaged to keep it warm.  One time we had difficulty with the driver finding our address but that was unusual in our experience.  Fried rice, shrimp dishes, everything has always been good."}
{"text":"Today, we ordered takeout from chopstix as we frequently have in the past, but this experience was so bad that I doubt we will return, and I encourage you to BE CAREFUL if you order from this restaurant. As we began eating, my friend took a bit of general tso's chicken with a STAPLE in it. After spitting out the staple and experiencing quite a bit of confusion we called chopstix to complain. They immediately denied that this was possible and told us that it must have been one of our staples (which had miraculously inserted itself into a piece of chicken in a sealed plastic container on the drive home). They demanded that we send a picture of the staple to their cellular phone number.  We did so immediately, within seconds of the requrest.  The owner got onto the phone and claimed that the staple could not possibly be one of theirs because it was \"curved\" differently.  My friend attempted to explain that this was impossible, but was screamed at by the owner and his wife.  The owner then told her that she would get \"IN TROUBLE\" if she reported this.  We are taking our chances and calling our local chapter of the Illinois Department of Public Health tomorrow morning."}
{"text":"This was my first time ordering anything from Chopstix and it will not be my last. I ordered the Family Dinner A and  selected: Orange Chicken, Sweet and Sour Chicken, Chicken fried rice, Wonton Soup,Spring roll (2) and Cream Cheese Wonton (2) all for the price of $26.93 after tax ! The portion sizes were generous and the food was delicious.

My kids liked the sauce on the Sweet and Sour Chicken it was thick and not watery. The broccoli that came with the Orange Chicken was steamed well. The rice had vegetables as well as the chicken and went well with both entrees. I liked the Wonton but there were only 2...sighs. The Family Dinner was a great deal offered something for everyone in my family. We even had left overs for lunch. 

Closet thing to North East  Chinese takeout we've found in the area. We will definitely be back to try other items !"}
{"text":"Went in to grab some dinner based oin reviews here. Sadly was greeted by one sign saying they were \"closed for summer\"
And another listing City regulations they had to bring up to speed.

So Hopefully he's taken the summer off to get the place tohgether and get some R&R, being a one man show, it must be hard. 
The website no longer works, which bodes poorly for any business.
I'll try again in September (leaving three stars to keep the average up, 
Even though I should give 2 stars for not keeping website up and saying closed for summer."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! My friend I went to this place for the lunch special and was pleasantly surprised. $7.25 for the entree which included a good portion of rice and a spring roll. The lunch special was $6.25 and included the same, why the price discrepancy, maybe cause the entree selections are different, but the Mongolian beef was great! Not too spicy and the beef was cooked well, not chewy at all. My friend had the beef and broccoli which was also delicious."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff! I've eaten at this location (Marks St near Walmart) several times as I work a couple of blocks away. I don't like junk, and a couple of my other favorite Chinese places to eat, here in town, are Cathay House (Chinatown, not Palms Casino) and Orchid Garden (Sahara). The other reviewers on this site that said this place has flavorless food need to have their tastebuds checked. Probably smokers. I love this place for what it is! Try the Triple Delight, Hong Kong Pan Fried Noodles, Dragon & Phoenix, Wor Won Ton Soup and/or Shrimp with Snow Peas just to name a few. I would recommend this place as a step up from Panda, easily, but maybe not quite of the same caliber as the other two I mentioned as those others are full blown sit-down Chinese restaurants with dim sum carts, etc. and more menu options."}
{"text":"Finally I've been searching for a Chinese restaurant that is similar to the ones I am used to and nov I've finally found it. Feeding is excellent. My favorite is the shrimp and broccoli. My mouth is watering right now just thinking about it. Also don't forget to try the beef sticks and the orange chicken. Both are excellent choices that you won't regret."}
{"text":"Amazing NYC style cuisine. 

Ask for their garlic sauce, hold the red pepper if you can't take spicy. 

I do the lunch special and ask for any special .... but I tell them use \"garlic sauce\"

The closest restaurant I found close to NYC style Chinese food. 

Addicting....I drive all the way from the strip for this place. 

Highly recommended!!!!


Mmmmmmm great taste and value (lunch)"}
{"text":"Don't Do it!!!! The fried rice was dry n pale, the egg roll was flavorless,  and the sesame chicken was just ok. The fried chicken was ok. Do yourself a favor n Do Not Eat Here!!!"}
{"text":"Chopstix has a full menu of chinese and japanese goodies, including sushi.  They also have really low prices.  Alas, maybe it was too good to be true.  While my sweet and sour chicken was standard, the sushi I ordered was quite awful.  It was not fresh by a long shot.  It was a good deal, but the sushi was a major let down."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed dinner here tonight. We got the Family Dinner A with wonton soup, 2 egg rolls, 2 cream cheese w/crab wontons, Mongolian beef, and sesame chicken. For only $23.00 this was a great deal and a lot of food. Everything was very tasty and was out very quickly. The staff was nice and the restaurant was clean. This will now be our go to for delivery. If you want fast, delicious Chinese, stop in and give them a try. We're glad we did."}
{"text":"Love this place, order from here all the time. Real egg rolls, great food and great service. Fried rice could be better but everything else is awesome. Customer service is good too."}
{"text":"Chopstix.. definitely a drunk food classic, but soberly I would pass. The food is overpriced for the portions, takes a long time to get delivered, and tastes very sub-par. However, the crab rangoon are the best in Champaign. They're huge, meaty, and absolutely delicious - essentially the only reason why I would order from there anymore."}
{"text":"The food is so so, i always order either the shrimp lo mein or the kung pao chicken. Never disappointed, Except for when i forget to ask for no celery because they use wayyyyyy too much celery in everything. Service is always good and the people working behind the counter are always friendly."}
{"text":"I ordered online for delivery. My food was delivered really fast and hot! Best Chinese food I've had since, EVER! I spent 45.00 and it worth the 120 minutes of my work week! Next time I will go and sit at the restaurant to eat but I've found me a new eating spot....."}
{"text":"This is really a one and a half star for it does not warrant the full one star.
Hubby wanted to try this and we got a flyer in the mail.  It looked really reasonably priced and they had a bunch of choices.
We ordered on line to pick up at 5pm to bring home. When hubby arrived at 4:50, the order was already sitting on the counter.  How long has it been there?  I guess had he been on time it would have sat for at least ten more minutes.
We ordered pan fried potstickers...they were more like deep fried...very greasy and not good.  We also ordered General Tso chicken extra spicy.   This barely tasted hot and it was listed on the ticket as extra spicy.  Did they run out of peppers?  The most disturbing dish was the chicken Lo Mein.  The chicken was just as low grade you could find.  The noodles were limp and sooooo greasy.  Ended up throwing that away.
Next time will pay a few dollars more and go to PF Changs."}
{"text":"Small take out place with a few tables. The food is good (orange chicken has real oranges) and it is a LOT per order! Their beef is a little fatty but otherwise good. Chow mein is very good. Food is fresh and well worth the money."}
{"text":"My disabled husband loves the food here.   Especially the chow fun noodles.  they are quick, food is cooked fresh, just over all great."}
{"text":"Food is good. Definitely conveniently located for me. I ordered takeout and the food arrived literally piping hot. I ordered the Egg Drop Soup. It was seriously so hot. I had to let it cool before I could eat it. That's impressive for takeout. It's your typical egg drop soup. I also ordered chicken fried rice and Kung Pao chicken. All the food was good.... Nothing amazing, but definitely good Chinese food. Portion size is also pretty good. You definitely get your money's worth."}
{"text":"As a true New Yorker it is hard to find good take out Chinese here in Vegas.  Chopstix comes the closest to home.  Very friendly service!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food here. Me and my friend were some of the only people there and the food was made fresh and came out quick. 

I really enjoyed eating here and tasting the flavor of the food. I will definitely be back to see what other delicious items I can come across. Just wish the dinning area was more inviting."}
{"text":"When we lived in Atlanta our neighborhood was about 50% Asian and there was an abundance of very authentic Chinese restaurants...sometimes too authentic. Ingredients like cow lung, tripe, jellied pigs blood and chicken feet (yes...fried chicken feet) were common place. Basically the only thing they didn't eat was the snout and the asshole, and I'm not even sure about the later. 
    So upon moving here we decided we wanted some good, old fashioned Americanized Chinese food and boy did we find it with Chopstix! The General Tso's chicken and Happy family sure made this family happy. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra few bucks for the extra meat and noodles instead of rice. Everything was delicious and both times we have stuffed ourselves silly (and had plenty for the beloved leftovers the next day). 
    Unlike the authentic Chinese restaurants back home who (oddly) didn't deliver, Chopstix had our food to us hot, fresh and in about 25 minutes. I might note that we found the delivery fee to be pretty steep at 3.50$, but maybe that is the norm here. Either way, it was worth it to us and it won't deter us from ordering (although maybe from ordering as frequently). 
    All in all, a great place. We look forward to ordering again soon."}
{"text":"Food is great, delivery guy is completely another story! He made it a point to rudely  demand a tip when I forgot to add it to the card. Practically came into my home when I told him I had cash upstairs. I wish I knew his name, I'd ask to never had him deliver my food again."}
{"text":"Cream cheese & crab wontons - pretty good 
Pork fried rice - full of goodies
Sweet & sour pork - crispy but not over cooked

Chopstix is a great little place for your Chinese food fix. The prices are great for a family. I usually spend about $50 and I'm able to feed a family of six. There are no leftovers but everyone is satisfied. 

Not a restaurant I would ever eat in because of the lack of atmosphere. They do have a plant in the front window but other than that, pretty plain.

Overall, I really enjoy this place."}
{"text":"Delivery time was acceptable 30mins. Food was ok. I ordered the shrimp fried rice. Wasn't the worst but wasn't the best either. There are better places out there."}
{"text":"I read the reviews and decided to give it a try. My first experience with this restaurant was good.  I liked their pork fried rice and I like their Singapore noodles.  That's about all they do well.  Everything else I've tried is not so good.  I don't like deep fried chicken that is soaked in sauce until it's soggy... blech!  I don't like it when a menu reads \"spring rolls\" and you end up with egg rolls... they are two different things.  And though I like the pork fried rice, the fried rice you end up with as an accompaniment with your meal is not edible.  Really wish I could find a Chinese place close to home that's worth the trip."}
{"text":"Quick delivery and great quality food. Highly recommended the Orange Chicken and Kung Pow Chicken"}
{"text":"Ordered tonight close to closing. The food was excellent fresh hot and delicious. I ordered on the eat 24 app about 20 minutes before closing. The delivery guy was very rude and told me \"you know the place closes at 10\" I apologized and said I didn't realize the hours of business. He grabbed the money out of my hand said whatever and drove off. This was after I gave him a $8 tip on a $30 order not to bad I don't think. I will order from here again for sure but next time I will be picking up!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The only reason I don't eat here every day is because I don't want them to get tired of seeing me. I have NEVER had a bad experience here, and believe me when I say I go here a lot. If I had to criticize one thing, it's that the wait can be a bit long. But that's the price you have to pay when you want fresh food. It's more than worth the wait. Hands down this is my go to spot."}
{"text":"I've been her to pick up orders for others, but never thought about eating here. I really just wanted some fried rice.  But decided to get the orange chicken w/ fried rice.  I  don't see myself ever going to that other chain establishment anymore.  This orange chicken had oranges in it.....This had such a different flavor than what I'm accustomed too!  And it's very affordable. The people here are always nice.  I'm going to have to try something different next time."}
{"text":"American Chinese food is greasy and terrible everywhere, and that's what we know and love about it. However, Chopstix has accomplished the amazing feat of actually making greasy, fried food taste bland.

One day, I came home craving Chinese and serendipitously found one of their menus stuffed in my mailbox, along with some absurdly good coupons. I placed a huge order and paid almost nothing for it. I guess I got what I paid for, because the food was barely edible. The Cold Sesame Noodles were just plain noodles--no sauce, and I don't think the Fried Rice was actually fried, but it was inexplicably neon yellow in color. I couldn't even find the chicken in my General Tso's--it was mostly breading and a sweet and sour sauce.

I learned my lesson. Trust me, don't get sucked in by their prices--just say NO to Chopstix!"}
{"text":"Food and service was great, ordered shrimp Lo mein and beef fried rice, didn't care too much for the white onions in the fried rice, but it was still pretty good."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch in between meetings. Fast food counter, friendly staff and a wide variety of Chinese food on the menu. They have 7 tables and can seat 20 people total. It's a small place, clearly catering to takeout and delivery more than dining in. The dodgy Chinese dude in the corner was also an interesting - looked like an old gangster watching his business all day. 

I ordered two basic choices to gage quality of their kitchen: House Lo Meln and Beef Fried Rice. Simple choices, I know, but I'm not about to order Oyster Sauce shrimp or anything deep fried based on the appearance of the place first time. 

As it turns out the Lo Mein was magnificent. Beef, Chicken, Pork and Shrimp in the House Lo Mein dish, the flavors and quality were good for a takeout choice. I was impressed. The Beef fried rice was also good, a little dry for me but well made and packed with everything you want from a fried rice. Quality was also good on this which is always a concern when ordering fried rice.

Overall I was very pleased with the food at Chopstix. It's quick, perfect for takeout, and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is always fresh and made to order. We come here at least 3 times a month. People are friendly"}
{"text":"Their shrimp lo-mein is the only \"alright\" dish. I tried the shrimp with broccoli once and it was garbage. A guy told me this was the best place ever. We aren't friends anymore.

2 stars because both Lai Lai Wok and Cravings are better than this place in my opinion. And they are right the corner from chopstix."}
{"text":"I've dined in and ordered out from here, it has delicious food and sweet staff. Delivery is usually earlier than expected. We always order the same food cuz its freaking good, chicken Lo mein for my daughter, Pork Lo mein for the hubby, and orange chicken for moi! I'm gonna missed this place when we move, its always hard to find a good Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm into it, especially considering that there are almost no options for Chinese around here (other than China A Go Go, which is also pretty good).

The family dinners are a great deal and they feed us for two days.

While its not going to blow your mind, for the price and convenience I would recommend it to anyone living nearby."}
{"text":"ordered delivery again tonite ..  again it arrived super fast, super fresh and piping HOT!!!
.panda who!!?!? XD"}
{"text":"Just moved to Henderson and have been looking for a great Chinese delivery. Last night we got Chopstix and let me just tell you! We will be new customers for sure! Food came hot, fresh and in great plastic containers not your typical boxes. Tons of goon for great prices! We had orange chicken(a little spicy which I never had before) DELICIOUS, next was the walnut shrimp which was spectacular, huge shrimps great sauce and also large portion! The pork lo mein was awesome also. We can't wait to try more from this place!"}
{"text":"This place has never let me down, they have great quick service that does not affect the quality of the food. The food remains me of those old Chinese restaurants my parents used to take us too when I was a kid living in Los Angeles. Anyway this place is centrally located in a shopping center across from the super Walmart."}
{"text":"For the money,  it's a good deal...plenty of food. Online and Yep delivery is a bonus. ..Taste. ..Meh."}
{"text":"I opened a Yelp account specifically to do this review. I read the other reviews and they sounded great!. I ordered the Pad Thai and BBQ ribs to go. The food arrived fairly quickly. When I opened the container, the Pad Thai looked like glued together super thick noodles. I had to use a knife to cut into it! It was by far the worst tasting Pad Thai I've ever had including the ones I tried to make at home using spaghetti noodles. It didn't even smell right! The BBQ ribs although there's quite a lot in one order was very, very dry and it looked like I got a days worth of their end pieces. Even the Fortune Cookies I got were super dry! The best part of the meal was the Iced Tea that I bought at the gas station across the street. Maybe they just didn't like me. I was even nice enough to let the lady on the register finish her game on her phone before placing my order. I guess I'm going hungry tonight.... Lucky me I bought TWO cans of Iced Tea, so I have that going for me tonight...."}
{"text":"Came in on a whim and was pleasantly surprised. Very small hole in the wall type place but surprisingly good. 

Service was quick and efficient - most people,I assume,choose to take out - but I was attended to very quickly. 

Food is freshly cooked - steaming hot! Ordered a lunch special,an appetizer and a pint of soup for under $18 and the portions are BIG. took an estimate of 5-10 minutes to get everything set on my table. Very fast. 

Love that it's close to my apartment and open late! (Closes 10:30pm). Definitely worth a try if you live in the south west area"}
{"text":"Chopstix is a New York style Chinese restaurant.  They usually have your last order on file in their computers.  For a take out Chinese place, it's pretty good.  The house fried rice is one of my favorites there.  Their mongolian beef, beef broccoli, and other meat entrees are also prepared well.  They have a seafood special which isn't something I particularly liked.  The sauce is a bit slimy, and the scallops and imitation crab meat doesn't compliment the vegetables that well.  However, if you want quick take out, this isn't a bad place to go."}
{"text":"I feel really bad because they are really nice, but the food was not edible. I ordered a ton... wontons (both pork and cream cheese) were chewy and gross, shrimp noodles I couldn't even pick out the shrimp to save, the orange chicken was the most edible.  Nice place! Nice people, but the food needs work"}
{"text":"this place is awesome.  great prices always friendly....its a chain but it has that family owned kinda feeling to it.  fish quality is great for the price.  best bang for your buck for sure, and this is coming from a san franciscan"}
{"text":"It was a Tuesday night. The weather was just breezy enough to wear a light jacket, but the skies had formed a deep red as the sun had just set beneath the mountains surrounding the valley. My boyfriend had just received the keys to his new house and I was excited to see what it had looked like. The rooms were void of furniture and as we sat together on the carpet in the empty living room, we talked about the endless possibilities of ways to decorate. Suddenly, I hear a growl in my stomach. \"Feeeeeed meeeeee,\" it screams. My boyfriend, understanding it was getting late and there was no food in this new house, quickly grabs his keys and we both run to the car. The car speeds down Marks Street and into the shopping center. \"Let's get Chinese food to go since you have your own kitchen now!\" I tell him. We enter Chopstix and the delicious smell of Chinese food overwhelms me. I order cream cheese wontons, sweet and sour chicken, broccoli and beef, and to my surprise, it comes with delicious chicken fried rice! I make sure to ask for extra sweet and sour sauce and we usually end up fist fighting over it if there's not enough. The lady says there is a \"big bowl\" and i see it red at the top, assuming it's full. Pleased, we head home anxious to begin eating. \"Ah, I'm so hungry, I can't wait to eat!\" he muttered. As I opened the sweet and sour sauce, we both simultaneously took a deep, sorrow breath in, realizing that there is not nearly as much sauce as we hoped for. Then, we both cried as I felt all our hopes and dreams die along with this nearly-empty bowl. There simply was not enough sweet and sour sauce. Betrayal is never a good feeling, but this hit us hard and we shared this traumatic experience together. It bonded us. The end. (The food was great though)."}
{"text":"If you're looking for good Chinese food, there are probably some better options on campus... (Cravings, Lai Lai Wok). However, I am admittedly a frequent flyer of this restaurant due to the late hours (open until 3AM) and the fact that they deliver. My go to order here is shrimp lo mien and crab rangoon."}
{"text":"Solid Chinese food. This place is definitely better than a Panda Express- solid food, cheap delivery, friendly service. The orange chicken used actual oranges. 

It's not amazing and it did take just over an hour but its solid and reliable enough that I'd definitely order from again."}
{"text":"The food is ehhh and the \"chicken\" tastes horrible. Always bad but I'm insane because I continue to order from them simply for the convenience but the quality of the food is poor and prices way too high!!! Not worth it. I'm going on a diet and will not order from them anymore! The drivers are always super nice though."}
{"text":"I'm no longer entertained.

The delivery/service is good buT the food has gone downhill.  

No chicken inside the general tso pieces.  Just inflated-breaded-crap lol.  You're like...where's the chicken people!?? $$$Pricey too."}
{"text":"Chopstix is one of my favorite Chinese food. I've had order so many times for delivery. They were so fast to get my apt. And this is best place that When I study too late. I ordered Eggplant And rice noodle today. It was really so good. Anyway I will keep ordering Chopstix!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place, they are nice about substitutions and they are consistently good! And their delivery fees are very reasonable. I've never had a bad experience and they have good portions and prices."}
{"text":"Worst food no flavor and high prices . Bought a Thai tea it came in a can wtf . Never go here ."}
{"text":"If you gave me the option to give NEGATIVE stars, I would. The delivery guy did not know how to operate the call-box at our secure door & called me twice from his cell to help him. He wanted to know if I could just come down to the door & get the food.  From the small amount I was able to eat, I have food poisoning and have entered a formal complaint with SNHD.  
I called the manager on duty last night, a female, and told her the food didn't taste right and she told me that everyone else liked it! I explained that the shrimp was rubbery and the beef was spongy & chewy and that both tasted \"off\". The Wonton soup broth was very dark & tasted old--I didn't even try the dumpling. She continued to ask me why I did not think the food was good because other people liked it. I told her that I did not like it & could not eat the food. She asked if I had ever eaten at Chopstix before & where was it. She asked me if I were sure that I did not eat all the food & just did not want to pay, to which I replied that I would bring all of it back on 2/02/16 and she wanted me to bring it back right away but finally agreed on 2/02/16, but said she would have to check it before giving me a refund!!!!  I want ALL  my money back and will NEVER eat here again. Worst food and rude service ever!"}
{"text":"Very good.  No surprises in the recipes like so many Vegas chinese restaurants that I've tried.  The sesame chicken, kung poa chicken and even the chicken lo mein were all delicious.  I loved that you could get rice or lo mein as side dishes to your entrée without having to order them at  full price by themselves.  A box of rice was included and lo mein had a $2 charge.  The bottom line was very fair. The portions were good and we had leftovers the next day.

The $3.50 charge for delivery was a charge I don't usually see on Chinese take-out. With tip, it ads a lot to a $25 check. Understandable I guess with the price of gas. We live close, so maybe we'll just start picking it up.

They have a decent website for ordering, but they should add roll-over pictures so you can see what the dishes look like. I saw in the reviews that this is \"New York style.\" I'm not sure what that is, but some dishes are prepared differently than what I'm used to from California; not bad, just different. I know one example is that what I'm used to ordering as chow mein is lo mein here. I've run into that alot in Las Vegas. Photos would help alot and also encourage us to try new menu items.

In light of what we've read, I think we'll keep looking for a good sit-down place, but for take-out Chopstix has hit a home run with us."}
{"text":"Packed a delicious, nutricious lunch for the day at the office...left it at home on the kitchen counter.  Grrrrrr.

Zoomed over to chopstix for a speedy lunch special.  It was just that.  

$6 and it included your choice of a drink or an egg roll.  

Portion was certainly satisfying, place was speedy and friendly, and the price was right!

Lots of lunch special choices.  Good stop for food cheap food on the go."}
{"text":"Awesome general tso and fantastic fried rice, order it dark if you like the house sauce type flavor in it"}
{"text":"Chopstix is a pretty solid place for Chinese takeout. 

The good: 
General Tso's Chicken
Egg Drop Soup
Egg Foo Young
The location
Big portions

The not so good:
Fried Rice (it's always dry)
Mongolian Beef (something about it just isn't right to me, but my husband likes it)

Atmosphere is about zero - I never eat in, always get it to go.

Prices - eh, not sure what to say. It usually costs us about $50 for our dinner, which seems high, but then again, there is usually enough food to give us leftovers for 2 days."}
{"text":"Visiting from Philadelphia . Food tastes awful. Chicken was very dry. And I got very sick within a few hours of eating. I would stay away from this place."}
{"text":"A little bit if NY Chinese food here in Vegas. This is one of the few Chinese p that actually has NY Style Chow Mein.  We travel from the SW of the valley to get their delicious food  Check out their Beef Chow Fun & other great dishes.  They offer a wide variety of dishes & will also make something special for you. They have great prices & offer lunch specials ."}
{"text":"We were impressed!! Absolutely delicious chinese food, tons of flavor, great teriyaki!! We ordered Edamame with our delivery (EAT24.com), but they didn't have it. They called back within minutes and fixed everything and had it at our door within a half hour. New favorite place for chinese!!"}
{"text":"This is no joke the best Chinese food I have ever had. I could live off of it. The chicken fried rice is amazing.. Spicy orange chicken even more amazing.. And the list goes on. Delivery is always fast, quality is always high. I will order over and over."}
{"text":"I love this place! I order food here all the time and they never disappoint. They are very friendly on the phone, sometimes hard to understand but they always get my order correct. The price of the food is very reasonable too ranging from $6.95 to 10.95 for main entrees. My family loves their egg rolls , BBQ park ribs with bone in, and I love their beef teriyaki sticks for appetizers. As far as entrees, I always get the Honey walnut shrimp . It is so delicious and they give you a big order. The shrimps are the large prawns with a perfect amount of sweet mayo and honey. My daughter loves their sweet & sour pork and Mongolian beef! They are pretty fast to deliver your food , we rarely have to wait unless it's super busy and even then it's probably just an additional 5 minutes if they are busy. What I also like is they have your address saved to your phone number, which makes ordering easy and fast. They are also good at calling if they have any issues or are running behind. Last but not least . I love that when you order a $40 amount of food. They give you coupons for 1 free entrees! I love that because we always order lots of food, so it's nice to get something for free. This is Americanized Chinese food but it's very worth it. I've been a customer for 6 years now and will continue to be a loyal customer!"}
{"text":"Will not be ordering from this place again... I ordered two combination plates one with ribs and the other with garlic shrimp both came with fried rice.. They gave me 4 ribs but might as well say only two, two of the ribs they classified as ribs were small bones with literally no meat and the garlic shrimp only came with 3 shrimp. My total came up to $20 and I was very dissatisfied with the food... I have ordered from them multiple times for delivery but I will not be ordering anymore.. Make sure if you order ribs from them you let them know that you want the full 4 ribs you're paying for because this is the second time they have done that but I thought it was just a mistake the first time but turn out they are just some greedy Chinese that takes your money and try to feed you scraps."}
{"text":"Came looking for soup on this cold day! Searched yelp and found this place. The wife ordered won ton soup and it hit the spot. Soup has great flavor and was served really hot. The won ton was okay. We have had better. The mister ordered roast pork Lo Mein which is very tasteful. We will definitely come back to try other dishes. Yummy!!"}
{"text":"I miss you, Chopstix.  Since I moved across the country in July, I think about your General Tso's tofu on a weekly basis, at least.  Maybe one day, I will return and smuggle some onto the plane back.  Much love."}
{"text":"If I had done this review a year ago, my rating would be much higher. Chopstix used to be my goto Chinese delivery spot on campus. However, for the past few months, my orders from Chopstix have been subpar. They've all been lukewarm and the meat unable to be chewed. Today I ordered Sesame Chicken, and I was only able to eat about half of it. The rest of the chicken was really tough, and contained cuts of meat that just aren't fit for consumption. Delivery times aren't so great either. It took a good 40-45 minutes for this past order around 9pm during winter break, so they can't be too busy. I don't think I'll be ordering from Chopstix again."}
{"text":"This place is alright.  Not the greatest Chinese food I've had in this valley but solid for sure.  I ordered house special chicken lunch.  The chicken was good and just a little bit crispy which was nice.  I wish there was more of it.  But there was a lot of mushrooms and other vegetables that bulked up the dish.  The sauce was amazing, whatever it was.  The fried rice was under fried for me but the flavor was nice.  The lo mein was over cooked and mushy.  That was a let down.  The egg roll was crispy on the outside but kind of soggy on the inside and lacked much substance.  I would have preferred perhaps a cup of egg drop soup in place of the egg roll.

The service here was great.  The lady behind the counter kept checking on me and picking up trash I was leaving in my wake.  This is an OK place to come for a quick Chinese meal but I think I want to look around a little more."}
{"text":"Today it was 91 degrees when I picked up my order and it was even hotter inside the place.  I had ordered 4 lunch specials.  General Tso Chicken was extremely bland and I asked \"where's the chicken\".  It was 90% breading and  on one piece I ate there was no chicken.  Garlic Chicken was OK, but again, very bland for a dish that is to be spicy.  The shrimp and lobster sauce was tasteless.  The broccoli beef was actually the best dish.  Tender beef, flavorful sauce, fresh broccoli.  The spring rolls lacked filling.  Overall, I don't think I would order from them again.  I will say my order was ready when I got there and packaged perfectly."}
{"text":"Chopstix is the best delivery chinese in town; the food is great.  The menu is globally pretty good, but I always end up ordering the mongolian beef, house fried rice and pan fried dumplings.  I called to order lunch once and they were busy, so they offered to call me back rather than keep me on hold.  Great touch."}
{"text":"I found this Chinese Restaurant on Yelp. It's good food, affordable prices and great sesame Chicken. Prices are fair and they offer large portions...definitely lots of leftovers. I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"It was really good but the mangolian beef could have had more meat than vegetables. We are visiting from Georgia and we have one their so it is not new to me."}
{"text":"My favorite place for Chinese take out. My boyfriend and I are regular customers. Everyone is very nice and always has our food ready in a matter of no time. Defiantly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Full disclosure ahead of time: I worked here as a cashier for a few months (October 2012 to February 2013). As one of the only establishments open after 2 AM on campus, it caters to the last call crowd; having been on both sides of the table, literally, this in itself is quite the experience.

As for the food, I would go to Cravings for more complicated dishes, but for staples like spicy chicken fried rice, orange/sesame/General Tso's chicken, Chopstix can't be beat."}
{"text":"If you have a food allergy DO NOT ORDER from this place. I asked for no mushrooms and they out mushrooms in the food. I ask for mild and I get spicy. Will not visit or order from them again."}
{"text":"I'm scared to order from here anymore. The food is bad and the last driver couldn't find my condo. Made me run outside and find him. Pretty pathetic"}
{"text":"Everything was perfect here!
Fresh veggies, temp of my food, and the portion size
Tried Kung pao chicken and mongolian beef!! Yum yum yum"}
{"text":"I been coming here for Chinese food for 3 years now since I moved to Las Vegas from California and realized today that I have not yet posted my review because every time i order here the food is Amazing  I absolutely love the shrimp chowmein noodles and my other 2 entrees I order are the house chicken and Mongolian beef both entrees come with two steam rice boxes also the deep fried cream cheese wontons are areally good as well and I get this delivered to my home in less than 30 minutes !!! They are the best!!! And the food is bomb.com"}
{"text":"My crab wontons smelled like plastic.my food was cooked in old grease.I order the shrimp in lobster sauce my rice was not separate but mixed in .I'm a long time customer and I would not recommend this place to a dog.I will not be coming back.my food was soggy."}
{"text":"This restaurant is really small, probably because they're known for take-outs. 

We ordered lemon chicken, sweet and sour chicken, and hot and sour soup. It comes with white rice and one meal is good for two. Food is OK. No \"WOW\" factor but it's not bad. Plus the price is really cheap, so its worth it ;)"}
{"text":"OMG how vile...where to begin! Bit into an egg roll only to have some sort of a gelatinous ooze and drip grease on my pajamas.  If you can't have sugar RUN! Ordered shrimp and cashew chicken only to open plastic containers of meats and mystery pieces covered in a brown sugary substance.  No recognizable vegetables to be found.  I also ordered soup...do I dare taste it?  I am a VERY angry blue collar worker who wanted a relaxing evening and a treat of having dinner delivered.  If you don't hear from me this weekend, check the local hospitals just in case I'm admitted for food poisoning."}
{"text":"Best Chinese I've had ... I got the lunch special and it's more than enough food for 1... 2 if you both aren't super hungry! It may be a little hole in the wall but I'd rather go here than PF Changs any day ... It could be a little bit bigger with more seating and there was no trash can but they clean the tables when you leave so that's no biggie ... Overall I look forward to going here again ! It's next to the GameStop if you plan on going"}
{"text":"I lived in the New York City area for about 35 years (which arguably has some of the best Chinese food in the country). I also spent a month in China, so I know what good Chinese food is.....that being said, Chopstix is pretty good. So is the food New York or China good?....Well, no..... But, for Henderson, Chopstix is very good....and so far, it is the best Henderson Chinese resturuant I have found (and I have been to many Chinese resturuants in Henderson). Chopstix is very reasonably priced, portions are big, and they do a pretty good job with some of the most popular dishes people usually order in this country (Mongolian beef, foo young, Wanton soup, etc...). If your from the New York, or San Francisco (where you are accustom to great Chinese food), I think you will still like Chopstix."}
{"text":"Ordered from here yesterday and woke up sick! I mean full on! I ordered the kung pao,moo goo gai pan, and shrimp egg foo young.. None of it was rememberable. Except for the terrible service. The guy at the counter was rude and on his cell as i was speaking to him.. Just not what i expected. Hate that i got what i would explain as food poison no worth my 30 bucks. Wish i could get a refund:("}
{"text":"We ordered take out and it was delicious! It's on my list of locations to order from when I don't want to eat on the strip! We ordered an Orange Chicken combination plate and Pepper Steak w Onion combination plate. They were great!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of Chopstix delivery service! Chopstix is a new Chinese restaurant on Green and 2nd.  My roommate has been ordering food there a couple of times and encouraged me to try it. The menu is like any other chinese restaurant: soup, appetizer, poultry, fried rice, etc. 

The girl who picked up the phone was very nice. I ordered the General Tso's Chicken entree which included a side of whtie rice and was priced $9.05. A lot of the entrees are p riced between $8-9 which isn't too bad. It's on the border of pricey, however, I don't mind paying this much from Chopstix. They have a combo platter which I wouldn't recommend ordering. The combo platter is priced between $7-$7.50 and is a smaller portion than the entree. It is served with steamed white rice or fried rice with a choice of either egg roll or spring roll. The portion is too small and they don't give you enough meat in the combo platter. In addition, the egg roll isn't that great. However, my General Tso Chicken entree came in a timely manner. It was hot and fresh. The delivery guy was very polite and I gave him a $2 tip. On the side note, I just found out that they will charge a $1.50 delivery fee if your order is $15.00... oh well. I'm excited that they're open till 3AM which I need to take advantage of in the future. 

Anyways, I would recommend ordering at Chopstix again. Thank you, roomie for this awesome recommendation."}
{"text":"I was seeking a decent Chinese take out/delivery restaurant in town, so I saw that Chopstix was highly rated on Yelp.  However, what is not reflected in the high ratings is what the normal clientele are for the restaurant.  I am sure that Chopstix is great for college students who are seeking something late night to soak up all of the booze on a Friday night.  All I am looking for is decent Chinese take out.  And I found this food barely edible.  The General Tso's chicken was so dry as to be difficult to chew.  The good news is that the portions are very large.  So you get very large quantities of nearly inedible food.

I definitely will not be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been enjoying this place for a year and a half now. They are always very quick and reasonably priced. Really delicious food and friendly. Try the cashew chicken!"}
{"text":"Coming from the northeast I've definitely lowered my standard for Chinese food, so I'll admit this isn't the best food around.  What I will say is that their service is amazing and since they are the only late night Chinese restaurant around (especially with delivery) when it's necessary they are tops!

I've come to realize, it's acutally pretty decent food.  You can't go wrong with General Tso's or Orange Chicken.  My friend likes their fried dumplings and their Wonton Soup is good.  

What you'll notice is every time you come in, regardless of it's your first or second time, they'll always greet you with a smile and take care of you.  There's a sweet girl who works in there, who I swear must be on pills because she is always happy and super nice to you.  It's mainly a take-out and delivery place, but you can eat there.  When you eat there, they'll serve you water and bring you napkins and such, but it's not really an eat-in place.  There's a 3% discount if you pay cash.

Being on a college campus, we all get interesting cravings for interesting things throughout the night.  Chopstix is currently the only restaurant I know of that does both take-out and delivery until at least 3:00am.  By the way, delivery is relatively quick.  

Just try it out, it's pretty good."}
{"text":"Frickin Horrible!!! I usually go to the one on Silverado Ranch & everything is great. This place blows!!! I ordered the Mongolian Beef w/extra meat and they charged me $3 , the other location only charges $2 & I asked for extra spicy.... Well, no extra spicy & it woluld seem they took this as an opportunity to  use whatever they had lying around and try to pass it off as beef. I got a bowl full of bland rubbery/chewy nastiness. Never going back again, I recommend you never go at all!!"}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!! I came in and ordered takeout, while making one of the dishes The to go container fell in the floor and the man cooking picked it up and put it back on the counter to fill!!! I had to run up to the counter and tell the lady to stop him. 

Then, that got me curious what was going on back there so I started looking in the kitchen from the checkout counter. As soon as I started looking and they noticed, they closed all the lids over the food so I couldn't see or take pics. Needless to say I canceled my $50 order and went somewhere else."}

{"text":"I ordered the pork LO mein lunch and it was good. I wish they would add soup to the lunch orders. I'm so used to having soup in my lunch orders when I order Chinese. The lunch comes with fried rice and an egg roll. I didn't like how they had the fried rice under the LO mein. They combined it and I rather have them separate it in the box. Overall it was decent."}
{"text":"I've ordered from them many times and it's always been great.

Delivery is super fast.

Probably the best value for the money from any place I order from."}
{"text":"It took 40 minutes for the food to get here, and when it did, they forgot my spring roll. Because of my hunger, I was willing to let that pass. Sadly, the food wasn't much better. In layman terms, the food was crappy. The fried rice tasted like rice mixed with some salt and a lot of pepper. The beef and broccoli tasted like fake beef and nasty broccoli covered in soy sauce. I am very disappointed. Never again. I'm sure there are many better alternatives to late night Chinese food."}
{"text":"Fast
Cheap
consistently good


Ive been going here for years and it has always been good. not one bad experience"}

{"text":"Great food quick and easy and at a very reasonable price. I've order from here all the time"}
{"text":"Ordering Chopstix is like paying a drunken visit to your sleazy ex late at night. You know it's not good for you, it won't be amazing, but it'll do the job. The morning after however, you'll wake up in a flurry of greasy shame and regret.

The food was decently good the couple of times I've had Chopstix and their service is always quick and friendly. It's decently priced and portions are very generous. However, I always feel soo gross and heavy after I've had it so I'd best stay away - until the next time I'm starving at 2 am with no other options..."}
{"text":"Honestly. So many restaurants give out absolute SHIT food. It's like they don't care if every dish isn't up to par. And I don't like people that complain about everything just to complain.. But restaurants need to know when their food and service is shit. This place is better than nice Chinese restaurants I pay much more for. And I even order their shrimp which is a testament to their ability as an amazing Chinese food restaurant. Trusting Chinese food to quality seafood is like trusting Mexican restaurants to quality seafood. It's an iffy experiment but this time it pays off tremendously."}
{"text":"I went to this place twice-- I could taste MSG in their food. I will never go back.
Sorry but that is the truth."}
{"text":"Delivery option has kept me from starving a few times. Their food is always delicious and they usually deliver earlier than the estimated time. I can highly recommend the House Pad Thai and Chicken Sticks. They are both EXCELLENT!"}
{"text":"If I had to use a phrase to describe Chopstix the term I would use is \"Cost Leader\".

Price: this place is economic.

Environment: Great for a grab and go, but true to it's nature don't expect too many 'luxuries'. The utensils are on an, 'as need' basis and food is served in a take-out box. (this place is designed for take-out) 

Food: The food is definitely American-Chinese style so if you're hoping for the rare authentic gem in the wall you will be disappointed. Overall the veggies are fresh but expect the most economic, cost leader materials in use. 

I give this place 4 stars for overall value. If you're on a tight budget you get fresh veggies, meat and carbs in 1 place that is healthier than a burger."}
{"text":"Wonderful food an fast delivery. Food was piping hot an tasted very fresh. I've tried other places around here n this is now my go to place now. They give a ton of food can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Eat here all the time, very nice ppl in there! Love the chicken wings & shrimp egg fo young!"}
{"text":"The food here is decent. It's not bad at all but it's also not amazing. It's a good go-to place if you want something quick and cheap. For the prices they offer, the portions are pretty big."}
{"text":"My go to when I want late night Chinese. I usually get the lo mein or sesame chicken (or tofu) platter. For about $8-9 you get a decent portion of entree, fried or steamed rice, and a spring or egg roll. Their crab rangoons are folded more like a pocket, but are still good (little oniony, though). Delivery is fast and service is very good. Not the BEST Chinese food in town, but still good, especially when everything else is closed."}
{"text":"I believe this is the closest we have come to finding egg foo yung that is comparable to what we are used to in Chicago. They are a little different, but at least its not that gigantic pancake thing that has been cut into 4 triangles. The fried rice was good as well. The food was here quickly, it was hot and delivery was only 2.50. It took several bad experiences with China a Go Go before we went somewhere else. Glad we did. Cheaper, better food."}
{"text":"love this place! food is always fresh and tasty! me and my husband always get combo plates with chow main and peppered steak , and mangolian  beef with fried rice!  amazing! our new fav place to go !"}
{"text":"I have ordered from here twice and both times the food came quickly to my job location and was great tasting...  Being fairly new to the area it's great having this place close to work"}
{"text":"I don't get Chinese food often but when I do I know exactly what I want and what it should taste like. I ordered shrimp chow mien, crab rangoons and a spring roll. How did my chow mien turn into a soggy, slimy lomein? I bit into my spring roll that was crunchy on the outside but mushy on the inside! And the rangoons? Well let's just say they forgot the main ingredient in the name. I won't be ordering from this restaurant again. Save your money!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery. Took forever paid 34.00 for all terrible food !!! Never going there again"}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is awful. I placed an order online and waited three hours without my order being delivered. I call after and hour and a half and was told my order was on its way to me. I wait another hour and nothing so i called again and was told that they tried several times to contact me, my phone never rang. They also told me they tried to call me right after I place my order to let me know they could not deliver it, why didn't they tell me when I called? I will never order from here again. So very disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. I'm in town from Chicago and needed a place close to my hotel. UberEats recommended this place. What a waste! I spent $20 on horrible tasting fried rice. I couldn't even call it fried rice. The shrimp and garlic dish was bleh. My mistake for ordering here. I'll never order here again and recommend others to stay away. I'm now dealing with a stomach ache. Thanks Chopsh-t"}
{"text":"I get lunch here every so often. I absolutely love their General Tso's Chicken lunch special. At exactly $6 with tax, it's a perfect lunch option whenever I don't know what else I want. And it comes with a drink.

There's just something about this place that ever-so-slightly sets it apart from other run-of-the-mill Chinese restaurants (that's a lot of hyphens). They claim to serve \"New York style\" Chinese food. I'm really not sure what that means, but it's working for them. I also appreciate how they serve their to-go food. Instead of the typical styrofoam container, they use aluminum bowls with a plastic cover. I'm not sure if I'm getting more or less food, but it seems like the right amount of food (bordering on the heavy side)."}
{"text":"This place was delicious. The food was delivered hot and fresh. This was the best Chinese food I have had in a very long time."}
{"text":"The good news is that due to the lengthy wait our order was cooked fresh. Also the place is clean. Our order included the lunch house special beef, sweet and sour chicken w/lo mein, and vegetable spring rolls. Overall the food was mediocre and the rolls were soggy. If you decide to eat here don't have too high of expectations as the food does not match the price."}
{"text":"3.5 STARS- All around good Chinese restaurant 

    I enjoy trying different places, and as part of my Chinese restaurant tour Chopstix was a stop. It was Christmas Eve a special day when several restaurants were closed. Chopstix was open. I'd pull into the Walmart Neighborhood Market-anchored shopping center at the northeast corner of Bermuda and Silverado Ranch Roads. After the Christmas Eve lunch, I'd enjoy the experience to the degree of returning in the beginning of the new year. 

   In reality I have been familiar with Chopstix. This location is actually Chopstix 2. In the past, I have dined at their Eastern at Windmill location a couple of times. A few years ago, I gave it a good rating ( https://www.yelp.com/biz/chopstix-las-vegas ). What both locations share in common is a take-out style environment, good food, decent service, and good lunch specials. 

   On my two visits here, I spent less than $10 on a lunch special with a fountain beverage. With the exception of an employee bringing the paper plate of food to one of the few tables, this is mainly a self-serve restaurant. 

   Following the headline of the review: 3.5 Stars: All around Good Chinese food; the food isn't bad nor outstanding. It is good Chinese food that I enjoyed the Christmas Day visit when I ordered the shrimp lo mein lunch special then early in January 2016 when I ordered the pepper steak lunch special. Both times, the lunch special included the soup of the that is the expected egg drop soup. The lunch specials featured the entree on the right half of the plate with the fried rice on the left and an egg roll at the 12 o' clock position. I appreciate that the entree takes up at least half the plate in contrast to a few places where filler soft chow mein noodles and fried rice takes up more than half. Additionally, I appreciate that the Chopstix lunch menu includes shrimp lo mein. The facts that more than half the plate is an entree and they offer shrimp lo mein for lunch merrits a 1/2 rating increase. 

   After stopping by Chopstix 2 two times on my Chinese Restaurant tour, I spread the word that it is a good Chinese restaurant. I wouldn't travel out of my way to eat here, however, if I was nearby there is a possibility that I would return."}
{"text":"The past few days I have been taking advantage of Chinese restaurant lunch specials in my area. Yesterday, I hit up Chop Stix (in the Eastern at Windmill Smith's shopping center).
  I've been going to Chop Stix for approximately five years. I expected a three to four star experience.
  I sat down before 4 pm, when the lunch special was still available. At Chop Stix, the lunch special is served with the crunchy noodles, a can of soda, and the entree with fried rice. Deviating from the norm of a good number of Las Vegas Chinese restaurants, chow mein noodles are not included.
  Chop Stix has a few things that the Chinese restaurants that I've dined in lately don't. Lo mein is offered as a lunch special entree. That was my entree! Instead of forcing won ton soup lovers to fork over $6 for a quart of won ton soup, Chop Stix also serves a pint of it for $2.65. Minus the chow mein, a larger portion of the meal features the entree.
  The service is average. Sure, I would of enjoyed the won ton soup ahead of the entree, and not to have had to get up to ask for duck sauce, then for a straw. In life nothings perfect.
  Before the tip, a lunch special plus a pint of won ton soup costed approximately $8.50. Wow! All this freshly cooked Chinese food runs for around the exact price of Panda Express."}
{"text":"3.5 STARS

   Chopstix is a small Chinese Restaurant with a take-out atmosphere located in the Mark's Street Walmart Supercenter Shopping Center (southeast corner of Sunset Road) in the building parallel to the road. Located a considerable distance from the Walmart Supercenter, there is sufficient close by parking. 

  Driving all over the southeast valley on the search for Plantar Fasciitis boots, I was hungry by the time that I left Sear's. Recently, I observed a Chopstix in the nearby Walmart Supercenter Shopping Center. From that time forward it lived in my head as a mental bookmark. It was time to scratch off this mental bookmark. 

  I am a fan of the Chinese restaurant luncheon special. When the Chinese restaurant is high-grade, the luncheon is very reasonable. At Chopstix, they feature both a luncheon and dinner combination special. The luncheon specials start at $6.25. The dinner combinations start off at $7.25.

  There are two reasons that the Chopstix luncheon special stands out from the majority of  the Chinese restaurant luncheon specials that I have ordered. The first reason is that the Chopstix luncheons exclude the customary soup of the day which is usually egg drop or hot and sour soup. The second reason, is that in place of the noodle based chow mein, the Chopstix luncheon includes lo mein. A beverage costs extra here. For the record I don't recall Chopstix giving me a fortune cookie. It's all good though. 

  Off the luncheon menu, I ordered the shrimps with lobster sauce. The kindly woman who took my order and payment chatted over all the people that like shrimps with lobster sauce. Maybe if I had told her about all the people who love New York style chow mein they would of added it to the menu. Anyways, I'd see her one more time when she delivered the food to my table. 

  The shrimps with lobster sauce luncheon included the following : lo mein (which I stated), an egg roll that resembled a spring roll, and fried rice. With a soda, the luncheon special came out to around $8. It was $8 well-spent. The shrimp with lobster sauce was delicious. 

The delicious shrimps and flavoring of the lobster sauce served with savory lo mein is tasty food that leaves me with a favorable taste of Chopstix. It is a favorable taste worthy of 3.5 stars. Since they never gave me a fortune cookie, I'll write a fortune that says,  \"You may return to Chopstix when you are in the Mark's Street Walmart Supercenter Center parking lot before 4 'o' clock.\""}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!!!!!! I ordered online for delivery. First off, the delivery guy called me to tell me that he was at my house. Uh, just knock?? 
I ordered the sweet and sour chicken, DRY. 
My fiancé ordered the empress chicken and he said it was okay.
I don't think we will order from here again."}
{"text":"The food here is outstanding!!!! I had the honey walnut shrimp and my fiance had the Mongolian dish.  The honey walnut shrimp was cooked just right to the point where the batter was a little crunchy and shrimp was flavorful.  The Mongolian meat was very juicy and tender.  The staff was very polite and helpful.  i will be coming back to this location again"}
{"text":"Just found this place after living in the area for a couple of years.  Very tasty all-purpose Chinese food.  It appears to be family run, and everyone there is very friendly and helpful.  We ordered delivery to the house a couple weeks ago, and it was at the front door in well under a half hour from the moment we got off the phone!  

It's definitely 99% take-out and delivery.  They do have a dining area of sorts, but it's not really used or entirely set up for people to eat there.

About the only issue I've had is that their combo meals state that they come with an egg roll, and we have yet to see one in the package.  But those combos are so reasonably priced, especially for the amount of food you get, that I've never thought to go back and complain about it.  Can't blame them too much if I haven't brought it up to them..."}
{"text":"Nomnomnom. I'm not really familiar with Henderson so I didn't really know where to eat. I was really craving chinese food though. I saw this on Yelp and decided to give it a try.

I ordered the lunch special which cost me $6.25. It came with fried rice, lo mein, the orange chicken and an egg roll. It was pretty good! It wasn't too salty or too bland. The portions were pretty good. Service was quick and they were really friendly. The restaurant also looked very clean. Anyways, if you haven't tried this place, you should go on and try it. I enjoyed it very much!"}
{"text":"I go here all the time! The food is always amazing and cooked fresh when you order. I have had pretty much everything on the menu, and love it all! They beef and broccoli for some reason is out of this world! My only complaint is sometimes the lady that takes the order doesn't understand what you say, I have had a few mixups with egg rolls and asking for extra sesame sauce, but that's really not a biggie since it doesn't happen too often. 
*tip, if you order the combo plates, you get about as much food as a 2 entree panda meal with egg roll for like 3 bucks less than at panda."}
{"text":"Please do not support this establishment. They are extremely rude. I ordered a large egg fried rice (delivery), recieved in an hour when they said 40mins, & when I got my food I couldn't eat it because it was very hard. My cousin ordered combo meals & they're food was gross & hard too. I called to make a complaint & a male & female worker went off on me. I've eaten here before so I know how the rice is supposed to be. They both told my cousin & I to never eat there again. I asked to speak with a manager & asked for my money back & she hung up on me. I've called 6 times & they both hung up on me.

The lady also told me if I kept complaining she would call the cops on me. Wtf calls the cops on customers who don't like their food? They're a bunch of idiots.

**** Do not eat here!!!!****"}
{"text":"I'm seriously disappointed at the modest number of local places that will service the midnight appetites of college students.  And given the intense competition among Chinese restaurants in Champaign, I think it was a smart business tactic for Chopstix to exploit the late night market.  Chopstix delivers food until around 3:00 a.m. each night; the trade-off is that they don't open until 4:00 p.m.

The actual storefront is just a counter with 3 tables (not really an invitation to stay and eat), but the service is friendly and enthusiastic.

As for the menu, you'll find all those greasy Americanized-Chinese standards: lo mein, fried rice, and combo platters (entree, rice, and egg roll).  You'll need a gallon of water to offset the astronomical salt content of the food, but nobody eats at a place like this without expecting to do so.

I ordered shrimp egg foo young, and the quality was above average.  The egg patties were an equal mix of meat and sliced vegetables (onions and nappa), with the edges crisp from frying.  I liked that the vegetables still had some substance and texture, and that the sauce wasn't a heavy, sluggish gravy.  Some bright green onions were even sprinkled on top to offer color to a usually drab plate of food.

Overall, a welcome addition to the late night eateries in Champaign, especially as the food is really pretty decent."}
{"text":"I highly recommend chopstix. The pricing is best i've seen anywhere and the food is great but most important John prvides the best customer service and has a great personality, He makes u feel at home."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best general tso's chicken I've had in Vegas so far! Great service and amazing yummy food for not that expensive! It is great"}
{"text":"This place serves the best Chinese food and the workers r really friendly and the environment is really friendly and it's just the best place to get Chinese food"}
{"text":"I don't write reviews, but was really compelled to because of our experience with Chopstix last night.  It was our first time there and both my daughter and I found it the other day on Yelp when we were talking about how we wanted some Chinese food.

We ordered the family dinner A with egg drop soup, chicken fried rice, orange and sesame chicken (the kids like fried chicken) to go.  Experience ordering and getting our food was great,  we were off to a great start and had high hopes for the food and we were hungry.

Got home unpacked the bag and we were missing our egg rolls and crab rangoons, ok we though, we will get them next time we go back (receipt did list them, so they just missed packing them probably).  The orange and sesame chicken were decent and edible, but nothing spectacular.  The chicken fried rice tasted old or stale, my daughter and I had one serving of it and didn't want more (which is unusual for us with fried rice).  Then it tuned worse, we tried the egg drop soup... it was either rotten, or made with rotten eggs - none of us got more than a spoonful down and we were done.

Maybe we ordered the wrong thing, went on an off night, or whatever, we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Great Food, Great price, Great people all around Great... So good 3rd time this week have been hear... The people are soooo nice.. Way better than panda...."}
{"text":"This was not only incredibly delicious, but they delivered quickly and the food was hot and fresh ....so good...will definitely order again !!!!"}
{"text":"The building reeked like rotten food/garbage. It hit me as soon as I opened the door. Used to love their food but for my healths sake I will not return.  I can't believe they were actually open and doing business with that stench...then again there were no other customers in there when I went...wonder why."}
{"text":"Very bad. Orange chicken had a very sharp bone. Fried rice had so many sprouts and onions it was too crunchy to eat. Crispy noodles for soup were undercooked and couldn't be chewed. So bad. And now I'm sad ):"}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Great food, great value. People who work there are really friendly and food usually comes out very fast. I love their general tso's chicken, egg drop soup, hot and sour soup, and so many others. so stop by, it's going to be worth your money"}
{"text":"I'm from NY, land of pizza, bagels, and amazing Chinese take out joints on literally every corner... and when I'm out here on business, which is often, I sometimes get a hankerin' for some Chinese take out.  Here in Vegas, good Chinese take out is VERY hard to find.  Chopstix has come the closest to that amazingness back home that I'm used to.  Chicken and broccoli was amazing, as were the pan fried dumplings.  The shrimp lo mein was OK.  The wontons in the wonton soup were not to my liking.  Service was easy to order online and arrived pretty quick and without issue."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good. Ordered cheese wontons, egg drop soup and general tso's chicken. Had it delivered... Came piping hot! Some of the best soup I've had. Everything was pretty good. Would get again and probably get just a combo plate instead."}
{"text":"I always come to this business cause it's close to my home but the food is not spectacular. It's good but I can't seem to give it more stars than just 3. The service is good and everyone is friendly. One great special they have is the buy 3 lunch specials get the 4th free. I always seem to like the shrimp with lobster sauce, beef with broccoli and the Kung Pao beef. 

It's a great go to Chinese establishment of your not in the mood to cook that day."}
{"text":"Called in my order for take out. Process was very easy with friendly staff. When I arrived I found they have several tables for dining in as well. Food was good and price was right. Was helped as soon as I walked In the door. :)"}
{"text":"This place is great! Everything's is made fresh. The numerous lunch specials are only $5.75 served 7 days per week. Large portions, enough to feed 2. The beef with garlic sauce is the bomb! Lean pieces of tender beef with fresh veggies, choice of fried or steam rice and choice of egg roll or canned soda. A fortune cookie or 2 is included which is fun and they are fresh not stale like other places. I eat here 1-2 times per week."}
{"text":"This is mediocre chinese takeout, which is really saying something.  It's also incredibly expensive.  My total for some shrimp lo mein and crab rangoon was ~$17 (with a tip, because you shouldn't take it out on the peons), and the food was really not very good.

I'm sort of amazed there aren't better options in town."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm not being fair because I usually don't like Chinese food as a whole, but my take-out experience was sub-par at best. 

I came in late at around midnight and got Mongolian beef with egg-fried rice and an eggroll.

It was definitely not worth $10 in terms of taste or portion size, I was really expecting better. There was also probably more onions then beef which was also annoying.

I would say the only thing this place has going for it is the late night delivery and variety of options. 

Maybe I goofed and didn't order off the \"Our Most Popular Items\" list.

I'm not sure, I'll be very reluctant to try it again, sorry!"}
{"text":"They have the best Chinese food in Vegas. I came across them years ago and have been a regular ever since. Best beef n broccoli in Vegas...NY style! Great lunch combos too! One of my favorite places to eat!"}
{"text":"Great Service and fast delivery. It's one of the only late night options for Chambana and beats the usual fast food. Noodle entrees are my favorite and spring rolls too. Convenient online ordering makes customizing a snap."}
{"text":"called in for pick up. decently fast. friendly service (college students, seemed like). A LOT OF FOOD. for pretty cheap. good value. not amazing food, but you wouldn't go here for quality dine-in experience anyway.

the only negative was that it's hard to find parking on Green St (legally). I temporarily parked in the residence parking behind the restaurant since I was just picking things up... but they deliver, so I guess that's an option. 

Def my new go-to for Chinese latenight cravings. :)"}
{"text":"Really loved the food. It was all fresh and tasted delicious. I love Chinese food and can say this is some of the best I have ever had. So glad it is next to my house.

I had shrimp fried rice smothered in duck sauce. They also had a great egg drop soup that stayed hot throughout the whole meal. I would definitely recommend d chopstix for Chinese food lovers."}
{"text":"I have gone here when I was going to Massage School next door and I found that they are really great. I love the cream cheese-crab wontons."}
{"text":"I ordered Mongolian beef and I think I got Mongolian onions and beef as a garnish. I think there were a total of 5 pieces of meat in that dish. I admit the onions tasted pretty good, but almost 10 dollars for a pile of cooked onions is pretty ridiculous."}
{"text":"I was expecting to see a bunch of two-star reviews, so now I feel badly, but... 

I was hella thrilled for midnight Chinese with my sister after we got off work.  I was hella not thrilled that the wonton soup was straight up the most ridiculous soup ever.  The wontons were MASSIVE... which should be GOOD... except that they were nearly impossible to eat based on their size (not a big deal) and almost tasteless.  I mean, these wontons are massive, but had the same amount of meat as a wee-wonton.  The broth was nearly tasteless.

We also shared the Szechuan pork which came in a huge portion, but really tasted like veggies and a little pork with teriyaki sauce.  Still, not expensive, huge portions, open late."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love it. Consider it's literally 2 minutes from my house.
It was generic Chinese. Nothing special. Totally disappointed by the Gyoza :("}
{"text":"I've been to this Chopstix a few times now and I'll be a regular customer in the future.

My favorite dish is the Mongolian beef. It's one of the best I've had in Vegas. Good beef to veggie ratio. Perfectly cooked. Spicy but not too hot.

I get it on their combo plate special with Chicken fried rice and an egg roll. It's more than enough to fill me up and an exceptional value. The Chicken fried rice is very good and they give you a large portion.

The only downside of the meal is the disappointing egg roll. The filling is mushy and pretty bland. Plus it's more of what I would call a spring roll than an egg roll. 

Service has been quick and friendly. I usually order to-go but the restaurant is pleasant and clean looking."}
{"text":"I haven't and will NEVER eat here! Has been shut down multiple times for health code violations and there are multiple pictures showing vermin in their food! How they are still up and running is beyond me. So sickening!!!!"}
{"text":"This place bills itself as \"New York Style\" Chinese food.  Does that mean their menu is pretty rad?  Yes.  Does it mean those 90 different ads on their countertop?  Maybe, it's like a subway.  Is it the giant portions for low prices?  No, because nothing in NYC is under $50.  But together, it means it is a pretty good place to have lunch.    Skip the Kung Pao though, it's more peanuts than actual other products."}
{"text":"I love this place! I love that they also deliver. When we can't figure out what we wanna eat we usually get delivery from here. Also it's very convenient that you're able to order online as well. 

We always order the orange chicken, it's probably the best main entree. It comes in a pretty good size container. Definitely enough for 2 people to share. It's not too tangy or anything. 

Another thing I order is the cream cheese crab ragoons. I was never a fan of ragoons till I tried theirs!

Also we usually get the chicken fried rice as well. That sometimes comes with excessive amounts of sprouts sometimes, but I usually pick them out if there's too many. And the house lo mein is amazing. Be sure to mix the noodles around and get the sauce off the bottom cause if you eat the bottom in the end it'll be salty surprise. But once you mix it then it's not bad."}
{"text":"Very good Authentic food. Asked for as spicy as possible and they nailed it. Not Americanized hot. AUTHENTIC Chinese hot ! I will be eating here again. Great Job !!!"}
{"text":"Great customer service and the food isn't that greasy like most Chinese places. My favorites here are their boneless bbq ribs which is basically char siu and their egg foo yung, the gravy is on point! So yummy!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The shrimp pad Thai is really good. Service is awesome and very friendly."}
{"text":"I love Chinese food! There are so many places to get Chinese food in Las Vegas but Chopstix is now my go to place. Their menu is simple while also giving you many options allowing you to make a combo with two entrees that you enjoy. I tried their Mongolian beef combo with Lo Mein the first time I went their. It's was delicious! It does have a little spicy kick to it but it was very good. For under $10, you get a meal that is very filling. If you like Chinese food, you definitely have to try Chopstix."}
{"text":"Just the typical Chinese food. Got good reviews because the food was delivered warm and met expectations. Will be our routine Chinese delivery place since we live so close. The delivery time could've been improved.  We literally live around the corner and the delivery took over 50 mins.  But overall this place is good."}
{"text":"We went here the week they opened. Staff was nice but food wasn't anything to rave about. The Singapore noodles tasted fine but the curry seasoning was too strong for my mom's liking. The shrimp lo mein was ok but tasted a bit salty. Don't get me started on the fried rice. The fried rice had no flavor to it and was drowning in chopped onions.

Maybe I'm just being harsh because there used to be a Yummy Grill next door but this doesn't hit the spot like other Chinese restaurants in the Henderson area."}
{"text":"Very friendly. Food is delicious and hot. Great place. Our favorite. Delivery is always hot and fres."}
{"text":"A completely basic plain jane ghetto ass chinese take out place. If you eat in you get to eat with plastic forks and foam plates. Food was so-so and prices were cheap. Its obvious they put approx $0.00 into interior decor. Not bad if you want quick chinese take away. Be prepared to hit a restroom exactly 3.2 seconds after eating. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Best orange chicken on campus. Pretty quick delivery and open late."}
{"text":"This place is so delicious! The girls from work and I eat from here often. Their lunch specials are perfect, the price is low, the portions are huge and there is always leftovers..all for only 6.00!"}
{"text":"My roommate and I were craving chinese take out, and we had no idea where to go! We found chopstix on yelp, and decided to try it. Wow!! You get so much food for such a cheap price! The value is great, and the food is excellent! I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I was hopeful that I would enjoy this place after reading all the reviews. I found the food bland and uninteresting. So back to my search for a decent Chinese restaurant in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a place in East Mesa with good Pho- Tried ChopStix, and was not disappointed. Even though, they only have one type of Pho, they did it right. (I usually like the crazy Pho with tendons, ligaments, and pork blood..don't knock it till you've tried it).  My gf got sushi, which was surprisingly good. Will most def visit, and update my review once i have tried more-"}
{"text":"Oh man. I hate giving bad reviews, but the food was SO BAD. 
Knowing that we'd be ordering from here, I called a few days in advance to make sure that they'd be able to accommodate my dietary restrictions. They were VERY nice and very helpful. And when I ate their food I didn't have to spend the rest of the day in the bathroom, so they also listened and didn't put any of my allergens in the food. 

That said, the food was really pretty nasty. A lot of the people in our group took a few bites, and then went and got food from starbucks for lunch instead. It also had so much MSG in it that we all felt really bad afterwards. I'm pretty sensitive and it makes me super tired, which isn't fun when you're presenting all afternoon!"}
{"text":"I won't be going to too many other Chinese fast food restaurants now after finding this place.  Not much to look at on the outside, but it's what's on the inside that counts!  This place has your typical Chinese restaurant prices, but they definitely make it worth it!  Chopstix doesn't cheat you out of quality or quantity like many other places charging the same prices... They don't add an unnecessary amount of celery and/or peanuts, and their seafood and meat is of quality worth trying for yourself.

All in all...

Great quality, great quantity, friendly staff, fast service.  They will make you wonder why you've gone anywhere else!"}
{"text":"I am really disappointed with this place. Right when we walked in we noticed two flies buzzing around and that should have been a sign for us to leave. But we decided to just order the chicken wings and that was it. The man who took our order was friendly but he had body odor. That was another reason why we should have left. People working in the food industry should not have BO! Our order didn't take long and when we got in the car, my boyfriend made a comment about the bag food smelling like fish, and he was right. I, too, could smell fish. We got it home and we each took a wing, ate it and it tasted like fish. I think they used the same oil they cooked fish in to fry the chicken wings. I don't think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place is so popular... well I guess it's because of the late night hours. I didn't have high expectations, but it seems like a really unclean restaurant... the General Tsos I had was gross and I just don't know..."}
{"text":"Always great service and the food is always fresh. We love the way they carefully package the food. This is our go-to take out for Chinese. We used the online ordering service for the first time and we were very pleased with the service. Have tried most of the menu items, never had a bad one. The war wonton is my favorite."}
{"text":"On vacation to Las Vegas, staying in Henderson and was craving Asian food for a late dinner. Initially, I was looking for Thai food but it seemed like all joints closed at 9:00pm. Chinese food is often hit-or-miss. The star rating on Yelp was not above 4 so do I take a risk? I was lucky on the Strip today so why not roll the dice one more time baby! I could've picked up my order but didn't want to lose my hotel parking spot. Chopstix offers delivery for a $2.50 fee and minimum order, so it was convenient. Yelp delivery confirmation said 45-60 minutes. My food was delivered to my hotel room within 30 minutes. Chicken with garlic sauce and Triple Delight are standard Chinese dishes. They were well prepared with generous portions, each came with better than usual white rice. Meat and veggies cooked perfectly and sauces were tasty and not oily. Suitable for Western and Asian palettes. Feel full and satisfied, not yucky. Although these dishes are very similar, next time I'll order more contrasting selections. Under-rated local Chinese restaurant deserves higher star rating and your business. You won't be disappointed. Sorry no photo. I finished eating before I could grab my camera ;) Yum!"}
{"text":"I made a review about 5 years ago about how fabulous this place is, and I am writing today to re-affirm myself.

I've had Chopstix a few times in the last couple months--always enjoyed things-- but wanted to speak specifically to this evening's experience. My roommate and I used the online app (zero issues), and the website told us to expect an hour wait. Not kidding-- the delivery guy called me TWENTY MINUTES AFTER I PLACED MY ORDER that he was getting out of his car in the POURING RAIN in the middle of the biggest Chicago Cubs game of the last century (I share this because we expected the wait to be even longer given so many people looking for food for such an eventful night). 

We ordered egg drop soup (great for a cold), crab Rangoon which is undoubtedly the BEST RANGOON IN TOWN, and some chicken/beef entrees with delicious pork fried rice. I even had a positive fortune cookie :) Oh and I have enough leftovers for at least lunch, if not dinner as well tomorrow.

A lot of establishments in CU don't give a crap about customer service; these folks stand out for their kindness, attention to detail, and commitment.

Cheers to Chopstix!!"}
{"text":"Nice people, good food, reasonable prices.  I ate here a few times.  Consistent quality.  If you are shopping at the nearby Walmart, have no fear. Stop by and try the General Tso combination plate."}
{"text":"Overall a pretty good neighborhood Chinese joint...  For food - the wonton soup is good.  The potstickers have good flavor and they give you more than normal. Fried Rice is subpar.  I recommend this place if your craving Chinese food and don't feel like leaving the neighborhood."}
{"text":"If you are looking for good Chinese food, then look elsewhere. However, if it's 3 in the morning in CU and you need your fix of Sesame Chicken,  Lo-Mein, or Crab Rangoons then this place has your answer! Some of the other dishes load up on vegetables and give you very little protein considering the prices they charge, so make sure to check before ordering! 

Mediocre Chinese takeout for above average prices."}
{"text":"Because the nail shop next door was super busy, my family decided to wait for me in the car. Once I finished, I got in the car and they quickly started telling me that we should go here for lunch, because they are busy. They said there was a lot of foot traffic and people were ordering food for delivery, because they've seen 3 delivery guys come and go over the last half hour. Knowing that I Yelp, they told me to check and see what people are saying about it, so I did and noticed a few recent one star reviews. Now for the record, I take some one star reviews with a grain of salt, especially those where this is their one and only review or you look at their profile and notice that they have written 20 one and two star reviews.

So anyway, we went in thinking it was set up buffet-style and we'd pick our goodies through the glass case and go, but nope! You go in, order, they cook it, and then you have the choice of eating there or taking it to go. They have a menu that is full of all kinds of dishes! 

For appetizers, you can choose from 12 different choices, from Pork Egg Rolls ($1.50 for 1), Cream Cheese with Crab Wontons ($4.95 for 6) and BBQ Boneless Spare Ribs ($6.25), Beef Teriyaki Sticks ($5.95 for 5), or Pan Fried or Steamed Dumplings ($5.95 for 9). They even have the Pu Pu Platter, which is a combination of several appetizers ($9.95 and enough for 2 people).

They have soups like Vegetable with Tofu ($4.75 for a qt.) and Wonton Soup (pt. $2.95/qt. $4.75). Chop Suey, which is like Chow Mein Noodles comes in six different choices, including chicken, vegetable, and shrimp. The Fried Rice, Lo Mein, Chow Fun, Pad Thai, and Egg Foo Young all come in similar choices. There are several chicken dishes, from Kung Pao Chicken, Curry Chicken, and Salt and Pepper Wings to Lemon Chicken and Chicken with Garlic Sauce. There are also several beef and shrimp dishes available. 

Chopsticks also has 12 different Chef's Special dishes, including Orange Beef ($9.75), Pineapple Crispy Shrimp ($11.25), Honey Walnut Shrimp ($11.95), and something called the Dragon and Phoenix (shrimp w/chili sauce on one side and General Tso's chicken on the other $10.75). They also offer several healthy options and can cater to vegetarian diets. They can alter any dish to make it mild or more than the normal spicy. You just tell them what you want.

They serve family dinners that come with soup, several appetizer options and two full entrées (Option A $24.90 and Option B $28.90). They also offer party trays for very reasonable prices and have a menu of 20 different Combination Plates, which come with chicken fried rice and a spring roll. The choices include everything from Orange Chicken ($7.25), Pepper Steak w/onion ($7.55), and Sweet & Sour Pork (7.25) to Shrimp w/lobster sauce (7.95), General Tso's Chicken (7.25), and Shrimp Lo Mein ($7.95). I was also glad to see that they have a good sized menu of Lunch Specials that run daily, not just Monday through Friday! These specials are available from opening until 4pm Monday through Sunday. There are 21 choices ranging from $6.25 to $7.95.

We ordered three combination plates; the Sweet and Sour Pork, Broccoli and Beef, and Kung Pao Chicken. The servings were large and more than enough! We each tried the others dish and all of them were delicious. I like that the Sweet and Sour Pork had the sauce on the side. I don't know if they put it on there for those who sit and eat, but I appreciate it being on the side for to-go orders, so that it's not soggy by the time you eat it. The Broccoli and Beef were so flavorful and tender and I loved that there was enough sauce in there. I ordered the Kung Pao Chicken with no peanuts. I am not a fan of nuts in food (hee...hee...no pun intended). Anyway, it was very good, but I should have had them make it spicier. At the time, I didn't know that you could. I wish that their containers (reusuable plastic ones, by the way...thumbs up!!) Had a separation, because my rice soaked up most of the sauce. It wasn't all that bad, because it was really flavorful with the rice, but I would have liked to have more of that sauce for my chicken and veggies. 

Chopsticks is located in the busy Walmart center, closer to Red Lobster and the corner of Marks and Sunset Road. They take all credit cards, including American Express and they have great hours; Monday through Friday 10:30am to 10:00pm and Saturday and Sundays 11:00am to 10:00pm. They also deliver to your home or hotel, within a reasonable distance!"}
{"text":"The food was OK but it was dry the building was filled with cheep patches in the wall which made the building look ghetto and run down and lastly there bathroom was disgusting. I nearly though up walking in"}
{"text":"Awesome shrimp lobster sauce. The spring roll is one of the best I had in recent times. You will be surprised at the price of the menus, it's very reasonable."}
{"text":"$1 Sushi, wtf??!?!?  Ok, so I tried this place after I overheard two people talking about it in a restaurant one night.  They said it was a GREAT spot, and they were right!  I couldn't believe the price, $1 for a nigiri piece, $3 for a standard tuna roll or spicy tuna (8 piece).  It's mostly a take-out spot and does not offer much in the way of decor, but when I can get an entire sushi meal for $10.81 (haha, I go way too much), who cares?

Their fish is always fresh and the size of the pieces are just fine, especially for $1.  You can't complain.  I'm here 2x's a week on average and completely hooked.  I usually call on my way home, place my order, pick up, and go home to enjoy.  They now even have Tamari wheat-free soy sauce!  (on request)

They have a variety of specialty rolls as well that vary in price from $3 - $7.  They also serve a sort of Vietnamese-Chinese fusion menu with spring rolls, Pho, stir-fry, etc...  I haven't tried anything there except for the sushi, but people seem to enjoy it.

I highly recommend this place.  Again, go for the food, not the atmosphere.  The sushi chef, John, is very cool too.  Nice guy and very personable.  Makes you feel at home."}
{"text":"Great food here. Must try the shrimp pad Thai. Ordered on yelp and everything was ready to pick up in minutes"}
{"text":"Ordered food and had delivered. It was fast fresh and the food was great. Ordered a family meal for about $25. It was fabulous and more food than we could eat. Ate on it for 3 days. Great Job!!! Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"Love this place! Had dinner last night delivered hot and well made. The Singapore Noodles are awesome as well as the Veggie Egg fu Yung. I have never had bad food from this location."}
{"text":"My mom and I were waiting for massages next door and decided to grab a bite here at Chopstix.

There wasn't too much that was special about this place. Since it was during lunch time, I ordered the Chicken Broccoli Lunch Special. What I appreciated about my food is that it was made with lots of garlic! Yum!

The environment was rather... drab. Though the booths and chairs were all clean, but it felt like they designed the place so that customers are encouraged to want to take food out instead. 

After I left, I realized they never included my egg roll with my lunch special! For that, I give them 2 stars instead of 3!"}
{"text":"This has been possibly the worst Chinese food experience I've ever had.  This is my second time giving this place a try, the first time I gave them benefit of doubt cause it was close to closing time and they seemed rushed, it's now 1pm, middle of lunch hour and I'm the only person here, should have taken that as a sign.... The fried rice was dry and had 0 flavor. The General Tso's was horrid, and the 2 pieces of broccoli in it were still frozen in the middle.  Never coming here again."}
{"text":"Came here last Sunday and fell in love with the Mongolian Beef that I had to come back again before I head back home to California . Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Super friendly service and delicious food.   I got the house chow fun and an order of spring rolls to go.  It wasn't busy and I didn't habe to wait long.  This is close by my place so I'm sure i will be back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"I love this place. Convenient and the price is right. Get the wonton soup and the pork chow mein and thank me later

Plus they deliver and are on the EAT24 app"}
{"text":"They have great deals and plenty of food enough to share family style. Order a few dishes and your good to go.
Orange chicken is yummy Fried rice too. Cashew chicken and even the beef broccoli."}
{"text":"Went here a week ago and placed an order online, tell me why the ready time said it would be ready at this time, but when I got there at that time, it was another 20 min wait? Upon that wait, they forgot that I was still there for my order and also forgot a food item and put something completely different in my bag. They also double charged me on my order when I told them I paid online!!"}
{"text":"It doesn't make any sense how good it is and how cheap it is either. The fish is SO good! 

They tend to get very busy at lunch and dinner, every day of the week. It's best to call your order ahead of time otherwise you could be waiting 20-30 minutes depending on how many people are ahead of you. 

That being said, the quality the fish for the price is excellent. I'm a fish snob, I admit it. I've encountered some disgusting fish in the Valley calling itself quality sushi. It doesn't matter if it's expensive or cheap, I've seen it all. 

Chopstix definitely isn't one of those places. They have great rolls. Some of the mayo sauces are a bit thick for my liking so I just order everything without it. Their miso is pretty tasty and most importantly, their sushi is $1 a piece and the sushi rice is perfect. You can't beat it for the price."}
{"text":"Chinese Fast Food has a lot of flavor and Chopstix was no exception. 

However... I was sick and just wanted to fill my tummy with something that I assumed had lots of flavor to finally just taste ANYTHING again. Garlic Chicken with rice definitely gave my tastebuds a kick in the _____! 

It was good and cheaper than Panda, so I will definitely be coming here again."}
{"text":"If you are looking for late night Chinese, Chopstix is pretty much your only option. It gets a whole star just for that fact alone! Otherwise their food is pretty much OK. It's not a place I would seek out necessarily but it's not bad. Lo mein is one of my favorite dishes and theirs can sometimes be a little dry. But it still does the job!"}
{"text":"Was not expecting this amazing dish. I got the tofu pad thai and it was phenomenal! Great service with excellent food. This place is a must try!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food! Service was fast and staff were polite. Loved the beef in garlic sauce, the meat was soft and had that authentic taste I used to savor back home in Asia. I'm excited to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"I ordered Kung pao chicken, I got rubber in gravy. I did not ask for rubber in gravy. Do not bother with this restaurant."}
{"text":"We go here whenever we're craving some EXCELLENT General Tso's Chicken.  Food is always ready fast and the chicken is always crispy! :-D  We also have yet to be disappointed by any of their other menu items either!"}
