{"text":"Je suis allé à quelques reprises aux 3 restos Ottavio et je prends toujours les Linguines Capiccole et poires je n'avais jamais été déçu mais hier sur Marcel Laurin elles étaient ordinaires... Pour le prix 19$ , ont-ils changés la recette?"}
{"text":"good food, service slow but acceptable, decor is alright, but some bench could use a change"}
{"text":"Ottavio's has an extensive regular and gluten free menu. The servers were very accommodating and knowledgable about the menu and food allergies. 

We will go here again."}
{"text":"Tout est très bon et le service toujours fantastique . Merci à Jonathan notre serveur de ce soir pour la qualité de son service. Nous n'avons jamais été déçu par nos visites à ce resto. Experience à vivre ."}
{"text":"J'ai été plusieurs fois à ce resto. et je trouve que c'est un endroit sympathique. La nourriture y est bonne, les prix sont très raisonnable et en plus c'est un restaurant apportez votre vin :)
Le service est impeccable, et il y a une grande diversité de plat (des moules, des pâtes, des pizzas, etc...)
Personnellement, entre amies je trouve ce resto très bien :)"}
{"text":"A gluten free haven!  Friendly, well informed service, extra precautions with every detail.  An inexpensive, delicious gluten free and regular menu.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The food tastes good. I will say, I am VERY picky with noodles/pasta but I always enjoy it at Ottavio. It really does taste like homemade pasta. It's casual dress but the restaurant (Ottavio St. Leonard) itself is quite beautiful however, it's so dark! You can barely see the food on your plate, let alone the people you're with. If you're having a party of some sort & plan to take pictures - just make sure your flash is on the highest option."}
{"text":"J'ai essayé le resto pour la première fois aujourd'hui & je n'ai pas été déçue. J'y suis allée pour dîner avec mon copain. 

L'accueil et le service étaient courtois et efficaces. J'ai beaucoup aimé le fait que la serveuse nous questionne sur nos allergies dès notre arrivée. L'ambiance était relax, mais le resto est assez chic pour une date. 

J'ai commencé avec une salade du jardin, la vinaigrette était simple mais très bonne. Nous avons tous les deux pris l'option de faire nos propres pâtes. L'attente était un peu longue malgré le fait que l'endroit n'était pas si bondé, mais nos pâtes valaient l'attente! La sauce arrabiata était très bonne et bien épicée. Les portions étaient assez généreuses; j'ai dû rapporter le reste de mon plat. 

Le prix était intéressant en formule du midi, environ 35$ avec taxes pour nous deux. Nous allons clairement y retourner!"}
{"text":"Excellent BYOB a few blocks from the Montmorency Metro 

Travellers to Montreal rightly gravitate to the island and rarely stray far afield. As such they pay a heavy premium for downtown convenience. For those in the know (and possession of an OPUS card) Laval is a 25 min ride on the excellent Metro and is the centre of a burgeoning restaurant culture, as exemplified by Ottavio 

This chic space (tucked into a mini mall) packed with locals wouldn't look out of place in any major downtown. Appetizers are outstanding, the duck trio salad exceptional value and the moules & frites fresh & tasty. Add terrific pizzas and pastas, the ability to bring a great bottle (or 2) of your own wine and Ottavios (at about $25 CAN) really can't be beat."}
{"text":"The service staff was efficient and firendly with us. We actually had no reservation and we were accomodated on a friday night- when it usually gets really packed (I highly recommend that you make reservations in advance), as I witnessed with my own two eyes how fast it fills-up. I went to the location in St.Laurent and I thought I should clarify this, because I am not familiar with the other locations, yet. It was actually my first time. So for a BYOW, Ottavio does it right, but you get what you pay for- borderline microwave food. Ottavio, unlike the other BYOWs, made a decision to to be the low price leader- which is obviously appreciated, because they pack the house. In St. Laurent I found the clientele to be really enjoyable with a nice mix of every type and size of group: Families, families with a well behaved kids, friends, couples- everything. And everyone seemed to be having a great time. So the ambiance was very pleasant overall. The decor is fun and lively on a big scale and it serves as a refreshing background to enjoy a casual BYOW meal, but the orange seats need serious spot treatment and brushing- look twice before you sit down. Pizzas are 2/5(can sauce-high salt, commercial doe, average quality cheese), appetizers like the spicy shrimp are fun. You get a boat load of mini-shrimps in a smokey tomato tapenade sauce, surrounded by a puff pastry bowl. The biegnets for dessert are tastey 3/5, but it could definitely use more than one dipping sauce. Like a hazelnut chocolate, instead of just creme fraiche. Yes, most of the food is mass produced and distributed amongst the multiple locations. I will resist the comparison to l'Academie- bec they only have BYOW in common. But if I had to choose a byow tomorrow- it would be l'academie. Back to Ottavio, they really have a solid system and a flexible menu to accomdate everyone's tastes. Mussels are available in about 8 different styles. Just keep in mind that Laval is the original, followed by St.Laurent and finally their latest addition in St. Leonard. If possible, go for the newer locations like St.Laurent and St.Leonard to get the latest interpretation of their concept. P.S. the coffee is boiling hot- so hot, that the coffee grounds became burnt and ruined the whole coffee, which took me 8 mins to find out, since it was so damn scolding. Oh well."}
{"text":"I'll be honest, I expected to like Ottavio, but I wasn't prepared for how much I would love it. As someone who has been a diagnosed Celiac since 2008, I've found that almost too many restaurants now serve 'gluten free' food, but haven't necessarily trained their staff to know what that means. I often worry at chain restaurants about cross contamination - or worse - that I'm getting entirely the wrong thing. 

At Ottavio, the back of the menu lists all gluten free items and explains that they've provided a Celiac-friendly menu since 2007 (i.e. Before it was cool). I was immediate more at ease.

The server brought me gluten free bread as a starter. It was on the house and - wait for it - served piping hot as opposed to dried out and terrible. My partner (a typical gluten eater who no longer sees bread as a novelty) had originally declined his serving, but after stealing a few bites of mine, he decided he definitely wanted his own bread.

I had the granite (or garlic bread with cheese if you're from outside of Montreal) and GF Californian pizza. The crust was good - maybe a little dry, but very satisfying with a ton of goat cheese. Everything came quickly. The portions are big and I left with half a pizza for lunch tomorrow so that we could save room for dessert - crème brule. To top things off, it's BYOW."}
{"text":"We came to Montreal to visit an old friend of mine who is on a work visa and about everywhere he took us we were blown away by the food. This place was no exception. I love Italian food, and as soon as we walked in just from the ambiance of this restaurant I knew the food was going to be good. 

Another culture shock for us was the BYOB policy, so we grabbed a couple bottles of our own wine and brought them in with us. The calamari was excellent, as well as the bread served before the meal. 

My favourite food is Lasagna so I had to order this here. It was one of the best dishes I had ever eaten at an Italian restaurant. Compared to the other restaurants we checked out during our stay the prices of this place were much more reasonable. Add to that a very romantic atmosphere, your own wine service, and delicious Italian dishes and this place marked one of our best dinners out in Montreal."}
{"text":"Honnêtement, j'étais un peu retissant d'aller chez Ottavio puisque j'aime rarement les \" chaînes \" de restaurant, mais j'ai été agréablement surpris!

Nous y sommes allés en famille et j'ai été très impressionné par la déco, le personnel qui était très courtois et qui connaissait très bien leur menu!

Parlant de menu, c'est assez varié, avec une très belle attention pour les gens sensibles au gluten. Dans mon cas, j'ai pris les pâtes cheveux d'ange Brie et canard fumé, c'était original et délicieux!

PS: Ne faites pas comme moi et n'oubliez pas que c'est un apportez votre vin! ;)"}
{"text":"Food and service at this branch are within my range of satisfaction. I would say the overall dining experience with my parents and husband was nothing \"Wow\" but we left a good tip for the service. 

We wanted the mussel for our starters but they were out of mussel that evening. 

We will be back one day."}
{"text":"I was craving Italian for lunch and since there's not many options for Italian in Ville  Saint Laurent  I gave this place a try. Big mistake! The pasta was under seasoned and was so over cooked it was like eating baby food. If you want Italian, this is definitely not even close to being authentic. Only reason why I'm giving two stars is because the service was pretty good. It may seem cheap, but after adding the options it's becomes super expensive for food court quality Italian."}
{"text":"Tout ce qui manquait c'était un peu de vin... eh oui ! c'était un apportez votre vin et nous n'avions pas prévu le coup. too bad :(

Sinon, Ottavio est une belle petite découverte, cachée dans Anjou : un resto au décor moderne ou on y sert des pâtes et des pizzas, du veau et autres spécialités italiennes. Nous avons pris tous les deux une salade césar en entrée, délaissant l'énorme plateau de calmars pour une fois, et avons opté pour des pâtes pour la suite des choses. La lasagne a la viande était fondante, la sauce tomate avait ce petit goût acidulé du ' fait maison '. La serveuse m'assure que tout est fait maison a la location a Laval, mais que tous les matins une cargaison leur arrive prête a servir. 

Pas de desserts pour nous, mais un café latté un peu froid, mais assez bon. Le service était a la hauteur du reste."}
{"text":"Great place with amazing service. I once had a problem with one of the dishes and they made sure to fix it right away. I love that they have the dairy free cheese option and the gluten free choices on the menu! Great for people with intolerances and allergies :)"}
{"text":"The pizza here is really good & the pastas too! The service was outstanding!!! So much so that we let the manager know!!! The deco. Is really nice & perfect place to celebrate a special occasion friends or to check before hitting the clubs!!"}
{"text":"I came in on the day they had a special on the veal, so I necessarily needed to try it. It was priced quite high at around 28$ CAD and had many high-end ingredients listed, so I expected truly a top class dish. To my greatest disappointment, I received something that came out of a  school cafeteria. It looked completely unappetizing, was overly salty and the flavors simply didn't work. I was truly disheartened to see such wonderful ingredients used in a pitiful way.

My friend ordered a pizza, and I have to say, it almost looked like a frozen pizza from the super market. It was definitely not worthy of being called a true Italian pizza.

Near the end, the waiter also began ignoring us and refilled our bread basket with only 2 breads when we were 6 people seated. 

Will not come back."}
{"text":"The food was really good. We had Poulette mussels, some other mustard mussels and the special pizza. The one that changes every month. This month it was figs, pesto, mozzarella, and honey. The service was a but slow but still good. I also had a creme brûlée it was amazing! 
It's just good Italian food... Nothing amazingly special. 
I would go back."}
{"text":"This is in regard to the Ottavio in Ville St-Laurent, which is the same restaurant in another location in Montreal.

I don't give too many 5's, but this place is just great and deserving of 5 stars.  One of my favorite attributes of this restaurant is that you can bring your own wine.  My other favorite is that they have great food.

When we moved here, we found it difficult to go out for dinner, because my wife has a gluten allergy and we don't speak french.  A friend of ours happened upon Ottavio, due to their gluten free menu options, and invited us along.  Since then, we have become regulars here.

Again, they have great food, from Italian favorites like pizza and pasta to traditional Quebecois fare like mussels and fries.  My wife and I usually start our meal by splitting either  a caesar salad (gluten free) or the eggplant tower (gluten free).  The appetizers are large and good for two.  For the main course, I typically get a pizza.  There are multiple options for toppings, perhaps 12 pizza alternatives.  They are cut into 4 quarter slices and easily reduced to 8 slices.  My wife either gets the mussels and fries or a gluten free pizza.  For pasta, they have lasagna, spaghetti, and a series of pastas with tomato, rose, alfredo or pesto sauce.  Accompanying the dinner is complementary bread which is not gluten free.

It is important to note that among their gluten free options, they have pizza, pasta and mussels available.  If you opt for gluten free, they provide you alternative silverware, and they even have gluten free soap in the restroom.

They have two seatings, early and late.  The early seating is around 6 and the late seating is around 8, although you can go in between seatings without a reservation."}
{"text":"We came to Ottavio after a hellish afternoon being snowed in the motel on our engagement trip. What a difference this place made! I should say that I have Celiac, so we picked this place because of the gluten-free options. For starters, I've never seen gluten-free cutlery before. What a great change of pace! They even had a gluten-free bread available for me before our food came out. I'm used to watching my fiancé eat the complimentary bread that I'm allergic to in front of me while making related puns. I got a gluten-free bolognese which was delicious! A good balance of sauce and herbs, and not too dense like a lot of gluten-free noodles can be. My partner got the spicy sauce with chicken pasta, which he reported as being \"moy caliente\". I had to remind him everyone speaks French here, not Spanish. Even the packing up of leftovers was different, as the hostess brought over a container for me to ensure no cross-contamination issues. Five stars, thanks for your enlightening Celiac procedures and options."}
{"text":"I would leave it as it is not a very authentic Italian Restaurant but will do the job for a quick lunch..."}
{"text":"For a small franchise in the burbs, this place is pretty good. The quality is consistent and predictable, which gets them bonus points. They have a gluten-free menu and whole wheat options too. Finally, it's BYOW and they have mussels and fries!

My favorite dish here is the lasagna - delicious! Add courteous service and decent prices, not to mention easy parking, and this becomes a no-brainer!"}
{"text":"Ottavio is a nice little resto in the heart of St. Laurent. I have seen a lot of family and work gatherings here. The service is always good and they make a point of asking if anyone has any allergies (something I think all restaurants should do). The spicy shrimp is my go to starter. Although it is not that spicy, it has a nice burst of flavor. Their pasta and veggie pizza are also good. For dessert I recommend the chocolate mousse and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. These two desserts together were very enjoyable. I have been to this resto many times and I was never disappointed."}
{"text":"Le rapport qualité/prix est excellent ainsi que le service qui est toujours très bien. La qualité de la nourriture et le goût est incontestablement. Ottavio est toujours un must pour une bonne bouffe Italiano."}
{"text":"A nice evening between girls (mom and cousin) at Ottavio last Friday.

Food was good, service was really nice. Rose was a really attentive waitress and food was delivered in a timely manner.

I will certainly go again!"}
{"text":"Ottavio is an Italian restaurant with a chic ambiance and a BYOW option. For those of you who have ever been to l'Academie, looks pretty much like that. Every Monday to Wednesday they offer unlimited mussels, which is the main reason why I would go there.

To begin, our waitress was nice, but didn't offer us any water until we had to ask, and didn't come back for refills. The table behind me had also complained about her slow service. So there goes a star from me.

Anyway, we started with fried calamari, which was pretty rubbery. Pretty disappointed.

I then got the all-you-can-eat mussels in Thai sauce that came with fries. The mussels were good, but I had expected the sauce to be a tad spicy and more coconut-y, it didn't taste anything like Thai style at all. But the fries were pretty good and I got three different types of mayo with them: original, spicy and garlic.

My friend got the Sicilian pizza. She said that the toppings were good, but the dough didn't tasted fresh, more like frozen pizza. 

We didn't get dessert because it was a nice sunny day and Baskin Roberts was next door, and you can never go wrong with Baskin Robins (yes, I'm slightly advertising for Baskin Robins haha)

Overall, I give it a 3 stars because the setting was very clean and nice, but the service wasn't super and the food was meh. I do however have to give the restaurant major props for having the allergen/gluten free menu and how they would give you a whole new set of utensils with a blue paper strip wrapped around them to indicate that they were, I guess, sterilized. Not many restaurants consider customers who have a hard time eating out because of their intolerance/allergy and that's something I give mad respect too.

I would return for the all-you-can-eat mussels and probably try another sauce, but would recommend somewhere else for an authentic Italian meal."}
{"text":"Decent food, good service. For me, seating is important in a restaurant. How it feels and where it's located. Hence the 4 stars. Despite having limited choices on the menu in terms of types of food, there is a gluten free option."}
{"text":"Went to ottavios on Easter Sunday. We were a group of 20. The service was good. Everyone got their meal at the same time. I had the taco  as an entree that I wouldn't recommend. I had the diable mussel. They were good. The reason why they lost 2 stars is because we were celebrating a birthday and brought a custom cake. They said they were not able to serve our cake because they had a gluten free section to their menu. I'd understand if all the menu was gluten free, but this wasn't the case."}
{"text":"I've NEVER seen a place this dedicated to gluten-free dining! They have special utensils and red plates and napkins for the GF folk and even have a dedicated cooking area for gluten free food where strict measures are taken into place in order to avoid cross contamination.

Perfect choice for gluten free peeps. It's very accessible (it's not downtown but has a large parking lot and is also walking distance to Cote Vertu metro). The ambiance is cozy, modern, open, and warmly lit. I loved the couch booths.

I've been here many many times.. it's great for groups so I've convinced friends and family to have their events here. Love their pizza :) Their home made donuts are perfect for dessert if you're 3-5 people it's great for sharing. 

Bring your own wine, there's an SAQ a 2 min drive away near rue Decarie. Sundays are FREE FOR KIDS! Definitely make a reservation if you're going to be a large group.

Service is hit or miss, so don't be shy to call your waiter if they've been MIA on a busy night."}
{"text":"Went for a dinner with a friend. A beautifully decorated restaurant that offers options of gluten free and food allergy. I debated giving a 3 for a couple reasons. The first, we chose to sit on the couch, which was dirty and had a lot of food crumbs that I had to clean myself. There was only 2 breads with 2 packs of butter. I was quite disappointed that they only offered 2. We asked for more butter, which they brought, a basket full, but no bread. The calamari was good, the marinara sauce was really good. We had the penne arabiatta which was excellent with just enough spice. We also had the opa pizza. Thin crust with olives, feta, tomatoes, onions. The pizza is a fairly decent size but I would not be able to finish it alone. Overall good experience. Really respect that they are considering people with food allergies. You have to ask for water as they don't automatically serve you."}
{"text":"Je dois avouer - ce resto d'Anjou est un peu loin pour cette résidente du centre-ville. Toutefois, c'est une superbe alternative pour un menu italien gourmet sans avoir à se déplacer si on habite dans le Nord-Est de l'Île. Des prix fort raisonnables, formule apportez votre vin, avec une salle à manger bien spacieuse font de l'endroit un choix parfait pour un souper de groupe! J'aime aussi que leurs pâte à pizza et pâtes sont faites fraîches et qu'ils ont une grande sélection du menu disponible sans gluten ou tout autre agents souvent considérés allergènes - chose qui est venu comme une belle surprise pour plusieurs personnes dans notre groupe."}
{"text":"Ma cinquième visite mais mon premier avis 
J'aime bien ce restaurant car le choix du menu se limite aux pizza,pates ou moules mais le résultat est habituellement très bon. 
Les entrées de salade César et de crab Cake sont aussi delicieuses. 
Les prix ne sont pas gonfles parce que c'est un apportez votre vin. 
Cette fois ci nous avons choisi tous les deux les moules. Mon amie les poulettes et Madagascar pour moi. Les siennes étaient delicieuses tandis que les miennes était très crèmes et manquant de goût. De poivre? De gognac? Je ne sais trop mais pas de crème. Nous avons partager un tiramisu. Bon et frais mais de serrer un gâteau dans un pot Masson? Apres les drinks....et les factures, ça commence à faire la mode de tout foutre dans les pots.  
L'espresso etait excellent ainsi que le service par plusieurs personnes et ce sans la moindre erreur. Le point très négatif de ce restaurant est le stationnement presqu'inxesistant. 
Le restaurant est très bruillant mais ça passe un vendredi soir."}
{"text":"Oui, un bel accueil. Oui, des serveurs courtois. Oui, un service rapide. C'est parfait, c'est super. Cependant, un menu pas très varié, des plats sans gluten plus chers, des pizzas avec pâte de blé entier plus chères, des portions un peu trop grosses (heureusement qu'on peut compter sur le doggie bag), mais jamais trop froides. Le genre de resto parfait pour un repas en famille ou en groupe, mais pas en couple parce que c'est bruyant."}
{"text":"Great sampling of seafood, and pasta/pizza, although those with allergies beware: all their baked goods can be contaminated with seafood/fish, yes even the baked brie, bread, non fish related items (!).  I stayed since my group of 8 had all already ordered, although disappointed with the now limited offerings in consequence.  This was a bummer because I had wanted the baked brie appetizer but have a *severe* allergy to anything seafood, so I could not order this.

The A-Roo-Go-La salad was yummy, the Penne Romanoff was only OK, I've had much better.

Although I did not have the dessert, the other members in our group had the creme caramel dessert and said it was yummy.

The service was amazing, great waiter, very friendly and informative, made sure the people who dropped off the food knew I had allergies and not to touch any plate with fish before serving me.

I do not think I will be returning, but not because of the service, but the limited menu options for me."}
{"text":"The food was OK. I got the 10$ pasta but it was tasteless. The waiter was rude. The entire place was empty yet as soon as we were done he came to us and rushed us. You know, if I go to a restaurant with friends, I want to talk, ENJOY the moment. Yet that was impossible because of the waiter. I finished my plate, he didn't even ask if it was good, didn't even ask if we wanted anything else, didn't let us talk and just straight up asked if we want to split the bill and made us pay ASAP. Annoying"}
{"text":"Habituée de l'endroit il faisait un bail que je n'y avais pas mis les pieds. J'y suis allée deux fois dans le denier mois et j'étais on ne peut plus satisfaite. La salade orientale au confit de canard était excellente, goûteuse, gigantesque et bien garnie mais le canard était un peu trop salée. 

Le tartare de boeuf sauce dijonnaise, figues et ect. WOW!!!! Je mange habituellement du tartare de saumon car je n'ai pas aimé ma première expérience de tartare de boeuf. J'ai décidé de lui laisser une seconde chance. Un mot : AMAZING. La viande était bien assaisonnée et pour moi qui a tout de même un bon appétit l'entrée de 3 oz accompagnée de croûtons, d'une salade et un a-coté de frites était suffisant. 

J'ai goûté la pizza d'une des personnes qui m'accompagnaient aussi excellente. Nous étions 4 et sommes sortis tous très satisfait. 

Allez-y"}
{"text":"Très bonne adresse. Je recommande la sauce Rosée! Pâtes et pizzas à composer soi-même. Il y a même un menu vegan et gluten-free."}
{"text":"We selected Ottavio as a place for a group dinner because we wanted a restaurant that is simple that everyone would enjoy and hearty and filling. Also it's BYOB so you know you can control the booze so people don't go too crazy or overboard. This is one way in which you can definitely rack up the bill with some guests that are a bit uncontrollable. As for the food, who in the world doesn't like pizza or pasta? Perhaps you would have to be a frozen caveman or a neanderthal as I don't think I've ever met anyone in my life who doesn't like Italian food. 

Prior to ordering we were warned they had no mussels. Maybe because of the high ice in the Atlantic and storms in the maritimes. Weird as you rarely see mussel shortages. Also the chicken and Veal specials were relegated to specific nights in which we were not on. 

We ordered a bunch of appetizers to start the most enjoyable ones were the calamari and duck poutine. The duck poutine was rich, with a thick brown sauce that was devishly good. The calamari was big tubes but very light and tasty. A friend ordered the crab cakes but I thought there was very little crab meat and didn't taste very good to me. I'm spoiled as I usually eat these in South Carolina where they are usually 100% crab. 

For my main dish I ordered the Sicilian pizza. It was very nice and spicy, came with a huge green pepper and also what appeared to be cut jalapeños with olives and a spicy sausage. Flavour was rich with peppers, tomato, tartness of olive and acidity and heat of the peppers. Very flavourful. Overall the pizza was a solid 4/5. 

Service was friendly, fairly quick and of no issue. The restaurant was modern and with an open kitchen. Overall everyone in our group of 15 seemed satisfied and content with a full belly!"}
{"text":"Office buddies like to grab a bite here every once in a while. We always call for a reservation since it usually gets full at lunchtime. It gets quite noisy so don`t expect a romantic lunch here. Not sure about supper time.

Like others have stated; it is mainly pizzas, pasta and mussels. I have tried both pizza and pastas here, they are ok. Nothing fancy.  Just wish they would add other sélections (like chicken, fish or meats)

I do appreciate the warm little breads but seriously the cold butter served with it, meh.

Service is always quick and friendly. 

Ah yes it is a bring your own bottle."}
{"text":"j adore ce resto faut dire que depuis qu il ont changé le menu un peu déçu je dois dire la classique pizza super de bon gout, salade César et  salade arrugola fantastique bonne portion gouteux les moules a volonté dommage que on peu pas changer de saveur les autres resto le font ca te permet de pouvoir gouter la meilleur saveur les calmars excellent, un apporté votre vin est ideal,cest le bruit je trouve ça déplaisant faut quasiment  levée le ton pour ce comprendre ,faut faire des réservations le personnel trés gentil souriant, mais en général je dois dire c'est un très bon resto oui je le recommande"}
{"text":"One of those restaurants in Montreal where it's classy enough to take your date, and also casual enough for a good value meal while hanging out with friends and coworkers. 

Very classy decors, yet warm and comfortable. Spacious space with open kitchen and the soft glow of the warm lights on orange cushioned walls and white tabletops. We did the pick your own pasta option, you get a piece of paper and do a la carte selection for choice of sauce, meats, and veggies. Something fun to do while waiting for foodz - the tabletop is comprised of white paper and with the pencils, you can go wild with imagination. I certainly had a grand time doodling away on the paper. The time past by fast and the food came in a generous portion plate. The angel hair pasta is fine and al dente, with the arrabbiata sauce, slightly spicy and savory, was perfect. The shrimp was cooked to tenderness and did not retain any of its 'fishy' taste. 

Overall, it was wonderful. Though the food is not extraordinary - still delicious, the value, atmosphere and the option to customize the pasta dish was excellent."}
{"text":"Last Sunday, I was spoiled and was brought to the Restaurant Ottavio in St Laurent for dinner.

It was delicious.  We went on a Sunday night so it was pretty quiet when we first arrived.  Later on during the night, it seemed to get quite full... of children with their parents.  (We found out later on that children eat for free on Sunday nights).

For starters we got the Garlic Bread Gratiné and my date was right- it IS the best cheesy garlic bread I've ever had.

For the main meal, he had Linguine duck cont ...(cream, teriyaki, duck, prosciutto, shallots, sesame seeds) and I had  Angel hair four tomatoes ... (tomato sauce, cherry tomatoes, sun-dried tomatoes, bruschetta, bocconcini).  Oh my gosh, was it good.

IMG_4217 IMG_4218

We both had leftovers because the portion you get is definitely worth the money.

The atmosphere was very comfortable and we were comfortable being a bit dressed up (it was our first official date- very, very nice).  You can make reservations online and they have three locations: Laval, St Laurent and St Léonard.  It IS bring your own wine & beer so keep that in mind!

I will definitely be going back- I will probably want to try every single thing on the menu."}
{"text":"Ok food, the mussel was good , generous portion, service was good and fast. Clean restaurant. Tried the make your own pasta previously , i don't think the food had a distinctive  touch to it, no special flavours or presentation that attract you to be a regular. Good good business lunches. Good overall."}
{"text":"Mon père m'a fait découvrir ce restaurant lui qui est un grand mangeur de moules frites. Nous sommes allés la à l'heure du lunch. Ils vous proposent un menu à 10$ café ou the compris ou vous pouvez composer votre propre assiette de pâtes. J'ai pris des penne avec 3 choix de légumes et sauce rosée. C'était vraiment délicieux et la portion était très généreuse. Mon père a évidemment pris les moules il y avait sur le menu au moins 8 choix de sauce il s'est laissé tenté par la dijonnaise. Les frites étaient bien croustillantes. Bref j'ai vraiment aimé ce restaurant dommage qu'il n'y ai pas une succursale au centre ville surtout qu'il s'agit d'un apportez votre vin!!!!"}
{"text":"Ce que j'aime de ce restaurant c'est qu'on peut choisir nos pâtes ainsi que une panoplie de sauces et de condiments,  nous-mêmes selon un  menu à la carte ou encore prendre un des nombreux choix de plats italiens qui sauront vous satisfaire j'en suis convaincu. De plus la formule apportez votre vin est vraiment agréable d'autant que pour ceux qui vont pour la première fois sachez qu'il y a un dépanneur juste à côté du resto ce qui permet d'apporter un choix de vins un peu limité mais quand même qui comme on dit; dépanne facilement Le service est fort sympathique ambiance du restaurant comme tel est plus que convenable pour un repas à 2 août pour un groupe d'amis qui désirent se joindre alentours d'une bonne bouffe. Le restaurant est situé à lestes de la 15 sur le boulevard Saint-Martin donc on peut s'y rendre facilement d'un peu partout aux alentours."}
{"text":"Quick and courteous service. Large dining area, excellent for large groups. Bring your own wine. Average to loud noise levels. Good selection of dishes, but overall below average in taste and portion sizes for the price. Served bread was lackluster. Good lunch menu. Good place mostly for groups and families, though I'd suggest looking at other Italian restaurants in the area if you are looking for a more authentic Italian experience."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with coworkers. They have a special lunch menu where you can create your own pasta dish for only 10$. I went for spaghetti with the sauce rosée. The portion was really generous, and I was barely able to finish. It was also quite good.
Service was courteous and efficient, would definitely return, but this time, I won't forget to bring a bottle of wine!"}
{"text":"The food was just ok but the service was really good.  I went with a large group and no one was really impressed with the food.  It does offer a nice selection of allergy free meals so if thats your thing him for it. Otherwise, just so-so."}
{"text":"Ottavio se situe au mieux dans le milieu de la liste des restos de Montréal. Le décor est très bien. La bouffe est bonne, sans plus. Le service est VRAIMENT ordinaire 1h pour une pizza... C'est pourtant un tier de leur menu principal avec les pâtes et les moules! Reçevoir comme excuse qu'un nombre extraordinaire de commande de pizza ralenti le service: est un peu comme rire de moi en me donnant une claque! La serveuse a quand même fait ce qu'elle a pu pour sauver la mise, mais elle ne peut pas tout faire... Première & dernière fois."}
{"text":"Les pâtes étaient excellentes! Grâce à leur carte, nous pouvons choisir la forme des pâtes, les ingrédients et la sauce. Le concept est super et la qualité des aliments est soignée. J'ai beaucoup aimé le service, rapide et agréable. Je recommande ce restaurant et je reviendrais à coup sûr lorsque je souhaiterais manger des bonnes pâtes italienne !"}
{"text":"J'y suis été plusieurs fois durant mes dîner. Je trouve que c'est le meilleur moment puisqu'il y à un menu \"fait tes propres pâtes \". Tu choisis le type de pâte. Les légumes et viandes, la sauce, les accompagnements ainsi que ton breuvage. La combinaison la plus cher reviens à moins de 20$, Et ont peu facilement avoir assez d'un 20$ Pour tout payer et laisser un bon pourboire.

Le service est bon, pas vraiment d'attente. On peut avoir des petits pain chaud à volonté gratuitement et il est succulent.

Le soir, C'est autre chose. Cela reste un bon restaurant mais il est plus traditionnel avec un menu avec des choix de plats pré établis. Pas moyen d'avoir le menu personnalisé du midi."}
