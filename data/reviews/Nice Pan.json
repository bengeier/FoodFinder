{"text":"Is this place ever open? I've been multiple times where it's been outright closed or where a sign indicates the owner will be back at X time but then he doesn't show up. On the extremely rare occasion I've seen someone working, the place was packed to the tits. I truly wish I could tell you if the Groupon is worth it but I haven't gotten to the ice cream part yet."}
{"text":"Enjoying are day at the heart of the city when I noticed shaved ice cream . Had to get the wife a cup . 5 stars on the ice cream but the service was Even better . The guy that worked there was great . Full if energy . Dancing and sing while making you ice cream He has talent .  Everybody that stop bought a cup or 2 . Ice cream made on the spot . He pours milk on a cold plate and like magic it turns into ice cream . Add a toping and bang it's done see my clips . A must visit ."}
{"text":"Awesome rolled ice cream pop up in Kensington Market! Very customisable and so much fruits!! :)"}
{"text":"On the day I went, they were out of the chocolate base.  I chose the berry mixture for $6 plus tax. They scoop some frozen fruit and lay it out onto the table where they then dice it up. Once chopped, they pour a bit of the vanilla cream base onto it and incorporated it into the minced fruit until there is a rectangle. Using a scraper they scraped from one end to the other end, coming out with a \"roll\" of ice cream with each scrape.  The rolls were placed into a small cup and then whipped cream was added/sprayed on top of it.  Taste was OK; more a novelty as not a lot of places do it this way."}
{"text":"Had a chocolate ice cream base with blueberries, oreos and nutella, topped with maple syrup and whipped cream. I didn't choose the flavours or toppings for this one, and thought it'd be too sweet for my liking. I was actually pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed the flavour combination. The nutella wasn't overpowering at all, and the maple syrup added bursts of flavour.  I wasn't huge on the texture of the ice cream itself though. It was quite dense and almost chewy. I prefer the texture at Arctic Bites."}
{"text":"Ouuu, tiramisu flavoured ice-cream rolls? Count me in. Friends say this tasted more like a frappucino but I'm not fussed. This was a deliciously light summer dessert that had me all giddy. Love the customizable toppings. Nice Pan uses fresh fruit from the market which is a plus! Looking forward to indulging again soon!"}
{"text":"I've been looking for rolled ice cream for a while now and since the other shop on Kensington is always closed, I was super happy I found this one. I got the vanilla ice cream base with brownie and Nutella topped with dulce de leche and coconut whipped cream. So I wasn't expecting it to be that good and I'm glad I was wrong. I thought that since the ice cream is rolled, it wouldn't be smooth or creamy but that's just what it is. It pretty much melted perfectly and was the perfect consistency. It was 7 dollars but for me it was worth it. The guy who did it for me was also really nice and I enjoyed watching him make it. Overall I had a really good experience and had fun eating it!"}
{"text":"Summer is here and I finally got my rolled ice cream!  It was good and fresh! The taste is way better than regular ice ream bc it's made and served right away.  They work quickly and the service is friendly.  Still $6+ taxes for an ice cream but you won't eat it everyday.  The place doesn't allow to stay... could be improved to make it more attractive.  Worth trying!"}
{"text":"Came here back in mid-October for roller ice-cream. Fairly quick and friendly service and I loved how they don't limit the number of fillings/toppings you can use! They also give you recommendations on what would go well together, which I love for the flexibility but also suggestions! Rolled ice-cream is as much about the experience as it is about the final product and while you do get to watch the whole process, you're standing on the sidewalk essentially, so it can get a little frustrating when there are pedestrians and pets trying to get by. Because of the shop's location, there's also no where to sit and eat, so you'll have to walk and enjoy your rolled icecream.  Overall, I'd consider coming back for a nice treat. The prices are relatively fair, but still on the high end just some ice cream."}
{"text":"- I tried berri-licious which was mixed by three different types of berries: black/blue/raspberries in vanilla based. It did not taste too sour cuz the vanilla base sweetens the sourness of the berries, very fruity and summery. They also gave me Gaylea whipped cream on the side which was very nice. The ice cream texture was not as hard as Artic bite but softer (not too soft to melt easily lol).  - Portion: regular (a bit on the smaller size), they usually give about 5 rolls, can be shared between two people. - Price: $6.20 + tax, I thought it a bit pricey for ice cream but I guessed it's fair since they used fresh fruits and spent much time to mix them together. My friend got the deal on groupon for only $5/cup. - Service was good and fast."}
{"text":"This place is temporarily closed but thought I'll give my reviews.    I came here at the end of October--my friend and I each ordered rolled ice cream.  There are three steps to this.  So basically you pick a base (vanilla or chocolate), filling and toppings.  I chose the vanilla base filled with Oreo, kiwi and pineapple and condensed milk.  I like how they use real fruits.  I enjoyed how the server made the ice cream and it tasted alright.   My friend got vanilla base, mango, pineapple and condensed milk.  I actually liked his ice cream more because it was less sweet and more fruit compared to mine."}
{"text":"Right in middle of Kensington market.  I ordered a strawberry banana flavored combo.  I liked how they used real banana and strawberries. It tasted great, but next time I will probably go for a more chocolatey, whip creamed option. All rolls cost about $7. The lineups however was my main negative comment.  They only had two pans, one of them broke down and they took a cue of about 12 ice creams to make.  Took me about 40 minutes to receive mine that day.  But in the end, the worker offered me a coupon for free ice cream the next time I come around.  The staff was pretty friendly and fun to talk too, which made the wait a little bit easier."}
{"text":"I was taking a stroll in Kensington when I came across this ice cream place. I've had rolled ice cream both in New York and Thailand and absolutely loved the concept. This place did not disappoint! The people that worked there were extremely nice, friendly, and even gave us a free ice cream because they felt like they were taking too long. I definitely encourage everyone to try this out not only for the concept but because it was genuinely good ice cream and I liked the idea of being able to watch it be made."}
{"text":"Love the texture!  I tried the kiwi, pineapple and Nutella and it was fabulous!  They ran out of condense milk . I surprisingly love the texture!!!  I've been to Thailand twice and somehow missed this ice cream phenomenon   I'm actually craving this as I speak!  The person that made it was super nice and was very helpful explaining the flavours and process   Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Came here with my brother and was treated with great service. There was only one person in line which is good because I've seen lots of people waiting. My brother wanted something mango so we got the first signature ice cream rolls. I like it here because they take only cash and it was a flat rate of $7. My brother enjoyed his first Thai inspired ice cream. While they started making his, a line started to form so we were lucky!!"}
