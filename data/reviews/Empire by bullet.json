{"text":"Just called and spoke with the owner regarding a return. I received a pillow with a dog on it that is not to my taste. His policy is exchange only. As this item was $90, I would have understandably preferred a refund. The owner was beyond rude, stating he had over $250,000 then $200,000 worth of merchandise in his store and that I should be able to find something. When I let him know that I did not feel that was an appropriate tone he went off and told me I was insulting his merchandise and his store. Not the case - I said it was not to my taste!! I told him I'd prefer never to shop at his store again if that is how he chose to treat his customers and he said \"that's fine - you're not my customer - you just got it as a gift\". I am flabbergasted and insulted. No customer should ever be treated in this manner. Mr. Stearne - you shouldn't be in the retail business full stop. You're attitude is beyond offensive."}
{"text":"Bought a beautiful pillow for our friends' anniversary; the man at the counter was helpful, patient (there's so much to choose from in this fresh store I had a hard time deciding what to get), and wrapped the gift carefully. Tomorrow I'm heading in for Mr. Kipling Cakes...and I bet he'll be there...as helpful as ever."}
{"text":"Great store!

I love the teas, preserves and candies.  It has a great selection of home decor items as well.  All the things I remember as a child growing up with my Granny!"}
{"text":"I've been into this adorable little shop quite a few times now. I have a British candy addiction. I've been known to eat heap and heaps of Fruit Gums. Ok, it's a Fruit Gums specific addiction. I'll eat a whole package before I even get home from the shop. Don't you dare confuse them with Wine Gums. No comparison.

But I've also been into Empire to pick up some little grocery type things for my Nana and other British relatives. They love it. Christmas Pudding from Marks and Sparks? They had it. Ginger biscuits? The best. Golden Syrup? I couldn't say no. 
I love all the cute little touristy paraphernalia as well. Quirky tea towels and tea cups, or magnets with your fave Coronation street character on them. 
Everything is displayed so nicely and the staff here is just the best. Every time I've been the staff have been so helpful and chatty and friendly."}
{"text":"I've popped into this shop a few times to get greeting cards, and the do have a good selection of off-colour notecards with swears. Because I'm 12 at heart, or something.

They also carry a dizzying supply of brit-specific products - treats and sweets and cakes. I'm sure it's a great resource for expats in the west end.

But, truly - the owner is top notch lovely. I am training a seeing eye-dog pup, and he travels with me most everywhere in his little vest. The owner welcomed us in to the shop warmly, despite the many delicate items he had on display. He brought my dog a bowl of water, which the dog promptly flipped over and spilled accross the hardwood floor.

He laughed, mopped it up, and admonished me to stop apologizing. Nicest. Guy. Ever."}
{"text":"Have been in here to buy a few things, and had the shop keeper lie to us and be quite rude. First we were lied to about buying toffee pudding -- he claimed it was unavailable in Canada but we purchased it elsewhere the following day. On a subsequent occasion we asked about Marmite, and were told lies about availability. We bought it not two hours later at another location. He was quite rude about this as well, and as such we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Just wanted to say kudos to the folks here - I ordered the clotted cream I was searching for - direct from the UK, in time for my tea party.  they are fabulous and accommodating, and there's a great selection of stuff - and more stuff at Keep Me Posted - their sister location across the street!"}
{"text":"Wow! If you are a hard core Anglophile, like myself, and love all things British, then you are going to love this store!!

Located down in ever-so-trendy,darling, Leslieville, I advise you to enter the store and start to slowly take everything in because there's a lot to take in!

For Beatle fanatics, like myself, there are beautiful pillows with the Fab Four and cool fridge magnets. And speaking of fridge magnets, there's an amazing, and ever-changing selection. 

If you're looking for some very inappropriate and hilarious Christmas cards, this is the place to find them, plus some truly unique tree ornaments like Big Ben and a red phone box. Then there's the food. Yes, food! Lots and lots of condiments, snacks and cookies. 

I never walk out of here empty handed, even if it's just a fridge magnet. The owner is helpful and friendly and whoever accused him of being rude, must have got him on a really bad day.

This store is definitely a bit of alright!"}
{"text":"I was happy to see this teeny tiny shop open.  I love British snacks... Walkers crisps?  Yum!  And the massive Cadbury fruit and nut bar is a sure fire hit gift too though my preference is for the Flake.  Honestly, if I didn't save my extra calories for wine, I would be here regularly for treats.

Everything in the store is carefully curated.  It is a pleasure to stop by and look at all the fun goods offered.  Ceramics, pillows, preserves, cordial, soaps, and cleaning products, you name it, if it's British, it's here!

It's totally worth a gander if you happen to be in the neighborhood."}
