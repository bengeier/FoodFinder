{"text":"3 1/2 Good place for all you can eat if you wanna try a lot of different things but if you are going for sushi keep in mind that they are very generous on the rice.  You order on a IPad so it was scary with my 4 y-o and my own clumsiness but we made it through without any accident!  I end up enjoying ordering from it because you didn't have to wait for your server to come take the order at your table and bring it back to the kitchen.   I think it could be worth it during the weekends since there is more interesting choices on the menu."}
{"text":"I love sushi and I'm generally not a very difficult person but the reason to my 3 star rating is due to the actual sushi selection being very small (no yellowtail, no lobster, no crab etc) and most of the their sushi or non-sushi choices have a deep fried coating. Don't get me wrong everybody loves deep fried food but it's not authentic sushi!! And after having a buffet of it I actually felt sick to my stomach. On the upside, the service was quick, the waiters are very polite and the food is well presented. The look and ambiance of the place is fantastic for groups for a night out but also great for a date. As a conclusion, I will come back if they improve their menu!!"}

{"text":"Service is fast, love the idea of iPad ordering. The waiters are very kind and takes times to teach you how to order with the iPad and for each dishes, they will tell you what it is. Affordable, instead of going to Mtl, sushi restaurant right next to my house."}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi, this place is amazing. Every single table have an iPad, you can order whatever you want, the food is excellent."}
{"text":"Bien organisé, manière de commander spéciale (Ipad), très beau et propre et les meilleurs sushis de ma vie !"}
