{"text":"Been coming to Oregano for years.  We've always been satisfied with the food.  Service can be a challenge on a busy night but we've never had to complain.  The risotto is great and the pizzas are excellent.  A great neighborhood restaurant!"}
{"text":"The menu is fantastic, the decor and layout is cute and a good conversation starter and the waitresses are nice and knowledgable. My hunger and taste buds are always satisfied when I dine here. I'm happy it's close to home."}
{"text":"Been in Richmond Hill for a lot of years and passed by this restaurants many times but never really attempt to walk in there.  Until one day, I decided to give it a shot and it has changed my mind.  The food is great and reasonably priced.  Sometimes I think they are better than the big chain restaurants at East Beaver Creek.  They don't have many waitress or music background like the big chains but it's cozy enough for families or a loving couples.  At the end, what do you want from a restaurant.  GREAT FOOD.   You've done it right."}
{"text":"This place is so adorably quaint. I've been here several times and the food isn't the best italian food you've had in your life, but it's real italian food and made in house and I've always been happy with it. I remember when they first opened they gave so much garlic bread per table and their garlic bread is amazing so it was awesome but then they reduced the amount. They'll still give you more if you ask, but who wants to be that person asking for their third refill of garlic bread right? Anyways forget the bread, because the pastas, pizzas, and risottos are all done very well so you'll have more than enough delicious carbs. The meat based entrees are definitely pricier and they are good, but I definitely wouldn't recommend only getting those options. I've never ordered wine here, but they do have a nice little collection. They usually have daily specials which are just as good as their normal dishes.

The waitresses are totally part of the experience here. They're super friendly, personal, and very helpful when deciding on what you want. I've only ever had female servers here which is probably intentional but they're all great at their jobs so it's working for them.

It's family friendly, but the space is small so children do need to be controlled. My meals here have usually been $25-$40. I like the seafood risotto, ravioli, and all the pizzas are great. My friends love the penne alla vodka, but I don't find it to be particularly special."}
{"text":"A quaint restaurant with a nice romantic mood. The price is reasonable for a gourmet Italian restaurant. The pizzas are made in a traditional stone/wood oven.

Their courteous staff are very helpful."}
{"text":"Went in for a couple of beers and decided to have dinner while I was there. Service was mediocre, but I have to admit that the waitress was alone and a bit busy. Asked for the third bottle when I ordered my food and also asked for the bill at the same time. My 2 empty bottles of beer were taken away when she brought the third. Decided to have the $19.00 \"Angus\" steak, cooked medium. 

Veggies were grilled nicely. Steak was more like a charred piece of leather with a lot of gristle. My jaw was sore after eating it. Complained to the waitress but nothing was done about it. Bill didn't come until well after she had taken my away my plate."}
{"text":"Came to Oregano for lunch with my girlfriends. The place was empty, so the food came out fast. The server was super friendly and nice.
Some dishes were great, like pizza and fish special. But things like fried calamari were way to oily and overfried, plus for $11 portion other places serve way more of those.  Mussels didn't test great either. That's why I'm taking one star out."}
{"text":"This is really a hidden gem in Richmond Hill. My girlfriend and I were craving pasta tonight, so we resorted to Yelp and found this place in the nearby. We ordered the Penne Al Vodka and the Baked Lasagna take-out.

When I got to the place, I was a little skeptical as there werent any customers. The place looked cozy and comfortable though! Got the food and brought it home. Had a taste and we were extremely impressed. This is a true definition of \"You can't judge a book by it's cover\". The food tasted fresh and homemade. I was so relieved that I didn't see a lot of steam when I opened the box, as that usually means the food was microwaved. 

I will say though, the online menu prices are outdated. The actual prices are a little more expensive (at least for the lasagna).

Can't wait to try this place again."}
{"text":"Inside decor and lighting was romantic, intimate and cozy, it was a true hidden gem. It reminded me of being in a restaurant downtown or Little Italy although the restaurant location was in a plaza in Richmond Hill. 

Good selection of pasta and pizza, it was hard to decide. We ended up ordering penne a la vodka and a garlic lover's pizza, which had sundried tomatoes, red peppers, wild mushrooms, goat cheese and of course garlic!  Finished with a caramel crunch cake for dessert :)

Our server was friendly and helpful, especially in guiding our pizza choice.

Would definitely go back and greatly enjoyed the experience."}
{"text":"I like this place, it Is romantic and cozy, they have limited seating. This was my first visit but the pizza was good, I always judge it from the crust and it said wood burning and it was delicious. Would go back definitely. The service was a little slow however, the wine was amazing. Can't wait to try the pasta dishes next time."}
{"text":"Everything is great, everytime I come here , and whatever I take it's always delicious ! The waitress is very nice ... For just a negative point : you have to wait a little bit longer than usual  to have your dishes. That's all of what's negative I could think about ."}
{"text":"This place has great thin crust pizza! Service is always great. I just wish the restaurant was a bit busier on the weekend."}
{"text":"Must Try: Smokey Salmon Pizza, Mussels in Marinara 

Rating: (8/10) Food, (7/10) Service, (7/10) Value, (8/10) Ambience, (8/10) Presentation, (9/10) Cleanliness

My Experience: 

Came late on a Sunday evening craving some authentic Italian pizza. The restaurant had a nice atmosphere with a stone oven in the back and a decent wine collection.

We had started with the Mussels in Marinara and had the Smokey Salmon Pizza, Cajun Chicken Pizza and Pizza Mediterranean. Overall the pizza's were good, considerably above average, however didn't really blow me away with the quality. 

The service was not bad, as the waitress was attentive, but the three pizza's took a very long time to come out, which was surprising as we were one of the few tables in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Pretty descent pizza place! We ordered the coconut shrimp and italian sausage pizza - both were delicious! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I almost feel bad for leaving two stars because the staff were very friendly, however the whole experience was a little underwhelming. And let me section it into groups to make this review easier to find what you're looking for.

Food:
My boyfriend and I got the penne al vodka and the pizza al cazone to share. 
The pasta (penne al vodka) honestly tasted like every other pasta i've had and made, it was quite plain and lacked flavour, colour, texture, etc. It didn't taste bad but i have no reason to want to come back for it. 
The pizza was more on the underwhelming side but maybe I'm not a pizza master so I shouldn't judge on quality. All i know is the crust was flat, the sauce was plain, the cheese concentrated a lot in the center leaving the outer half naked with sauce. I honestly don't know what was supposed to be on this pizza because it came out looking like your regular cheese pizza. 

Cost:
These meals are a little under $20, that's like pickle barrel money. Except the taste is far from pickle barrel. That's all I have to say.

Venue:
If I could redecorate, I would.

Experience:
Aight, so when we walked in first thing was the waitress seemed like she didn't know where to seat us, I've never been a waitress I don't know how restaurants work when it comes to seating so I won't judge too much. When we were seated we were given menus (and this is the part where waitresses get us started on drinks so we have something to sip on while we browse) but she just left. By the time we were ready to order, she came back but only asked for drinks. She gave us our waters and some garlic bread which was kind of her, but then walked away again. After we ordered, my boyfriend and I just talked but we sat at a table that was able to look into the kitchen. WE SAW WHEN OUR FOOD WAS READY AND WE JUST WATCHED IT GET COLD FROM A DISTANCE. When the food got to us it was luke warm. We were offered cheese and pepper for the pasta. The pepper was grinded, the cheese was in a mason jar for us to pour ourselves and so thats cool, bUT ANOTHER WAITRESS HAD TO COME LATER and she was like \"sorry im going to steal your cheese\". I'm not mad at her but i'm just?? why dont you guys just separate your cheese in small dishes or something. 

Feed back for the restaurant:
I've noticed that you guys have a lot of items on your menu and its good to have variety BUT you could really benefit from removing the quantity of dishes and focus on improving the quality of these dishes. It's better to have 3 great dishes that you've mastered well and that your customers are going to love coming back for rather than saying \"hey we have so many choices\" because looking at all of them i dont know where to start. Also seperate your cheese or handle the cheese like you handle the pepper."}
{"text":"Wood oven pizza very good. I made my own.  Real cheese, fresh ingredients. Good garlic bread to start. Staff very nice, music not too loud, tables a good size. I nearly fainted when my bill came to almost  $29. including tip for a personal sized pizza with 4 toppings. I only had water to drink. Pizza on the salty side."}
{"text":"I have had really great and not so great experiences with this restaurant, I feel like it depends on the day. The pizza is made in a wood burning oven (at least I think that's what it is) and every pizza I've tasted has been great. My favourite pasta is the penne alla vodka, but for some reason it hasn't been as good lately as it used to be. I also feel this way about most of the other menu items (excluding the pizza of course).
Overall, if you order pizza, you won't be disappointed. And hey, who doesn't like free garlic bread?"}
{"text":"They have the best grilled veggie chicken sandwich I've ever had. Very tasty. However I was pretty disappointed to learn that its only a lunch item and not offered throughout the day."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times. Great cozy place and great food. I haven't tried their Pizza & Pasta but the veal & mushroom on the menu is the best tasting meat I have ever tried. I always want to try their other stuff but I always end up ordering the veal because of how perfect and tasty it is. The servers have also been great every time."}
{"text":"I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice Italian restaurant that is reasonably priced and serves delicious food.The decor is nice and service is very welcoming. Sitting accommodation for small groups available. There is a wood burning oven inside the restaurant. They also have a decent dessert collection with cakes from La Rocca, they are a treat!"}
{"text":"Suuuper yummy italian place in Richmond Hill & they actually have tons of vegan/vegetarian options (everything is easily customizable) Anything with pizza calls my name. The inside of this cozy place definitely reminded me of a traditional italian restaurant, or even frankie tomattos because it was a bit over the top, but in a cute way.

I ordered pasta because I was very undercarbed and I had the penne puttanesca, which was delicious, although I did find it a bit oily and a tad bit salty. Still fully enjoyed it though. My friend had this pizza that looked so damn good. It was actually meatless and dairy free as well and you can definitely bet on the fact I took his leftovers with me (he was about to throw it away ...... what kind of blasphemy is this?!) 

Service was amazing and they were the sweetest girls ever that kept checking on if we needed anything. 

TLDR;
Pizza. Pasta. Deliciousness.
Vegetarian/vegan friendly.
Not expensive. 
Service is bomb."}
{"text":"I've gone to this place 2 and both times I was super satisfied. 

First time we dined in- I ordered the grilled calamari and the penne alla vodka my SO ordered their wood oven pizza and the grilled shrimp app. O.M.G everything was so rich and delicious.  The penne was cooked to perfection and perfectly sauced. The calamari was amazing except i'll get it next time with no peppers.

Second time- Ordered the same penne with extra sauce  it was good just like the first time. However, when we opened the pizza it was the wrong pizza. I called and told them the issue, they were super apologetic and offered to give me a discount on my next visit.I decided not to be lazy and do the 10 min drive back to pick up the right one, they made me a bigger one and told me to keep the other pizza. 

Pasta portions are huge so you'll definitely have leftovers for the next day."}
{"text":"Never eat there!!!!! the food is tasteless. all you taste is garlic and oil(not even a good oil).
the Cesar salad was gross!!!! croutons were stale and dressing tasted like from a jar.  i even found a hair on my stale garlic bread!!!!! the only redeaming factor was our waitress who was very sweet...."}
{"text":"Myself and my co-workers visit this restaurant regularly for lunch.  The food is amazing and all ingredients taste fresh and homemade.  The portion sizes on the lunch menu are fairly large. The service is friendly and fast.  When the restaurant gets busy, the service gets a little compromised.   I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Not a big fan, everything is mediocre.  Service is good. Nice cozy seats. But we came for food and everything is food court level."}
{"text":"We've been to this place several times and found the quality of the food to be consistently good.

The menu features a full range of Italian dishes, however, I don't think I have tried anything outside of the pizza section so this is the only one I am going to cover.

Individual pizzas look too big for one person to finish but they are not. The crust is so super-thin, you'll find your pizza to be just the right size to fill you up but not too big. 

The pies are made from their own dough and baked in a traditional wood-burning oven. I do think the oven is one of the reasons these pizzas taste so good.

Most entrees range from $11 to $19. 

One of the vegetarian choices that is worth trying is mediterranean pizza that features  feta, artichokes, and a variety of sweet grilled peppers as toppings and has *no* tomato sauce on it. Very unusual but is a healthy-er option and very tasty.

The place has a Yonge St address but you won't be able to see it from Yonge. It is inside the large plaza in between Loblaws and TD bank and not-so-easy to spot. 

There is a movie theatre in the back of the building. If that's your movies & dinner night, Oregano's may be just the right venue for the latter."}
{"text":"Ordered Penne Rigate. Was completely underwhelmed. 

Not at all spicy or garlicy. Sauce was way too oily.

Was really looking forward to a delicious pasta but was not satisfied at the end."}
{"text":"Service was excellent considering it was NYE and was a little busy. Good thing we had reservations! It is also kid/baby friendly. 

Tried the...

Coconut Shrimp - apparently made on site. It could have been crunchier but otherwise very nice ! 
Wild Mushroom Pizza - made on site with their stone oven and crust was thin (just to my liking). The ingredients were delicious together, though my hubby thought it could have been in there for another min or so. 
Italian Sausage and Hot Pepper Pizza - very tasty! I liked the spiciness of the peppers and I normally don't like sausage of any type but it blended well together. 

We can't wait to be back again!"}
{"text":"Secret gem in the city. We always gets the wood oven bake pizza and throughly enjoy them each time."}
{"text":"Went there while I was on vacation in the area, saw good reviews in here. 

When we arrived, the restaurant was empty, but shortly after we arrived, a group of 9 arrived.  There was only 1 waitress and one cook, so service was very slow because of that. 

Overall, the food was pretry good. We all had pizzas. I had the Red Roasted Peppers one, but I was deceived, since there were not a lot of peppers on my pizza. My pizza was also slightly uncooked and the taste of garlic was way too present. My husband had the Oregano mix pizza and it was good. My daughter had the Oregano basic pizza and it was also very good. 

There is no kids menu there, so you either have to share or order a regular item on the menu. Prices are good, around 13$-16$ per  meal."}
{"text":"This local pizza place has a wood burning oven and a great selection of pizzas. The ingredients they have are in the premium side of quality and the service is always expedient and friendly. The atmosphere is warm and cozy and usually is filled with a mix of people on dates and families.

The fresh garlic bread that they give you is a great start. It is garlicy and warm, careful not to fill up before your meal! It is super tempting.

Appetizers, both the breaded and grilled calamari is as you would expect which is good but not spectacular. Their Caesar Salad comes with fresh and crisp lettuce and is great to start with. I hate it when restaurants drench their salads in dressing and luckily they have never done this to me here.

For those who like veal, I've had the veal in peppercorn sauce, veal parmigiano, and the veal marsala. They are all tasty and filling with a stressor on filling. Make sure you're hungry or you're taking some home

The grilled salmon is my daughter's favourite dish. The fish is always cooked perfectly and the rice is a flavourful accompaniment. 

Their pizzas are just the way I like it, think crust, light on the sauce with plenty of imaginative toppings.  The Chiffonade and Bacon pizza is a great departure from the usual.  The spinach pairs well with the salty bacon fontina and provolone cheeses.  No tomato sauce on this one, so perfect for those who do not love sauce on their pizza all the time.  The Puttanesca Pizza is our second favourite that is a great explosion of vegetarian flavour."}
{"text":"Pizza margarita was amazing...the place has great ambiance and very reasonable price for what you get. I am definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Oregano Pizza just located on Yonge just north of Elgin Mills. It has a really small storefront and sometime it is really hard to notice that it is there.

They do serve lunch specials from $5.95 and the selections are great with 2 full pages and for sure you will find something that you like.

The portions are huge here... We should have just order the Veal Sandwich ($5.95) and a salad and split that.. but my friend want to try  Cajun Chicken Penne ($9.99) too.

The Penne is cooked Al dente and tossed in olive oil with tons of veggies. The chicken though is not plentiful and is little dry, maybe it is good that it is not plentiful :P.

The complimentary garlic bread would taste a lot better if lightly toasted and let the garlic butter melt.

The service here is nice and friendly. The deco is charming and does have a bistro feel.

They accepts all credit cards."}
{"text":"Dissapointed!! Bland food no flavour , seems rushed to make and probably pre-made/ frozen
Spaggetti was tastless, disliked the lemon chicken , eggplant parm was worse then the one i make at home  
Not a true authentic italian restaurant 
Will not be coming or ordering again"}
{"text":"Wanted to get a steak or veal sandwich and nope!  California Sandwiches was closed!  QQF! (equiv of WTF in french)
After flipping out the yelp app, we ended up at Oregano's.  Been in this mall a lot...they have the Ontario Service Centre here, but never ventured into the restaurant.
Sunday morning, 1PM...hungry with no place to go.  Sounds like we're having Italian!
We were the only ones there.  Not a busy time - the wood burning pizza oven was not even lit.  Nonetheless, I wanted a sandwich and nothing is going to stop me...well almost nothing.
The clan settled on a Veal Cutlet sandwich, a Chicken Parm with Penne, and a Steak Sandwich.  Told you I was going to get my sandwich!  Kind of good cause it was a great deal!
$8.95 for any sandwich with the soup of the day.  My steak sandwich was $8.95 already - so soup's on!..Them!  Yay!
The tomato soup with wild rice and mushroom was pretty good, the bread they gave us was toasted with garlic butter-ish stuff...not so good.
The chicken parm was bigger than the 5oz and the bed of penne was super large.  Oh...speaking of large...the sandwiches were humongous!  After the soup, it was hard to have all that food.  It was basically two meals as we took half of the servings home.
Not sure what it was but the sandwiches were missing something or maybe the buns were old (they were toasted and buttered).  It was not all that enjoyable.
Is it worth a second trip.  Yeah...next time, I think we will go when the place is hopping busy."}
