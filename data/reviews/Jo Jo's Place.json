{"text":"Jo Jo's Place is a good neighborhood diner for a good solid breakfast at a reasonable price with friendly staff.  Even though I was not a regular, I felt right at home in the comforts of Jo Jo's.  

The menu is typical diner fare.  I had a long day ahead of me so I decided to load up on with Chrissy's Carb Watch (eggs with cheese along side sausage and bacon), some coffee and a fruit cup on the side.  My breakfast filled me up.  

Service was not the fastest but it was friendly and my coffee cup was never empty.  The cost was more than reasonable.  I think my entire bill, even with the added fruit cup, was under $10.  It's a small place, too, so pay attention or you'll miss it."}
{"text":"Perfect stop for a filling truly homestyle breakfast. 
Thick French toast, then sliced home fries, fluffy pancakes and frequent coffee refills."}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch spots. The staff is very friendly and service is always fast. They have daily specials and daily soups. I have never been disappointed in the food, and the menu is fairly priced. The only bad thing I can say is that the restaurant itself is hard to spot; it's right on old Steubenville Pike, but the sign isn't very prominent."}
{"text":"Great ma pa breakfast joint. Fast, friendly service makes yinz  feel you're in grandmas dining room. Food is tasty and comes at you at a reasonable price. Love my locals."}
{"text":"A small mom and pop place with great prices, great food, and even better service.   I ordered the wake me omelet and it was excellent. I would return! Their home fries were excellent as well.  Can't wait to try the pancakes on my next visit ."}
{"text":"Had Jo Jo's famous Tuna noodle Casserole today.... Love it!

This place is run by a hard working women and her family.  It's open 6-2 and closed on Sundays.  The food is always good, service fast and priced reasonably.

This is one of my favorite breakfast & lunch places.

Favorite breakfast is: #2
Favorite lunch: Patty Melt ( with potato salad)

Many good specials.

{"text":"I don't really have anything bad to say about JoJo's. We were in and out in less than thirty minutes, even though they were moderately busy and understaffed (according to the waitress). In fact, there may have only been two waitresses on the floor, but they worked together and our coffee cups were always filled. 

I ordered a western omelet which was good, but a little on the small side. Or maybe I was just hungrier than usual."}
{"text":"Nothing special at all about this place. Mom & pop operation with very ordinary food."}
{"text":"Last Saturday I looked in the fridge and discovered that there was nothing there to make a nice breakfast. We didn't feel like going to our usual places so we tried something new. We are so glad that we did! 
Jo Jo's was a great choice! The place itself was very clean. The staff was very friendly and also very efficient.
The breakfast menu was very inclusive. We each ordered something different but tasted each other's too because it looked so good! The prices are very reasonable. And what is breakfast without coffee?? It was very good as well. 
I would recommend this place for sure and we will be returning often."}
