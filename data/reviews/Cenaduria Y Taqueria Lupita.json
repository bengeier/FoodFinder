{"text":"White people will be ignored until they leave. People that came in after us got their full order before we got our water which I'm not sure has arrived yet because we already left.  The quest for awesome tacos continues"}
{"text":"The food here is great. Not a single thing that I have tried that isn't delicious. Service is whatever but the food makes up for it. Very reasonably priced too for this bomb home made style food."}
{"text":"If your quest is the best menudo, made daily mind you, and with hoof as the traditional option, look no further. It is here at Lupita's.  There 
are places that come close but none quite as good.
Lupita knows tripas and the tacos are knockouts!
The service is friendly and a great place to try your Spanish as English is clearly the second language here. This place is about the authentic senoran food and they can care less about skin color or ethnicity.
Truly love this place."}
{"text":"Best shrimp tacos I have ever tried! Highly recommend. Got world class service by the servers and food came out in a timely manner. I will definitely come back with my family very soon!"}
