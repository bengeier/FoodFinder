{"text":"My girlfriends had always raved about Blvd, so I finally got them to take me one night.  It was a Saturday and we went here around 10 to start off our night.  The place was not what I expected.  You walk in and there it is, the whole place.  The dance floor is right in front of the main entrance, they had a couple tables there, they move them later in the night.  Most of the tables were reserved for bottle service, so we sat at the bar.  The ATM was out of order.  The bartenders were atypical scantily clad girls.  They weren't too friendly either.  After having a couple drinks we were able to snag a table.  The music wasn't what I was looking for, more trance.  We gave it an hour to see how things would shape up, they didn't.  So we ditched.

I don't think I would return to Blvd, unless all our friends were going there or something.  Its a place to check out though, it might be your cup'o gin!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night with one of my girlfriends - we went for the \"Club Experience\". 

Anyways.. I realize I live in Calgary.. but I'm sick of places/clubs in Calgary trying to pretend like they are from somewhere else. By this I mean.. I found this place to be a little \"try hard-ish\"... being in Calgary it's hard to determine what's the local nightlife culture like. 

BLVD definitely tries to cater to the \"high end\".. it almost seems like an imitation Vegas wanna be club. The inside is nice.. gorgeous bar.. has two rooms, though we only partied in the one in the front. The music sucked. I didn't get what their music theme is.. top 40? nope. some random crap? yes. 

door service? pathetic. if ur a male and want a boost to ur ego.. work as a doorman at a bar - u feel like u have unlimited power. I just don't get why u'd make 10 ppl stand in a line outside when there's enough room for em inside. 

i found bottle service over priced for this place (especially if ur going to charge a service fee.. and when your \"hostess\" never is at ur table to pour ur drinks) drinks at the bar were typical Calgary price. I've had better service at some of the other bars.. u'r paying for the experience and catering - not just the bottle.. this places service wasn't up to par at all. 

I guess it's nice to have the option to have a change of pace every now and then.. and to pretend like you're somewhere really posh. But I prefer the typical bars over this place. I'd rather save my glam and money for when im in vancouver/toronto or the USA. 

After reviewing the website (and my experience) I will definitely come back to see what the restaurant is like - I have high hopes that it'll be a much better experience"}
{"text":"I had a horrible experience here. 

I will not get into the details here but please men, if a girl from California does not want to talk to you, it does not mean she's from \"The Hills\". 
Fat tatted girls from Kelowna need to not come into Calgary and act like the garbage man left a piece of trash behind. 

Long story short, things didn't turn out pretty. I got kicked out and death threats from man I did not want to speak too. 

Calgary, PLEASE BRING MYNT LOUNGE BACK, this place is a pathetic excuse for a club."}
{"text":"I am not into clubbing as much as I used to, when I was say... 20. In fact, i need to be fairly inebriated these days to have a good time at a club.

So keep that in mind when reading this review....

Blvd was the venue chosen to host my girls 30th surprise birthday party. It has the size, great location, and atmosphere. After a complete birthday success, I can say the following:

- The staff were great. Professional, patient, and funny. We had a party of 25 or more, and they were very accommodating.

- Food - A+. 

- Drinks - A+

- Price - Not cheap, but you get that feeling as soon as you walk in.

After about 9 or so on a Saturday night, the place started to get packed, lineups, etc... but the place was still a blast - which probably had something to do with how much I had to drink.

I will definitely go back... as long as I'm drunk before I get there."}
{"text":"I pass BLVD everyday on 4th Street to get home, it is an enormous corner building, it looks stupendous from the outside, and it has dim lighting and literally has two flaming centerpieces outside.  It is a place you want to keep at the back of your memory for a special occasion.  I was so excited when a friend choose this place as her Bday bash of choice; I was going to yelp it all up.  

My conclusion is this...what a disappointing dining and dancing location.
Entering the lavish interior is absolutely divine; it's like walking down the red carpet, the flaming entrances the huge glass doorways.  Upon Entering the bar is set up as the center focal point and the tables cascade to the sides in rich textures, comfortable seating with throw pillows. The waitresses I found dressed tastefully but were a bit too standoffish and a little cold as servers.

I was extremely careful not to eat much during the day as I was expecting 5 star plates.  What Blvd offers is simply small plates to share; most of the substantial stuff is not on the menu anymore; the lamb, the beef... so you are basically filling yourself up with light meals and alcohol.
I had a hummus, with focacio and lamb, I expect the lamb to be skewered, instead it was ground and not much of a serving, tons of hummus and bread though but eating that for a main course is just silly.  My one friend had the chicken pizza and it wasn't anything to write home about, basically she said it was like they ordered out at Boston, it was sliced up and served on her plate.  Another friend had some taste temptations thing, you can check it out in my photos, basically 8 servings on wonton spoons, and we thought it was a joke so we called it the anorexic dish.  So basically my friend of course not in the least bit full ended up sharing mine.  Presentation was okay but the food was so so and definitely not up to par with all the decoration hype. 

Blvd menu could use some tweaking from the Hotel Arts Food group in the city to bring their menu items up to the standards it should be.

The DJ then came on and it was more lounge and trance, we were going to stay to dance but there just wasn't a groove happening.

My biggest disappointment was when the bill came, it automatically got tagged with a server fee, which I am assuming was the tip, I think around 12%.  I really cannot tolerate this ... charging your cliental a mandatory gratuity as if we were somewhere like New York or Toronto.  Get your menu updated so it is mouth watering, have things on it that are actually available and put a warmer smile on your service staff to deserve that gratuity.

Read the other reviews on this yelp list BLVD, you're looks just ain't enough I am afraid."}
