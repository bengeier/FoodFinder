{"text":"I visited with two others for lunch on a Saturday in August. The location was great since we were in Wendy Park. You can seat yourself inside or outside.

We ordered an Ultimate Bacon Burger, a Jalapeño Burger, and a Brisket Sandwich. Burgers can be ordered with pink or no pink in the center. Each order came with fries and pickles. We were all blown away by how delicious the sandwiches were. The bacon burger had crispy bacon with a hint of sweetness from a relish. The Jalapeño Burger had a nice kick, and the brisket was very flavorful. I only wished the fries were a little crispier.

Overall, it was a great experience and I will definitely return when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Total clownshow. Service was awful, food incredibly overpriced. Only redeeming qualities were the sunset and the $2.50 Miller Lite cans."}
{"text":"Use to Love this place. Its become obvious the new owners have no clue. First of all, youre here because of people enjoying sunsets. You dont serve Daquiris?? WTF i know ice machines would break you. 

Second of all. Its now a dog park with tables and drinks. Dogs all over pissing and shitting. Think im kidding? Come try for yourself and see. Cannot wait until someone gets bit. If you get bit, SUE THESE MOTHER FUCKERS UNTIL THEY ARE BROKE. 

Who ever is managing this place now. Have insurance because your ass is going to need it. 

Its a summer bar you idiots. NOT A FUCKING DOG PARK FOR DRUNKS... 

Idiots...idiots idiots. Bring back the old owners please.

P.S. Huge dogs just walking thru dining area begging for food. Its just a shame. 

BTW we are dog owners but we respect people that are trying to relax."}
{"text":"Enjoyed sunset, beautiful night ...
My wife sent video to son and our friends saying the place was out of 50s. Couple drunk guys 40s and old drunk dude 70 making fools of selves on dance area ...
Hitting on anything that walked....
Sat at picnic table, about half full ,outside...
Had a good time.... people had dogs, kids running around, couples ,wife, my adult daughter,  singles .... all ages...
I'd go back, good prices on beer.. fun"}
{"text":"Amazing view and that's all. 

My friend once ordered a salad here. The menu indicated it would have cheese. It arrived without cheese. She sent it back and they brought it back out with a Kraft American Single ripped apart and laid on the top. I wish I was joking.

Great place to grab a Miller Lite and enjoy the view after playing volleyball at Whiskey Island. If you're looking for good food or drink, avoid like it's the plague."}
{"text":"The only thing this place has going for them is the view of Lake Erie. Which at sunset is almost enough to fool you into thinking this place has potential. 

I begrudgingly have to say that I have been here more than once but commonly at the request of another group member. 

The food is subpar and they are commonly out of 3 or more entrees from their already small menu.

The service outside is slow as molasses and you can count on them messing up an order, your check or just forgetting about you all together. 

If you are looking for a overpriced beer with a nice view of the lake by all means give it a try but do not expect much beyond that."}
{"text":"Amazing location but horrible service. I have been here several times because of volleyball and every time its been bad service. If you sit at the tables outside just go to the bar to get your drink because it will be faster. The food is over salted but dont tell managment because they dont care.

Also, be aware of thier specials its cheaper to buy a beer verse a bucket. 

Sad to see such a great location with bad service and managment."}
{"text":"We went after work during the week; it wasn't overly crowded and the atmosphere was nice. The mixed drinks were good and the food was actually filling/good too. I have only had the chicken Cesar wrap from there, so I can't say how the other food tastes, but I was satisfied. It was a huge wrap w/chips for $8.95 (I think), so the price was fair for the quality & taste. This is not 5 star dining, but to get a feeling like I'm somewhere beachy, it's satisfying. The scenery is definitely the best thing about this place. Only con would be that on my last visit the server got our bills mixed up with the couple next to us. I'll be back tonight, so I'll change my review if anything changes with my experience :)"}
{"text":"We went to a Halloween party there last night. The mixed drinks that I had were good and it was called a Salted Carmel pumpkin spice.  The Free appetizers were good and included:  Chicken fingers, potato skins, shredded pork sliders, salad and chicken rolled in pasta shaped like a burrito.  The Bartenders were okay."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go in the summer. They always have good bands and great sunset views over the lake!"}
{"text":"We had horrible service here. Had to call of a waiter after 20 minutes just to order drinks. A different guy came for our food order, and we ordered a burger and a BLT, it took over 45 minutes to get our food. We asked if we could just pay for our drinks and leave and they brought our food about 10 minutes later. Then they tried to charge us for soda we ordered but never got. To top it all off, we sat next to a family with 3 dogs barking and sitting on top of the table that people eat on. They were not tiny dogs either. I was disappointed to say the least, they pump this place up so much on the radio. It was very unorganized and not service friendly."}
{"text":"Left Edgewater Beach to catch a drink still by the water before heading back to the Eastside.  Service was very slow, and drinks were pretty pricey.  $8.50 for a tall 16oz summer shandy is unacceptable.  

Food was pricey too, $7 for a wrap, no fries, but you can add fries for $4 more, for how chill and average looking the place is, you would think they would have average prices.  All this is, is bar food, nothing special.

Was just ok, probably would not go again."}
{"text":"Good place to eat and drink with a great view. Service can sometimes be slow when they are packed."}
{"text":"I play volleyball weekly and came here when it was sunset....not sure if mgmt changed but service is now terrible.  We wait and it's not even busy.  We have to find the waitress or order from the bar."}
{"text":"We went here Friday of Labor Day Weekend during the day and sat outside on the patio. Very spacious, with many tables, good oldies music playing, a great view of Lake Erie, the aroma of burgers grilling, and DOG FRIENDLY! 
We took our dog and the waitress brought her a tub of fresh, cold water without us asking, which we thought was a bonus! We had burgers and fries, very fresh, tasty ingredients at a very fair price. The staff we encountered were fabulous. I'm glad we live close, because we will definitely be back! If you go here, you must walk down to the pier and check out the view of the city, one of my favorite places to go!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch and drinks on Saturday late afternoon, sat at table outside. It was very crowded and a band was playing. It was quite noisy and difficult to have conversations at the table, but the band was decent. The view was spectacular, worth the trip. Did not order food as the menu was somewhat limited and a little pricey for what was offered. Service was fantastic by Robin, she was attentive, pleasant, and we never waited for anything even though she was taking care of soooo many tables! Because of the view and great service we will go back!"}
{"text":"Food was overpriced cafeteria food. Service was terrible. Fireball was over 5$ a shot. STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"Sitting by the lake with good drink and food. We come here to hear the bands and always packed. Amazed at how quickly the place fills up. The food is great but when the place is packed the kitchen is slow but that is to be expected. Wings are meaty and great sauces. Food runners bring out your meals but the staff was quick to check up on. A nice summer hidden gem."}
{"text":"Very fun atmosphere, and fast service! The bartender Amanda is great. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about the service. Our server, Rose, was a sweetheart. Efficient, friendly and attentive. There were several other people who ran food or helped with other things and they were all great as well.  The band playing was a lot of fun and really involved the crowd- some of the employees were having with it too. It was a really casual, fun atmosphere and we enjoyed ourselves. There was plenty of seating, the restrooms were clean and everything was stocked appropriately. 

Our food was mediocre. A little pricey for what we received. I don't think any of us finished our meal because it was just lackluster. I do wish I had tried a pineapple drink or another cocktail I watched go by. They looked delicious and everyone said the drinks were wonderful. I missed out. :-(

If there was a band playing there I wanted to see, I would definitely go back. I might just eat ahead of time and get drinks/ appetizer instead."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink about 9pm on Sunday July 18, 2015. Outdoor bartender told us that they were closed outside and to go inside if we wanted anything. We proceeded inside to find about 6-7 people sitting at the bar. None of the tables were occupied. We walked to one end of the bar that was empty and waited. The bartender looked at us & (exact words) said \"I'm the only one. It's going to be a while.\" Should have just left then. We decided to wait for another 5-7 minutes. Watched the bartender joke around & make shots for other people. After we watched him be completely rude to another customer who walked in, we decided to leave. So glad we did. This place is so horrible and the staff has always been extremely rude. Never had a good experience at this place, no matter what the name of it is. It's too bad because we would come here more often if the employees were not so condescending and impolite."}
