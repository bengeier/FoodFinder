{"text":"In lieu of all the bad reviews, you should give this place a shot. I believe that you have to give restaurants the benefit of the doubt when they are brand new. There will be longer wait times and food prep will most def have some issues. That being said...we came today at 5pm in order to avoid rush dinner times. And it paid off! We only waited 15 min for our food. Got an order of small wings and did half and half....the spicy wings were pretty spicy in my opinion but the soy garlic were quite tasty. The wings were crispy and plump. Also ordered the Bulgogi sliders and they too had a lot of flavor, the slaw on top tasted similar to the spicy mayo they put on sushi. I did try to get a piece of the burger without the slaw and it had flavor on its own (think I'll try with the slaw on the side next time) The service was quick and easy checkout unlike so many of these negative reviews. So please give them a try.....I don't think they should be judged so harshly just starting out. Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Wow.  In a bad way. Worst meal we've had out in a long, long time.   It took thirty minutes for our order of wings, fries and a salad to come out. When it did, the fries and wings were so overcooked and dry it was like eating fried dough. We left over half our meal there and left.   Won't ever go back."}
{"text":"Read this before you go: Hint #1:This is meant to be a family-style restaurant, meaning that you get little plates and everyone takes some of each entree on their little plate. Hint #2: This is a Korean restaurant, meaning the food is Korean spicy. If you don't like spicy, do not get the tteokkboki or the spicy chicken. If things are really spicy for you, you can cool off your mouth with rice, pickled radish or iced tea. Hint #3: If you get the bibimbap, PLEASE, mix it all together and add gochujang sauce to your desired spicy level. You can always add more sauce on your own plate.  We had a great experience - we were seated quickly, we got our food fairly quickly, everything was hot (temp wise) and our drinks were refilled before we asked. We did go after 3 on a Sunday, though. And the food, the food was SO GOOD!   The only downside was that the food did not come out all at once but if you share it family style, you just start with what comes out first.  I wish BonChon luck because we would like to be regulars."}
{"text":"Terrible service. The server poured refills on everyone's lap (party of 4). Very little knowledge of menu, but it is a new place. That being said, the signature chicken combo was super crispy and the sauces were perfect! Other dishes not as good."}
{"text":"All the hype is justified. This chicken is legit. I like to get the half and half but only because the spicy is so spicy that I have to balance it out. Don't waste your time on fries or onion rings. Less than average. Kim chi cole slaw is really good. Kim chi is pretty good. But go here for the chicken."}
{"text":"The best Korean fried chicken you'll ever find in NC! All the food I've ever order came out yummy and fresh. If you're okay with spicy food then I would recommend getting the chicken half and half. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Outstanding.  Their version of spicy is pretty solid.  Be warned.  Also, I know it's a novelty, but get rid of the radishes. They are a nice novelty, until you realize they make the restaurant and my fridge stink."}
{"text":"Came here on the 2nd day. Wings were great- our order was mixed up so we got some drums instead of wings. We mentioned it to our server and they fixed it for us. The drums were drier than the wings, I recommend doing the wings- much juicier. Both flavors are worth trying but the spicy on day 2 was very hot and the sauce was thin and didn't have a hint of sweetness. It was missing something or had too much of something, didn't seem like it was 100% together....The soy garlic was perfect. We had the Japchae (glass noodles with marinated beef and crunchy veggies) and it came out piping hot and was great. Just how Mom used to make it. Radish was not on the plate when the wings came out. Rice was a little dry.   Our service was slow but that doesn't necessarily mean it was our server, we were told the kitchen was a bit overwhelmed and they had us wait 10 minutes before they sat us even though the restaurant had available seating- which is totally OK! I rather them do that than seat everyone and have even longer ticket times. It's better for everyone that way, at first.   So, since this place is brand new, be prepared to wait to get seated and for the process to be slow, but the food is worth it. Expect it to be a longer wait during peak hours on weekends. Front door is super nice and our server was too. NO TAKE OUT AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW.  I would give the whole experience a 3.5 but the food was a solid 4, which I consider very impressive on a soft opening. Can't wait to come back. This is going to be the best place in Charlotte for Korean fried chicken and traditional Korean food! So much better than that \"Korean\" restaurant in South End.  *I would like to point out that the tip suggestions at the bottom of the receipt is incorrect. The percentages should be based on the grand total, we would have under tipped if it wasn't for us doing the math ourselves instead of trusting the suggestion.*"}
{"text":"The service was pleasant and the food was super flavorful! Try the Japchan and Bulgogi Tacos...DEF winners!!"}
{"text":"Arrived at 12:05 today very excited to try this place. However, we were informed at the door that the wait was 40 minutes even though no one was in line, and there were several empty tables (??). We left. Might try again in a couple of weeks to see if they have the opening kinks worked out."}
{"text":"Terrible experience.   Ordered carry out.  I was told it would be 15 -20 minutes.   After 30 minutes I asked about my food.   They would not tell me where my food was or what happened or when it would be ready.  There are way too many amazing restaurants in Charlotte to ever waste my time going there ever again.  8:30. No dinner for my family.   Sad and pathetic grand opening.   Do yourself a favor and avoid"}
{"text":"What a fun place! We went sort of on a lark, Saturday night, no plans, had seen the sign passing on Woodlawn. Didn't know exactly what to expect, fine dining/casual fast food/whatever. A neighbor went along to check it out. Well it went from an unknown to a new favorite in one visit. Saturday night 7 PM, the place was busy. Real busy as in 20 minute wait, not that ridiculous 2 hours you get some places. The fried chicken is just outstanding, juicy, just different enough, but very unique. There are a lot of great looking things on the menu but I wonder if I'll ever get over there as the fried chicken is a go for thing! It's that good. Careful as the portions are massive. We ate at the bar. There is a full service bar, four big screen tv's and a French bartender that is a charmer. Once you figure out the size of the portions. (We have a couple of boxes in the refrigerator this AM) this place is a pretty good deal. Our check was $90 with some wine, but we easily could have fed our two teenage boys with what we boxed. So that's less than $20  a person with wine. Pretty hard to beat. Atmosphere is lively, family friendly.  Service seemed to be fast enough. I didn't notice all the delays the others have talked about. I guess they got their act together. All around a place you can put on your list of regulars. Don't miss this place."}
{"text":"Salmon avocado balls are bigger, wings are better, service was tremendously better. We had the same waitress and she has greatly improved and was very attentive. Keep it up Bonchon."}
{"text":"Finally! We've been waiting for Bon Chon to come to Charlotte and are thrilled that it's here. The chicken is ridiculously and dangerously good.    They are still ironing out the kinks with service and seating, but the food is spot on.   In addition to the chicken (have I mentioned that it's beyond delish?), we got the bibimbap and tacos. Both were good, but I really just wanted more chicken.  Can't wait for them to start takeout service"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time for lunch. There was a good crowd and servers seemed busy. Food came out in a reasonable time for lunch which is always a plus when trying a new place. I ordered the glass noodles. Flavor and portion was excellent. Could have used a little more spice, but not sure if the dish is supposed to be spicy so I won't knock them for that. Ambiance did not make feel like I was at a Korean restaurant and they still don't have a liquor license. For something different and reasonably priced this place is excellent, but don't expect a wide variety of different Korean dinners that is not what they are going for. Definitely worth trying and wishing them success in breaking the curse of this location. I will be back periodically."}
{"text":"Great spot for fried chicken. Just as good as the locations in New York. Love that they added more to the menu.  The sliders were great and the chicken was as good as I remember."}
{"text":"Their wings are incredible!! So is pretty much all of their other food for the most part! The noodles, the bulgogi, and the Korean tacos were AMAZING! The fried rice was okay. It's not the greatest place to take your children, no kids menu and they wouldn't even give us just a small side order of noodles. We ended ordering our 7 year old the big order of noodles and she hated it ... although we thought it was amazing!  The atmosphere is different and cool, I really like how they have the walls all decked out! We love it and would totally go back, preferably when we don't have our daughter with us:)"}
{"text":"My wife and I made a last minute decision to try out Chonbon for dinner. We arrived about 6 pm on Sunday. Although it was not full we were pleasantly surprised to see Korean customers at the restaurant. This was a good sign for a chain Korean restaurant.   Both my wife and I had one of our favorites: Bibimbap. Actually in other places this would be called \"Dol sot bibimbap\" since it was served on a hot stone bowl. My wife had bibimbap with seafood. I had bibimbap with tofu. Both were very tasty. My wife's had plenty of seafood: squid and shrimp. The red sauce was delicious and spicy. We both loved the heat on our tongues!!  The stone bowl was piping hot and made the rice nice and crispy. I tried to save half of the dish for leftovers. But after I got home it kept calling me from the refrigerator. After an hour I lost my will power and inhaled the rest of it.   Can't wait to go back and for the Pineville store to open soon."}
{"text":"I came on a Saturday around 4:30PM. Probably the best time go because it wasn't as busy so the server was very attentive and nice. It seemed to get busy around 6PM. The wings are amazing. The spicy wing is definitely spicy but super delicious.  We also got the bulgogi taco. I definitely recommended it! It isn't too salty as well."}
{"text":"Probably the worst dining experience I had in years. I've been to Bonchon in NYC and it was nothing like this.   My boyfriend waited nearly 20 minutes for his beer and they brought him the wrong one. The food came out plate by plate for five people after a hour and a half. I ordered the Bibimbap + Edamame. The bibimbap had zero flavor whatsoever. It came with a side of hot sauce which I can't eat. It was terrible. The edamame was hot but over-salted.  Service was abysmal. Don't waste your money. You would be better off to go to the chick-fil-a near by. Will never go back."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Did not live up to hype. Food came out cold, and took forever. Staff not welcoming, positive, or knowledgeable. Saw several tables call over the \"manager\" to complain. Interior decor is lack luster. Will be surprised if it makes it."}
{"text":"I moved down from DC in the beginning of September and one sad point about that is that there are a few Bonchon's in the DC/Arlington area that are incredible. There's no possible way there would be such good Korean Friend Chicken or even a Bonchon in Charlotte right? WRONG.  I don't remember exactly when I looked up if there was a Bonchon in Charlotte but I remember texting my girlfriend immediately and being SUPER happy.  I got it for the first time finally on the way back from a 7 hour road trip (From DC, actually) so I just knew I needed it. I live in Noda so I essentially drove us past our house by 20 minutes and then back. Definitely worth it.  I got my usual strips half and half and potstickers half and half. There are mostly similarities between DC and Charlotte Bonchon, but there are some noticeable differences.   First, the potstickers in Charlotte have both pork AND vegetables - which I prefer. That wasn't even an option in DC, only pork potstickers there. Second, I noticed that the chicken is noticeably thinner in Charlotte for the strips. The Arlington and DC locations were much thicker. You still got the signature Bonchon crunch, so I can't complain too much.  Also, for the first time I tried their beef fried rice. Nothing too innovative or crazy, but it was pretty tasty!  I've yet to try any other KFC while in the area, but Bonchon will always be a solid go to when I need it."}
{"text":"Honestly, I was a little worried about the 3.5 stars rating but Yelp is not always accurate (learned from past mistakes).  I will visit this place again, specifically for the fried chicken. They forgot about my bibimpop so I was a little disappointed (that's why 1 star is missing).  Fried chicken - 5 STARS!!!!  hands down so good! Will definitely order it again. $8.95 for 8 wings + 1 side (lunch special)  Bulgogi - 4 stars You can taste that I was actually grilled, which brings out the flavors a lot.  Way too expensive for the portion $15.95 so I'll probably won't order it again.   Tteokbokki -  It wasn't bad but it wasn't extremely tasty either.  $10.95 pretty average price. I will order it again.  Sodas are $2. Of course, totally overpriced."}
{"text":"Wings are amazing! So crispy and tasty! The sauce was the perfect amount, not drenched but still covered. The spicy is very spicy and flavorful. And the soy garlic is also flavored very well and balanced. I always get my wings half and half. The kimchi coleslaw is also a must to try!   I find the other menu items to be mediocre, however, I have only tried a few things. Wings are definitely the highlight."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today.   It's tucked away in a little shopping center. You can see the sign from the road though.   Not too busy for. 2:30-3:00 o'clock lunch time. We were the only table our whole meal.   The service could be better.   The bibimbap was a bit more soggy than others that I've had. The rice didn't crisp up as much.   The chicken wings are good. Not extremely great but yes, different because they're Korean fried wings. The skin is crispy and fluffy and the meat is juicy.   The salmon bowl was great! Should get that it won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Overhyped. The chicken was good, but not worth it.  I got the 10 chicken strips, 1/2 spicy 1/2 soy garlic & a water. $15. Personally that's not worth it. Chick fil a is right next door and I should've gone there instead.   And let me warn you, the spicy is spicy. And it doesn't help when the waitress does not refill your drink regularly. The soy garlic was really good though.   Also, we didn't get the full menu. We got something like a lunch menu. Later I saw folks with more choices, but it was too late our food already arrived.   The chicken was tasty, overpriced & service was poor. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"When I tell y'all the food here is amazingggg ITS SO GOOOOOOODDDDD  ALSO THE MUSIC IS AMAZING loVe iT sO mUcH thanks for a great meal with great music,, 10/10 would recommend"}
{"text":"\"It is against our policy to give extra sauce.\" - The Management  Honestly, the wings were pretty good and crispy, and our server was friendly -- but the reason I'm leaving a one-star review is because of a ridiculous company policy.  When my spicy wings arrived, they were a little light on sauce.  I asked for extra sauce, and the waitress brought me a bottle of sriracha.  \"I don't want sriracha,\" I said.  \"I want more of the sauce that came on the wings.\"  The waitress explained that I can't have any more of that sauce.  Seriously.  \"It's a secret sauce,\" she explained.  When I asked what that had to do with me not getting enough sauce on my wings, she took me back to the kitchen and asked a cook in front of me if I could have more sauce.  \"No,\" he said. \"Company policy.\"  When I offered to pay, he rudely ignored me and walked away from the window.  The waitress rolled her eyes and apologized to me.  She obviously thought it was a stupid policy herself, but she said there was nothing she could do about it.  By that time, my wings were cold; but I didn't bother complaining, because I figured it was company policy to not reheat them either."}
{"text":"So my first trip here the food was excellent but the service was lacking. We have since come back on three more occasions and are happy to report that the food is still excellent and the service has improved dramatically. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I have lived in Korea for 4 years and I love Korean Food, this is a fusion place but the flavors are traditional.  The food comes out fresh and hot.  When the menu says spicy it actually is, so if you don't like spicy try something else.  I had the shrimp dumplings and they were so good.  We also tried the spicy chicken tacos, bulgogi, chicken fried rice, and the spicy chicken wings.  All the food was superb. The chicken is so crispy and juicy.  I would recommend this place, the only down side is food comes out as it is ready so not at the same time. I never mind that but some do."}
{"text":"Despite all the mixed reviews, we had to try out Bonchon. We actually had really good service and food on Saturday for an early lunch. Server was knowledgeable and friendly. Wings were great. A little spicy for me, but I'm sort of a wimp. Bibimbop was pretty tasty. The katsu was a letdown, would not order again. Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"This was our first time here - the server did not understand english so she was not much help with the menu   Chicken was crispy and cooked well;  spicy chicken had good flavor, not very spicy but it tasted good.  The soy garlic chicken was kind of bland.    Octopus pot sticker were mushy flavor was ok.    Chicken fried rice was fresh - the flavor was just ok   The chicken wrap was our favorite - good flavor and fresh ingredients and had a nice spicy sauce."}
{"text":"Service us consistently TERRIBLE. Can't stand going here anymore simply because of that.  Seoul in southend has better wings, great service and an excellent atmosphere. no reason to do bon chon ever again."}
{"text":"First time trying Korean fried chicken, and now, I'm a huge fan! We came not long after they first opened and received prompt and friendly service. Cost is a little on the upper end for fried chicken, but it was honestly worth every penny. Chicken was super crispy and boldly spicy."}
{"text":"Their wings are so good!!! The only thing I don't like is that you can only order two flavors, and the spicy one is so spicy that it's basically inedible. It would be great if you were able to order this flavor but kicked down just one or two notches. The wing texture really is awesome, though. I also love the bonchon wrap. Delish."}
{"text":"Disappointed in the execution of one of my favorite foods. Service was really too  slow (took almost an hour to get my order during lunch) and the food was only OK. I'm hoping that they'll work out their service kinks and speed up to deliver freshly cooked because Charlotte needs bon chon to stay!"}
{"text":"I first had Bonchon in DC, then it came to NJ. I always LOVE the spicy wings. And they are HOT! I love it."}
{"text":"Finally got to try them out in Charlotte since they opened and they are now doing takeout service as well. The service still is slow most likely due to the staff and business being new so give it a chance since the food is on point.  I got an order of their Wings + Drums combo (Half Soy Garlic, Half Spicy). The Spicy is where it's at and brings the heat. The Soy Garlic was lacking in the flavor dept but I'll give it another chance. The chicken was super crispy goodness while not being really greasy.  * One thing to note is they handed me a regular menu which just shows chicken but they have a takeout menu that has a wide array of other dishes of appetizers and entrees."}
{"text":"I had hoped to be logging in to say I love this place.  But I can't say because I can't seem to access their food to try it.    I called and it goes to a blank mailbox saying the voice mail is full (is the number correct on the website?).  So my husband drives over to place an order and wait while enjoying a beer.  But as he walks in, he is told they don't do any takeout.  How is this possible?  Not just for any restaurant but an establishment that is not a fine dining environment....which would still likely do takeout if asked!  They are new so maybe that is why?  We are baffled.  And he is now at Co across the street giving them the business that BonChon just gave up."}
{"text":"Visited on 6/17. Very quiet on a Sunday night at 7:45pm. Excellent wings - awesome crunch and great spice. Dumplings are also tasty - nice and crispy exterior. I'm curious to try their other offerings, I saw another table ordered all Udon.   Casual atmosphere and family friendly. Felt a little pricey after it was all said and done, so it'll be more of an occasional visit verses a go-to."}
{"text":"Fried chicken is a huge thing in South Korea right now. Fried chicken joints flood the streets of Seoul more than fast food joints and greasy spoons do in this area. And Bonchon is my favorite of all of them.  Whether in Korea, California, New York, or here, Bonchon Chicken has never disappointed me yet.  The chicken is double fried to have a perfectly crispy shell wrapped around tender juicy chicken meat, and their glazes are the tastiest of the Korean fried chicken chains.  Go ahead and order anything on the menu, just be aware that those other choices might not be as tasty because their specialty is the sauce. Yea, the sauce. Anybody can fry up some chicken, but the sauce makes it unique. So if you are new to Bonchon or Korean fried chicken culture in general, anything with the glaze are what you want to try first."}
{"text":"This is my second visit and I already know that the food is impressive. The host was a not very inviting but didn't let her put a damper onEven though what I had during my first was good I was almost tempted to have the Korean Wings again. I made the choice of a the Japchae this time. It was so tasty. Love the glassy noodles and the the korean tacos were amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Great crispy Chicken! I really enjoyed the spicy flavor and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"I just went to try out this new Korean fried chicken place OMG let me tell you how amazing I was. Even thou there is only two flavors, soy garlic and spicy soy garlic, the wings are so crispy and tasty. I don't know what they do to make it so crispy but yeah not oily. It has a delicate crunch on it when you bite into the wings, it's not your the typical wings place you will find. But be aware that when they said spicy they mean spicy. I also order and avocado salmon ball it was very good as well, grilled salmon wrap around the avocado, crabmeat, and cucumber, and top it off with spicy mayo and ell sauce I believe it was so good. Talking about it making me want to make another visit for another try. They still don't have their alcohol there yeah, but hopefully they will get it soon. Cause that's going to be my new hangout place for the football season"}
{"text":"My sister and I have been waiting for this location to open up since Bonchon in NoVa got us hooked on KFC.  We've been to this location twice for dinner and I'm a little disappointed in the food. I expected service to be abysmal considering we went on the first day they opened and once more during their first week so the stars are based solely on the food.  So far, we've had the seasoned fries, takoyaki, chicken katsu, and the soy garlic wings.  The seasoned fries were a fail. While they had a nice flavor, they were too hard from being fried for too long. It was also absurdly expensive at $7. I'd rather buy a bag of frozen fries at a grocery store and fry them up myself.   The takoyaki was decent. I prefer takoyaki to be a bit more crisp on the outside than how Bonchon makes them and the bonito flakes were lacking but the flavor satisfied our craving.  The chicken katsu could be better. The portion was generous but just like the fries, the cutlet was fried for too long and it was incredibly hard to eat. It's also fairly pricey and there are other restaurants in the Charlotte area where you can get better and cheaper katsu.  As for the chicken wings. we were devastatingly disappointed. You could tell they were trying to skimp on portions because we had pieces that were as long as our thumb. I remember other Bonchon locations had wings that were comparable to this location's drumsticks. The coating is also disappointing. One of the most memorable things about Bonchon in NoVa was how crisp and thin the chicken coating was. Our chicken actually stayed crispy 9 hours later when we ate the leftovers for breakfast and we were hoping this location could replicate that experience. However, the chicken coating here is much thicker, similar to Chinese double fried chicken. While the chicken can stay crisp for a few hours, it's difficult to eat because it hardens rather than retaining the same texture.   Overall, I think we're hesitant about visiting this location again because the quality of the food here does not justify the high prices. It's worth driving to NoVa to satisfy that KFC itch."}
{"text":"100% the best wings in Charlotte. I've had many and the spicy wings were incredible. Low key atmosphere and friendly wait staff. I went on a Saturday around lunch time. I can't emphasize how delicious this food was. If I had more stars I'd give them to this place."}
{"text":"First time here. I had the lunch special; 3 hot and 3 soy/ginger piece chicken with rice. There was very little customers and the food took a little while to get to us. The hot chicken was good and the soy/garlic was ok. The rice was ok (did not taste fresh). Our service was ok. My friend had the chicken strips special with fries. The fries were good! He reported the chicken strips as being dry. The price was a little high. Overall I was not impressed. I noticed a number of other Korean dishes on the menus other than Bon Chon but I have no desire to try them. I marginally recommend this Resturant. Maybe someone could convince me to try it again."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely amazing! The atmosphere is really laid back. The food took a long time to come but it was well worth the wait! Our chicken wings were cold but they ended up taking them off our receipt. Service was great! The managers were on the floor and you can tell they care about the restaurant. The $5 margaritas and $5 martinis were A Perfect Touch! We would definitely be back again. They had the best chicken wings ever! If you're in town this is where u need to come for chicken wings."}
{"text":"I guessing they're freshly open. They need to really work their kinks out and work it out soon.  Still no liquor license.. Food takes way over 20mins to arrive after ordering even after the lunch hour rush. Customer service is ok.. The personal touch just isn't there. Take out orders are still questionable.  However, their foods are good. I have the soy garlic wings. In love with the crispy crust with the sweet coated sauce. And they still manage to keep it very juicy.. Their house fried rice is addicting too. I'm excited to visit them again soon. Just hoping they will work out their kinks!"}
{"text":"This is an answered prayer! Like for real! I'm so excited! My kids (8 & 6) LOVE BonChon! We are all excited. And yes we are addicted."}
{"text":"Completely unsatisfactory service right at the door. Apparently you can not walk in and ask for take out. Well, 1st the hostess said I could but there was a 45 minute wait for take out. Then when I was ready to order. She said I can't have take out. We'd have to be seated 1st. WTF!!!??? And then take the food to-go. The wings were decent. Our waitress was nice. The hostesses should not be making up stupid rules as they go."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken wings, half soy and half spicy.  The wings were greasy and not fresh at all! This was my first time at this location.  I normally eat at the Bonchon in Ballantyne where their wings are ALWAYS hot and fresh and never greasy.  I will not return back to the Woodlawn location."}
{"text":"So this place had good food and drinks are reasonably priced. Only thing about this place lacks is good service. Kinda need the servers to be more aware of their customers and not forget their food. This is my fourth time here and my food is always forgotten."}
{"text":"Attempted to eat there last night and they told me it was a 30 minute wait when I saw at least 5 open tables available. Tried to get take out after that and they said they \"didn't offer\" takeout. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Good wings with a unique seasoning to them, octopus was fresh and tasty, fried rice had a great smokiness to it and the Kimchi was super delish with the right amount of heat. Flavor-wise this establishment got everything right. Staff was friendly and was willing to discuss menu items and always kept our glasses full. I'll definitely bring my family back."}
{"text":"The chicken is outstanding. Some of the best I've had in town (save the chicken at the gas station at the corner of South and East, but that's another post). Fries are crispy and flavorful, and the pickled radish is fantastic. I had a half and half wing/leg lunch combo and can't wait to go for dinner to try more of their selection.... in a few months  The 3 star review is more regarding the inefficient and unpolished service. I understand they're in a soft opening period, but mere basics of service etiquette are ignored. No explanation of upcharges (spicy mayo = $0.95, and this isn't listed on the lunch menu); having to ask for water refills and having your server point to your water cup rather than ask politely because she doesn't want to reach a few inches to pick it up; simple lunch plates coming out one at a time rather than being fired and prepared so the whole party is served at once; having to order a $1.95 side of what should have been complimentary pickled radish and wait for your server to put the order in, the receiving it halfway through the meal.   Bonchon is a cult chain for a reason. The food is outstanding and reasonably priced, but be aware they are in the middle of growing pains, and management is either new to the industry or spread too thin to see these problems. I will be back once these issues are ironed out"}
{"text":"It's okay. Usually Korean food seems more flavorful and fresh, compared to the other local hole in the wall Korean place in charlotte - this is just another chain restaurant.   Some of the food were unusually bland, though okay in flavor, fails to live up in hype."}
{"text":"Meh. The psych was high but the Charlotte Bonchon let me down. The food quality was inconsistent and priced much too high for what we got. The service had kinks that needed to be addressed. I'll try them again but it'll be a while."}
{"text":"Great place for a chicken craving! I live out of town from charlotte but I always come back to this place for the tender, crunchy, and crispy flavorful chicken! They have two flavors: Soy Garlic and Spicy. On the regular menu they give you a complimentary side dish of pickled radishes which will help cut the grease from the chicken and refresh your palette. Customer service are nice and friendly and I would 10/10 come back again for KFC."}
{"text":"Bonchon's fried chicken was a great discovery when I was living up in DC so I was really excited finding one in Charlotte! Walking in it kinda looks like a dive bar compared to the one near my old place in DC.  While sadly it does not measure up to the one I was introduced to the chicken is still quite good. There were some hiccups when they had first opened that made for some subpar chicken but that has since been rectified.  Can't say much for the dine in experience as I usually just place a to go order for here. It's a great option if you are looking for a quick fix on Korean fried chicken."}
{"text":"Unimpressed with the service, speed of food delivery, strange lack of alcohol at the bar and quality of food. Rice in bibimbop was dry, veggies were sparse and overall flavor was lacking. Apparently it takes time for the big ceramic bowl to heat up for the bibimbop but the kitchen should be prepared to coordinate a ticket so that one meal does not come out no less than ten minutes before the other. The staff seemed genuinely unconcerned wether or not we liked the meal as they passed quickly asking if \"everything is ok\". Poor showing Bonchon especially with an almost identical Korean restaurant next door."}
{"text":"The last time I had Korean food was in January in California and ever since then, I have been on a mission to find good Korean food here on the east coast! This place for sure fits the category! I would only choose a restaurant that served bibimbap in stone bowls and I was so excited that this place had it! Absolutely delicious! The potstickers were crispier than I'm used to, but that's completely ok with me! They were fantastic! Had a taste of my friend's Japchae with Bulgogi and I definitely recommend that as well. I had the bibimbap with bulgogi and was so satisfied. Their amounts are large, not more bang for your buck, but definitely worth what your paying for!"}
{"text":"OMG! The place is freakin amazing. I can't eat fried chicken anywhere else now that I've had Bonchon."}
{"text":"I will go and say it was the best fried chicken I have ever eaten. It stayed crispy and soft after it has been tossed the in sauce. Although next time I will just order the garlic Soy and not the spicy sauce. Hahahaha"}
{"text":"Service was terrible. The waitress seemed like she just wanted to get the order and leave. I tried to get some customer service out of her by asking her questions about the menu and what she liked. Her answers were very vague as if none of it was good and she was under pressure to answer a question. I smiled and kept trying but to no avail.   I got the bimimbap (sp) with spicy chicken. It was really good and pretty spicy. The only downfall was the stone dish it came out on. It was like food still cooking while you are eating. It never cooled down and was almost unpleasant to eat. Eventually it started make the rice crispy (which i really like) then burning. I had to ask for a regular bowl to save my dish.   Food is probably good service is appalling. I ended up leaving my togo plate by accident and came back for it but the waitress was very vague about throwing it away and tried to laugh it off. I just smiled shook my head and said thank you.   I came in with a few co workers around 4pm on a weekday"}
{"text":"Not bad but not great either. It's ok... There is a leadership issue in the restaurant. Note people standing around doing nothing or very little while one or two people struggle to take care of everyone. The food never tastes fresh. It taste like it's been under heat lamps for hours. Tried it twice, both times the same average food and poor service."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely delicious. Service was great. The entire restaurant was filled with Korean people, so you know the food has to be authentic. I like to judge an ethnic restaurant by the number of ethnic people eating there and this place was filled! Must check out!"}
{"text":"Their wings are addictive! Love them!! I have to order half the amount otherwise I will eat them all!"}
{"text":"Food was great the 2nd time as well. Service was ok. The server spoke so fast that he was hard to understand. Wine pouring etiquette knowledge needs to be brushed up on. Dirty glass, sent it back and the server brought the wine back in a wet glass. Had the spicy wings - excellent. Bulgogi was excellent. The restaurant started to get really busy around 7 pm Friday. Love that we have a good Korean place in Charlotte. I hope they add soju to the drink menu as an option."}
{"text":"I love their one of a kind cooked wings! But I wish they had more options for flavor. The garlic ones are disgusting. The other flavor is much better but I don't want spicy with an almost overly too sweet taste to it every time either, but at least it's good with rice. The crispness is what's addicting for sure. I had the salmon ball when they first opened and loved it. 2nd time I ordered it recently was strange,  the salmon was so hard you couldn't break a piece off with the fork,  half of it just came along with it when i tried instead.  Pretty bad sign & wasn't edible very disappointing and clearly not worth the price for that dish."}
{"text":"If you like spicy hot, this is for you!  Originally from Hawaii I am used to Korean food. The grocery stores sell Korean chicken which I love. It's mildly spicy with a honey overlay. I ordered the Spicy Wings at Bonchon. They smelled great, a little spicier than what I was used to in Honolulu. After a few bites I knew they were more than I could handle. The waitress had warned me but they were so spicy my ears were plugged, nose was running, lips were on fire. I ate half and took the rest home. Shared them with my neighbor who loves spicy food. He said he could only eat one a day. I'll probably go back and get them again, as spicy as they were they were still delicious ."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Korean fried chicken and it was amazing.It has a unique fried \"batter\" making it almost better than Southern fried chicken.I ordered the lunch option (appropriate price) wherein I received 8 wings and a side option.The wings were a great size.I ordered the wings half & half which were sweet and spicy.I prefer the spicy ones.My coleslaw was also tasty.I'm not sure what sauce they used on the coleslaw but I believe it was made from scratch.It was appetizing.  My waitress was very sweet and responsive to my needs (refills,napkins,asking was everything okay).I have recommended it to some friends and will definitely be going back myself."}
{"text":"Walked in order , customer service is A1 . I was interested in getting the chicken wings , curious about the spicy chicken . Host went out her way to get me some water and sample chicken strip to try before ordering full size. Very pleased with the service and the food !"}
{"text":"First, service was pretty terrible. It was not busy and it took forever for our food to come out. My wife's wrap then came to the table a good 7 minutes before my food came out. Server kept saying it's coming next but we waited. As for the food, it was mediocre. I got the bibimbap bowl and it was just a ton of rice with minimal chicken which you couldn't taste and a few veggies. Should have tried the fried chicken wings as that's what they are known for but I don't know if we will come back due to the service. Go elsewhere, waste of money here."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to give this place a try since I heard they served bibimbap, and I finaaaally got the chance to! Right when we walked in the lady at the reception which is the manager I think? Smiled and greeted us in(: We ordered the udon noodle soup, tofu bibimbap & a side of kimchi to share, I was sooo sad when our server told me they didn't serve the kimchi pancake anymore, booo. But I really like how the put all the calories of each dish on the menu, really helps when your trying to watch your weight lol! The udon noodle soup was so filling and, the flavor of the soup wasn't overwhelming and very light. (All for under 300 calories?? Yasss!) The bibimbap wasn't the BEST I had but it was very good as well, tofu was crunchy on the outside and very soft in the inside. The kimchi though... perfect! It was very very spicy, & the salt was on point! If you order the bibimbap you MUST get the kimchi to go with it, otherwise it would just lack flavor! Also during our meal the manager lady stopped by and checked on us, she's seems so sweet! I really like how the food didn't give us a \"food baby\" and how it was all lightweight & had a \"healthy\" feel!"}
{"text":"Ordered the bibimbap and was really happy with it. I added spicy chicken to it which added a lot of kick to it. I don't remember the sauce that came with it but it definitely added more spice to it. I'll definitely go back and give the fried chicken a try. Good, quick service. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Simply amazing chicken!... ultra crisy, ultra flavorful, soy garlic is really good, spicy is amazingly good( def has a kick).....only reason 4 stars over 5, is the wings are expensive (for wings), and slight off-putting smell during our visit....."}
{"text":"The chicken is delicious!!!!! And don'y pass on the parmesan fries. If though like things spicy the spicy check will not disappoint."}
{"text":"This was My first time here. The server brought me a sample of the chicken with the soy garlic and the spicy sauce before I ordered my meal. We ordered the seasoned fries, the potstickers with soy garlic sauce, house fried rice with no meat, wings with soy garlic sauce. The spicy sauce has a delayed effect, so if you do not like hot foods, try the soy garlic sauce. The seasoned fries are battered and fried hard but the fries are not dried out. They have Parmesan cheese on them with a little parsley. The potstickers are really tasty. The house fried rice a different. Good but different. The wings come in even number increments and they give you the same number of flats and drums. The wings come with pickled radishes to help cool your mouth and cleanse your palate. They give you a bucket to put your bones in for your table which is a great idea. Our server was attentive and nice. The chicken is really crispy but dried out either. All of the food came out really hot. I have not tasted their flavors anywhere else, so I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the wings and dumplings. Definitely gonna be in the wing joint rotation!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at this location before and it was decent then, this time I wasn't really impressed at all. My waitress was nice and I was seated right away, but that's about where the positives stop.   I ordered an order of Fried Shrimp Shumai. It was okay, nothing mind blowing or different from what I've had at normal Japanese restaurants. It didn't feel very Korean. Next I had an order of Pork Buns. They were probably the worst I've ever had. The cold slaw and sauce were so over powering that I could not taste the pork belly at all. The steam buns were not warm and almost cold. One fell apart and was firm. All things a steam bun should not be.   The Shumai didn't take very long to come out but the Pork Buns seemed to take forever. Which is crazy as it's just 3 tiny pieces of pork and everything else doesn't need to be warmed up. There were only two waitresses and they were both a little scattered around so it took longer than it should at some points due to that. Even the couple next to me made comments about her being busy. It wasn't really crowded at all, so I don't think the slowness was justified.   Being that I've had really awesome KBBQ wings and Pork Buns elsewhere, I don't see myself coming back. For the price, I expect a lot more in the flavor and quality department."}
{"text":"For a chain, this is very good and not sure why this location garnered 3.5 stars but we've been here twice and have came away pleased both times.  We ordered the bibimbap (5/5) and 2 orders of the Soy garlic wings (5/5) and there were shark eyes all around, so no problem here.  The service was excellent (5/5) as our server was friendly and prompt in her efforts.   It's a nice interior and functions well as seating feels ample and open (5/5).  We enjoyed ourselves immensely and highly recommend trying this place!"}
{"text":"I've enjoyed several dishes from Bonchon. I've visited for lunch and dinner and they weren't too crowded. The staff was friendly for the most part, and the restaurant was clean. I went with the chicken strips and white rice. They have 2 sauces - soy garlic and spicy. The soy garlic was really tasty.  The spicy was good as well and definitely had a \"kick\" to it. I actually asked for a bit more of the soy garlic sauce and the waiter said they couldn't provide it on the side which was really odd. The chicken was cooked perfectly and crispy yet juicy. I also tried the bulgogi recently and it was good also. It's a bit on the expensive side for the amount you get but it was flavorful. I'll stop back in here when I want some good ol fried chicken."}
{"text":"Wings were good other items on sampler platter not so much, stick with the wings. Service on the other hand was horrible. Part of group was done eating before last cood came out. Spend you money elsewhere, wings were good but not worth the poor service."}
{"text":"Had the chicken katsu and my friend got the half and half wings. Both were excellent!  We came on our hour lunch and got in and out quickly with awesome service.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ok, gave this place another shot. Called up to ask about seating outside and the lady was so nice to reserve us a table even though they dont. Then we order it was not busy at all, took forever to get 1 beer and all of our food orders came out individually not all at the same time. French fries came put first then our chicken strips abput 5 minutes after then 10 minutes later our daughters tacos. This always happens when we come here and now its just annoying. We ordered the soy garlic strips and they are amazing, the hot strips are insaaaanely hot.  Fries are fries and the bulgagi tacos are always good"}
{"text":"What a wonderful twist to Korean dining.  I was pleasantly surprised by the authentic taste of a franchise Korean eatery.  The fried chicken is fabulous.  Went with a large group and collectively we decided to order something different in order to sample as much as possible from the menu.  There is only one thing missing that would make eating here a true Korean dining experience is to serve sides with the meals, or at least add a dish of kimchee."}
{"text":"Absolutely awful. The food takes an hour while the other half of the table is enjoying their meal. The servers look like they have been through hell and back and hate life. Our server talked to us like we were high schoolers at a Waffle House at 3 am. Meanwhile I've been in the industry for over 7 years and I have never left a 10% tip in my life except for here. The server forgot to ring in my food and then started to get an attitude and roll her eyes at me, while I was being extremely polite and understanding. This place has a lot to work on and I'm very unimpressed."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a Friday afternoon and it wasn't terribly busy.  They have lunch specials from 11-3 so that was awesome!  I chose to get the soy garlic wings (how could I not?!). With the lunch special you get to choose from a list of complementary sides like fries, kimchi, and rice.  I got wings and fries.  My food came out piping hot and fresh!  The chicken was absolutely delicious!  It was flavorful and crispy!  The fries were hot and crispy too! Service was good as well. I will definitely be back!  They have other traditional Korean dishes as well so give them a try!"}
{"text":"I had to give this little place 5 stars...this is the best fried Chicken wings I have had the whole 13 years I have lived down in NC. Never have I ever quite so crispy of a wing...I have been always searching for a Crispy without being greasy wing. We had a big group, everyone had an assortment of Spicy, Soy , Drums,Wings  and Boneless Wings. I had the spicy, I loved them...just when you think it is too hot for your mouth the little bit of sweetness kicks in! We had the Pot Stickers, they were great and stuffed with filling. We had the Salmon ball, which was good and had crab and green onions inside and crispy panko chips on top. We had the Shrimp Shumai, which were darling little dumplings with a spicy wasabi mayo on top. We also tasted the Bulgogi tacos, which were delicious. This is not a fancy place, Water is served in plastic coke glasses, but the WINGS ARE STRAIGHT FROM FRIED HEAVEN!! Go...Go Now...."}
{"text":"Their wings are so bomb! Each bite had a crunch and the sauce were set (not drench) on the wings perfectly. I would say out of all the Wings I've had at other Korean restaurants, these were the best.  Warning: those spicy wings were really spicy.  Seasoned fries were good also. Ask for spicy mayo to dip with.   Spicy chicken Korean tacos were marinated in your traditional sauce that you would normally eat at KBBQ restaurants. Weren't my favorite but the chicken were abundant."}
{"text":"You would assume that all or most franchises would have the same quality control/customer service, but not in the case of this Bonchon location.  Definitely not what I expected compared to the awesome BonChon I've been to in KTown of NYC.  1. Let's talk about service.  If I walk in, I sort of expect to be seated if 3/4ths of the establishment is empty, but it doesn't help if you have servers mingling on the side.  2. Way overpriced for what you get including their bite sized apps.  3. Now quality from 1 to 10. Probably a 4. The flavor of the soy glazed wings were definitely on point, however, not good enough to compensate for the overly battered and overcooked wings.  This place could be a hit or miss, but I don't think I will be coming back a 2nd time to find out."}
{"text":"If you don't come in and eat the food and experience the freshness and the variety of the menu you're doing yourself a disservice!"}
{"text":"Went here on a whim because of the good reviews. We arrived around 730, we were told it would be a 40 minute wait but got called after 25, I was impressed.  And then it took 15 minutes to take our drink orders. By then we knew what we wanted to eat so we ordered our drinks, appetizer and entrees all at the same time.   I got my entree after an hour wait. About 5 minutes later she brought our appetizer out but it took another 20 minutes for my friend to get her entree. All together it took us 2+ hours to eat dinner..  The waitress was nice and apologized and brought us a free kimchi for the inconvenience but then told us that it was just a busy Saturday night like that excused the awful service. We watched at least 4 tables of people walk out without their food because of the crazy long wait times.  All that being said, the food was delicious and everything we expected it to be, but not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Can't beat Bonchon potstickers and wings.  Good drink specials at this location as well, with a solid selection of local craft beer on draft.  Very good service, both in the restaurant and to-go.  We have been to 3 different locations between DC, VA, and NC and this location didn't disappoint at all."}
{"text":"Yes!! Another Korean restaurant in Charlotte, NC! Now keep in mind you will not find traditional Korean food here. Bonchon is Americanized Korean food that will guarantee to make your taste palate dance. I have tried dishes from salmon avocado, Korean tacos to their infamous fried chicken. Everything was a hit! They also provide free pickled daikon aka radish.  Free stuff is always a plus :)"}
{"text":"I was not impressed. Our waitress was really good, so that was a plus. But the food was bland and nothing special. The fried rice did not have much flavor, the potstickers were a little to crispy so it really impeded the flavor. The only thing that I felt had flavor was the chicken wings. They were crispy and the soy-ginger flavor was really good. Other than that, I don't really think we would go back."}
{"text":"The wings are the best I've had by far in fried wings.  The soy garlic flavor was delicious!  The bibimbap on the other hand was not good at all, no flavor too much rice and barely enough meat.  Salmon avocado ball was great.  The service was awesome.  The Korean tacos and bao buns were not that great.  Food is very pricey like the seasoned fries for $7 is just overly price for some fries.  All and all I would definitely just come for the wings very well worth it."}
{"text":"My wife and I got a very simple Togo order and they got one of the main dishes we ordered completely wrong. We waited 30 minutes for it and it was moderately busy on a Friday night. We waited for our food at the bar for which there was no bartender. (And no music, so it was dead quiet) We didn't realize that they had gotten the order wrong until we got home and when I went back to get my correct meal they offered no apologies or anything. Needless to say, we won't be returning."}
{"text":"You don't serve burnt rice to a customer. Maybe the server should inform the customer how hot the pot is. But burnt rice is a no no for me."}
{"text":"My disinter raves about this place so I decided to give it a shot. Unfortunately she didn't tell me until after that it's because of their chicken. So I of corse order bulgulgi (beef) at a chicken place.  It wasn't too bad. I'd eat it again it was just a little sweeter and smaller pieces of beef than I am use to. I also had the shrimp dumplings which were different than I was expecting but good. They came with a sweet cream sauce on top. Needless to say I will be heading back to try to the chicken and will update my review when i do."}
{"text":"Spicy Korean fried chicken at its best! So good! They also have a variety of other Korean apps and dishes if your not looking to clog your arteries.. Fast service and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Service is terrible but food well worth going back again. Came with my husband on a Saturday evening, 15 minutes after taking our drink and food order, our server never got our water, she went around refilling water for other guests, giving out carry out boxes and checks and literally ignored us until I flagged her down. Then she apologized. Really? This is a small place, you couldn't even see the two guests who just arrived had no drinks while you went around refilling drinks for all your other tables?   We ordered the 10pcs combo wings as appetizer but it ended up coming out after the main entrees. Soy garlic flavor is delicious and very crispy, the hot and spicy flavor was FIRE, my entire face and chest were burning up, order only if you can handle a 8 out of 10 spiciness.    The pork buns were amazing, soft fluffy taco-like white buns with tender pork belly and very flavorful mayo sauce. The stir fried clear noodle was also delicious, a bit on the sweeter side and loaded with veggies and meat.   Portion size is good, at the end we had a bit of leftover. Knowing it is grand opening I hope they work their kinks out with the service, both waiting staff and kitchen seemed overwhelmed and a bit chaotic. This is close to home I will definitely try again in a few weeks."}
{"text":"Absolute favorite chicken- maybe the sauce or the awesome array of Asian sides- pickled radish!!! Kimchi,  seasoned fries oh my!   We just love everything we've had here."}
{"text":"You won't be disappointed at all with the Korean Fried Chicken. I have to say that I was a little skeptical before eating it, being a southern guy and all. We take our fried chicken very seriously! As a matter of fact, don't expect anything like the regular chicken you're used to. This is a very (did I mention, VERY) crispy fried chicken. There are two main flavors, Spicy and Soy Garlic. You can also get it with the two flavors mixed. The chicken is moist on the inside. The flavors a little on the sweet and savory side. I also ordered the pork belly buns. The best I had so far!  The staff there is very friendly and attentive. Although quite crowded during peak times, they do a great job of getting you in pretty quickly. Location: Once you park, take the stairs to left to the bottom level. Their located on the righthand corner."}
{"text":"I'm a fan.  I actually like Korean style crispy wings, so I tried a combination of their regular wings (they also have Drums and Strips) . I got half Soy Garlic (my favorite) and 5 half & Half (their regular sauce, but half as spicy.  I will say, the Half and Half, still had a nice kick to it!  It came with a side of Pickled Radish squares, which were tasty and a nice pallet cleanser.  It looks like they have a lot of other stuff to try like different noodle dishes and appetizers.  I look forward to round two."}
{"text":"I like many others was excited to try this place. We went there on a Thursday night at about 8:15 and were greeted by the hostess and were told that there was an hour wait. At first I thought she was joking because there were empty tables everywhere and nobody waiting anywhere. There was actually a fairly large party that was walking out of the restaurant that had just finished up as we were walking in. We looked around and decided to leave and when we left the hostess said \"I knew it.\" Needless to say we won't be returning back. Take your business to Seoul Meat Company. Their wings and food are excellent and the service is always great."}
{"text":"Good but not great. The only other time I've had Bonchon was in Philadelphia. We went to the Park Toad location about a week after the grand opening and it was packed! Really encouraging to see Charlotte come out and support the city's developing cuisines. We ordered the half and half combo, the salmon avocado roll, the japchae, and the pork belly buns. The fried chicken is not as crispy or as big as the other Bon Chon I've been to (I think this location uses more sauce) but overall still good. I knew this going in, but a forewarning to those who haven't tried the spicy. It's VERY spicy (even though all my Korean friends say it's just normal lol). It's the kind of spice that stays with you, which is not my favorite, because then it ruins the taste of any other foods you eat after. Japchae was awesome and a big portion. Pork belly buns are okay - definitely have had better. Salmon avocado roll was good as well."}
{"text":"I know I probably over-hyped myself for the arrival of Bonchon since I had tried it up in Washington DC.  My first experience was a \"slow\" Sunday evening.  Only a couple tables around.  We were seated right away, but service was at a very relaxed pace (for the place being THAT slow).  Either way, the chicken was still solid and we tried the shrimp schuman as an app.  Anything that is twice fried is definitely on my radar, but the entire experience of the restaurant wasn't well rounded.  Maybe they had a ton of last minute Sunday evening take-out orders.... but maybe that's the route to go for next time.  We did look at the dessert menu.... but we decided on walking across the way to Ben & Jerry's instead."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the chicken here. I did carryout and when they said 15 minutes They meant 15 minutes. There is a full bar as well inside if you want a quick drink with your food. This was also my 1st time going and I am happy with everything. I'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Good flavors in both the wings but instead of takeaway i think i need to eat in the restaurant to get the full effect of the crispy chicken, overall i really liked it and will eat here again or at another bonchon"}
{"text":"I'll give it 3 for the ok service, nice atmosphere & crispiness.    Two flavor choices... Soy Ginger & I can't eat that spicy.  Found out after you can order naked.  Decent tap beers.    I'd go again for drinks and to try some other appetizer type fare."}
{"text":"Chicken was good. Bibimbap had good flavor, but the way it's served makes the rice hard at the bottom. Onion rings were obviously frozen. Service never refiled our drinks once."}
{"text":"I was first introduced to bonchon in Richmond, Virginia. To finally get one in Charlotte was so exciting! I love their spicy wings over the soy garlic. You can't get extra sauce on the side but you can get it extra saucy if that makes sense, lol. The wings are the perfect amount of crunchy. The bibimbap is really good esp with the red sauce. If you let it sit the rice gets a little crispy."}
{"text":"I am from Chicago and I really enjoyed this fried chicken at a Korean restaurant on Lawrence Ave that I have long since forgotten. Bonchon is second only to that place for fried chicken. Kimchee was OK but a bit too mild for me."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best fried wings I have ever tasted! They are so crispy! The service at the bar was exceptional! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"They've been around for a while now and it seems that they have figured things out and ironed out the new-restaurant kinks. The waitstaff knows their products and seem comfortable with the environment, which is very important to things running smoothly. The   Still haven't ordered anything other than the chicken.... it's just so good."}
{"text":"Bon Chon is the wing king! #thatisall  I mean honestly I don't know what else to say. The wings are fried to perfection with just the right out of crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. How often do you find a wing with sauce that's still crispy and not dry... how often sway? Exactly!   As if the wings aren't enough, the fried rice is my actual reason to visit. Since moving from Northern NJ I haven't found a place with fried rice that rivaled my NYC favs but Bon Chon has filled that void. The fried rice with Bugogi is everything."}
{"text":"I love KFC - no, not the Colonel's chicken! I'm talking about Korean Fried Chicken. Yea, it's a thing. Kind of strange at first - I usually consider good fried chicken a Southern US staple. But the Koreans give us a run for our money!   There are some distinct differences between Korean fried chicken and the chicken you get at Chinese restaurants or American places. Chinese restaurants use corn starch breading and Americans vary but typically use all purpose flour breading. Koreans use rice flour and a double fry method to get the right crisp texture. Then they smother on the sauces. Here, you have a choice of either spicy or sweet and savory soy garlic.   I came here with the hubs, our son and my Mom. Five minutes after sitting down, my nephew and his friends walk in. We didn't plan this. They showed up out of nowhere. We live about 45 minutes apart and this place is the midpoint. Out of all the restaurants in the are, we chose the same one at the same time. We had two separate checks and It came down to the exact same amount. Coincidence?!?!  Nah, I believe that's God telling us to eat here more often!   I've been here before and ordered the wings I love. The rest of my party were KFC virgins so we ordered a variety of foods for everyone to try.  Let's start with the wings. The crispy crunchy chicken exterior can't be described. You have to taste It to truly know how divine It is. Its sauced by either spicy or soy garlic but the breading stays crispy the whole time! The chicken is served with pickled cubes radishes. Sounds weird at first but it's a perfect bite to cut the grease and spice from the chicken.   Now onto the other dishes:  Hubs ordered bulgolgi, fried rice and kimchi. My mom ordered japchae and an appetizer of octopus chunks. Everything was so delicious! The service was also great! Drinks were kept refilled, the waitress was an excellent resource in helping us order and the food came out promptly.   It wasn't very busy here on a Saturday night but I think people are sleeping on this joint. It's by far more delicious than other Korean joints that aren't authentic. Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"I've had Bonchon up in Northern VA when visiting my cousins over the holidays. Naturally I was excited to see a branch open in Charlotte. My brother and I went for a Sunday dinner during my last visit one month ago. It wasn't busy so we were seated immediately. Our server was nice, but didn't really check up on us during our meal. I really did want more water.  Anyway, we came for their signature chicken. After trying the Shrimp Schuman (Fried) to tide us over, I was awaiting the crispy, saucy goodness. The shumai was blah and the honey Dijon sauce was too sweet. We ordered the medium Signature Fried Chicken in Soy Garlic drums (8 pieces) that came with two sides of the pickled radish. The chicken was as crispy and juicy as I remembered. The sauce was flavorful. The fries were also good, thick, nice and crispy, and an evenly seasoned batter.  Glad to hear Bonchon will be opening in a Chicago soon. It'll have some stiff competition with local standards, but always nice to have another option to get my fried chicken fix."}
{"text":"Horrible service... don't go there for lunch if you have 2hrs for lunch... they rather get to go lunches ready before your dishes..ridiculous...."}
{"text":"I have now been to this restaurant three times . The food is good but I have a hard time with each time I order the kimchi pancakes I get different stories as to why they don't have them. 1st time about a month ago didn't have the ingredients , second time two weeks ago , kitchen doesn't have enough staff to make them. And today they can't make them until corporate reviews the restaurant to approve. I fell they are some lies here."}
{"text":"It was okay. The food was pretty quick and there was a deal where we could get free fries if we checked in on a social app which was nice. The servers were pleasant. The food was okay. It wasn't the best food I've ever had, but it wasn't bad. The flavors in the sauce on the chicken weren't my favorite but other things on the menu might be better."}
{"text":"Went to try this place on a Sunday afternoon. I'd never been there before. This was a casual little place with a cozy interior with a bar and  6 TVs.  We were seated immediately, and a few minutes later our waitress came back and we placed our order. Not too long after our food came out. And that's basically when the service stopped. No one came to check on us, refill our water, see if we liked the food. We had to flag down a waiter eventually, because none of them were looking in our direction. We finally got our waters refilled, and we sent back the calamari because it tasted terrible. The restaurant did get a bit busy after we placed our order, but that's no excuse for the terrible service we received.  While the food was not bad, our experience was, and therefore we will not be going back. Would not recommend"}
{"text":"Wow!  Food and service both were on point. Ordered the chicken wings, drumsticks, potstickers, and salmon ball.  The spicy is really spicy!! So be warned.  The soy is so flavorful.  All were amazing.  Service was great.  Bar still isn't open, so be prepared for soda or water.  Easiest five star rating ever!  Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Although Bonchon is an Americanized version of Korean food, I'm glad this chain made it to Charlotte...in more than 1 location.  I've been to both locations (Woodlawn and Pineville-Matthews), and I've been fairly happy with all the foods I've ordered.  As expected, the chicken is delicious... double-fried and heavily seasoned.  I've also tried and liked their Bulgogi Wrap, BiBimBap, Tacos, Pork Buns, JapChae, Fried Rice, Potstickers (Yes, I've been there several times by now...so this is actually a cumulative review)...and surprisingly, Kimchee tasted very authentic!  The only item that I tried and found disappointing was Tteokbokki...not even semi-authentic.  Being Korean, I've tried many truly delicious Tteokbokki, and this is just not it.  Though I'm not big into chain restaurants, I welcome BonChon for the simple fact that it's a great restaurant for folks who never tried Korean foods.  It's very inviting, with an Americanized Korean menu, complete with pictures!  If you haven't been, you should give it a try...if only for its super-charged chicken!"}
{"text":"I finally had the opportunity to try this place and I am glad that I did. My family ordered the wings and then I ordered the tacos. This place was really good. It was definitely something different, which is great. I would recommend this place, especially if you are craving wings."}
{"text":"The chicken is just that good , no soggy skin here and a perfect crunch without the excessive flour coating . If you've had the pleasure of visiting a Bon Chon in another location then you will know what the hype is about . -so I leave you with 4stars , nom nom   Let's address the issues because I feel the food will speak for itself if you get your correct order . We called in our order at 11:10 and arrived at the resturant at 11:40 , we had to wait an additional 20 minutes for it to be ready . 1) ordered the 1/2 and 1/2 combo lunch , supposed to be 4 wings and two drums , mixed with soy garlic &spicy . Bon Chon, I'm all for free food but if you continue to give people more than what they paid for, your revenue will be all screwed up. We ended up with 6wings and 4 drums , one box was mixed  flavors , one box was all soy ginger .   2) you are an Asian fusion resturant how did you not have white rice cooked and ready, I'm still in shock . So we were given the fries instead which are delicious by the way , However I wanted rice to eat with my side of   3) kimchi cole slaw , where was it ???? Instead I was given a side of kimchi. Good thing I can eat kimchi with anything, but not good that it's not much of a work food you crack open for others to smell .   To sum this all up , get organized , please ... I would hate for others to not enjoy the yummy factor due to disoriented employees and incorrect food orders ."}
{"text":"Hands down the best fried chicken wings I've ever tasted. Perfect balance of sweet/savory umami!!! Delicious. Been here multiple times and I've never been disappointed!! The fries are yummolicious too. Nothing bad to say."}
{"text":"Great chicken. Nice and crispy. The fries and slaw were good too.  It was my first time so the waitress gave us a sample which was really great because the spicy is HOT yet tasty. The flat portion of the wing had the tip attached which really made me happy. If you enjoy crispy chicken I suggest you try this place. Make sure you dine in so that you experience the chicken while it is fresh and crisp."}
{"text":"Best wings I've EVER had. the crispiness is phenomenal. We got the soy garlic flavor."}
{"text":"I'm in love with the wings, it definitely has the crisp and the right texture. I also ordered the salmon avocado ball which I felt was okay. A lot smaller than I expected. I'm not so much for any coleslaw but their kimchi coleslaw was very good. Of course, I came during soft opening so the service was still quite not there yet. I do hope they get it together because I expect my next dine in experience to be more time efficient and enjoyable. ;)"}
{"text":"Finally in Charlotte!! Loved. Bonchon in D.C. Moved here waiting for bonchon. Yay!!!! So good"}
{"text":"As is customary for all but a very select few (even that is a stretch) of the Korean and Japanese restaurants in Charlotte Bonchon fails to deliver the correct level of flavor these cuisines should have. The right flavors are there but at a 25% intensity.   We ordered the drums half soy garlic and half spicy, the bulgogi bibimbap, and the kimchi. The wings were decent but just needed double the flavor. This could be a result of the cuts of chicken they use compared to how they do it in Korea. If you've ever had KFC in Korea you will know how they use an entire chicken cut into medium pieces which lends to a perfect batter to chicken ratio, not to mention that you get dark meat and white meat. So there is a bit too much chicken to crust/sauce in these americanized chicken cuts. Doubt I will find myself craving these like I used to crave Kyochon Chicken in Seoul. The bimbimbap was a super disappointment. None of the veggies had any flavor therefore the dish severely lacked throughout. Even an excess of gochujang couldn't quite save it. If you've ever had authentic Korean food, skip this dish FOR SURE. The kimchi was fine, but it really should have come with the bimbimbap instead it is $2-3 bucks for what tastes like packaged kimchi, and it wasn't spicy in the slightest.  I didn't have any problem with the service like a lot of the other reviewers so maybe they have worked those kinks out. I just wish the food was up to par, especially considering the price you pay. So sad too, I'm sure I will give it a second shot though because I was really excited to have this place in town :/"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 lunch specials $8.95 each and it was pretty good! I selected the Bonchon Wrap with Bulgogi (beef). Crispy outside wrap, filled with delicious meat and slightly spicy sauce drizzled with the dark lettuce filled inside, no iceberg here, thank goodness. I would order this again. There is also a chicken option.  Hubby loved the Signature Fried Chicken with spicy sauce. Sooooo crispy! If you like vinegar, check out the Pickled Radish side... its sweet but so crunchy! The fries as a side are much more filling if you're hungry though.  I ordered an additional appetizer side of Takoyaki: Fried octopus dumplings drizzled with Japanese mayonnaise, Katsu sauce and sprinkled with bonito flakes. The smell was overwhelmingly fishy and unfortunately they were soggy and unappetizing. I ate 2 and felt sick, I'm going to have to call and get a refund for them, they were just no where near right."}
{"text":"I was soooo afraid that it wouldn't taste as good as it did in New York-- but not only was it super delish- it was better than what I remembered in NY! The spicy fried chicken was super spicy and the crisp on the chicken was just perfect. Also, the seasoned fries were amazing. A little pricey for lunch but very delish and fulfilling! Service was great too."}
{"text":"Only come here if you want the fried chicken. It is fried perfectly and stays crunchy!! Sauce is...okay. Good enough. They should consider more variety since their chicken is fried perfectly. I wish they would marinate the meat though. The flavor comes from the outside but once you get inside, there's barely any flavor so the smell of bare chicken may be strong. Had their bibimbap. Don't. It's not worth the price. Just order white rice :p Their octopus balls were decent. A little salty for me but it's a wonderful starter. I probably won't be back though. I'll recommend you to give it a try so you can get a taste. It's not bad but I'm not going to praise it."}
{"text":"Not a good start....   I'm sitting here waiting for my wings. I've been waiting for 30 minutes.  It's only 5:30. It's not busy.   Got the wings. Great wings.  Got both varieties.  I ordered only wings but looks like I got some drums.   Oh well.  Spicy is, well, pretty seriously spicy.    Bulgogi.  Eh.  Not good. Not good at all.  Not much  flavor.     Service is pretty bad.  Hopefully this place gets it together and can figure out how to make more than wings."}
{"text":"Overall pretty bad experience. Despite having 3 stars we wanted to give the restaurant the benefit of the doubt and try it out. Shouldn't have. We ordered 10 wings & a noodle dish pretty quickly after we sat down per our waitresses recommendation. After 45 minutes still no food had arrived and our waitress never came over to check on us. Finally someone drops off the noodle dish, and right as we are about to dive in, they came back over and took it back stating it was for a different table...about 10 min later they brought out wings (very over fried and SO spicy, but the bonchon ones had a good taste). When we asked the waitress what happened to our other dish she blamed it on the food runner saying he messed it up and they had to \"start over\". After we finished the chicken and aimlessly waiting for his meal to come, they brought his out... not even acknowledging that at this point it's been over an hour. We also had no water refill and when we asked for it, she again blamed it on other people saying it wasn't her fault. Def won't be coming here again. Bad service = bad business. Also they had a leaking air vents that was landing on customers and their food (pic attached) #notcute"}
{"text":"So this was my first time dining in and I'll say it actually wasn't bad at all. So I ordered the Chicken Katsu and it was pretty good, not the best I've ever had but definitely a solid one. The Katsu is sliced a little thin but it still tastes good. Now the wings, those are pretty great. There are only 2 flavors soy garlic and spicy. The soy garlic is definitely tasty and the spicy flavor is most definitely spicy and that is coming from someone that almost always eats spicy food. So yes it is really good but I warn you to be careful if you haven't had spicy foods before, definitely not an entry level spice. But yet again it is tasty. The Wings have a really awesome crisp to them, if you go thinking they're gonna feel like KFC style Chicken you will be pleasantly surprised that they are way better. I personally am not a fan of the pickled radish. But overall experience was great, not enough to be 5 stars but just slightly scraping at it. I may give it more stars after trying more dishes."}
{"text":"Two stars = \"Meh. I've experienced better\" and it's true - I've experienced MUCH better at other BonChon locations. I've lived in both VA and NYC, where there are koreatowns and multiple BonChon locations. The Korean chicken wings and fried accompaniments are always on point for dine-in or take out. I was SO excited when I heard a BC was opening in Charlotte. After 3-4 months of delay, it finally opened!  My husband suggested we wait a few weeks until the kinks get sorted out, but I couldn't wait because I wanted my spicy chicken wings.  We got there about 5:30 on a Friday and there were multiple tables available. After attempting to give our order to the first waitress and discovering she knew MINIMAL English, another waitress showed up and appeared very flustered...it was still pre-dinner rush!?! We ordered the onion rings, edamame, 10 wings half (soy garlic) & half (spicy) and bibimbap. Onion rings and edamame came out quickly and both were very good. The onion rings were crunchy and the kids ate it up. During the following 20 minutes that followed while we were waiting on the rest of our food, we noticed the tables next to us and in front of us all had issues with their orders. When our wings arrived, we noticed they were drumsticks and told the waitress. She said these are wings but larger, even though these were clearly drumsticks. She went back to the kitchen and came back, trying to educate us on the different parts of a wing - which these were NOT. After all her babbling, my husband motioned over to the next table that had wings and told her - \"those are wings, these are drumsticks.\" She walked back to the kitchen and came back 5 minutes later to tell us it'll be out in a few minutes. Five minutes later, we've got our half and half wings but we couldn't tell which ones were soy garlic vs. spicy, and of course our waitress couldn't tell us either. Still no bibimbap though and I had to follow up on it a couple times before I finally got it.  Chicken verdict:The spicy flavor is TOO spicy and we love spicy foods. I've had spicy at other locations and it's not usually this spicy. Beware and make sure the kids don't accidentally get a spicy piece of chicken because it is painfully spicy, overpowering the taste. Your lips are burning and your mouth is on fire for hours. The soy garlic wings were tasy when I had to confirm they were in fact soy garlic for the kids, but after eating a spicy wing, you couldn't really taste the soy garlic wing because your mouth and lips were still on fire. The white radish side dish is a good complement, but you always need more of it if you've got more than one radish-chicken combo lover.  Bibimbap verdict: Plentiful vegetables and a decent dish...not one of the best, but OK for a fast casual. Overall, could use more flavor and sesame oil. Also, could do without the yellow radish.  It took 10-15 minutes to get the check. By that time, tables were packed and there was a long wait in and out of the restaurant. I was really worried for all those diners. Service needs some MAJOR improvement. I'm not sure where they got these servers, but management clearly needs to invest in some quality employees (go visit Chick-Fil-A!) that can deliver consistently good service.  I'll give it a couple months and try take-out, if they're ready for take-out by then!"}
{"text":"Ive gone to Bonchon on quite a few times, one time we sat at the bar because tables were full but service was good. The second time we went close to closing and sat at a table and received quick service and one time I called in the order and by time I got there it was ready. My favorite is the Shrimp Shumai with a side of white rice and the half and half Soy Garlic wings. The wings are definitely excellent, nice and crispy and done all the way through but not burned. I even put my son on to them and he's 16 and he absolutely loved the wings!"}
{"text":"Best Korean chicken wings you'll ever eat! Hot, crisp and the perfect amount of heat. So many places do bad versions of this style of wings with their over tempura battered flappers. Not Bonchon, these wings where cooked to perfection. We tried the Bull Dak which is spicy chicken stir fry (warning: this dish is not for the faint of heart... this will light you up!) Loved it but if you're at all sensitive to heat stay clear of this one. The price was on point and portion sizes are big.   We came for the soft opening. One can only expect a little longer wait for tables and food. I'm sure once they hit their groove, food will start flying out the window. Service was prompt and friendly.   Fingers crossed, I hope this place out lives it's predecessors."}
{"text":"The chicken is really good! I love the radish. It goes so well with chicken. I would definitely would go there again. But I am broke."}
{"text":"Overpriced and not that good. Don't ask for extra chicken sauce, they will not give or sell you any. The hot sauce was the best part and actually hot."}
{"text":"Spicy chicken.  That about sums this place up.  I, for one, was not impressed.  It wasn't horrible, but 5 drums set me back 12 bucks before tip.  The atmosphere didn't wow me either.  I'm not so sure this place will beat the curse of their dwelling.  They also win for one of the tiniest men's bathrooms in Charlotte.  You'll hit your head while trying to use the hand dryer, and you should pray no one comes bursting through the bathroom door while you're standing there. If so, you may just get a black eye, if not just full on knocked out.  I cannot speak for anything other than the chicken, but I don't think I'll be back to explore the menu any further."}
{"text":"My cousin chose this place for our lunch date. She loves the fried chicken.  They are brand new so they have some things to iron out, our wait time was really long but the food was good. I got the seafood fried rice and avocado and crab. The avocado and crab reminded me a lot of a sushi roll. I think that they are slightly over priced for the portion size that you receive, but I would definitely give them another try in a few months to see if they have ironed out their operations. They are definitely worth a try though."}
{"text":"Accidental Saturday night food run!! Me and my homegirl wanted to get a drink so we went in because they have a bar. I got a dish that started with a P. Which had beef, noodles, and some veggies. It was good AF!! And I also got the chicken wings. I got half and half soy garlic and spicy. The spicy was too hot. The soy garlic won me over. The menu is sort of pricey but the food is good. I also had a peach martini. Which was nothing more than vodka and peach nectar. However I was feeling nice after drinking it. I'll be going there for wings again and while I wait for my wings I'll get a drink. This was a hit for me."}
{"text":"Everything we tried here was mediocre except for the fries. There are signs on the tables to sign up for something and when you do you can get a free order of fries. My sister did it, so we got to try the fries, nice and crispy and hot. We also got the shumai, some chicken wings, half and half sauce, and an order or bibim bap. We finished the shumai, fries, and the bibim bap. The sauce and coating on the wings were not very good. The spicy was way too spicy for us but maybe we could have eaten it if the breaded coating wasn't so thick. It was my first time having korean wings, maybe it's just not my thing but the other food wasn't very good either."}
{"text":"Dare I say it? Please Lord bless them chicken drum sticks! Finger licking good! I've become a huge fan!"}
{"text":"I have to say, the early negative reviews about service are a bit unfair for such a new restaurant. This place has worked out all the kinks since opening up. Service is efficient and the staff is great. They're also doing takeout now. The food is prepared well, and delicious. Just went in for some chicken and bulgogi. The portions were large, chicken was moist and delicious, bulgogi was enjoyable, and the beer was cold. Really happy to have a BonChon in Charlotte and I hope they do well."}
{"text":"We love good food. Hubby and I just returned home from our weekend celebration of our anniversary. He has passed this place multiple times and wanted to try it. We walk in good music is playing. We were seated immediately. Our drink orders were taken promptly. We like fast and friendly service. I beleive the waitress was new but we'll get to that shortly. We ordered to start calamari one of our favorite apps. He ordered the wings soy garlic I ordered the fried rice with chicken and shrimp.  The calamari was huge it came in a fluted vase like bowl that for one person would be an entire meal. There was no dipping sauce or lemon. Ok so we asked for lemon and dipping sauce. The waitress made us feel like we inconvenienced her by asking for this. I dont know of more than a few fried foods that do not come with dipping sauces. Calamari however is not one of those foods that do not come with sauce. We order siracha sauce but it was too spicy for hubby so we sent the entire dish back. Disappointed!!! Next up was our meal, the wings PERFECTLY fried. Crispy and not over cooked. The sauce mediocre. I love the crispness of the wings. Again there was no sauce we like Bleu cheese but at least we were able to get ranch. The wings come with a radish relish that is delish. I ate that in place of my food.  The rice was ok. It didn't have enough flavor to WOW me. It was ok. I took it home bc I couldn't eat it. I'm doctoring it tonight for dinner.  Because of the constant  change of our waitress' demeanour when asked for something, along with only liking one out of the 3 items that were ordered, I would not recommend this place for anything but the wings. That itself is another issue I have. There are more flavors of Korean bbq than just spicy and soy ginger. Why not add those flavors? Fried food should also come with dipping sauces along with the option of salt and peper. And lastly waitresses  should be accustomed to being asked for things. The waitress we had changed her demeanor and her face if we asked for anything. Not cool"}
{"text":"Food is average to say the most. Tried all kinds of food on the menu: the fried chicken; Takoyaki; Salmon Ball; popcorn chicken (too much breaking, tiny piece of chicken)... Great location though."}
{"text":"I'm a Korean fried chicken convert. The skin is SUPER crispy and both flavors are delicious. Be prepared that their hot wings are actually hot, not just a little warm like some places.   Whether dining in or carrying out, I've always gotten at least 10-20 wings and it never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Service was slow (and there were barely any people eating at the restaurant) and the food wasn't that great. I was expecting more from a Korean restaurant. Felt more like a fast food chain than a sit-down eatery."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. I was super excited to try this place. It was about time Charlotte got some Korean Fried Chicken. It took us a long time to try the place - just life happens and it has even taken me longer to write the review. Overall, I was just underwhelmed with the place.   My experience with Korean Fried Chicken (KFC) is very different than this location. I have gone to Bonchon in other cities and my expectations were high. Typically, when going out to eat for KFC - you would call in your order before you get there. The reason for this is because they make every order fresh. It takes a good 30-40 minutes to cook the chicken the correct way. And if you don't call it in before you get there, they will tell you it will take that long. But normally this fine. You come with friends, have some drinks, some appetizers and all is well.  So I was so confused when my chicken wings came out literally less than 10 minutes after ordering. They were flavored well & crispy. Just not that piping hot and fresh crispy that I am accustomed to.   My man wanted to try the chicken strips so we did - and I say definitely pass on these. The wings win hands down.   We also ordered seasoned fries - they were a frozen variety. Fried well and alright with us. On the chicken wings and strips - we ordered half and half on both. The soy was sweet and the spicy had a nice heat to it. The flavor was there and definitely did not disappoint. But it just blew my mind that they could have our chicken ready so fast. It means they do the first fry early and they do the 2nd fry when you order. This does not optimize for the best KFC in my opinion. The chicken wings were definitely the best part of our meal however.  Also order the Tapoyaki - and these are not for the faint of heart. They have a fishy taste to them and this could not fair well with most but I really enjoyed them. They were warm and overall okay! The japchae was okay as well. Seasoned fairly. I took them home and jazzed them up a bit. And the sliders were actually fair. They were just super sweet and a little dry."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this new Korean franchise. My expectation was probably set to high when i looked up the place to get some info when they were still constructing. So finally they open and of course I gave it like 2-3 month for them to get situated before going. We had a big party, about say around 15 people. There was a long wait to get seated but we didn't have any reservations so thats our fault. No complaints on that. Finally once we get seated they only had one waitress to serve us so it took forever for her take our orders. It also took eternity for them to make the food. It feels like they only had like two chef and the place was busy. The food was brought out at different times so some was left staring at the ones that was eating and we all finish our meals at different times. Two of our party didn't even receive their food at all but still got charged for it!?!? So we had to modify the bill.    Food... the tuna avocado ball was awesome. Fried chicken was very spicy and a little on salty side ( would taste great if you have a side of white rice). Didn't care for the stone pot rice dish, had it better at other Korean places.  The bulgogi (Korean bbq) was just ok. This place was not yet organized for a big party. Very slow on the whole experience and the Korean food is not authentic tasting to me (more americanized). I don't think i will give this place a second try. Not a good first visit but maybe because they are too new and needed a little more time and experience. Hope you have a better experience than i did if you try it out."}
{"text":"Never go here. Coworker and I got food poisoning here. When I told them they could care less. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Tip!  Not a huge fan of their pickled ginger - substitute it for their cole slaw for free!"}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place out because of the \"hype.\" It's supposedly known as the best \"Korean Fried Chicken.\" The wings were ok. I've had better! The spicy wings were definitely better than the soy garlic. If I wanted Korean wings, I would rather go to Seoul Food. Here at BonChon, there was too much breading on the wings and barely any meat. I ordered the pork belly buns- these were delicious. My boyfriend ordered the Korean chicken tacos and he enjoyed them. The food did take 30 minutes to come out. Service was ok. Would I come back? Probably just for the pork belly buns."}
