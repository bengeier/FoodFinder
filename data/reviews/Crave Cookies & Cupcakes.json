{"text":"It's cupcakes. Really how can I say anything bad? Well they are pricey and they only have two types of cupcakes that have cream cheese icing (red velvet and dark angel) but they are both soooooo good!  Just wish they had more flavours, I don't know why but just prefer cream cheese over buttercream.   I do wish they had better hours though, closing at 7 pm is a bit early.  Also at the time of writing this the location is totally wrong on the map, this location is right in Aspen Landing."}
{"text":"Sooo good! Initial reaction is shock when you see how much they are but definitely worth it!  I recommend getting the mini's so you can sample different kinds!"}
{"text":"Having been here on many occasions, I can say it definitely doesn't disappoint. Although rather pricey for a cupcake, the taste is quite divine. The cake is spongy and moist while the buttercream is smooth and flavourful. I have yet to try all the varieties, but my favourite go to flavour is the crave-o-licious. Since I've been scaling back on my sugar intake the past year or two, I did find their cupcakes to be really, really sweet by the time you're half way through one so I would recommend buying the mini ones instead. Overall, a good place to go to if you're craving something sweet."}
{"text":"Since the first day I moved to Calgary, I have heard great things about Crave Cupcakes. Now, I'm not really much of a cupcake kinda guy.  My lady, however, well that's another story.  I think she avoided trying Crave's cupcakes at first out of fear of addiction - what you don't know can't hurt you. Finally, someone brought in a box if mini cupcakes to her work where she was forced against her will to try one. And ever since, I make semi-regular runs to Crave to pick up a treat for my sweet. Crave puts a lot of effort into their work, using only quality ingredients and each cake is decorated up with a ton of perfectly swirled icing.  And they use fun flavours, like Velvet Elvis, which is cream cheese icing atop a red velvet cupcake.  They even have decorated cakes, like their bugs collection, including little bumblebees and ladybugs.   Apparently the cupcakes from Buttercream Bakery have better icing, according to the expert in our house, but the Crave location in Aspen Landing is more convenient than any of the Buttercream locations, and I haven't heard any complaining when I bring home Crave's cakes!"}
{"text":"I don't know what happened, cost cutting or what. January lemon lime twist cupcake wonderful. June confetti birthday cake wonderful. September lemon lime twist birthday cake FLAVOURLESS and TOO SWEET. Of course it was my birthday cake. $45. Way too much for this."}
{"text":"I went to Crave on Friday before lunch to get some celebratory mini-cupcakes and cookies. The cupcakes were wonderful but the $5 I spent on the two stale, dry cookies felt like a complete waste of money."}
{"text":"The 'Red Velvet Elvis' is like crack - coconut too - I like the little ones."}
{"text":"I love, love, love this cupcake and sweets shop! By far one of my favourite dessert shops in town. The store is always clean, neat and calm. The staff are always ready to help and answer any questions. I love the taste of the cupcakes and the freshness of the frosting every time. The only downside to this locations is that the closing hours are a little early sometimes. Otherwise love this place!"}
{"text":"Here's a convenient location to satisfy your cupcake craving! (Pun intended.) This Crave is located in the Crowfoot plaza so you can drop by for a movie, grab a meal, get your dessert, and shop for some sports apparel to work off those calories all in one go.  The cupcakes do sell out so try to go earlier. I went around 3pm on a Tuesday and everything was available but just an hour and a half later, only red velvet and the more expensive thanksgiving specials were left.   They have pumpkin pie, apple spice, and pumpkin spice cupcakes right now. Grab one before they're gone until next year!  Mmm, cinnamon nutmeg buttercream..."}
{"text":"Ah, who does not love Crave Cupcakes? The butter cream icing is splendid. I remember one time taking a good hour to finish off my cupcake because of how filling it was, then again another time I was pretty hungry and I downed it faster than I probably should have.  I remember seeing the price and thinking \"HOH!\" but in a way, it's justifiable. Yes, you could go to your local grocery store and buy half a dozen cupcakes there for half the price, but those cupcakes are likely to be a couple days old, are smaller, and don't have the same quality that Crave does.   The location is pretty good too, as a local business it is set up in an area full of lesser known, and, I believe, local businesses. Service has been pretty good to. Sometimes I wish it was open longer hours. I also wish that if you went later in the day that they had more variety.  I wonder... if they're baked fresh every morning, what happens to the cupcakes left over at night? Do staff members get to take it home? Hm, if so, I need to apply for a job!"}
{"text":"I wanted to get some special cupcakes for my boyfriend's birthday and someone told me to try crave. So I did and I ordered 6 cupcakes with writing on them and the writing cost extra. It didn't look nice at all and considering I paid for them to write on the cupcakes, I thought it would look nice and professional but it was something my little brother could've done. Please teach your employees how to write messages on the cupcakes so it looks the same as the site please. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with cupcakes and search them out in every city I go to. This place is by far the best I have ever had. The princess is the best of their standard flavours but if you hit the right month, the peanut butter icing on banana cupcake is to die for. Crave has ruined all other cupcakes for me"}
{"text":"This is one of the best cupcake places in town they are super sweet and rich in flavours worth every penny. I love the chocolate cupcake with vanilla bean icing , you can also get mini cupcakes if you want a less sugar which is nice. I love stopping by and grabbing one for the go cause it's a huge cupcake that can last you for an entire lunch hour. I love the fact that they cook it in house it's always nice knowing that they use quality ingredients and they are always presented so clean. Everyone should have a crave cupcake at least once!"}
{"text":"A little pricey but I can't deny it's worth every penny. The service is pretty good and the manager seems to pretty on the ball."}
{"text":"Fantastic  service and products! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Been to Crave many times over the years but this was my first visit to this location. I happened to be in the area and who can resist a cupcake or two?  Stopped in to purchase some to bring home, as well as a mini cupcake for me as an afternoon treat. Cute store. As soon as I walked in I was greeted and felt welcome. I purchased 3 cupcakes (red velvet, coconut and a carrot cake) and 1 mini cupcake to snack on for the car ride home. I hear all the time that people think they are expensive however I think there are worth the price. Not only are they pretty but they are so good too!  Great location, great variety and excellent customer service. Will be back again when I am in Aspen."}
{"text":"If you live in the far NW now you know that Crave is nearby!"}
{"text":"My Bad... They do have a slight deal if you buy 6's or 12's  Trust me, you'll want that many!!!"}
{"text":"\"Do you have\"  \"Yeah we have that here, we HAVE IT ALL\"  The Filipino tradition of pasalubong is both a blessing and curse. There is nothing like getting gifts from someone visiting but nothing like the stress of finding things to bring to your relatives, especially in a city like YVR where the things that grow on their sidewalk are the sort of things you'd have to dig deep in your wallet for at the farmer's market.  ZOUNDS!! (It's a real saying look it up)  But suddenly my cousin texted me  \"Bring me crave cupcakes.\"  SALVATION!  So I rushed over to Crave in willow park. For approx 40$ I got a variety of cupcakes. They had 13 flavours which made it awkward to have everything for a dozen, but it makes me want to come back. When I brought it to my host family, they somewhat overlooked it until the lil one decided to take a bite. Soon they all praised me for bringing them a cupcake that was \"so good it was like MAgIC\" and \"are so cute buts so tasty\" and the majority of this family were dudes.  My cousin on the other hand loved her dozen. Apparently you can freeze cupcakes and have them later as frozen threats?  I've only tried a total of 3 crave cupcakes. They were amazing and anything I ate afterwards tasted like barf (don't eat veggies after a crave cupcake) my favourite is the one with lime. Why not anymore? Because those are calorie beasts and what kind of visitor am I if I polished off the pasalubong I brought?  Answer: A terrible one.  Yelp's November Challenge 18/30"}
{"text":"Delicious but so expensive! Really.. like c'mon these bad boys better be worth it if you dare to buy a half a dozen. The deliciousness kinda ends in the late evening though as the cupcakes you buy at this time have been left out for most of the day and are kinda hard. But hey that's what food does if it's left on a shelf all day."}
{"text":"Is it sad that you go to a place so often that you know the names of all of their items?  My personal favorites dirty blond, vava vanilla and crave-o-licious the cup cake and the names.    I see myself enjoying a cupcake from crave every month. I work in an office where the team of ladies demand cupcakes for every monthly sales meeting. I'm not complaining not even a little. I would like to possible try some other items but its hard braking routine ."}
{"text":"I procrastinated a tiny bit on ordering my wife's birthday cake. Oops! I did a bit of Yelp research and decided from previous experience with Crave's delicious cupcakes and the fact that they actually have reasonable prices when comparing to other cakes shops to go ahead and buy the cake here. It was convenient to order online where you can visually see what cake or cupcakes you would like to order. The process was simple and they called in a few minutes to confirm my order. I was happy they could make one up as quick as they did. I chose their location in Aspen as I thought it would possibly be less busy. I can't say the same for the shopping area their shop is located in as it was crazy trying to find parking at noon on a Thursday. It was still convenient to be able to just show up and grab the cake and leave. Albeit, I added some cupcakes to my order when I got there. Mmmm!  Great service and great products! Their cookies look to die for...much like everything they make."}
{"text":"Had an emergency and had to cancel my daughters birthday party. Totally forgot about picking up cupcakes on the day as we were with family. I realised a week later and went in. They charged me $50 yet they didn't bother calling me when no one came to pick up the cupcakes, instead, they threw them out (no phone record of any call-although Sandra says they always call). I asked if I could have credit and Sandra said no, offering me a coupon instead. There was no understanding or bend. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE! Why lose customers, in the long run,? to save a few dollars in the moment?"}
{"text":"Surprising that I haven't yet written a review for Crave, I've certainly eaten enough of their cupcakes. Now that I think about it, I've only ever had them at office gatherings, parties and Canadian Blood Services. I've never actually had to seek them out.  But today I was out and about and got a hankering for a cupcake. Surprise! Crave was the first store that came to mind. I pulled out my trusty Yelp app and found that there was one nearby in Willow Park.  The interior surprised me a bit. I didn't expect it to be so... white. This seems to be a trend in cake and pastry shop decor. I guess that makes them trendy along with the entire cupcake craze? At any rate, it was 4 pm and this location was nearing the end of their cupcake stock for the day. Thankfully there were still 4 or 5 kinds to choose from. Even more thankfully, I discovered something I love even more than a cupcake. The Whoopie Pie. Not entirely cookie, and not entirely cupcake. It's two flat muffin tops with icing in the middle. And it's fiendishly delicious. I'll have a dozen of those please! Actually, I test drove one and opted for half a dozen mini cupcakes as well. That counts as self-control, right?"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! It's clean, friendly, efficient and they make delicious desserts!  I have visited both Crowfoot and Kensington locations but prefer Crowfoot since it's closer to home and easier to find parking.  Basically, the cupcakes are perfect in flavour and texture for my taste. It's not too spongy or airy like a birthday cake but not as dense as a loaf. Chocolate is my favourite with either their signature blue icing or the strawberry icing lovingly known as the princess cupcake. I've tried every flavour. Coconut, peanut butter and dark angel are my novelties but I'm a chocolate princess followed by crave-o-licious in that exact order!  They come in regular or mini sizes which make it perfect as a housewarming gift or hostess gift for any occasion. The icing is not too dense or hard and dry like commercial cupcakes. Some other cupcake places, the icing is too airy and I can't feel it in my mouth. Call me crazy but I'm not a fan of flavoured air/ hence no hookah and shisha or rice cakes for me thx!!!  Cookies are also yummy! Good crunchy exterior with a softer interior and minimal crumble. I prefer chewy over crunchy and the confetti sugar cookie is perfect with a cup of tea or coffee. They're large so splitting one is a good idea if you're counting calories! I've not tried the cake, pies or gluten free items and unable to comment on that aspect. I've no doubt they'll meet the same quality as the rest of their selection.   I've never had a bad experience here and you can pre-order for pickup by a certain date. They'll even host a cake decorating event.   I've tried Bliss and Buttercream shoppe but this is still my fave cupcake place.  Great job Crave!!!"}
{"text":"Oh Crave,  Why must you be so sweet and delicious? After a long day in the office, I was driving home when my tummy grumbled!! Not the normal grumble when it grumbles when your hungry for anything, but a different grumble....a craving for cupcake grumble!!  Immediately, I thought that I needed a cupcake! Instead of going straight home, I kept driving...I could taste the peanut butter cupcake.....now the strawberry one....now the red velvet, OH!!  Then! it starts raining..... oh great, this better be well worth it! -_-  Finally I arrive at Crave, the smell of the cupcakes and the look of them are amazing..they're so pretty!  Initially, I only wanted to get one cupcake, because if i get more that only means that I eat them all..  So I keep admiring the cupcakes and can't just choose one, so I get half a dozen.  (oh man, all the calories and sweet sweet goodness in my tummy) I chose the Peanut butter, Strawberry, Vanilla, Signature, Chocolate and Red Velvet.  I usually like getting the cupcake of the month but they were out, but I'm still happy!  While the lady was putting the ribbon on the container, we were chatting when she told me that they're opening another Crave in Saskatoon, Saskatwean.  COOL!  They're expanding their chain and it will be good for them!  Of course after I left, I couldn't wait til home so I indulged in the Red Velvet in the car.  People probably thought I was weird because I was stuffing my face with cupcake, pausing and MMMMMing.  All in all, Crave Cupcake is a very pleasant place to stop by when you're craving cupcakes or other sweets.  The reason for the 4/5 star is that the cake is up and down, there are days when they're moist, and days when they're dense.  The icing is always brilliant though! People think its too sweet, but too sweet is perfect for me! :)"}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with Crave!  There are 5 locations, but the location on 17th avenue is closing!  During the Christmas season, they're selling different squares and bars, you must try them all!  They all look so delicious.  Also, they do have raspberry icing, but they only put them in the whoopie pies!  Any Crave location will hit your sweet spot and then some!"}
{"text":"Review #26 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012  I love crave. I love Crave so much that although I can tell from every bite the high fat content of their cupcakes, I never stop myself from finishing one or two or three regular sized cakes while watching TV. My husband and I once ordered a dozen each and finished them in 3 days but we didn't mind cos they were so moist and just have that right amount of sweetness to them. Compared to Bliss, both their regular and bite sized cupcakes are bigger. I like their Willow Park location cos it's not too busy and they always have the cupcakes we like. I like crave-o-licious (super moist!!!), red velvet, and dirty blonde...and also the peppy pattie..alright just go to their menu and that's basically the list of cupcakes I like.:)"}
{"text":"Ohhh boy!  Crave makes some damn fine little cakes! They have a wide variety for sale and also they have a flavor of the month (this month is carrot cake)  but make sure you come early because they often run out of cupcakes by the end of the day.   I remember I first tried these cupcakes around 5 or so years ago. My oldest sister was getting married and she invited me to come to a \"cake\" tasting, of course I obliged and tagged along. I remember we went downtown and met up with a lady  (one of the sisters who started crave) and she talked about their story and how their mom was the inspiration and the source of some of the recipes for crave. Then we tried the cupcakes. \"CUPCAKES for a wedding?\" I thought that was weird, but I guess my sister fancied herself for being different so a tiered cupcake \"cake\" it was! After I tried them (it was the signature crave cupcake chocolate cake with their mind blowing vanilla buttercream icing) I was hooked, and commended my sister for her choice, I probably ate 3 at her wedding because the dinner was blah, but at least the crave cupcakes made up for it! hahaha  So anyhow I just adore this place! When they started expanding the locations and when I found out willow park was getting one I got so pumped!  These cakes pack a flavour punch! A lot of people say they put too much icing or that they are too rich (which I don't understand???) That is a BIG bonus in my mind, I cant get enough these.I have to be very careful....  5 years later I am still eating crave, in fact just yesterday I tried the carrot cake at a birthday, it was really moist and quite sweet. On friday I tried a red velvet elvis whoopie pie, it was amazing and made for a clean snack (no spilling or icing on my face)!  whoopies iz a reaaaddyyy!!   I honestly can say I have never had better cake than crave. My all time favorite is the Va va vanilla. Simple and so amazing, I have often wondered how I can get the recipe for that icing! Its so freakin good! I should just get a summer job and find out the recipe that way!  If you haven't tried their cupcakes then go A.S.A.P  And please don't complain that you got to much icing! just eat the stinkin thing and let the sugar rush kick in!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, great cupcakes and cookies. All I can say is even for a big guy like me these things are ultra filling. I could eat one before basically going into a food coma. The icing on these is thick and why people love them. I bought 6 for a birthday and it was pretty overkill for 2 people. I can't see anyone not loving these. I wish I took pictures but let's face it they didn't last long enough for that."}
{"text":"Sure, they are delicious, but who can ever get here early enough to ensure actually getting the flavor they want? I am partial to red velvet myself, but because of my scheduling, I rarely get to walk in here and get one of those heavenly cakes.  The price is largely negated by the size of the cupcakes, and the absolute flavor and heavy dose of sweetness contained within: one large cupcake and you are halfway to a diabetic coma. I think Man v. Food needs to do a segment where he tries to down six of them in 20 minutes. That would make for a fine show!"}
{"text":"While making a stop at David's Tea I decided to pop in here to grab a cupcake for my wife. There were a few people ahead of me but the staff had samples to offer while I waited. I've never been offered a sample at a Crave store before and I didn't know they had anything other than cupcakes.   I sampled the lemon squares which were quite excellent, but not enough so that I would sway from filling my belly with a red velvet cupcake. However, in the future I may be nudged to try something new to pair my tea with."}
{"text":"After never being able to get down to their 17th Ave location I'm glad they opened one up in the south.  If you haven't tried their cupcakes WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU??  If I hadn't resisted the urge to open the 1/2 dozen pack I bought before I got home they probably wouldn't have made it."}
{"text":"Nothing satisfies the sweet tooth like a crave cupcake....red velvet in particular....does anyone know even what red velvet actually is?...I mean what is in it? chocolate or just red :S....actually, come to think of it I'd rather be left mystified  about the best cupcake i've ever hard by far.  Theres quite a variety of different flavour's (second favourite is the princess) and the regular sizes are like $3.  But not to worry cuz they are pretty massive.  Getting through one can be a arduous yet delicious chore.  And getting through two will push you sweetness taste buds to the brink albeit a heavenly brink.  The setup is pretty sweet as well.  Its simplistic yet I always feel like i'm in a disney movie when i walk in.  Maybe its cause you get bambarded with all the different colors of frosting in a row.   easily one of the best desserts in town!"}
{"text":"They now offer Gluten Free cupcakes. They taste better than the original!"}
{"text":"Absolutely some of the best cupcakes I have ever had.  My first impression when I walked into my first Crave location (on 17th Ave) was \"DAAAANG! These are expensive!\"  I would now like to retract that initial reaction.  One cupcake is always MORE than enough, so I actually find the $2.95 price tag somewhat justified. Jessica and I can easily split one between us and be satisfied.  Crave's buttercream recipe takes the ... *ahem* ... cake. Easily the best frosting I've ever tasted. I heard it is a family recipe and now matter how hard I have tried, I have never been able to recreate a recipe nearly as good as theirs.  This location SHOULD have 5 stars although I vaguely remember an altercation with an extremely unhelpful and rude employee at one time. While this incident was probably a year or so ago, and I do not remember it that well, I remember at the time I intended to never come back to this particular location.  I have since then gotten over it, and have found the service to be decent ever since."}
{"text":"Thankful for choclate cupcakes with melt in your mouth blue cream cheese icing.  Favorite indulgence that always delivers!"}
