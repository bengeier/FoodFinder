{"text":"I went with a group of 2 other friends at 11pm and we ordered a cocktail each, as well as the green tea brick toast. The cocktail was good, and the brick toast was really good too. The only thing that stops me from giving it a five star review was that the waiter did not give us utensils until five minutes after our toast came (even though it wasn't too busy), and it took a long time for the food + drinks come."}
{"text":"Had the lunch special.  We ordered two meals pork chop and ramen and it took over half an hour to serve.  Once we did get it the rice was Luke warm and everything was way too salty. The drink that comes with the special was limited,  it's not the extensive menu.  The one plus is that service was attentive"}
{"text":"Very disappointed! service was really bad, waitress look like walking dead. No smiles and miserable don't know what they are doing. Messed up our order, food never came until we ask. Order a hot pot for $15.99 is Over priced! The quality and quantity does not worth that price."}
{"text":"The decor was nice, but the service and food sucked. Definitely not coming back again.

Ordered a salmon pasta with bacon and mushrooms. I only eat seafood so i asked with no bacon, and when the food came (40 minutes later), it came with a bunch of chicken pieces in it. They also forgot one of our orders and we had to wait another 20 minutes. The servers couldn't have cared more, one was just sitting down using his phone. Awful experience, and no compensation too. Honestly you can find another place that's way better, better portions, and better service."}
{"text":"Nth special, lots of varieties which is not always a good thing.. overpriced normal food"}
{"text":"Okay 1 star review, here we go.

\"Korean\" Style Chicken Wings. They were already small when they arrived but the actual size of the wing hidden inside the batter was laughable. I have never met a chicken wing where I didn't want to eat the skin until now. On top of this was the fact that they thought 4 pieces of batter was worth $9.

We tried to get the taiyaki and once again they didn't have it, so this is looking more like a bait and switch. I wouldn't be surprised if they just remove it from the menu soon. So we settled for the Matcha Red Bean Soup with Glutinous Rice Balls instead. Their menu designer went a little too heavy on the colour balance because comparing that to matcha soup in person was like night and day. We mentioned it to the server and they got the manager over to explain that some people prefer less matcha so that it tastes sweeter. They offered a replacement which had a bit more matcha powder on top but tasted the same to me

All in all, this was a 1 start visit. Previous visits were not quite as bad but you should definitely be careful with what you order because there is a pretty large inconsistency across the menu."}
{"text":"Went to this place with a group of friends. First of all, it is not a holiday today, but of course to make extra cash, they claim it a holiday for the 2nd half of December (ate here on Boxing Day). I got the Grilled Salmon & Salmon Roe BBQ Rice. It was average. Service was slow and inconsistent. In our group, we received all our food over the span of 20 minutes. 2 of us got our food first, then another 3, but our last friend received his food 15 minutes after the last 3 got their food. By that time, all of our food was already cold. When asking the waiter why my friend's food took so long, she said that that specific order just takes long... It would've been nice if she indicated that to us before we ordered it. 

The only reason this is not 1 star is because the Taiwanese popcorn chicken was really good. I recommend just getting that."}
{"text":"Went in expecting typical Chinese/Taiwanese \"snack\" foods and was pretty overwhelmed by the menu. They serve a fair amount of Japanese, Chinese, and even Korean-esque dishes. In my opinion, their menu is too diverse, their staff are not always hospitable, and service is a snail's pace. 

When I went with a friend, I ordered the chicken katsu that had a cheese centre as well as the ice cream taiyaki dessert. After receiving and processing my order in the POS system, the waitress informed me that they were out of stock of the taiyaki - which I was a bit saddened by, but it was fine. The food took over half an hour to arrive, and the dining area was not even filled to capacity. When the food finally arrived, I realized it was still raw (translucent, and very pink) in the middle. I waved to a waitress, who redirected my issue to someone whom I assume was the manager. He apologized and asked if I wanted to order something else \"in its stead\" to replace my raw meal. I selected another dish (a rice bowl) and the waiting game began again. When the bill arrived at the end of my meal (which took 20 minutes), I saw that they had charged me for both entree dishes, as well as the dessert that never arrived. Beyond frustrated at this point, I asked the waitress to summon the manager. He apologized and, another 20 minutes later, brought my table the bill with only the correct (and consumed) items. 

Overall taste of the food was very underwhelming. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Love the dishes here. have many variety and free drink if you post a photo on ur social media"}
{"text":"I went there for lunch, dinner and drink at late night.
my overall experience was good.
FOOD: 
the food is decent (a bit salty) and adventurous (not your typical Cantonese food..but they put some thought in the presentation). I had noodles, rice, chicken dish... all were good 

SERVICE: 
the service is very good . the servers tried to provide value add service by recommending food. 

TIP:  the place is busy, so don't expect to sit comfortably. it is a tipster place... seniors may find it noisy *smile*"}
{"text":"When my friends suggested a Taiwanese restaurant in First Markham Place, I really wasn't so thrilled since I felt the city lacked authentic Taiwanese eats. As I enter the restaurant, I noticed at least 15 customers waiting to be seated so I got a little more excited since it probably means the food is quite good.

We had a party of 10 including kids and waited for about 30 mins to be seated. The servers were super nice and helpful and our waters never ran dry and highchairs were offered immediately to help us settle in.

They have two different menus, on for food and other for dessert and drinks.  We ordered popcorn chicken, sesame chicken, beef noodles in clear broth, chicken cutlet with spaghetti, rice bowls with beef and 3 of us got the spicy mala individual hotpots. I had the hotpot (sorry, forgot photo) and it was amazing. A great variety of items and great spice level.

Everyone pretty much finished their meal so we ordered one dessert for the table. It was a massive toast tower with ice cream and chocolate chips and yummy creamy sauce at the bottom. The toast was sooooo crispy and each side was toasted perfectly.  

I can't wait to go back and try their other desserts and bubble teas!!!  Go try it!"}
{"text":"There's is too much hype around this place. 

The service is slow and sometimes the servers are rude. My guests and I are CBC's so even though we order in English, we can still speak Chinese. The servers shouldn't be talking sh*t around us, assuming we don't understand. 

Our food and drinks always take forever to come out. However, they do have a wide selection that we enjoy, which is why we keep coming back. 

The cheese tarts are expensive but it's worth it and I would suggest splitting it with the table or just having one and packing up the other. 

The popcorn chicken is great too, but you can never really go wrong with popcorn chicken. 

And they used to have free Wi-Fi, but took it away 

I would only come back if my friends insisted on it but I wouldn't go out of my way to dine here."}
{"text":"Came in here on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. Seated right away. We ordered the okonomiyaki fries, the grilled salmon and salmon roe rice, and the tomato beef noodle. Food was mediocre, but service was terrible. 

You get a free dessert (milk pudding) for posting a picture on social media. Towards the end of our meal we flagged down a waitress to ask for a dessert menu. I asked if they were still doing the promo for the free dessert with social media pic and they said yes and asked if we still wanted the dessert menu. I said no, we'll just have the free dessert then. I explained that I already posted a photo on social media so how do I redeem for the dessert. She said you just have to show the waitress your photo, and then she left without even looking at my photo. I thought she would be back to look at it, but when she disappeared for about 10 minutes I thought maybe she already put the order in for the dessert. After waiting another 20 minutes and not knowing where the server disappeared to, we realized we wouldn't be getting our dessert. Not a big deal, since it was supposed to be free anyway, but just annoying that we waited around for nothing. 

The only reason we checked this place out was because it was relatively empty. Had it been a wait to be seated we wouldn't have even bothered. The food is nothing to write home about. Don't think we will be coming back."}
{"text":"The food and drinks are excellent here. Not cheap but worth it.

The service is poor, one of the servers spilt water all over the table and over one of the entrees and there wasn't any acknowledgement or even an apology.

However, I'll keep coming back because I'm a slave to good food. This place has some pretty authentic Taiwanese food, def. cant lie bout that. Expect a wait, nights, weekends, doesn't matter. No one actually works in Markham, just eat out all day long."}
{"text":"Nice Decor, friendly staff, food tastes pretty good better than the other one at yonge/finch."}
{"text":"Before MABU opened in First Markham Place, I have been driving a long way for their fine Taiwanese food in North York.  In both stores, they have big hearts making quality unique Taiwanese food.  The restaurant staff in Markham are friendly and helpful.  Combined with the spacious seating arrangement, 

Based on my close friend's recommendation, today I tried this Japanese Style Glutinous Rice Balls & Brown Sugar Warabimochi Mix.  It is something I can't find anywhere else in Markham/Richmond Hill area.  The rice balls is freshly made chewy & soft, dipped in house special caramel.  The top half of brown sugar mochi is actually coffee flavoured.  The green tea mochi taste strong enough.  Japanese food is known to taste light & healthy, and this yummy item is made exactly the way it is supposed to taste like in Japan."}
{"text":"Super long wait if you don't make a reservation for dinner. The waitresses are not that attentive. The first time I went we ordered the house special pot they were very nice in switching the pot after they made a mistake by not removing one of the ingredients we asked to remove. It was very obvious though that they scooped the ingredient out from that pot and just returned it, the meat was already overcooked after and it came out looking very messy. There tomato pot is very delicious. Would not recommend their match and red mean mochi waffle as it was super sweet."}
{"text":"I have been here second time - Sunday 4pm - I ordered Mango Honey Toast $15.99 and Grill BBQ Chicken Rice $12.99, Chicken was really juicy and full of the sweet soy sauce, just liked a Japanese style.

Mango Honey Toast was not a toast, it's the brick toast and taste was good. It was a mix of mango flavor with cream and mango ice cream on the top. Finally, I could not finish this. 

It's a bit pricey for dessert.

You get 10% off for paying in cash."}
{"text":"Went there many many times, love their hot pot, rice noodles and deserts! Good services in general, reasonable priced."}
{"text":"Came on a saturday night and didn't have reservations.  Had to wait a long time even though there were tables (but reserved that were empty).  I could probably had finished my meal before that table arrived.  Overall, food was allright, atmosphere was nice.  

Food:
Huge menu for food, dessert and drinks.  I tried a variety of dishes: popcorn chicken, hot pot, tofu, egg wrap roll thing, pork belly rice don, sizzling beef rice and a free egg pudding dessert.    I would say that the variety is great but food taste was good for some but not all.  The fried stuff were good and the pork belly rice was okay.  The hot pot had lots of filing.  The sizzling beef rice was not worth it, very small pieces of meat, lots of rice.  Overall, it's a hit and miss.  

Atmosphere: 
Comfortable and trendy environment.  The rustic feel makes it very comforting.  However, seating is limited."}
{"text":"This is like a new generation of Taiwanese restaurants, bubble tea, food and alcohol all in one, how cool is that?

I've been to dozens of bubble tea places, either some of them serve good bubble teas but really bad food or it's the other way around.  I have been looking for a place that serves both good food and bubble teas and I think I found it.  Actually Go 4 Tea is not too bad, this place is like Go4Tea but they serve alcohol.

I think one of their most popular items is the single person hotpot, I tried the one that comes with Tom Yum soup and I absolutely hated it I think it's just me, I just didn't like the soup at all, not the same Tom Yum soup I've had before but my wife found it to be ok.  Their chicken(san-bei chicken) on rice was really good!

I've been to this place twice and have tried their other food items and overall I'm happy with this place, would definitely return and try other of their many menu choices.  I really have to say though their service was slow, it took 5 minutes for us to actually find a server and put our order through.  

One important note, this is not a place where you hang out for 3-4 hours and play cards, it's a restaurant rather than a cafe and I believe they have 2 hour seating limit."}
{"text":"Menu is HUGE.  They offer everything from Taiwanese/Japanese snacks, noodles, hot teppan rice plates, hotpot, to an extensive dessert and drinks menu.  It's the sister restaurant to Mabu Station on Yonge/Finch and they even have the menu for that other restaurant here for some reason.  

The hot teppan plate is very similar to the Aka Teppan next door, but not as good since my plate wasn't sizzling.  it also wasn't too tasty as the sauce was a bit bland.  

The mini-hotpot though, I thought was very good.  I had the milk & cheese broth and that made the soup base very tasty.  It had a generous portion of seafood and veggies, and it was enough for a hungry person to eat solo or shared.  

Overall, this is a nice place whether you're going for a savory meal, or for desserts with friends.  The menu is extensive enough (maybe a bit too overwhelming) that it should cater to any hungry patron."}
{"text":"Pros: 
*decor and food are aesthetically pleasing
* Huge menu 
Cons: 
*overpriced for its quality 
*service was terrible. Most waitresses don't understand English. 
*I feel scammed (read below for the reason) 

The waitress gave us the option for the dessert to arrive at a set amount of time but her explanation did not explain if it starts at the time the food is ordered or after the main course is served. She suggested 20 minutes but my friend and I thought that was not enough time so she has changed it to 25 mins instead. Once our food arrived 10-15 mins after ordering, we were asked to move to another table because the place was packed. When we were still in the middle of eating the main course, the waitress brought the dessert out. I have asked her if she could placed it back in the fridge since we just started eating not long ago. She was arguing with us since the order said serve in 25 mins but we both thought it was after the main course is served. She ended up putting it back to the fridge . I have ordered a pepper sauce pork cutlet spaghetti on grilled plate and my friend ordered a pepper sauce beef cutlet rice on grilled plate. Both of us felt that there were too much pepper. We both tried to finish it since it was 12.99 per plate but it was almost humanly impossible. My throat and esophagus were burning at the end. When we told them we were ready for dessert, the green tea cheesecake was super dry and unlike the picture in the menu. I understand if mcdonald burgers don't appear the same from menu in real life but I honestly expected more from this place. In the picture (top), you can see that the cake is made out of 1/2 cheesecake filling and 1/2 green tea filling. However, what we got (bottom 2 picture) was a 1/4 cheesecake and 1/4 green tea filling. The other half was made out of a typical but DRY sponge cake. For 12.99 I have expected more. I can barely even taste the matcha. We asked the waitress why the cake was so different than the menu and she did not give us a proper explanation. She said \"There are cheesecake and green tea filling. It's right there\". Her boss quickly came by and asked her what's wrong. I can hear their conversation since they are standing behind me but they did not offer any solution. Not even an apology. I will definitely not come back to this place again due to its poor service and overpriced food."}
{"text":"Had the most horrible experience here. The serve broke a glass. Pieces of glasses flew everywhere. It feel on my head and hit my leg. She didn't bother to care, give me tissue and just pick up glasses on the floor. She didn't even ask \"are you okay\". Then I just didn't bother to eat my food, just incase there's pieces of glasses. I couldn't believe this. Also, food is just normal and the price is a bit too high for these food."}
{"text":"The decor of this place is much more trendy than most other Mabu stations. 

We came here at 1am and there were still quiet a few people eating. They serve both hot dishes and desserts. 

We ordered the signature cheese cake and cheese tart. The cheese cake was delightful! So light and fluffy when eating with ice cream. The inside of the cheese tart was runny with a crunchy outside. Both desserts were delicious ! However, the price point is rather high. We ended up paying $30 for both."}
{"text":"We saw this place a while back and thought this would be perfect for CNY, so we went and called in for a reservation.  Take note there are no reservations available on weekends,  so dibs on whoever gets there first. We arrived around 5 pm and the place was empty. Fast forward to one hour later-the place was packed!  Go early on the weekends to not end up hangry and waiting.  Weekdays reservations are OK
Now we were with a group that has hearing difficulties,  and the music was blasting 
 Appreciate the staff for turning it down a bit, it was difficult to hold conversation.  
Extensive menu here, took us quite a while to order anything.  go with the chef recommendations, they do taste great!  Since we were early we got our foood relatively fast.
Things we got to share:
Beef tongue-portion size could be bigger,  but the slices were incredibly thin and tender so that made up for it
Sesame chicken appetizer - a bowl of sesame broth and chicken we used the soup to season our rice as well,  pretty good size- same as the mini hotpot
Beef noodles- noodles were fresh tasting and the beef was soft as well,  extremely big for one person and just- right for 2 people 
Pork miso hotpot-came with some seafood and was absolutely delicious,  not too heavy on the stomach and cooked pretty fast
Taiwanese popcorn chicken- no contest Here this was finished minutes after it was put on the table. Tender chicken with a crisp outside 
Oyster omelette -I liked how this dish came out, some parts crispy and some parts tender with a whole lot of oysters. this was a tad bit underdone for me and as I'm pretty sensitive to oysters not well done but it is all good so far. No stomach symptoms!
Honey toast tower- my brother got to choose the dessert for the night as it was his birthday celebration as well. This glorious toast came precut in smaller bite sized toast pieces which we appreciated as everyone is looking for manageable bites. Someone mentioned the custard was like mortar for the toast that looked like bricks all smothered in a cream sauce

We made my brother happy and celebrated CNY!  2 birds with one stone indeed!"}
{"text":"Mabu is a great little spot for Taiwanese food and desserts. The first time I came here, I had impeccable service, our water was always refilled and our food arrived early without any delay. I ordered the \"individual\" size hot pot, which probably could feed 2-3 people. About a week later I returned and service was not the same. It took a while to get the food and get the waiters attention to get some hot tea, since they seated us right by the doors in -20 weather. I will be returning, since I really enjoy the atmosphere and the food. It would be helpful if service became consistent."}
{"text":"Lots of selection..Mostly Taiwanese foods..Ranging from hot pots.. dessert ...Cocktail and Taiwanese drinks"}
{"text":"Mabu Generation is way too overhyped for no good reason whatsoever...it seems to be always busy but their service is not good, the food is even worse and way overpriced. It is full of MSG and way too salty (hot sizzling plates) and the salmon and fish roe is extremely not fresh to the point where you can taste it. The drinks and desserts are way too sweet and for an 8.99 apple aloe drink that's supposed to be fresh, it tasted like concentrated apple juice with aloe pulp. 
They made us wait when we were next in line and there were two empty tables (they don't take reservations so they weren't reserved). Apparently  they just do this because it happened before to my mom as well when she went. On top of that, the high chair seat belts are all broken. 
I don't understand the hype about this place, definitely not worth my money and probably never coming back. I will give credit to their popcorn chicken though, it was good but not the best."}
{"text":"Really bad service!
Not recommended at all!
Food was not fresh and taste terrible!
Not coming back here!"}
{"text":"Granted, this place is pricey for what you're getting, the food tasted better than expected.

Their mini hotpot seems to be a favorite among the patrons and for $16.99, my pot was mostly cabbage instead of other ingredients.. 

Their popcorn chicken ($8.99) was pretty good, with the right amount of crispness and tenderness inside. 

Service was spotty, it was hard to even get the bill. 

On the plus side, they offer 10% off if you are paying with cash. 

I'll be back to try their dessert selections!"}
{"text":"Went back again to try their dessert menu, and had an amazing experience! We waited about 30 minutes to get a table but it was all worth it for their famous toast mountain! Delightful...truly delightful! Huge portion for a decent price and SOOO DELICIOUS, I devoured it in 5 minutes!! Service was pretty good as well and they will warn you about the wait time for food since it's always so busy."}
{"text":"EXTREMELY DISSAPOINTED! stay clear of this place. Dark, overstaffed, bad service, poorly managed and over-priced for the quality. 

Decided to try this place on on a busy Saturday lunch there was no wait when we got there but it quickly started getting packed. They seemed to be overstaffed with around 6-8 ppl however horribly mismanaged and uncoordinated. Ordered a Taro Slush, they made a Taro Milk tea instead. Decided to try the Takoyaki, A rice dish and Noodle dish between the two of us. The takoyaki never came and when I got the bill and explained the problem they tried to send over an okinamiyaki when I was in midst of paying for the bill and charge me for the additional taro milk tea that was never ordered. Luckily they gave me a 10% discount (which they give at the other location if you pay cash regardless)...When I went to pay for the bill the supervor had the audacity to tell me \"Sorry I thought you guys read chinese...\" as a response for messing up the orders so badly perhaps. I will never go back and cannot recommend."}
{"text":"Great service and good food! Ordered a golden toast dessert - highly recommended!!!

Very busy so be prepared for a wait on the weekend. 

The restaurant is super busy, so they will want to turn over their tables quickly."}
{"text":"Extremely long line up!!!!! 
Food quality are quite random, 80% of the time it was great and speedy but sometime just sometime it tasted really bad with the food not even warm enough. 
Price is fair.   I do recommend try your best to avoid busy hours which is from 7:30pm until they close."}
{"text":"Atmosphere over food quality, but service is good and choices are plentiful. They have a really great dessert menu which is a plus"}
{"text":"I usually don't write reviews,but this still bothered me the next day.  I ordered the okonomiyaki fries and noticed that there was a hair on one of the fries so we advised the server and she gladly took it back to give us a new one.  However, when we got it back, we noticed that the fries were not hot.  I'm not the type of person that sends food back, let alone send it back twice, so we just ate it with the lingering thought that there was hair in our food.  When we asked for the bill another server/manager (not sure what her position was) asked us if we got a new plate of fries. I told her that when we got it back it was not hot so we thought maybe it was the same one we originally got.  She said she would go to the kitchen to ask and when she came back she said that she didn't get a definitive answer from them. Obviously with this answer we knew that the plate of fries was not new. I will say that she handled it nicely. She apologized and offered us a free dessert (any of our choosing). However, knowing how unsanitary this restaurant was we passed on the dessert and just asked the fries to be taken off the bill.  I wrote this review because I wanted to give everyone a warning. Go at your discretion."}
{"text":"Parking sucks in this plaza. Food was pretty good apart from the cheese cake. I wouldn't recommend the matcha cheese cake it was strange. The spaghetti and chicken cutlet was good, huggge cutlet. I've had the raindrop cake and it was delicious but not worth 10$
There's only one tv and if you're not sitting near the windows this pillar is going to block the tv and you won't be able to watch the game."}
{"text":"Arrived around 7:15pm and had to wait for about 30 minutes for a table for 2 on Saturday evening.

Food: 3/5
We shared the Spicy Beef Hot Pot (H12 - $16.99) and Grilled Angus Beef Steak Don (G01 - $12.99). 
Spicy Beef Hot Pot - Hot pot didn't have a lot of meat in it and was mostly packed with veggies. The base was pretty spicy which I liked and also came with chili oil on the side. The instant noodles that came with it was served separately (so you add it in when you're ready since there's not much room in the pot when you first get it) - but it was only half a serving of instant noodles. 
Grilled Angus Beef Steak Don - came with a pretty raw poached egg which went well with the rice and beef, overall a good dish. 

You can also post a photo on social media (like Yelp) and get a free dessert (House Special Milk Pudding) or drink. We got the dessert, I liked it!

Food was good overall but a bit expensive. 

Service: 3/5
Waitress was helpful for the most part and was mostly attentive in our requests and filling up our glasses. The waitress wasn't too helpful or talkative - apparently you get 10% off if you pay cash, but she didn't tell us. 

Cool spot with a trendy setting that was probably one of the more crowded places at FMP."}
{"text":"Their menu is a little bit too much but my friends and I tried their Signature Personal Hot Pot today.  We give them 5/5 stars.  Price is a bit on the higher side ($15.99 - 16.99) but the portion is good and the service is excellent.  They are quite busy right now during dinner time.  $15-16 is not that pricey considering most Italian restaurants charge about that for their dinner courses.

I got:  Japanese Milk and Cheese Seafood Hot Pot (very good)

My brother got:  Taiwanese Spicy Hot Pot (good flavor and you can order less spicy)

My friend got:  Taiwanese Sour Pork Hot Pot (he loves it)

The manager gave us two Signature Cocktail because she told us about this new location when we went to Mabu on Yonge street.  She was impressed that we remember that conversation.  The Cocktail is quite good too (Beer + White Grape and Peach and Lichee + Lemon).  Not sure how much they cost though.  She actually gave us the real portion and not the \"sample size\".  We were amazed by that.  

I have tried their hot plate.  I was not too impressed because the portion is a bit too small.  I give them 5 Star for their Hot Pot.  They make their own dipping sauce too.  

PS:  I love Mabu's decoration.  Quite trendy."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times for dinner and it was my first time here today for their lunch meals. I always enjoy coming here for their wide selections of food. 

My friend and I ordered their lunch combos ($11.99) today which includes a bubble tea drink and dessert as well. For bubble tea options, you get either regular milk bubble tea or regular green tea flavour. Any other flavours will be additional charge. I ordered the popcorn chicken meal and my friend ordered the chicken basil. The dishes came with rice and some veggies on the side; both were very flavourful. Dessert that came with the meal was some kind of milk pudding, honestly not sure what it was but it didn't taste really good. We didn't end up finishing the dessert but overall, we both felt that it was a pretty decent value meal. 

Service was friendly and warm. We arrived at noon and didn't leave until 3pm. I liked how they explain their menu and showed us how to write our order on the piece of paper provided. They didn't rush us to get out and instead they keep coming around to refill our glass of water. 

If you are in the area, I highly recommend to try MABU as they have many selections to choose from especially when you don't really know what you feel like eating."}
{"text":"2.5 stars

After seeing this place open for so long, I finally had a chance to try them. I tried to call in for reservation but they don't take reservations on weekends. We came early at 6pm and they had a few tables available. Shortly after, it was very packed and lots of people were lining up.

I ordered popcorn chicken and the Salmon, Bacon Udon. The popcorn chicken was good and I liked the spicy mayo sauce on the side. But i've had better popcorn chicken. The udon was very meh. Nothing special, not really good. 

As for their desserts, I tried the Warabimochi and Hokkaido Molten Cream Cheese Tart. Both were really good. The Warabimochi was very interesting. Yummy. Texture was like grass jelly. But soft and slightly chewy. The matcha flavour was much better than the brown sugar. 

Although all their staff appeared nice, wow they are so annoying. Very attentive, kept coming back to pour us water which was very good. But as they started to get really busy and lots of customers waiting, a server would come all the way to our table, glance at our table and just walk away. Every 2 minutes or less. How. Annoying. We were still eating, enjoying our dessert and waiting for another dessert to come. Ridiculous how they kept coming over like that. At least make it less obvious? 

Also, when we arrived it was still sunny out and we purposely asked for a window seat so we could take photos. A server came by and asked us to close the blinds for her. I told her that it's okay, I wanted them open. And she tells me that customers want it closed. Okay, what about us, are we not also customers? It isn't a big deal, but such poor choice of words.."}
{"text":"Never had the chance to try Mabu in the past because of the long lineup, but when we went at around 11PM on a weekend we only waited around 20 minutes. The service here is on point and there is a wide selection of fusion foods along with unique drinks and desserts. The sweet and spicy thai chicken wings were perfect, although they served it after our main dishes arrived. I would definitely recommend trying the hotpot here, we had the sukiyaki hotpot and the broth + everything inside was amazing. The basil chicken hot plate with rice was also great, probably the most flavourful basil chicken I've had in comparison to other Taiwanese restaurants in Markham. You also get a 10% discount while paying with cash so the pricing isn't bad at all. Overall a very intimate atmosphere and pleasant service with great food, just wish the lines were shorter. Will definitely come back in the future!"}
{"text":"Cute place, waited for 30 min for a table of 8. The food smelled really good and they had a wide variety of drinks. My friend got the Oreo drink and it looked really good"}
{"text":"Decent food and service the first time I came. When I visited this place the second time, I got pretty upset about the fact how those staffs reserved booths for their friends and squeeze people in smaller tables. Plus the waffle ice cream I ordered was sticky (undercooked?). I'll stay with Sugar Marmalade from now on."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to try this resto! Seeing all the pictures and looking at the menu made me wanna try everything! And the place seems so busy all the time so I knew I had to try it!

I was sadly slightly disappointed  I was looking forward to such a good meal, which turned into an ordinary \"ok\" meal. 

When it was finally time to choose what I wanted to eat, nothing really stood out to me but I figured I should try something I wouldn't normally get. Soooo I got a mini hot pot (I only eat hot pot when it's buffet style). I got the Korean style hot pot with a variety of seafood, napa cabbage, luncheon meat and ramen. It was good but definitely looked better than it tasted. 

For dessert I got the matcha cheesecake (I'm obsessed with matcha so of course I had to try it). It looked so good seeing it at everyone else's table. Aaaaand again, it looked better than it tasted. It was good but not as creamy as it had expected. 

BUT I did like their Taiwanese style popcorn chicken and grass jelly bowls! The chicken was crispy on the outside, hot/juicy on the inside and had great flavour! The grass jelly bowl was a big portion that had lots of toppings. What made it even better was the coconut milk!

Would I come back? Probably 

But I'd rather try other places in the area first before going back."}
{"text":"Very good experience here! I love the different Taiwanese snacks and desserts they have here. I'm absolutely addicted to this place! We got the fried tofu and Taiwanese sausages and also the awesome hot plate (look at the pics). Definitely come try this place out, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Came for a night snack after badminton at about 10-ish. It took about 30 minutes line up for a group of 13 people. Most of the snacks look nice but I felt that they are over price. Such as a Japanese Style Fries cost about $10 with tax. They looked like regular French fries with seaweed, mayonnaise and Tonkatsu sauce on them which seems have no complication in making them. The menu said that this order would require 20 minutes wait time. I would say the quality doesn't match the price. ."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is fairly large with lots of booth and table seating. It's VERY busy and the waiting area is quite cramped. One star on the review is purely because they have a huge menu. There is a menu for drinks and desserts and another for entree. Despite MABU being a dessert place (I hadn't actually known this) there are many good options including small personal hotpot and hot sizzling rice plate. 

It's a bit pricey for the portions given: $16.99+ for a personal hotpot with only hot sauce on the side and no noodles or rice (it does come with clear vermicelli noodles which are not filling). It's of note that the menu pictures do not look like what comes to your table. Both items we ordered did not look like the picture, but thankfully they taste OK.  The average quality of food is accompanied by pretty attentive waiters - something that's hard to come by in a busy asian restaurant.

The decor is unexpected - rustic wooden tables and a fancy lit bar on the side.  There's a wall painting of Jiufen on one end which adds a nice touch."}
{"text":"Been here for a few times already, I love their food selection.This place can get very busy at night, if you don't want to line up then better come before 6pm."}
{"text":"Came on a late night weekday, and the place was packed with lineup. Wanted to try the dessert, quick observation shows people were more interested in personal hot pot.

Had a Hokkaido custard tart, and a maple syrup chicken and waffle combo. Both seems to be popular choice under `dessert` (even I did a double take)

Both my companion and I loved the dessert tart. Will definitely come back for it!"}
{"text":"Pretty busy on a Friday night, but a lot of tables left around 9:45 and it was only about a 15 min wait for 2.

Green Tea Toast Mountain was good, and the red bean was tasty.  The green tea cream on the dessert could be colder, but overall a good dessert that can feed 4 to 6.

Garlic fried tofu was very yummy! Nice big cubes of tofu in a tasty sauce, $7.99.

Have also tried their lunch before on a seperate occassion, popcorn chicken with waffle was ok.

The hotpot and sizzling rice looked pretty good, will come back to try those next time.  I wonder if they can substitute the instant noodle with vermicelli?"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and the food always seems to be a hit or miss. Their menu is super long with a variety of Taiwanese, Chinese, Japanese and Korean options. 

I find that majority of their drinks don't taste good with the exception of their rose milk oolong tea ($4.99), which I find is often sold out when I try to order it. I've tried a variety of their appetizers (takoyaki fries, popcorn chicken, chicken wings etc.) I found their takoyaki fries to be the most worth it. You get a huge place of fries for $7.99 - definitely a sharing plate. 

All their food seems to be way too salty. I always feel the need to water it down but the water they give you has lemon in it. Their beef noodle soup especially was ridiculously salty. Out of their hotpots, I find the only one really worth getting is the seafood milky hotpot. It's more unique and really delicious. I find that the other hotpots are too salty and not worth the $16.99-17.99 for the amount of food they give you. 

Also, for their hotpots, they give you half a square of instant noodles and it costs $1.99 extra to get the other half which seems a little ridiculous for what you're getting.

Lastly the service here is terrible every time I come. The waiters and waitresses never notice you and I find that they aren't even looking. They usually just talk to each other or look anywhere but the tables. They also aren't great at following requests; they would mark down on the receipt to take out an item from their hotpot, but the item would still show up when the food arrives. 

I wouldn't say this is my favourite spot to go to, but I appreciate the variety they have. Their milky hotpot is what brings be back everytime."}
{"text":"line up is really long (but to be fair it wasnt really the restaurant's fault) people would just stay there and talk looooooong after they finished eating... However the food came quickly and was pretty good in decent sized portions"}
{"text":"I like how this place open till really late, which is goos since many restaurants close at 11pm or earlier.  The customer service is pretty good so far consider I have been there for a few times already and they do give you enough attention. One time they gave me a wrong order ( I probably didn't write clearly) but they immediately change it for me and told me it's okay and without giving me any attitude. 

The food are decent overall.  The popcorn chicken is not bad and give good portion.  I tried their beef noodle but not very impressed as it tastes regular to me.  I also tried one of their beef sizzling plate (forgot the name)  and I don't like it either. So far I think their fried food items are good.  Will try some other dishes and see how they'd turn out."}
{"text":"My friends and I visited this place after an afternoon of skating. We were really craving for some dessert. We ordered:
- soybean tiramisu 
- hot grass jelly with a variety of beans  glutinous balls served with grass jelly juice 
- mochi waffles with green tea ice cream and green tea pudding 
- milk pudding (free with a post of their food on social media) 

The tiramisu was good but a little too sweet for my taste. However, the flavour was good and texture was very creamy and smooth. There is no soybean flavour but a very rich creamy flavour. 
The grass jelly was our favourite. The grass jelly was served in a separate bowl, piping hot and the variety of beans and glutinous balls on a plate. This was not very sweet at all and had a very intense grass jelly flavour. The beans were nice and soft and cooked to perfection.  
The waffle was different. The waffle had little bits of mochi incorporated into the batter. And topped with a big scoop of macha ice cream and squares of green tea pudding. The waffle was very fluffy and I loved the occasional chew of mochi. 
Milk pudding was pretty standard but I also enjoyed that it wasn't too sweet. And a generous serving considering it was free! 

The ambience of this place was great. It's a nice place to sit around and catch up with friends and not feel rushed. Good service and very polite. Also if you pay cash, you get 10% off your bill. great bonus 

Haven't tried their savoury foods but from looking around, it looks good too! Their menu is quite large so expect some time to go through it when you get there."}
{"text":"Ridiculously understaffed and stupid wait times. Not sure why there's such a big hype over this place. The food was alright. The price is way too steep for what they offer. Nothing special enough for me to come back. It's just like any other Taiwanese bbt place, except with a lot more dishes on their menu. Their desert looks so good on the menu but when we ordered it, you can tell it's low quality with ingredients you can buy in the grocery and make yourself at home. One memorable dish we ordered was the matcha tiramisu and it was the weirdest desert we had. Basically a pile of broken up lady fingers/sponge cake (it wasn't even an actual slice of cake) with a LOT of cream on top sprinkled with matcha powder. Apparently that was \"matcha tiramisu\". The most decent thing we had here was the cheese tarts and the Taiwanese soysauce chicken."}
{"text":"This is a cute place to go to when you're just not feeling the usual coffee night routine. We were a group of 6 and it took a while for us to get a table. Otherwise the food was delicious, I had the beef and chicken house rice bowl. The portions are generous. For dessert I had the rose oolong tea and the green tea matcha cheesecake, it was good.. but not as good as the matcha honey toast tower. Definitely coming back for one of those!"}
{"text":"Mabu Generation bills itself as a Taiwanese izakaya. Izakayas, for the uninitiated, are traditional Japanese pubs where people go for shareable plates of food and drinks surrounded by pure raucousness. While Mabu Generation's menu certainly covers a wide variety of food options, the overall impression it leaves is a quiet whimper rather than the boisterousness I've come to expect of North America's izakayas.

I ordered the Roasted Chicken Cutlet with Cheese on Spaghetti, which came out supremely average. The quality would be your typical Cha Chan Tang (HK style restaurant) level, which is fine in and of itself; I could eat microwaveable spaghetti and enjoy the hell out of it. The problem is that said baked spaghetti at a CCT would cost me ~7 bucks, a microwaveable pasta dish ~2. Dish number S02 cost me $14!'

And that, I think, is the biggest issue with Mabu Generation. To compare yourself to something else is to set a standard by which you will now be judged. Mabu does not come close to reaching what establishments such as Kinka or Kingyo have done. The service is average and what you would expect of Chinese restaurants (don't expect service with a smile). The prices are high but the food undeserving.

I did not opt for dessert and I did not opt for a drink. I've seen some impressive looking pictures of dessert, so maybe that's one of their strengths, and not being a dessert person, I am barking up the wrong tree here. I may also return in the future if someone asks to go so as to sample some food items more traditionally Taiwanese such as the popcorn chicken. But as far as first impressions go, this was far from impressive.

{"text":"Just went here today! Was able to get a table right around noon time. It slowly picked up shortly after. Would recommend to come earlier to ensure you don't have to wait.

The atmosphere was very social. Up to date Asian music in the background. The waitresses were very attentive and took our order right away. We received our orders within a short amount of time. I ordered a sizzling hot plate with beef! It was very tasty. My sister ordered the sizzling hot plate with peppercorn pork-chop, however it was very peppercorn taste and would not recommend if you do not like it strong. 

The bubble tea was okay. I ordered the roasted milk oolong tea but it was nothing special. Overall the meal was decent but would definitely visit again just to try other items on their very wide selection menu."}
{"text":"This is a review for the dessert menu. Came here around 4pm on a Saturday. There were plenty of tables open so we got seated immediately. The decor was pretty modern and hipster. They had hiphop blasting through the speakers, so I guess it's a decent place to hang out, if the food was better.

Service was nice and quick. Our food got delivered within a minute of ordering so that's definitely a plus.

Unfortunately the dessert wasn't very good. I got the mango sago pudding and the egg milk pudding. The mango sago pudding was ok. The portions were pretty generous and the fruit jelly (lychee jelly mostly) gave it a nice punch. On the other hand, there was very very very little sago, and it was way too sweet. I felt a little sick afterwards.

The milk egg pudding was just awful. The pudding was hard and had zero taste to it. The only taste came from the syrup that's added on top. 10/10 would not recommend. Not worth the $7 we paid for it.

Would've given this place 2 stars but the price of the desserts were sky high. The cheapest things were $7 and for the more complicated desserts they immediately shot up to around $13. Not worth it for the low quality of desserts here."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and finally got the chance to review. 

Interior is really nice (modern, hipster) and with a dark (yet warm) lightning. They do have large seatings, but it's usually packed during lunch/dinner hours. Good thing they open till 2am for any late night smackers. Service is also good, waitress tries to be as informative and well mannered as they can while under a hectic, busy environment. 

Tried lunch and dinner here. They have a lunch menu so it's a bit more convenient and worthy of the price. 

Lunch sets include standard Taiwanese sausage rice or minced meat rice or black pepper sauce pork chop rice. It's a good fusion and comfort food feeling of Taiwanese and Japanese style cuisine. And price worthy for an included bubble tea!

Dinner specials include their Japanese theme hot pot (mixed with some Taiwanese style food) or stone pot rice. The hot pot is good for sharing and enough to feed 2 people. I enjoyed the sukiyaki and the milk cheese (the best). 

Overall it's a nice place to grab a quick meal or hang out with a few friends. They do offer just drinks and desserts (but haven't tried so can't comment much)."}
{"text":"I'm usually more positive than the masses. When I see a newish spot on absolute picture and review fire and then a lower than expected average rating, I can 'usually' find an extra bit of good to be just one star more positive than the rest. 

Today I stopped in for lunch at Mabu Generation and I gotta day, that this time the people have got it right. There were equal portions of good being balanced out by the not so great  to land this spot in the land of A-OK. 

Let's start with the good:
- whoa. I'm in love with whomever designed this place they merged vintage Taiwanese pop culture with an excessive industrial design vibe typically reserved for the Queen Street West's and Ossington  Avenues of the world. 

- Food. The lunch special I ordered was a sweet and sour style stir fried chicken, similar to a General Tso Chicken except with more of a hoisin/soy based sauce. I really enjoyed this option as it came with a mountain of rice, something that resembled plain pickled cabbage without the kimchi spices and some random rubber powered blob in a dish

- free dessert or green milk tea or green tea bubble tea with the purchase of your lunch special. Very much appreciated and pretty good. No choice in flavours but what was served was nice all the same and refreshing. 

Not so good: 
- Service. Really non existent. Similar to AYCE sushi you are left to your own devices with little direction, attention or suggestions. Basically have to fend for yourself until you waive your order sheet in the air

- Menu(s). Yes plural. When they dropped them off at my table I thought I had purchased the entire encyclopedia Brittanica **.  My criticism here is that I believe they offer too many menu items. Offer maybe the top 5 of each category and pair that menu down so servers can service it and the kitchen can execute it perfectly. 

- Food I think the beef ball with cheese appetizer might actually be a Kraft single melted on the balls. And the balls tasted like... balls (not that I know what that tastes like but like that level of bad). Spongy, with hard bits in the middle


Overall, I think I'd come back to give them a second chance. You'd have to with that extensive menu. Lots to work on still for a place with this many reviews. 

Eatcrest Out. 

** For you millenials and younger kids wondering \"what the fuck is a Encyclopedia Brittanica\". Well junior, before there was Wikipedia, nay, the internet, you used to have to buy all your facts in an alphabetical anthology of oversized books to find out what a labradoodle was."}
{"text":"Ordered the popcorn chicken appetizer, black pepper and teriyaki sauce with chicken and rice hot plate, and salmon, bacon, mushroom with cheese and cream sauce on spaghetti. The black pepper sizzling hot plate was very very spice. The food came quite quickly and the server we had was super nice. Tried to come here a few times before but wait time was too long (30+ mins) so we left. It gets really busy on weekends, especially around dinner time so I suggest you come on a weekday evening or afternoon on the weekends to avoid long wait times. The food and the menu was just regular; nothing too special. They only take reservations on weekdays, and they do not have public wifi."}
{"text":"Can't decide what to eat Saturday afternoon, drove by First Markham place, and found a newly opened restaurant, Mabu Generation!
          The place is well decorated, and the food is great! Service is also excellent (although we came at not so busy time), when we left around 5:45, the place is almost full with the capacity of close to a hundred people! 
           I had the traditional Taiwanese beef noodle soup, my family had the Taiwanese popcorn chicken rice, teriyaki black pepper & garlic rice, and personal Taiwanese spicy hot pot! All the meals were great! With so much variety, everyone is sure to find something to their liking here! I would definitely drop by again next time!!"}
{"text":"The description I received is \"a bit of everything, just give it a try\" and \"your parents probably won't like it much\". We've been trying to get in and try a few times over the past months but every time it's been packed - on weekdays and weekends! I thought, definitely because this place is great! Right?? Décor is a bit hip, and noise level is quite loud with the open concept and bar along the back - the blender is practically always running.

I finally came for dinner on a Friday - we got in right at 6pm and I was plain lucky in getting a table - a whole troop of patrons came in right after me and were left waiting. As soon as we were seated we were told seating time was limited to 1.5 hours - not bad, and I definitely understood - their menu made for some potentially long visits and their late night hours could encourage people to make it their go-to hangout spot for the evening. The menu features many Taiwanese options - everything I've heard of and some things brand new to me. There were also Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and fusion inspired dishes available. Desserts and drinks were also their own full menus - so plenty of options for everyone.

I went with classic Taiwanese squid balls, okonomiyaki, garlic stir fry greens, classic beef noodles, house rice noodles, and a chicken and egg crispy pan fried roll. The squid balls looked promising, but after the initial heat disappeared we found them tough and over-deep fried, a bit disappointing. The okonomiyaki was heavy on shrimp or fish paste - making the texture rather out of the box. Greens were average, nothing to write home about. The pan fried roll (the ones with the foil wrap) was visually promising but difficult to eat - I got a middle piece and all my corn and chicken fell out right away so I ate it broken up with chopsticks which ruined the experience. Nonetheless, it was tasty and a highlight of the meal. The house rice noodle had lots of toppings, which was nice. The beef noodles met expectations - smelled and looked great upon arrival, plenty of noodles in the bowl, but getting near the bottom the soup was too salty for my taste.

For dessert we got the brown sugar and matcha warabimochi duo. For those unaware, it's a cold dish featuring soft, chewy mochi pieces dusted with powder. It arrived just as the picture in the menu showed, and had a bonus side of red beans. The downside was we didn't get any forks - I guess we had to use the same chopsticks as we had for our dinner? Personally, that ruins the dessert flavour so we asked for toothpicks - but the server didn't understand so we had to ask for chopsticks instead. They mochi were interesting - a little messy to eat because the dusting powder would sprinkle everywhere, the texture was somewhat like marshmallow and jelly, and the two flavours were easily classics that would win the crowd.

Overall, nothing stood out to me to make me revisit - I suppose I'm curious about the personal hot pots but they don't strike me as something I have to come back for. Portions were well sized, prices were not excessive, so if I need a spot with variety I could be back, but getting a table could be a challenge. Desserts had lots of variety, but I like to catch up with friends over dessert and 1.5 hours won't be enough, but there are items I want to try before ruling the place off my list completely."}
{"text":"When I arrived, I was amazed by the lovely interior. It was also very busy, but not we were seated quickly, luckily. When I sat down, I was amazed by the endless lists of food items they offered. They had nice pictures to showcase some of their popular and unique food items. I picked several things I wanted to try with my friends, but unfortunately, 3/5 things we asked for were not available. Overall, food quality was average. Hopefully they'll have the food I want by then."}
{"text":"My friend recommended this place since it recently opened and I have already dropped by several times in the past two weeks or so. 

They have a relatively large menu ranging from snacks to meals to desserts. For my first visit I tried one of the hot pots and shared it among two people. I thought the idea was very nice as it is almost like an individual hot pot. 

As most people mentioned, you can get a dessert or drink (6.99 or below) for free if you post a picture of the food from Mabu on any form of social media. With that, we got the egg custard dessert but didn't think it was anything special.

I'm excited to come back in the future to try some of their rice dishes as well as the endless desserts!

Ps. Definitely recommend making a reservation during busy times so that you avoid the wait as it gets fairly packed."}
{"text":"Overall - 2.5/5.0

Recently opened in First Markham Place, this establishment started out as a cafe in the Yonge/Finch area and has now expanded into a full out restaurant and bar serving up Japanese and Taiwanese food. 

Decor and environment offers an upbeat and hip downtown vibe but definitely failed to reflect that same energy with their service and customer interaction. 

From a menu perspective, you are immediately greeted with two thick menus per person (one for food and the other for desserts and drinks). I had checked out their menu online before arriving and immediately raised red flags. With such an extensive menu, it would be highly unlikely that they can execute each dish well. That was the exact result that I got from Mabu Generation. Trying to strategically pick dishes that would have a higher chance of meeting expectations was a like playing a game of battleship.

We ordered the following:

H03 (Spicy Pig Blood, Pork Intestines, Tofu Soup Hot Pot) - Soup base flavors were one dimensional, not even that spicy and mostly only had a peppercorn taste.

H06 (Japanese Style Miso with Pork Hot Soup) - Friend enjoyed this hot pot and determined it was a safe bet.

M01 (Taiwanese Style Chicken w/ Basil, Ginger, Onion, Hot Pepper Serving w/ Rice on Sizzling Hot Plate) - Decent dish with tender chicken and generous portions. But the flavors could definitely be amped up with more basil and hot pepper essence infused into the chicken. There was no sizzle to be seen or heard.

M05 (Japanese Style Black Pepper Teriyaki Sauce on Sliced Beef w/ Rice on Sizzling Hot Plate) - An underwhelming dish that also had no sizzle. Make sure you stir everything right when you get the hot plate if you want your beef to be a bit more cooked and mixed in well with the rice (which came out a bit chunky).

Q10 (House Special Taiwanese Style Minced Pork on Rice) - A disappointment given that this is a staple item in traditional Taiwanese cuisine. It was nowhere near what I have had in Taiwan and other more reputable places in Toronto. Pork was super lean and it did not come in the traditional short grain Taiwanese rice. 

A20 (Matcha Molten Cheese Tart) - Was tasty and came out piping hot from the oven. However, molten cheese was more like a runny sauce."}
{"text":"This place offers different style of food from Japanese to Taiwanese, but tbh seems like they take menu item from different restaurants and combine into one. Food is pretty decent. I had their hot pot which was okay but hot pot was not propane fuel so it was annoying to ask for another flame cube. ***Also when the waiter brings back your order slip make sure you check it. This place is lacking when it comes to order accuracy, not sure if they just not bother looking at what you write or have difficulties reading numbers. **** Popcorn chicken was crunchy and tasty, beef rice was pretty saucy which made the rice really mushy.
If you post on social media you get a free drink or dessert. Matcha cheese tart wasn't as good as I expected. Rain drop cake your pretty much just eating jello. Other deserts were decent. I did prefer the dessert more than the food"}
{"text":"Ordered the chewy mochi waffle with assorted fruits. Loved it!!! Always wanted to try the waffle style. If you like mochis and you like waffles you'll love this. The fruits were sweet and the waffle was crisp."}
{"text":"A place with a hybrid of Japanese and Taiwanese flavors. This place has an extensive menu of food, drinks and desserts. It's a good place to go if you want lunch/dinner and dessert! The food has pretty good portions and comparable flavours. But I feel like the beef brisket noodle soup was a little lacking in flavor but the popcorn chicken was crispy and the sauce complimented it well. Black sesame toast was great, the paste is a bit gritty but I like it like that. Also ordered a green milk tea with Oreo crumbs which was very refreshing and interesting. Lowkey like it when all the waiters say good morning/night at the same time LOOL, i guess it's comforting? All in all it's a great place for Taiwanese or Japanese food."}
{"text":"We had a few meals here, usually lunch, but more recently dinner. This place is usually crowded because of the plaza and this place does seems like a popular food spot. 

We got the sukiyaki hot pot and shared t along with getting the raindrop cake for dessert. The sukiyaki was a little sweet for my preference by then again I don't like sweet meats but even my partner said the dish was a bit on the sweet side. 

The food here is not amazing but it is quite sizable in portion size the, price is about average, and service is hit or miss (our experience is there is usually one good server amongst the bunch). 

There is a large selection of food on the menu from apps, hot pots, noodle dishes, rice bowls, drinks and desserts. I would recommend the rain drop cake. It is very refreshing on the palate and you can add as much of the sweet brown powder that fits your taste. 

In terms of food I can recommend... I mean I do think the donburi style bowls are a good values, taste is above average but unless you're eating it quickly it not dish that keeps well. 

For those interested in the playoffs they do have one TV. It's not huge but if you don't want to go for sport bar food than this isn't a horrible option (but it also wouldn't be my first choice for Asian food and sports)"}
{"text":"Pretty mediocre place, food wasn't that great. Big menu will give people who have trouble deciding anxiety.

Best thing is this place is open late."}
{"text":"Gigantic dessert tower with toast was delicious but quite gimmicky. 

Meals were typical Taiwanese Asian fusion."}
{"text":"I came here several times for lunch, dinner and desserts when it first opened and the place had long waiting queue. I came back again to visit after a few months and hoped the hype would have settled down but it didn't. Despite the same long waiting time, I was glad to see that they were willing to compensate their customers by offering a choice of free milk pudding or a free drink under $4.99 if the waiting exceeded over 45 minutes. However, this special offer was only written on the waiting ticket in fine print in Chinese. So if you don't know how to read Chinese, you probably wouldn't know unless the servers tell you (but now you do!). You also get 10% discount if you pay cash :)

ENVIRONMENT: 4/5 
The place is pretty big, hip and modern with large art mural of Taipei's famous JiuFen town. Certainly can accommodate small party of two to large groups. 

FOOD: 4/5 
Their menu was massive with a separate menu for desserts and drinks. They offered a good variety of Asian items (mainly Taiwanese and Japanese), pastas, rice and hot pots. I love getting their mini hot pots, mainly because there were plenty different flavours/options to choose from and easy to share. My favourite was the Milk & Cheese Seafood hot pot, wonderful broth and plenty of seafood. The Lamb with Pickled Cabbage hot pot was very appetizing as well. I was also very excited to see that they offered Taiwanese style oyster omelets as not a lot of places served them. Popcorn chicken was crispy, just a bit more batter than meat but I'd still recommend it. So far, I hadn't been disappointed in their food yet.

DESSERT: 3/5 I tried their cheese tarts but but the shell was a bit hard and the cheese texture wasn't the creamy, molten lava type that I liked. I was very surprised to see that they had Japanese Taiyaki in their menu but it cost $11 for a piece. I thought it was overpriced. The milk pudding was alright as it was free for me at the time but I probably wouldn't order them here. Overall, I felt that their desserts were more on the pricey side.

SERVICE: 4/5 
The staff was very tentative and friendly. They did regular check ups and water refills which I especially appreciated. 

I'd definitely come back again because there are just so many items to try! The only thing that pulls me back is just the waiting time..."}
{"text":"This place is pretty decent if you want to go for dessert.  They have an extensive menu of desserts and food however I was only really there for dessert.  I was there on a Friday night around 8-ish and there was about a 20 minute wait for a table.  They get pretty busy during peak times.  There is also a seating time limit of an hour and a half bc it's pretty popular.  

Their dessert menu is large.  If you like dessert I don't think you will have any trouble finding anything you like.  I ordered the taiwanese fried chicken and waffles.  It was actually really good.  I would definitely get this again.  The other tables around us ordered dinner food and it looked just okay.  I would probably just come here for a snack or dessert.  Parking can be a bit hectic here as it's part of the First Markham Place plaza."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times for dinner. I enjoy coming here because the menu is big and has many options to choose from. I've tried their mini hot pots, mapo tofu with rice, and sizzling plates. I love their mini hot pots as it comes loaded with meats and vegetables, and comes with a side of noodles. I've had some of their desserts as well. A downside to this restaurant is the wait times. Every time I come, the line goes out the door and it's hard to get a table right away. I know they do a special where if you post a photo on social media, you can get a free drink."}
{"text":"Mabu is a hit or miss. Some of the dishes are really extraordinary like the udon smoked salmon carbonara. But other dishes lack in flavor and are just underwhelming like the sizzling plates. I had to ask for extra soy sauce and chili sauce. But there individual hot pots are good. They come with a variety of meats and soup flavors for a decent price that will get you full. 
 I go to mabu often because they're open late and have a large variety of Taiwanese and Japanese dishes and desserts. The desserts are good but again some of the desserts are underwhelming like the cream cheese bread and can be very expensive for what it is. It depends on what you try but there are a lot of options. The staff are friendly but seems like they are always under staffed as the restaurant is always busy. Overall this place is decent and I will continue going back to try the rest of the menu."}

Husband ordered a fried cheesy pork with rice and I got a lunch special of Taiwanese braised beef noodles which came with a milk bubble tea and a tiny dessert. 

I was pleasantly surprised with the portions.  The food definitely left the both of us stuffed.  My noodles had a good amount of beef and vegetables.  Husband's meal was more interesting.  His deep fried pork chop oozed out with cheese and fish roe (cheese whiz like consistency).  Overall, the food was better than expected.  

Atmosphere:
Baby friendly!  As a new mom, I honestly forget half the time to go to a baby friendly place but once I'm in a Chinese restaurant, I remember that I should have taken that into consideration.  Things like having a change table, a booster seat and space to put your stroller definitely make your eating experience (and life) much easier when dining with an infant.  Luckily Mabu had all of these things. 

Staff:
Attentive, pleasant and can speak English and Chinese!  No dirty or judgemental looks towards you if you don't speak the language of the homeland.  

Baby friendly, non judgy towards CBC's and good portion sizes with edible food are a thumbs up in my books.  3.5 stars!"}
{"text":"I'm not the biggest fanatic of Taiwanese food and have honestly been dissapointed by other resturants and their poor execution of such cuisine. However, MABU is quite the exception. While there is an extensive menu, do not be overwhelmed; its quite simple if you look through it. The price is fair for mostly everything, from appetizers to entrees. I was quite impressed with my spicy spare ribs, which were tender and served with a reasonable amount of rice. The ribs were well flavoured and came in a nice sauce with fresh scallions and green onions for flavour. The popcorn chicken was lightly fried and came in a fair portion. The octapus balls were also in a fair portion, topped in the works interms of takoyaki. Usually pretty busy, however, they are sure to make service move quickly and to accomodate all customers. Overall, pretty good choice in the selection of resturants at First Markham Place. Great take on Taiwanese cuisine."}
{"text":"Went to this place for dinner last week.  Great interior decoration.  Great food selection.  We got ramen, hotpot and a rice dish.  All taste great.  Will return."}
{"text":"Went with my friends on a Monday afternoon and got a fresh mango slush. In the afternoon they have a buy one get one free drink special. They have a good selection of drinks, dessert, and food. We didn't eat anything, but the other table's food smelled really good! This place is like a typical Asian place like sugar marmalade, etc."}
{"text":"Most of the food we ordered actually wasn't bad, but I couldn't get over how awful their Taiwanese oyster pancake was. When I first saw it on the menu, I was really excited to try as not a lot of Taiwanese restaurants in Toronto offer this dish and it's one of my favourite things to eat in Taiwan. But the one at Mabu left me unimpressed. The pancake had chives and lettuce instead of the cabbage that's used in authentic Taiwanese oyster pancakes. There were also only a couple tiny pieces of oyster and not a lotta sauce, so the whole thing just tasted like starch. 

Even though the other items we ordered weren't all that bad, I probably won't be going back given their prices are quite a bit higher than other better and more authentic Taiwanese options in town."}
{"text":"Passed by this place at night and wondered if it was related to mabu station near yonge and finch. There was a line and everything looked pretty nice so decided to try.

Inside is pretty clean and spacious. The iron fencing, dim lighting, and interesting artwork along the walls really gives it that café feel. Washrooms were also pretty nice.

When we were seated a waitress came to provide menus and an ordering sheet. She then looked up in deep thought and then changed the table number on the order sheet. Guess she might've been new and wasn't sure which table this was.

You get a meal menu and a dessert menu. Both menus have a good number of pictures for reference if you're not sure what to get, and there's definitely a lot of variety.

Ordering is done on a sheet, which can be useful if you don't like talking to waitresses. It can be more efficient I suppose.

We ordered a Hokkaido Molten Cream Cheese Tart. It was pretty good: hot and crispy skin, with somewhat dense cream cheese. Not sure if I'd pay $11.99 for two pieces though. All of the food coming from other tables looked and smelled great too!

When you're getting the bill, they also include a feedback form that you can fill out. Looking at some of the questions, it looks like the waitress was supposed to do more than what she had done lol

The person that brought over our bill got the bill mixed up. The bill itself has the table number, but it was a different person from before so can't say tell if someone got the table number wrong.

Things were resolved quickly, but it just seems a bit messy."}
{"text":"I've been to MABU generation quite a few times and it is a nice restaurant to go to but can be quite pricey. The quality of food is not high enough for the price. However, there are a few dishes that I do recommend, like the rice bowls and the hotpot. There is a huge variety of food on the menu, so it will appeal to many people's taste. It is also quite loud in the restaurant most of the time so it's not a place for conversation. There's also a huge lineup almost every time I go, especially for dinner but even for lunch, so be prepared to wait as you cannot make reservations. Overall, worth a try if you don't mind spending a bit more!"}
{"text":"I'm a Chicago native and we don't have anything like this back at home. The restaurant is really trendy and I feel like all the cool kids hang out here. My cousin and I shared a mini spicy beef hot pot. Honestly worst mistake ever because I had really bad stomach problems the next day lmao. But at the time, the food was pretty good. Really spicy, but it tasted awesome . The waiters are really rushed since the place is almost always packed but they are very timely and do things in a efficient manner. I honestly don't understand why they serve us warm water. Like the food is hot as hell why would I wash the spiciness down with warm water. But it's alright because if you ask for cold water, they'll give it to ya. Overall, I had an okay experience here. Maybe when I come back to toronto I'll try some dessert ..."}
{"text":"A lot to choose from from savoury to desserts and drinks.
Not too bad for a Taiwanese-Japanese concept restaurant.
Reservation is recommended."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday around 12:30 am, place was still pretty full.   If you are looking for late night food this place is pretty good.   Last call for kitchen is around 1-1:30.   

The dessert menu is huge.    There were tons of items to choose from.   Going to have to go back to try some of the other items.

For dessert, I shared (it is pretty filling, share it) brick toast in honey with matcha ice cream and red beans.    This was amazing.   Taste was really good and aesthetically appealing as well.  There are some corn flakes in their to give it a nice crunch and layers of custard to hold it together like building blocks.  The honey and toast together has that campfire marshmallow taste and their matcha and red bean pair so well together.  Only negative about the dessert is that it takes 20-30 min to prepare (but wait staff did warn us when ordering which was nice, to set expectations).

Ordered a mango slush as well.   Flavour was a little on the under whelming side (could have been because of the sweetness of the dessert)

Will definitely be going back.  The crepe cake looks good (saw an Oreo flavour I would like to try) as well as the taiyaki (pastry in the shape of a fish with ice cream), tried ordering that as well but they said the machine was broken."}
{"text":"Popular Taiwanese fusion restaurant in First Markham Place. Gets pretty full around lunch time on weekends and need to put your name down to wait for a table. They have a pretty large selection of food from noodles to hot plates like Flaming Kitchen next door. I personally prefer Flaming Kitchen's hot plates but the dessert selection is better at MABU. Ordered the red bean matcha waffle but since they didn't have the mochi available they substituted it with fruit pieces on the side. The waffle was much larger than expected and perfect for sharing."}
{"text":"I was fairly skeptical coming here because most reviews seem to have been hit or misses (especially with the molten matcha cheese tart which just looked like a runny mess from others' photos)! However, I was just so intrigued by the extensiveness of their menu that I was determined to give it at least one try. 

I came for a late night (past 11pm) meal with my boyfriend and the restaurant was still pretty busy - about half of the restaurant was full. It wasn't too loud and I liked how modern the interior design was. Anyway, we went waaaay overboard with ordering because we wanted to try everything and here's what we had:

1) French fries = they weren't good but they weren't terrible either.. large portions but I wouldn't order them again.
2) Takoyaki = yum! It seems that for each ball, they put in 2-3 smaller pieces of octopus instead of 1 large chunk. Decent order for price and value.
3) Mabu Roasted Milk Black Tea = this one came free (minus the added tapioca topping) for posting a photo of their food on social media and it was actually really unique! Would recommend.
4) Creamy Cheese Udon w/ Bacon, Half Boiled Egg & Fresh Salmon Roe = I ordered this because of the \"salmon roe\" but lo and behold, they actually give smoked salmon instead.. I mean, I gotta say I was disappointed that they lied on their menu but overall, the dish was really good. Super rich and creamy sauce and loaded with toppings! Also, fyi: the egg is more like a half POACHED egg (I was kinda expecting a half HARD boiled egg)
5) Japanese Style Pork Chop w/ Black Pepper Teriyaki Sauce, Curry w/ Rice, Cheese on Sizzling Hot Plate = phew, what a mouthful. I must say, this dish came out looking preeeeetty unappetizing but the flavours were great! They went heavy on the black pepper but it was balanced out by the savoury and sweet flavours of the curry and the stringy melted cheese.
6) Brown Sugar Warabimochi & Matcha Warabimochi Mix = My boyfriend wanted this and at first, I was reluctant to let him because the picture didn't look very appetizing and we already had so much food. He won in the end though and ordered it anyway and I was actually surprised at how good it tasted! Yes, it still is just a cube of flour and water (as mochi are) but it was a very easy-to-chew texture and was generously coated in high quality matcha powder. Unfortunately, we had to pack this home because we couldn't finish it and it was spoiled by the next morning.
7) Red Bean Matcha Ice Cream Mochi Chewy Waffle = When perusing online at their menu, this was what I wanted to order the most and I'm so glad that it didn't disappoint! For most of the haters, the general complaint is that this is \"too chewy\" but it already says so in the title of the menu item so.. I mean.. what were you expecting?? This was great in my opinion! Strong hints of matcha in a delectably chewy mochi waffle paired with cold, sweet ice cream and smooth, gelatinous matcha pudding, finally complemented with sweet red bean paste! Yum! Great dessert, and I would recommend sharing it with at least 2+ people because this is like a meal in itself. It's a bit too dense for one person for one sitting (if you want to get other food too)!

What a long review. Hope my comments help! I would definitely say that the overall price range of is this restaurant is \"expensive\" comparatively to all other eateries around it BUT I MEAN, this place opens to 2-3am in Markham and offers such extensive menu offerings. That's pretty rare. You could also get yourself a free drink with a social media post so I'd say it's a good deal and I'd likely come back again!"}
{"text":"This is the second time i came here because i like the restaurant's concept. They offer variety of selection including Taiwanese food. 

I totally agreed with some yelpers mentioned \"Staff need more training\" becuase no one greet us which I standed in front of the counter for 10 minutes. There were staffs passed by but they ignored us like \"i am not the host, it is not my job to greet customers, so keep waiting.\" I guess they dont care about lossing customers like us, party of 2. Also, I saw a staff work around while food in her mouth (it is not busy hour now, 3:15pm)

I odered a deep fried pork chop Q04, the receipt show the order time 2:41pm, and i wait until 3:15 and asked the staff, where is my food. She return back with an answer said they give it to the wrong table. Ummm ok, so just cancelled it please. In return, they offer a free dessert to us as apology. We ordered an original cheese bread.....the staff served it to the wrong table agin (the table beside us). Anyway, we finally got it. And the cheese bread was really disappointed. Hard, dry and it isnt soft at all. This is not what a cheese bread should taste like!!!!! My best friend used to make this all time time and i know!

We also ordered deep fried fish cake and the okonomiyaki. My first impression to these 2 dishes was all about mayo. Regular mayo."}
{"text":"Came here as a party of 4 for dinner at 6:45pm. Did not have to wait and was seated immediately. 

2nd time here and unlike my first review, this time the food did not take as 2nd time here and unlike my first review, this time the food did not take as good.

Only exception would be the wrap with the hash brown (3.5/5).

I ordered a hot pot with salty and sour soup base (2/5). I did not like it at all.

One friend ordered the sizzling rice pan with black pepper chicken. He seemed to like it.(3/5)

 Another friend got spaghetti Bolognese with taiwanese style fried chicken. She shared some with me and it was just OK  (3/5). 

Last but not least, MR got the wine chicken hot pot (1/5). Soup did not taste good. 80% of the pot consisted of cabbage.

Needless to say, we won't be back for awhile..."}
{"text":"Me n my friend, table for two came in at 8:00pm waited 25mins. Was quite surprised that we needed to wait at 8pm on a monday night. Probably the hype of new opening. The hostess with glasses provides great service. We ordered two items- seafood, milk & cheese hotpot and potato croquette stuffed w/ cheese & crab meat. The milk hotpot was not bad, yummy soup base and comes with 3 shrimp, 3 mussels, 3 clams, 3 squid... The reason im giving 2 stars becuze of the potato croquette, its 100% deceiving!!! We picked it becuz it was chef choice, but there was no cheese and crab meat!!!! Another 2-star becuz of the dreamy server. The hostess did mention it was 1 hr seating but by the time one hr passed, its 9pm and there were couple of tables left... one of the female server gave us the bill and asked if we were paying cash or credit card. My friend was asking if i want to pay cash, n for some reason this server thought my friend was saying we will pay cash, and she mumble herself \"oh cash\". Me and my friend were helpless.. Last reason for the 2 star becuz the prices on take out menu is different than the dine-in menu... hostess told us becuz the resto juss open so things arent ready.. WHATTTT?!? If u r not ready, then why open??? But the matcha molyeb cheese tart not bad! Overall this is an adventurous dinner!"}
{"text":"Came here for dessert around 9pm. Place was very busy, about a 30 minute wait. They serve both meals and dessert?s with separate menus for each.

Our desserts arrived in the following order:
- Raindrops
- Mochi platter
- Tofu Fa
- Brick toast

Horrible, just horrible! They raindrops look cool but they taste so bad. Better to admire from afar as you may spit it out once you put it in your mouth... They are only good for ordering and taking a picture of it, nothing more!

Mochis are so so, they are edible but nothing to write home about. Flavours are blah.

Tofu Fa is served cold and comes with a bunch of sides to mix in. Honestly I think their sides, mochies, barley, black sesame ball, etc make it taste worse. However this was the first dessert that actually tasted decent. 

Finally the tower of brick toast arrived. I'm not a big brick toast fan as it's just thick toast with a spread. That being said, this brick toast was good. It was a mix of tiramisu flavour with custard and ice cream. This place would have been rated 2 stars for me but the brick toast salvaged an extra star. 

In the end, these items cost us about $50, so yes this place is quite expensive. Presentation is good for all items but looks can be deceiving! The only reason I rate this place 3 stars is due to their brick toast tower, otherwise it would have a much lower rating in my books!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch.  Not the best value meals.  Ordered the pepper eef noodles and endeded up being very spicy (they should have added a sign on the menu).  Portions are very small and as others commented the eggs that come on the rice bowls are not fully cooked, not even close to being pouched.   Will not return here."}
{"text":"We ordered the Matcha mochi waffle ($10.99) and the Matcha molten cheese tart ($10.99). 

Matcha mochi was inside the waffle and gave the waffle a chewy texture. Portion wise is quite large and needs to be shared since it's a heavier dish with the mochi. It was topped with lots of red bean, a scoop of ice cream and whipped cream. This was a decent dish with strong matcha flavour but since I'm not a huge fan of red bean, I would not get this again.

The biggest disappointment is the matcha molten cheese tart. This dish comes with 2 tarts. It was not molten at all, and on top of that it was burnt. Flavour wise it's like a cheesecake in a tart shell. Matcha flavour wasn't really there and it was filled with red bean. Hopefully other customers had better luck with this dish than I did.

This is a typical bubbletea/taiwanese cafe place to come to once in a while. I would come here again to try other stuff since their menu is quite extensive."}
{"text":"I've been to Mabu three times since it opened, all for dinner. Unfortunately each time I came, the experience got worse :( I got the sukiyaki hotpot the first time, and it was pretty good other then the fact that the meat was still frozen. The second time I got another Japanese dish from the don section, and the dish was COLD but that wasn't indicated anywhere on the menu. It was kind of confusing because the rice was like, lukewarm temperature? My experience today was definitely the worst. I got the baked spaghetti with meatballs, and the meatballs were not cooked through and the center was completely hard! I had to spit it out. The WORST part was, when we explained it to the manager, he didn't even apologize! He simply looked at it and took it away. I was shocked at the lack of customer service that came from a manager.They did give me a new one with cooked meatballs, but it was very oily and heavy and I couldn't finish it. We also got the Korean marshmallow dessert with the ice cream inside since our friend said it was really good last time, but when we tried it all we tasted was burnt. It was so bad my friend had to spit it out, and he swore it was definitely not the same the last time he tried. For the most part though, the other waiters and waitresses were nice and filled our tiny cups of water often. It seems they lack food quality consistency and the managers don't give a shit about customer service."}
{"text":"Thought I'd give this place a try after paying so many visits to Mabu Station in North York. Great atmosphere, the restaurant has really nice decor, but I'm probably not going back anytime soon. 

Food could've been more fresh, tasted like below average Chinese food to be very honest. The menu was very standard, nothing stood out to me and the prices were eh. 

Service was mediocre too, nothing to really compliment but I don't have too many complaints either. They screwed up the bills, and drenched my green tea with way too much sugar but I didn't have that high of expectations to begin with. 

Compared to Mabu Station, which has been very busy every single time I've been, this place was pretty empty. There are a lot of better options in the First Markham Place plaza that I'd rather go for next time."}
{"text":"A million food options as Chinese cafe styles often do. The hot pot is actually really filling! I also liked the bubble tea! Sizzling plate rice dish was not great.. the curry rice was mushy and very salty.  Last time we tried a sizzling plate with cheese & ribs (just swimming in oil!). Dessert was a miss too :/. Service is not great.. and primarily mandarin speaking staff. Very busy/long wait times unless u arrive early! Cute decor and comfy booths too!"}
{"text":"We arrived after 6:30 p.m. on a Friday evening and boy, was the place packed!  I got a number from the hostess at the front of the room in the midst of many other people who were waiting for a table.  The hostess informed me that the wait would be around 30 minutes.  Luckily, I noticed that there were a lot of tables finishing up their meals at this time and thus our wait wasn't as long as it could have been during the prime time dinner period.

The Taiwanese Style Popcorn Chicken was the first to arrive. I love popcorn chicken and will try to order it any time I see it on the menu. This Popcorn Chicken was decent. I thought that the batter was a little more thick and crumbly than usual though and just a tiny tad dry.

The Cheese Hash Brown Egg Pancake is a Taiwanese dish that I don't see often in restaurants in Toronto.  I've had this breakfast item in Taiwan before and enjoy it.  I thought that the hash browns inside this egg pancake was a different twist on things. I thought that the pancake skin could have been more thin.

The Okonomiyaki looked great but I thought that it was just so-so.  It was very dense and Okonomiyaki should remain fluffy after being cooked.

The Grilled Oysters with Avocado, Garlic, Mayo and Cheese on top came in two little ceramic containers.  I thought that this was so-so.  There wasn't enough grilled oyster meat inside the dish, I found.  The avocado also wasn't very obvious in the dish.

The Potato Croquette Stuffed with Cheese and Crab Meat was pretty good!  However, I don't remember tasting much crab meat in it at all...

The Baked Cheesy Japanese Rice Cakes came with the same type of Asian-style cheese sauce that the previous two dishes arrived in.  Tracy enjoyed the rice cakes but I thought that they were too firm and chewy for my liking.  Also, these were quite spicy and spicier than I expected!

Unfortunately, on this visit, we weren't able to try out their multitude of desserts.  They have a variety of baked cheese tarts with cheese that oozes out as well as toast desserts and many other popular desserts that are currently trending on the food scene.  I can't wait to return to try more of their food and especially the desserts!"}
{"text":"I had the okonomiyaki and it was okay. My friend had the popcorn chicken and it was okay too. The place is always super busy! I liked the decor inside. It was a little pricey for the quality and quantity of food. We got a free dessert for sharing a picture of the food on social media and that was not bad! 

Not sure if I could come back but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"Mabu Generation may be one of the worst restaurants in Markham.  We should have known that Mabu was likely not a great restaurant when we flipped through its menu. The menu was extensive - offering Italian, Chinese, Taiwanese and Japanese. (I do not know what spaghetti is doing in a Taiwanese menu.) From my experience, a long and extensive menu means the restaurant is a \"master of none\". There is simply no way the kitchen staff could expertly prepare all of the dishes offered in the menu in a competent manner.

We ordered Mabu's trademark Taiwanese hotpot. The hotpot came with half an instant noodle, vegetables and some meat. The hot pot was served on a small burner. The broth was overly salty. The ingredients did not seem fresh. 

The other dishes we ordered were very medicore at best. I would definitely not recommend this place to anyone. There are simply better restaurants in Markham - do not waste your time or money at Mabu.

The one star is for the modern design of the restaurant. Too bad the food served at this restaurant does not live up to the design.

In fact, Mabu was so bad that we decided to go elsewhere for dessert. We did not want to try anything else on that menu. We will not be back."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night at 6pm. At 6pm, you will receive the last few tables in the busy restaurant or else it will be a long wait. 

Firstly, the menu at Mabu is very extensive. So far, I recommend the milk and cheese seafood mini Taiwanese hot pot, the black pepper garlic beef sizzling plate, and the spicy intestine sizzling plate. Although the food is rich, tasty and flavorful, the food took half an hour to arrive. However, it gives you time to chat with your friends so it's not so bad. 

Secondly, service here is okay. They're not amazing but at least the servers will come regularly to refill your water glass. 

Furthermore, if you pay cash, it will be 10% less. 

I'll definitely be back soon to try more food from the menu!!"}
{"text":"Very busy place!! I came here once around 10. We ended up waiting in line for nearly 30 minutes!! I consider this place pretty large for a dessert place but it seems to always be packed... Minus one star for wait time. 

After finally being seated, we were giving two menus, one for appetizers and meals, and another for desserts and drinks. We ordered one of their Taiwanese style mini hot pot, clams and grass jelly. For the hot pot we also added instant noodle and when it came, they only gave us half of an instant noodle, for $1.99 I expect the full size, not half. As for the clams, the portion was already considerably small for $13.99, there also wasn't much clam meat, mainly shells, you can even see in the picture I've attached to this review. Finally for the dessert, massive bowl of grass jelly with toppings on the side, which I liked that way I could add as much or as little as I prefer. The red bean, sweet peanuts and their q balls mixed with the grass jelly was probably my favourite part out of the whole meal. 

Overall experience it was okay, if I were to ever come back it would probably be for the dessert."}
{"text":"This place seems to be always packed no matter the time. 
Restaurant is clean and modern, with dim lighting.

Seem to be short-staffed as waiters/waitresses are always busy. 
Waitresses are not the greatest at waiting tables.  Would seat a couple into a 4-persons table even though there was a table of 4 waiting.  Often times, 2-persons table would go empty until a couple came in.

L11 Okonomiyaki - great appetizer to split
L15 Taiwanese Style Popcorn Chicken - generous portions; fresh and tasty
L24 Potato Croquette Stuffed w/ Cheese & Crab Meat - not cheesy at all
H08 Japanese Style Sukiyaki Hot Pot - a little bland, but comes with hot spices to spice up the flavour
M05 Japanese Style Black Pepper Teriyaki Sauce on Sliced Beef w/ Rice on Sizzling Hot Plate - very generic, nothing special
Q02 Taiwanese Style Deep Fried Pork Chop w/ Black Pepper Sauce on Rice - very generic, nothing special
S04 Roasted Meat Ball w/ Bolognese Sauce, Cheese & Garlic on Spaghetti - very generic, nothing special; small portion (not suitable for sharing)

A20 Matcha Molten Cheese Tart - not enough matcha taste, little too cheesy
T12 Orea Milk Green Tea/Black Tea - not as great as the one at The Alley
T14 Mabu Roasted Milk Green Tea/Black Tea - a little too sweet 
T15 Sesame Milk Green Tea/Black Tea - taste like black sesame paste
T09 White Peach Pomelo Mandarin Orange Green Tea/Black Tea - can definitely taste the different fruit flavours

Would recommend overall (if you ignore the poor service waiting tables)."}
{"text":"I love the food here every time. The hotpot is very flavorful. The rice bowls are topped with a good amount of marinated meats. The okonomiyaki friends are huge!

If you're a fan of tofu, order the garlic tofu, not the satay tofu - satay was bland. The popcorn chicken was not well seasoned but was still good."}
{"text":"I've been there a few times and very good services.  waitress will refill your water. Food has been great! The only thing to remember, if you go after 6:30 on both weekday or weekend, you will expect to line up for at least 1/2 hrs. It's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately the second time coming back it was a huge deterioration from my first time in food and service. Had to wait 45min+ for a seat and the food that came was not very good. Got our orders wrong a few times and didn't have a good attitude. At least there are promotions going on that saves you some $$"}
{"text":"Very busy restaurant but worth the wait.
Mini hot pots are delicious. Service is very good. Sizzling hot plates.  Prices are on the higher end. Give it a try - new fusion"}
{"text":"The waiting time for a table here is an absolute nightmare. My friends and I came here a couple times to see if we could get a table and the hostess always started off with \"maybe....\" and then some random time like 30+ min.

This joint is located at first markham place. I would recommend the noodle soups as it seems like u get the most bang for your buck ordering one of those. I've seen the items from the other sections (the menu is gigantic) and the portion size difference are drastic. Personally I don't think a rice bowl would fill me up here. The creamy pasta with smoked salmon, bacon and mushroom that my friend ordered, looked really good though.

You write your orders on a sheet of paper and hand it to any waiter/waitress. I honestly don't know why the wait times are always so ridiculous for this place but to me it can't be the food because the food is average maybe a little bit above average. Certainly not mind blowing though. And definitely not worth a 20-30+ min wait. Maybe it's because the menu is huge."}
{"text":"Coming into the place, I honestly didn't have much expectations, as fellow Yelpers haven't had tooo much great things to comment about. 

The ambiance and decor was great. A mesh of current and vintage Taiwan pop culture. 
The service for me was actually pretty good, it was dinner and fairly busy, yet the servers would come around a lot and ask if our hotpot needed to add soup or add fuel to our fire. We were asked various times, how was the food etc. 

I agree with my fellow Yelpers that the menus are HUGE. 
The food was not too bad. Well I guess maybe what we ordered was ok. Probably cause my friend had visited before and did the ordering. 

We ordered the seafood cheese hotpot, pork jowl donburi and Taiwanese popcorn chicken. 
We all got a pot of their brown sugar longan and ginger black tea. 

The hotpot was actually quite tasty. Using a cream based soup with tons of veggies, tofu, some frozen seafood (not super impressed with the seafood, but I'll get to that in a bit) bonito flakes and a little bit of processed cheese. 
The soup overall was nice and was very much like the soup base that you would find in a mussel dish. The addition of the bonito flakes gave it a very nice smoky flavour. The seafood seemed to be the frozen kind, while large in size had very little flavour to it's meat. They served it all in a small wok like pot over a blue brick of fuel. The servers would come around to ask if we needed to add soup to the pot or they would replace the brick when they walked by and noticed that the fire was out (which I can appreciate instead of having to constantly wave someone down to do it). 
The hotpot also came with a half of a thing of instant noodles. 

The donburi was...eh ok. The rice and sauce was fairly bland and the egg that's usually on top of the meat was kind of a poached style egg in the corner of the bowl. The saving grace to this dish was the pork jowl itself. The pork was very well marinated. Not too salty. 

The popcorn chicken was a bit of a disappointment, I mean this is a staple in most Taiwanese restaurants. It reminded me of westernized popcorn chicken. Taiwanese style should have more seasoning, the one we got was more like fried pieces of chicken. 

The tea was wonderful! Not too sweet with the addition of the ginger. Served hot and on a metal rack with a tea light to keep it hot. 

Overall experience wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.  Would I come again, well not a hard no but not something I would be itching to go to a lot."}
{"text":"A neat menu combination, with surely something for everyone. Taiwanese inspired fusion food. Personally I tried the cheesy hot pot, clams and tarts. Found the flavor profiles a little blend; could defiantly kick it up a notch and this place would be awesome.

Wouldn't mind coming back to try a few more items, since everything seem so unique.

However, if you come during dinner rush, prepare to wait a bit. The servers were all super friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"We were deciding on lunch and so we came here cause there weren't many places that can seat 15 people on a short notice. Luckily we got ourselves 4 tables cause we were just on time. So the venue is clean and decorated nicely. 

Looking at the menu to choose something to eat can be a bit confusing. Mainly they got too many choices. So I decided on the Ma Po tofu and deep friend pork chop on rice and a side order of fish stick cakes. I will start off with the latter dish. Not bad, though not wowing. As for the Ma Po tofu dish. I don't know, I got quite a few things to say. Perhaps more sauce on the dish will be nice. Another thing is the deep friend pork chop seemed to be fried a second time. That's just my observation. So my thoughts on food wasn't great. Service was nice as the staff are very attentive and all. Will I come back? Probably not."}
{"text":"If anyone has ever tried boiling point this is probably the closest thing to it. However, it's not as good. They have an amazing selection on the menu though so it's hard to choose what to eat. I got the house special hot pot and we waited about 10 mins and the food came, which was pretty quick. The only thing that really bothered me was the soup. The soup was really sour to me and left a unsettling aftertaste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Delicious single person hotpots, especially the one with the cheese and milk soup base. Very creamy and just so-good. Their various sizzling plates were good too. Chicken and waffle was unique, served with a wasabi sauce and syrup.

Would recommend coming with a small group of people to try a bit of each dish. Came during a busy night and waited about 30 minutes to be seated and service was good.

The one downside was the bubbleteas were quite average and served in plastic cups after they ran out of glasses. Make sure you redeem the free tofu pudding - this was topped with cookie crumbles and was very smooth and tasty."}
{"text":"Been here a few times at different times of the day from afternoon snack to dinner to late night drinks. 

Service overall is good. 

Food depends on what you get. 

I enjoy their hot pot although slightly pricier than I would like, however their flavours are good and deep so you can really taste what was described. Portion is good for hungry 1 or even 2 and good for sharing in general. Their popcorn chicken is good as well: crispy and not too salty with juicy chicken (both times I had it). Their rice dishes are hit and miss. Sometimes they have great tastes but other times there's way too much rice. A little inconsistent. Also a bit overpriced as well. I did enjoy their mapo tofu with mixed meat rice dish though.

Lastly dessert was sub par at most. Their drinks weren't really worth their price and the flavours were lacking. Tapioca were on the softer side. Their Taiwanese desserts where you get beans and taro balls and grass jelly etc. I would not recommend. Everything tasted like it was from a can and just not fresh. Never had anything else though because it's super expensive but I heard from friends that they weren't impressed. 

Overall nice late night place to hang out with friends. They do offer alcoholic drinks (I think) and those look very nice."}
{"text":"We were looking for something new to try and stumbled across this place when we were googling. It not an overly big restaurant but the booths are very comfy and the ambiance is inviting.  The restaurant wasn't overly busy when we arrived 6pm on a Saturday night. It didn't get busy until last 730pm.  The menu is quite detailed and provides many choices. We don't know much about Taiwanese food. I ordered the hot pot dish, my hubby had the ma pao tofu with rice and pork chop and my kids had the chicken cutlet with spaghetti. The cutlet was literally the size of two adult hands combined... it was insane.... the food is pretty good and the portions are very generous. The service is pretty good and the servers literally all say bye when you leave. It's a nice quaint restaurant if you want some good hot pot and Taiwanese snacks. We will come back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Excellent place to take a hot date but be sure you go with friends before you do to familiarize yourself with all the menu options. Trying to pick between both their dinner and appetizers along with dessert can be intimidating due to the sheer size of the menus. Excellent Taiwanese service customs."}
{"text":"Service here is absolutely garbage. No one approached the hostess area until I had to flag one of the workers down to ask if they would be serving people. Food is ok, just another Taiwanese style restaurant with bubble tea. I got a ramen here and it was decent but probably not worth the price. Most likely wouldn't come back here."}
{"text":"I've been here 2 times - once for dinner and once for lunch.  I waited 40 mins for the dinner.  It was the holidays season and it was busy, which I understand.  But the 2nd time I visited, it was on a weekday after lunch hours.  There were 3 tables empty in the middle but the hostess just left them empty and went to serve other tables.  Anyway, I couldn't think of anywhere else to go so I waited for 10 mins looking at those empty tables.  

Food - I tried the salmon roe & beef rice, curry pork cutlet rice, and the seasame oil chicken pot.  To be honest, none of them were good.  The beef was dry, salmon roe was fresh tho, and the sauce was good.  The pork cutlet was over-fried.  The seasame oil chicken was very oily and the chicken was very very dry.  

Drinks - I had the oreo milk tea and the sesame milk tea. Both taste good.  

Desserts - you get a free milk pudding if you post a pic on their instagram.  

All toilets were clogged. Yuck! And my friend said he saw a medium sized cockroach behind his chair on his visit.  

Overall, I won't go back again.  The drinks were good but I can always go next door for Sharetea."}
{"text":"Came here for dessert on a friday night and expect to wait 30mins (even just for 2 ppl).

They have some interesting items. I ordered japanese raindrop dessert which are practically balls of gelatin with a chrysanthemum flower in it with brown sugar and soybean flour which makes a pretty IG photo. Other than that I don't find it anything special since the portions weren't huge and it wasn't a wiggly blob (it was a stiff ball).

Decor: dim lights, wood fixtures and hipster vibes with asian music.

They also serve hot meals and snacks too. 

Service is amateur level since I witnessed 2 servers dropping cups and spilling water on customers(So be attentive when they're serving you or passing by your table LOL!) They need more training and hire more servers since it's so busy.

I'd go back if there's no line ups. But i found a better place for authentic chinese dessert (see my next post)."}
{"text":"Although it's a little pricey, the food is delicious! My 4 friends and I shared 2 appetizers, 3 mains, and 3 desserts, after splitting the bill, it was around only $20 per person. It was my friends' first times there, and they all loved it! We cannot wait to go back again. 

It is a great place for all audiences: lunch, dinner, dessert, or drinks, or any combination of those. The honey toast is a must try. It's not too sweet, but you'll definitely need the help from a friend or 2 to finish it! 

The service was excellent. While it took a longer time to get seated, the service at the table was fast and super friendly! And the environment is also very comfortable too."}
{"text":"MABU GENERATION. Dun,dunnn, dunnnnnnnn. (Now picture something coming out on a pedestal in a movie with shining light). I came here for lunch on a weekday around 1:00pm, and man, this place is pretty packed. I was lucky enough to come when there wasn't anyone waiting for seats and there were still empty tables, or else, the last time I wanted to try this place out for dinner, the waitress said we needed to wait an hour.

The decor definitely had a Taiwanese style to it. It had beautiful antique posters of famous Taiwanese female artistes on them and a large wall painting. The lights were dim, the seats were quite low, but large and comfy. We were seated right away and the waitress asked us if we came here before, which we said no to, and she nicely explained how it worked at MABU. They leave you with a piece of paper and you write what it is you want to eat, and there's an option box for what you want (drink, appetizer or dessert). The waitress served us very interesting cups to hold our water-it had a handle that didn't really do much.

The lunch special is $10.99. On the menu, it says it comes with an appetizer, drink (green, milk, or green and milk bubble tea, hot/cold), or dessert. I'm not sure if that was the old deal, or I'm just reading it wrong, but I think you only get one of the three choices! 

We decided to try the Taiwanese Style BBQ sausage and minced pork on rice and the Taiwanese Style Stewed Beef Noodle in Soup. The bowl of Taiwanese Style BBQ sausage and minced pork on rice was mediocre - I think Papa Chang's definitely has it a little better. I really quite enjoyed the stewed beef noodle in soup, it was natural and rich in flavour of it's own! The food came a little slower than usual, and I could tell the waiters and waitresses were all worked out - there were 2 waitresses and 1 waiter who was walking in an out of the bar area making drinks etc, and one more for cash!

After reading the menu, I think I would come back for the hotpot - it looks big enough to share between two people and it's $15.99 for a pot!"}
{"text":"I love mabu and I have gone many times
My favourites are the fried pork cutlet with curry rice and the curry beef udon noodles. average price with good portions and also comes on a sizzling hot plate 
for dessert I like the cube square towers. their so cool and yummy 
it's usually packed so it's good to go earlier 
I'd pass on the drinks tho pretty expensive and not that good 
also the decoration inside is beautiful 
woohooo I love it everyone should go"}
{"text":"Very nice decor, wait time was ok, gave us time to look at the menu and figure out what we want. Ordered the special mini hot pot , sizzling beef, and curry clams. The mini hot pot is heated with the blue gel they light up. Not a fan of the taste of the broth it's nothing I ever tasted before. I wanted to pick the special because there was so many other flavours to choose from so I was hoping the special would be their best basic one. Disappointed that we both couldn't eat it. The sizzling beef was better in flavour, sweet but is more rice then there is beef. Tiny slices. Clam is ok but got sick of the taste and wasn't able to finish it. Mind that we came hungry and ordered a lot. Hard to figure out what to get when almost all menu items are chef recommended. For dessert ordered tiramisu and the mountain of toast covered in cream. Toast was super thick and fills you up after eating a couple squares. Tiramisu is just cake and cream. Wouldn't return unless it's for other dessert items on the menu I wanted to try. Was not worth $75."}
{"text":"We ordered three things: their beef don, tom yum udon and a dessert. The tom yum tasted so bad I couldn't even finish it and their proportions are small to begin with. The shrimp was tasteless and you couldn't even peel off the skin properly. They drowned my plate in tom yum sauce and the entire bottom of the beef don bowl was drown in its own sauce so you couldn't eat the rice at the bottom. 

Since our main courses were terrible we didn't even want to know what dessert tasted like. Ugh!

The only reason why this has a 1 star rating is because we can't give it 0. 

P.s. We went to McDs right after, ordered burgers, baked apple pie and a mcflurry and they tasted GREAT. Better than anything we would have ever gotten at MABU."}
{"text":"Summary: woefully small portions, less-than-stellar-tasting rice/noodle, overwhelming menu, iffy dessert, and seemingly overworked service staff detract from tasty hot pot and a great-looking place with a cool atmosphere 

Top Must-Get: Popcorn Chicken 
Top Regret: Raindrop Cake (seriously, it tastes like two gobs of jello-water)

We came here to try something new for a post-sports meal as a group of 10 on a Wednesday night around 9:30 pm. It's a classy looking place with a very \"polished\" feel; lighting is a bit dim though (probably going for the ambient feel, but I don't love it). 

SERVICE
It was fairly busy but we got a seat right away (the last long table available) - the group after us had to wait a little longer. However, service after that was on the slower end: they mixed up one of our orders, and forgot to put in a dessert (until we prompted them again).

They have a very extensive menu; it took us over 15 minutes to decide and we were a hungry bunch. Their ordering system is somewhat different too - you write what you want on a slip of paper that is split into different categories ex. Mains, Desserts, etc.

FOOD
A number of our teammates got the Taiwanese Hot Pot. The seafood/milk/cheese variant was reported as quite delicious. The \"house special hot soup\" was true to it's name: hot - both in temperature and spice. The portion size looked a little small, and they all range from $15.99 - 16.99. (4/5)

I got a braised chicken with sesame oil on rice. The chicken was not very tender, considering it was bone-in. The pieces were small, as was the overall portion. Flavour was lacking even though it looked thoroughly seasoned. (1/5)

I then decided to give a more traditional dish a try - the red braised beef noodle soup. This was distinctly better: a still-small but not-disappointingly-dinky portion, and fairly appetizing beef. I've had better, but this was solid (3.5/5).

Appetizers: we only got one, but this was the highlight: their popcorn chicken is crunchy and tasty! 

Dessert: the Raindrop Cake with Sakura was $9, and it's basically water flavoured jello with crushed Cheerios on the side. In the words of the person who ordered, \"I finally know what disappointment tastes like\". (0.5/5)

The House Special Milk Pudding was much better (on the house if you take a social media shot of the food) (4/5).

Glad we tried it, but we're probably not coming back."}
{"text":"1. Waiting in line with a number. I am in front of the hostess table. Shes call all the numbers ahead of me. I see a group after me get seated first. Look at their numbering chart. See my uncalled number crossed off. Get seated right away after showing them my number (after waiting 45 mins). 

2. Food took a very long time to get to our table. But before our ordered food arrived, we were given not one but two orders that belonged to other tables. 

3. After our meals (which were ok), we asked for our dessert. The first one came quickly, the double fromage cheese cake. The one from Tsjuiri is amazing, so we thought maybe it would be similar. Nop. To be fair, it may have been good but just in comparison, it can't compete. Anyways, we were a group of 3, they have us two spoons, and promptly left. We tried to grab another server for another spoon and that was a mission in itself (took approx. 10 mins). Then we waited another 20 or so minutes for our next dessert, the raindrop cake. Which we thought would be the quickest, as it should just pop out of the fridge. Anyways, wasn't as \"raindrop-y\" as I hoped. It was like a lychee jello with sakura.

Its amazing that this place is this busy. Maybe I just didn't get the best dishes or it was just an unorganized group of staff, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Really like this place. Food and drinks are good. I like their beef and fish roe on rice! Recommended!"}
{"text":"The menu is huge so took a while but decided on the okonomiyaki (L11), sliced beef and salmon roe on rice (N06), and the Japanese style sukiyaki hot pot (H08). 

The line up here to get a table is long (waited 40+ mins on Fri night around 8 pm), but once seated, the food comes quite fast. 

The okonomiyaki wasn't very authentic with the shredded dry pork shavings, and could have used more cabbage and less batter. But it was still crispy, not greasy, and quite tasty.

The sliced beef and salmon roe was an interesting combination. I found the roe was too salty and didn't go too well with the rest of the dish (maybe good for people that like salty, but not for me). The egg was cooked perfectly and oozed all over the rice, which was nice. The beef and BBQ sauce they used was really delicious. However, there was way too much rice and not enough beef.

The sukiyaki soup base was also not very authentic. Definitely could have used more mirin (Japanese rice wine) and a touch more sugar (too much soy sauce flavor and again very salty). Not sure what the Chilli paste and hot sauce that came on the side was for. But at least it came with the raw egg to dip the meat in to make it somewhat authentic. Also, we had to ask to get a 2nd block of fire gel, since the first one went out before the pot came to a boil. They also gave very little meat. 

Overall, the food quality is just ok, and way too salty for my taste. The service and atmosphere is good. The food portions are decent, although they don't give much meat. I would say the main entrees are reasonably priced, the drinks are similarly priced with a place like go-for-tea, but the desserts are way over priced.

For posting photos online, we got a free dessert worth up to $6.99. Unfortunately, there is only one dessert item that is that price, so you are stuck getting the little egg custards in the egg shell. Not very good, but since it was free, can't complain. 

Although it was nice to try this place, I would much prefer going to the new Go For Tea location on Enterprise Dr. I would say that place has better tasting food for cheaper price, and don't need to wait 40 min in line and no need to fight over parking spots."}
{"text":"Long line ups on weekends and they dont take reservations.   Had a few hot plates and tried the brick toast desert and taro tea.  It was a pass, taro tea not so good, and brick toast was better than others."}
{"text":"I would never come to this place ever again! I went there with my friends on Saturday night to have dinner with dessert. My friend ordered the hot pot. When the waiter brought the hot pot, he did not slip or get tripped but the space is really tight cause we have four people and we sit in the booth. The waiter  seems directly throw the hot pot in front of my friend and cause the boiling soup came out from the pot and the soup was all over the table. I was sitting right in front of my friend so the hot soup also dropped on my cloth as well. Now here has some safety issue. First, the hot pot has a lite candle underneath with the boiling soup and food. Everything has already set up before they place it in front of you. Imagine if the hot soup and the lite candle all comes out when the waiter through the hot pot to my friends. Seriously we both will get injured or maybe get burned because of the boiling soup and the lite candle! Second, I do not understand why the waiter can not lite the candle after they put the hot pot on the table? Because if you have been to HoPo, that's what they did before. It's more safe for the waiter and the costumers. Third, after all these drama, the waiter did not give us any apologies for the accident! Last, I highly suggest the restaurant redo the space planing, if it is not because of the tight squeezing booth the waiter would not have this problem when they serve those type of food! Please tell me am I over react for this or they really should come up a better way when they serve the hot pot with the boiling hot soup!"}
{"text":"Despite being so busy and hectic, the staff is quite polite and thoughtful.   We \"lucked out\" and got the last seat available...the staff warned us it would be cold if we did not want to wait (we were hungry so we braved it)-he was thoughtful enough to point a heater at us so the cold was not as bad.

There are many choices with a strong Taiwanese influence.  Taste and presentation of the food was good.  With some many different food choices at FMP, this is a nice change.   Lots of unique drinks too!

There is a 10% cash discount so remember to bring some cash with you.  If you forget to bring cash, don't worry, they take credit but obviously you lose the discount.

Give it a shot..I don't think you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"I can see from the cool lighting features, giant mural, and sleek bench seating that this would be a cool place to check out. But unfortunately after trying MABU generation out, I was left feeling a bit confused and overwhelmed with the menu but underwhelmed with the food. 

They serve hot pot, Taiwanese cuisine, sizzling plates, donburi bowls and more.  I ordered the pork jowl with house special BBQ sauce on rice. The BBQ sauce was nice but the jowl was very tough. There was also a relatively small amount of protein vs rice. There was a slightly off flavour which I assume was the cold soft egg on top, which would have been better served warm. Hubby ordered the beef, chicken and spicy tofu on rice which was okay. We also had the okonomiyaki which was my first time having it. I was not prepared for the gelatinous texture of mochi in my omelette which was off putting for both hubby and I.  The fruit tea was good and served in a nice carafe with its own heating plate. 

All of our food choices were chef's recommendations but even these were hit and miss. My impression is that this place is trying to be too many things to too many people but unfortunately they fell short of my expectations. Despite this I'd probably try the restaurant out again, but probably for dessert or snacks."}
{"text":"Lots of food choices but nothing is exceptional. 
Drinks are okay better than most. 
Service is a pain if you dont know how to speak mando or cando. 
Only come here if its late at night and you want to eat and grab a bbt and dessert at the same place"}
{"text":"Mediocre \"hot\" spot in Markham...
Heard all about the hype with the brick toast and whatnot... had to give this place a try. Honestly you're better off going to aka teppan and then head to Tracy dessert after. 

I saw a review about people \"not understanding why they don't like this place so much\" ... no it's not the long wait or line ups. It's the quality. 

For this restaurant, it's a case of \"quantity over quality\" when I just rather prefer quality OVER quantity. 

Pros: variety of menu choices dessert/drink/food all had their own menus
- designated lady to keep our glasses from being empty of water 
- milk pudding was pretty good... creamy texture with some cheesecake or some sort of crumbs on top 3/5 stars 

Cons: quality of the food. 
Thai sweet and sour chicken wings were horrible. They were drenched in this thick \"sweet and sour\" sauce... more like they just mixed corn starch and pineapple juice together. 1.5/5 stars 

Black pepper chicken hot stone pot was overly loaded with black pepper; no flavor at all.. chicken was definitely not the best. 1/5 stars 

Honestly, I had doubts about this place because how could it be that a restaurant this big with so many menu options be so perfect? I was right... they are probably understaffed in the kitchen and sauces were probably pre-made and microwaved. 

Would not recommend this place to anyone. 
No pictures to prove how gross this was.. it just wasn't yelp/Snapchat/Instagram-worthy!! 

I want my money back."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times and I must say my experience was not consistently good. Some items I got were pretty delicious but other plates had me wishing I had picked something else from their extensive menu selection! Overall MABU offers a huge variety (almost too much) so do your research on what the popular items are!"}
{"text":"Amazing variety n food! Can't stop looking at the menu for more food but I can't seem to have everything. I love how if I post the food on social media I get a free dessert or a drink.

Recommendations to everyone is not to get the same drink as your friends or if you want to wait to reorder after. Last time both of my friends got a ginger milk and there wasn't enough ginger. This was comparison to the previous time when we just got one ginger milk. 

We shared a green tea brick toast and it was good. The best one out of all the places that I've had."}
{"text":"Mabu generation has a variety of food from noodles, rice, hot pot, and dessert. There is also a big bar where you can order drinks as well. If you have a group of friends that can never decide what to eat, going to mabu will probably satisfy everyone. 

Ordered the matcha ice cream mochi waffle and the texture was quite chewy since they incorporated the mochi inside the waffle. It's an interesting dish since other places make regular waffles that are covered in fruits and ice cream so I recommend trying it. 

The only thing I disliked was the screaming of goodbye when someone leaves especially when they are across the whole restaurant. It is not that professional and can get quite annoying."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is authentic. Taste is exactly what I remembered from back home. Very friendly staff too"}
{"text":"Poor service. Our server was rude and mean and acting like if she want to be fired. Long wait time. The quality of food does not worth it's price. Would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what to make of MABU Generation, it feels unfair having to review them for one item but I won't be rushing back to try them again. That being said, this place seems like a great place if you have no idea what you would like to eat because their menu is so comprehensive, from meals to desserts. 

I was initially supposed to go to Aka Teppan right beside it, but decided to try something new because new is always good! Modern decor, rather dimly lit, seems like a cool place to be. Okay, let's go in. 

I went with the 'house special' grilled salmon don which was disappointing to say the least because I could have made the exact same thing at home. The special bbq sauce I've heard a lot about wasn't all that special. I felt there could have been more and that it could have been sweeter. Also, nowhere does it say there would be semi-cooked egg whites in the middle of rice. It didn't enhance the dish like an egg in a bibimbap. But on the positive side, the salmon was also decent itself as it was nicely grilled and the the portion size was quite generous. You will definitely be leaving full after one of these. 

Service was great with no problems at all. Water was filled frequently despite the busy-ness of the place. I really like the concept of the place overall (modern + traditional takes), so I'll definitely return one day."}
{"text":"My friends and I just arrived for dessert as we were already eating in the area. We only had to wait 10 minutes for a table which is great as the place was packed. The momment we entered I noticed a good energy and smell in the restaurant. We decided to order Some slushies and dessert to share. The service was fast and they came by regularly to check on us. One of our drinks came out last after our food and drinks had already been on the table for 10 minutes. We just had to remind the staff when they asked if everything was ok. It was quickly brought over after that. My only issues were the random and strange smells that came from the kitchen. Most smelled amazing but one smell made us want to leave. I will come back here again and try some different dessert options."}
{"text":"Honey Citrus with Beer
It tastes like juice but it goes down like beer. Not bad but it is not that attractive to an alcoholic drinker. I would prefer a straight up Coroner with a piece of lime

Cheesecake with Matcha Ice Cream and Red Bean (score 8.0/10)
The cheesecake is similar to the Japanese style cheesecake, it is soft and fluffy. The cheesecake is a bit sweet to me and the richness of the cheese flavour has overtaken the taste of the Matcha ice cream as well as the Matcha sauce and red bean paste. I would prefer to eat each of the individual ingredients separately cos after the ice cream melted on top of the cheesecake, the cheesecake became soggy.

Having said that, I would full marks on presentation, both dessert and drink are so beautiful to look at."}
{"text":"Decided to come here on Friday night to try out their menu as we've passed by several times before and saw huge line ups. Today was the perfect occasion as we had no idea what to eat. The environment is quite nice looks vintage. Staff are nice and attentive on refilling water and seeing if you needed anything else. Food was prepared quite fast and everything tasted really good with nice presentation. My boyfriend is quite the picky eater but he said we will be back! During this visit we had Taiwanese minced pork rice, sizzling pork cutlet Japanese style rice and okonomiyaki fries."}
{"text":"Food
=============
We've been here a couple times now and the food seems to be either a hit or miss.  

The Taiwanese and Chinese seems to be better than the Japanese or Korean food.  Classic dishes like the braised beef brisket in noodle soup (?????) was very tasty!  

They have a personal hot pot menu and the selection has something for everyone. 


** MATCHA MOLTEN CHEESE TART**
 Japan and they also have these style of cheese tarts in Chinese and Japanese bakeries around the area.
- DO NOT BUY--save your money.  The tarts are not molten ooey-gooey-cheese as the menu photo suggested.
- It's a nice looking tart but once you open it up, cloudy cheese water spills out (see photos).
- There was no creamy filling, just cheese water and something that resembled watery yogurt.


Drinks
=============
The drinks are okay, but I don't think I'll be ordering it again next time.  For the prices they charge you can get better bubble tea elsewhere.


Service
=============
Seems to be improving every time we go.  The service is on par with most Bubble Tea restaurant, curt but not to the point of rudeness.


Cleanliness
=============
Pretty clean every time we have gone.
 

Overall - Would I come back?
=======================
I'll need a few more visits to get a better idea of their whole menu (THEIR MENU IS LIKE AN ENCYCLOPEDIA--so if you have problems deciding, you may want to bring someone to help you choose...). 

For now I'd say steer clear of their Japanese and Korean dishes to play it safe."}
{"text":"This Taiwanese cafe is so good, bringing every taste from Taipei, Taiwan.

We ordered iced fruit tea, taiwanese sausage and pork rice, okonomiyaki, salted fried chicken dice, grass jelly with taro and beans, matcha cheese tart, matcha mochi with red bean, as well as we ordered the most spicy sichuen potato noodle! 

Many choices from the a la carte menu for main, desserts, and drinks! Service is excellent from every server. This is our first time to visit this place. We would plan to come again shortly."}
{"text":"Nothing beats hot pot on a cold day and better yet this place has personal size for one so you can pick the flavor and toppings you like selection is good lots of hot spicy variety if that's your thing if you don't like hot pot don't worry lots of other selection like rice bowls noodles snacks and desserts I'm sure you can find something you like also I quite like the decor it's like nostalgic back in the days Taiwan with artifacts placed on the walls and around service is good place is clean and price is so so when we went when you pay cash it's 10% off will try again"}
{"text":"Long wait times and noisy environment. But the staff is quite nice and attentive after you wave them down. Fusion dishes with too many options on the menu so nothing stands out. Came here and both times my company and I only found the food items so so."}
{"text":"I will try to keep this short and be on point with this one.  Food \"looks\" better than it taste, drinks were not bad. I like the idea of the extensive menu, however I only ordered from the taiwanese food section, because all the japanese food on the menu didn't \"look\" authentic, therefore I avoided those pages. We ordered the sour & spicy glass noodle soup, no sour taste at all, all numbing spices which completely took over my palette and I wasn't able figure out the taste of the signature taiwanese hot pot we ordered...I just remember they had everything in it and the pork blood/pork intestines had a very strong smell to it. I like pork intestines on its own, but not in the same pot with the meat, clams, instant noodles, spam and veggies.  Maybe when you order, you may want to request them to put those on the side so it doesn't ruin the taste of the soup base.  Overall, service was slow but it's forgivable for a Saturday nighr, knowing that this place is still quite new. I would come back and try out their lunch sets.  The demographics at this place..high school teenagers hangout spot? Or a good spot for dates? Nice decor and seats are comfortable.  They also take reservations!!!"}
{"text":"The food is good (I just love traditional Taiwanese fried popcorn chicken). The service is good (They keep clearing your empty bowls and plates when finished with). But disposable chopsticks? Really? Please note that inside the menu, it states that if you take a picture of one of their dishes and immediately put it on social media, you are entitled to one free dessert or drink (worth $4.99 or less)."}
{"text":"I went with 3 other Taiwanese friends. We had a fantastic meal. Food was outstanding, waiters were nice, price is reasonable, service was quick. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Rating: 2.5
I was a little hesitant to come here and honestly speaking, I think I should've hesitated a little more LOL. I wouldn't say I had the worst time here, but it definitely wasn't good.

Like with what everyone has said so far about this place, they have a pretty big menu, one for desserts & drinks and another one for the actual meal. You want sizzling hot plates? MABU GOT CHU BOO. Spaghetti? MABU GOT CHU. HOTPOT? MABU GOT CHU. They really do have a variety of different things for you to try. 

I decided to go with the \"Roasted Meat Ball with Bolognese Sauce, Cheese and Garlic on Spaghetti\" and some kind of Korean Crushed Ice thing for dessert. GUESS TEH FK WHAAT?. They didn't have both of those things. Apparently their machine or oven was malfunctioning which was like WOW ok like I already waited a long time and they tell me like 20 minutes in that my stuff is non-existent. I was kind of in a hurry so I just went with the \"Grilled Angus Beef Steak with House Special BBQ Sauce on Rice\" and the \"Hokkaido Molten Cream Cheese Tart\". The rice was meh. I didn't really enjoy it at all tbh. The beef was hella chewy. It was almost like bubble gum and it kind of lacked flavour. I decided to pack it home and add in sriracha and that made it worse LOL (my fault but still very bland ish.) As for the dessert, it was pretty good. My only argument was that I found the tart part a lil too hard? I DID NOT GET THAT LAVA SPEWING OUT EFFECT THAT I WANTED. I CRY Oh and it was pretty expensive. $11.99 for two small tarts (just slightly bigger than your typical egg tart)

Service was okay. There were a couple of stand-out servers, others were pretty poopy. One of the servers (short hair girl you da woman) noticed we waited for a long time, checked on our stuff and even gave us free desserts (which was actually fking amazing ((milk puddingss?!)) LOL). Would I come back? Most likely not. The fact that they didn't have two of the things I wanted really disappointed me and their tea cups are just too damn weird. God damnit IKEA. HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO HOLD MY CUP COMFORTABLY??"}
{"text":"This place was quite busy for 9:30pm on a weekday night. I was surprised to see that there was a wait for tables. 

The menu here is large with many options. There is both a normal food menu and then a drinks and desserts menu. I ended up ordering Q13, Taiwanese Style Sliced Pork Chop w/ House Special Sauce ($10.99). 

It actually turned out that they had gave me the wrong dish (some chicken dish instead. I think it was the Taiwanese Style Pan Fried Chicken w/ Basil, Ginger, Onion on Rice) but I already ate some of the dish they gave me so they gave me my original dish for free. (Yes, yes, I know I should have been able to tell apart chicken and pork but then I wasn't really paying attention). 

I was actually happy that they gave me the wrong dish because the chicken dish tasted much better than the pork dish I originally ordered. The chicken was much more flavorful than the pork and wasn't dry like I found the pork to be. One small complaint I have about the chicken is that it had bones. It surely can't be that hard to have boneless chicken. 

A couple small things worth mentioning is that I thought the tables were a tad too close to each other and it was a bit loud in there.

There is a 10% discount if you pay in cash!

Overall not a bad place. I would come back here again to try the other dishes and definitely want to try one of the desserts next time."}
{"text":"?????????First Markham Place,?????????????????ok??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????3????????????????4-5???????d ."}
{"text":"Slow as shit service. Lost the order. Sat there for 45 mins before someone even noticed. The excuse they gave was that they were new and  very busy
 Really? People who came after us ate and left. Unbelievable. Avoid this place like the plague. There are so many more restaurants in this Plaza that are faster, better and cheaper. I would give zero stars if I could but I can't. Food is mediocre and expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"This is pretty much the same as Mabu Station near yonge and finch, except the line-up is crazy long at night. Waited for about 30 minutes to get a seat for just two people. We ordered the sweet potato brick toast and the matcha mochi waffle. Both are highly recommended! The mochi waffle tasted a lot better than expected and would love to try the other flavors! We didn't order food but the table next to us had some sort of hot-pot dish that looked SUPER good. I'd definitely come back to try the food.

Service is good despite the crowds. 

Recommended is to come earlier around 6-7pm if you want to avoid line-ups."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of my friends for dessert on a weekend evening. Even though there was a long line, the hostess was kind to check-in with my group to let us know how long the wait is and when our table will be ready. 

When we finally got seated to our table, I loved how they served us water, and not just any plain water, but water infused with lemon. I believe the lemon water is a great balance for the dessert; it's something sour to counter all the sugar being consumed. Also, I loved how they refilled your water throughout the night without your asking; I have been to some places where you have to ask multiple amount of times in order to get water. 

I ordered the rose milk tea and it was just delicious! Not only was the drink a perfect balance of the rose fragrance but I also loved how the milk foam was froathed just right. I highly recommend this drink!!

As a group we got the matcha red bean honey brick toast and the first bite was out of this world amazing and the next few bites were, \"ehhh, okay, I think I've had enough now.\" I kind of wished that the matcha flavour would be infused into the toast as it was just powder sprinkled on top. As well, with so much toast and only one scoop of ice cream on top, it was hard to divide amongst the five of us how much ice cream we all get. Nonetheless, I am extremely grateful that we shared this dessert, it is not a dish for one to conquer on their own--unless he/she happens to be very hungry. Between the five of us, we all had about 3-4 pieces of toast, which is pretty awesome!

The complementary milk pudding dessert was delicious; I personally enjoyed it more than the honey brick toast. Although the paper MABU icon was a bit off-putting as a friend thought it was white chocolate and almost put the paper in his mouth. I would caution for MABU to make sure everything that they put on the dish should be edible!

Aside from all this, would I return? MOST DEFINITELY!!"}
{"text":"Came here last night (Friday night) - and the wait was long! We waited for 45 mins for a table for two! As for the food, we ordered the creamy udon with smoked salmon and bacon, cheesy ribs with corn on rice, and korean sweet and spicy wings. The food was decent but not outstanding. The wings were not as crispy as I liked. Udon was nothing special. The cheesy ribs was tasty though, although a bit too salty. Staff were polite and always made sure my cup of water was full! Would I come back? Maybe."}
{"text":"first time here, we ordered the pork cutlet with the cheese ... and it came out raw inside. my girlfriend and i just thought it was cheese and didn't notice. the manager was hesitant at first but took it back and asked if we wanted a remake, of course, we didn't have the stomach for it. both our of stomachs felt a bit off that evening. she did take care of everything, we had ordered their popcorn chicken, which is very good here, not overly battered but perfectly crispy. wr got the minced beef rice instead. we ended up ordering a dessert too, the cheese cake, which was nice. the manager did not take care of the dessert which we found extremely odd. we didn't complain and paid. funny thing is that $10 is what took off the 3 stars. we did appreciate her taking care of the rest but the right thing to do would've been to take care of everything and anything we ordered, not that we took advantage of it. we have since returned here for other desserts. i did not appreciate it, it's simply not how you take care of your customers, especially when raw meat was served."}
{"text":"Lots of variety and it brings back a jiufen feel

Good place to try if you do not know what you are craving for since this place have a huge selection of dishes. 

There's always a line up for this place so be prepared to wait for a table."}
{"text":"Personally, I had a really good first experience at MABU. We came with our friends who have previously come here many, many times.

We were seated immediately. It was around 11:45 on a Thursday morning and the place was not as packed as I expected. There were definitely more empty seats - no wait times! The decor was very elegant and unique.

Our party of five ordered five dishes to share. The food came very quickly, which was impressive.

Japanese Style Salty Pancake - not a huge fan. The pancake was a bit plain and could've used more sauce.

Taiwanese Style Deep Fried Chicken Cutlet - I quite enjoyed this one! The chicken is fried like popcorn chicken, and it wasn't too oily or salty. The fries were very crisp and tasted like Costco fries (my fave).

House Special Cheese Pork Rib w/ Rice - loved it. The ribs were very savoury and the cheese, corn, and rice were a great combination.

Taiwanese Style Chicken w/ Basil, Ginger, Onion, Hot Pepper, Rice - I didn't eat much of this one but it was decent.

Taiwanese Style Hot Pot (I forgot which one specifically) - it was alright, but I've had better hotpots at home. The soup base was a little plain. Nothing special.

The food portions are definitely generous for the price, compared to other restaurants I've been to.

My brother and I also tried the Peach Green Tea/Black Tea and Oreo Milk Green Tea/Black Tea. I saw many people around us ordering drinks as well, but I found the price a bit hefty (~$5) for the size of the cup. The taste is comparable to that of bubble tea chains.

Overall, I had a great experience here. I'd definitely come back to try more of their hot plates or desserts (didn't have any this time)."}
{"text":"I went for dinner. The restaurant had nice ambiance. Service was quite good. Except for the fact that they gave me another table's order.

I ordered the Taiwanese beef noodle soup. Broth was nice and rich. A bit too salty for my taste. Beef chunks were a bit too chewy. Could have been cooked a bit longer. Noodles were nice and chewy. 

The menu itself for the restaurant is very simple. Rice, noodles, hotpot or sizzling hot plate.

Not much veggie dishes sadly. Just meat and carbs. 

Prices are a bit on the higher end of what I would pay for the same dishes somewhere else. 

I may come back again to try other dishes. But generously giving this restaurant a 3 of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Pros:
-Decor

Cons: 
-Slow service
-Tom yum udon was WAYYY too salty.
-Small food portions
-Long wait time, especially during rush periods(dinner, weekends)

Would not come here again."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend during the holidays and it was really busy. I've been meaning to come check it out. I was impressed with their menu. There was a wide range of items on it and it was hard to decide what to order. We settled with the udon and a sizzling plate. Both items were great ! Service was quick and friendly. I will come back to try more items from their menu."}
{"text":"Popcorn  is not add moist as it used to. Their egg wrap with pork really could be as good without pork. The one thing I definitely would not order again is the sweet potatoes toast. The thick toast was hard and dry. I wish they would just give me a thinner toast and added some sauce to soften the  a bit. Their hot fruit trees is too sweet. I would still come here again but no more toast related orders."}
{"text":"Came here after work.  Used to be packed like mad on a consistent basis, but I guess it was a Thursday and hence wait time was actually very short if not at all.  Had to be moved 10 mins in due to the fact there was a larger table was needed and it was really only my gf and I eating, but did not mind due to the fact we got sofa seats.  Environment was okay, nothing too extravagant, service was barely satisfactory, but what would you expect from a restaurant within the FMP plaza. 

It is a bit on the pricier side for chinese cuisine, but that is because you are paying a premium to access a lot of varieties of food and culture within their menus.  I ordered the original soup noodle, not much meat or vegetables, just really a big load of noodles, but soup was good.  Girlfriend got salmon with the egg roe on rice and she seemed to like it.  Overall, I will come here once a while, but definitely not something that you would be missing out if you missed it and definitely not worth the 1-2 hour wait sometimes on the weekend."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed with their food here tonight. I ordered the tom yum udon + beef sizzling rice. Their udon dish had an entire scoop of store bought tom yum flavouring that had not been completely mixed in well. Definitely not a recommendation. As for The sizzling beef it barely had  any flavour. Aka Teppan next door does a much better job."}
{"text":"Food is decent
Lots of room for improvements when it comes to service. We came at 5 pm with a majority of tables still available so we asked if we can sit at a booth. Server then said they haven't had time to arrange their reaervations and they need to hold the booths. Long story short, we were able to get a booth after the server said we have an hr and half to eat."}
{"text":"Came for dinner on a Friday and had to wait 30-40 minutes since MABU was packed. Enjoyed the unique House Special and Seafood, Milk & Cheese Taiwanese hot pots, which are just enough to fill one person each (don't be fooled by the photos on the menu) for $15-18. They have a good mix of ingredients and very flavourful soup bases. The Pork Jowl Don was also enjoyable but nothing special. 

The servers are friendly, though expect to wait for service when it is busy - especially if you sit in a corner table. Share a photo of your meal on any social media site for a free drink!"}
{"text":"My wife and two friends decided to try this place again. Not because we were disappointed the last time but there is an excitement about trying new dishes and Mabu Generation definitely has many visually appealing dishes that we keep coming back.  My wife and I have travelled to Taiwan 4 times in the last 2 years and miss the meaty and flavorful variety of cuisine. And we can't help compare local Taiwanese food with our experiences. That being said, the Chunked Beef noodle was actually very good. This is a bit of a challenge as the best chunked beef noodle is just a few stores down at Mei Nung noodle. But we were pleasantly surprised and will have this next time again.  Instead of the Suki yaki hotpot, we tried the Numbing Spice hotpot. It was very much comparable to the Numbing Spice flavor at other restaurants so it was mediocre but filling. Finally, I cannot emphasize enough the great service here. Customer's eat service and they understand that here. This was the first Asian restaurant where I received a customer service survey used to improve themselves. How could you not come here again."}
{"text":"Walking into here I was caught off guard by so many people saying Good Morning when I was there at night, kinda funny actually. 

But first things first, the menu to Mabu Generation is extensive and can be a little overwhelming when deciding on what you want to eat. 

I ended up getting the cheese udon noodle which has tobiko flakes, smoke salmon, bacon, chicken, seaweed, an egg, and mushrooms. The initial taste was very tasty with the cheese but towards the end it just got very salty with the smoke salmon and bacon. 

Service wasn't too bad. I was there with a group of 13 people and one of the servers checked up on us and made sure we were okay and asked if we needed anything else. 

I'd probably come back a few more times to try out other items since their menu is pretty big."}
{"text":"Mabu Generation! So much hype for this place located at First Markham Place. We had to wait 15-20 minutes for a seat. I don't think it was that bad of a wait considering we never reserved a table in advance. Service was okay. It was hard to flag a server to order our meal, but it was understandable because it was so busy during dinner time.

Reading the menu was like reading an instruction manual.. There were SO many options on the menu. It's great that there are options but it took us a good 15 minutes to pin down our first 3 items to order haha.

** Tidbit! ** You will receive a freebie dessert or $6.99 worth of drinks if you post a photo of their food promoting their restaurant.

GRILLED BEEF TONGUE WITH SEA SALT & BLACK PEPPER (3/5)
The flavour and texture was great. The 2 points is lacking because it came COLD! It was probably sitting there in the kitchen for a while.. It isn't supposed to be a cold dish!

GRILLED RICE BALL WITH BUTTER, SALMON & PORK (4/5)
Recommending this! This dish came sizzling hot. The outside crust was very crispy and the rice in the inside was nice and soft. The rice had a teriyaki flavour, which was delicious.

BAKED SEAFOOD WITH AVOCADO & CHEESE (1/5)
It sounds yummy right?! That's what I thought until I tried it. Omg don't order this. I'm a huge fan of avocados and I don't usually hate its taste but I don't know what went wrong with this combination.

OKONOMIYAKI (4/5)
I liked this! Lots of flavour - it  came sizzling hot. There's a mix of egg, pancake, Japanese okonomiyaki sauce and bonito flakes. It was a seafood filled okonomiyaki with shrimp, calamari and imitation crab.

JAPANESE STYLE CURRY PORK CHOP ON RICE (4/5)
The flavour of the curry pork cutlet was okay but I'm giving this a high score because I think it's worth the money. The portion is really big. You can share this amongst two people. Side dishes as part of the curry pork cutlet rice includes salad with sesame sauce, ketchup and fries.

JAPANESE STYLE SUKIYAKI HOT POT (3/5)
This hot pot came with sliced beef, meat ball, cuttlefish ball, fish tofu, imitation crab stick, kamaboko, rice cake, tofu, onion, sliced white turnip, nappa (veggie), enoki mushroom, cabbage, corn, mushrooms and udon. The mishap that came with this dish was that they didn't give us the udon noodles.. Good thing we remembered! The taste of the soup isn't too strong, if you're looking for something sweet and light tasting then I'd recommend this one."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch after seeing the $10.99 lunch specials posted on their window.  Love the atmosphere of the restaurant when you walk in.  It's like old school Asian decor with vintage movie posters and ads.  As you walk in, all staff will welcome you (similar to how you're treated at a Japanese restaurant).  They serve Taiwanese cuisine fused with Japanese ingredients.  It's pretty unique.  Service wasn't great but that's probably because everyone was still new.  Food portion was generous and pretty delicious.  I ordered the House Special Stir Fried Chicken with Spicy and Sour Sauce on rice.  It came with a salad which I must say was horribly executed - I think the choice of cabbage for the salad was a big mistake.  It also came with your choice of black or green tea (with optional bubbles and milk) as well as dessert which was a milk pudding.  I'm definitely going back again for the popcorn chicken, the table beside us ordered it and it looks pretty darn good."}
{"text":"There's a lot of hype for this place but I don't feel their desserts really deliver... We tried the marshmallow with the ice cream center, milk pudding, waffles, and the mochi.

To start, the water tastes like bleach or chlorine. 

The mochi wasn't soft or fluffy.. Just really chewy and the only thing you can taste is whatever powder is sprinkled on top. The waffles were made of tapioca like dough so it feels very under cooked and extra chewy.. not a fan. Doesn't do anything for the flavor. The marshmallow looks interesting but it was so chewy it made it a little gross. I expected something melty and sticky and a delicious toasted marshmallow flavor with yummy ice cream in the middle. It was not that. It was a thick \"marshmallow\" shell made of what I think is more tapioca mix with so little ice cream in the middle.. tastes like nothing...

The milk pudding was okay. The flavors are not strong enough. Congee Queen and Kenny's noodles does it way way better! 

I will say, the service is quick and friendly despite the horrible food. The food is so over priced and not that great. Keep in mind, I only had the desserts. 

Seriously would not be back."}
{"text":"This is descent place to dine in. Is it the most Taiwanese representative restaurant in Toronto, not likely, that said its good as a stand alone restaurant I would categorize as more fusion with select Taiwanese ingredients. Admittedly, my taste buds have been spoiled as I spent over 15 years in Taiwan which is often noted as a  jewelled food haven in south east Asia. 

It's obvious that the owner invested a lot in the decor as the space is well lit, artistic, vibrant, and well renovated. Do expect to wait as there is often a lineup and packed. The space is really nice for drinks be it non alcoholic or alcoholic. The service is attentive and they do clear your table or refill your water without having to chase down servers. They don't rush you out to increase their table turnover. Would give a 4 Star for space, location, ambiance, and service. That said, the food would be 3. My pork for the curry pork cutlet was very dry and even though it came on a skillet mine was luke warm while my friends came out sizzling. Consistency is key. The hot pot is really yummy and soup base flavourful. Dishes are a hit and miss so try your luck navigating through that huge menu of theirs. Price point is reasonable ranging from $10 to 18 a dish, drinks at $6. 

Overall would recommend as I have been here more than a handful of times."}
{"text":"Had to wait 30 min for a seat on a weekend , so be prepared ! I ordered takoyaki which was actually really good and the bubble tea was okay as well . The pork chop cutlet (cheese filled) Just didnt meet my standards , it was hard to cut through ; over cooked . I wanted to order something else but they didn't have curry , that was a bit disappointing.Food came in a timely manner , good place to come if you live in the local . Overall a bit pricey but still a good restaurant."}
{"text":"MABU has an insane menu and is borderline overwhelming deciding what to eat. Their dessert menu can truly satisfy any sweet cravings. Everything from grass jelly bowls to hot marshmallow toast - MABU's got it!"}
{"text":"Nice environment.  Lots of food & dessert selection.  Could use more hot drink selection.  Staff speaks English, Cantonese, & Mandarin.  Came here around 10pm on a Sunday night.  They ran out of this chicken hot pot thing I wanted.. Will return to try that.  Drinks were fairly normal drinks that u can get at other bubble tea places.  U can also get alcoholic drinks here which is a nice touch.  Bathrooms were clean.  Restaurant seemed pretty clean.  Service was pretty good."}
{"text":"I wanted to come here after being told how good and busy they always are so I finally made the trip and came with a friend. The place was super full for a Wednesday night and people even had reservations; if you have a large party with you, you should definitely call. For a table of two, we had to wait maybe 10min which wasn't bad. 

We ordered the Korean style hot pot, the Cheese Hashbrown Egg Pancake and the Taiwanese Popcorn Chicken and Waffles (food came out in that order). I was really excited about the hot pot because I had that dish in California for the first time last year and waited for something like that to show up here. Their menu is massive. They have to have a separate book for their desserts and drinks. Lots of options!

The hot pot was ok, it was just a standard hot pot meal and it's a little smaller than expected but we were able to have 3-4 half bowl scoops each. It was kind of spicy and I enjoy spicy foods. The two sauces that came with it were some sweet and spicy paste and the other was a dried spicy paste--the latter was super spicy! We didn't use any because the soup was spicy enough. Also our fire went out halfway through our meal, I know the flame probably is supposed to go out but we had half our meal left so we asked for another. However warning, getting another flame accelerant means that by the end of the meal, the soup becomes much thicker as all the water has evaporated. 

The Cheese Egg Pancake was quite good too but very simple. In our opinion it was a bit expensive for the ingredients, but maybe the price reflects how good they executed it. It's literally a hashbrown wrapped in egg and a sweet and spicy sauce wrapped in a Chinese green onion pancake. Good appetizer dish. I guess all I'll say is it's surprisingly good. 

Lastly we got their Taiwanese Chicken and Waffles which can be found in their dessert menu. It comes with a small dipping bowl of maple syrup and it also came with a few slices of fruit--one which I'm allergic to but didn't know they would put it on (kiwi). I was ok with that, I don't usually see kiwi as the fruit of decorating choice often and I saw kiwi in their other desserts so it shouldn't have been a surprise. Learn from past mistakes and always alert your server of your allergies when you order! We wanted to try their popcorn chicken and we saw that there was the option to have it in a dessert which was awesome. It came with a nice Dijon mustard and relish sauce drizzled on top. The waffle was cut into four pieces and tastewise I thought it was pretty good, it was a completely sweet waffle though, not savoury like other chicken and waffle dishes. It was a nice option to dip the waffle and chicken into the maple syrup, if you haven't tried fried chicken and maple syrup I recommend you trying it if you like sweet and savoury tastes! Although I'm sure if you didn't you wouldn't be ordering this dish anyways. 

Overall good service, very clean and when we paid for some reason we got 10% off and we couldn't figured out why but it was nice. My only complaint was that I could taste the bleach in their cups from drinking the water. The taste was so strong that I didn't want to drink the water, but the hot pot had made me so thirsty that I had to drink water, so I just held my nose while drinking it. That put me off a bit. @MabuGeneration please rinse your cups more thoroughly!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food. We ordered the Seafood Hot Pot and it was very good. Good quality & fresh ingredients. We would come back here for drinks & hot pot again. Only costs $15-16/person for hot pot, good portions and very tasty."}
{"text":"Came here for dessert and dinner with a group of 4 . Reading from other reviews , we made sure to make reservations ( make sure you make them before 5pm or else they won't let you reserve ) Arrived around 7:30pm and was seated within 5 minutes. 
Overall was satisfied with their service and food for dinner. The waitress kept coming around to refill water .  We ordered the matcha red bean Millie cake with ice cream (12.99) which was very bland and you couldn't taste the matcha or the red bean. It was very fluffy though. Also ordered the A11 chocolate molten cheese cake , which we could only taste chocolate and was very hard to cut into the crust/shell. For food , we ordered the M07 Japanese curry corn teriyaki chicken katsu (12.99) and it was amazing. The chicken was crispy and juicy , the curry was sweet and a little spicy but just right , it mixed very well with the rice and was still hot after 2 hours !  Mabu also offers a pork chop version of it and the pork chop is a lot drier. The Japanese black pepper teriyaki beef(12.99) was very sweet but went well with the rice and was not too overpowering. Only complaint I could have is that they used peppercorns and some of them were not ground up properly , so sometimes you get a mouthful of pepper. The salmon bacon cheese and cream pasta was mouth watering  , the sauce was delicious. It is sweet and creamy with a hint of white wine taste to it , the pasta was aldente and the salmon was just the right amount. It tasted a little strange with the seaweed on top , but overall worth trying ! (12.99)"}
{"text":"Horrible representation of Taiwanese food. I know they are trying to be fusion, but gosh was the food horrible. The only reason I'm giving it an extra star is because the staff there were friendly.  Seating was comfortable. The restaurant was nicely decorated. I won't go back for the food. Maybe, and only maybe will try their dessert coz we didn't have it that time."}
{"text":"Came in at 12:30am on a Sunday night and the lady tells me that they've already passed their last call and they will only serve drinks.  Last I checked, they close at 2am.  We came all the way from Scarborough and were denied proper service.  Hence the one star review."}
{"text":"MABU is the place where you'd take 30 minutes to decide on something to get lol. They have 3 separate menus that have drinks, food, and desserts - which they don't tell you which is which so it makes it that more fun. Their ambiance is awesome, very casual with fairly nice servers.

Something to note: MABU doesn't accept any reservations on holidays or weekends. And when you are there, expect a 15-30 minute wait for a table  

Other than that, it's a nice place to hang out with friends, maybe get a couple drinks (a tall boy of beer is $6, not bad) and share a huge plate of fries OR some BBT and dessert. Options are endless lol"}
{"text":"Mabu Generation is a Japanese and Taiwanese restaurant located in the First Markham Place Plaza. Of the two times that I visited, it was pretty busy. The decor in the restaurant has a modern and rustic look. The service was excellent other than the language barriers with some of the servers there. Like most Japanese restaurants , Mabu's employees all greet you very loudly when you come in and thank you very loudly when you leave. 

The food there is beautifully presented, especially their desserts. I was quite impressed with the toast towers. We had the Mango Toast Tower w/ Mango and Ice Cream on top. The toast was toasty and crispy on the outside and warm and moist on the inside. It really dissolved in your mouth. Both times that I visited, I ordered hot pot dishes. I preferred the House Special Hot Pot over the Taiwanese Style Chitterling Hot Pot. Just a piece of advice, a lot of the Taiwanese dishes has a spice to it that makes your mouth numb. So don't be alarmed if you come across this tingling sensation if you encounter it. Overall a pretty great place to try out for a different experience. JimStar Out!!"}
{"text":"Waited in line for 45mins with lots of empty table available. Untrained hostess ignored the line up and always get distracted with other customers. No clue on how to prioritize the customer on the line. This organization need trained management and I would not recommend to anybody unless you want to wait for hours while looking at those empty tables. Food is average ! 
First experience would not get me back !"}
{"text":"This review is just based on dessert and drinks. It was a long weekend and I was craving for something cold and sweet. We were headed to the cups, but it was closed  and we ended up at Mabu. There was a quite a line up so I had higher expectations. The menu was extensive and we ended up ordering the Matcha cheesecake, black sesame milk tea and Oreo milk tea. Nothing to write home about. I've had better. I might come back to try their mains but the prices are a bit higher for a place like that."}
{"text":"First time visiting this place, and honestly their menu was a bit overwhelming. There's too much to choose from and hard to narrow down exactly what you want, because many items are similar. 

We ordered a deep fried tofu with garlic sauce, Taiwanese style oyster omelette, Taiwanese style popcorn chicken and a seafood, milk & cheese hot soup. They were all very tasty, except for the oyster omelette (too much flour and not a lot of oyster). 
The hot soup was a big hit for us, the soup base was creamy and has a nice favour to it. 

I'd definitely come back, and try out other dishes!"}
{"text":"I have been to Mabu Station once and have never been back.  A bad first impression and Mabu Station has been out of sight out of mind.  I haven't had any expectations when I come here, but the decor, service and food are way better than Mabu Station.  Their menu is extensive; it's so extensive that my friends and I had all got lost.  We had to ask our server for \"direction\".  She suggested a few things, and we picked two things from their lunch menu which came with drink and dessert.  We also got some appetizers and Korean style grilled marshmallow stuffed with ice cream.  The pork intestines with sweet and sour sauce is full of flavor, but the dessert that came with it was a teeny weeny piece of warabimochi (Japanese sweet dumpling).   Beef with noodle in soup and the appetizers are mediocre. The dessert  is extremely good, but $4.99 for a piece is a bit pricy though.   Great service!"}
{"text":"M05 sizzling plate was not sizzling. Plate was still hot enough to cook the thinly sliced beef but lacked the sizzle with the steak. As every salesman would know the SIZZLE IS AS IMPORTANT AS THE STEAK.  Mabu sold the SIZZLING hot plate with no sizzle delivered. I'm sizzling mad.

H06 hot pot was tasty. I enjoyed the soup and extra chewy vermicelli.

Q10 for minced pork on rice was nothing close to the signature Taiwanese dish I had in Taiwan. There was an egg with it, that seemed like it was supposed to be runny but wasn't bc it was too cooked. Had some pickled vegetables that I'm not sure should have been there. The pork wasn't as fatty and the sauce was a bit off.

T20 dessert molten matcha green cheese tart or something. This was delicious.  GET IT.

Service - acceptable level of friendliness and came over an adequate number of times, but a tad slow due to the sheer volume of customers.

Get a free drink when you post a food pic here but it's limited to only one per table. God damn it. This cost you one star for not stating this detail in the ad in your menus. Should be one per unique user who posts.

Decor - newly renovated and ambience is nice . Girls feel comfortable here.

Not worth the 40 min wait on Friday night. But can consider it for a place to eat if theres no line up.

Value - 2.5/5"}
{"text":"Wasn't a big fan of their meals- I've tried their Taiwanese pork rice, noodles, and hot pot. It's not authentic Taiwanese pork rice- a lot of oil - would not recommend anyone to get that.

There's often a line - so be prepared to wait. Aesthetically it's super pretty and nice."}
{"text":"Opens late which makes it my top choice when looking for a sweet craving fix! Their drinks are amazing no matter what you get but also their desserts are massive! I haven't tried the food yet but is on my list to dos. It looks so good every time I pass by other customers. Recommended!"}

Hi and welcome to another episode of javing it with Javier. Let's see what we are javing today. Today we are trying their fried rice, Korean seafood instant noodles with cheese, and their Japanese pork cutlet curry. Oooo the menu photos look really good I'm excited to try. Let's dive right into the review.

Trying the pork cutlet, it tasted slightly overcooked. The curry on the other hand was not bad. The fries were very dissapointing; I can do better popping no name frozen fries into the toaster oven. Moving onto the seafood Korean noodles. The taste was overwhelming and they were way too oily. Not to say that there was barely any seafood in it. Lastly the fried rice. Sighz this rice lacked flavour and was pretty much soaked in oil. Dissapointment all around.

Value wise the food was overpriced. Not only were the noodles salty, I am too. With the lack of seafood, they should've just labelled it overpriced Korean noodles. 

Yet another place we had to ask staff to pour out water; one of my greatest pet peeves. 

Overall this place was filled with dissapointment and I would suggest everybody to save themselves a night of dissapointment too! And that's it for today's episode of javing it with Javier. And remember food is life."}
{"text":"Actually 3.5 stars. 

I came here around 9pm on a Monday night. They were packed and we had to wait for a seat. They have an extensive menu along with pictures of each item which I liked. 

I ordered Taiwanese style chicken with rice on a sizzling plate ($12). The portions were good and the plate came HOT. I had to let it sit a bit before I was able to bite into the food. I liked the sauce they had with the chicken. My only complaint is that the chicken was not boneless. It isn't hard to debone meat.   

In terms of service, it was a bit difficult to flag down a waiter/waitress to take our order paper and to get the bill. However, they were great at keeping our glasses full. They also messed up our order but they apologized and let us keep the wrong dish free of charge.   

I would come back to try their other menu items.  

10% off if you pay in cash."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now and overall I find that they're food is pretty good. Certain items on the menu do seem pricey for the portions that they give you. 

Additionally, it would be nice if the sizzling hot plates were actually hot and sizzling instead of just warm. It was quite disappointing when I was presented with a non-sizzling plate of rice. 

But overall, I like their interior design, there was an adequate amount of service, and they have a large menu. 

P.S. - you get 10% off for paying in cash! :)"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. I enjoy the variety of desserts they offer and the service is good. During our time there, they always check if we require water refill. Expect a line up, esp on Friday n saturday night. 

My recommendation for dessert: red bean matcha icecream mochi chewy waffles ($10.99) - the pairing of mochi n waffle are great together 

Do not get: Korean style grilled marshmallow stuffed w ice cream ($6.99) - looks and sounds cool but tasted nothing special and definitely not worth $7"}
{"text":"We came here at 10:30pm hoping there will be Sears available.  Surprisingly...It's pack with people.  Luckily we found a seat.  We ordered braised beef noodle soup and ice cream toast desert.  The food came out fast and server was friendly to hand out the dishes.  In the menu, they said the beef noodle soup is there signature house dish.  It taste alright but I think it can improve because I ate at other restaurant which is better.  The desert is huge in portion and it taste good.  Can't finish by 1 person.  The atmosphere here is great there and lots of food to order from the menu.  It's worth paying a visit."}
{"text":"If I could do NO star rating and leave a comment, I would, it's just terrible experience I had this time and I've been to this location many times now, very disappointed.

Went here for lunch on Friday at around 1:30pm, don't think they had enough staffs or their staffs need more training to work more efficiently coz we were given a number although there were obviously tables available that just needs to be cleaned. We were giving a number and had to wait, but there was at least the table right by the entrance that was available but just needed cleaning up. Then as we waited, 3-4 groups of people were done eating and left the store, and 2-3 groups of new customers came in, and again, all were given numbers to wait... I guess by this time they see a crowd of people standing by the door, yet the restaurant was half empty (coz people left already) so THEN they decided to clean up some tables for new customers to sit down...
The food was ok, but we ordered a bowl of plain steam rice with a waiter, we waited 10 mins and still no rice, so I asked another waitress if he had placed the order, she verified on the computer that the order was placed and left. Then it was another 7 mins STILL. No rice, I asked yet another waitress to check on the status since we've now been waiting at least 15 mins to have just a bowl of steam rice, she apologized and went into the kitchen immediately and got us the rice right away...
If they had told us that each bowl of steam rice was made to order, then the 15 minutes would make sense, but I know they're not, and to wait 15 minutes or more for a plain bowl of steam rice, this is great efficiency and excellent service.
Food wise I think all these bubble tea places are about the same, I don't mind waiting if all tables are occupied, but when you don't hire enough staffs and make customers wait coz tables aren't cleaned, that's unreasonable.
I know minimum wage increased, but charging $18 for a tower of thicker looking toasts with some syrup and ONE scoop of ice cream, I honestly think you make enough profit to hire more staffs..."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both experiences were good. The service was fast and the staff was very friendly. 

They have a lot of choices on the menu but some items that my friends ordered didn't taste great but some did. The desserts are all pretty good. I would come back for the desserts."}
{"text":"I don't understand MABU Generation, maybe I'm not from that generation? I don't know why this establishment seem so popular. My understanding is that they sell bubble teas, desserts, and taiwanese western fusion foods.

Nothing I drank or ate there wow me at all. The drinks are usually too sweet with little of other flavours. The dessert is just typical of this kind of dining places. Just deep fry a thick piece of bread like french toast then add crap loads of ice cream, sugary syrups, and lots of butter. Of course it'll taste great! Just might get a heart attack, but that's just an afterthought. The food is mediocre as well. I love taiwanese food, but this rates pretty low on my list. 

Problem is I think they tried to be so many things at the same time but I don't think they've achieve any of it. Confused, I continue to see long lines when I visit with my friends (who choose to come here). Please enlighten me somebody and open my eyes to what I can not see.

{"text":"A very large variety of food which can be good when you and your friends can't make up your mind.
They have a lot of hot pot/ teppan style foods which can make the place very odorous without the proper ventilation. So if you go be sure to expect to shower after or you'll be smelling like bbq for days.

Food is okay. And generally it is a good place to sociallize. I would think this is more of a place for teens and early 20s crowd."}
{"text":"Food portions were tiny, and taste was less than mediorce, so value certainly wasnt there.

We ordered four things:

1. Spicy chicken with rice - chicken was dry and chewy, it was not spicy, and the whole plte was barely warm. The white rice that came with it was the best part; and it was actually hot!

2. Spaghetti with cheese - it is what it is, it was good. Ikea meatballs were better.

3. Hokkaido cheese tarts - yums! this was really good but also really tiny; pretty pricey for $11.99 for 2

4. Milk tea - also yums!

Would return for more desserts but not for dinner."}
{"text":"Tried this place out twice once for lunch and other time for dinner. Both experiences were not very good. Lets start with the lunch experience. Ordered the popcorn chicken with rice and a drink. The chicken was pretty bad. It really seemed like they had just took out frozen chicken from the freezer and deep fried it and seasoned it afterwards. Tasted quite terrible. 

Dinner was not any better either. I ordered R12 ( forgot the name of the dish) and that wasn't any good. It had a pepper on the side so of course it's a spicy dish. What I didn't know was that, that item came cold. It's essentially a cold noodle dish. They didn't mention that on the description. And it was overally spicy too. I am able to eat spicy food but that was not the sort of spice that I enjoyed. It felt like they just sprinkled a ton of chili and cayyenne pepper on top of the noodles which just gives the noodles a spicy flavor but it's so overpowering. Also the kind of noodles they give doesn't soak any of the spice it just drops to the bottom of the bowl. Cold noodles also doesn't help absorb the spice so it felt like almost eating a spice ball and your entire mouth is on fire. Just a bad mixture of cold and hot elements. 

I would never order that dish again R12 is pretty horrendous, and I wouldn't recommend anyone ordering it either.  Overall, the food at this place is quite poor. Not good quality, either things are too salty, spicy, or not made with any quality ingredients.  Service is fine but the food really lacks and does not taste good."}
{"text":"Some dishes were pretty good and some dishes really weren't very good at all so it's really hard to decide on a rating. I give it a 3 because of this. 

The space itself looks nice and even though the place was packed, service was decent, just have to wait a bit. 

Menu is pretty big one for appetizers and meals and one for desserts and drinks. We ordered a few items and here's what's good and what's not:

GOOD
- grilled ox tongue
- popcorn chicken (tasty and huge portion)
- fruit tea (slightly too sweet but very flavourful)
- french fries (it came with some of the items we ordered)

NOT SO GOOD
- cheese filled pork cutlets (tasted like cheeze whiz inside and wasn't like what I was expecting)
- Japanese curry pork cutlet with rice (this curry was very very bad. DONT just don't do it)
- Taiwanese sausage (these were big but too lean and not fatty enough)
- Traditional grass jelly (the grass jelly has ribbed can marks so I'm guessing it came from a can. It was soft though so still decent but I didn't know there was coconut jelly inside. It just said jelly on the menu. The coconut flavour overpowered everything and I don't even like coconut flavour. Totally ruined the entire dish for me)

As you can see it's a 50/50 split. They also have individual hot pot which looked good (I was checking out my neighbour's food after some of my dishes disappointed). Maybe next time when it's super chilly I'll give this place another go. 

Prices were decent. It was out to $85 after taxes."}
{"text":"We came in recently on a whim - it was a cold day in MAY (notice my caps lock - thanks El Nino/Nina/global warming/mother nature), and we were really hoping for hot pot.  We stumbled in here b/c there was a bit of a lineup and we were wondering what the hype was. 

We got in pretty quickly b/c we were only two people and we both ordered one of those individual hot pots.  I had the original hot pot w/ a broth, sukiyaki, and fish balls and the bf had a spicy one.  They were both good but not mind-blowingly good.  Overall, we were satisfied by the meal.  

We had a melting lava cake for dessert that consisted of a matcha cake outlayer and cheesecake molten lava inside.  That was quite delicious - I would encourage you to try it but it DOES take 20 minutes to make!  

Overall, a cute concept - would totally come back here."}
{"text":"+.5 for service

So...I'm back home for a couple of weeks, and needless to say in the 3 months I've been gone, a lot of new restaurants opened. I decided to give this place a try after my parents tried this place and told me good things about it.

Mabu Generation is located in First Markham Place, at the particular unit that seems to have a high turnover. Hopefully this place is here to stay, cause it was quite busy on a Friday night at 10pm.

The menu is very extensive, ranging from Taiwanese snacks to Japanese delicacies to dessert to drinks...you name it. It would obviously take several visits for me to get a sense of what's good and what's not in here...regardless I tried some items for my first visit.

I had the deep fried tofu with garlic sauce, black pepper teriyaki sauce rice on hot plate, lamb with pickled cabbage hot pot, hokkaido molden cream cheese tart, and an oreo milk green tea. Good variety of choices for my first round to give an analysis of this place.

The deep fried tofu with garlic sauce was average; it was the garlic sauce that made the difference in my opinion, as the deep fried tofu wasn't anything memorable at all. The rice on hot plate was very good; definitely at least on par with Aka Teppan nearby. The hot pot was also good, and it's not your typical hot pot as the sauce and ingredients were put inside before it arrives. The cream cheese tart, however, was a letdown as the tart itself was burnt and it was too hard to chew. Finally, the oreo milk tea was decent but nothing spectacular.

Service was good, however do give the employees a bit of time, especially if the place is busy. It's quite a big restaurant and they seem to be understaffed quite a lot.

If I end up coming back before I go back to Winnipeg in the new year, I'll update this review with more items."}
{"text":"Probably a 2.5. The ambience is nice and cozy. Average bubble tea and dessert joint. They do offer a wide variety of items on the menu but every time i go to a new bubble tea joint... I always order two things. basic black milk tea and their most popular and most recommended dessert (their Sakura cake ruined it all. Looks pretty but it tastes like nothing. if i have to put a taste to it... it would be like cardboard. texture was pretty damn weird because the cake itself was jello like but they topped it with a powdered cracker type of topping. so it was kinda dry and then you just have this jiggly thing they call a cake... I was beyond confused). The black milk tea was pretty average. not bad but i would probably visit again for the tea and maybe try the food. The fried tofu cubes thing was also pretty darn weird. I wouldn't suggest ordering that unless you're a die-hard tofu fan..."}
{"text":"Except the personal hotpot options, other choices are just ok, especially the dessert, expensive but taste no surprise."}
{"text":"We ordered Okonomiyaki fries as our appetizer, seafood & tofu hot soup with vermicelli
and Japanese style black pepper teriyaki sauce on sliced beer w/rice on sizzling hot plate as our main. If you share their food on social media, you can get either a free pudding or any drink within the $4.99 range. We asked if we could pay the difference for the mango milk snow shake with fresh mango and sago and they agreed (totally recommend it, it was really good. Though, we waited over 20 mins for the drink. We got it when we almost finished our meal). Also, if you pay cash, you can get an extra 10% off. Overall, the food and everything was quite good. There is a wait though, approximately 45 mins to an hour for us so we were browsing their menu. They have a really wide range of food from Asian fusion appetizers to hot sizzling plates to mini hot pots to desserts. I would definitely come back because there are still so much on the menu that caught my attention and want to try."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place since I like mabu station! Service was fast and super friendly. I like their atmosphere and music. Their food was good, my friend and I had mussels, popcorn chicken, bolognese cheese meatball spaghetti, pork cutlet with rice and their oyster omelette!"}
{"text":"A friend had recommended coming to this place for dinner so we decided to try it. We made reservations in advance so the wait time was not too bad. When we got there at 7pm the place was packed already with many people waiting in line. We waited an extra 5 minutes as well for our reservation as they had to clear the table.

I liked the interior and the overall atmosphere of this place. It is quite loud and busy as well. Flipping through the menu for the first time I was surprised by the variety of menu items that they had.

*Taiwanese style mini hot pot*
As it was a cold winter day I decided to try the Taiwanese style mini hot pot and it did not disappoint! I was hesitant to order it at first because the portions looked like it was meant for sharing but there is actually the perfect amount (not too much and not too little)

The hotpot that I tried was the sweet kind and it is called the Japanese style Sukiyaki hotpot. I ordered it mainly because it comes with udons. It came with a raw egg on the side with some flavourful sauce that you can add to cook in your pot. I was really happy with the ingredients that they added. The beef rolls were fresh, cabbage was naturally sweet, and the portions of fishballs, crab, and turnip were quite generous as well. I like this kind of hotpot because all the ingredients are already pre-arranged with the perfect amount. The presentation was great as well.

We also tried a milky custard cube dessert and it was good and not too sweet. The service was good and they were attentive but because there are so many people lining up they may try to kick you out after 2 hours. Would come back to try the other types of menu items"}
{"text":"The menu here is quite overwhelming but nonetheless, I'll have to come here a few more times to try everything out! Mabu has a combination of everything - taiwanese classic dishes, personal hotpot, boiled seafood, sizzling plate items, fusion pasta, bubble tea, asian desserts, etc. The place was quite busy when I arrived so to begin with, you will need to set the expectation that there might be a wait. For the night, we opted for the personal hot pot and although it is quite pricey, I thought they gave a generous amount of food. The hot pot was quite a lot of food for me so although I was expecting to eat dessert, I had to opt out. Overall, service wasn't bad but I found that some servers didn't speak English very well so communication was a bit hard. However, I'm excited to come back next time and try out everything given my first impression has been good. Also, look out for the free drink/dessert if you post a picture on social media that is somewhere on the menu. (:"}
{"text":"Place was too noisy for me.  Menu selection is  great but not all items are actually available.  The pepper and garlic beef with rice on  teppan was  very  flavourful,  actually better than that at  Aka Teppan next door.  The  clear broth beef noodle soup was  also  good.  The  noodle was nice.   The bakes yoghurt was awesome. Place  clean.  Service prompt and courteous."}
{"text":"Brand new expansion location to their Yonge and Finch establishment, Mabu carries its tradition of good taste and good price to Markham. You'll be reading the menu for a long long time because there's SO MANY items that you'll want to eat. At this location they've added cocktails too!

The whole place embodies fusion entirely. The decor feels like Moxies meets dessert house. The music is a nice jazzy lounge vibe but it crisscrosses with a traditional Chinese hand painted mural and a lot of old school Chinese posters in the washroom.

All in all it's a place I know I'll visit often for food, dessert, drinks and cocktail."}
{"text":"Absolutely love it here. Came for the first time and we were overwhelmed by the variety. They have so much to choose from. Ordered the hot pot and the soup was amazing. We got the house special with ramen. We also got the eel, mushroom and cheese on rice in a stone bowl and flavour was awesome. The portion was just a little too small. May not even be enough for a person if you have an appetite. Friend got the Chinese pancake burrito and it was decent. We also got the mango toast tower thing to share. One of the best desserts I've ever had. Toast was crunchy even after being drenched in mango syrup and whip. I would definitely want to go back and try their other flavours."}
{"text":"This was seemed unique when I was doing some research for dinner with a couple of friends. We saw personal sized hot pots and thought \"wow cool!\" Since not all of us are hot pot fans. Nonetheless, there were so much food to choose from, in a way, it was nice if you want the variety but at the same time, if you're indecisive, you'll be in a lot of trouble! The food itself was good however, nothing to brag about. The service was lacking a bit... I remember them taking a while to come help us when we were trying to grab someone's attention... someone's water glass wasn't as clean as they should have been... on that note, cleanliness was ok overall, minus the cup incident."}
{"text":"Never been to this restaurant before, and it surprise me quite well, the place is nice, menu is easy to understand and lots of choices. I chose some snack and dessert. You need to fill in the order form yourself and then pass it to the server. Shortly after the server will print out a order sheet to double check with you. Once everything confirm, the food came pretty quick. The snack was average but the dessert was good. I know is dessert but I don't like it too sweet, somehow they manage the sweetness pretty well and I like it. It is kinda experience so it deduct one star, I will still come back but just not so often because I can't afford."}
{"text":"Visited this place twice for lunch with my girlfriend.

Food: Fancy!  They look fantastic, everything looked nice and it wasn't messy at all.  Pricey. It's all really more expensive than I'd expect it to be.  My girlfriend got a small hotpot and the creamy egg dessert, totaling $30.  That's a lot for a lunch.  Taste was up and down.  The hotpot had a strong flavour and quantity of preserved veggies... but that takes up a lot of space in there.  It makes it hard to enjoy the limited amount of meat that's there.  I got some popcorn chicken with rice, which was okay - I think I'd prefer more chicken in them.

During our first visit, we had too many problems.  We got wings and there was a LOT of batter with very little actual meat inside.  I got udon noodles and they were grossly undercooked.  My girlfriend got noodles, which were called \"udon with shrimp\".  Problem was they had eel and fish on it as well.  There was no mention on it and my girlfriend doesn't like either of the two 'added' ingredients.  Needless to say, both of us ate very little that meal.

The service is decent.  The servers are generally pretty nice.  It's hard to tell if they're rushed or just really hard working, but they move around pretty fast.  I'm not sure how my order (my popcorn chicken) on the second visit came cold.  The waitress didn't seem to want to replace it either.  They had to get the manager, which was more than willing to, which was good.  I'm not sure if they need authorization to replace it or what, but this seems like an unnecessary extra step.  Also worth mentioning is that they gave me my udon (on my first) for free after I told them it was undercooked, but this was shortly after they opened - so many they were just trying to be lenient.

The place itself is a good size given the plaza it's in, the place is pretty cozy and the atmosphere is great.  Tables aren't creamed together and everything's kept clean.  They have a very large menu, which can be good - though not great for picky eaters like me because they try to be fancy with a lot of their menu items.  This comes back to the fried udon that my girlfriend ordered and got a bunch of other things on it that she didn't know about.

At the end of the day, nothing here's exceptional and this place is a little pricey for a lunch.  I don't think I'll be returning unless something changes."}
{"text":"We got the vegetable mini hot pot and spicy pork rib. The rib was spicy and went well with the rice. For dessert we got the Oreo crepe cake. The cake was good but there was not much Oreo flavour to it."}
{"text":"Extremely busy place. I went there 3 times now, and each time was great. We tried different hot pots, sides and rice dish..real fusion of Japanese and Taiwanese food. Would definitely take my gf there again."}
{"text":"Here is the thing with fission: you may not like every dish. What we ordered as our main courses didn't impress us. It's not that they taste bad or something, we just didn't dig it. They still taste fairly good. I guess it doesn't help when we are more impressed with what our neighbours ordered.
Their deserts are impressive, though. They are properly made and properly fusioned.
Their servers are nice and above average in their service. What they COULD improve is service time. It is not that we waited long, but my wife's dish came long after mine, making it awkward.
Will we come back? Very likely. There are so many dishes we would like to try."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Sunday and was immediately seated. Love the decor and atmosphere of the restaurant. Service was pretty good, and the menu was extensive. We were quite happy with everything we ordered (Taiwanese Style Popcorn Chicken, Boiled Clams, and the Japanese Style Sukiyaki Hot Pot). Will be back to try other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Great food.. Awesome variety.. Can have bbt and eat food Taiwanese food... Best of all the dessert is awesome too.. Can spend hours there with friends... No wonder there's always a line up.. Best of all the restaurant opens till late.. Would definitely recommend.."}
{"text":"Located in the plaza of First Markham Place. 

They have a huge menu. They have one menu for food and one menu for desserts. They also serve alcoholic drinks. I'm surprised by how large of a selection of desserts they have. The prices of the desserts though... seem to be a little too high.... I mean the desserts are wayyyy overpriced. 

Some of the cakes cost ($14.95)... this is for a single slice of cake... ummmkayy...  they also have Mille crepe cakes. These were prices at $12.99. This is like $5 more expensive than Millie's creperie. The portion is probably not that big either. You're probably better off getting a crepe cake else where, or maybe two.. Another thing that seems pretty overpriced is the molten tarts. These tarts are priced at $11.99 for two and they are not that big either... ummmm not worth. But pretty much most of their desserts are overpriced. But they have a nice variety. 

Food wise, the price seems more reasonably priced. Some things are better priced than others. 

I ordered the beef sukiyaki hot pot, peach green tea and the chocolate mochi waffle. 

Taiwanese beef sukiyaki hot pot ($17.95) - the broth was on the sweeter side, it doesn't taste that heavy. The portion of the meat was really little. Probably about 5 pieces. The meat was decent. The udon was good. The udon didn't taste plain. It was chewy and flavourful. The hot pot also came with a few other items like imitated crab meat, pork balls, fish tofu, tofu and mushrooms. It also came with an egg on the side. Make sure you cook the egg in the beginning otherwise it will not cook later. The taste was ok but not really filling. The presentation was nice. It came in a nice pot on top of a fire.  

Peach green tea ($4.99) - this was just a plain peach green tea with no tapioca or anything for $4.99. Kinda not worth it. It was pretty small. You're better off getting a large drink from chatime or gong cha instead for the same price. Flavour wise, it has a odd peach flavour. I prefer Chatime a peach green tea better. 

Chocolate mochi waffle ($10.99) - pictures are deceiving. I was expecting my chocolate mochi waffle to be actually chocolate flavour mochi. But it was just the regular plain flavours mochi. The texture of the mochi was chewy as it's rice cake. But I expecting the crust of the waffle to be crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside but it wasn't. It was all chewy. Besides that, in the picture the chocolate mochi waffle was supposed to come with chocolate ice cream. But in my order it was vanilla instead. Besides Besides that, there was bananas on my waffle. This was something that I was totally not expecting because it wasn't in the descriptions. Besides besides besides that, there was chocolate and caramel sauce on my waffle. The menu never showed two different sauces in the waffle. It only showed chocolate sauce. Both theses sauces combined made the dessert extremely sweet. It was pretty disappointing. 

As for service. Service is extremely slow. The waiters most of the time would ignore you. It's so hard to get a hold of the waiters here. 

Design wise. The place looks pretty nice and cozy. The lighting is kinda dim. It was a nice looking place. 

Overall, food is okay, food price is ok. Dessert is meh. Dessert price is overpriced. Not worth"}
{"text":"This place is a 3.5 for me as it's hit or miss depending on what you order. The dinner food is where there is the most inconsistent but the dessert here is great. 

Their hot pots, Taiwanese fried rice or dons are pretty safe picks. All are flavourful and decently portioned. 

My favourite dessert here is the Mochi Waffle. It's got the chewiness of a mochi in the centre of a regular waffle and is so good with the green tea ice cream and red bean. Highly recommended dessert.

Prepare for some longer wait times if you're going around peak dinner hours and even for late night dessert."}
{"text":"I had the standard taiwanese sausage and minced pork on rice with boiled egg. Not as good as other places I've tried because there is too much rice and not enough toppings to match the rice. The sausage and minced pork wasn't that flavorful either compared to Papa Changs, which I think still holds the title for the best Taiwanese restaurant in Markham.

This place is new, so they may still be learning and improving their dishes, so I'm interested in coming back later on to try it out and see if it's improved. The restaurant looks big, but it's mainly booths which aren't very space efficient, every time I've passed this restaurant it seemed to be packed. When I ate here I was lucky to have came here for late lunch so it wasn't busy.

The service wasn't that good, which is normal in asian restaurants I suppose. The decor was nicer than other restaurants and even had a bar."}
{"text":"Food - 3.5/5
Comfort - 4/5
DESSERT - 5/5

You need to check out their dessert menu... it's very good!"}
{"text":"Pros:
- Good value
- Food was good for the most part
- Environment and vibe was good
- 10% off with cash payment

Cons:
- Consistency: been here twice and pudding wasn't as good the second time around
- Wait times can be long

Ordered:
$12.99 Japanese Chicken Curry Sizzling Plate - Overall pretty good. Good size portion. Would recommend if you like Japanese curry
$12.99 Teriyaki Beef Sizzling Plate - Overall pretty good. Good size portion. Would recommen
$8.99 Karage - Overall pretty good. Similar to others
$6.99 Egg Pudding - First time around, it was very good. Pudding was light and fluffy. Second time, not so much. Pudding was dense, hard and overly sweet
$6.99 Milk Pudding - Pretty good. Would recommend
$6.99 Marshmellow Stuffed Ice cream - Wasn't very good. Ice cream was rock hard and marshmellow had weird texture. Wouldn't recommend

Conclusion:
I would overall recommend Mabu Generation. Both times I went, the wait times weren't too long. The food overall is pretty good, although it is getting hard to standout with all the Taiwanese restaurants opening. The portions are large and filling. I overall enjoyed my meal and would recommend going if you are in the area and are feeling Taiwanese."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch today and we ordered a pork miso ramen, minced pork on rice, sausages and deep fried squid roll. The pork noodle was alright, found the soup to be salty. The sausages and deep fried squid roll were good. The minced pork on rice was not that great, it was warm when we got it, not hot. I found overall their food needs to be hotter."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars. I come here quite often for a quick bite or dessert. It definitely satisfies the cravings. For drinks, I usually get the Apple Aloe drink, green milk tea or black milk tea with less sugar. I find it's too sweet with the regular amount of sugar. 

As for the food all the deep fried stuff is what'd you'd expect. Not amazing nor bad. The last time I was there I ordered the spicy braised beef soup - it was so spicy I could hardly enjoy it. I'd recommend to get the spicy sauce on the side if you plan on ordering this dish. I also got the chicken cutlet on rice with their house made gravy sauce which I wasn't really a fan of. And last but last least you can't you wrong with any of the sizzling rice dishes. 

Now onto desserts. My favorite would be the mango sago, it's my favorite dessert at any Asian place I go to. I've tried the special brick toast tower and didn't like it. It took really long to make and was really hard when it finally came out."}
{"text":"Located in First Markham Place, MABU Generation is definitely a popular modern eatery for the 905 locals. You can easily satisfy all your Taiwanese food cravings here, AND ALSO, you can find anything and everything on the extensive menu from appetizers, rice/noodles/udon, sizzling hot plates... to 16 a-mazing mini hot pots, refreshing drinks, and TONS of desserts (It has a separate menu!) I serious don't know where to begin lol.

I have been to MABU Generation a couple of times, and I really enjoyed the food and my experience there. Service was spot on, the waitress was courteous, attentive, responsive. I love how they kept our table clean x organized while we eat.

My BFF and I came here on a weekend afternoon between 2:30pm - 4:30pm... not too many people, so it was nice and quiet to chat :) We tried the H06 Japanese Style Miso Soup mini hot pot and we were stuffed! It had a good amount of ingredients, with vermicelli on the side. We also shared the Popcorn Chicken (a Taiwanese staple, must order!) and the Taiwanese Oyster Pancake... not exactly the ones made with all eggs. It had a gooey, gelatinous, chewy texture, and the oysters were surprisingly huge; I quite enjoyed this dish :) Try it if you feel adventurous lol.

----------

I came back again, and this time with my coworkers on a Thursday evening, just before 6:00pm. And let me tell you, by 6:20pm, the place was completely PACKED. I suggest that you should make a reservation just in case (so glad we did!). I heard that you can't make a reservation on the weekend (Fri, Sat, Sun) - correct me if I'm wrong!

All the food at MABU are great for sharing, especially when we want to try a bit of everything ;) We shared the Curry chicken with rice on sizzling hot plate, Smoked Salmon creamy udon, and the Matcha red bean mochi chewy waffles! All very tasty :)

We also had the Traditional waffle with popcorn chicken and maple syrup - definitely a kid's favourite - it comes with a bit of fruits too! The only thing that threw me off was that tangy light yellow mayo sauce on the chicken... I think it was a mistake? It did not go with the maple syrup nor the overall dish.

Nonetheless, I would still come back again to try other dishes, especially the desserts! Btw, if you post a photo on social media (per table), you will receive a free milk pudding dessert or a free $4.99 non-alcoholic drink. So, get posting ;)"}
{"text":"we came here for a birthday party, and I was super excited reading all the reviews, I wanted to try multiple things on the menu.

our wait was about an hour and half long, which was understandable because they did look busy.

Now, when you usually get a cup of water to your table, your excepting that water to be some what cold, or tap water cold at least. The water we received was warm/mid hot water. 
so that threw me off. 
The service was not the best, it took a while for them to take our orders, but lets not fault the kitchen staff, because after our orders were finally taken, the food came quick.

I had the sizzling plate with teriyaki beef and rice and it was delicious, the right amount of sauce was incorporated into the dish that every bite was indeed a mouthful of teriyaki goodness.

we shared a seafood platter with fries, mussels, shrimp, and clams. The clams were mostly shells so that was disappointing but the flavor was still great.

I heard that the desserts were really good so we also order some desserts as well, please beware! these desserts are hybrid and made for giants! LOL.

overall the experience was great and I would go back to try some other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Food is average and for the quality of food, it's not the best and freshest ingredient. It is overpriced and overrated."}
{"text":"Good place for taiwanese variety food. Imo its better than petite potato. Similar atmosphere but better food quality. 
Food quality is generally good... thou  it could land a miss.. on rare occasions
Love the seafood hotpot! And matcha cheesecake ! The matcha cheesecake is definitely a must try for matcha lovers 
Good for friends and big groups dinner 
Lines are quite long. Wait times can go for 30-45 mins . You cannot reserve seats on fridays to sundays."}
{"text":"The wait on a Friday night for 2 people was about 35 to 40 minutes. 

The service was great. Staffs were very friendly and polite. 

The minced pork rice is too slimy with the raw egg and not enough sauce.  Kinda blend. Not enough meat flavor. 

The desserts were good.  I like the molten cheese tart. The crust could be a little better and the filling can be creamier. Otherwise it's not bad."}
{"text":"Mabu is kinda one of those spots you go to when you don't really know what you want since they have hot pots, rice dishes, noodles, desserts, bubble tea and alcohol so it can pretty much satisfy any picky group. 
But the catches are...
- prices don't quite match the quantity or quality of food you're getting. 
- desserts can be a hit or miss 
- The hot pots are OK but the products they are using in it is so damn cheap that I wonder why they charge me so damn much.. like  those small rice noodles they give u are like 3 in a pack for like a dollar.. so....
- service is not really existent 
Overall, its a good place when you don't know where to go. Some of the snack options are actually very good, but the prices here are seriously steep. Like I'm not stingy or anything but I know when i'm getting ripped off. SO... I would avoid going to mabu most of the time. But it's not bad, but not good. so meh. 
** if there is a line, I suggest NOT waiting**"}
{"text":"I go to MABU Generation a lot because they have a large number of selection in their, drink, food, and dessert menu. They tend to be very busy at nights, but the busier they get the more orders they messed up. The food is not bad but not especially good. There was one time when I went and order mapo tofu with pork on rice which I waited 30 minutes for and still didn't come. I asked them if they made it yet then they said it was coming out soon. 15 minutes later I asked them again and they said they have not made it yet.  So I ended up waiting almost an hour for the food."}
{"text":"been here many times and tried many things on the menu and most of it is just mediocre. however i really like the white peach white grape green tea, very delicious and pretty unique, also for dessert the japanese soybean milk tiramisu is very good. kind of tastes like a fluffy vanilla cake. for food i would recommend the mini hot pots, not amazing but i'd say it's better than the other main courses. got the black pepper teriyaki beef rice a few times and the last time i got it it tasted not good. it was very bitter and not enjoyable at all. lines are usually very long and if you pay cash it is 10% off which is pretty good."}
{"text":"Came here late in the evening for dinner (last call). The food was delicious and dressed with lots of MSG (for sure). My friend ordered the pork ribs with cheese on a hot plate and I ordered the taiwanese beef noodles. The beef brisket was a little hard for my liking, I prefer it to be a little more tenderized. But the beef broth was definitely how it should have tasted. It was a strong broth with lots of MSG (maybe I'm wrong, but I was definitely thirsty throughout the night after my meal). Given the MSG I would still probably come back because there isn't much opened until 2am at night. Sometimes you just need that midnight snack."}
{"text":"Dined here on Friday night, it was busy but service was quick.  Food is pretty good and the prices are reasonable. They also have a great selection of desserts.  love their crepes cake, yogurt cakes!"}
{"text":"Ive seen the sign of this place for quite a while but have yet to try it. My girl came in town and since we havent seen each other for so long, just dinner wasnt enough to catch up with everything. So even though we were so full after dinner, we came here to sit down for dessert. There was a large crowd at the door. But it was very systematical and u get a digital ticket. And its says you are guaranteed a seating within 45mins otherwise you get a complimentary drink or something. 
The food smells pretty good. I will definitely come back to try it. As for dessert, im a big fan of green tea. So we ordered everything green tea. I liked everything, even though i was so full at the time. Portions were big too! Will definitely come back for another meal!"}
{"text":"MABU was delicious ! Such a great variety of food and the atmosphere was buzzing! Love this place and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wouldn't recommend this dessert place to u guys..service was okay just wasn't really satisfied with the food especially the green tea toast wasn't as good as I expected it would be"}
{"text":"Mabu Generation is a modern Taiwanese fusion restaurant that basically serves anything you can think of. What is impressive about this restaurant is the constant lineup. Despite locating in First Markham Place with tons of restaurants located in the mall, Mabu Generation always generate lots of visitor with queues even on weekday nights at 9pm. However, the variety of food and quality is definitely worth the wait. Mabu Generation strive for authenticity and annual they send chefs to Taiwan for training.

Tips: they take reservation for weeknights, but not weekends. 

The restaurant is elegantly decorated with traditional Taiwanese décor. There is a large wall painting of JiuFen region of Taiwan. The walls are also filled with Taiwanese posters and merchandise from the 70s and 80s. Sitting are large and comfy with great atmosphere created by the dim lights.

The service was excellent as staffs are very knowledgeable and will happily explain the menu. They are also very attentive and will make sure your water cup is always filled or will add soup for the hotpot.

Menu
The most impressive aspect of Mabu Generation is the sheer number of items that are offered on the menu. There are hotpots, rice, metal plates, noodles, fried snacks, drinks, dessert, to even alcoholic drinks. The menu is beautifully made with colorful illustrations. But the toughest part of the visit is probably choosing what you want as everything just looks so amazing. Don't be afraid to ask the staff and they will happily provide recommendations.
We tasted the personal hotpot. Despite the name \"personal\", the portion was quite large and it is best shared with 2-3 people. There were lots of toppings inside the hotpot from beef, pork belly, veggies, to other traditional Taiwanese hotpot ingredients. The broth was very rich and spicy and tasted authentic. There is also an instant noodle served on the side so you can add on later.

Beside the hotpot, we ordered a few side dishes to share. We loved Taiwanese popcorn chicken, and we must say that Mabu Generation has the best that we ever tried. The chicken was perfectly fried with crispy exterior and warm and tender meat inside. The chicken is also marinated well with a unique flavor to it. The sauce was excellent too. This is a must try item!

The cheese filled pork cutlet is a unique dish that makes the Japanese fried cutlet with a unique twist. It is filled with cheese inside so the cheese sauce will flow out when you cut the pork. It is certainly an interesting dish, also sided with fries.

Grilled beef tongue is made with sea salt and black pepper, sided with green onions. It is very tasty and the green onion sides bring out the flavor of the beef tongue.

The highlights of Mabu Generation are definitely its dessert. There are so many to choose from, all of them visually appealing and tasted great. 

Raindrop Cake with Sakura looks amazing and is very Instagrammable. It is made from clear jello with sakura (cheery bloomsome) stuffed inside and crushed Cheerios on the side. 
Matcha cheesecake is served with red bean paste on the side. The cheesecake was delightful and very light and fluffy inside. 

Tiramisu cake in a box also looks very appealing with a mix of sponge cake, lady finger, and tiramisu cream.

Being a Taiwanese place, there is also an extensive selection bubble teas and drinks.

Overall we enjoyed Mabu Generation a lot and was very impressed by their vast menu selection, décor, and also food quality. We especially loved their popcorn chicken, hotpot, and dessert selections. Would recommend anyone to want a taste of Taiwan in Toronto to at least come for a visit!"}
{"text":"It's very busy, and food is pretty tasty! The design of restaurant is cozy. Staffs are friendly.  I definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Since Mabu Generation has opened, there's almost always a lineup outside the restaurant.

Situated in the busy corner of First Markham Place (or as us Asians would call it, 'FMP'), Mabu Generation has opened for a period of time now, with sister stores along Yonge St. If FMP is too far of a drive for you, the ones along Yonge are pretty much the same (minus the larger seating area, slightly bigger menu that not everything will ever get ordered... and ridic line ups). 

Once you make your way through the main doors, you'll naturally find people leaning on the glass/walls on their phone, waiting for their seat. There's a few waiting chairs inside, like 4 at most. When you get your number, you'll either sit down in one of these four chairs, lean against a wall, or walk outside for literally some air. Hard to imagine how it is in the winter... anyhow, their decor is average, not anything fancy. Seating area is decent; you get enough room to move around without hitting your next table neighbor.

Staff are efficient and friendly, and the place does get very busy, especially on weekends. Be prepared to wait for an average of 30 min if you come here on the weekend. Whether or not the hype is worth it... not really imo.

So, onto the food. Their beef with salmon roe on rice (egg extra) is pretty good; flavourful but not too salty, and the fish roe is an interesting addition along with the egg yolk, which gives it a nice balance. The individual hotpots are also worth a try, any more than that you're probably better off at a hotpot restaurant (in terms of flavour, variety, and portion). Their spicy cheese ramen is VERY spicy. Good, but spicy. If you order this dish, it might be a good idea to share the spiciness with a friend. For dessert, we gave the raindrop cake a try, which is obviously essentially water/gelatin with a sakura inside, and some graham powder on the side. It's a nice IG dish, but taste wise... not much taste to it lol. Tip: if you post a picture of their food item on any social media, you get a complimentary dessert (there's only one or two to choose from, and it's specified on their menu cover).

Mabu is okay good for desserts/snacks and drinks, but not as a main meal. I personally prefer the locations at Yonge; it's easier to find seating, and the menu size is also less overwhelming.

Many things are overpriced here, and too many choices on the menu makes people overwhelmed, as usual."}
{"text":"Consistently excellent service. Great variety of menu items for every type of foodie in the group. 

The long lineups are still there but if you go early outside of lunch/dinner rush hour you can snag a seat. 

The sukiyaki hotpot was surprisingly good. The ingredients were all very fresh and the broth was sweet, soaking in everything. Highly recommend. 

We got a free milk pudding dessert by posting on Instagram. Glad to see they have this ongoing promotion despite being open for some time now!"}
{"text":"I've routinely been back to MABU ever since my first review.  
It is always a long wait during nighttime on weekends so make reservations or be prepared to chill in the front.

There's a lot of servers walking around and this one dude who stood in the corner like a mafia boss and spots out the problem areas.  It's kinda funny looking at him too hehe.  He's so serious.

I loooved the hotpot soup here - the special H01 and I change the noodles to vermicelli (and I add more vermicelli to the order hehe).
I've actually stopped eating pork and noted that I'd like no pork in the soup.  The waitress (great English) came back and told me that the broth was made from pork bones :( so I had to change it.  But THANK YOU for being considerate and letting me know.

My boyfriend ordered the hot plate beef with rice.  He was soo skeptical when it came out because it wasn't cooked. I do agree that the plate doesn't cook it fully as some of it was still light pink even though we spread evenly across the hot plate as soon as we got it.  Probably wouldn't order again.  Especially because I wanted veggies too :(

Their spaghetti hot plate is bomb.  The sauce (black bean?) had a kick in it that was delicious.  The chicken was plentiful and tender.  I loved how it continuously cooks in front of me too.  It tasted good even after being heated up.

For the 2 of us it was $26ish.  

Will def be back next time I'm craving hot plate food."}
{"text":"After a long wait, my boyfriend finally agreed to try this place out. It is located in first markham place so you already know it will be a hassle trying to find parking. TIP: stay idle in one lane and someone is sure to get out! It's a pain to circle around the lot trying to find parking! We waited like 5 minutes until someone came out. 

When we first walked in, we were greeted immediately by all of the staff. We were seated and there was water in a cup already on our table. The place had a nice atmosphere and amazing decor. 

I really wanted to try the hot pot but my boyfriend didn't want it so we opted for don rice.My bf got N02 which was beef and chicken with mabu special sauce with egg on rice. I got the pork with egg on rice. I should have gotten a noodles dish instead, my pork was really delicious though. 

For apps, we got the takoyaki- which was to die for. It tasted so much better with the wasabi. I love the heat of the wasabi on it. We also got the popcorn chicken. DO get it. They were so generous with the portion of the popcorn chicken I swear it can be eaten on it's own as a meal. It was so tender and juicy and seasoned very well! Best 9 bucks spent on chicken! I would definitely go again just to get the chicken! It wasn't your normal battered chicken, it was seasoned very well and had some nice spices.

The service was top notch, although one of the servers messed up an order. She gave us the wrong order which belonged to the table right beside us, I thought it was odd because there was no chicken in it and my bf already ate half of it when another server brought out both of our dishes. 

Other than that, it was a good experience. The food was delicious. Do get the popcorn chicken!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely over-hyped. I don't get why there are always line ups here!

Grilled Chicken with House Special BBQ sauce on Rice ($13)
The chicken was flavorful, tasted really good. Love the sauce - it was a little too salty for my liking though. I liked how it was served with the poached egg - breaking the egg and having the runny egg yolk mixing in with bbq sauce on rice was noms. My only complaint was the ridiculous amount of rice. 

Taiwanese BBQ Sausage & Minced pork on Rice ($10)
This was okay, taste was good but nothing special to be honest. I've had better taiwanese minced pork and bbq sauces elsewhere. The picture is deceiving as there wasn't as much meat as it looked. The bowl was pretty much filled with rice all the way to the top and just a thin layer of the other ingredients, no depth at all. 

Food tasted good, but way overpriced and I can't get over the amount of rice they serve.
Don't forget to post pictures of your food on social media to get a free dessert. It's actually a pretty decent freebie - it's a full dish of milk pudding with 9 pieces."}
{"text":"We got the okonomiyaki fries and brick toast. The fries were really good-crispy and not oily. But the toast made me feel nauseous. It was drenched in coffee flavoured icecream. I personally don't like coffee flavoured foods so it wasn't enjoyable at all. There was no description of it at all in the menu (all it said was honey toast with icecream and fruits-there were no fruits either). We asked the server what it was and she didn't even tell us it was coffee flavoured. We wouldn't have gotten it if we knew. Service wasn't satisfactory either: she forgot one of our orders and didn't give back change...

Wifi password: 8888888888"}
{"text":"The atmosphere and decore of the place is pretty good.  

The thing that they must improve on is their server's training.  Every time I go there I hear the servers dropping a whole bunch of dishes.  Good thing they use plastics?

Also... they are pretty bad at seating customers.  There are 2-3 empty tables but they make people wait?  Not sure why"}
{"text":"We ordered the H01 and H12 hotpot, the red date and longan tea, and 2 toasts. The food was good, not the best hotpot and toasts i've tried but they're above average. Service was very good. We were greeted when came in and seated quickly, asked for extra sauces and were given right away. I would definitely come back again if they can keep this up."}
{"text":"Where do I begin? The food was great, the service was nice and very welcoming, washrooms clean, but the menu... had me flipping through it 10 times because there soo much on the menu wasn't too sure what to get. 

After looking through my menu I needed to just order something because I was hungry and looking through the menu which they also has pictures which is a plus. Didn't really help this time around. I just ordered sliced beef with chicken and rice. Sounds simple but it was delicious, but not worth 12.99 tho lol and the crispy chicken nuggets for $8.99 was the one of the best fried chicken I've had with the sauce that's why this place deserves a 5 Star. 

Here's a little story of what happened. My gf and I ordered our food, and the table beside us was also waiting for there's. I got a bowl of rice and beef and told my girl... I don't think this is mine and still ate it anyways, the lady comes back to our table and brings 2 bowls of rice and beef and she's like WHERE YOU GET THAT?!? She took it away and gave me my correct order. So I was soooo full off the first bowl my second bowl I barely touched.

Even tho they messed up the orders they handled it properly, and still got it done without any complaints. 

Definitely going to come back here again"}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to try this place out since other restaurants weren't open yet.
Walked in and it was really nicely decorated.
We got seated right away.

We picked items from their Lunch specials. They don't show it online
i think it was $10.99 comes with meal and drink. We upgraded to a slush for extra $$

I got the Taiwanese Style Popcorn chicken with rice and upgraded drink to Sesame slush.
The Popcorn chicken was a good portion, but i found it a tad too salty. The sesame slush was delicious! Nicely blended, you can really taste the black sesame and it wasn't too sweet.

My friend ordered their deep fried pork chop with Black pepper sauce and upgraded drink to Taro slush.
The Pork chop was deep fried nicely, inside was still juicy. The black pepper sauce was good as well. Again their Taro slush was tasty. blended nicely

I would come back for their slush and a nice get together with friends to chit chat as they open late 2 am."}
{"text":"I ate at Mabu Generation with a friend of mine over the holidays. The menu was a bit overwhelming because there was so much to choose from. They even had a seperate large menu for desserts! I settled for the hot bowl which was labelled as a recommendation. Overall I enjoyed my food but I found the serving size a little bit on the small aide considering its price point. The service we received was OK. There were times where we had trouble calling our server to order and for water. Nonetheless, the restaurant has a nice and relaxing atmosphere. I would probably come back for a quick bite in the future."}
{"text":"It's a new place at fmp. The place looks neat and it's always busy but in terms of food there's no competitive advantage as there are many other places I would have something similar."}
{"text":"I absolutely like this place. It offers a variety of fusion foods and desserts. 
It was very busy on a Sunday night since the waiting time was about 30 minutes. 
Ordered two sizzling hot plates, M02 (Japanese styled beef) and M05 (Taiwanese-styled spicy pork intestines). They were very delicious. M05 was quite spicy but it tastes very good.
Service is also good. Waitresses keep refilling our water, although they kept forgetting to get me ice water but it's fine. They greeted and said Thank You when you leave. I got scared a bit when they both screamed out loud when I left. 
Overall I gave 4 stars for both foods and services. I recommend and will comeback to try the mini hotpot and desserts."}
{"text":"Ok, I don't know why the bad reviews (I guess mostly cause there's a line), but the food there is absolutely amazingly. Everything was made so well and so good. I highly recommend this place. The only thing is hat I went around 3 so there was no line. Also they don't have wifi and if you pay by cash it's 10% cheaper."}
{"text":"What an amazing experience! The food selection are ample yet creatively prepped. Almost every single thing I ordered there were photogenic (in terms of presentation), tasted anywhere from very good to amazingly good. 

Oh, and the service was impeccable too. 

Highly recommended"}
{"text":"The interior design is nice, and i like the ambiance.  the restaurant is noisy and hard to chat around.  Menu photo look way better than \"real\" food.   

The customer service just ok,  Tthey didnt not pay enough attention.  Mix up the order and bill.  the fired pork has cheese inside but over cook.  The egg wrap is light and taste good."}
{"text":"I think this is one of my new favourite restaurants in Markham. The restaurant is super cute with old school Taiwanese decor, the menu is huge (one menu for food, another for desserts and drinks). They have everything from hotpot to traditional Taiwanese rice dishes to snacks. Their hotpot is good but not spectacular. Their braised pork belly rice and popcorn chicken are my favourite dishes at Mabu. Portions are generous and prices are very reasonable. I'll likely be back more than a few times because there are so many things I want to try on their menu!"}
{"text":"It wasn't my first time here but I had an interesting experience on my last visit which I thought I would share. A server dropped a glass cup onto the floor which shattered and one of the pieces flew under the table and cut my ankle. It was a small cut but still hurt and bled nonetheless, so I asked for a bandaid. Multiple staff came to apologize and said I could come back if my cut required further treatment. They gave us 20% off our bill. Obviously it wasn't a happy experience but to be honest for an Asian place I thought they handled it pretty well. 

Onto the food... their menu is very extensive as they have separate drinks and dessert menus. Their specialty is the hotpot for one, which is offered in a variety of spicy or non-spicy flavours. Their menu has a heavy Taiwanese influence, with a lot of noodle and rice dishes and also bubble tea and grass jelly desserts. Overall their quality of food and drinks are good, and there is something for everyone. There always seems to be a long wait for a table regardless of how late you come, so I wouldn't come here if I was starving. I give this place 4 stars if I ignore the glass incident, which was unpleasant but hopefully just an isolated incident."}
{"text":"TL;DR: 3-3.5/5 Make a reservation if you're visiting on a weeknight to avoid the long wait (they don't accept reservations on the weekend). There are some hits and misses on the menu. Know what to order. I recommend the creamy cheese udon and mabu roasted milk tea. 

Be prepared to wait for at least 20 minutes to be seated if you're visiting past 6pm.  Food quality is decent, there are some hits and misses. I've been here multiple times so I try to stick with my favourites, the creamy cheese udon and the mabu roasted milk tea. The cheese and cream sauce on spaghetti and the creamy cheese udon are actually the same despite what it says on the menu, though both are good. The roasted meat ball bolognese spaghetti is nothing special, something you could make at home really. The sizzling hot plate we ordered did not sizzle.. which was a bit disappointing. Service is generally good. There are a few servers who are more attentive, they brought us extra napkins without us asking. A major issue I had was when they began wiping down the table beside us and the strong chlorine smell hit, really ruined the experience."}
{"text":"2.5 Star but since Mabu Generation is brand new, I will give them 3 Star Rating with some reservation.

Lunch Special $10.99 only available on Weekday. Seems like a good deal with Salad, Pickled Cabbage, Bubble Tea and Dessert. 

LS11 Hot & Sour Sweet Potato Noodle w/Vegetable & Minced Pork ($10.99)
- No Salad and Pickled Cabbage was served
- Their Tapioca was not ready, so they replaced with Lychee Jello (There is nothing on the menu about $0.50 surcharge)
- Noodle was tasty with just a little bit of kick. 
- Waitress not even sure about the dessert until I asked: Ended up getting something bitter covered with brown sugar (meh)

Salt & Pepper Chicken with Waffle ($9.99)
- Love the concept of a Taiwanese twist on Western Chicken & Waffle 
- Chicken was moist but lack any seasoning and typical Taiwanese fried chicken batter
- Needs more Syrup

Staff need more training. Food need more fine tuning,

Mabu Generation has a lot of potential. I love the concept of a Taiwanese Izakaya. Hopefully they will sort everything out soon,"}
{"text":"The overall environment of the restaurant is nice. The waiting time for a table is a little long since everyone wants to see what all the hype is about. 

Although their menu isn't anything special, they do have a House Special BBQ sauce which I am a big fan of. I did notice that a lot of things we ordered contained too much rice and came into the realization that I was deceived by the pictures.

In spite of the basic menu, the staff appeared nice and their service was fast once you were seated. Very attentive, my glass of water was not empty the entire night. 

I only recommend MABU to anyone who has the patience to wait to be seated since they do not take reservations."}
{"text":"I went with coworkers for lunch on a Friday.  Our group of seven ordered six different items.  Some were from the lunch menu, priced at $10.99 and came with a cold drink, and some were from the regular menu.  Below is a summary of my co-workers and my opinions:

Taiwanese Braised Beef Noodle from lunch menu (2 orders)
- One coworker rated it at 3.5 stars - it was okay. There was too much tendon not enough real meat.  The noodle and the broth tasted good.  Big portion.
 - Another coworker rated it at 2.5 stars - too much tendon.  The broth was spicy, yet there was no \"chilli\" sign in menu to indicate it.  She doesn't eat spicy.  She didn't enjoy it.

Hot and Sour Chicken with Rice from lunch menu
 -  Coworker rated it at 3 stars.  The meat portion was adequate. The sauce was too spicy for her.  Not the fault of the food.

Popcorn Chicken with Rice from lunch menu
- Coworker rated it 2 stars.  She found the chicken not crunchy at all.  Kind of missing the point of \"popcorn\". 

Smoked Salmon Fried Rice from regular menu $11.99
Coworker rated it 1 star.  There was barely any salmon.  The salmon bits looked more like diced carrot bits (see picture).  He said he paid $12 for a plate of fried plain rice.

Baked Spaghetti with Meat from regular menu $11.99
- Coworker rated it 1 star. The disadvantage of having a big menu shows in this dish. After waiting for 25 minutes, the baked spaghetti came out lukewarm.   It was as if the kitchen didn't expect a baked dish at lunch rush, so the oven was not pre-heated.

Traditional Minced Pork Rice $8.99
- This was my order. I rated it 3 stars. It was all right in terms of taste and value.  No wow factor.

The average of 7 ratings is 2.3 stars. 

Services was amazing. We tipped extra as the low rating is solely kitchen related."}
{"text":"I am a fan! No wonder the lines are so long! So many people want to come, and for those who do come, they stay here for HOURS. The ambiance makes the restaurant a super comforting place for dates, families, and friends :) The food is definitely instagram worthy and the service is very courteous too. Every time I come into MABU, I always feel like it's Christmastime.

In our table of 6 we ordered the Kimchi Korean Stew Mini hot pot, the seafood tofu hot pot (with udon instead of vermicelli) and the Curry with cheese hot plate rice. All three tasted very different but were flavourful regardless. All the dishes were a bit on the salty side. I'm not sure if it's an MSG thing, but I did think the seafood tofu soup was way to flavorful for the ingredients they put in. The food of course wasn't THE BEST, but it was for sure above average. They really go out of the way to make their dishes hipster and memorable.

The best part of ordering hot plate/ hot pot is that the meal stays really warm the entire time. There's definitely no need to rush eating here.

Overall, a very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Came here cus my niece was raving about this place.  They do have a wide selection of food to choose from whether it's a meal or a dessert.

It's cool too that if you take a photo of your meal and share it on social media, you can get a drink or dessert worth $4.99 for free."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at this place and it was recommended by my cousin who lives around this area. I really liked the ambiance and vibe I got from this restaurant. We went around 830Pm and it was quite busy but given for a Saturday night. We waited for about 30 minutes and got seated quickly when they called us in. There's a wide selection of foods to pick from and it took me a while to decide what I wanted to eat. Was told that the hot pot dishes are their speciality but we opted for rice dishes. While looking at the menu, it looked like they offered a lot more pork dishes then other meats. Portions are quite generous, I definitely could not finish my plate. Aside from the main menu, their drinks & dessert menus had a LOT of things too. Dessert prices can cost as much as a dinner meal. 
There's a lot of waiters/waitresses available and they come quick to your table. They accept all kinds of payment.  
I would come back again to try the other dishes!"}
{"text":"We arrived around 8:30pm and waited approximately 40-50 minutes for a table as it was quite busy. Once we got seated, the server came quickly and we ordered. The dishes came out relatively fast. The dishes ordered were the boiled clams, the minced pork, seafood hot pot and a chicken curry on a hot plate.

The only two people who seemed relatively happy about their food were the ones that ordered the hot pot and clams. 

The egg that came with the minced pork was undercooked, and the curry that I had had a very strong black pepper taste which did not make the dish taste good to me. The curry was sweet after the black pepper taste left and I did not finish the plate. I felt that I should have ordered something else.

We did get a free milk pudding dessert because we posted a photo of our dish on IG. That was  pretty much the highlight of the night.

Service over all was quick and they were friendly. Food was meh. Prices were a bit expensive.
Definitely not worth the hype."}
{"text":"Typical loud lounge style setting, that being said, the food was above average, but their selection of desserts is what you visit for. The wait times may be long if you come here on an evening but if you love everything matcha, you will enjoy the nice selection.

I recommend coming with a group of friends and ordering a large selection, everything has great portions so you definitely will have plenty to eat and try."}
{"text":"Understaffed restaurant that has insanely long wait times (they'll give you a ticket number to indicate your table wait and even state that they'll give you a free appetizer if your wait is longer than 45 mins). Good thing you can make reservations though! This place definitely reminded me of the likes of a Japanese izakaya but wasn't able to deliver the same experience.

They have a massive menu so there's something for everyone, however, main dishes were very salty - wasn't too impressed taste wise. And for the price point they're charging, I was definitely expecting something better. However, props for trying to innovate with asian-western food offerings (and for a 10% discount if paying by cash).

With the abundance of better tasting Asian food nearby at lower price points, this place has its work cut out for them once the hype dies down."}
{"text":"I ordered the taro milk tea with tapioca and the popcorn chicken and waffle. The milk tea itself was pretty good. However, the tapioca was undercooked and hard to chew. The popcorn chicken came with a sauce all over and it did not suit it. The chicken was undercooked and a little raw inside. The waffle was soggy and undercooked as well. I prefer my waffles to be more crispy. I would not come here again and I do not recommend getting tapioca or the popcorn chicken here."}
{"text":"This is one of the only places that serve mini hot pots, I was so attracted I needed to give it a try! I love the concept of it and would totally recommend it. I do not recommend the one I got, there are many other ones to choose from.  I like how there are A lot of toppings with a wide variety given. Unfortunately it was a ay too oily and spicy for my liking, I can handle a lot of spice but this tasted like I was drinking spicy oil. I ordered house special hot soup with instant noodle. Cost $16.99"}
{"text":"Summary: a popular place in First Markham Square gears towards young people. Good environment, mid-priced, OK food.

My friends and I went to this place after ski trip. We arrive to this place around 10 at night, and there were still a lot of people there. My friends highly recommended this place because its one-person-portion mini hotpot. The hotpot was less than $20. I like the spicy hotpot but I found it just OK.
This place is nicely decorated, but average food. It is a good place to chill with friends. It has huge variety, from dessert to hotpot to ramen.
Recommend to go if you want to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"Mabu is literally a jack of all trades in terms of cuisine. They have hot pot, spaghettis, donburi, hot plates, desserts of every kind, drinks, bubble teas, you name it. But, a jack of all trades is a master of none! 

We came at 12am on a Friday night. I really appreciate how late they are open since everyone else is closed. They do that loud greeting thing which I find unnecessary since their place is very loud already. I also really like their decor and ambience. It has that dim, kinda hipster, wooden feel. (Unfortunately dim lighting = bad pix). I was in a very YOLO mood and got the hot pot H08 I believe and I wasn't a fan. I found it to be very sweet and at the end I was sick of it. I also found the discrepancy from the pictures to the product to be massive. it's literally a lie. We also ordered the shake that was advertised and that was also vastly different from the photo. I do not recommend both of these. 

We also ordered the soya bean tiramisu thing which was very cute, but we found that there was no coffee flavour which means it really didn't taste like a tiramisu. All the prices were quite more than the average so I wasn't that impressed. Hot pot being 17.99, shake was 7.49, and tiramisu was 11.99 or so.  

That being said, I would only go to Mabu if it's the only one open late at night and I am starving. The high prices for the low quality products are a killer. I really hope they up their game in the future."}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed over this place. The food is okay, tastes fine, and service is fine (for the most part). Now why would I rate it a 2 out of 5? Let's get down to it. 

First time coming here with my friend, I wanted something spicy and soupy so I picked the same order as my friend and went with one of their spicy hot pots. Turns out, they use a peanut base for the soup and thanks to my allergy, I had to change to another. They were nice enough to tell me and recommended me to pick another, so I went with another spicy hot pot, hoping that I could replace the one I couldn't eat. The waitress took my order, only to come back out as another person to tell me I can't have that one either because the soup base has peanuts too. This went on for all the orders I wanted until eventually she told me I can't have any of the spicy hot pots because they all have peanut as their base. Okay... why couldn't they have let me know from the start instead of making me change my order 4 times and making me wait literally 40 minutes?? 

My friend had gotten her order long before I got mine and she even finished her food before I did; we shared a dessert but since I wasn't done eating, she ate first - which I'm fine with but the idea of having to make her wait for me all because the waitresses didn't do their job right? 

I hate how you have to order on this piece of paper, which means all your food comes at once. The waitresses didn't even bother to think to bring dessert out AFTER we finished our meals. She didn't even bother to ask either. I mean if it's not common sense that people eat dessert after their meals... and proper customer service to ask just in case, then yeah. Major disappointment here. 

I ended up getting the seafood and tofu hot pot because that was the only one besides the cheese hot pot that didn't have peanuts in the base. Alas, it also meant that it wasn't spicy, thanks killjoys! But honestly, the soup was pretty good and no oil was found in it, which I liked. Seafood was surprisingly really fresh and there was quite an abundant of food. Amazing because it doesn't look like much but there was actually so much food, we ended up not being able to finish it. 

For dessert we got the matcha and Hokkaido melted cheese? I forget what it's called but each order came with 2 pieces and were both the same price (10.99), so we asked the waitress to mix it up for us. I don't know what it was but the matcha melted cheese left a sour taste in my mouth, and I couldn't even finish my half (half of one btw) because it tasted so revolting. Hokkaido was the better one. Definitely just go for the 2 Hokkaido pieces. 

Now, second time coming with my mom, because my first time with the food was pretty good, I'd have to say it was an even bigger disappointment. 

Mom asked for water, got smelly tap water instead, so we asked for hot water. Hot water came to us as barely lukewarm which set mom in a bad mood. She ordered and I got the same thing as last time, and while hers was supposedly good, mine was downright ridiculous. 

I don't know how they managed to get dirt between my cabbage, but they did, and it was disgusting biting into it. I spat it right out and didn't have the appetite to finish the rest of my food. How unappetizing and disgusting!

This establishment is like Go For Tea, they have their own dessert menu, extensive on a variety of Taiwanese and Japanese desserts, but so expensive it's not even worth it. I can't believe a slice of the crepe cake is $13?? That's ridiculous."}
{"text":"Long lineups. Waitress only speaks mandarin to you when you speak English to them. I like how they're not breaking character but sometimes it's okay to when the customer has trouble understanding you. Also they don't give you the wifi password. It would be nice to get wifi but it's not the end of the world. I can post my wechat moments with data. 

The food itself was pretty good but I definitely think service can improve"}
{"text":"TLDR: Service is absolutely terrible! Will not be back again, not sure why I waited... food is mediocre (be careful of raw meats). 

Came here on a Friday night, there were several empty tables opened and no one was waiting behind me. 5 mins later, I'm still waiting for someone to come over. 

A group of six came after me as I waited patiently for a waiter to come and give me a number, a table or... anything! Instead, he came over, looked at the group of six and said, I'll be right with you, without even looking over at me, who was standing right there, in front of the table, waiting... as you can tell, I'm super bitter about the service. 

The food? Comes super, super slow. I came here four times, and all four times, it took at least 15-20 minutes to come out. One time, they even forgot an order when it was clearly printed out, and asked for at least three times - they gave free milk pudding for the wait.. this time, I ordered NO2, which was the rice bowl with grilled beef, chicken and mapor tofu ~ it came with some raw beef (check my photos), last time, it was raw chicken... should've learned from the past! 

Anyways, compared to when it first opened, everything has gone down drastically. I probably will not find myself here again as there are lots more food places to explore!"}
{"text":"A cool spot to check out for first timers with its modern looking interior decor & lighting, and an overwhelmingly large menu of Taiwanese-inspired dishes and desserts. Dessert-wise, the presentation is there, but the flavours could use more refinement. If you plan on visiting on a Friday night or the weekend, be prepared to wait for a table or make reservations ahead of time. Extra patience for service may be needed as well. I wouldn't mind coming back to try their House Special Taiyaki, but that's only if they don't sell it by dinner time!"}
{"text":"My friend and I were excited to try this restaurant. We've seen all these great photos online. I had called prior to arriving to gauge how long we would have to wait. It was a busy Boxing Day night but didn't have to wait too long for a table. Unfortunately we were seated by the door and could feel the coldness from outside whenever someone opened the door. 

The couple we sat next to for the evening didn't seem to be enjoying themselves and all we could hear was them bickering. This doesn't make for a good night out. On top of that we were disappointed in the food; there wasn't a lot of meat with the sizzling plate, the fried chicken was way overpriced and the grilled marshmallow tasted burnt. Overall it wasn't a good experience and I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Plating of the dishes looked great.  Taste did not meet expectations.  We had one of the hot pot meals that came with instant noodles.  It only came with half of a packaged instant noodles.  Soup base was mostly sweet and a bit of sour.  It tasted like water down kimchi soup."}
