{"text":"FOOD: Yuck!  The is worst Indian food I have ever had.  Tasteless, watery and full of oil.  I ended up with a stomach ache and in the washroom soon afterwards.  

LOCATION: The location is bright and colourful.  No complaints.  

SERVICE: The owner is incredibly rude.  When we asked for extra sauce, he said we'd have to pay extra for it.  While sitting down in the restaurant, which was half empty, he told my friend and I to move over (as my friend had his knapsack rested on the chair besides him).  When my friend told him that the place was only half empty and that he'd move it if someone needs the table, the owner threatened to kick us out.  

COST: Not worth the price.  Try the Orange Snail Pub if you want a decent curry on campus.   

This was the worst dining experience of my life.  Highly recommend that people avoid this place."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in York! Their butter chicken wraps are heavenly. Their social media services are amazing as well! Owner is down to earth and food is always fresh. Never disappointing. Check it out when you're at York campus."}
{"text":"Indian Flavour is an ironically named restaurant in York Lanes.

As with many other food vendors at York University this place would probably go bankrupt if it didn't have a huge captive market of students who have sorely limited choices.  If you want \"Indian Food\" or the poor cardboard like simulacrum of it that is offered in this establishment and you are at York, well this is your only option.

If you order Mutter Paneer you get a sort of soupy slop that you will be lucky to find a few pieces of paneer in.  The owner seems to be trying to cut down food costs to the bare minimum - if you put three pieces of paneer in it you can still legally call it mutter paneer right and not be sued for false advertising I suppose.  The food again is lacking any kind of spice or taste.  The samosas are perhaps the worst I've ever had, they're totally mushy like they've been taken from a freezer and cooked in a microwave. 

For the price you pay the portions aren't great. I would give it one star, but most of the other establishments at York are so bad that in the context of the dismal state of gastronomic affairs at York U you could do worse than this place."}
{"text":"I have gone to this restaurant several times as a student at York and over the years the quality has gone down for the most part.

First the food - some of their dishes taste really good and are really well prepared. Their food is good in the morning and afternoon but usually stale and cold towards closing hours in the evening. The quality has gone down because their dishes are more watered down now and they giving miserly portions of vegetables/chicken with lots and lots of rice.

Second, the staff. This one is a hit and miss. One or two of the employees are generally pleasant to customers but a lot of them are apathetic students, quite a few with attitude problems. So beware and do not be too pleasant for disappointment may be just around the corner.

Finally, the atmosphere itself. Love the paintings on the wall and the ambient vibe of the place. The music is usually good with many eclectic songs played from the South-Asian sub-continent. One negative part is that there are just way too many signs clarifying the rules of the place. Signs, for instance, clarifying what kind of food you have to order so you can sit there and eat, or how you can't pay with any pennies or how to eat a wrap. Yes, instructions on how to eat a wrap. I understand that they cater to students but this is the only place on the entire campus with such a large litany of rules. 

All in all, I give it a 3.5/5 for the times when their food is so good that everything else comes second. Bottomline, Get take out and avoid the staff."}
{"text":"Worst customer service I've ever experienced from any restaurant. The staff are awful and give extremely small servings that are overpriced."}
{"text":"Trying to avoid ghee at an Indian restaurant is quite the challenge. So I really appreciate the fact that they label what's vegan and what's not. Combo #1 is a pretty good deal. Stick to potatoes and chickpeas. Few seats are available and the place can get crowded sometimes. Quick service. Overall it's OK if you are craving Indian food while in campus."}
{"text":"Bad service and staff and owner! To begin, the owner is completely rude and would not let me have a seat inside the restaurant because I had only purchased a wrap.. Really?.....food was not as good, the bread I got had several hair pieces in it, and one time I also had hair pieces in my food, hence it was not my hair for sure!  Worst Indian food I've ever had."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the busiest places at York Lanes because, well most of the clientele are kids staying on campus, and most of them are south asian.

It's the closest taste of home, in more ways than one (It's really close to them?)

Anyways, the only really really good items are the wraps. Those are awesome. I love the achari and the tandoori wraps.

The combos are okay, but super expensive. My friends have worked out a science on when to visit (they know when fresh stuff comes out and stuff like that. Maybe if they put that effort into their studies instead of their tummies...)

Anyways, its not the best indian food, its not the worst worst, but the prices are expensive. But York is known to gouge their students for money

Come here, try the wraps, try the tandoori combo, peace out after.

Might as well get the lassi too while you're at it, YOLO.

PS SIDE NOTE

They renovated this year. Though it looks better, it defo has less seating now."}
{"text":"I'm done with this place after 4 years. Smallest portions ever, don't do it it's not worth the money. If the Manager is reading this, please stop with the bullshit ... We know your giving all sauce and no actual food. You give me two spoon fulls and try to act like it's not filled with just two tiny slices of an eggplant. What is this. I'm usually fine with it but it's been 4 years if the same thing. I'm crying"}
{"text":"The butter chicken is amazing, it's my absolute favourite butter chicken. I also tried the butter chicken wrap, which wasn't as good as I thought it would be. I think they used naan bread as the wrap, which was a little stiff and it was dry in the outside and drenched with sauce on the inside. It was very hard to chew. The service is always terrible. Half of the time the employee is on their personal cell phone talking, and doesn't notice customers until loudly spoken to. They're not the most enthusiastic people either. If it wasn't for the butter chicken, I wouldn't be coming back."}
{"text":"I've come to this place a couple of times in the past as it seems to be the only Indian restaurant on campus, and each time I've been driven solely by my desire to have food from the homeland. I can say that while the food is as you'd expect from an average Indian restaurant, the level of professionalism and general customer service etiquette is simply nonexistent. Maybe they can get away with it most of the time, but when I can hear the employees relentlessly sharing gossip and using extremely profane language (often involving mothers and sisters) in Punjabi and Hindi, I instantly forget about my food and regret even stepping foot in the place. When I'm hungry enough, I can tolerate an apathetic attitude, and disgruntled responses, but two put two small pieces of chicken counting as an entire selection of meat on my platter is ridiculous.

What's even more ridiculous is that I had this meal two weeks ago, yet I've been restless to get this out. Next time I want Indian food, I'll be making it at home. 

2/5, because the food isn't bad, and the naan are great.

P.S. They never have the chaat/bhel puri snacks even though they advertise them on the wall."}
{"text":"Service: service is a hit or miss. The first time I came here I was quite disgusted with the owners level of professionalism. The second time I came my server was this sweet younger lady who was patient enough to explain to me the various dishes and the ingredients. 

Layout: this location was renovated this year and it looks much better. I will snap a few shots next time I remember. It is also quite clean. They serve your food cafeteria style. They have one person that rings you out and another that cashes you out .

Food: it is not the worst Indian food I've ever had but it is not the best. Nice alternative to what is offered on York lanes but a bit bland in comparison to authentic Indian food. I assume it is probably to cater to the palate of those on campus. 

Note: if you have never tried a mango lassi you are missing out!"}
{"text":"cheap food and cheap customer service .


 they haggled with me over replacing a curry overloaded with salt! 

 They acknowledged that it tasted awful but did not agree to my request to replace it although i had only one bite! asked me to dump the dish in the garbage and try next time. no money was refunded in the absence of the \"manager\". 

TIP: try before you order especially when past 4 pm."}
{"text":"The Tandoori chicken wraps are great. There is an option of getting the wrap spicy or mild. Definitely a go to when I was a student at York U. You should try the wraps."}
{"text":"The customer service is horrible! I was rudely asked to leave just a second after sitting down because I have a to-go box (so I can save the left over). And the restaurant was half empty with some people eating with their to-go box. I've been a regular customer but not anymore."}
{"text":"The wraps are incredible. I used to live across the street from York University and would go there from time to time. Now I live downtown and still make occasional trips up. They are worth every bit of time it takes to get there. 

You won't regret it!"}
