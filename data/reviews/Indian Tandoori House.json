{"text":"Pretty good food.  I went there for the first time recently.  I always find myself extremely stuffed after eating Indian food.  This was no exception.  We had Goan Shrimp curry (really recommend) and another spicy dish with Lamb (starts with M, forgot the name of the of, but it has 'Hot-n Spicy' beside it).

Decor is a bit dated, but I find Indian places generally feel that way. 

That was good too, but didn't have that curry flavour which is expected since it's not curry!   For the main orders (around $10-$12), you can actually just order one dish and share it.  The order did look a bit small, but it is actually more than adequate  when you get a couple of order of side breads (ie. roti, nan).  It should be enough if you want to leave satisfied and not stuffed. 

But given my limited experience in actual Indian restaurant (been mostly limited to Lunch buffets), from what I can see, and as someone mentioned, it is more pricey if you want multiple dishes (ie. want variety).  But for that one shot and specialized dish, it was pretty tasty."}
{"text":"A great neighborhood restaurant, with friendly family service.

When Cuisine of India closed down we hoped to find another establishment that could take its place in our hearts (& stomachs).  We were happy to find that this restaurant fits the bill.  Very similar menu and very similarly delicious."}
{"text":"Excellent buffet and love their goat curry. Very courteous and welcoming owners as well and will definitely go there again."}
{"text":"I came here for the weekday lunch buffet and i find that the chicken tandoori is definitely not good. It taste like a typically grilled chicken. Goat and mango curry is decent though. Naan's are good as well. Rice is good. If you ask me, I wouldn't come back to this place."}
{"text":"I've been here several times now.

However when I went here today it was absolutely terrible. Only one table was occupied when I went in, and there was just one server who was on the phone.

I seated myself after she pointed at a table, when she got off the phone she started counting money after about 5mins of this, I got up and went to the front and realized that there was a buffet.

Had the buffet, everything vegetarian was awful, I've had way better food at this very establishment before. The server was different from the person who normally is around, I wonder if this place has switched ownership?

I'm not going back here again."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is terrible.  We went here using a coupon from a bulk discount site, and it's no surprise why they needed to offer this coupon.  The restaurant was empty but still we needed a reservation to use our coupon.

The service is my biggest complaint.  The waiter was clueless.  If it was his first day he should have said so, but I have a sinking feeling he is a regular waiter there.  He was so very unamused at having to do this job, and it was painfully obvious.  He didn't understand our coupon at first and had to check with the management about it's validity.  He was so slow that it was a bit comical.  When we were trying to order he had to ask us to slow down - I think he was writing out the entire full name of every dish!  

Our food arrived promptly but was mediocre.  The Tandoori mixed grill was flavourless and overly dry.  The bhajis were much too greasy.  The korma was acceptable and was the best dish we ordered.  

Partly through our meal the waiter dropped a glass at the next table and it smashed.  Glass landed on our food.  He came over and _picked it off_.  He actually thought we should eat the remainder of the dish after it had visible shards of glass tossed in.  We just told him to throw it out.

We asked for our leftovers to go (against my partner's wishes).  I didn't like wasting food, even if it wasn't very good food.  When we got home we realized the waiter did not include the heaps of leftover naan or rice in the bag.  

To her credit, the manager (owner?) came around and asked how things were.  I didn't have the heart to tell her the waiter should be fired and so should the chef.  In retrospect, I feel bad for just saying it was fine.  However, she really should have noticed how slow and inept this guy was.  Her business will be in trouble if she keeps him around.

There are much better Indian restaurants quite nearby.  Even if the service had been better, I would recommend avoiding this one, even when it's half price."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Indian restaurants in the city! The food here is so good it inspired me to travel through India a couple of years ago.
The buffet runs on weekdays for lunch and on Sundays for dinner; $11.99 and $15.99 respectively. 
If you're close by, I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I just ordered delivery.... I will get to the bottom of this!!!!!!!!!!

****************************************************************

Haha wrote that about a couple hours ago.  So my story and credibility goes as follows.  I live right around the corner, and have already checked out (and Yelped) about Agara, and Earth Indian Restaurants.  I am of South Asian decent, and love my Indian food, so, I thought I should give this a go... 

So, not that I expect most of you guys to be so close to also get delivery, but my experience was mildly amusing :0, in a good way, I have a sense of humour.  Ordered roughly around 610pm....food arrives, in 1 hour and 20 min! :-).  I actually called in around an hour and 10 and the guy on the phone starts laughing, says the food is ready and he will leave right now on the way!   Pretty lax way to answer that question.  But All good.  I am hungry! 

Guy gets here (yep, same guy on the phone).  So, I gotta ask the guy why it took 1 hour 20 mins to deliver right accross the road (really?).   I ask the guy, \"what took you so long, you are accross the street!\".  He tells me the rain, that it is sooo busy (yeah right, I know how empty the place is), then, in all honesty, he says \"well, you know, small order\". 

Did you just admit that you prioritized my order because it was not enough for you?  $30 order, interesting :-)

The food?  Not bad.  I still give it 3 stars, because....it is, ok.  Ordered Vindaloo Chicken (a personal favorite) as well as my favorite Vegetable Dish (Daal).

You likely won't ask for delivery, so feel free to smile at my story and ignore it :0

No, it is not too spicy (most Indian restaurants simply dumb down the spices for you).  It is just, ok. 

Would I drive more than 15 mins to go to this place?  No.  Would I choose it over Agara.  For sure.  

Will I order again?  Only because it is accross the street, and nobody else is around.

Maybe the boys at Yonge and Sheppard need to step up their game."}
{"text":"We order a home delivery. The person on phone was rude & so was the delivery man. The wasn't cooked well, except the biryani. The tandoori chicken was ok, but the butter chicken and the nan was horrible. They are located at a good location, but taste and cost is negative. Overall just 2/5."}
{"text":"AMAZING NAAN and butter chicken here -- it never disappoints!
Tandoori chicken is very good as well - but every now and then you might be so unlucky enough as to get a dry order.
The flavours here are very authentic. 
My only complaint is that the prices are a little bit steep."}
{"text":"I really like the owner/waiter. He was fun and nice and kept talking to me in urdu which was nice because that means he thought I looked Pakistani when most people think I'm Mexican (I'm Pakistani). But I had no clue what he was saying, but it was still enjoyable. 

The food is decent. Definitely not the best indian food you'll get in the city, but decent. It's good for uptowners, for sure, as it's literally across the street from Sheppard Centre. 

It's not particularly cheap though, not insanely expensive but definitely not cheap. 

Service was good. 
Staff was lovely. 
Food was alright. 
Price wasn't great, but what to do..."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for dinner on a Tuesday night.  The place was empty so we had no issues with service.

I ordered the Chetti Chicken.  It is a coconut and onion based chicken curry. I am a sucker for coconut, so I really enjoyed the contrast of flavors in conjunction with the onions.  It came with rice and naan. My friend ordered a vegetarian dish, it looked and smelled delicious.  The server was on top of our water and Naan at all times.

The presentation was clean and simple and the service was pleasant. Nothing amazing, but definitely a good place. I will have to check out the lunch buffet sometime."}
{"text":"YUM YUM YUM IN MA TUMZ

Anyways, my friends wanted to do Lunch yesterday, and I was all for some indian buffetz. I never get to do lunch.


So we thought about going to Agra again, and then it hit me, why not Tandoori House? The reviews are great, and it has people in it as opposed to Agra which was empty.

We walked in, and were seated right away next to the buffettt. +++++++++++++++++++++++++++ for not having to walk across the restaurant.


The buffett was steaming, and a lot bigger than I expected.  Lots of veggie curries, samosas (mad stuffed!) , build your salad, achar, and them meatz. 

They had tandoori chicken (really good, as always), fish pakoras, not so great, goat/lamb curry,,,so good..goat biryani..soo good, vindaloo (chicken) so good, not spicy enough though. 

Naan was fresh @ the station, and the owner walked around with even fresher naan. +++++++


Also, gulab jamun were off the hizzle. I usually don't like indian sweets, but I ate two. 
:) 

The service was super great too. Creepy great, but great. Water was never below the halfway mark, and I chug that water bro. 

Oh comment: My friend noted that the interior felt exactly like Agra.

So there's that. 

Defo going back for buffett when I get a chance. 
SOO WORTH IT"}
{"text":"I've been here once because there was talk that this was one of the best indian restaurants in the city and that the buffet was incredible. I no longer read those reviews anymore. I first went there after 2:30 to just get something to eat because I got up real late that day. (Another great night of drinking). I had no plans on doing the buffet and just wanted to order some lamb vindaloo, some naan and some rice. Possibly a lassi too. However, they said that they were closed for after the buffet service and they didn't do a kitchen service during the day.

Well. I came back a couple days later to do the buffet. Was I disappointed. Maybe I walked in there with too high expectations. The naan came out fresh and hot each time and the curry was hot. However, The flavor just wasn't that good and the selection for buffet was not impressive at all. They had their chicken tikka masala which was decent and another lamb curry dish which was terrible. The tandoori chicken was ok. The actual chicken was a little overcooked. Well. At the least the ones that I ate. And they ran out of rice and took a long time to refill it. The restaurant was pretty packed when I went there but they never refilled my water. I had to literally grab a waiter and ask him for some more water. 

I have no plans on coming back here in the future."}
{"text":"Absolutely mouth watering but a) slow and b) expensive

We ordered palak paneer (because I laavvvvv dat ish), butter chicken and a tandoori plate with lamb kebob, two shrimps, two pieces of dark meat and 4 small pieces of white meat. And garlic naan and whatever that naan is that has a thin layer of potatoes in it? I'm sure Abbas is gonna message me and correct me on this. Whatever, I compensate for not being remotely Indian by having very Indian friends. 

The palak paneer was delicious, not salty at all but really warm and with a lot of cheese. 
Tandoori plate was good, the chicken was cooked well and you can tell that it was super duper fresh. Sizzling plate with a lot of onions. Shrimp was in shell and I was kinda upset there were only two!!! Come on peeps... Not too spicy either. 

The naan was UGGHHH SO GOOD!!!! The one with potatoes in it was so spicy, the garlic one was buttery and thin, soft and crispy to perfection. 

Butter chicken was good, too much sauce not enough chicken :(, we asked for it medium so it was bearable enough for me to eat and spicy enough for my brown buddy boy.

The service was so so slow... there were three other tables occupied while we were there and our food only started coming 25 minutes after we ordered.... a little wait never killed anyone though?

Expensive. For all of that, and a ginger ale, we paid $60 bucks. I mean it was enough to fill up two people but I don't think we ate $60 worth! 

I would definitely come back. Especially if I'm on a sexy date and he's paying. Although I don't know how smart it would be to take me to eat spicy, greasy Indian food if the date is supposed to have a \"sexy\" theme...."}
{"text":"Food here is pretty good but service is slow and portions are small.  Not great value for your money but I was very pleased with the curry goat.  They recommended the butter chicken which my gf ordered but my curry was way better.  For the price that you pay you would think they can include rice or naan but they charge you extra.  If you know what to expect this is a decent place to eat."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant today with a Groupon Now! Deal in hand
( Chilly February Saturday left my friend and I craving for some spicy food)

Service : the wait staff were friendly and courteous, were attentive and water glasses were promptly filled. ( trust me, this can be a life saver when your food is fiery hot )

Food : We ordered the Chicken Briyani , Karahi Lamb , Naan and Laccha Paratha. The breads tasted authentic, no complaints. But the chef was a little too generous with the masala in  the Karahi lamb gravy making it unbelievably fiery and I had to down 6 glasses of water just to wash it all down with the breads. 

The Briyani was a terrible let down.  It seemed like the chef just mixed together precooked rice with briyani gravy and unceremoniously dumped the wet mixture on a plate to be served to us. The spices and masalas tasted raw and it was easily the worst briyani i have tasted yet. 

Not going back. :("}
{"text":"One of my favourite Indian restaurants. The staff are friendly and helpful if you're a first timer they are able to recommend the most \"popular\" dishes. I have been there numerous times for dinner around 6-8pm. The service was good and the food was great. 

I've tried the Chicken Curry, Mushroom Masala, Tandoori Chicken, Goat Curry and Butter Chicken- all dishes were amazing. The naan was authentic and very good. I would recommend this place to my friends."}
{"text":"This place is just OK. I have been there twice and was not impressed. Last time I had Butter Chicken ($12) that I asked \"very mild\" but it was more than medium spicy, I also ordered Masala Chai ($3) (that I usually order and love) but this time I could not taste any spice - it was just milk and black tea.. Very dissapointed. Looks like it was my last time I will go there.
They also do not have parking (kind of they have at the back, but its always full.. but the place is empty). There are lots of better places than this."}
{"text":"I bought a coupon from Group Click, thinking I'd have a good excuse to try a new Indian restaurant.  Located only steps away from the popular Agra Fine Indian Cuisine restaurant, Indian Tandoori House faces some stiff competition. There are a number of pan-Asian restaurants in the neighborhood but this place was suspiciously empty.  Even more suspicious is that this place has been in business for 23 years (according to the website) but still has no reviews to post (the website states that reviews are \"Coming Soon\"!)

Upon entering, my friend and I were asked if we had a reservation (in spite of the place being nearly empty). Maybe it was just the humid weather that day, but service seemed to run at a snail's pace.  She was friendly enough, but it felt like we were waiting forever after placing our order with the waitress.  The discomfort of waiting was compounded by blatant stares of  the restaurant owner and his friends, who seemed to find it incredibly entertaining to scrutinize customers. 

The Indian appetizer platter was good - a standard samosa and a decent assortment of other classics.  I was really looking forward to the garlic naan bread, but was disappointed when it was (finally) brought out - $4 for 4 tiny, slightly burnt pieces...I ended up ordering another so my friend and I would have enough to share.

The best dish we ordered was the Goan shrimp curry, which had the perfect balance of sweet and savory coconut deliciousness!  The chicken tikka masala tasted fresh but  felt it lacked something - it seemed a bit more bland than I remember.  I wish I'd ordered the butter chicken, which apparently is their specialty, but I don't think I'd want to spend so much time waiting again."}
{"text":"I haven't had indian food in the longest time.... prob. over a decade. 

We ordered the Jalapeno Pakora (Seasoned jalapeno and cheese fritters), Butter Chicken (my bro keeps raving about indian butter chicken i just had to try this safe dish lol), and the Tandoori Chicken.

The appetizer was a tad steep imho. It was a good dish...however it was SO SPICY! I needed my tea, water and almost any liquid at that point :) 

The Butter Chicken was delish & so tasty. I personally thought it was better than the Tandoori Chicken... We also ordered the rice & nan (garlic). You could pick from a few flavours for the nan... I love that pita looking bread :) We were hella stuffed by the end.

Price wise it was moderate. I wish it were less. It seemed authentic here...however I prob won't know until I experience a few other Indian restaurants :) 

Service was alright. Decor was a tad dark & a little dated. Don't wear your good sweater here."}
