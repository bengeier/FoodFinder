{"text":"Super friendly service, great coffee, good grilled cheese and the owner loves football.  What else could I ask for?  Pretty much gave us the remote to the tv to pick the games we wanted to watch.  They provide complimentary flavour shots which goes great with my Americano.  My picky Italian buddy doesn't just go anywhere for his espresso and he's a regular here.  I had the Jersey Shore grilled cheese which was yummy.  And the prices are decent.  Wish he had a T-Dot location.   Cafe Moka over a starbucks any day of the week.  If you're out in this neck of the woods and need a quick bite, this be it."}

{"text":"I am easy.... easy to please??   Cafe Moka is a solid cafe for me to chill...   Friendly and Nice Owner - Check  Free Wifi - Check  Organic Coffee - Check  Great Selection of Loose Leaf Tea - Check  Choices of Made to Order Sandwich - Check  Comfy and Laid back Vibe - Check   Devine Swine ($4.99)  - Cheese Please... More Cheese Please  - One of the 7 variety of grilled cheese sandwiches - Black Forest Ham, Smoked Bacon and Cheddar Cheese was really good... I wish I can have the whole thing.. as I was hungry... Feed Me!!   Moroccan Mint Tea and Salad ($2.50) add on as side  - Salad and dressing was so so.. but good to have some vegetables... I ate it all..without Sharing.. but I don't think my Yelp friend is into salad eating anyway...  - I always enjoyed Morocaan tea especially with a drizzle of honey or you can help yourself with a shot of whatever in the drink..  Cappuccino ($2.50) charged as an add on  - I would have a hard time deciding what to order if I would have know that Cafe Moka made the cappuccino the way it is..with a nice microfoam giving it a really velvety texture..   Eating and Yelping and Checking in and reading the talk forum did make a nice lunch... but am I ignoring my lunch date?   CBC News? Not CP24?... Boo from my Yelp friend??  BTW, if you are into Montreal Bagels, the owner import them directly from Montreal... hmmm maybe I will have a bagel next time!"}
