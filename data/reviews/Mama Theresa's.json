{"text":"It's hard to believe that a place that has had a grand opening and has been open for two full weeks would be assembling tables during lunch time on a Saturday, and lacks any highchairs, but that was the case at Mama Theresa's in Tega Cay. When the owner was questioned about the lack of highchairs, he noted that they were on backorder, and that customers have requested them every day since they have been open. Don't try for delivery yet, either, even though the menu says they offer it. According to the owner, they don't have their Point Of Service program in operation, and until that happens, delivery isn't an option.  Pizza, as a food in general, is usually pretty good even when it isn't the best, and Mama Theresa's is good enough. Veggie Lasagna served in a portion large enough for three is also middle of the road, but for the price, is acceptable.  Located in Graystone Crossing in the former J & S Butcher Shop space (let's pour one out for the dearly departed butcher homeys, please), outdoor signage is banners, and the interior d√©cor is sparse. Most of the wall art is promotional posters for pasta sauce, which indicates that they don't make their own. If memory serves, though, those posters might be remnants from the butcher shop, which sold fresh pasta and sauce. So, they are either advertising that they don't have house made sauce, or they have pictures of another business's products. Neither is particularly good for their image, which at this point seems a bit commitment phobic. Here's hoping that as their new buisness kinks are sorted, the experience at Mama Theresa's will improve."}
{"text":"Just OK. Kind of disappointing. John A. maybe has never had real NY Italian. If you've got an extra 10 min go out to Luigi's at Steele Creek. Now that is authentic NY."}
{"text":"I noticed the same review in  other food posting sites. I guess a competitor is trying to squash Mama Theresa's. I have had their pizza and other items and they are very good. I recommend you give it a try. I would hate to lose a good quality new restaurant here because of strategic negative reviews."}
{"text":"Very average/ below average food and experience.  Would try some place else if you have the chance.... Had the sicilian pizza and was not overly impressed- it was a bit doughy (no flavor) and the sauce was \"institutional\" tasting.  Would only recommend in a pinch... if nothing else was open.  Staff was very nice!"}
{"text":"Seems like they closed up shop on Dec12' chairs were being put on tables at 5pm. Seems like the store is bad news for whoever rents it tho it's in a good spot. Best pizza for me is still Tonys in Ballantyne."}
{"text":"I debated on whether to give this a one star or a two star. I'm going with a two because I didn't get up and leave in the middle of my meal (but, I kinda wanted to!).   I was pretty excited to see a coupon for this new restaurant show up in my mailbox, even though they weren't open yet. I'm all for a mom & pop authentic NY Italian restaurant opening up within reasonable distance of where I live. The fact that there isn't a decent one already is mind blowing. It's disappointing that there still ISN\"T a decent one!   My first experience was take-out. I ordered fettuccine alfredo with grilled chicken and broccoli. I asked if it came with bread, and they said yes (I'm a big fan of crusty Italian bread). I got home and can almost without a doubt confirm what a previous reviewer's suspicions were: they buy their sauce. If they don't, they need a new recipe, or a new cook, or better quality control. It was pasty and flavorless. My chicken was definitely not grilled, and the broccoli might have been steamed for all of 30 seconds. The bread it came with was a .5 inch slice of whatever they use for their hero's & sub's. Not heated, just wrapped in foil and kinda mushed up.   This first experience was just a few days after their opening, so I'm inclined to give them the benefit of the doubt. I figured the REALLY lame wall decor (suggesting they use a sauce purveyor) was a temporary thing. I mean, the whole family was in there late at night, dad behind the counter, all the kids folding boxes, you can tell it's a family affair, and one that means a great deal to the owners. So I gave it another shot.   This visit came well over a month into their existence. I visited during lunch hour, and it was dead, which isn't a great sign. Same cheesy decor. A young woman (girl, actually), was working behind the register, and the music piped into the restaurant was definitely her selection. I had to sit through the entire lunch listening to really really crappy teenage girl music. Not ok.   We ordered sausage parmigiana subs and fries and sat down. It took a LOOONG time for the food to come out. Over 20 minutes. The only other customer had a slice of pizza, so it's not like they were slammed, plus they had 2 guys working the back. Our subs show up and after the first bite I knew it was all wrong. The sausage used was the shipped-frozen, pellet sized balls thrown on pizza. I really, honestly, couldn't believe it. What kind of restaurant can call itself an \"authentic New York Italian Restaurant\" and send out a sausage parmesan sub with little meat pellets? I could have gotten better at Subway, and I absolutely despise Subway. The flavor was relatively non-existent, the bread was blah, the consistency sucked. There's really nothing good I have to say.   I will not be giving Mamma Theresa's the \"3 strikes\" courtesy. 2 strikes is really all they deserve. It's a shame too. I can't see them lasting until the fall at this rate!"}
