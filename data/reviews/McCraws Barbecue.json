{"text":"The best smoked barbecue around! Became a must go every weekend, family, kids and dogs friendly and next to the kids place. The brisket is from heaven!"}
{"text":"Oh boy! We've known about this spot for one week - and we've been twice - It's our new Saturday must eat spot!  I've got to be honest - I don't like brisket - I rarely order anywhere bc it's usually dry and lacking flavor. But THIS brisket has me waking up on Saturday morning dreaming for noon when McCraw's starts selling! Juicy - packed w flavor - amazing bark/crust - and it falls apart w a fork. Even my 10mo baby could chew and chow down on this delicious brisket! Pair it with some of the best mac and cheese around - and WOW!   The brisket taco is next on my list!!  Love this location in front of Crafty Beer Guys w picnic tables and plenty of shade on these hot days of summer.  Cheers!!"}
{"text":"How this place has only one review is beyond me. We ordered a pound of brisket, it was moist flavorful and quite frankly the best I've had. As much as I live the Charlotte local bbq favs, this place is in a different level. Because they're not producing for the masses the quality is like if yo neighbor was smoking. Highly recommend!!"}
