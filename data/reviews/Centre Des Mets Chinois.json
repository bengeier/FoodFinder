{"text":"Not good at all. Slow delivery, food bland and tom yum soup outrageously priced (5$ for a small cup) and was inedible. Burnt egg rolls, soggy everything. Yuck."}

{"text":"this place is turning into a mess. on two occasions now they got a part of my order wrong but offered to bring me what i ordered. I expected them to bring me the entire order and take the crap that they originally delivered, but they didn't. They just brought me what they had gotten wrong, a half hour later. Which means that the food that I originally received was cold by the time I received the completed order, a half hour later. Total wait time was an hour, half of it wasn't edible anymore because it got cold and gelatinous. such a disappointment. Also the people on the phone are rude as hell."}
{"text":"Just finishing up dinner from here right now. I ordered a wonton soup, chicken with broccoli, and steamed white rice. I asked for Lo Mein noodles but they don't make that so maybe this will get me to try different things. Person I spoke to on the phone spoke clearly which was nice. Delivery was prompt. Wonton soup was good though there was more broccoli than chicken in the main dish! It was a large portion and I think that next time I see if I can get a size smaller. A good first experience. Oh, before I forget, also not too pricey..all of this only for eleven dollars."}
