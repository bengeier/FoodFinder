{"text":"Salmon Tartar - 5/5 - Crunchy an creamy
Shrimp Vegetable Tempura - 5/5 - crunchy and not soggy
Hamachi - 5/5 - Loved how it came with its own sauce
Sushi Rolls (boston, spicy salmon...) - 4/5 - Traditional rolls that were well made

First of all, Olivia who served us was amazing. The service was impeccable and she was truly outstanding. 

I love how the appetizer rolls came with its own sauce. The presentation was amazing, as seen in the pictures. Everything was truly delicious and I would definitely go back. 

Highlights: Salmon Tartar, Hamachi, Tempura. 

Highly recommended and definitely one of the best sushi restaurants in the west island. BYOB, and if you forget don't worry, there is a Depanneur in the same strip mall."}
{"text":"Had a craving for sushi this evening and hubby didn't want to head to Mikado or Uchi, and he found Katoreya. A great find, sushi and sashimi as fresh as it gets, service was first-rate, Mark did the owners proud and we will definitely make this our regular sushi hangout on the WI."}
{"text":"We came after the rush on Sunday evening. This is one of my favourite local places to go to, so I am immensely disappointed to write anything negative about this little 'resto\". We all have bad days, and this probably was it. Upon arriving with my 22 year old daughter, the waiter seated us and placed 1 wine glass on the table. I guess he thought she was under age. He could have easily requested identification and we would have been happy to do so.
We ordered the sushi for 2, and it comes with a 'dragon eye' entree. It was cut so unevenly, placed in such a sloppy fashion that I had to wonder if this was the chef, or an assistant. The main plate had the usual 'chef's choice' of rolls, that were overly 'ricey' and not tightly packed. This was not consistent of what they usually serve. Our bill was $50 before tax, and it's a hard earned $50., not sure if we will return so quickly. :-("}
{"text":"Our go to place in the west island for sushi.  A great selection and their specials are to die for."}
{"text":"I don't understand how this place has gotten such high reviews. I went in expecting a 4.5 star restaurant but was very disappointed. First off, they brought us tea in a pot and this is the first time I get charged for tea at a sushi place. The tea tasted like water. And the soy sauce tasted like water, we had a strong suspicion they water it down. It was horrible. And you really needed the taste of soy sauce to help you out because the rolls themselves tasted so bland. One of the rolls we got I think it was the siren, was basically a salad. A salad without any dressing. Just a bunch of mint leaves and a cm sized shrimp. 
The waiters, although polite, kept hovering around us and made us uncomfortable. Oh and they also charge for ginger and wasabi (it doesn't even come with the specialty rolls order)  they also brought out our sushi two orders at a time instead of all at once which I didn't like. 
Also, each roll was the size of my hand. Please make your rolls smaller and bite size! Don't make it impossible/embarrassing for us to try to chew/choke on it. 
In the end, for three people,  our bill came out to $100. Pretty outrageous for less than mediocre sushi.
I definitely disappointed my guests by bringing them here based on reviews. Yelp did not come through this time unfortunately."}
{"text":"A top quality fusion sushi restaurant, very artistic presentation and always a delightful tasting experience.
Just got better with the new \"Bring your wine\" concept!
We are sushi lovers... having tried some of the higher-end sushi places around -usually bigger restaurants- and we find the quality to be equal with top restaurants, only at a more decent price.
Plus the place is smaller, very cozy, in a quiet area.
Never disappointed so far!"}
{"text":"Great option if you happen to be laid over at the Montreal International Airport. For the record, most of the reviews said tapas so I thought I was ordering tapas. Turns out they're full courses. I'm certainly not complaining. The Tofu App was delicious. I also liked the Seafood Udon, although I thought it was Soup, it has lots of veggies and seafood. They deliver and serve healthy portions. Don't expect a 5 Star dining experience, this place is a tasty, hassle free, option near the airport."}
{"text":"I really like it and I am a choosey kind of customer. Compared to other Japanese restaurants in Montreal (or Canada for that matter), Katoreya prepares a slightly more traditional variation of Sushi (which is a good thing for traditionalist like me). Still they come up with some innovative variations on the Japanese tradition. 

For example, their salmon/shrimp roll, called \"Indochine\", is like a spring roll wrapped in a rice leaf; tasty and original. They managed the challenge of preparing excellent Ama Ebi, Ika and Tako. These three ingredients were very fresh, delicious and usually reveal whether the chef knows his trade or not. 

The service was kind and attentive but not intrusive. When asked a question about a special dish the waiter did not know the answer but politely referred to the chef for clarification. Well done. One doesn't need to know everything but instead needs to be classy enough to find out from someone who does. 

Setting is subdued but not stark as had been mentioned before. In fact they livened up the place with a few colorful decorations (which are not exactly my taste). Cool lounge music makes you relaxed. 

I will come back in one of my next trips to Montreal."}
{"text":"OMG, this place must be good as 
I created a Yelp account while atthe  restaurant!

Started using Yelp a great deal wherever I travel, helps me find these diamonds in the rough.

Although, there was only 4 reviews on this nice little place, they were unanimous enough to raise my curiosity.

The service was second to none, Being an absolutely sushi (sashimi please!) maniac, I am constantly trying to find the best one when travelling.

Hit  a great one here....

I let the onwer guide me through a series of fantastic suggestions, from sake, to appetizers (try the jade, not on menu, ask for it!), to mix sashimi, to dessert. Once owner found out it was a keener, he went crazy on great suggestions.

Can't wait to go back, but this time with a group of friends and get a great spread going...so many things to try there!

Good work chefs!"}
{"text":"Interesting place, just mediocre sushi, nothing special.   Hard to figure out the rolls, as they have all custom rolls.  I went with the Dragon Eye and the Phoenix (pics uploaded).   Staff is friendly but do not speak very good English.   Soda is by the can, which earns them negative 10 stars, no ice too, damn Euro style."}
{"text":"Small restaurant tucked away. Very impressed with the presentation and variety of selections. The food is melt in your mouth fresh and delicious. We liked that we could bring our own wine and found that their selection and prices for wine is very reasonable. We will definitely go back. Worth the money."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is a bit stark...but the food more than makes up for it. This is proper Japanese food. Despite the myriad number of sushi shops on the west island, this restaurant knows what they are doing. 

Good tasting sushi in inventive combinations are a hit. They do sushi well...quality rice and nice fish. The platters are generous and they will cater to your likes and dislikes if you ask.

But don't miss the appetizers. I is worth ordering several...including the crispy chicken strips! Have been back several times and are working our way through the menu and enjoying every bite. The bill always comes as a surprise in that it is reasonable compared to the usual crappy west island sushi fare. 

And they have a decent selection of hot and cold saki at reasonable cost. 

Looking for a birthday dinner with friends and family? Try this place."}
{"text":"I have a feeling these guys can do nothing wrong. 

Ok..the decor is not thrilling...the mall is lame around it...but the sushi is eretheal. 

It was a quick night pre-movies. Service is so friendly and personal..and even with the specialty rolls ..so fast. 

Weird quirk...I LOVE the wine glasses. Lol. If you go to other bring your own wine places..they have chunky, horrible glasses. This place has great glasses. 

Where else can you get this quality of sushi (with fancy rolls)for two starving pesce-lovers for around  40$??? 

Go. I'll probably be there. With my blood test panel for mercury poisoning."}
{"text":"Had a lunch with my brother as he was craving sushi!  Place is nicely decorated inside.  We both ordered Moriwase lunch special.  It came with a good size salad and miso soup.  Both were delightful!  Moriwase (assorted maki and a couple of rolls) was very generous sized.  My reference point is Toronto and Vancouver sushi places so I'm usually a little jaded when eating sushi in Montreal.  I find Montreal sushi places lunch is near the $20 amount with tip whereas in Toronto/Van you can usually have a good lunch for around $15.  This had good flavour, fresh and was of good size to fill you up!  I can't stand it when you go to a sushi joint and you leave hungry!  This was not the case! Perfect amount!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.
I especially liked the Thon Tataki--perfect for someone who is eating clean and healthy and flavorful.
Cucumber maki and unagi nigiri were especially good.
Skip the tiramisu--just sweet."}
{"text":"I was very impressed by Katoreya. I normally grade the quality of my sushi by how many pieces I can eat before I hate myself. We ordered the chef's choice for 2 (34 pcs. for $32) and came very close to finishing it.
The decor is modern and slightly reminiscent of Maiko. On all fronts, my date and I were both very satisfied from the experience."}
{"text":"Didn't expect much and got a lot 
Don't judge a book by its cover
The food was amazing"}
