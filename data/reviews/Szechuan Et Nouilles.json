{"text":"If you like bad chinese food, you'll love this place. It's one of those everything-tastes-the-same kinda places. Even the fortune cookie was boring; it said, 'have fun tonight.' 

Got delivery, kung pow chicken and s&s pork (though it could've been a shoe for all I could tell). Right now, I'm lying in bed, hoping I won't have terrifying weird protein-induced dreams, clutching my stomach. Have fun tonight, indeed."}
{"text":"I was out of my expectation.  Food there is super cheap but tastes very good !  I had general Tao and the soup, i was full for the whole day."}
{"text":"Very friendly service but sadly the good really left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Getting decent Chinese delivery in the city is quite a treasure hunt. Szechuan et Nouilles offers westernized Chinese favourites (fried rice, breaded meats in sweet/sour sauce, etc). With this in mind, this restaurant is a go-to for me when I'm craving this type of food. The prices are quite cheap and the servings are pretty large--and I've never gotten sick, which is a nice thing.

I enjoyed the garlic broccoli, which was fresh and tasty. The general tao chicken I was not a fan of, but the general tao tofu is a great option. Their imperial rolls are large and pretty good although a little greasy.

This restaurant won't satisfy those looking for more authentic Chinese food, but for what it's worth, I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"i love the general Tao there it is simply the best i ate !! maybe i need someone to prove me wrong  .. and my second favourite dish is the  sesame beef , both come in the special menu with imperial rolls  and  soup (won-tong or sweet and sour ) 
the sweet and sour soup is simply delicious !!  i never order anything else  !! my gf love the general Tao tofu .. my 2 cents"}
{"text":"Food came quickly but not for the good reasons. Both meals were mushy and had weird bits in it. If you're looking for a quick bite, great, otherwise try a different place. Pretty disappointed even if it's rather affordable."}
{"text":"I used to go here all the time when I was in my senior year of high school. I would either order the general tao chicken or the chicken fried rice. It didn't taste amazing, but it was better than cafeteria food. Plus, it was super cheap and they give big portions.

The service was always really rude. Because I was getting it to go, they would charge me extra and they would always scowl when I wanted plastic utensils. 

Although it wasn't the best, it was a big part of my last year of high school so I can't rate it as completely bad. The chicken fried rice was actually pretty good. Just didn't have enough chicken."}
{"text":"I'd walked by this unassuming restaurant numerous times on my way to the bank and always wondered if it would compare to the Chinese food in Hong Kong, where I just moved here from. The answer is no, but it was so much better than I EXPECTED. It is the perfect fix for your typical, quick and dirty Chinese food craving. Pretty above-average quality for that calibre if you ask me! Good and FAST, friendly, and competent service too. I'd go back for sure and will be doing so soon."}
{"text":"Excellent and ample food for the price. Prefer them to e.g. Maison VIP in Chinatown. Most of their business seems to be for pick-up. Exceptional General Tao tofu and S&P tofu; Singapore noodles; orange or lemon chicken. Best paired with desserts from Cheskie next door."}
