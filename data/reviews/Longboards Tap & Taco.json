{"text":"We went for a late lunch on a Saturday afternoon, there were about 4 other tables that were occupied. When we walked through the door, there was not one staff person on the floor.   We waited a few minutes for someone to come out and greet us, which should have probably been our first clue as to how the experience was going to be.  We sat down and our server came over (who was very nice, just clearly not very informed) to get our drink orders and tell us about the menu.  We ordered the 'mini enchiladas' at least I believe that is what they were called, what they really were is the frozen Mexican egg roll that you get somewhere like Chili's...dissapointing to say the least, especially for $8.50.  I wanted to order two different tacos, but they don't allow that....why I don't know.  But they have what they call a 'sampler platter', which is chef's choice each day.  I ordered that with 2 tacos, since our waitress told me that it worked out because the two I wanted were 2 of the 3 that were available that day. Problem solved...or so I thought.  She came back a few minutes later saying that the tacos went in a certain 'order' so i couldn't have those 2, I would have to order the 3 tacos to get the two I wanted. I agreed, since my boyfriend would eat the one I didn't.    The order then came out and it was 3 of the taco I didn't want....I informed the person who brought them out, who I believe was the manager, she said she would take them back and bring me what I ordered. Then she came back and said that our waitress was clearly having a problem with communication, because the 2 tacos I wanted were not in fact the tacos on the sampler platter.  In the end I just ordered 2 tilapia tacos. They were dry and didn't have any flavor, there was more red onion on the taco than anything else.  We really wanted to support a new local business, but I can safely say that with all of the other great places to get tacos around southend we will not be returning."}
{"text":"My family and I were craving tacos, but didn't want to go to the original places that we've been going to. I remember a client raving about Longboards and decided to get it a go. The atmosphere was relaxed and family orientated. We ordered chips and salsa, steak taco, chicken taco, and the veggie taco. All the food was amazing. I definitely recommend Longboards and I can't wait to take my boyfriend the next go around. I enjoyed their black beans with rice. It was different and not your traditional runny beans covered in rice. The tacos all had wonderful zesty flavors and I like the fact that you can choose from different types of salsas that they have to offer when you order the chips. Next go around I want to try their fish tacos since the server recommended it. Cool concept and I felt like I was at the beach with the surf board decor."}
{"text":"I'm honestly really confused by some of the other reviews I've read on here.  Longboards has awesome bartenders, very involved and friendly management, and absolutely amazing food.  Best tacos in town (and I didn't even think I liked tacos!).  Please do yourself a favor and check it out."}
{"text":"Found this gem during a trip to Charlotte! The location was awesome, lots of cute shops surrounding it.   Great vibe and decor was really interesting. Surfboards painted by local artists were hung on the walls. Staff was very friendly and they were excited to have some out of towers visiting. Impressive wall of beers on tap.   Food -WOW! The tacos were delish. Go for the Carne Asada or tempura avacado.  So many choices and the homemade pico was my favorite.   There were these little plantain cups filled with different fillings that were also sooo good. Try those for sure.   Finish with the fried Oreos for a grand finale! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We were excited to have a taco joint in the area - but unfortunately we will not be regulars here.  The staff is extremely friendly - opening the door as we walked in and a waitress taking our drink orders immediately - but the servers cannot make up for the sub par food.  We had coconut shrimp that was over cooked - followed by my husbands pork tacos that to me looked canned - and he said did not taste much better - not to mention the double corn tortillas could not even stay together.  Move on to my grilled mahi taco that somehow was extreme greasy. I also had a side of plantains that were more like burnt saut√©ed bananas than plantains - though my husbands fries were good.  So we may be back for a cocktail - but not food.  Oh and one last note - the decorations are very beachish - but the music was not - it should have been old beach music - Beach Boys, Steel Drums, Bob Marley etc..."}
{"text":"Pros: Thurs. NODA local brew $3 Tacos were tasty, typical Americanized Mexican tacos. I guess my expectations were high being from CA. I miss the Mexican taco shops from SoCal. None the less staff was friendly.        Cons: The service was pretty slow, considering it wasn't a busy Thurs night. My sauces I ordered on the side did not come with the meal and had to asked for them and got straight sour cream and tomato sauce. So, I had to AGAIN reorder the correct sauces that came with my tacos. Lastly, I thought the food is a bit over priced. 3 tacos for $15...2 tacos for 11.50. Also,"}
{"text":"Former Picasso's, then Sutton House, now it's Longboards. I had high expectations for this joint because I live in the neighborhood. The staff was very nice. The beer wasn't as cold as I would like, maybe I had a new glass straight from the washer or they just tapped a new keg, but my beer wasn't cold to my liking. Seems like another unknowledgeable person in the restaurant industry try to make it with one big bang. You have to think to yourself, do you want one big cash out for the first opening days or do you want frequent regulars that will generate money through time. First of all, your competition is Cantina which is fairly popular ($12 for 3 tacos with two sides) and Moe's a fast food taco/burrito joint ($7 for 3 tacos). You can't be coming in Dilworth thinking people are rich and would pay you $12 for 2 tacos and $15 for 3 tacos (which comes with ONE tiny little itty bitty two bite side of your choice). Your tacos just aren't that good to be worth being a regular or to eat while there's competition down the street that tastes better. Your chicken tacos are dry and not much seasoning. Mind you these tacos are very small. What were you thinking generating this menu prices? Are they organic stuff? Are your avocados imported from the depths of the jungles of South America harvested by a tribe?  Do your research, I'll pass."}
{"text":"We had a great experience here.  Very cool atmosphere.  The Southern Fried Tacos are absolutely amazing!  Love the homemade tortillas.  We look forward to going back."}
{"text":"First of all  I am not a fan of any Mexican place that charges for chips and salsa. The Street Corn is awesome and so are the two types of veggie tacos. The other stuff is okay. I don't eat meat but my meat eating friends weren't really impressed. They said it was good but not great. There kegs are often tapped so don't get too excited about a particular beer because they may not have it."}
{"text":"This place is OK. Chips and salsa are great. Margarita not great. I think it might be a pre-mix. Our drinks took a little too long for a non-busy day. I had the surf and turf tacos. They were good, but I've had better. Plantains were not that great. i think they add brown sugar to them which is super unauthentic. Beer selection is not great. Overall, I was a bit disappointed. The meal wasn't bad. I just know a couple of much better Mexican places worth revisiting."}
{"text":"Really wasn't too impressed.  The service was lousy and the food was mediocre.  Probably will not return."}
{"text":"I went to Longboard's for the first time on a Friday night. As is typical with the area, parking can be an issue. However, the area was dead and I found street parking immediately. I was surprised how slow they were for a Friday night with live music. The musician was great and made us stay there longer than if there was no live music. I was unsure if I wanted to try out their food and ordered chips and salsa to start and give more time to look over the menu. They gave us a choice of two sauces. The server recommended their pineapple salsa and the salsa verde.   The chips were a little on the stale side. The pineapple salsa was good, but it was a little to spicy for my taste. I did not care for the salsa verde, something tasted off and the consistency was not pleasant. It had the consistency of pureed baby food. Unfortunately, it did not give me that appetite to try any additional food.   The restaurant itself, I liked. Very laid back, good service, and they have a decent selection of brews. I know they just opened, so I plan on going back in a few weeks and trying out there food and will write another review."}
{"text":"UPDATE LONGBOARDS HAS CLOSED 10/15/2013   Have been looking forward to Longboards coming to the neighborhood. Finally went on a Wednesday night, and was underwhelmed. Bad first impression when we had to walk past an employee in red shirt smoking right at the front door, but, was greeted by a friendly hostess, and was seated immediately.   Took a few minutes to browse the menu, and settled on a burger, only to be told by helpful waitress that several things were not available, including all burgers and sandwiches. Decided on tacos since that is Longboards tap and Taco. The taco was OK, but not a signature item, in my opinion.  The interior remodel from Picassos and Sutton House was minimal from what I saw, still pretty dark, except for one area by the bar that was well lit.   Heres hoping this was opening week jitters, will probably give them another shot, since so close and a quick walk away.  UPDATE  10/6/2013 Living in the neighborhood, I walk past Longboards very often and am surprised by the few diner I see inside eating. Several neighbors are taking odds on how much longer they can keep their doors open.With Cantina, Moes and now TijuanaFlats,  opening soon, in the old WADS location, all within walking distance, a few blocks away. See where they are giving free chips and salsa now, hope they get their act together soon, or else...."}
{"text":"Man....I really wanted to like this place....again. I had high hopes for these guys making a difference and shaking off the expectations of many, but, alas, I'm proven wrong. First time in, the food was stellar, the service was decent, and the entire experience promised for more future visits. Well, that ship has crashed and burned. Hard.   Came in for an early dinner and sat at the bar. We were pumped after our previous visit so we figured the rest of the menu had to be promising. Not so much.  I ordered the baja burrito. Yuck. It was so bland and glittered with overpowering cumin flavor. A sneeze of black beans, weak, dark meat chicken, and, the worst decision of all, was that it's pressed. NOT the best flavors as the tortilla was rather burnt in places. No thanks.   We ordered the guac to share and it was fine. They did say \"made to order,\" though. It was freezing cold. Flavor was fine, but disappointing for the price/serving size.   Worst part? The service. Goodness gracious. The bartender tried to upsell us on salsa with our chips not once....but THREE times. Come on, man. We didn't want it the first time, so no need to try and drive up the ticket price. Really annoying and rather unprofessional.   I'm knocking off a star for this place. Only reason it's 3 and not 2 stars is because the Mexican Street corn is still awesome and the pablano shrimp tacos are pretty good.   Other than that, I don't see a visit happening again in the future unless something drastic changes. Just left a really bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Came to this place for brunch.   I've seen this location go from Picasso's to Sutton House and now to Longboards.  The place has a great location but just can't keep something (just like the location next to Lebowskis).    Chips and salsa are free.  Sunday's batch tasted better than Saturday's batch so I guess that means it is fresh.  The Brunch menu has only 4 items which concerned me at first, but they have the full lunch menu as well.  I opted for the plantain appetizer which was awesome but had a ton of cheese.  For brunch I had the pancakes foster.  It was quite sweet and tasted how I expected.  Service was good, but their beer prices seem a bit high (I think it was $6 for an OMB Copper).  Maybe I just missed the meaningful beer specials, but aside from that Longboards has potential."}
{"text":"The food, beer selection, and service were a-okay.  I think my dish was called Costa Rica Kabobs?  Anyway, the whole experience for me was ruined by live music that was WAY TOO LOUD.  Too loud for us to have a conversation and we weren't even sitting near the speakers.  I really want this place to succeed so I will try to go back, but not on a night with live music."}
{"text":"Don't really review, but since it's a new business and had a great experience, thought I'd do the place justice.   Great tacos, really fresh and tasty! Little pricey but not bad.  Good selection of draft beers and decent prices.  Friendly staff that need a little more time to get comfortable, but they have only been open a week so understandable.    Had great time. Will be going back to try more tacos!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here on a Friday night with our 15 month old toddler. Probably won't be coming back, unless they make some changes.    First impression: host and hostess were friendly, seated us right away, got us a highchair immediately, and asked if we needed anything for our child. Off to a good start...  We were seen immediately by the waitress (Taylor I think) and another girl she was training. Both were nice, friendly, and full of smiles. Taylor tells us their \"special\" today is a $4 Kona Longboard draft. Thinking I missheard I asked her to repeat that. Nope, their beer special is a $4 draft. That's not a \"special\" folks, that's just a normal priced beer. On the plus side, however, they had a pretty good beer selection, though with no prices on the menu I think they failed themselves there. It's not a nice enough place for a no-price drink menu.  The chips and salsa cost $3.75 (which is $3.75 more than every other taco place I've been to in my life), but we ordered them anyway because they came with \"bottomless chips\" and our choice of 2 salsas from a list of 4 or 5. The chips were light and actually pretty tasty, with no complaints about either of the salsas. That is until we ordered a refill of our \"bottomless\" chips, and were told the chips were bottomless but not the salsa. Ummm, ok maybe you should have said that upfront. 75cents for each extra salsa. We felt tricked, which instantly put a bad taste in our mouth, even before the mediocre entrees did the same.  Before we even ordered our entrees, we felt they were $3-$5 overpriced. For example, $12 for 2 corn tacos, $15 for 3 (though it does come with a side). For carb-watchers, they offer lettuce-wrap as a taco option, which we felt was a smart move, along with traditional corn or flour. I got the corn, my wife got the lettuce wrap. Unfortunately, both were so poorly put together that we had to eat our tacos with forks. Shout out to the service, they fulfilled our high-maintenance order of 2 different 2-taco entree choices, each with 1 lettuce wrap and 1 corn wrap so we could split them. It's too bad neither taco was very good (we got the carne asada and tacos el pastor). For sides, my wife got the mexican street corn, which was by far the best thing we ordered. GET THIS SIDE. It's delicious. I could have skipped the entrees and the salsa and just gotten like 5 of these and been happy. I got the jicama radish slaw, which tasted like undressed shredded lettuce and carrots. I saw neither jicama nor radish. DO NOT GET THIS SIDE.  Here's what we would tell the management if they had a \"contact us\" option on their website: 1) Reduce entree prices by at least $3 2) Always offer a reasonable drink special, even on Friday nights. 3) If you offer bottomless chips (and charge for them), also offer bottomless salsa. Otherwise your patrons will feel ripped off and that feeling will not go away.  Bottom line: we probably won't go back anytime soon, but if they're still around in 6 months we'll check the menu to see if they've changed anything and potentially give it another try at that time. We live nearby and would love to see them be successful, they just need a lot of work and hopefully are reading reviews, taking advice, and adapting accordingly."}
{"text":"The fella and I had been tossing around trying this place for awhile, but the Yelp reviews were so iffy that we were nervous.  However, I snagged a coupon, and we visited on a Wednesday right after work.    We got the Burrito Slammer appetizer ($8.25 for 4), which was light and flaky with a good amount of smoky meat, corn and beans.  We both agreed it needed a little tang or something, but solid overall.    I got the Tacos Al Pastor for dinner (2 for $10), and the pineapple salsa gave me the tang I'd been wanting to balance out the smoky pork... however, it did also make the corn shell pretty soggy.  I got the plantains on the side and... oh, the poor plantains.  I don't know what they did to them, but they were in a weird, brown, sugary sauce and the plantains themselves seemed dry and overcooked.  It made me miss Viva Chicken.  The fella got the taco sampler (2 for $11.50), which came with the Carne Asada and Tilapia.  He said both were surprisingly good, but the Carne Asada was better.  He also got the side of Mexican Street Corn, which was fried and on a stick.  He said it was flaky and buttery.  We were also glad to see local breweries represented, and he got a Triple C 3C.  I got the house margarita and it was fine.  Onto the bad.  So, I can't tell what the vibe is supposed to be.  I can get on board (no pun intended) with a California surfer vibe, but the decor doesn't really go with it - bright, loud colors and the bass so loud in the Sublime songs they were playing that I was afraid a speaker was gonna blow.  There was a Jack Johnson song every now and then, but I don't wanna hear thumping bass at 6 p.m.  When we left, there was a live musician setting up; in such a small place, it seems like that would've been loud.  Glad we got out before that happened.  As others have said, the parking is a little tricky.  We parked at Berrybrook, but since it was 6:00, they were still open and you can only park in some of their spaces after 5:00 but before they close.  We went inside to check, and they were super nice about directing us to a spot, but it's still just an annoying space overall.  And the worst... we both got a dirty feeling from the place.  They have a 96 rating (we searched for it before we ordered), but my silverware had something on it as did one of the appetizer plates they brought us.  And I certainly don't want to be hateful on a review, but their wait staff - although super nice and attentive - did not seem clean at all.  I'll leave it at that, but we won't be back.  Bummer, dude."}
{"text":"I preach the gospel of Longboard's Tempura Avocado Tacos. These things are FANTASTIC!! The tacos are generously portioned with avocado, roasted corn, black beans, tomatoes, cheese and cilantro sour cream and the tamarind sauce that they drizzle on the tacos is to die for... yum!! I'm also quite partial to the plantains and their pineapple salsa.  The service is friendly, the atmosphere is fun, casual and beach-y. I've eaten at Longboards many times and the food has consistently been delicious and I've always had a blast.  Give this place a shot. You'll be pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"This place has excellent tacos. By far the best in Charlotte that I've had. Definitely better than Cantinas down the road. They taco shells are a slightly crispy California style tacos that are crispy and delicious. I tried the fried avacado taco which was excellent. Along with the carne asada taco and the fish taco. The fries are amazing. They're the breaded ones that everyone loves. The Mexican street corn is excellent as well make sure you try both these side items. I didn't really like the beans and rice tho. The desserts are nice they offer goodies like fried Oreos. Try it out! Unfortunately they are closed on Sundays I don't know why"}
{"text":"Nope.    For starters, we had to send the guacamole back because it was way to salty to eat. And let me make it clear that we are not the kind of people that send food back! The waitress replaced it with queso. It was nothing memorable.   I ordered the taco salad which was mediocre. The biggest problem was that it had that God awful guac all over it.   My boyfriend had the Mahi fish tacos. The fish was cooked well and the tacos were decent but again the guac made an unwelcome appearance. Luckily it was in a glob so he could scrape it off.   The best thing on the table was my margarita. It was $4.00 on special. Prices were reasonable but we were not happy that we were charged for the replacement queso.   The atmosphere was nice. It had a California/ surf vibe. The bar seemed like a chill place to grab a drink.   We had to park across the street in an little store's parking lot because the garage in the building specifically said that Longboard patrons would be towed.   We won't be returning."}
{"text":"I really wanted this place to be awesome. But I'd say average. Mahi tacos were good, but they don't heat their corn tortillas, so they immediately rip apart on your first bite. Ate a taco with a fork. Honestly, a taco place should know how to make a taco right.  My husband thought the flour tortillas were too buttery and meat seasoning wasn't interesting. Fries and street corn sides were delish. Beer bueno. Service ok, but our server refilled my friend's Dr Pepper with water, completely forgot. The servers should try to look more put together as well. Over $100 for six people was a little absurd for quality and amount of food.  I'd rather go to Cabo fish taco."}
{"text":"We hit up this new place in Dilworth on Saturday night and was pleasantly surprised by the interior.  It defintely had a kitschy, surfer-girl/boy, Mexi-Cali feel....something unique for that part of town.  We had some local beers (which A+ for draft beer selection!) and in honor of Cinco De Mayo, some tequila shots.  The host, upon our arrival, told us that we had to try the fried oreos and if we didn't like them, he would comp them for us....SO of course, we had to try them!  :) They were tasty (my first experience with fried oreos, actually) ,but could've used more oreo and less batter.  Our friend ordered one of their burritos/tacos and they looked delicious and fresh.  Next time I will ordering food from the menu.....and of course will be yelping it about it as an update :)"}
{"text":"Sigh, was so excited but...  So, the bar was the best part.  It had a great beer selection on tap. The rave reviews end there.  Strike 1 - seriously. No Coors Light? (Not for me, but this should be a staple) Strike 2 - did I stutter when I ordered because this is not what I ordered.  Strike 3 - food was eh. Strike 4 - Bathrooms were inoperational. Had to walk down the street to another restaurant  Strike 5 - so my actual bill is higher than what is stated on the slip you gave me?  Conclusion - I hope this was opening jitters but I will probably not be back for food. Saving grace was the bar and will definitely stop back in for a drink."}
{"text":"The food was fine, but the service glacial. Not sure about a return visit."}
{"text":"We was sorta looking forward to eating here and hoping for good things. I have to say the art and things inside is really neat and they said all from local artist.      The service was sorta slow and they wasn't that busy when we arrived. Beer could have been alot colder( I judge alot on cold beer!). We started with the cheese dip and it wasn't bad just nothing that is going to blow your socks off you know.   We did tacos and they was just so so and sorta bland tasting, they do stuff them full of meat/fish etc.. Just was hoping for more flavor I guess. Not sure if we will return but it was worth a shot , hard to find good fish tacos in this town."}
{"text":"Had attempted and failed at trying this place once before (only because they were closed when we tried to go), but man was I glad to make it back.  We came on a pretty gorgeous day via bike from the green way so we were already pretty thirsty and famished as soon as we walked through the doors.   It was about noon so a small, lazy Saturday crowd had started trickling in.  Whoops, let me back up - when we were locking our bikes up to the sign outside, the couple that was exiting was raving about the food.  Awesome sign #1 that we were in for a good lunch treat that day.  Ok - back to it... we were seated promptly and our server introduced herself.  Started out with waters and then got into the beer list.  We were also waiting for a friend to join us so we weren't really in a rush.  I did notice that it did take a while for the food to come out once we finally ordered.  It was well worth the wait though!  I went with the taco sampler (3) tacos off the menu for $15.... Tried the  Southern Taco (deep fried chicken),  Mahi Avocado Taco, and BBQ Tuna.... all were very tasty and had it's distinct flavors.  Each one was pretty delicately prepared.  Almost as if Longboards had taken taco making to the next level of fancy...... if the word fancy could ever be associated with a taco.  I was super happy with the food and beer.  As far as atmosphere, feels like a beachy, surfer hangout.  There is some questionable surfboard artwork on the walls, but over all a decent vibe.    In my old age, this corner of East Blvd and Kennilworth has seen many a bar/restaurant come though.  Hopefully Longboards is here to stay for a while."}
{"text":"No idea where all these bad reviews are coming from - we had a great experience at Longboards tonight. The food was fresh and delicious, great beer list, friendly and attentive service. Very family friendly atmosphere, but can imagine it as a great bar as well. Loved it! we'll be back."}
{"text":"Had the veggie tacos and fries. LOVED the fries! The tacos had a variety of veggies on them and they weren't bad, just very messy to eat. I would likely choose another place for tacos in the future, but may be persuaded to give this place another shot for the fries."}
{"text":"Shopping on East Blvd should be a competitive sport.  Longboards served it's purpose for refueling me in between stops.  The Likes:  Convieniently located next to my store-crush. (Petal)  I loved the laid back vibe and the island music that they played.  They really try to get the theme right from the food down to the decor.  I think they did a pretty good job of that.  I just needed a quick bite so I ordered the street tacos.  They were really good.  Prices were only $2.95 a taco, too so that's a plus!  The dislikes:  The salsa.  I had the mango (or was it pineapple) salsa and it was less than bland.  The other salsa (it was red) and I think it was supposed to be normal was just bland.  It had a hint of sweetness which would have been awesome, if the other flavors matched.  It was almost right....needs a different combo of flavors.  They weren't that busy.  I wouldn't say that this makes it a dislike but the waiter had absolutely nothing to do but stare at us and every time I looked up...he came running over. -__-  So, a tad annoying.    I'm hoping this place sticks.  It's a nice option to have with a good price point."}
{"text":"I can get past the lack of parking given the area, I can even overlook the fact that I wanted to eat here on a Sunday and they were closed. I think that might be a shot in the foot considering it's a restaurant in a walkable area and many people are out and about on the weekends, but I'm not a restaurant owner so what do I know? But there are a few things that I just can't NOT comment on.  First of all, it's a taco joint and chips and salsa do not come free. You have to pay for chips and salsa that, frankly, taste like they came from Costco. Definitely not freshly prepared.  My biggest issue with Longboard's though: the service. Holy moly. We had a party of two and our meal took an hour and a half. On a Monday night. And it's not like the place was slammed or anything. Geez! I could have caught my own fish and made the tacos myself at that rate. It was terrible. The food was ok, but definitely not worth the trouble.  The only saving grace was that we happened to go on Monday night when they offer beer flights for $3.50. Thank goodness for the beer."}
{"text":"I don't plan on returning. The food was disappointing. The services was just ok. And you have to pay for chips & salsa with your $12 tacos. Give me a break."}
{"text":"After having an overwhelmingly positive first experience here, and preaching the gospel of Longboards to all who would listen, it's time to recant.  I don't want to die a martyr for a restaurant I don't believe in.  Here's what happened. We stopped in just after 5pm on the day they opened. Everything, with the exception of the strange salsa situation (they don't give you much and they charge a lot for it) was wonderful.  The food was great, the service was attentive, and we were impressed with their draught beer selection. I ordered the tempura avocado tacos and LOVED them. The Mr enjoyed what he ordered as well.  And that's where the good stops.  Yesterday evening, we stopped in after calling to make sure that they had power. We sat at the bar and ordered ginger ales to drink. Driving on all those curvy roads to circumvent the downed trees and intersections without traffic lights had made me both hungry and queasy. But the ginger ale tasted weird. The ratio of syrup and carbonated water was way off. This portended much of what was to come.  We chose to order the guacamole, since it supposedly was made to order. Um, no. It wasn't. It tasted okay, but wasn't anything to write home about it. And the chips were BORING. Plus, our server/bartender tried to convince us to buy salsa for $.50 no fewer than 3 times throughout our meal. What?  I ordered the tempura avocado bowl, since I had enjoyed it so much in taco form just a few weeks ago. The Mr had a chicken burrito with \"baja\" fries. Hmmmmm...bland. Everything.  My bowl had rice and beans (which were okay), diced red pepper (didn't really go with everything else) and a TON of minced onion. There was some dairy-laden sauce on top. But the true travesty was the tempura avocado. The tempura batter failed on every level. It was not crisp. Not flavorful. It added nothing to the bowl. And the flavor of the avocado was just wrong. I ended up pushing it all to the side of the bowl because I couldn't eat any more. Which surprised even me, since I'm an avocado lover.  The Mr's burrito was forgettable, except for the high concentration of cumin, which made it harder to forget. Oh, and the \"baja\" fries? Just french fries with some supposed lime salt. All we tasted were fries. Such a disappointment.  I'm sad. I wanted this place to be great. I wanted them to create a culture of fun and great food. They've done neither. My verdict: save your money and go somewhere with creative menu items, good prices and a consistent experience. Not Longboards."}
{"text":"I should have trusted yelp, My bad.   To be fair Dillworth is a very competitive restaurant environment, and while Longboards would often be par should I be looking for a taco out in a rural burg there are numerous far better options within a mile or two.  We were starving and in the mood for some casual fresh cali-mexican and I had plans nearby. Newish place and figured I would stop in. \"Do you want some chips?\" Sure thanks for offering 3 minutes later \"Here are your chips, the chips are free but salsa is four dollars\" Huh... Every Mexican dive I have ever been to gives you free salsa, I have seen higher end places charge for premium guac or great tomatillo salsas... so this food must be higher end than I expected...?  It wasn't.   Regrettably I have experienced more flavor at Chi-Chi's before they poisoned the nation. This was overly safe tex-mex at its most dreary. My burrito did not have a taste of any seasoning whatsoever, that isn't hyperbole, no cilantro, no salt, no spice, nothing, it had to be half a pound of rice punctuated by occasional bits of anything else that I later drowned in hot sauce to be anything but a wrapped pile of monotony. My wife's taco arrived cold and also uninspiring/unbalanced. The price says quality Mexican food but the food doesn't come close to what we can get from food trucks for six bucks in this city. it wouldn't compare close to favorably with Qdoba again for half the price, to compare it to the great restaurants nearby that give you far more quality for the same price isn't worth explaining.  +1 star for the beer selection/bar. Lots of good microbrews.   Good location and good beer make me hopeful they can step up their game to be on par with downtown Charlotte... or even better that they provide a real so-cal experience. Hire a ringer with a good palate. Family friendly doesn't and shouldn't mean bland."}
