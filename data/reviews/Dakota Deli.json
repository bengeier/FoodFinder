{"text":"You would never tell from the signage, but Dakota Delhi delivers a delicious Ethiopian one two punch! Wander if for lunch one day and you will see scribbled on a small white board - Ethiopian, $7. The lovely woman will load you up a container of homemade Ethiopian food and top it off with your choice of traditional injera, regular white bread, or chips.

The variety rotates, and she goes to the back to scoop up the dishes. On my first visit she noted beef and chicken but being vegetarian I was not disappointed. I left with a very full container with five different dishes. I've seen various types of saucy lentils, a potato dish, beet dish, carrot dish, spinach or collard greens, braised cabbage dish. Always with a small iceberg lettuce and fresh tomato salad on top.

The dishes are well spiced and complex in flavour. Be warned if you are a 'grease' phobe as there is the stereotypical amount of clarified butter involved that you see in homemade Ethiopian but this just serves to marry the spices in these long stewed dishes. You can avoid most of it if you push the lentils to one side for example. Injera will soak up all that delicious saucy goodness anyway.

I have yet to try the falafel, (which is why I initially went in there) but the entire menu is reasonably priced. Falafels and donairs run $6. She has a tray of homemade cookies every day, and a drink cooler with a large selection.

You are able to eat-in here, with 3 tables to fit 4 people each. It is nice enough with green plastic tableclothes and some plants to lend some cheery atmosphere. These seats may be more utilized in the evening hours, as there is often nary a line-up in this tucked away location. If you are doing take-out, I'd suggest bringing your own container so that you can spare the traditional styrofoam."}
{"text":"The owner is very nice and the food is fantastic! My favorite is the 'Ethiopian Dish' its a mixture of tasty veggies and meat with large Injera bread. Healthy, inexpensive and freshly made!  Gluten-Free & vegetarian options too!"}
{"text":"From an overall perspective, it's your typical average mom n pop resto, with big-size portions to compensate for its decor.  Served w/ Tostito's chips, a bonus ;)

An interesting menu of your donairs, falafel plus some western BLT, club house...

Nice family service."}
