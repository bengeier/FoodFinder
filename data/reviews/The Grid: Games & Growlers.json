{"text":"You're a bar in Mesa..... and you charge a cover to see a shitty dj who just curated some Spotify playlist. Plus tell people before they buy several drinks for there friends that you don't serve real liquor instead serve some water down crap that taste like ass. If you happen to live in the butthole of the valley that is mesa this a ok bar to go to but don't come here from anywhere else in the valley it's waste of time and money."}
{"text":"I love this place, it has games and beer. What else do ya really need?....How about LIVE SHOWS!! The staff is friendly and very helpful. Got a beer and hot food served up promptly."}
{"text":"Such an awesome spot! Free game play with the exception of a few. Excellent local craft beer on draft. Enjoyed talking to the owner. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars vs 5 is because the food is less than desirable. Mostly frozen food, which the bartender admitted to, and food was overly priced for what it was. Next time my husband and I are in town we will definitely come back and geek out again."}
{"text":"It's worth the trip no matter where in the valley you reside. They have a very competitive selection of craft beers on tap, really fun events far outside of what you expect from a normal bar, and an awesome combo of both old cabinets, emulator/MAME cabinets, and even some ultra rare cabinets like Killer Queen Arcade.

If you're a fan of Synthwave (an 80s inspired music genre) they host live performance events from both local and national acts."}
{"text":"Awesome place if your looking to just relax and have some fun with the buddies, good drinks, really amazing food. Better than a lot of restaurants. They also have vegan food if anyone wants to know. Free emission except a small 5$ fee on the weekends. Ohh did I mention most of the games are free. Overall a nice hidden gem in Gilbert"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE The Grid. As a non-sports guy, it's hard to find a bar that truly speaks to me. Well, this is it. Discovered The Grid was right down the street from my house, a couple months after it opened. Old-school arcade cabinets, free emulators with just about any system you can think of, board games, pinball, graphic novels, cards against humanity, craft beer, live music, geek themed events, video games and cult films playing on the tvs ... plus it lives up to its namesake, as the bar is done up Tron-style. It's the best part of my childhood and adulthood, all wrapped into one. Also, every other Monday is Rock Band night, which is an absolute blast!  I HIGHLY recommend The Grid!"}
{"text":"I like this place but it has some issues. Not everything works. Otherwise the staff is great and the food and drinks are good."}
{"text":"Upsides: Their beer and beer alternatives were great and they had a good selection. I liked that they carried Koffee Klosh, Not Your Dad's Rootbeer, and a myriad of ciders.
They do have an old school Nintendo set up on a small table with all of the old Nintendo games. Nothing like womping your boyfriend at Dr. Mario! The board game selection was OK. Mostly older games but a few newer. Most for 4+ players.

Downsides: The set up is a bit haphazard and unkempt at times, looks kind of like a nerdy basement with odd and mismatched furniture with sticky surfaces. Not awesome when you're trying to play tabletop games and the table has not been cleaned at all. Some consoles work and some don't. 

However. I am sure with a larger party it would have been a bit more epic."}
{"text":"I'm old school. . This place is weird. . But super cool.. gonna be regular. . Pizza is great.."}
{"text":"My bf and I have been meaning to come here for some time now and my only regret is not coming sooner. All the staff was lovely and prompt and extra hands came in as the night became heavy with guests. The music was great, the guests eager to dance, play and chat around in and outside. By standers enjoyed the excitement and casually drank or joined in. There is definitely a sense of community among gamers and music enthusiasts alike. The staff, and especially the chef Jessie are proud of what they offer to those who enjoy games, beer or cocktails and food. Vegan options are plenty and staple bar snacks are available for your enjoyment along with a great selection of games of all kinds, arcade, console, pc, and board. You cannot get bored here unless you really don't like games or booze. It has something for everyone especially since most games are free. Pricing is on point, especially if you consider the free games. All in all it has a nice dive bar/ grungy basement game room feel that is quite comforting and welcoming. You can zone out in a game surrounded by music or socialize and dance with others. Negative reviews are most likely from those who just don't get it. Lovely place I will come back to time and time again."}
{"text":"Great happy hour spot for anyone who enjoys vintage games, arcades, and a little bit of nostalgia! 

We stopped by here on a Friday afternoon around happy hour o'clock, and we were pleasantly surprised to see that there wasn't a long wait for the games and it was not too packed. There is a decent selection of craft beers available, so it's a pretty good spot to come grab a beer or two. About 1/4 of the games were broken down, which was the only downside to our visit. But it won't stop us from coming back again!"}
{"text":"A cool place for gamers,  it with inattentive aggressive security.  
This was my first, and likely last, visit to the Grid.  I entered and looked around for someone to check my ID, as there is a sign outside the door indicating they check ID.  The only thing I saw was a table with a man sitting with his back to the door playing on is phone, I waited and tried to get his attention, but was ignored.  Clearly this guy was one of the patrons as he was ignoring the one thing a door man is supposed to do, and I started looking around for a bartender so I could show my ID.  The next thing I know I've got a hand on my shoulder pulling me back and yelling \"ID!\", it's the guy who was on his phone.  He walks me back through half the entry way, never removing his hand from my shoulder as I smile and hand him my ID, which he looks at.  I apologize and explain that I tried to get his attention previously, and this is my first time, but he was on his phone, to which he responded \"FIVE DOLLARS!\"  To be clear there was no line, there was no one waiting in need of him.  He was just rude for no reason other than his own incompetence.  
Apart from that the wait staff was incredibly hard to find, but to be fair they were really slammed, and the gentleman who I think was the manager was incredibly polite.  
Live music, very loud.  
The barcade has classic bar games as well as free old school arcade boxes all the way up to current gen VR games.  
If I hadn't been accosted by incompetent security on the way in I might have liked this place."}
{"text":"I like the grid, everyone is nice and friendly here but they are a little green on the food service and cocktails as not everyone in my group gets their food at the same time once our order was completely lost. 

They have a fantastical amount of games to play and allows me to play stuff I don't want to buy at home. I only wish they had a cocktail menu and not just beers or infusions."}
{"text":"Pfffft. Thought this would be a neat place to hang out with friends. My husband is allergic to beer, of course that's all they have: GROWLERS.  I realize it's in the name, but we really thought they would have another alcoholic choice for those who don't typically like beer. Serving only beer really limits your customer base.
Lots of broken games. Lots of console games. Overall, disappoint info. I can play console games at home whenever I want. Food was typical bar food. 
Good concept of a place, but needs some fine tuning. We won't be back any time soon."}
{"text":"Best beer selection in Mesa!  This is reason enough to go in my opinion.  However, from a gaming perspective, you will definitely leave disappointed.  Although I like this place - since gaming seems to be the main draw, I have to dock a couple stars for the sake of honesty.

Both times I went (over a year apart), about 75% of the games we tried to play simply did not work.  At least this time, most of the games are free or included with a food or beverage purchase (last time we lost some money on unplayable games).  Regarding the broken systems - employees attempted to help, but usually ended up giving 10+ mins explanation of why the problem can't be fixed (or share their frustration having to work in a place with broken machines).

EDIT:

The owner contacted me with more info.  I think 3 stars is accurate, perhaps generous, given that gaming is the main draw.  Since I spent the time to write out a response to him, I thought it was only right to share it with the Yelp community as well:

Here's what we tried:

1)  Read the game list, saw NBA Hang Time.  Asked to play.  This led to about 20 minutes of an employee setting up the Raspberry Pi which eventually did not work.
2)  Tried to play TMNT.  4 players were already selected despite 1 player being taped over, so we had to wait for another employee to restart the machine.  Then we chose two of the players which were not taped over.  The controls did not work for one of the players.  We waited for an employee to help us restart, but they were all occupied.  So we had to give up.
3)  Tried to play the racing game behind it.  Despite being two of the same game, they are not networked.  That was surprising, but OK we tried to play the two games separately.  One of them worked but the other, the accelerator was broken and unplayable.
4)  Moved to next room and attempted to play pinball.  This sort of worked, but eventually bugged out and stopped working.
5)  Played the gamecube.  Some of the controllers were broken, but we were able to get this to work.  Spent rest of our time with the gamecube.

So out of the 5 games we tried, 4 of them were unplayable.  That's an 80% failure rate.  I don't think anyone is going to leave happy after an experience like that.  However, the beer was good..."}
{"text":"Had a great time talking to a new friend on a Monday here. Food was great, prices decent. Everything about the place was just nerdy enough for me to feel at home. Did I mention that most of the games were set to \"free play\" since it was Monday? Well although I didn't get to take advantage of this feature to the fullest - they were.

 I plan to come back soon!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! fun place to go out and spend an entire nigh with some friends. Great selection of beer, tasty food, and an amazing selection of console games. Bring me back to the days of classic gaming and hanging out. Good music but it can get a little loud at times. would recommend to my friends."}
{"text":"Was pretty cool the games little out dated not working all that good but good orices on beer"}
{"text":"This place is a portal back into your childhood if you happened to drink while playing Mortal Kombat at 9 years old. My wife and I wanted to do something different on a smoldering Saturday afternoon. We were going to drive 30 minutes downtown to Cobra Arcade before we found this place on Yelp. Great service and cool people.

Just as cool and so much closer for us, East Valley folk! Consoles everywhere from Sega, Super Nintendo, Neo geo and everything in between. Old schools arcade games, free pool, and live entertainment. Tuesday is trivia night which we will be back to enjoy and the food was solid as well.

Full experience of entertainment for every age but especially the adults. Go relive your youth at The Grid."}
{"text":"Great place to hangout! Tons of games to play, interesting beer choices, and an open mic on Wednesdays with music and standup make this a great option for a date night."}
{"text":"My wife and I popped into the Grid for a few craft beers, some bad ace Killer Queen, and a good time once, and we fell in love. They have such a large and varied craft beer selection (big selling point to us craft beer folk), it's really impressive.This is such a quality place to hang out, my wife and I go here all the time now. By far the best Barcade we've ever been to in the United States. Their owners and employees are so sweet to us, they always take good care of us.  #love"}
{"text":"This is a great place to hang out with friends, get a drink and play some video or board games. They have a live DJ on the weekends playing techno style tunes. They also have a very solid selection of craft beers at a reasonable price. Happy a place like this is in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place is great. The Arcade games are free, except for pinball and Killer Queen. Killer Queen is free on Thursdays though. They've got a huge selection of beers too."}
{"text":"Way cooler than I expected friends liked the food (bar food) drinks were pretty good and the games were fun."}
{"text":"This place had a good thing going and a great concept and I have enjoyed this place in the past several times BUT apparently they have changed and definitely not for the better. WHY would you scan customers driver licenses for arcade play ...there is NO reason for that especially with all identity theft going on right now.  Also apparently now there is a 2 drink minimum which I think is ridiculous for an arcade place even if you have a bar in there  (this is not a comedy club) now I have been there several times and have always ordered a few drinks along with food but when I am rudely told hey you know there is a 2 drink minimum within 2 minutes of walking in the door makes me definitely NOT want to buy my usual food and drinks. I liked this place and liked coming to play the games and spend time with friends but I wont be back with the new rules and attitude, there are just too many other places that actually want my business without ridiculous \"rules\" and rudeness."}
{"text":"The shining star of this place is the staff. They are very helpful and friendly people, they answered any and all questions we had and checked in to be sure we understood how everything worked. 

The good of this place, aside from the staff is that most of the games were free. However, quite a few were broken, which is unfortunate but I understand does happen.  They also have a great drink selection. 

However, felt a bit dirty to be honest. I don't know if it was because there were a fair amount of children running around (which confused me since there is a sign about being 21+) or what. I sat in a chair to play a video game on the game cube and it was soaking wet, I think/hope it was beer."}
{"text":"I really like this place!

Besides the friendly staff, and fairly chill crowd; there are quite a number of games on here that are still quite fun to play.

My daughter and I were barcade hopping, as she was showing me her haunts. 

Apparently, she is some type of Killer Queen prodigy along with her posse. She proceeded to explain to me how the game is played, and it is definitely best played cooperatively with people you can trust to not do anything stupid!

There was a fairly large group hovering over this game since this was a free play night. They seemed relatively calm and reserved for such an intense game. 

My daughter knows that I am a FPS game player, and my idea of cooperative playing to telling everyone in my team what to do, and loudly voicing my frustration due to their lack of compliance. And then after the game, I return to my regularly calm self! :)

Such was not the case here @ the Grid. It was an overall laid back place, surprisingly fun for the few games that she and I did play, and I definitely understand why this is such a draw to hang out at because of the great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I hosted a party for my husband's birthday here last weekend and had bought a couple Groupon's for VR. I emailed them to reserve the VR and the manager, Matthew, was so nice and even set us up with a reserved table when I only emailed a day in advance. Everyone had a really great time! The bartenders were super nice and helpful, food was good,  and drinks were a great deal! The arcade games and VR was perfect for our gaming group. I highly recommend checking them out!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday night with my boyfriend. It was really busy, but we still managed to find games to play. It took a really long time to get a drink. So long that while waiting for the second round, we decided to cash out instead of order food. The food looked and smelled good, for what it's worth. 
I was confused by their \"age policy\". 18-20 year olds aren't allowed (because it's a bar after all! As their sign points out) but apparently they allow children? There was a family there with maybe 4 kids who were running around and screaming the whole time we were there. Personally, I'd MUCH prefer the 18-20 year olds. 
It seems like it might be a fun place during the week when it's maybe not as crazy."}
{"text":"What a fun place! Neat idea and extremely friendly and welcoming staff! The manager introduced himself and the service was outstanding.

They have games and a cool light up bar. We played Cards Against Humanity and had a blast. 

The only downside is that they don't have any domestic light beer and only have white wine. That may not be an issue for most people...but is for me.

Their menu is a little limited, but offers a surprising number of vegan items (like 9 or so). I ate a burger, which was delicious and all of my friends really liked their good as well and it came out quickly. 

If you're looking for a fun place to hang out, this is a great little spot!"}
{"text":"This place is so awesome! I went here to with a few friends and was so impressed. The place is huge and there are tons of games to play. The staff took really good care of us. They set up the virtual reality game (which was super fun btw) and came back multiple times to help calibrate the controls when we wanted to switch players with no issues and all smiles. We talked about coming back once a month and bringing our families when they're here to visit. I recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"We love to come out to The Grid for beers and Free-Play nights (usually $7 for all you can play arcade games).  This place is (mostly) run by Trish and Mike.  Say hello!  They're awesome! 

5 stars for: Friendly Staff, Craft Beer, Killer Queen & GravitreX!"}
{"text":"Pinball's a rip.  Nice machines but $1.25 per credit is crazy.  $7 for a beer is also bonkers."}
{"text":"Best bar I've been to, and best arcade. I haven't seen anything like it & I am thoroughly impressed. Definitely my new hangout spot."}
{"text":"Our first visit was this Mother's Day.  I took my mom out for some VR gaming.  This was our first time there, and our first time VR gaming.  My mom LOVED IT.  I believe the owner was the one helping us out. He was extremely patient with us, and he taught us how to navigate through the program.  We had a blast and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Great place! Slowly becoming a regular here. The games are fun and the drinks are good. It's a wonderful mix of board games, old school arcade cabinets (think TRON) and newer games as well. They do also have console games. Great place, can't say enough good things about it!"}
{"text":"Ordered several drinks here late one night with friends and played several games. On my last drink the female bartender asked me how I would be tipping. Ummmmmmmm. I opened a tab and kept it open. 4 6 dollar drinks later and she asks how I'm planning to tip the bar. 
I noticed she didn't bother to ask anyone else that. 
Gave the lowest tip possible and left. 
I'm normally all for tipping out my bar and servers but to be basically asked to tip is absurd. 
Funny how she only asked me and not any of my male friends. Who's drinks I also paid for. 
Great drinks. Great games. Great male bar staff. Awkward disrespectful female bar tender. She earned her resturant three stars with that stunt."}
{"text":"The staff is super amazing, they might look at you funny if you sample all 24 beers on tap and various combos but they never were rude or didn't give me another sample. The food is amazing and pizza deluxe fries are delicious. They recommend tap hunter app to see what's currently there since it changes a lot, but you can always try a new beer with an ipa slot and multiple ciders and porters and stouts and a nitro tap. They may not have your craft beer on tap but they always have each type on tap in an amazing way."}
{"text":"I like how they have board games because I grew up playing with board games rather than control games. Many of their games are old though, they don't have many cool games so it got boring after an hour already. Their oreo shake was really yummy. I didn't like whoever was karaoke because it was way too loud and very annoying. I wish they had the machine where you can pay to select your music or just play something off spotify/soundcloud/pandora. My ears were gonna blow off everytime the guy would scream and try to hit a high pitch. The place seemed like in someone's house garage and have a wanna be band singing so loud it's unpleasant. I really like Dave's and Busters more or game works."}
{"text":"These guys put their heart and soul into this place. Cool place for drinks and games. Great choice for a team builder event."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME. I am so happy there is finally a place for us old timer nostalgic-for-the-80s-and-90s folks like me to go hang out, play videogames of literally every possible kind, a generous helping of arcade machines, home consoles, and game-themed local beers to enjoy while I play!

Bars don't really appeal to me, and this place took the bar concept and made it COOL. Hell, even if videogames aren't your thing, there's a nice big pile of board games and card games available to entertain even the toughest customer.

It's clear these guys had a vision of what kind of clientele they wanted to serve. And I am happy with their vision! Come play some Cards Against Humanity with me and my friends sometime! We're making this a bi-weekly thing for sure!

Oh, and we had fun filming here, too.

{"text":"Walk into the grid and so so impressed by the video games.  Cobra arcade is much better but this is ok  the bar was good but waiting over 20-30 for chicken wings is ridiculous order chicken wings and fries  got the fries first but apparently they were appetizer and our wings was last meal which was weird. After fries waited 30 min for the wings. Approach bartended and was told they were getting done next 5 min finally the wings came  let's just say they were cold and been probably sitting in the window for 20 min  approach the manger telling him that they were cold never got a \"sorry about the wings nothing. Just got out money\". All we wanted was warm wings and some communication. Also place was dead So it shouldn't took that long for our food and saying that your fryer was being changed is a lousy excuse"}
{"text":"Contrary to what younger people think, while the term \"barcade\" may be new, the combination of bars and arcade games are most definitely not. In fact, they were once synonymous with each other - like douchebags and tribal tattoos. Believe it or not, there was a time when practically all bars had a row of arcade cabinets or pinball machines available for people to play. During the early 90s, when under-21 entry laws were a bit more lax, I'm not ashamed to admit that the majority of my pinball skills were honed inside seedy and smoky saloons. Furthermore, my first exposure to fighting games like Street Fighter II and Mortal Kombat, as well as pinball favorites like Funhouse and Twilight Zone, all took place in the bars that my borderline alcoholic relatives would loiter during the weekends. They knew that as long as they provided me with a fistful of quarters, I'd leave them alone with their vices for at least a couple of hours.

So, while the concept itself isn't exactly new, it's merely being showcased differently. Rather than a stack of games buried at the back of a bar, they're now the primary attraction. The booze and bands are merely bonuses.

Being a big fan of Starfighters Arcade, I wasn't really sure what to expect at The Grid. I've always liked the no-nonsense approach to Starfighters, which reminds me more of those dimly-lit arcades you'd once find in every shopping mall in America. The Grid, on the other hand, is a bit more flashy. Yes, there are pinball machines and arcade cabinets, but there's also live music (on select nights), board games, pool tables, consoles hooked up to TVs, and a bar for those who want to eat/drink. 

I'm not really a bar guy and feared it would be a \"standing room\" that borders on breaking fire codes, similar to what it looks like over at Cobra. But the crowd was fairly small and everyone seemed pretty chill. 

From what I've gathered, activities and \"specials\" seem to vary based on the night you attend. I was told that all arcade games, with the exception of Killer Queen, were free play. Unfortunately, the pinball machines, which is where I usually spend the bulk of my time, required you to pay upwards of 1-2 dollars for a couple of games. On the plus side, their pins are extremely well maintained due to sourcing out through a local vendor. The downside is that it's just more gratifying being able to plop down ten dollars and freeplay all the pinball you want (a la Starfighters). The main reason we came here was because I was tipped off that they had a Wizard of Oz pin on the floor. Unfortunately, it was out for servicing. Other pinball games they have include Lord of the Rings, Iron Man, The Walking Dead, and Street Fighter II (pin).

Their selection of arcade games isn't quite as vast as I had imagined, but my girlfriend and I were able to do a full playthrough of the classic TMNT ('89) that brought back memories of my days frequenting the local Pizza Hut. We tried Killer Queen, but that's clearly only fun if you have a large group. We particularly enjoyed the fussball table and giant jenga blocks. Additionally, it seems like it would be a great place to gather with friends for some board game fun as well.

Ultimately, we both agreed that we feel more \"at home\" at Starfighters, where we can just play what we want without second guessing whether or not a particular game is worth wasting quarters on. Nevertheless, it's still a great concept that I'm sure keeps the gaming crowd very happy.

Recommended!"}
{"text":"just what i was looking for, relaxed arcade bar with cool music, i can call it my favorite place in the valley."}
{"text":"This place is definitely unique. Being from Vegas, I can appreciate the \"hole-in-the-wall\" vibe and all of the pinball options and 80's arcade games. Employees were super nice and they have a small kitchen too in case you get hungry."}
{"text":"Very young bar as for as the patrons go. Seems to be primarily the hipster crowd, and seemingly all of them smoke, thus leaving butts everywhere on the ground outside. Not in the best of neighborhoods, so car break-ins seem to happen more often in this parking lot than others nearly"}
{"text":"The Grid has a unique and fun look to it. Most of the games are free and they have just about every system available. They have a great variety of beer. The service was good, everyone was very friendly and accommodating, though I felt that the bartender could have checked in on us a bit more. The reason for the average review was I was incredibly dissatisfied with the food. We ordered the cheesy buffalo tots, it came out room temperature, the cheese not even melted on top. Then I ordered the Patty Mayonnaise. When I took a bite my mouth was coated in what felt like straight oil, leaving a gross and very greasy feeling in my mouth well after I finished my meal. As soon as we finished our food we tabbed out because we felt tired and somewhat sick, going straight to bed after getting home. Overall, I would come back to enjoy a beer and some games but I would not order food from here again."}
{"text":"Great selection of beer, tasty food, and an amazing selection of console games. I only wish it was kept a little cooler inside and if they had an N64 then they would be solid. :)"}
{"text":"Cool concept,  eclectic live music venue with video games.  Now the bad... it stinks,  like really bad! Not sure if there was a sewage issue or what,  but eewww.  Also they were out of 3 beers and vodka.  I'll give it another shot in a couple months.  Hopefully once they're more established,  things will be better."}
{"text":"Really awesome place. Decent selection of arcade games, great selection of beer! Haven't had the food but have heard good things. Most importantly the staff and owners are really cool and trying to do big things and events for the community. Super stoked this place opened!"}
{"text":"I rarely post reviews, but this locally owned and operated establishment deserves a HUGE shout out!  I brought a group there last night and we all had such a great time that I had to share.

First off, fantastic selection of arcade games. You can find just about anything from seriously retro nostalgic games, like Asteroids to the most modern and awesome games.  They have, arcade, pinball and console games.  Plus if arcade games aren't your fancy, they have a nice selection of board games plus Foosball, giant neon Jenga and a billiards table.

The staff there is super welcoming, friendly and helpful.  I hadn't played console games in years and the owner helped several of us get going.

They also have over 20 beers on tap, and the jalapeño cheddar sticks are awesome.  This is an awesome place all around and definitely worth checking out!!"}
{"text":"Very fun place and a great selection of things to do. Board games, retro stuff, super smash bros, and arcade games ranging from obscure to modern.

I've been there a couple of times and the ambiance feels like you're in a Tron theme'd garage. The neon lights they strategically place around are super cool.

These guys are very good at events and usually their games are free when events happen (you just have to pay the entrance fee). 

A big problem I've noticed is that most of their arcade games are rotation-ally broken, the selection of cool games on the Rasberry Pi hookups are kind of lame and the food's kind of bleh.

A huge highlight these guys have is the game Killer Queen which took a while to break in to the competitive social circle (nerd clicks, right?) but is super fun to play. As long as it's unlimited rounds, my group and I got really addicted to it. 

So yea, even though it's in the middle of nowhere, it's a great little gem in mid-Mesa and if you're around that area, it's a great place to grab some drinks and play some smash."}
{"text":"Cool environment, broken machines. Most of the cabinets and even the consoles weren't working properly. Drink menu was pretty boring. The venue itself was pretty small. You can skip this arcade bar."}
{"text":"Finally! A great barcade in AZ!

Have only been to The Grid once, but was very impressed with the section of games and beers. The Grid is located in a standard shopping center(seems like everything is in AZ)and has clearly labeled signage. Parking is plentiful, opposed to other barcades I have been to(I'm looking at you Eighty-Two). 

The Grid has a unique gaming layout, with a lot of games I have never seen before. They have a black light pool table, Raspberry Pi's hooked up to at least 20 computers, electronic pinball machines, an area for new(er) games like brawl as well as your standard arcade games. It seems like the owners really wanted to maximize new gaming technology to help restore and bring as many retro game options to the player. 

The best part of this barcade though is not the games, but the booze. I believe the woman who helped my fiancee and I was one of the owners and she was amazing. She took so much time walking us through the brew list as well as explaining the concepts and ideas behind the business. She wanted to make sure we knew how to access all the games, as well as insisting on giving us tastings of the beers she recommended. I have mad respect for that. You could tell she really wanted us to have the best time possible that night at her establishment. The Grid partners with 8-bit brewery, which has solid beers that stick on brand with the theme of the bar. 

Overall, my fiancee and I are thrilled that a arcade style bar opened near his hometown. Now every time we visit we can look forward to spending time with family while playing rad retro games and drinking great beer!"}
{"text":"There's not too many places where I feel like I can have fun on my own without feeling some anxiety. This is my go to place when I feel like getting out but have nothing to do. It has been harder for me because I haven't actually lived in Arizona for the past 10 years and being here temporarily, I would say my social life here has changed.

The first time I came here was with someone I've been friends with for a long time and we have always bonded on music. We were surprised/pleased when we walked in and they were playing some music we knew and liked (industrial/ebm). It did eventually switch up but we still had fun. I've mostly had their mixed drinks which can be kind of inconsistent depending on the bartender. My favorites are Future Holotape, Miami Vice, and Treat Yoself.

I've also had the food here a few times and it was mostly good. The first time I had their tater tots, it was great, but never again after that. It was so incredibly salty and I'm not sure if it was a certain cook or what. However, I won't dock any stars for that. The workers are all really friendly and I love all the game options. It is true that some of it does not work as it should but I mostly find something that will entertain myself and my friends. I will miss this place when I head back to Seattle."}
{"text":"This place is pretty dope I come just for the old school arcade games but I got to say it's a way better place to go than the shitty wannabe barcade (bonus round) the grid has good music and cool environment"}
{"text":"Disclosure: this place serves vegan food and automatically gets a +2 review for being awesome in that way. To their credit they are a 4 place anywho so hurry up and check out out!

The place is cool. Hipster cool. Rekindled my love of foosball of all things. Very welcoming to children of the 80's, but those millennial hipsters are more than welcome too. Gen Y - go away. 

The main attraction for the evening was a game called Killer Queen that pits 5  vs 5  in a pretty cool action/strategy game that can really only last about 2m max. The down side is it was a tournament and or team was a$$ whipped since we have never played the game before. There were some seriously  at this event and we were bounced early. 

The rest of the place is an eclectic mix of console games, pool table, foosball, pinball, and crazy arcade games from all over the world."}
{"text":"So we were enjoying the little time me and my wife had to ourselves,  we seen the grid on Google and decided to try it since it's down the street from us. Started to enjoy the lighting and games, then in our second round of drinks,  my wife was drinking her drink and she felt 2 small objects in our mouth. One went down with the drink and the other she stopped with her tounge.  Pulled it out and it broken glass! Really!!! Thanks for ruining my wife's night, hopefully she's fine and can pass it. If not somebody's paying these bills! After that nonsense I do not recommend anybody to this place! It did not let me choose less than 1 star!!! Rated -5 stars!!!!!"}
{"text":"I checked out this bar on a Tuesday night which also happened to be trivia night. Drank a few delicious Moscow mules while playing some games. Next time I'll have to try some of the bar food to give you a rating. 

The bar itself has quite the selection of games, not all free. In one room I played super smash brothers, they have up to 8 players on that! They also had an xbox with halo 2 on it. And a classic Atari where I failed at Frogger repeatedly. The surprising amount of multi game consoles were nice. One of which was loaded with classic arcade games along the lines of Mario classic, pac man, and plenty more that unfortunately I was to buzzed to remember.

Feels like a bar where bringing a few friends would go over better than rolling in solo. I will be going back at some point and would suggest you give them a try if you are considering it."}
{"text":"This place is fun! I will return. They don't have as big of a collection as cobra DT, but there is less of a crowd making it easier to play the games you want. Majority of the games I played were free. I don't know if it was because it was Saturday and there was a $5 cover charge. 

I highly recommend this place for a fun night out."}
{"text":"Had my 47th bday here.  I really liked it.  The games were fun, brought back plenty of memories.  Good selection of beer, slightly spend, but they have to make money.  Standard bar food.  It was great because there is no other place in Mesa like it, I would go back for sure."}
{"text":"The Grid is the *perfect* environment for this socially awkward introvert. It's like an arcade, but with beer. They have board games, arcade games, retro and current gaming systems. Rock Band Mondays are fantastic. Check out Killer Queen, a super fun multi player game. They have tournament nights too. The Grid is the only bar I like going to. The owners and staff are A+ and go the extra mile to make you feel welcomed."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place so much! I am a big gamer and it's so great that I can go somewhere besides home and have some fun! The pizza is fantastic and everyone is very friendly. I can't think of one thing I would change about this place!"}
