{"text":"This place is amazing the best pizza. You must try it they make it fresh lots of flavor and its not oily... It is the best pizza that my family has eaten.  My kids, love it they actually eat the whole pizza instead of just eating the topping.  The philly cheesesteak it was amazing totally  way better than Jersey Mike if you want a good sandwitch try it here its so delicious and very reasonable for the price... It a place you must say!!!"}

{"text":"This place is the best .....the pizza is not oily and the crust is crunchy and tasty..Philly cheesesteak sandwich is the bomb..it's not your Normal pizza place go try it out..."}
{"text":"Simply put, Da' Crust Pizza Pizza & Kitchen over Lou Malnati's IMO. Their tomato flavor is robust, the crust is awesome, it's not oily, and their roasted garlic will make you want to check your breath afterwards. This is a pie to try especially for us locals who don't want to drive to the strip to eat at Giordano's. Awesome job!"}
