{"text":"I stopped by for lunch a few days ago. It was my first time here. They serve breakfast all day and I love me some breakfast so I was really happy to see that!  I ordered 2 eggs with rosemary potatoes, bacon, toast and fruit. The food was delicious!  The potatoes were, crispy on the outside and perfectly seasoned. The bacon was delicious as well, nice and crispy. The staff was really friendly also. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"First time I've been here - I'll rate it higher if subsequent dishes offer same quality. Clean, quick, nicely remodeled from the previous fish-fry establishment. Enjoyed burger and reasonably-priced, table-delivered lunch in a quiet spot. Sounds simple, but not easy to come-by in this neck of the woods. Check it out and say hi to Dona :)"}
{"text":"Definitely as good as it gets! I've worked in the area for 7 years so I was really excited to see a new, affordable venue in the area. Dona and her staff make you feel like you're part of their family the minute you walk in the door. The food is just as fabulous. You're able to call in your order and pick it up. I've had breakfast for lunch and their daily specials are awesome too."}
{"text":"The place is very much like home. Everything tasted fresh. The pancakes can be ordered with chocolate chips at no extra cost. The eggs and hash browns were amazing. Everything came with great proportions. I really enjoyed the food with my boyfriend. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast spot! Nice small home feel place with fresh and tasty food. I try to make it in at least once a month and am never disappointed"}
{"text":"We ordered Dona Delivers Catering for a girls' weekend dinner.  Dona was easy to work with, delivered on time and set up the food for us.  Presentation was great and everything tasted delicious!  We would all highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Cute lil nook of a place, clean and nice.
The food was just ok. One guest order eggs over hard, and both dishes came out over easy, even as the server asked, who had over hard.
Hash browns and toast not browned or warm enough.
No omelette options on the menu at all.
Went because of the reviews on the biscuits/gravy, but didn't have today, and not a regular menu item. Suggestion to add them.
Coffee refills slow and when it came time to pay, put the credit card away after awhile and paid cash so we could leave. 
Think there is potential here, but need to improve in some areas."}
{"text":"Awesome pumpkin pancakes!!  Great service and great to patronize a small business that has an involved and engaged owner!!!"}
{"text":"Two words: EAT HERE! It's too bad I live in Tempe, well actually it isn't, but thankfully I work in Scottsdale where I do most of my eating 5 days a week. This place is amazing. Whether you are by yourself or need catering done for the office, this is the go-to place in Scottsdale. 

For Breakfast, get the French Toast (French Bake). It will be the best version of this you have ever had in your life - just ridiculous. If you don't have a sweet tooth, get ANY of the breakfast crossaints, and yes, once again, the best Breakfast Crossaint you've ever had in your life. These are two personal favorites for me but there are other breakfast items. You will think you are on the Travel Channel eating the best food the pallate can experience.

Lunch is great also, got the cheeseburger and it was one of the most flavorful, tastiest burgers I've had. They mix up the lunch daily and it is affordable considering the fact that the location is in Scottsdale.

All this to say, please try them out starting for lunch today or breakfast tomorrow."}
{"text":"Been to Dona Kay multiple times. Loving it everytime. Great food, great people, great atmosphere. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent and Dona was great. We were in the area getting our car serviced, and decided to give this place a go. We got the French toast and 2 eggs with bacon and toast, and it was great! We'll definitely come back. Dona also does catering, which I'm sure is fantastic."}
{"text":"OMG....I just had the best Grill cheese sandwich at this little cafe! Sourdough with a grilled buttery taste, with a couple of different cheeses. The pepper jack cheese sticks in my mind the most I have never been offered an adult grill cheese with pepper jack! To die for and will make you want more!"}
{"text":"WOW....what a surprise!  I have passed this place numerous times and decided to give it a try. It is a \"no frills\" interior, but is very clean. The owner waits tables, looks over the food prep and welcomes the customers with a smile. Although the menu is limited, all ingredients are fresh and menu items are well prepared. My husband ordered the Denver omelette and said it was the best he has had. That's high praise because he is a real \"foodie\". I had poached eggs, bacon and sour dough toast. All were yummy!  We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a whim with my mom. The strip mall itself is under remodel, almost missed it. However, once inside it a charming little restaurant. Sausage and rosemary potatoes were freshly cooked and well seasoned. Nice, strong coffee. Fresh, cold fruit. Biscuit and gravy was super tasty. Only wish portion sizes were a little bigger. Overall, would definitely come here again and would recommend!"}
{"text":"Maybe not the greatest place for breakfast. It was ok.

Coffee was weak and not very hot. The water brought to the table tasted very much like bleach.

The owner came to the table to chat and be friendly...a little too much.

The food itself was pretty good overall and the jam for toast was spectacular!

With all that said, for a great breakfast experience I would probably look elsewhere."}
{"text":"So I came in for lunch because a friend told me that they had amazing food and I'm glad they did the food was awesome and Dona was great I have no complaints will be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Perfect sized portions, relaxing atmosphere, friendly service. My favorite eatery yet on this vacation! We will definitely visit again. If you get a chance try the cranberry lemon pancakes-heavenly!!"}
{"text":"The Husband and I were looking for a quick bite while having our car washed and happened upon this little \"Mom & Pop\" style place across the street. Dona was extremely nice and friendly, the food was delicious and they have some beautiful local pictures on the wall. 

I ordered Rene's Breakfast (\"2 eggs how you like 'em served with your choice of 2 sausage links or 2 strips of bacon, seasonal fruit and one buttermilk pancake\") and my husband tried the mysterious AZ Border Hopper (\"It doesn't matter what's in it.... it's worth the risk!!\"). Both were very fresh and very good! 

It's a small venue however they also do catering, which I am eager to try out. We will definitely be going back for some fresh, made to order food!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here during our travels to Sedona and found this place to be more than just a place for breakfast.  The hospitality was superb!  We were routing out how we were going to travel to Sedona and they gave us great advice!  Not only was the breakfast delicious but the suggested route was amazing!  Thank you all for a great visit!  This is a must stop place!
Thanks from your friends from Wisconsin!"}
{"text":"Dona Kay's has it all - welcoming, warm and friendly service and great food. Breakfast is delicious and we tried their wraps for lunch today. The wraps were fresh, tasty and nicely presented. Smoothie was excellent, too. We plan to become regulars. Took a catering menu with us, also."}
{"text":"I love Dona Kay and her food! I always go with the taco bar for my catering order. It's always a hit! I plan to use her on my wedding day soon too. Always friendly and on time. Her staff is great as well."}
{"text":"I go to the sushi place next door all the time and thought I'd stop in and try something, and that was a great decision! I got a peach and banana crepe and it was amazing, and the service was great! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Been here for breakfast and lunch. Love the food and the entire look of the cafe. It is newly opened and the detail inside is so comfortable and cozy. Food is great and people are nice."}
{"text":"We contracted with Dona for an event we held at our home and could not have been more pleased with her services.  From the very beginning, Dona's expertise in catering was apparent - she came to the house to help us to decide whether to hold the event at our home versus a community center and put my mind at ease that our home offered an ideal setting that could easily accommodate the function.  On the day of the event, within moments of arriving, Dona and her husband Marc pulled together the outdoor area to look remarkably professional and festive. They arranged the serving areas perfectly and the food items were excellent - simply ideal for the occasion.  Upon leaving, the kitchen didn't look as if anyone had been there!  I no longer have any reluctance to host a party in my home knowing Dona would provide full oversight."}
{"text":"They catered a meal for our company and I wouldn't mind giving this place a try at the actual location.  Catering is always a toss up since the food isn't fresh serve and you have to hope it holds up to travel and burners instead of a griddle and a short walk to your table for the server.

The eggs were a touch bland, but not bad by any means.  The potatoes were cold, but again - catered, not fresh served so fingers crossed they are toasty on-site.  The best part was actually the fresh fruit they served!  It tasted like they got it from the farmers market the morning of - delish.

Will definitely have to go and give them a whirl and hope that they are even better in a seat on-site!

Overall rating: B+"}
{"text":"We just had the best Saturday morning breakfast prepared by Donna.  Our expectations were exceeded from beginning to end.  Food was wonderful and the service was amazing.  We even received a text later in the day asking how our experience was.  What a great start to our Saturday.  Curt Henderson"}
{"text":"I was able to call in my breakfast order to go at this place great idea really close to work for me. Perfect a quick pick for me for breakfast.  I was looking for a breakfast sandwich but the owner did not have croissants or English muffins but she offered me a burrito and I loaded it with veggies, cheese and salsa.  It was good the eggs where cooked just right and it was not greasy at all.  I think she also mentioned a sourdough breakfast sandwich that sounds good I will have to try it next time.  I also got a coffee, this also tasted really good. It had flavor and tasted fresh. I have had lunch here as well before today, a, Caesar salad, nothing special but it was good, the salad was fresh and dressing was not to tangy. So far I like this place, very clean and very friendly. I really like there hiking theme as well."}
{"text":"I have seen this location change hands several times over the past 3 years, from a Lebanese restaurant to a fish and chips restaurant, and now Dona's. I think Dona's is a winner and hope it stays around longer then the last two. Dona's cafe is clean and extremely friendly. I had the chicken caesar wrap for lunch. It was very tasty, the chicken was just right  and the dressing on the wrap was very good but not overpowering like other caesars I have had. I will be back to Dona's again to try out the sirloin burger next.  

Now for the cons. The layout of this restaurant has always been a little odd, like eating in a long hallway, it feels a bit like a work lunchroom. Not much you can do about that, its just the way that space was built.
The other con was just that the lunch menu seemed lacking in comparison to the breakfast menu. The food was so tasty that I'd like to try other dishes' but after just a few visits I will be out of new choices."}
{"text":"It was just ok.  The place seemed really cluttered and the portions were really small for the price.  I have always wanted to check it out, but now I won't return."}
{"text":"Gotta give one more star. Best biscuits n gravy in Phoenix(Scottsdale) I lived in the South and prefer my own over the goop served in most breakfast places in the Valley. Not so at Dona's. Flaky biscuits, savory gravy, quality sausage. Throw in superb friendly service, and you got to give a top rating."}
{"text":"Really great food, wonderful people and a convenient location near the 101 freeway.  You got to give this restaurant A try."}
{"text":"The food is very generic. \"Breakfast served all day long\" but they're only open until 2pm. I mentioned my yelp check-in for a free coffee twice and they didn't take it off my bill. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Service ranges from atrocious to bad to just average, and at some point it's just not worth enduring and I give up.  Sure, I can cut some slack because it is a small locally owned business with family working there, but you have to draw the line somewhere.  

Menu options range from rather standard breakfast fare to a few less common items, but the prices seem far too steep for a place like this.  It might be Scottsdale, technically, but it's a run down strip mall and it's rather modest on the inside as well.  You're just not paying for atmosphere or nice location here, so the prices are a little unexpected.  Food portions aren't particularly large for the price, and for some of the simpler breakfast plates like a basic 2 egg breakfast you're looking at around $8... whereas normally those similar plates are more like $5 at other breakfast spots.  Food is fairly good but nothing spectacular.   With the service and value issues, I think one ought to give this one a pass."}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome first time here will not be our last.  Biscuits, Gravy and Omelette outstanding."}
