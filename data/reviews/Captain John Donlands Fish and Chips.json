{"text":"My family used to eat here a lot in the 90s and got a lot of large take away orders. It was delicious back then. It has changed ownership hands quite a few times since. My husband and I decided to try it a few weeks ago and was less than impressed. We got their family deal as a take away order and I really wish we'd just gotten a small meal each to try instead of wasting the money. For some reason our fries were salted. And not just slightly either. If they weren't salted, they would've been the best part of the meal. The most off putting part was the fish. We got like 8 pieces and they were all uniformly cut into thin, perfect little squares. I don't know about you, but I know of no fish that are square. It was supposed to be halibut, but in all honesty, it could've been anything from the lack of flavor. The only reason it gets 2 stars, is for their friendliness and the generous amount of Wing's tartar sauce that helped my fish taste like something."}
{"text":"Wanted to try a new fish and chip spot so headed to Captain John Donlands Fish and Chips. We ordered 2 PC's of halibut with chips and Calamari. The fish was good, the fries were great (with gravy) and the calmari was ok. Overall it was a good meal and hit the spot. Customer service was also great!"}
{"text":"The decor may not be great, but the fish n chips make up for it. The owners are very friendly. Best local spot for fish n chips hands down."}
{"text":"A real hidden gem! After a brisk walk with our dog we stopped by the streets nearvy to grab some grub. The fish and chips here were not only delicious, but really fresh. Definately reconmend you to try it out.  We got a seafood platter and got a piece of cod and haddock on the side.  The cod was extremly tender and flaky I didnt even to cut the fish, the halibut was extreme meaty and made me question if I was truely eating fish, but my favorite fish was the haddock. The haddock was flaky like the cod, but also a little meaty just like the halibut.  My favorite however was the scallops. Not only were they fresh out of the fryer but when i bit into the scallop, the freshness and sweetness engulfed my mouth.   All in all, although all the fish were great, my favorite were the scallops and halibut, definite a  must try."}
{"text":"This place has gone under new management which isn't necessary a good thing. The decor has still stayed the same but it is starting to show its age.  Came on a Good Friday and got two orders of halibut and chips with a side of coleslaw. The wait wasn't long but the tables were not clean and sticky. The fish did not have enough batter and did not come with any lemon. The fries were good but the tartar sauce was too creamy and the coleslaw was decent. The portion size was just right for the price (under $12 for each meal).  Overall, the quality was a lot better under the old management but the price is still decent."}
{"text":"Good Halibut cooked well and attention to detail is excellent. I go when i am in the area. The fries are also good. I know FISH. Go to see them."}
{"text":"Fries are really good. Customer service is always good as well, friendly.  I had the fish and chips and the fish was a bit too oily for me, it's fried food though so I don't really complain.  I'll go back for sure!  Too bad the prices changed..."}
{"text":"Was looking for a decent British type chippy and was not disappointed at all!  Three of us had the haddock and chips on a Saturday night in.  The portions were a great size, the fish was very fresh and the batter just melted in your mouth, the fries were just as great.  The owners of the restaurant were incredibly friendly, and it will definitely be my regular spot now for fish and chips!  Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"This is our local fish & chip joint. Eat in if you want but we always get take out. I'm not a fish eater but I do love their chips, a small order will fill you up. My wife, who is a fish eater, likes the fish, not too oily or greasy or whatever. The owners have changed a couple of times over the years, but the quality hasn't dropped."}
{"text":"It was my first here.Fries where cook long enough.  I had fish it wasnt nothing special.  Am knot sure  if am going back there again.  I wasn't really impressed"}
{"text":"Pretty good fish and chips. Ordered haddock, fries and calamari. Everything is from frozen but it is still pretty good. Went for dinner and the oil was still fresh - no nasty dark batter. Price is average. I will say it was better than what Is supposedly fresh at a Tobermory joint."}
{"text":"The halibut and chips are delicious, the fish was so sweet and firm and the chips are handmade! It's a family business and they're super friendly. Definitely a hole in the wall kind of place that people should try when they're in the area!"}
{"text":"Been going by this place for years and never thought to stop in. Thanks to fellow yelpers & their reviews i figured I'd check it out.  Probably the best surprise I've ever had. The Haddock is moist encased in the crispiest paper thin batter. Just melts in your mouth. Chips where just enough & the price was right, for 2 of us with 2 pops the bill came in at $22. Normally the bill for one person comes in around that at any other Fish & Chip shop.  Not hard to see why, After Chatting with Captain John you can see that he loves people and loves what he does.   Definitely worth checking out"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years, but with that being said once every 2 years on average. I only get the fries so can't comment on the other food.  Overall the fries are great!!! 4.5 stars on those! Service: kind of crappy! Lady looked at me like I cant afford her food.  She also gives one pack of ketchup and no napkins. Upon asking for more she started shaking her hand. I offered to pay for additional napkins she walked away. Now I don't like her service but the fries are damn good.  Not sure if I will go back."}
