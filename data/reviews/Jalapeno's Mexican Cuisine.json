{"text":"Every time I get a craving for the cilantro soup, it happens on a Friday or Saturday night. Eating dinner in a relatively small room with some Mariachi band members poking guitars in your face gets a little annoying. So, I haven't been in years. Going back to that cilantro soup- to die for! The salsa is probably home made and spicy enough for me to feel it. The vegetarian options are limited and last time I was there included the Chile Rellenos on the \"healthy\" section of the menu. Battered, fried, and filled with cheese- Delicious? Yes.  Healthy? NO."}
{"text":"The wife and I got on a bus and left our hotel's area, because we found an advertisement for Jalapeno's in our Toronto guide. Usually we like to just walk and find a hole in the wall, but we were hungry and needed food asap.

Upon arriving to Jalapeno's, we were not overly impressed by the exterior, but I am also someone who believes that you should not judge a restaurant by its cover.

We entered to a loud live band performing. The band was in fact the owners kids. That is definitely a first for me, I do not think I ever walked into a restaurant to see the family performing.

We were seated, and by seated I mean squished in between two other tables. While I do not like when restaurants do this, I understand they must fit in as many tables as possible to make money.

We were seated close to the bar area, and unfortunately had to hear the blender blaring over our conversation. Anyways the food comes out and we fell in love with the place. Tasty and plenty to go around. 

I had the tortilla soup, which was tasty...followed by Pollo en Mole Verde, which is grilled chicken breast with green mole made of pumpkin seeds. It came with a side of rice, fried beans and handmade corn tortillas.

I washed all this spicy tastiness with a few XX Ambers. So the food gets the 3 stars...but I took off 2 stars for the cramped setting, where everyone can hear your conversation and the loud blender blaring from the bar. But if you want good Mex in Canada, definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"If your only introduction to Mexican food involves you standing in a food court or completely legless on a Saturday night leaning against the wall of a Taco Bell, then you definitely owe it to yourself to try the real stuff.  As fine and life-saving as I'm sure the fast-food variety of tacos and the like can be, it's no match for the real stuff.  Not being able to afford regular flights to the southern portion of North America, this will have to do.

Tucked away on King Street West, it has a very unassuming storefront.  Once inside, the d√©cor is Mexican but not to the point of having sombreros on top of mounted deer heads or the like.  The marguerites are tasty and recommended and the food is probably about as close as you can get to authentic as you can get up here I'm guessing.  In Toronto, you run that risk of thinking a place is dishing up the real deal only to find out from friends of yours with the same ethnic background that the place is authentic as the RibFest entry for the McRib.  I get the feeling from those I've talked to that this is pretty close."}
{"text":"I can't say a whole lot about this restaurant. Despite the fact that it is conveniently close to my house, I've only eaten there once and that food experience wasn't a great one. 

I had tacos with pork slices along with a very vinegary salsa salad. These slices were tough, making it difficult to chew. I didn't enjoy it and I haven't been back there since. But now I don't think I can, ever: it's closed. 

Closed for some time, I began to suspect the resto ended its run when all of the patio furniture disappeared after Labour Day. I became even more suspicious when I peaked through the front door window to see the entire content of the bar was gone. 

Since then white paper has covered up the windows but just today when passing by, I saw a pick-up truck with beat-up refrigerators and stoves in the back. With no sign that said \"Closed for Renovations\", I think it's safe to say that Jalapeno's is no more.

Whether it becomes a new and improved restaurant or it will be reborn into something else, I'll be on the lookout."}
{"text":"This a wonderful Mexican restaurant, where the motto is \"no tex-mex\".  In keeping with that sentiment, the food seems very authentic. I'd recommend getting the guacamole as a starter; it's incredibly fresh and tasty. The enchiladas are a real surprise too. 

A small room, with big taste."}
{"text":"Authentic, delicious Mexican food. I had tried to come to Jalapeno's several times before -- they are closed on Sundays and don't open until 6pm every night, so that kind of worked against me for a while.

When we got there, I noticed the place was kind of dingy inside, but the whole family was on staff and they were so so so nice that I totally forgot about the interior. They offered us food suggestions, and brought a free appetizer of delicious tortilla chips and two kinds of salsa, as well as pico de gallo, and I got more salsa brought over when I said I could take a bit of extra spice.

The food is delicious here, but the menu is a bit on the pricey side. I'm more than willing to pay $18 for a good meal, but I really wasn't expecting to pay that much on this night. The prices meant I scoured the menu until I found something that was on the cheaper side and was going to fill me up.

That said, the food is so good it doesn't make sense. I inhaled some Tacos Al Pastor and Tortilla soup, and my boyfriend's Mole Poblano was really good, but was a new taste for us, since we've never actually had Mole before.

On the way out, I grabbed a takeout menu since I saw a bunch of people picking up food during our meal. That's when I realized that the prices are SUBSTANTIALLY cheaper when you get takeout. So next time, I'll get takeout, order twice as much food, and be twice as happy (and fat). I'd recommend doing the sit-down experience once, just so you can see how nice everyone is. Then, take out. Mmmm tacos."}
