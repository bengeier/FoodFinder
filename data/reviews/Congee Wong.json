{"text":"Came with my 8 friends last Thurday morning. We order 7 breakfast and side order 1 hot drink and 1 cold drink. For my order was 2 eggs (well done), ham with toast (but I request no toast and no butter). But they gave me 2 sunny side up, ham with bread with butter. They brought back my dish to kitchen and fixed for me. But its too oily and cold on the ham and bread with butter (because 2nd time they gave me 2 eggs (over easy, so brought back to kitchen 3rd time). Cold milk tea very bad and make my tummy whole day uncomfortable. For my friends, they said noodle in soup very bad. When we got the bill, they charge more side order drinks, so we told them to fix it ( charge more $3). But the chasier and waitress told us .... \"only charge us more $1 only jar .........\""}
{"text":"This location is the worst one of the chain. The servers here are rude and unattentive.   They are never patient to take your orders and typically rushes to leave everytime they put dishes down at every table (even during non rush hours)."}
{"text":"Poor service, waited in line, had been skipped because the guy wrote the wrong number and received no apology; 

poor food quality, very salty, the beef and turnip casserole has mostly turnip and very few pieces of beef; 

Pre-charged service fee?? Do they know they have poor service and are afraid people will not tip?"}
{"text":"-probably the busiest Congee Wong of all franchise

-Spice & Pepper Pork Chop ($8.75) had even amount of the spice comprised of salt, sweet peppers and chili.  The subtle spiciness was exquisite.

-Beef & Veggie Rice Noodle ($8.25) leaned towards the dry end of the spectrum.  But there was enough sauce to moisturize the noodles and give it flavour.  Not overdone~

-Yeung Chow Fried Rice ($8.50) is an example of fried rice success.  Not much oil was used.  Each piece of rice was coated with egg.

-Beef Mushroom Hot Plate (11.95) was sizzling hot when served.  The fumes and aroma evaporating into the air made our mouths water.  Scallions and Onions were used for flavour enrichment.

-Vegetables with Mixed Mushroom ($9.25) was very fresh.  It was a good balance to all the protein and carbohydrates ordered.

Verdict: Fast meal, big portions, good price and tastes awesome.  If my parents drive 30 minutes from home to eat at Congee Wong @ North York, this really is how good the food is.  It is a restaurant that we specially make a trip for."}
{"text":"You can't get better food for such a good price! I love their congee here, it is absolutely delicious even when plain(conpoy). The satay beef is enormous for under $10 and could probably feed 3 people. The fried turnip cake is really good here but nothing beats their golden pudding dessert, delicious creamy goodness! This is my favourite place when it comes to fast food chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"I believe this location has gone downhill since the last time I've been here. This restaurant used to be jam-packed with customers day and night but when I went to Congee Wong on a Saturday Night for dinner, to my surprise only 5 tables were taken up by customers! What happened?! From experience, I think it's partly due to competition with other Congee Restaurants (I personally think Congee Queen is best) and their food quality. Yeah the food here is good for the price and it's the cheapest you can find for the huge dishes you receive but the quality had really plummeted. I had gotten a bad stomach ache the last time I ate here and it definitely was not a good feeling. I'm positive it came from the oily, MSG'ed fried turnip patties I ordered.... but on the other hand, the congee was still goood and tasted great together with their fresh chinese doughnut."}
{"text":"After a year or so, I decided to give another shot of this joint, since I'm around.
No surprise!
Same cheap ownership, same under-staffed.
Watching the poor servers running like crazy chicks is not helping the appetite.
I guess the clientele here only concerns more on cheap food rather than anything else. That's why this place still exists.
So long, congee w!"}
{"text":"I think the perfect words to describe Congee Wong are \"average but reliable\".

You typically think of Congee Wong when you want a quick and fuss free dinner. You know exactly what you want before you even sit down because their menu never really changes. 

I've been here a few times and haven't had a bad experience so far. The servers are friendly for the most part and you get your food in less than 10 minutes. The food is not bad and portions are very generous so we always have leftovers to take home!"}
{"text":"Delicious congee at a fantastic price.  There are so many choices, it's unreal - the noodles dishes and standard chinese food also were quite good.  Don't forget the you tiao (dough fritters) to go with your congee! Multiple locations in the northern Toronto area, this location is inside the entrance for T&T supermarket (we had a hard time finding it at first since we're out-of-towners)."}
{"text":"Been to this place countless time because it's reliable and often a default option for chinese in North York.  I seemed to settle into some go-to choices on the menu but some stand outs include the salt and pepper squid, cantonese chow mein and the shredded pork & preserved duck egg congee.

Most of the tables seat 8 plus 1 or 2 kids so it's ideal for groups & families. The booths can seat 4 comfortably and maybe 5 depending on how skinny you are. I don't think they allow anyone sitting at the end in the middle of the aisle though.

This place gets really packed on the weekends and some week nights so make sure you go up to the hostess and grab a number quick."}
{"text":"I visited this place quite a few times and the food are normally pretty solid but service are normally below average and they seems to be under stuff all the time. I always feel bad for the servers. They always like chicken run around without head."}
{"text":"I went there last night. Service was good but wasn't impressed by the food. All the food we ordered from their specials menu was great, the regular fried noodles and rice. I also ordered a crab and fish maw soup which was so bad that no one at the table would have any and I ordered a large bowl :(
It tasted like they were running out of soup and decided to reheat it and fill it up with water and egg white. No taste in the soup and a big chunk of egg white at the bottom ($13). The \" ho nam \" chicken in hot pot, 25 mins wait and the rice was mushy . The staff that was there for yrs are all gone and they must have changed cooks as well. This place used to have line ups every night. They were about half full. We spent $95 and only half the food was edible"}
{"text":"Great place for huge portions of inexpensive, greasy chinese food.  Our go-to place for take out or a quick inexpensive dinner out.  Fried chili turnip patties are a must have."}
{"text":"the quality of the food seemed to have went down ever since a few years ago. definitely do not try their oyster crepe thing. it tasted like an omelette at 8$ after tax. their congee ingredient seemed to have changed and have more imitation crabs instead of others. the shrimp does not seemed to be cleaned. however their turnip cake are awesome as usual and their congee base is good (prob from MSG)"}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE POSSIBLE 
I would give negatives if I can, that was how bad the service was here. When I walked in I waited 10 minutes to just get a seat when it wasn't even busy. The servers all saw me but didn't even bother to come to seat us. When I finally got annoyed I asked a young male server for a table of two. And he was about to seat us right in front of the door when there were plenty of seats inside! Regardless we still seated and when it came time to order we couldn't find anyone to take the order. This was by far the worst service I ever gotten at any Chinese restaurant. DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION!!!! AT ALL COST!!!!"}
{"text":"Service was VERY GOOD - probably because it is still new! 

Food is your typical Chinese food - not bad at all, quality is better than average.  We will come back."}
{"text":"We use to eat at this location a lot till the food was quality was downgraded, no one answers when you call for take out and the orders are always taken incorrectly.  2 incidents when they delivered the wrong order and expected us to eat it or pay extra for it.  The drink orders for breakfast are \"always\" wrong."}
{"text":"I like their multi-grain bamboo fungus congee, which is only not served in other Congee Wong store."}
{"text":"I saw a cockroach on the wall at my table I called a waitress to come and look. She graped the cockroach and stepped on it in front of me and told me to move to another table. Hahaha. Nothing I can say. I was thinking about inside the kitchen. Shrimp wasn't fresh neither smell bad. Dont go back there no more. Good luck everyone. But food is cheap there but the workers has no manner."}
{"text":"good food, good prices, and there's free parking! can't go wrong, 4 people can eat for $40-50 and you'll need a doggie bag - woof!"}
{"text":"FOUND A PIECE OF ROCK IN THE MIDDLE OF EATING MY RICE. I felt something hard and took it out my mouth and this came out. Super disgusting and dirty. The food was also so bland. Dont get the vegetable fried rice it literally taste like white rice with salt. And added barely any vegetables, it was like the ones from the frozen variety pack for 1$"}
{"text":"I came in with my wife. The restaurant was maybe 25% full? They asked us to wait. 5mins later i asked to be seated as they clearly had plenty of empty tables ready. But the male waiter looked at me and walked away. Im not sure why, and nobody came back. The other wait staff were standing around doing nothing. This is unacceptable in my books and they should be getting 0stars. 

Don't make customers wait if your tables are ready and empty and your staff are doing nothing."}
{"text":"Not a great place for bringing kids to. That woman waiter says a lot of things like kids will break our utensils 99% of the time. It's no wonder their place is empty at lunch time during the weekend."}
{"text":"Order quick and they'll serve you quick. If you haven't made up your mind when they come to take your order the first time, it'll be a nightmare to wave them down to order again. Food quality is meh."}
{"text":"Pretty good Chinese food that's super fast. I would recommend the Szechuan chicken and any of the fried rices, they're all good"}
{"text":"I've been dining at this location for over 15 years, theres a reason why its still around and still busy -- especially weekends.  I've tried other congee wong locations and frankly this is still the best, other locations the food presentation might look the same - but the taste isn't there.

Frankly to me this is the original and the best 'for me'.  You get amazing value in price for the dishes you get, and they don't skimp on flavor.   Yes, there are tons of other restaurants like Congee Queen -- and though the food is good, its decor and pricing are for a more mainstream Canadian customer.

The service here is impeccable compared with any other Chinese restuarant, so even though its busy you will get seated pretty soon. (Though be warned weekends at FMP are always packed, and the wait might be longer)

I usually go with a few friends we order a main dish, rice or noodle -- which is a family sized dish to share and then order a few different plates of side dishes.  My friends who frequent here are Asian and white, and they all think its great.

This is one of the few handful of places that I still eat congee at, the congee here is simply put tasty whereas other restaurants are a soupy mess or something resembling breakfast oats.   

WHEN GOING HERE, DO NOT EXPECT the most amazing Chinese food ever.... but it is consistent, tasty, great value for money and impeccable service.  Oh and the place is more of a comfy decor than a modern up to date restaurant, don't judge a book by its cover..... remember I've going here for 15 years on and off regularly.

EDIT: 07/18/2014 ...This awesome place is now a Chef Wongs ...and things have changed....see Chef Wong review.   RIP Congee Wong FMP, you were good while you lasted."}
{"text":"I've come here a few times, but every visit was okay at best. 

The food came in big portions and prices were alright. I had a variety of congee, fried rice, noodles and some side dishes, but some were either very greasy or plain. The staff was rude and looked unwilling to serve. 

Sadly, that sums up every visit and I wish that wasn't the case, because the location is great, right next to T&T inside a mall, and the wait time is not long. I would recommended this place if you're looking for convenient, quick but average food."}
{"text":"Love this place!  It's alot of food for a great price!  When we first moved here, we went here weekly.  Always a line up, but there's a reason for that!"}
{"text":"Took my family who came to visit from China there. They all agreed it was very good and the taste was very authentic and Hong Kong like!"}
{"text":"I've eaten a lot of meals here, and brought a lot of friends. Food is great. My preferred meal: fresh shrimp congee, deep fried dough fritters, salt and pepper spice pork chop, and Chinese broccoli in garlic sauce; sometimes add in a beef chow mein. Even though I've moved to Mississauga now, I'll still make the occasional trip a few times a year to dine her with friends or family."}
{"text":"Their House Seafood is to die for and their food is always fresh and the best quality. The quantity is large as well. This is one of my favourite spots to dine in Toronto."}

{"text":"Their food is good, but their congee and fried noodles are my favourite. I've been here countless times. Service is okay, but could be a lot better."}
{"text":"Ok, I've been trying to call this place to order takeout food as I've done a ton of times before as they deliver.  So last couple of times the phone line was either busy or it kept on ringing until it hangs up.  Anyhow..I thought they were busy on the phone so decided to drop by to pick up food the other day.  

Anyhow...I find out the place is closed for renovations.  What horrible customer service...at least they could have had a voicemail indicating that they are renovating until further notice...anyhow...not so pleased..."}
{"text":"Affordable fast and delicious. Highly recommend! I have come here, congee queen, and other ajmipar establishments. I think this is he best restaurant (food, taste) in comparison!!"}
{"text":"staff and even the manager have very poor and rude communication ability.  After served with wrong dish, my request was just simply ignored.  all they are saying, \"we did not hear you ordering that\"  did not want any conflict, continue eating and finished meal.  pay the meal in full but no tips this time.  the manager asked if tips were left on the table.  said \"no\", then she looked and saying \"WHY?\" with such a forceful and negative voice.  simply replied,  food was not served right.  then she made a very rude hand gestures  \"get out\".   asked her, don`t you wanna know what had happen?  she said, she does not CARE!!!  wonder what type of business do this kind of service?  very low and almost ashamed to have that business in Richmond Hill.  everyone, please stay away~"}
{"text":"My friends' go-to place for congee. Price is cheap and most of their food is pretty good. It gets pretty busy even late at night, but the food comes pretty fast."}
{"text":"Horrible services.  Rude attitude towards paying customer.  To be honest their food are like any other congee places around.  Are they the best?  Meh~     for their services I WILL not come back.  I don't need to be treated with such a bad attitude.   Almost felt like I am begging for food from them.  For crying out loud I am a paying customer!  Need not to be treated with rudeness."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night. Bad service. Cashier was rude. Food is ok. Wouldn't go here again."}
{"text":"I go to Congee Wong all the time. This has been my favourite Congee Wong location for the past 6 years. Out of all the Congee Wong's, this one has the best fried turnip rolls and salt and pepper squid. This location also has the biggest portions. However, this location is probably the smallest so expect to wait for a table during busy hours at dinner time. The parking is not that great in this plaza too during busy times. Service is always quick and typical Chinese service. I'm a little disappointed that they have discontinued my favourite style of Congee \"Chiu Chow Congee with abalone and chicken\""}
{"text":"Pretty decent Hong Kong style restaurant.  It's always our staple quick late-night dinner place.  It's fairly cheap, with good food, open late."}
{"text":"Whenever I visit the Toronto area, I try to stop by this place for some wholesome goodness.  The congee is fantastic.  It's balanced flavor - not too strong or weak - and just the right amount of ingredients.  For example, I just had the congee with pork and preserved egg.  It wasn't too much or too little in terms of pork or preserved egg.  The only complaint was that one of the eggs wasn't cut through all the way.

Outside of congee, the rest of the menu is also well done.  We ordered lobster with ginger and scallions on top of pan fried noodles.  The lobster was cooked just right.  Not overcooked nor undercooked.  Combined with the sauce on top of the crispy noodles, it was great.

I've eaten here probably a total of 3-5 times over the past 5 years, and I've never had a bad meal.  They've been consistent.  They get really busy during lunch time on a work day.  So be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"My first time in toronto, so i asked around where i could get some good congee.   At least 4 of my friends recommended i visit congee wong if i ever make it up to north york.  Fortunately, my relatives live up that way, so we were able to stop there for breakfast before my flight back to the states.

Anyway, i'm a sucker for HK style breakfast, and this place hit the spot.  The ambiance was clean, the lighting was bright, and the menu was large.   Me and my aunt went nuts and ordered pork congee, ja leung, pork chow mein, gai lan, and salt/pepper pork chop.   Little did i realize the portions were generous and the prices were inexpensive!   The food was fresh but more importantly the congee was made perfectly.   Like any HK style restaurant, the food came quickly and it got busy fast.  I thoroughly enjoyed my last meal in toronto, and we brought tons of leftovers home.

Next time i'm in toronto, i'm going there again!"}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times because it is close to where I live. The food taste just okay. My bf, however, seem to love the food here (particularly the Tofu and Garoupa which he gets every single time =.=) I think this is just due to personal taste. I usually like more flavorful food, but cantonese cuisine is just milder compared to cuisines in other regions of China. However, I do appreciate that their food is not too oily or salty!
-other pros: LARGE portions, large variety of congee and noodles, friendly staff
-con: can become very crowded :(

side dishes I've tried and liked: tofu and garoupa, house special chicken, mushroom and beef, tofu and mixed veggie

congees I've tried and liked: mixed vegetable and sweetcorn, sweetcorn and beancurd.

congees I've tried and disliked: sliced fish congee tastes bland...."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this branch of Congee Wong considering the other branches were decent. Not only was the flavouring bland for all dishes the soup I ordered tasted like water mixed with canned corn and a few pieces of chicken. The snow peas were decent but still on the bland side. (2 stars for actually being edible) 

The service at this branch is atrocious.. I ordered ice water from a server and waited 20 mins for nothing? I asked the same waiter for the ice water once again and yet again she never brought it after 10 mins of waiting. At this point I was pissed out my mind. I looked for the server and told her if I was going to get my water. Another server finally brought my water just when we were paying for the bill..  

Plates are an essential when eating at a restaurant. Well, at least Congee Wong. But our plates didn't arrive until we were almost done our meal??  

Horrible customer service, BEWARE!"}
{"text":"Impolite service....not kids friendly restaurant....When we said we don't want plastic dish  for our son.....they will reply you that all kids in 99% will break the dishes....but they will still give you at the end.... .but you have to listen their impolite wording first..."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm out of the loop or maybe I assume too many things but I didn't know that Congee Wong owned Congee Queen until my most recent visit to CW. The main reason why I noticed that CW owned CQ were the signs and my subsequent website browsing onto CW's website.

Now, given the choice, I would go to Congee Queen any day of the night if I was given the option because their menu is more diverse but still offers the more traditional dishes but I've observed that CW is beginning to implement some of CQ's special menu items now like the Soft Shell Crab Fried Rice (which I thoroughly enjoy).

I won't go into decor/food/service this time around because I believe that most people should be familiar with this establishment by now but I'll make more specific subcategories.
  
Meal Structure & Sharing:
This isn't the restaurant to go to for a traditional 10-course meal but instead this is a restaurant to go to late at night or for a snack/casual meal. 

I don't mean to be a snob or anything but I do get a hearty chuckle when I see a group of people order rice or noodle dishes just for themselves partially because the plate looks ginormous in front of them and partially because I cannot fathom how they can finish it:P.  The portions are huge so I definitely encourage sharing so you can open up your palette..it's the Chinese way.

Busy Busy!:
This place is busy during prime time because of it's affordable menu and large portions.  That's why I suggest to go later at night or at odd hours if you don't want to bother waiting.  I'm not sure if you can make reservations at this place without people laughing at you?


MSG:
I don't go to CW that often but from what I recall last night as I was unable to sleep after a late night meal, I've come to the conclusion (because I'm like Sherlock and I put 2 and 2 together) that Congee Wong puts too much MSG in their food! 


Overall:
Bottom line is that this place serves it's purpose as a Chinese restaurant that has an affordable menu with good noodle/rice/congee dishes and sharing plates.  Go there for big portions at good prices.  If you're a light sleeper, maybe it's not such a good idea to go late at night unless you take sleeping pills:P"}
{"text":"We had a book club event here. I was the only Asian but my Cantonese is not great, so I got a lot of ribbing for that.

They were quite accommodating to non-Chinese speakers. I've had a lot of Chinese food in my life and this was pretty good. Nothing was bad. Nothing was amazing.

4.0 stars"}
{"text":"Amazing congee one of the few congee places I've been to that has my favorite combination of oysters, mushroom and chicken congee. Their chicken and shrimp fried rice is also very good and the prices here are very affordable. I go here almost all the time."}
{"text":"Cheap and plentiful. The menu is very large and contains a mix of items.  Service wasn't amazing but food came out pretty quickly. 

Ordered braised beef ramen, pork chop vermicelli, and the spicy and peppered squid. The squid was slightly dry and the noodles was alright. 

They have a $10 minimum for debit and $20 minimum for credit card."}
{"text":"Quick Chinese food served hot. Their noodles are pretty good and everything else is fairly average. Aside from that, there isn't anything really special about the place. Service is average at best and bad at worst. Overall, meh."}
{"text":"It is a good place for quick-and-go meals with many items in their menu. Roast ducks and BBQ pork are delicious and freshly made everyday. Big portion of main dishes with reasonable price. Comfy seating with young toddlers. Their take-out menu is good with varieties and meal combo (choose your own dishes combo). Their afternoon tea menu is very competitive with other Hong Kong style restaurants. 

In general, it is a great place for family gathering as seniors can order lighter items (congee, etc.), young family members can order Hong Kong style fast food (baked pasta, deep fried wings and stuff, etc.), and the rest of the family can order stir fried dishes or fried rice or noodles."}
{"text":"We seldom come to this location because food was usually not as tasty as other locations in the past; however, our recent visit surprised us entirely. Waiter service is better than before with the traffic they serve. Price is reasonable and taste is standardized with other locations. It is now a more family friendly place for quick-and-go meals. However, watch out for the peak traffic hours on weekends as big family groups making it a long wait at this locations."}
{"text":"Was good a number of years ago. The food tastes horrible now. Have it a few tries but don't think I will go back there"}
{"text":"I'm very particular about my congee, I don't normally eat it unless it is prepared just the way I like it and Congee Wong (and this is just a general indication for all their locations) seem to do a good job at making me eat my congee. I enjoy the fact that it's not overly thick or watery and still flavorful. At this particular location, I find the waiters and waitresses to lack smiles and friendly service. It might be due to the fact that they are often busy, seeing that they are located within / beside the T&T supermarket at the Promenade Mall, but whatever the reason may be it's just a quick order and go kind of thing. Food quality, I can't complain, they've made my dishes pretty satisfying for the many times that I visited. Pricing is inexpensive. But there is really nothing overly special about Congee Wong in comparison to many other typical Chinese eat-outs."}
{"text":"After a trip or feel tired, this is the type of restaurant that I will pick for congee, rice and noodle.  This Congee Wong location is one of its original. The quality is one of the best amongst all Congee Wong.

The congee is not just rice broiled in water.  The texture is like silky cotton mixed together.  This needs special treatment before boiling the congee.  The Beef Brisket Lo Mein is tender.  The sweet Cruller is one of my favorite.  The Minced Pork with Eggplant and Salted fish Braised Vermicelli is not salty and very tasty.

The quantity is huge.  The price is cheap.  The service is fast.  This surely should be marked as a family restaurant."}
{"text":"The food has been average or slightly above average at times from my personal experience. 

Compared to the T&T grocery next door which has a takeout area for hot foods its leaps and bounds better!  And yes it's worth paying twice as much for the same dish. It will at least taste like how it's supposed to. 

My only gripe has to be with the service. It's just plain rude.

I unfortunately find all the servers I've had rude and unwilling to serve. The looks, the mannerism is atrocious. They don't look happy at all. I can't stand eating here because of it and when I'm desperate and tempted I call a friend for consul to talk me out it."}
{"text":"Regularly come here when going out with the gf and her sisters. Pretty much lived up to its reputation. I found that this location is laid out exactly the same as the one in First Markham Place.

The food is good, Particular favorites include the mixed bean and fungi grain fungi for myself, while my gf prefers the fried turnip cake.

Most of the dishes are very well made versions of the standard chinese fare found in Markham."}
{"text":"Our group of ten came here for dinner, we ordered seven dishes and four bowls of white rice.  With tax and tip, we each paid only $10.25, which is unbeatable.

Out of the dishes we ordered, I liked:

- Crab meat fish maw soup (with real crab meat!)
- Tofu hot pot with grouper (the sauce, tofu and grouper were delicious)
- Snow pea leaves with King mushroom 

Other dishes we ordered:

- Salt and pepper squid (I've had better)
- Seafood congee (decent)
- Marinated beef  cubes with carmelized walnut (tender beef with delicious walnut)
- Dough Fritter rice noodle roll
- Cantonese chow mein

I used to like Congee Wong a lot, but perhaps they had an off day, the dishes were just ok on this particular occasion."}
{"text":"2.5 stars!
We ordered egg white fried rice with fish roe and seafood chow mein, I personally liked them both but not my in law; she said that they were bland and no \"wok hei\" but I found that they were not greasy and pretty good.  

Shredded chicken congee in super bowl: I personally don't like congee but my in law had 3 bowls along with deep fried dough fritter so it must be good.  

Service was good for a chinese fast food restaurant.  It was packed after 1pm on Sunday.   

One thing I didn't like about them and gave them 2.5 stars was the cleanliness of their bowls, chopsticks, cups and spoons.  We had 5 people in our party, and there were 2 dirty bowls (I don't care, even if the leftover food sticked outside the bowls, they were still DIRTY), 2 greasy cups (oil floating after we poured tea in), 1 dirty spoon and few sticky chopsticks YUCK!!!  The waiter had no problem to change them but I just didn't feel comfortable to use them without cleaning with my kids' wipes (thanks goodness I have toy/pacifier wipes with me, not the one for bum bum ;)    No wonder I found that some people brought their own bowls, cups and chopsticks to chinese restaurants these days, I wasn't kidding you!  I saw it few times in different location, may be they were the same family; i will pay more attention next time when I see them again.  But I think bringing your own wipes are more convenient, again not the one for your bum bum :)"}
{"text":"We literally came here right after we landed in Toronto, eager to try out this place because of all the good reviews.  We ordered the ginger, scallion lobster noodle and beef congee.  The congee tasted like they used a blender to blend the rice; or they had frozen the rice and then boiled it to save energy.  The taste was just not right. The lobster noodle was very starchy.   We were pretty disappointed and will not come back for our future visits."}
{"text":"Please hire more staff especially on weekends and peak hours. When we call to order take out, no one answers or someone answers and then hangs up on us.  I also experienced someone picking up the phone but she didn't say anything and continued to serve people at the restaurant.  When we ate at the restaurant, the orders are often mixed up, we were giving a dish that was slightly different than what we ordered (fried egg instead of sunny side up).  We thought the kitchen made a mistake and didn't want to waste food so we took it.  When the waitress realized she had given us the wrong dish, we were asked to pay for the wrong dish as well."}
{"text":"We were glad to see this place open up where Regal 16 used to be on 16th Avenue. The decor is great (typical Chinese restaurant), food is fantastic and service is very friendly. We love the embience here and we like that it opens late. 

The food is above-average from other comparable Chinese restaurants. There is a very large menu selection and surprisingly dishes come out very fast. We usually order more than we can eat so we can take the rest home to eat later. 

Unlike other Chinese restaurants, all the staff seem to be able to speak English; a plus for \"gwei lohs\" like us. In summary, a great place, great food at a very reasonable price. We will return for sure."}
{"text":"Loads better than Congee Queen, imo.  I used to eat here all the time when I lived in the area. Fast and friendly service, delicious food. Bright ambience, comfy seats.  I recommend the \"turnip cake\" (not really cake) and garlic shrimp fried rice."}
{"text":"I used to eat at Congee Wong frequently but one incident completely put me off and I have not returned. 

I found 2 inch long slivers of metal in my wonton ( like ones that might come off a metal scouring pad for cleaning dishes). I was shocked and almost cracked my teeth on it before spitting it out. I took it up with the waitress and manager. I even tried to be discreet so as not to embarass them in front of their other customers. 

The waitress looked dumbfounded and thee manager said very loudly, \"You found THAT in your wonton? How did that get in there!\" Then began to laugh hysterically. The waitress also started to laugh. I said, \"You're the manager, this is your restaurant. You tell me.\" She put up her arms and shrugged and walked away from me, still laughing. 

No apology, no explanation, no offer to at least replace the food or remove it from my bill. I paid, every cent and did not tip. I have never been back since and would not eat there again if it were the last restaurant left on earth. 

In a related note, if you search the health inspection website which oversees cleanliness in restaurants you will see that this Congee Wong has failed. many times, including once for failure to control rodents and having cross contamination of meat and vegetables. 

Rats in the kitchen and metal in my food. Never again."}
{"text":"After coming here 10-11 times I have decided to put up a review. This restaurant includes signature congee bowls, a large variety of noodle dishes, and various fried rice dishes. I would recommend their seafood congee along with their dough fritters which are VERY crunchy and tasty. I would also recommend their pan fried rice noodle with beef and soy sauce. Regardless of what you get here, you are sure to be satisfied!   
Happy yelping!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat.  The seafood congee and the beef and rice noodle dish are delicious- I could eat it all day. I've don't think I've ever had congee as good as this place. 

You have to get here early and eat like a grandpa if you want to be seated and not wait. Getting there around 6pm on Sunday was fine for my family of 6.

The service can be quite rude at times but also very fast, but that's just typical Chinese for you. The prices are dirt cheap, especially for me coming back from SF.  I can eat with my family of 6 for the price of two people in SF.  

I've read reviews of people suggesting that they use msg.  I think they probably do, but not so much that I feel sick.  

I would definitely count this as one of the best congee places in the city."}
{"text":"Once upon a time, there was a child who'd bravely endured a long, arduous journey up north to the magical land of Toronto. It was there that she'd feasted on hot, silken-smooth bowls of congee comforts. Since then, her Congee Wong breakfast had remained a reference point for cantonese fare. 
 
Been to Hong Kong/China multiple times since and still wasn't able to replicate the comfort eats that I had back at Congee Wong. When we returned on a roadtrip through Canada, we got duped by the \"Chef Wong\" but vowed the next day to visit the real thang. It was still as magical as I remembered, the pork + perserved egg congee was smooth and satisfying. What made it even more memorable was the plate of hot fried cruellers (??/you tiao). I cannot tell you how many times I get super disappointed when other places bring out cold, stale ones. The garlic sauteed snow pea tips arrived fresh from the wok. The ginger scallion lobster arrived hot and had a nice touch of sweetness. 

All-in-all a no frills experience, a perfect meal from beginning to end."}
{"text":"A family favorite. We love the seafood superbowl cogee with fried dough fritters, seafood chow mein, fried noodle with beef and bean sprouts, deep fried shrimp wontons, deep fried squid tentacles and yang chow fried rice. We get other stuff too sometimes but my family typically relies on my \"expertise\" haha"}
{"text":"As with other reviewers, it should be noted when you go to a Chinese establishment that you should not expect exceptional service. With that said, the staff definitely felt more disconnected than your average joe Chinese restaurant to a point that their job could very well be replaced by an iPad and conveyor belt. 

The food itself is quite standard and has huge proportions for the price. If you are looking to feed a large group on a budget without cooking at home, Congee Queen is definitely a viable option if you are in the Richmond Hill area."}
{"text":"Not quite as good as Congee queen, but still decent. If you are in a rush and can get a seat, this place is fast!"}
{"text":"Holy Moly this place is so BUSY! I've never actually been to another Congee Wong location that's this spacious and still has a huge lineup at the same time. 

The food is pretty much the same as other locations except that their radish cake is noticeably more soggy. This location stands out because they have BBQ meat available, ready to be chopped up and served to your table! We tried the mixed platter and the crispy skin pork is soo delicious! The duck meat on the other hand was too salty for my preferences..

The service here is a lot better than any other location I've been to. Servers here are very attentive and efficient given how busy they are. They've only been open for two months, hopefully they can keep their upbeat attitude consistent! 

I'll definitely be back when I'm in the area! Chinese fast food with good service? Come on, where do you find that these days?"}
{"text":"Congee Wong is my go-to Chinese restaurant when I happen to be shopping at T&T Supermarket next door. There's usually no wait time to get seated, and the food is served fairly quickly. The prices are mediocre and the same across all of their branches, and the food is pretty consistent - greasy, large quantities and loaded with MSG. 

I'm not too happy about the cleanliness - the washrooms are filthy, sometimes there's no toilet paper, the soap dispenser used to be a hot sauce bottle, the floor is greasy, there are flies circulating our food, and the tables aren't wiped clean. 

Nevertheless, I still frequent at Congee Wong because of how convenient/fast everything is. A Chinese McDonalds would be a comparable reference."}
{"text":"Definitely the best place we went to get congee in Toronto. My family visited relatives here and we went to two other Congee places until I resorted into looking on Yelp for the best reviewed congee restaurant. Too bad it doesn't seem that many canadians yelp, but this place seemed perfect for 5 ratings with 5 stars each. 

And yet...i join the ranks and add my 5 star rating as well. It is a very clean restaurant, nice and was crowded on a Saturday morning. We all tried different types of congee which come in a large bowl...too much for me to finish and we always get fried dough fritters everywhere we get congee, even at home. 

I got the Lai wan congee which is basically an everything type of bowl and it was great. Warm for a cold day and honestly perfect. Come here and basically you get all types of great varieties of food, but definitely congee is the best choice that warms you up. Definitely will come back here when we visit our relatives again : )"}
{"text":"Cheap eats, but that's it.  Thanks god we don't have to wait for the table.

We ordered pork liver, beef congee with thousand years eggs, and fried dough.
The congee ingredients was still raw and bloody.  The fried dough was chewed, despite freshly made.  Pork liver is just pork liver, still on raw side.

Not sure if I will be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Been coming here for as long as I can remember, and the food never disappoints. I think this is why I always come back. The consistency means that I never have to worry whether or not it'll taste bad, and I will always know what to expect from them. I've also been in during breakfast and lunch hours, and the food is just as amazing as the dinner service. Yes, sometimes when it is super busy the servers will not always treat every table with undivided attention, but really, for a Chinese restaurant, it's well above average. Congee Wong never disappoints me, definitely my go-to place when I need a quick fix of good Chinese food."}
{"text":"You know it is good when there is always a line up. I always end up there when I am hungry but have no specific craving because everything is tasty on the menu. You are bound to find something you like."}
{"text":"My 100th review, and there is no other restaurant more appropriate to review than Congee Wong.  
If I were on Foursquare, I'd forever hold the throne of mayorship here, if I had the Yelp mobile app I'd be the first and last person to check in here, and if I had a million dollars I'd buy this place in a heartbeat. 

There is not another human being on Earth who comes here as often as I do.  I've been eating here since the restaurant opened back in 2000, when I was shorter than the counter the cashiers sat behind, before this place installed their dozen cameras after being held up twice.  I was a customer here since I was 13 years old, it is the only reason why I have a weight problem and never had abs.  

At any busy evening there are 30 chefs in the kitchen woking up seriously delicious Southern Chinese cuisines, there is never a long wait for food, and the consistency of quality is perhaps the reason why this location has thrived since inception. 
The service here among the most efficient in any Chinese restaurant, and the staff are as professional as they come.  This location is where it all started for the other franchises.  Congee Queen, Kitchen 31 (formerly 'Sugar), and other Congee Wong locations all own their heritage to here.  

The food is authentic enough for the Chinese, and simple enough for Westerners.  The portions are generous whether dining in or takeaway, and there is delivery starting at 4pm until 11pm if you order over $25.  However, although it says free delivery, the driver will ask for a tip if you don't give him anything.  His reasoning is delivery is free, but he is not.  
Expect a 10 -15 minute wait if you come here on the weekend with no reservation, unless of course you are coming here with me, then you will find yourself seated immediately..cause I'm VIP yo.
Much of the food here will dehydrate you and leave you feeling like a prune, so be sure to drink plenty of tea.  
You can ask for your food to be altered in a few ways such as; no peanut oil, not as spicy, no MSG and etc. 

I think over the years I've put down as much as a down-payment on a house eating here.  I remember back in 2006-2007, I came here 3-4 times a week.  There are the rare occasions where I've dined here every day of the week.  During that time I've gone from 170 to 240lbs.  
I've also moved three times in the last 8 years, and I have failed to move away from the delivery zone for Congee Wong each time.  I am a slave to the chefs here.  I think one day I'm going to kidnap one of them for the recipes, I'm seriously considering it.  

Everybody has 'their restaurant', this is mine.  I've come here for over a decade now, and haven't even gone through a quarter of the menu.  I might just come here one day and order everything.  If I were a tacky man, I'd have my wedding reception here.  But I don't think that marriage will last very long.

Oh look, I've said so many things about this place but didn't even mention the Chilli Fried Turnip Patties.
TRY THE CHILLI FRIED TURNIP PATTIES!
Seriously."}
{"text":"The seafood congee was awesome, but remember to ask for less ginger (cause theres too much) and add the hot sauce (not really spicy) into it, makes it even better."}
{"text":"Pretty good Chinese food but service could be a hit or miss sometimes. Note: they charged $1 if you want to add spicy to anything (like why?)"}
{"text":"I rarely come to this Congee Wong location since I know the one in the Peachtree Plaza consistently serves better food (or Congee Queen).
We wanted to get some XLB (at Ding Tai Fung), congee and squid so we decided to get take away and enjoy the comforts of home. 
We ordered:
- Deep fried squid tentacles (rubbery, bland and surprisingly small portion)
- Turnip patties (okay, but not as flavourful)
- Pork and preserved egg congee (didn't get to taste it)
Service was quick and the place was packed, but the food was not as good as I remember. I expect more from Chinese restaurants in Markham, so this was a bit dissapointing."}
{"text":"Arrived just before noon on a Friday and we were seated almost right away. But within the next half hour, people filled up the place with long waits.

Hugest bowl of congee! More than enough for 5 people
Congee lacked salt, not a bad thing

Everything here was on par with hat you can get from New York's Chinatown
Chicken chow mein
Beef chow fun

Tip: Limited parking, show up early"}
{"text":"If Congee Queen were a sundae, then Congee Wong would be a cup of vanilla ice cream. You're essentially getting the same thing but one has better presentation, better overall appeal, and slightly better things going for it, although both good all the same.

The congee itself to me are almost identical; same size, flavour, selection, and overall satisfaction. As for the other dishes, service, ambiance, cleanliness, I give the edge to Congee Queen. This however doesn't change the big plus that it's in Promenade mall, which is one of my fave malls due to the low traffic, presence of T&T, rainbow cinemas, and the simple fact that's it's nearby."}
{"text":"Pretty average. Came here Thursday night. Waited 5-10 min for a table. It was a bit difficult to get here through the parking garage. Service was not so good. We asked multiple times for hot sauce. 
The congee was good as always. Their fried rice was a bit bland. Their noodles (with beef and veggie) is good."}
{"text":"Being Chinese myself, I didn't expect much from these types of establishments, but this one was particularly horrible. 
Was there for a quick lunch and ended up leaving with our stomachs empty. Congee had traces of metal wool cleaners. Sent it back and the second one had even more in them. Fried turnip cake turned bad and was sour. Table was not properly wiped off after the last sitting. Will never return to this location."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I have been eating here on and off for probably almost a decade. It's become such a norm for myself and my family that I don't even think about writing a Yelp review, because honestly I ate here before I even began using Yelp. 

However, in my most recent visits I came to realize several things which ultimately will stop us from eating here ever again. 

1) There is a lot of corn starch in everything. 
The delicious sauces in all their dishes are thick, viscous, glimmering, and go great with rice and noodles. It wasn't until recently did I learn that a lot of Chinese cooking involved corn starch to thicken sauces. This made me wonder, is the congee really all rice? 

2. I'm always very thirsty afterwards. 
Again, MSG is a key ingredient in a lot Chinese sauces. If you don't believe me just pick up any lee kum kee sauce off the supermarket shelf and take a look at the ingredients on the label and you will be sure to see not only salt but also monosodium glutamate (MSG). 

3. I began to get sub-par quality food when business is slow. 
If I come early enough, when the restaurant is still fairly empty (the dinner rush had not arrived yet), and I order take out, I have to be careful what I order. It must be something that is common, can be made fresh. Sometimes the vegetables aren't so fresh, or the white rice seemed a little older than usual, possibly from the lunch hour. I couldn't help but think that I am getting left-over food from earlier that day, or possibly even from the night before. 

During my last visit, it pushed me over the edge. I ordered curry chicken on rice for take out on Friday just after work. Eating it for dinner, I remember thinking that it didn't taste that good, and that I don't expect a well established restaurant like Congee Wong to feed me with such sub-par quality food. The green peppers in the dish tasted fresh, but the curry sauce and even the chicken itself didn't taste right. Didn't taste fresh. Sure enough, by late evening I had a high fever and diarrhea. I had severe diarrhea throughout the night and lost a lot of liquids in my body. Seeing the doctor the next day confirmed I had been a victim of food poisoning, from viral or bacterial contaminated food.

After this incident, it made me look back at the recent visits, the quality levels, and how it's nowhere near as good as it used to be when they first opened. And now I see the truth. The food at Congee Wong is just not worth the risk anymore."}
{"text":"extremely bad service from the lady sitting behind the counter.
she seems to be an emotional trainwreck.

ordered a dish and requested to have more brisket and no tendon.  lady behind counter decided to run to kitchen and tell them to give me no extra brisket and no tendon. 
so I ended up getting a dish with lots of noodles and half the brisket and zero tendon. 

if I knew this was going to happen I would have wanted to have it the normal way..

didn't bother to bring up the issue.
never going back again..."}
{"text":"get an order of lor bak go (radish cakes?), Singaporean style.  this dish is packed with flavor and crispy pieces of  lor bak go, delicious.  

friendly service, huge portions and fair prices make this place a popular spot.  open late, until 2 am on weekends."}
{"text":"I eat here some 3-4 of the week around mid-night, mostly out of necessity as I work late often and this is on the bus line home. The number one thing this place has going for it is that it is open late, much later than anything else in the vicinity. The food is acceptable, but I would not praise as it as anything special. It does not rise above the average level, and the price is not particularly good value. The waitresses know me as a regular, and yet the consistently the apathetic quality of service never fails to frustrate me. For example, one particular night, there was a live worm in my food - probably crawled out of the veggies in the kitchen on to my plate. Good thing these sort of things don't phase me, I can forgive it. But I was far more agitated by the indifference and total lack of urgency by the staff to make any gesture of compensation. Any other customer would have raised hell, and Whatever. I still came back, again simply from total lack of options. It does beat eating at McDonald's late at night. Would I recommend it to people I care about? Not really."}
{"text":"This is my favourite chinese restaurant in North York! Their service isn't always spot on but there is one waitress that is amazing! The parking can be tricky on the weekend. The food is a very generous portion and damn delicious! I love the eel fried rice, lobster E-Fun noodles and crab maw soup! The crab claw is to die for but it was sold out the last time we were there. My boyfriend really enjoyed the crab maw soup and said it was the best he has ever had. You will definitely have leftovers to take home after."}
{"text":"The newest Congee Wong just opened in Richmond Hill.  They are offering 10% off now for grand opening.  Place is pretty big as it took over the space where the dim sum restaurant used to be - Regal 16.  Decor is nice and modern with a lot of booths.  Staff was extremely polite and attentive.  Always apologizing about how long it took for the food to come but in reality it was only 5-10 mins.  Looking to come here more often as it will be closer to my house."}
{"text":"One of the better congee spots that I've been to, and this is because they give huge portions for an affordable price, and service is very quick. Every time I eat here, servers are very quick and attentive to you. They take your order, and the food comes out fast in 5mins. I've also had times where a server would check up on my table, which is what I call a \"rare event\" because Chinese restaurants are usually very poor in service. The food here is comparable to Congee Queen, tastes good enough to eat! To be honest, I slightly prefer this place over other congee restaurants."}
{"text":"Everything here was bland. Their soy sauce for the steamed fish was bland, their veggies was oily and bland. Avoid this place at all cost."}
{"text":"It's pretty good for the price. I came here twice, and each time, I was full with $15. However, they should clean the pots better between dishes (I've found items that were not part of my order presumably remenant from the previous order)."}
{"text":"Tasty Chinese food! Would probably return often if I was in the area. the cusine is pretty authentic and delicious. Service was standard, the decor was alright. Price is average. An overall nice experience with good food."}
{"text":"Good food. Good price. High recomended for you to eat a lot with minimum budget. Their service is also good."}
{"text":"High quality Cantonese food at a reasonable price, which was the original source of nascent rivals (e.g. Congee Queen and Congee Star) as chefs left Congee Wong to start up their own operations. Unfortunately, I feel like they have fallen off their perch a little bit in the past few years after posting a conditional pass in the health inspection several times. This place used to also have a robbery problem as it always held a lot of cash at the end of the day, but that seems to have been resolved with the installation of cameras. In my opinion, Congee Queen has surpassed them in food quality, restaurant capacity, and ambiance. It's difficult to recommend dishes from Congee Wong because it all comes down to personal preference. Their soupds and noodle soups are good and their congees are excellent."}
{"text":"Very fast service! I usually come weekends for lunch. Usually no wait for tables even though it is really packed. This is probably because of their quick service and quick turnaround.

Food is decent. Portions are decent. Good for families. Dishes for sharing. Your typical Chinese congee and noodles place. 

Parking can be difficult sometimes since its a small plaza with many eateries. Usually the wait for a parking spot isn't long even during busy times."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Waitresses were extremely impolite. To the point we could not accept and left. Never coming back to this restaurant ever again!!!"}
{"text":"Came here to switch it up from our go-to restaurant, Asian Legend. This place had super fast service which is great when you are hungry and for such a busy place. I've been here for Lunch and Dinner. Dinner was great, we ordered a mussel congee and the pad Thai. Both were tasty and the portions were very well sized for the price, the two plates filled us up. Came back for lunch a few days later because the service was so fast and good, it was a lot less busy during lunch hours. We ate beef with black bean sauce on rice (lunch special) and beef with mushroom on a sizzling plate. The lunch special came with a small congee soup and some greens. The congee soup wasn't to tasty and the black bean sauce didn't taste like anything.... especially not black bean sauce. The beef with mushrooms however was very tasty. 

Overall it's good and fast service, food is not as good (in our opinion) as the Asian Legend we go to in the same plaza...BUT our bill is a lot cheaper because the portion sizes are a lot bigger here so we order less. I will keep coming here if I need to satisfy a fast craving for Chinese food and I don't want to make a big of a dent in my wallet then I would otherwise."}
{"text":"Consider Congee Wong a Chinese \"greasy spoon\" + a tablespoon of MSG for good measure! I'm not a hater, I actually love this place for value and flavour. But be sure to swig a litre of water or tea on your way out, lest you get the msg-pasties.

This is Chinese food, and of the cheap sort at its best! Order lots and take home lots. I've watched many other diners do this - at times a table of 2 will order 6 items, eat a bit of each, and pack the rest to go for 2 weeks worth of brown-bag lunches.

Mmm... and what enviable lunches you'll feast on.

A must try here is the curried chicken with potatoes. The sauce is thick and packs a punch, unlike watery and bland options typical of Thai-style joints. 

I absolutely agree with Maple's comment on the Lo Bak Gau (below). So deliciously soft with little crispy edges, the right amount of heat, shrimp, eggs... yum. 

And if you're on a diet - get congee. Who knew rice and water could be so tasty?! 

Service is meh, but you don't go for the service... grab take-out otherwise."}
{"text":"I ordered off their lunch menu and wow! The serving was quite amazing. On top of the generous amount of rice and chicken, they also served a spring roll, soup, and salad.

The staff was quick and seated me immediately even if it was peak hour. I can't say the same with group of people, though, since I went alone. 

Will definitely come back to try out other dishes."}
{"text":"This place is a great fast food style Chinese restaurant.  The atmosphere is loud and the decor is similar to most Chinese restaurants you'll see around Richmond Hill and Markam.  The service is decent and the food comes out lightning fast!

My gf and I usually order the fried sliced turnips, sea food congee and a noodle dish of some kind.   The Hong Kong style tea is also great and will keep you awake all night!  Most of the food is prepared fresh and the wait times are very low if you are dining in or getting take out. 

My favourite of all the Congee Wong locations and the one that provides us with the biggest portions!  I will be coming back for more soon!"}
{"text":"As much as I enjoy Congee Queen, Congee Wong is the OG of congee in North York (IMO).

Generous portions, tasty dishes, very reasonable prices for the amount and quality of food being served.  

Service is efficient.  

I can eat 2-3 meals from one order of fried noodles!  How can you go wrong?!  

Afternoon tea is the best deal: From 3-5pm on weekdays, order a dish from the special menu and you get a free drink.  You can choose from bubble tea, red bean with ice cream (it's like a red bean milkshake!), etc."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I had a rough night!  I had a hangover from Friday from attempting the \"Century Club.\"  If someone challenges you...don't even do it...walk away!  But I'm in the club, it's still worth it =)  My girlfriend was sick and lost her voice.  I was thinking comfort food and decide on congee.  What's a better place than \"Congee Wong\" (a 5 min drive) or \"Congee Queen\" both owned by the same owner.

I ordered take-out and brought congee as it's their speciality but others are just as good.  We've ordered a red-bean ice cream freeze, honey lemon, mince beef rice roll, preserve egg & lean pork Congee, and pork liver & kidney Congee all under $20.  It was tasty as always.  My girlfriend's Bulgarian, she loved it but she's open-minded.  Most Caucasians find our food weird.  Her dad thought it smelled like shoe, I'm not aware of it but they're not use to it.  Overall, it was delicious and what I needed!"}
{"text":"It's no Congee Queen, but Congee Wong has always had a place in my heart (and stomach) for 
1. being the first fast-food congee place I ever ate at in the t-dot
2. being close to my home (walking distance, what!)
3. being cheap. very important during school years
4. being filling. also very important during school years
5. being tasty. MSG-laden tastiness.
6. being entertaining. I love how the servers communicate.

It's no surprise that this place is always busy for reasons 3 -5 above, no matter what time of day. Obvious winners include the congee, it's crazy-full of MSG but doesn't contain ginger (shredded ginger in congee is my sworn enemy). The stir-fried turnip cakes are some of the tastiest around (again, thanks to the MSG), but it always arrives looking like mush, and you're pretty lucky if you can actually get a few cubes out in tact. Beware the shrimp in this dish is sometimes suspect.

The fried noodles and rice dishes are large and plentiful. They've got quick service and are fast to refill a teapot. The place is loud, so be prepared to use your outside voice. The servers have some secret language that involves loud whispering, it's intriguing and makes me want to whisper loudly as well, just to fit in (or throw them off, whichever).

Overall, it's a place to get full for cheap. It's always a staple when I'm in town for a visit; I secretly love that I hydrate really well after a meal here..."}
{"text":"Man this place is so good I'm speechless. While visiting Toronto we heard this place has the best congee and noodles so we had to give it a try. Place is packs and busy so it must be good. We got seated and ordered wonton noodles and Eel fried rice. Hands down the best wontons I've had in a long time( Hong Kong has the best) you will not find such authentic food in NYC."}
{"text":"AMAZING! AMAZING! AMAZING!

I drove 8+ hours to go to Canada to eat THIS FOOD. It was SOOOO worth it. I mainly had the Yeung Chow Fried Rice and it was simply HEAVENLY. The rice isn't heavily MSG'd like most other chinese restaurants and the rice was cooked so flavourfully. WOW. The wontons are filled with a big shrimp nugget. Cheap pork filling crap? PSH. Not here. I also tried the Beef Chow Fun and it made me go OMG WOW. All I can say is, when I dream about chinese food, I dream about Congee Wong. 

If you haven't experienced this stuff, you need to hitch up there, and video tape yourself eating it so that way, when you come back to whatever state you're in, you can remind yourself how great that food tasted while you snack on something lame."}
{"text":"Much like an average Chinese restaurant. The servers come once in a while and not the friendliest compared to other non chinese restaurants. It took several tries to get one of the servers to come take our order and get the bill afterwards. Surprisingly the food came out decently quick and one of the server even came up and apologized for one of the dish because the bok choy were not the fresh.. so we cancelled it even though it was already made. As for the noise level.. it is quite packed and loud from people conversing. Overall, it was just okay portions are decently big so I would only recommend it for cheap big group gatherings."}
{"text":"DH and I have been coming here since 2008 (usually 2-3x a year) along with places such as Keungs on Kennedy and Keung's Delight near the T&T Market. Every time we come to Toronto/Markham this is literally our first stop even before going to our hotel.  On this occasion we brought the in-laws with us, since it has been years since they had been to Toronto. I have always thought they secretly did not not understand why we always went to Toronto, but by the time the first stir fried turnip cake and sip of congee went into their mouths, they were sold. 

We ordered our usual dishes: 

stir fried turnip cakes
seafood congee
crispy rice hot pot with chinese sausage and spare ribs

and also got two special dishes:
garlic shrimp (served similar to salty spicy shrimp with shells on)
scallop with tofu and black bean sauce.

I would have to say that our usual dishes were their normal deliciousness, although I do think they changes the style of how they cooked the turnip cakes (good, nonetheless).  My MIL thought that the crispy rice was so good that I thought she was going to eat the pot too. She went to town attacking the pot to get every grain of crispy rice.  

The look of satisfaction on their faces after finishing each dish was priceless - my FIL commented that it was just like eating in hometown china, and was something we just don't quite have in Michigan."}
{"text":"A classic Chinese restaurant, serving you quick and tasty Chinese food. Great business hours, so if you're ever craving some flavourful food late at night, this is the place to go. Also, conveniently located inside the promenade mall. Been going here for years now and some of the statement dishes we all order include the sweet and sour chicken, noodles with beef, deep fried turnip patties, beef brisket, and fried rice. Heads up, sometimes there is an automatic 10% service charge depending on your party size and order."}
{"text":"We beat the lunch hour rush and were seated right away, which was fortunate as the almost empty restaurant was packed by the time we were done.  The 3 dishes we ordered came at super speed.  The warming congee and the Singaporean-style turnip cake mentioned by other reviewers definitely hit the spot on a wet winter day!  The last fried rice dish was massive and felt like greasy rice with not quite enough actual 'stuff'.  I wasn't too concerned though as I was only to happy to eat my way through the first two dishes."}
{"text":"$7.50 each for a group of six and a half people (the half person paid a few bucks) for 6 large portioned dishes, including tea, tax and tip = great value!  Congee Wong is often our default Chinese restaurant for random get togethers due to its central location from all four directions in the GTA.  It's the common denominator taste wise.  Nothing too great to brag about and nothing so bad that no one would eat it.  It also has enough menu choices so that most people shouldn't go home hungry.  The lines are often long, though they do move quickly.  Its a good choice for large groups if you're willing to wait a little."}
{"text":"Went to the Congee Wong at this location a few times since it opened.
Service has always being great (5-star) but the food quality has been so so.  For example, the curry beef rice sauce was watery and had barely have any flavor.   Most people would say never go to Chinese restaurants for curry, but some of the Chinese restaurants in the area serve great tasting curry beef rice.   I wasn't impress with their bake dishes and either.

Will try this location again in a few months since I am a fan of Congee Wong."}
{"text":"Such good food and everything comes super fast!  4 people can have breakfast for $20.  I really wish I could go every morning if I had the time.  
My only complaint is the long wait to get tables, but expected of such a popular place."}
{"text":"I always come here as my kids can be rather picky and is my go to when cooking is not on my mind. Its always busy especially being inside the mall and beside tnt super market. I can say the food is consistent and decent. I almost always eat the same dishes: turnip patties, salt and pepper squid, fried rice noodle with beef and soya sauce, fried rice noodle with beef and vegetables, fried rice with shrimp in cream sauce and a couple of others. Anything outside of their regular menu expect to pay between $15-$20, although it  is not their specialty but I guess thats the surcharge for going above and beyond. Customer service is barely there, people who don't smile, greet or check in. Decent eats at a decent price. Gets the job done."}
{"text":"Alright. If you're looking for a cheap, Hong Kong style restaurant with decent food and extremely fast service, Congee Wong is a great bet. Although I've only recently started making Yelp reviews, I have been to Congee Wong at least 10 times this year; it's close to where I live, and it's so affordable that you can take your savings and head right next door and get a dessert at Petit Potato too . 

I usually have their sizzling satay beef plate and a side of rice. Their portions are so healthy that I often pack my leftovers to go. Their food can be a little salty at times, but they will respect it if you ask your food to be served without msg or less salt. 

Great place, I recommend it highly."}
{"text":"The food at this place is pretty good, however the customer service at this location is terrible, especially the short haired lady taking orders over the phone. Been ordering take out here every single week, for the past 5 weeks. Lady was arguing with me over the phone, and when i picked up my order about giving me a few extra hot sauce, really? Learn to appreciate returning business. On top of that she took my order wrong and I had to wait an extra 15 mins, I thought the whole point of calling ahead was to have it ready and go. Not impressed, there's many other restaurants where they treat you better."}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner when the restaurant we wanted to get into was full, and this was a good find!
It was just the two of us for dinner, so we only had a couple of dishes, none of which were the signature congee, surprisingly. The clams in black bean chii sauce were excellent - not overcooked, with a very nice sauce. The stewed beef tendons were also very good, though their version is a bit on the sweet side. The shrimp in eggplant hot pot was really good - large shrimp, not overcooked, in a delicious eggplant and vegetable stew. Last we ordered the lobster with ginger and green onion with rice cake, and that was also very good.
Each of the dishes was very nicely done, the seafood was not overcooked, and the sauces were flavourful and nicely balanced with the dishes.
I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Congee is really smooth and tasty. Great comfort food for me. We also ordered the beef chow fun which was huge in portion. I would come back."}
{"text":"I have gone to Congee Wong for years now, Promenade being one of the first of all the locations I have tried. The food has gone from great to average for me unfortunately as the years have passed. The service is slow and the restaurant outdated. I much prefer to eat at TNT where the seats are out in the open of the mall and the surroundings much more pleasant and clean."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty! The congee was great, an the dishes were pretty good, albeit on he salty side. We enjoyed our time and the food here in the Toronto area. A bit overwhelmed, we ordered off pictures instead of just going off the menu itself. Next time we visit we'll branch out. Have to say, the quality of Cantonese food in Markham/North York is leaps and bounds better than in NYC.

Congee was pretty good, and the jah gwei cheung was freshly fried, crispy and soft. The other dishes were good. we over-ordered as usual but enjoyed the food!"}
{"text":"A family favourite. We always come here to order the usual stir fry noodles, Chinese fried donut, efu noodles, egg drop soup, fried rice, and radish patties. Service and food has always been consistent!"}
{"text":"my go to place with my family!!!! portions are huge, not only do we get super full, we always end up taking left overs home because we couldn't finish it. Super cheap and delicious!! However, this place is always busy... should make reservation if you don't want to wait in line."}
{"text":"Congee Wong has made many of my sick days a lot more pleasant...have a sore throat...cant eat??? order a bowl of congee ...order some dough fritters on the side...the warmth soothes the neck and with the pepper sauce mixed in...the congee is amazing...dont get me wrong, there are other items on the menu that are wonderful as well...authentic chinese style...i have pleased a lot of sick friends by bringing them some congee when they were sick!"}
{"text":"Double check the bill before you pay. They add tips already and the credit card machine will still ask for the tips. The waitress served us changed one of our order to a similar but 2 times more expensive one without asking us, and when we found out the price difference before we pay, her explain was that she made the change because the expensive one tasted better, and we ate it then we need to pay. The dishes are alright, but what kind of sneaky business they are running here?!  Anyone still considering go there just be cautious of that ridiculous waitress. I won't go back and definitely won't recommend this location to my friends!"}
{"text":"The best congee place I've tried. We come here with large groups because of the shareable dishes and you want a bit of everything here. The seafood congee, Peking duck, spicy fried calamari, Chinese broccoli are all must haves. Expect to wait a bit to be seated because it does get very busy. Also, the service isn't the best. However, your food comes quickly and the food itself plus the prices are unbeatable."}
{"text":"Typical 'noodle congee' Chinese place....Loved the big portions and good 'bang for the buck.' There was one fried rice with scallops I think called seafood with garlic fried rice... probably my favorite dish there! Found the stir fried noodles to be too oily even after we specifically asked for it to be less, but I guess thats typical! 3.5/5 but Im in a good mood today!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place for the last couple of years. It has been on and off, but it is good for when anyone has a cold or fever. Usually when sick, you would eat congee, and not many places beat this place in terms of congee. 

I always eat the special congee with seafood. If not this, then the lean pork with the thousand year egg. I can't say that there is much to the dish...i mean its congee...liquid rice with many other different ingredients to give it flavour. 

The problem with congee is that you will feel hungry after about 2 hours. You have to eat a lot to be full. 

We went when they were about to close. Service was pretty bad. They were beginning to sit down and eat their own dinner. I can understand...its been a long day, but when we have to wait 10 minutes, the impression isn't very good. I saw a guest waiting by the door while they were eating as they didn't look to the door. I guess I should go when it isn't about closing time. 

I cant really measure atmosphere. It was close to closing. Not many people. 

Overall, a good impression, but could have been better."}
{"text":"This food was actually extremely bad. I had a sample of several menu items, including the marinated duck noodle soup, the curry pad Thai with bean curd and the chicken chow mein. The pad Thai was so over cooked, all the noodles were stuck together. It had hardly any flavor at all, it was limp and pathetic. The soups had this very sour, bad odor. The soup broth was salty I couldn't taste anything else, what an immense waste of $."}
{"text":"Food: always consistent, cheap and delicious. However you should not expect any service from the waiter/waitresses, as they seem to not care about the customers. There is no greetings and farewell. They do bring the food quickly though"}
{"text":"I came here at 8 pm on a Wednesday night and was seated at a large table that could be shared with strangers. It was quite busy. Service is so so here. It's ok-fast and ok-friendly. I was told that congee places in Toronto are not as great as Vancouver so I was surprised as I found that this place was probably on par with the ones I go to in Vancouver.

I got a thousand year egg and fish slice congee for $5.50. It was quite thick and had a lot of stuff in it. The fish was a little fishy. 

We also got an eel fried rice. I really liked this! It came with seaweed and bonito flakes on top. Although it did not have a lot of eel chunks, they were large sized, I would say. I have never had a Chinese style eel fried rice in Vancouver before, so this was awesome! I even had it for breakfast the next day.

I might come again if I lived here. But since I'm only here for a few weeks I want to try as many different things as possible! I hear their afternoon tea deal is pretty good."}
{"text":"Whenever I crave congee, soft crab fried rice, or spicy eggplant, I just give them a call and have it delivered. Delivery only after 4 pm."}
{"text":"Went to this location on Sunday night at about 6 PM I was pretty surprised with the number of available tables at the time but I shrugged it off and continued on.  I was seated immediately and proceeded to order my favorite dish - Beef and vegetables in black bean sauce Chow Mein.

When my dish was arrived  it seemed quite drenched in gravy/sauce this is different from the other locations of Congee Wong that i have visited and i was disappointed how drenched the noodles were but other than that the dish was fine. I overheard a complaint from a neighboring table where the customer says that he was allergic to shrimp yet when the order arrived there was still shrimp on the dish and the customer was very furious and yelling at the waitress.  i was actually a little bit scared and worried for the safety of myself and my friend.  After a short argument that customer stormed out the window and said he hates Chinese restaurants and Chinese food.  Other then that I finished my meal and got my cheque, perhaps the customer service at this location isn't the best and therefore why there were so many empty tables that evening."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for the past 15 years. This isn't your everyday Chinese restaurant. Congee is a rice  porridge and in essence a specific cooking style. I find it a lot tastier than other traditional Chinese dishes. There's a wide variety of other dishes in Congee Wong palatable to many. Prices are very reasonable and service is fast. During lunch or dinner time, you may have to wait a while for your table but it's worth it. Hope you get to try this place at least once and enjoy it."}
{"text":"I usually come here for congee and nothing to really complain about for food.  Service on the other hand was very awkward.  I came here an hour before close.  We literally ate in 15 mins.  The waitress was on our case the entire time.  About closing up. Bill came at the same time as our food. When we left, they were all cleaned up. Register was closing and we still had 30 mins till their official close time."}
{"text":"When you consider:
1) This place is authentic - how do I know?  The waiters and waitress don't smile and can, at times ignore you, just like in Hong Kong. ;-)
2) The prices for how much you actually get
3) The taste for how much you pay

These three things, when considered as a whole, forces me to give it a 5 star rating.

Independently, the price isn't the best - there's cheaper Chinese joints out there. Certainly, the quantity is great, but there are other joints that give you just as much for what you pay.  And in terms of taste, no HK Cantonese will tell you this is the best, most delicious Cantonese food they've ever eaten in Toronto - it's simply not true....but combine all three aspects and there aren't many restaurants that can compete with Congee Wong...well, yes, Congee Queen, and Congee Time would be exceptions as they follow the same formula.

If you have a family outing and you want to save some $$$ but not at the cost of everyone's enjoyment, come here.

Downtown folks who believe they have the best options downtown don't know what they are missing."}
{"text":"Congee Wong has become a staple for me, every time I visit the Great White North.  Wontons, fried noodles, congee, calamari, everything I've tried has been great.  Can't wait to visit again next year!"}
{"text":"Delivery was so fast like 10 mins! Wow  ....we got the 4 dish special and it was pretty tasty and fresh.  The general tao was not as flavorful  as im used to but i don't  do a lot of take out. Id order again."}
{"text":"Good service! 
Will come again! 

Food is bit of oily in my opinion. But overall I would say it's a decent restaurant."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese Food ive had in a long time. Ordered the chicken chow mien, schezuan shrimp, general toa chicken and the deep fried shrimp wonton. The food was great and the portions were large. Delivery was under an hour and the food was still hott. The only negative thing is delivery is cash only . Will definitely order again."}
{"text":"This place is generally better.  I was first introduced to Congee Wong by my sister a few years back and I've loved them ever since.  On this last visit however, I don't know if it was because they were super busy or what but the service was bad tonight.  They were slow and I usually don't have to ask twice for water here but I did this time.  If I had to rate just this visit, I would give it a 3 because of service.  That being said, the food was still just fantastic and I know that usually, the service is better.  Just better though.  Not exceptional.  More efficient if anything.  I love the food here and as others have written, you have to try the Fried Chili Turnip cakes.  On this visit, we had the chili fried turnip, bok choy with mushrooms and the house pad Thai.  This was far too much for 2 people but at $27.80, I can't complain.... Left overs are yum.  I don't know if I've ever had \"real\" Pad Thai, my company told me it wasn't.  I'm generally not a fan of Pad Thai but I love eating, so I tried some.  Not a fan but there were tons of shrimp, chicken, egg and tofu in it and I mean, tons of shrimp.  The bok choy with mushrooms was delicious and they served us a huge plate.  No complaints here.  The turnip cakes:  I need to find out the secret because I can't help myself when these are placed in front of me.  Sooo, will I be back?  You bethca!  My regular dishes I usually get with more friends/family are:  Seafood Congee, Chili fried turnip cakes, Cantonese Chow Mein, Fried shrimp wontons, shrimp fried rice and then we usually get one other random dish.  Yes, this is a ton of food and of course we bring some home those are my favs.  Give em a try and enjoy your meal!"}
{"text":"I order from Congee Wong all the time and although the customer service might not be amazing...the food more than makes up for it!  The Cantonese Chow Mein and the Salt and Pepper Squid are awesome.  Their delivery is always super fast too.  I've dined in several times but I much prefer their take-out/delivery."}
{"text":"Congee Wong is your typical Chinese restaurant.  You know its going to be food served fast, hot, tasty but also nothing super special.  Except that super delicious beef and vegetable fried noodles! !!  Their congee is also super delicious, thick (versus watery) style congee.  They also provide lots of ingredients so its filled to the brim with whatever else you order and put in the congee.  Their fried squid tentacles and chicken wings are done asian style, and not over breaded, but just enough where you can appreciate the both meat and breading!  A solid go to place for a quick cheap bite!"}
{"text":"TLDR: tip hungry restaurant offering poor service. DON'T COME HERE.

1st visit: came with a friend. Place was busy at lunchtime. We tried to order in English and the server demanded that we speak Chinese. I did not understand why she assumed we spoke Chinese, as my friend, albeit an Asian, was raised in Canada and was not as fluent in Chinese as in English. But we followed her \"command\" anyways. When the bill came, I noticed there was a 10% tip automatically added to the bill. 

2nd visit: came with the same friend for late dinner. The restaurant was empty. Received better service this time. Given my last dining experience I did not leave a tip just as last time, as I assumed it was added to the bill already. However when we walked up to the counter, the woman there took a look at the bill and advised that we did not tip. Only then did I realized that the tip was not added to the bill this time! I felt super embarrassed for her pointing it out to us, like we were two stingy guys who never pay gratuity. However it was them who made everything so confusing and inconsistent since the mandatory tip thing was not indicated anywhere in the restaurant.. Do they only do this on select customers? I don't know man

The woman started demanding a tip. Yet I rarely take cash with me and my friend just had a few loose dimes. She then advised that we could swiped our debit card again for the tip. At this point it became really awkward and I did not know what to say and got very upset. She probably noticed that and let us go.

I am more than honest in this review. The food was actually not bad so go at your own risk. I do recommend the Leslie/Finch location though, unlike this one :)"}
{"text":"Well, my updated review actually stayed in the draft with a five star rating since the food and service had been excellent... till the last time we were here. Service was a bit iffy and it was difficult to get the servers' attention, especially when we finished our food and needed the bill. They just walked past us real fast. Finally I called out to one lady and she got the bill for us. 

I do found the younger servers on the weekend more friendly and attentive, and the male manager too.

But the food always comes out quick with great taste and I endorse that. Rice noodle rolls are great with a lot of fillings and congee is poppin hot and delicious."}
{"text":"The Good: They now offer a menu with just photos, not of all dishes, but of most. This is convenient to know exactly what new dish to try as thats how its going to look when they bring it out.

The Bad: I much prefer the Leslie/Finch location to this one. Prices are a tad higher here (maybe due to location in a mall and also across T&T?), portions are a lot smaller in my opinion, and service is the typical congee HK quick style but a lot less attentive. We received the wrong bill last time and no sauces/chili. Also not sure if its just me, but the food presentation here is super sloppy, even for a Congee Wong.

I did enjoy the taste of their szechuan sauced seafood dish but for $17 before tax and tip, the amount was tiny with vegetables thrown in to hide the lack of seafood (the spoon in the photo is a normal sized one, not one of those huge sharing spoons). Even their other dishes are noticeably smaller portioned than their sister restaurant. Everything still was edible and quick hence three stars."}
{"text":"Classic place for when you want late night chinese food! Very cheap and worth the money! I'm a huge fan of the tendon noodles in soup. They are always busy but always have time to accommodate new customers without making them wait. Very quick and efficient service!"}
{"text":"Came here with my parents as soon as they opened on a Monday morning. We were the second table to be seated but there was already a stream of people getting take - out.

We ordered the seafood congee with a plate of fried dough sticks, a beef noodle soup, turnip cakes, and seafood fried rice. All the food came out super fast though service in general wasn't the best (had to ask multiple times for soy sauce and boxes). In our eyes food is more important and man was it good. Like many have stated, the portions are huge and prices good too. Even with the three of us, we barely finished the congee, dough sticks and beef noodle soup. We ended up taking the turnip cake and fried rice home. Even cold and a few days old they were delicious :) 

We will definately be coming back and ordering the same thing again (maybe minus the beef noodle soup so we can enjoy more of the delicious fried rice :Q)!"}
{"text":"One of the best chinese restaurants ever. It opens late, they give big portions for the money you pay, and the food is delicious. The staff is quick and the food comes out quick. The interior is brightly lit and clean...it's just so awesome. 

I get congee take-out from here when I'm sick too."}
{"text":"Grew up going to this Congee Wong at Leslie/Finch. In my opinion, this is the original \"Congee Queen\". Ridiculous portions and prices. Don't expect top notch service as they are the quick and efficient type.

Classic cantonese style food. My favourite is their fried rice noodles with shrimps and scrambled egg sauce. 

Also recommend always ordering the seafood congee & turnip cake appetizer. My sister says their sweet and sour pork are bomb too."}
{"text":"Anything less than 5 stars for this place is, I daresay, blasphemy

Having grown up a few blocks from this place, I ate here almost on a weekly basis during my high school years. Virtually everyone I knew has good things to say about this place--the authenticity of the \"wok\" taste, the low prices, the homely/cozy atmosphere, the large menu with wide varieties of items, and perhaps most importantly, the fact that it opens well after midnight!

No wonder parking is always a problem

Even with the large number of chinese food places springing up in the Toronto area, this place has stood the test of time for many years!

Definitely one of the places I always visit at least once whenever I visit Toronto"}
{"text":"My family & I have been going to congee Wong restaurant for as long as I can remember...Leslie and finch original location of my first congee Wong experience till they have expanded different locations in promenade mall and steeles and don mills \"congee queen\" I've seen their staff move from one location to the next. I really didn't like the service we had here at this location. The staff were not friendly and ignored customers even when you're waving at them for help. The food quality is not good either. I won't be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Congee Wong is our default to go place to eat when we are hungry and need a good ole standby.  We have never been disappointed with anything we have ordered.  

On a cold winter day, their congee can warm you from your head to your toes.  We always order the fish and blood congee.  It does not sound appetizing, but it's great when you put lots of hot sauce on it.  

Our favourites are the Singapore noodles, Crispy Chicken, Mapo Dofu, Spicy Salt Shrimp with the skin on, and Green Beans with minced meat.  

The portions are huge so you can \"dogey\" bag the rest of the food for one or two more meals for the next day or two.  

Have never been disappointed and the service is always very good.  We can get in and out in 30 minutes flat if we are in a rush.

I gave it a 4 star when I was writing the review but went back and gave it a 5 star because they are just so darn good and their food has been consistent for the umpteen years that we have been there.  So 5 Stars it is!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has wide selection of foods, including rice, noodles and congee.  We ordered fried rice with chicken, fried noodles with roast duck, Singapore noodles and barbeque pork rice rolls.

Food: The Singapore noodles is not spicy enough.  The other dishes are okay.  The BBQ pork is a little bit fat.
Drinks: I ordered the ice milk black tea.  Tea was strong.  We ordered the strawberry drink but it was not available.  Strawberries are already available in groceries, so we expect a restaurant to have them.
Service: waiters and waitresses are pretty friendly, better than most low-medium price Chinese restaurants.
Cleanliness - very clean, compared to most low-medium price Chinese restaurants.
Price: reasonable.  About $10 for a dish of rice or noodles
Portion: huge, a dish of rice or noodles can be shared among 2-3 adults.
Parking: the parking lot is always full in this plaza.  You have to park at the back of the building."}
{"text":"This place holds a special place in my heart. Used to come here often when I went to chiro school. Typical Chinese restaurant. Don't expect high level of service but the food is banged out at a super fast pace. Food is great. Prices are great. Try the turnip cakes and yin yang fried rice."}
{"text":"Love this place. Guys if you're looking for some nice and tasty Chinese food this is the place to go to. The waiters and waitresses are super nice even though at times they might not look like. Very quick service. If you're in a rush and had to be somewhere within an hour this this place will have you finished and full within minutes."}
{"text":"I rarely visit any restaurant starting with the word \"Congee\" but those are the places where I recognize the cuisine most as I grew up on these.  Saturday night we  looked through the typical extensive Menu and decided on the following while getting the usual efficient treatment and speedy Food arrival.

Baby Bokchoy($7+) - Fried nicely still with some crunch.  Not over salted and no sandy residue mades this an A-OK dish.  Portion size was decent as well enough for 2 or more to share.   2.5 *Star*

Preserved Veg & Duck Meat on Vermicelli($11+) - Normal ingredients and typical flavours while plentiful as we got a larger serving.  Actually enough Rice Vermicelli to feed a Cow.  Felt lacking on the Duck Meat department while almost seemed replaced by Beansprouts.

Ground Pork on Hot Pot Rice(20min required) - Crunchy rice like Dolsot but the Vegetable was cooked til mushy.  Probably won't order this Hot Pot variety next time.  Better yet, go to Tracy Desserts for Hot Pot of the Pigeon variety."}
{"text":"I wish there was a place like this in the SF Bay Area.  The food in Toronto is just so much better than in the Bay.  The wait in line can be close to intolerable, so be prepared for it.

Every dish we ordered has a certain special \"oomph\" above the regular way these entrees are usually served.  I usually avoid fried rice, but I found the eel fried rice to be my favorite dish - the individual ingredients blended well together, and the eel meat just made each bite better.  We also ordered some chow mein as \"filler\", but our table devoured that dish completely.  The milk pudding cubes were a wonderful dessert followup.  Our table of 9 cleaned up 8 dishes... no leftovers.  We visited this place twice on our vacation."}
{"text":"Typical chinese food at an average price. We got 4 items for takeout, signature congee, pan-fried beef rice roll, beef tendon, and oyster mushroom with \"dou miu\" (green sprouts). Beef tendon was done right, rest are average.

Quick service but no discount when paying in cash."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great for large groups and relatively cheap. Recommended."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for fast, cheap, and delicious chinese food. I always order a chicken fried rice and sweet and sour chicken - both good enough for 2-3 people for under $20 total. Portions are large and service is very fast!"}
{"text":"I used to go to Congee Wong every single Friday! It was a ritual that my friend and I had. We used to order the same thing, and would just devour it like there was no tomorrow. Well a lot of things have changed between then and now, and though I don't go nearly as much as I would like, I still love Congee Wong.

One thing about Congee Wong that everyone should know, is that it gets busy! Weekends and Friday nights especially. It's a pretty popular restaurant.  Another thing you should know, their menu is extensive, so know what you want or feel like before you get there. Or you'll be sifting through their menu for hours trying to decide. 

A popular dish is the turnip cakes. They are medium spicy and absolutely the bomb! Their hot and sour soup is something I always get as well.. I like their dough fritters wrapped in a rice noodle roll, you get peanut butter sauce and a hosin sauce to go with it.. mmmmmmm 

I'm not big on congee, so I really can't direct you to a good congee.. They have a wide selection, so it's just a matter of what meat/seafood option you feel like really. 

All this congee wong talk has got me craving it now! Time to hit up some old contacts!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice with some co-workers now. I think a lot of issues point to just poor service. 

The food is decent. I think it's fairly priced for the portion sizes. Dishes lean towards the saltier side, so if you do not like dishes to be too salty, I wouldn't recommend it to you. 

The first time I went with a Cantonese-speaking co-worker and the experience was ok. Service wise they just leave you to yourself, but bring food quickly. But after if you need anything else (ex. Napkins, cutlery etc.) it becomes a challenge. 

Second time, I went with people who do not know how to fluently speak Chinese and service became a different story. We went up and I started off by asking to split the bill (3 people) in Chinese, and the lady was fine but advised us under $10 you can't use debit/you get a surcharge. That was fine. 

When my coworker said what dish was his in English and he would pay with debit (dish was $12) she suddenly got upset and kept repeating the debit rules. My bill was under $10 but I had cash, but she fixated on that one bill and was getting super frustrated with us. She spoke in a very condescending tone, like we didn't understand what she was telling us. 

We eventually paid, but she made paying the bill more difficult/unpleasant than it needed to be. 

Oh. I'm also pretty sure one of the fish in the tank was dead. It was upside down/sometimes vertical, being swirled and tossed around by the jet, while all his friends were swimming around. 

Overall the food is ok. Service needs improvement. I'd only come back if my co-workers really want to go again."}
{"text":"The food here is decent (prefer Congee Queen though) and the service is fast. But geez, the servers here are so rude! They literally throw the dishes on the table, pushing whatever is there out of their way. The plates are teetering on the edge and they just walk away. I asked a waitress to bring me another set of chopsticks and when she came back, she made this \"psh psh\" noise to get my attention... Seriously? What a Neanderthal. That was a first for me, and will also be the last as I won't be coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Think four words - bugs in your food. How dirty is the kitchen is when the take out crispy tiger shrimp comes with roaches. 
Absolutely disgusting. 
Go ahead and take your chances. Lots of people rate it 4 stars. They must like the crispy critters."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place and was excited upon seeing and tasting my congee when it arrived.  

The Chinese donuts were hot and fresh and the congee had a good flavor to it.  I have two simple tests for congee. 

1.  Does it have a good flavor without having to add chili oil or soy sauce.  Most places just cook a giant pot of plain congee and then add the ingredients to order.  The good places spend some extra time cooking the plain congee with the ingredients you chose so that the ingredient flavors are imparted to the plain congee. 

2. Is the consistency good and does it stay good.  Poor quality congee turns watery after a little while because it's cooked with starch and other binding agents to \"shortcut\" the slow simmer process

Congee Wong passes the first test but fails the second one horribly.   My congee basically turned into water half way in.  Fail."}
{"text":"Fairly standard for a congee place. Reiterating others' comments, super busy. Ordered takeout here on Saturday night. Shredded pork chow mein and beef tendon & brisket soup noodle. Asked for chow mein noodles to be super crispy. They weren't. The container of sauce for the chow mein is larger than I'm used to, so I suppose it's a good thing. I'd rather more noodles than more sauce though. The beef tendon and brisket soup noodle was fairly standard. My mom said the color on the tendon (more on the red/orange side, looked very artificial.

Plus: I called in my order ahead on the phone and the woman who answered the phone spoke in really good English. I was super confused. I thought I called the wrong place."}
{"text":"Congee Wong - oh how do I love thee! You are my comfort food! for when I'm sick, when I'm happy, when I'm sad and even when I'm in LOVE!!!!

I love their pan friend turnip cakes (they are diced then fried with chicken, chili's, egg) so awesome! Love their salt and pepper squid, their awesome selection of congee and veggies!

Cheap! Open late! (came here at 12:30am on Thursday) and went to bed with a full belly - that makes me HAPPY!"}
{"text":"I've been a regular at this restaurant for almost 10 years now.  It's been awhile since I dined in at the restaurant, so I can't really say much about the service. I usually get a take-out.  Regardless, I can say that their food is pretty good, and lots in portion too! it has been consistent over the years as well.  You should definitely give this place a try if you havenmt."}
{"text":"If you like big portions, but generic, whitewashed Cantonese (Southern China) food, Congee Wong is the place for you. My family of 5 came last night for dinner around 6PM and the place was super packed! We did manage to snag a booth within 15 minutes of waiting though, but reservations might have been a good idea beforehand. 

3/5 Customer service: Most of the servers know how to speak Canto, Mando, and English. Service is very slow, so self-advocacy here is crucial.

3/5 Food: Pros include English translations on all of their menus and not super salty... Until after the meal, then all you'll want is to drink water for the rest of the night (yay MSG and sodium). Here they clearly want to cater to westerners as well because many of the menu options are quite standard, i.e. BBQ, ramen. The congees are flawless, but not enough other ingredients besides rice in my opinion. The little bits of meat, egg, seafood, veggies, etc are tiny, so you really have to search for them within the congee. The steamed tofu was surprisingly delicious and beautifully presented! I also strongly recommend the king mushroom+tofu sheets+seasonal greens veggie dish. Lots of cornstarch used.

NOT very vegetarian/vegan friendly. E.g. all the rice roll options contain meat. Most of the congees have meat and/or egg. There are a few veggie dishes, but be careful because many also contain meat and seafood. 

5/5 Value: Huge portions! Even the regular size congees ($5) are huge and meant for sharing. The supersize congees ($12) are enormous and definitely meant for 4+ people. Most menu items are around and below $10-12.

4/5 Venue: Small compared to how many customers they receive, but very clean (even the washrooms!), air conditioned, and bright. Free parking at the plaza.

Probably won't be back again since no wow-factor here."}
{"text":"The food served at this chain is pretty consistent and has become standard to what I expect in chinese food. It is simply seasoned so the taste is comforting. Each main dish has a lot of value for the price. The only pricy items would be the small side dishes.
The fried rice is nicely coated with oil and not clumpy."}
{"text":"This place is our family's go to place for asian food: my parents will drive all the way to north york from Mississauga to eat here... Wait time is never long, service is fast and efficient, the food comes fast and most of the dishes on the menu are hits. Price point is one of the lowest and the quality of the food is not comprised either.

Favourites among our family are the eel fried rice, smoked salmon fried rice, egg and beef ho fun, fried turnip cake, sizzling beef and seafood congee soup."}
{"text":"We visited Congee Wong on 02 May 2018 around 13:20.  We were able to get a table right away.  My husband ordered the Shrimp & Chive Rice Noodle Roll and I ordered the Chicken & Mushroom Rice Noodle Roll.  Wow, the filling was excellent with lots of chicken and mushrooms cramped into the noodle rolls!   It is the best I have had.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"That tall waiter with the shaved head and glasses is incredibly rude and should be fired. We specifically ordered two clay pot rice and even asked if the beef and egg one came with vegetables because my mom was quite sure all clay pot rice came with vegetables. He insisted there were none. When the two dishes came and the beef egg rice was on a plate instead, we told him about it and he had the audacity to insist that we didn't order the clay pot rice, that it was our mistake and washed his hands clean of it and stormed away! Apparently, my mom said he's always been this rude. Thankfully the owner was close by so we told him about it and he quickly rectified the situation. The food is actually okay here. Sadly, the experience was ruined by that one waiter. If you come, get the other waiters and waitresses to take your order because everyone else is much more friendly. As for that tall waiter with the shaved head, if he is so impatient and rude, he has no business in the service industry."}
{"text":"Yes you all of Congee Wong's admired. It is awesome and inexpensive. They have a nice bustling atmosphere, and a nice clean look inside. Be prepared to wait, we have not found a time when they are busy or very busy. 

They serve a great Pad Thai.....but that is not Chinese. I am also a fan of a few of their soups containing Tripe. This ingredient imparts tons of flavour along with some needed grease to a soup. As an aside for Dim Sum (in other restaurants) it comes for breakfast.

I have also sampled the pepper squid, and found it to be very excellent. In fact, for a change, order dishes which have the identifier 'pepper' in the name. This cuisine utilizes pepper in a way that is different, than westernized cuisine or cooking.

The congee is also excellent, and the service fast and pleasant, in view of the crowding. This is not a place for a romantic dinner, but it will satisfy."}
{"text":"Cantonese comfort food at its best. The seafood congee and turnip cakes are well worth the drive from downtown. I also love all their noodle dishes and their fried fish skin. There's almost always a lineup, but service is fast and efficient. Wish they would open a downtown location!"}
{"text":"Tables are not the cleanest...food was good, portions are big and it came out quickly. Staff were nice but they made us pay by cash when we well spent over their $10 credit card minimum. It was enjoyable and a great cheap bite after some shopping."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places for Cantonese chow mein and har fun.  Good wok hay.  Excellent value.  Great diner style HK dining."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to Promenade Mall for the first time yesterday. it was great! We ended up going to Congee Wong for dinner. That was not so great. 

Our waitress was nice but she did not come check up on us for the approximately 60 minutes (it was probably more) that we were there. My friend eventually flagged down another waitress to ask for our bills. When we saw our bills, we saw that a 10% service fee had been added. What the heck?! What service?! And there was no mention anywhere on the menu that the tip would automatically be added to the bill. So my friend complained to the manager and he waived the service fee. Overall he hardly spoke. 

My friend needed to pay with debit but apparently they only let you pay with debit if your order was $10 or more. The manager said there was a sign on the window stating that. When we left we looked for the sign. It was there on the window NOT beside the posted menu, not to mention if someone entered the mall from the doors near this restaurant and went right in they would not have seen it because nothing is posted on the windows on the left of the doors. 

The manager suggested that my friend pay for my food as well since that would make the total more than ten dollars and I could just pay him back but my friend didn't have enough money in his account and I only had enough cash for my purchase. It was either they let him pay with his debit or he doesn't pay at all. The manager told my friend to go pay at the desk. He looked very stern at this point. What did he have to be upset about?!

I will never eat at another Congee restaurant again. DO NOT EAT HERE!!!"}
{"text":"This place is alright. I never wish to come here on my own free will. I only ever come if my parents decide to. Generally, the food is meh. I feel like they have their on and off days (off days being more of a frequent thing). Sometimes it tastes okay and sometimes it straight up tastes like trash. Also whatever the fk they're using to wash their dishes with...IT BE HELLA STRONG LIKE the food literally just tastes like dishwater and soap like .... bruh I did not pay no god damn $15 for dishwater-tasting rice.  This is a special I never asked for. 

Their service is quite questionable. To be honest, a majority of the servers are super inattentive. You tell or ask them for something, they forgot and so you end up having to awkwardly ask them again. Also, one of the dudes made me feel quite uncomfortable cause he stared at me only ... even when my parents were talking to him, he was only staring at me .. like pls stop i don't need this much or this kind of attention LOOL 

I think they added a few new items to their menu and I would like to advise everyone to stay away from their \"ramen\". I got sucked in thinking \"OH, MAYBE ITS LIKE JAPANESE RAMEN. - WRONG YOU DINGUS. YOU IS AT A CHINESE RESTAURANT. THE RAMEN IS GON BE CHINESE STYLE!!! -\" So yeah I got the special I believe and legit it's like this thick noodle with cha siu and stuff like that like ...?!?!???? Flavour was weird and hella sweet. 

Anyways yeah meh place for Chinese food. This cannot and will not replace the Congee Wong at First Markham Place :'("}
{"text":"We ordered all greasy stuff so that may be the real problem. Except for fish maw soup which was the best thing I had that night. The others included fried tentacles, chow mein, sweet and sour chicken, deep friend pork chop - was just aiight. We even got some fried doughnut things to dip into soup. Those were pretty good!

The service was tolerable - fairly efficient but bordered on rude if I didn't write it off to a culture thing. Would not choose to go here again - I was visiting family and just followed their suggestion and ordering."}
{"text":"I live really close to this restaurant so my family ate there pretty frequently. The food is fantastic and authentic. The staff are reasonably attentive, although it can get pretty busy. Expect to wait if you arrive around dinner or lunch. This is a place that students often will go to for a midnight snack.

Typically, our family of four will get two congees, an eel fried rice, sometimes a stone bowl-cooked rice dish, and two stir-fry vegetable dishes."}
{"text":"This restaurant is one reason why the Chinese food in Toronto is a lot better than the Chinese food in Boston. I have been to this casual restaurant a few times every time I visit the Toronto area with my family. It is always crowded, especially during the lunch period, and we always had to wait at least 10 minutes for a table, indicating that it is a popular restaurant. It has a great selection of simple Cantonese-style Chinese dishes: juk (I have never called it congee until I came to university), noodles, and rice plates. 

They have this giant bowl of seafood congee that was really good, and it is big enough to make it a meal for four people. Their super bowl congees are usually less than $10 CAD, so they are definitely cheap and the best value if you have more than four people. 

As for the noodle and rice dishes, the Gon Chao Ngau Ho (Dry Fried Beef Chow Foon) was really good. It was prepared in a unique way (with some sesame) but it was really good. The chicken Chao mian (fried noodles) with Chinese vegetables and fried rice dishes were so good as well. The portions are excellent, and large enough to feed two to four people as well. 

I would definitely recommend this restaurant. It's at a pretty accessible location, near Finch and Leslie, which are two of the major streets in North York. Bring a group of people, and I think you will have a great time enjoying the food. It's very good and cheap and well worth the wait if there is a line. Although it appears to be a simple and very casual Chinese restaurant, this place has probably the best juk, noodles, and rice dishes I have eaten in Toronto so far."}
{"text":"Freakin awesome jook with the bombest hot sauce. I bought two plastic to-go containers with me of the spicy garlicky goodness to take home.

The yau ja gwai Chinese doughnut was nice and warm and was the perfect compliment to an amazing bowl of preserved egg and pork porridge. It put me in a warm happy place despite it being about 30 degrees outside.

Order the Turnip/daikon cake stir fry egg thingy too..amazing.

Prices are right and the food is homey and comforting.

{"text":"Congee Wong used to be top favourite when it comes to family / friend outings, but the food quality has really took a dip in the recent years. 

The restaurant can get quite packed on a weekend, and with
There are several tables near the back that are quite close to the washroom, and the washroom itself isn't exactly the cleanest.

Food-wise, Congee Wong was the first to introduce their famous Singapore turnip cake, one of my favourite dishes to order with congee. It used to my crispy and delicious, but now it lacks the lustre and taste it once had. 

Their congee on the other hand has been consistent over the years and great for sharing. The rest of the dishes are so-so to standard.

With so many other restaurants offering congee, Congee Wong has lost it's once glorious days in the top rankings in my book. 

Note: Congee Queen and Congee Wong are under the same management. Though, I would give the advantage to Congee Queen in terms of food quality, service, cleanliness, and ample restaurant space."}
{"text":"Ok this place is no joke! Be prepared during usually eating times to wait! A while even! 

The congee here is amazing! The food is super tasty and comes out so fast you wonder how many hands are back in their small kitchen! 

They even have a six grain congee with wild mushrooms! Sooooo good! 

Their noodles are to die for. Doesn't matter which ones you get, crispy, rice, thick rice... They're all amazing! 

I highly recommend making the drive out to this place. 

One of the best Chinese joints I've been to in a long time!!"}
{"text":"In search of some Chinese comfort food, thankfully at the corner of Don Mills and Finch, Congee Wong was to the rescue.
Sadly there used to be two locations in Markham that closed down, why? I am uncertain.
Just a heads-up aside from the venue, the plaza where this place is located can be chaotic in search for parking due to other restaurants and a grocery store that's always busy.
Obviously coming to COngee Wong we both decided to order their popular Chef's Big Bowl Congee which had a variety of seafood.  4.5/5 there was no shortage of seafood in this dish and in terms of portions, there's a lot to go around! 
Sticking with the game plan, you can't come to Congee Wong and NOT have their chili turnip cake, fried on the outside, but nice and warm in the inside served with some tossed spices and shrimp. 5/5  again, their portion was sufficient. 
We also added some steamed Chinese broccoli to keep things balanced and healthy. 

Overall Congee Wong wasn't a disappointment.  Their food, portions, price and location is bang on! I just wish they had their Markham locations, but this will do."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years, and its always a cozy place to visit in the midst of all the other chinese restaurants.  Their Young Chow fried rice is a safe bet, Fried Chili turnip cakes are a lovely compliment as an appetizer, and their Fish/salmon/ or seafood congee is bang for its buck! the portions and prices are competitive, and their service is great.  Not to mention I find their chinese tea is extra thirst quenching.  Makes me wonder...uh oh...MSG? lol..jks.. Their beef brisket noodle soup is a safe bet, along with their Fukin...YES...Fukin Fried rice... nonetheless always a pleasure to come and dine."}
{"text":"Everytime I visit Toronto, the first stop on my way home is Congee Wong.  

The BEST Singaporean Stir Fried Turnip Cakes (Lo Bak Gau), a bowl of delish congee, and a plate of Fried rice.  I'm set, done for the day. :P

Cheap and MASSIVE portions.  This place ALWAYS hit the spot for your HK tea cafe style needs.

Good gawd, I'm drooling now just thinking of those turnip cakes...."}
{"text":"What are they adding to my food?!

Sorry, I often get out of this place quite thirsty... and it's not because i'm not drinking water... The super long lineups doesn't help either.

On the plus side, they have large portions, but I think they've been cutting back on ingredients over the years (e.g. Yeung Chow Fried rice with less than 3 full shrimps, or Pineapple Fried rice with a few pieces of pineapple)... you get the point.

This is not my first choice out of the restaurants in the area..."}
{"text":"Great food, good service and a clean open style restaurant.   Love the place."}
{"text":"Love this place. Been going here for many years. Food is cheap but delicious. It is a bit small so can get busy on weekends."}
{"text":"This place has the best Chinese food in the area! The prices they charge and the consistency of the quality you get is definitely worth coming back again!

Although its located in a small plaza where parking can be quite frustrating sometimes especially during the weekends, the wait inside the restaurant is never too bad.

I come usually on Friday nights; if you arrive before 7pm then there should be very little to no wait time, after 7:30pm, there's a 15-20mins wait time. 

Their menu has plenty of varieties, congee, noodles, rice, soup noodles, just dishes, snacks, afternoon tea specials. Don't expect service to be good, it's just minimal but fast because of the amount of servers working. Food usually doesn't take long for it to come and portions are fairly big. We usually share 2 noodles/rice dishes plus a snack between 3 people and always leftovers. The taste, and quality is pretty consistence, but maybe sometimes here and there, the portions are a little noticeable, other than that, nothing else to really complain. The prices are average of $8-$12 per dish depending on what you order.

You can only use credit card to pay if your bill is over $20 and you have to pay at the counter. 

It's my go to place when I want something at a reasonable price, quick and tastes good."}
{"text":"Great congee (4 star), but get the traditional, not the Chiu Chow style congee (2 star).  We ate here several times, the best is the mixed seafood superbowl congee.  Wonton noodles were good, but go there for the congee.  We also had the lobster, it wasn't at all worth it as they only give you half for $17, but you get the whole head and tail (2 star).  Go figure what they do with the rest of the lobster.  I bet the chef/owner takes it home for themselves."}
{"text":"My favorite place for chilli turnip cake. They are famous for congee but the noodle, fried rice and other side dish are really worth to try. Be aware that all food come in big portion so watch out for your order quantity or get take away food home."}
{"text":"So, have always loved this place, but today they messed up our takeout order. When confronted they initially blamed us, but finally went back to the kitchen to \"fix\" it. When the order came back out, we paid and left."}
{"text":"I've been here over 10 times in 10 years, and this is because they make good Chinese food for good value! The experience I'm writing about is my first time dining here after opening a Yelp account.

In a group of 3 people we ordered 6 dishes and it came out to $13 per person (after tax and tips)! We got a bowl of congee (their signature item), fried vermicelli with meat, and 2 side dishes, and 2 deserts!! The fried stuff was a bit oilier than I'd like, but other than that everything was delicious. This is the kind of amazing food and prices you'd expect to see at a Chinese restaurant!"}
{"text":"I come here on a regular basis with my dad and my grandfather for many years now and we usually order the same few dishes listed below:

- Soft shell crab fried rice
- Seafood dried garlic fried rice
- Crab meat and fish maw soup (A small can feed around three people, four bowls each)
- Fried turnip patties
- Lobster with ginger and green onion chow mein
- Snow pea leaves with garlic sauce

While the food tastes great and the portions are quite large, it can also get a bit inconsistent each time we order it. This is especially true for the seafood dried garlic fried rice - sometimes it would have a nice flavor, sometimes it could taste like nothing. Sometimes they use green peas, sometimes they use chopped vegetables. I find that despite being more expensive, the soft shell crab fried rice is more consistent with flavor and quality. 

Overall, it's a good place to bring family members to for great Chinese food. However, don't expect it to be a hit everytime you go there."}
{"text":"Yesterday, my brother, sister-in-law, and mom brought me here for dinner after a day of site seeing.  We got here late so it wasn't busy anymore.  The servers were nice and attentive.  We got our food pretty quick and it was delicious.  If I get a chance during my stay, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"It's ok.  I came here based on the picture of the pineapple bun sandwich.  Unfortunately, it's only offered for breakfast or lunch menu.

The food here is similar to what you get at the other locations.  The drive up here was not worth it but wanted to see how it faired as there was some talk about it being \"really good\".  

Missing the taste element \"wok hay\" where the food is flavorful from the wok."}
{"text":"Really a classic Chinese food place. I have been coming to Congee Wong for over 10 years when I want to get some classic dishes. This is a great value place where you can get a good meal for a good price and still have left overs to go home with. I have even done take out from this location before. If you are looking for a meal, this is the place. If you are looking for something a bit more fancy, then you may want to look somewhere else."}
{"text":"Fast and efficient service on a late Saturday night when it was still fairly busy. There were plenty of servers which made all requests fulfilled promptly. Overall good food at reasonable prices. 

The wontons were big, loaded with shrimp (the wonton wrapper just held in the filling!) and tasty.

The fried squid tentacles were not too rubbery and good portion for 2-3 people.

Scallop and shrimp congee was good. The butterflied shrimps were big and the congee seasoned well. 

Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Out of all the Congee Wong's, this is the best because of the quality of their food and service. This restaurant demonstrates what authentic Chinese food is like but while making it original. Every time I go and eat here, it is like going back to Hong Kong again. The restaurant decor is nice and well-designed. Dishes include the: Salmon Congee, Seafood Chow Mein and many more. I would recommend this to anyone that has a taste for Authentic Chinese food."}
{"text":"Congee Wong is our new go to place when it comes to going out for lunch/dinner with my family. The tea is sweet and tasty (just right!) and food is  great. There's lots of variety on the menu and everything has tastes delicious so far. 

The servers are super efficient and friendly at the same time. I have never seen servers moving so fast. I don't mean to offend anybody when saying this but I feel one server working there is equivalent to more than two server working at other restaurants. That's how fast they are! I guess they have to move fast considering how busy the restaurant can get! However, the fact they move so fast, there tends to be some spillage but regardless, they clean up quick! 

Although, my grandmother being more traditional is upset about the new restaurant. After Regal 16 closed, she felt it should've been another dim sum restaurant. I guess this goes to show how each generation is different."}
{"text":"Arrived at 5:30pm last Sunday evening and the restaurant was already full! We had to wait a few minutes to be seated but the time went by quickly as everyone in the restaurant is very efficient and effective. We ordered the seafood supreme bowl, rice noodles, salt and pepper squid and the stir fried taro squares. Everything came quickly and the portions were large. The waiter filled our tea and removed our dishes throughout the meal. The price for each dish was very reasonable and to feed a family of 4, very cost effective. The washrooms however could have been kept tidier but then again it is was a busy night. We will definitely be back again but will make reservations for next time!"}
{"text":"I been going to this restaurant for a couple of years now. The first time I been to Congee Wong was at Finch and Leslie and I don't like their dishes probably because they have a different cooks. The promenade mall location is quite big and Their service are fast and all their dishes come out hot. The price is really good for the large portions which is a plus for me. It's gets really busy during the dinner time but we don't wait long for our table. You don't have to feel weird packing up your left over cause it's practically normal here especially everyone does it..they give you a container and a plastic bag and you ready to go. Tip: make sure you read your bills cause tips are already included."}
{"text":"Okay, the food is really good and authentic and the restaurant is clean but the service is not too great. The waitress are very arrogant and choose how much tip they want which means they won't give your change back if they think it's a good amount to them. 

I would obviously tip you, but how much I tip you is up to me and you can't take my change and decide how much you want. 
Acting like this makes people not want to tip you. 
Also, please don't glare at me for asking for my change back. 

Lastly, don't make me eat faster because you have a long line up. It is uncomfortable to be forced to scarf down food."}
{"text":"If nothing else, the quantity of food is outrageous. I remember looking over at a couple who had ordered 3 items and were finished their meal. \"Did they just take one bite of each dish?\". But the same thing happened to us. We were full, but 70% of our 3 dishes remained.

Service is fast, and sometimes includes the \"efficiently rude\" attitude that can be quite amusing at HK restaurants.

The congee was ok, but a bit too concentrated. We ordered the dried oyster and vegetable congee. It made the overall dish far too dry.

Singapore style turnip cakes were decently cooked, but heavy on the turnip, and lacking in flavour. Need some chili / salt / pepper to get it right.

Tofu and pork hotpot was good, and the portion size was amazing"}
{"text":"So many of the traditional Cantonese dishes can be found here. From congee to fried rice to braised meat to noodles and everything in between. If you are thinking of any HK dishes, you will probably find it here. 

Our family comes here for comfort food when in the area. I recently got off a loooong flight from Europe and was immediately driven here for a late dinner. Didn't have much of an appetite but once the big steaming bowl of thick congee hit the table, I could eat a couple bowls of that comforting goodness. The service is brisk and the food comes out quick (the usual HK efficiency in play). Also, they are open later into the night (1am usually) so you can rely on them to satisfy those late night cravings for carbs."}
{"text":"I was glad to have tried out this place as it satisfied my craving for congee. For $4.99 i ordered the pork congee with golden egg and it came with noodles and fritters. For breakfast, the congee was more than enough for me. I also ordered the toast with condensed milk yummy! It came with milk tea which was tad strong for me. I will definitely check their lunch offerings next time"}
{"text":"This is our go to place for Chinese food when my family visits from nyc. Decor is very nice. Very clean washrooms in comparison to other Chinese places which doesn't really say much. Service ain't great but not bad either. They won't go out of their way to greet you or make you feel warm and fuzzy but they get the job done efficiently. Had the roast pork, yang Chow fried rice, lobster, beef with cashews and seafood basket. All treated amazeballs with only one issue. The basket in seafood basket I think changed. It now has this weird texture that sticks to your teeth. Not really a pleasurable experience. However the food still tasted great. This place hasn't disappointed."}
{"text":"We come from Los Angeles and although we have lots of Asian food, there's a lack of good Cantonese congee. So we went around and had all the Congress in town. Congee Wong and Congee Queen are similar. But this place has their service and food done more efficiently. 

We had tried their House supreme, seafood supreme, multigrain, preserved egg and pork, scallop n shrimp, clams and salted egg, and house chicken congee. Also had lobster Chow mein, the fried daikon cake, boiled pork liver n kidneys, fried breads, etc 

All delicious and worth coming back for. Parking sucks though, oh wells"}
{"text":"The food is good; however, the servant is not really nice. The price of dishes is ok, the location is close to t and t supermarket."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good but not over the top. Its not that I didn't like anything, I liked everything, but pretty much everything I ordered you could get anywhere. It was my first time there and I'd likely go back for sure to try more and perhaps my rating would change. 

I love congee, always have, always will. Well, obviously by the name, there is alot of congee here and as congee goes, its pretty good. Now lots of places can make congee, after all, you just boil rice down until it turns into soup, a no brainer. However, at congee wong, it appears its all about what choices you get to add to your congee. They have a very wide selection. I ordered the bamboo and white fungus congee and it was fantastic. It needed a bit more seasoning, but they have a nice selection on the table to add. 

The portions are large here, it was just two of us, and we ordered a congee, ginger lo mein and a side dish of shrimp wontons. It was a perfect amount.  The side dishes look to be the size of a dim sum order, so you could go here just order side dishes if you are looking for more variety. They have a big menu and I will go back to order more of it and update my review. 

One thing that put me off, and it does happen to us non-asian types, is the fact they immediately placed two forks on the table the moment after we ordered. I know, I know, it happens, but honestly the wait staff can use the forces of deduction to see that we are two non-Asians, in a restaurant called, \"Congee Wong\" in an Asian strip mall. We didn't come in my accident. I know it happens. What really bugged me was that I asked the waiter what lo mien is good and he immediately pointed me to the Cantonese Lo Mein. Really, Cantonese Lo Mein is made at every Canadianised Chinese restaurant in the whole country. I was a bit offended but just a bit. I can understand they likely don't get alot of non-asian folks and he was just trying to help. 

For three dishes we paid $16 plus tip, one dish was shrimp so I'm surprised at the value. I would go again because this place is a great balance of good food for great value. Next time, I try the Duck Congee....

I'm giving Congee Wong a 4/5 because of the Congee."}
{"text":"Worst place ever. Save yourself the trouble.  Food is bad, tastes like it came from a microwave, cold in the middle. Staff are rude.

Have been eating at ravel Rd location for years. Will never go to promenade location again."}
{"text":"Good enough food, good enough pricing, okay services, outstanding portion!

These descriptions pretty much sum up my impression of this Congee Wong location.  Congee Wong is known for authentic Cantonese food that is flavourful.  I am not sure how the business management ensures taste consistency across the locations, but so far the flavour tastes relatively similar from location to location.  If you have eaten at one, you have been to them all.  This location stands out among peers with bigger portion.  A Sweet and Sour Pork entree ($7.50) is 20% more than what I have gotten at other locations.  The Spicy Clam Stir Fry was a small mountain.  The Scallops Stir Fry with Vegetables ($17.50) had a lot of scallops and vegetable.  The scallops were not fresh, though they had not gone bad yet.  I would not order this entree again.

Services were good.  They refilled tea pots and took away empty plates promptly.  The only irritant was they mixed up the orders among tables.  We were asked at least 3 times if some dishes were ours.  I was sure they almost handed our orders to another table.

I will come back to eat more.  I can't pass up a dinner deal like this."}
{"text":"I was happy at the beginning of the meal.  This was because there were 2 menus.  There were many good choices.  We were also given a picture book to show how certain entrees looked like.  The food arrived fast.  The food was as delicious and well portioned as the Congee Wong in Richmond Hill, which we patronize frequently.

It went downhill after meal.  We became very sleepy.  It wasn't because we were too full or had eaten too much rice (only half a bowl for each person).  It wasn't food poisoning, as none of us experienced diarrhea.  I don't know what it was.  I have never experienced this after eating at the Richmond Hill location.  I like Congee Wong a lot, but I would stick with the RH location after this experience."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery which was timely. I ordered chicken and shrimp fried rice along withe Schezwan chicken. It was just ok. It wasn't very flavorful. The portions were a pretty good size.  If I am in a pinch for Chinese I'd give it another try but I found the food average."}
{"text":"This location of Congee Wong is located in an asian strip mall called First Markham Place. There are several other chinese restaurants and shops on the strip. My first impression of Congee Wong was it was just alright. For some reason, maybe because I was really hyped after hearing the good reviews or after a long day of driving I had extremely high expectations. We had ordered the popular Fried Chili Turnip Patties, Spice & Pepper Salt Squid, Cantonese Chow Mein and Fish & Preserved Egg Congee. 

I would have to say the Fried Chili Turnip Patties is the best dish. The prices are cheap and the portion sizes are huge so we had plenty to take back to the hotel. We had enough leftovers to eat two more meals!! 

Oddly enough, the leftovers actually tasted better the next day. I'm not sure how to describe it except that the dishes seems to have more flavor like the ingredients soaked in more. I was able to enjoy late night chinese in the comfort of my hotel room so I'm giving it a 4 star!"}
{"text":"My go to place for Chinese comfort food.

Be careful on the bill as they sometimes automatically charge tip.

Food is decent, good selection, well priced and consistent service that typical of a Chinese restaurant.

Great place to stop in to eat while shopping"}
{"text":"Congee Wong!  I don't know how you do it!  Your Congee/Jook is amazing good and so comforting at the right consistency and so smooth tasting!  I haven't been here in 6 yrs but it is as good as the 1st day I visited more than 10 yrs ago!   It's good to know that your food hasn't changed.  If you want amazing congee and HK style wonton noodle soup, look no futher than Congee Wong!"}
{"text":"This place is hands down my favourite when it comes to eating Chinese food: it's fast, it's cheap and it's good. There are so many options, that it doesn't matter what you're feeling for and who you're with, there will be something on the menu that will satisfy most tastebuds. My personal favourite: their Yeung Chow fried rice. I've tried this fried rice many a place, and there is nowhere better than here. Seriously.
As mentioned by nearly everyone else, the line gets long during lunch, especially on weekends, so either time your meal well or get ready to wait (but it'll be worth it, so just sit tight!)"}
{"text":"Got the fried chow mien with seafood and congee with beef. No complaints. Tasted good but the place is a bit out-dated and slightly dirty. Would rather go to Congee Queen for the same type of food with better decor."}
{"text":"This is my go-to Chinese restaurant in Toronto. Super casual vibe, family-oriented, and most importantly, cheap! My absolute favourite is the turnip patties; I order them every time I visit. Honourable mentions include the spicy squid, seafood super bowl congee, and Fukien-style fried rice. Portions are enormous and service is efficient. Just like you would in a diner, don't expect service to be intimate like you're dining at the Keg. However, if you're not Chinese-speaking, they do take their time to communicate with you. No worries on that front.

My only negative comment would be the grease. Like a greasy spoon, Congee Wong may not be the healthiest of choices. You can definitely find healthier options, but I'd never give up a chance for turnip patties... Go big or go home. Enjoy, I highly recommend this longtime neighbourhood gem!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite place for authentic Chinese food that's family style (sharing food).  The food is delicious but the service isn't the greatest. The portions are huge. I always ends up with leftovers. For the price, it's totally worth it. 

Some of the staff don't speak English well, so they would mess up the order when we ask for modifications."}
{"text":"Solid Congee + fried doughs (all 3 types),   so-so on the fried noodle dishes.  Prices are reasonable as per most asian places in the area.  Def. a good stop for late night snacking."}
{"text":"Congee Wong is located right next to T&T Supermarket, so we decided to stop by for something casual. No frills would be a good way to describe the restaurant, but the food is decent, with very large portions. We ended up ordering:

Seafood congee: don't know why, but we thought we needed a large size. Decent congee, but overwhelmingly big.

Wonton noodle soup: 5 large wontons with noodle. This was a decent-sized portion as well

You tiao: just ok

For the amount of food that you get, the prices are very reasonable. This would be a good place to stop for some food after shopping for groceries next door."}
{"text":"This is an old standby near our home. Good, cheap, fast comfort food. Expect no frills and borderline washroom. I sometimes order takeout from the back and wander about the mall for 10 minutes while they prepare it.

Tonight we went with a few favourites:
Deep fried salty squid
Bbq pork rice noodle roll
Ying yang rice

I am stuffed and we have leftovers to take home. Under $30 taxes in. In and out in 45 minutes - they were a bit slower than usual tonight. ;)"}
{"text":"Usually when I visit New Kennedy Square, my regular places to eat are New City, Blue Ocean, and Keung's. I tend to not go to Congee Wong much, but with New City closed, Keung's being busy, and me going to Blue Ocean a lot lately, I decided to come here for lunch.

I know Congee Wong is famous for their turnip cake, so I made that a priority in my orders. I also ordered the congee tea time special, which came with rice noodle rolls, as well as seafood fried noodle which we were planning to take away.

The turnip cake definitely lived up to my expectations. At first I thought the presentation was a little lucklustre, but the taste definitely made up for it. The congee was decent, but the rice noodle rolls felt too bland and watery, even with the soy sauce. Finally, the seafood fried noodle had too much water/oil sunk to the bottom, but once we had a take-out container we were able to get most of the water/oil out and it wasn't too bad.

Service was okay. I wish they explained the specials a little more thoroughly, but I guess that's too much to expect from a Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Decent food and extremely rude service. Three of us were calling the server who was barely six feet away and he completely ignored us. He just nodded his head and didn't even acknowledge us. They also expect you to tip 15% regardless of the bad service. The food is not worth the shit service you get. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"My husband and I are regulars here and it's generally our go to for Cantonese Chow Mein, Fried Turnip cake (?), and an assortment of cravings.  I'm sure there are better and worse establishments but what I really love is the ability to call my order in ahead and just drive up for pickup."}
{"text":"Two words \"Cantonese Chow Mein\"... ok 3. 

Fried noodles with wonderful veggies, seafood, and sauce.  Chewy to perfection.  Served separately for takeout so that when you combine it - its just right. 5 stars!

We also ordered several other dishes from them.  The only dish that was not well received was the Singaporean rice noodles.  The other dishes were mediocre but I think its also that we did not know WHAT to order.  

I would definitely go here again.  I would definitely get recommendations on what to order.  The food service is fast and efficient."}
{"text":"The hot and sour soup was very flavourable with lots of stuff inside not just tofu 


Chow mien was a huge serving lots of flavour and toppings"}
{"text":"Truly great stand alone congee! Got the sliced fish with pork liver. Best comfort food around. Worth the 583 mile drive."}
{"text":"We had clam congee and Lobster noodle. The thickening agent of the congee is not to my liking but the clams are very fresh and good quality. Well I really miss back home they make congee to order and wait for at least half an hour for it super fresh, whereas here they do large volume and all the congee are prepared and just add on some ingredients to order. Well I should not have so high expectation and if want fresh better make at home hahaha. The seafood are fairly fresh but Im not a fan of the drenched sauce and the lobster was covered with starchy and chewy greasy tempura bits which I always hate. Portion is huge and price is good."}
{"text":"Wow, this place was amazing! I keep hearing about Toronto having the best Chinese food and they weren't lying! When I told my friends back in DC of places I went, THEY knew about the place!

At first, on the drive up everyone in the car kept talking about going to \"Jook Wong\"  and I'm thinking... \"What the heck is so great about some congee? It's just some rice?\"

And after my experience, I'm confident enough to give it 5 stars! The food was prompt and delicious. The service was really good (and the waitress use their own form of sign language to communicate with one another rather than shouting across the restaurant) and they were so helpful in getting my boyfriend's grandparents situated at the table with their wheelchairs. The place was clean and lastly, the meal was inexpensive!

We didn't have to wait long for a table which was surprising for it being the holiday season and the fact that it wasn't a large restaurant, just a large room. We ordered two bowls of congee (seafood and fish) and several Chinese dishes... one of which is my new favorite: special fried turnip cake. HEAVEN IN MY MOUTH!

We had 12 people for lunch and we spent less than $70. Are you serious?

To top it off, attached to this restaurant is this large Chinese market and mall. Unbelievable! Next time I am in Toronto I will definitely be ranting and raving in the car about \"jook wong.\" :)"}
{"text":"This used to be my favourite location for the chains of congee restaurants, but it seems the food quality has gone from great to just very good. Their other location at hwy 7 and 404 gets tops marks now.

Still, this has the same great menu (very extensive) with large portions for good prices."}
{"text":"Left here having mixed feelings. We dropped by at 8pm on a Saturday evening and the restaurant was crowded. Although the restaurant was bustling, we waited for only about 10 minutes before we got a table for 2. It was nice to see that the restaurant let parties of 2 sit in booths that easily sat 4. Most smaller parties sat to the corners, while the larger parties sat in the middle of the restaurant. 

We were pretty much salivating at what we saw at the larger tables, so our expectations rose with every passing minute! All of the larger party tables had typical shared family style entrees on their tables. Unfortunately, since we were only 2 people, we couldn't order the breadth of what those large parties had on their tables, but we went with the item we saw the most on yelp, the Lobster with Ginger & Green Onion Chow Mein! We also ordered a side of Chinese Broccoli as well.

To sum it up, the Lobster Chow Mein was disappointing. All of the disappointment was attributed to the fact that the noodle was too soft and chewy.  It was an obvious sign that the Chow Mein was not fried enough. Good Chow Meins consist of crispy fried noodles and this had none of that.The lobster was good though and there was plenty of it in the order! The ginger flavor of the lobster meshed very well with the noodle, which sort of helped save the disappointing noodles. 

Some other observations we had were that, like many Chinese restaurants in North America, the service was quick and swift, but not extremely friendly. Also, the parking lot outside was pretty small, but spots opened up quickly."}
{"text":"Been coming to congee Wong for over 10 years now with my family. The congee is the best I've had tasted so far in Toronto. I always get their liver congee. The liver is so soft, it melts in ur mouth. They also have lobster and crab Chinese dishes if you have family dinners here which is nice, also at a cheap price. The portion of the food here is enormous and would definitely feed an entire family. It's always good value here and we always leave with leftover take out as well!"}
{"text":"I've been going here ever since it opened, and it's my go-to place for Chinese comfort food. Rice, noodles, congee, side dishes...it's all good here. Nothing fancy, just simple food done quick and well, in quantities that will feed a family or a really hungry single person.

- Favorite congee: crab & fish maw, or pork & preserved egg.
- Favorite noodle: beef & black bean, or shrimp in scrambled egg sauce
- Favorite rice: smoked salmon, or yin-yang rice
- Favorite side dish: snow pea greens & oyster mushrooms, spicy fried garoupa, wonton in soup, shrimp & chive rice noodle rolls

Portions are bigger in the restaurant than if you order takeout, but huge either way :)"}
{"text":"Called in for a group of 22 people 2 days in advance to celebrate my birthday. When I arrived they reserved 2 tables that are not side by side! Servers would just ignore you. Need to get their attention several times just to ask for water and utensils. Service is really bad.  I even need to stand and walk over the front just to request something. 

Food wise is normal like all the Congee Chinese food restaurant. 

Will avoid this place for big gatherings from now on... Too stressful"}
{"text":"I am not from Toronto nor do I live here. But everytime I come to visit my girlfriend, she always takes me here. It has yet to disappoint me so I figured it deserved at least one review from me.

I wish we had a restaurant like this in NYC. The food here is simply amazing and at such great value!! Their portions are huge and always very tasty. I wish I could recommend something, but I feel like everything on the menu leaves me satisfied every time. 

Their congee, fried rice, stir-fry noodles are great. Their dishes are great, everything is great. 

Wish I could be more helpful with my review...but everything here is simply great."}
{"text":"Was in the area and my parents decided to pop in here for a late lunch. Would have to say this time they were better at the service. There was a bit of a wait and super busy but we finally got a table. My mom complained she was cold (because our table was near the door) so she asked the waiter if we could move. Unfortunately he said there were people waiting so he couldn't move us. But after we ordered he came back and said we can move to a booth (nice guy). 

We decided to order the supreme super bowl congee, cantonese chow mein, three kinds stuffed vegetables (eggplant, tofu and green pepper), minced pork and dried fish green beans and fried chili turnip patties. 

The congee was good, lots of seafood variety with salmon, shrimp, crab etc. the cantonese chow mein was mediocre, it's my brothers fave so we end up ordering that but I felt the noodles were too crispy for my liking. Not enough sauce to put on the noodles. I enjoyed the fish patty stuffed peppers, green beans with the little fried fish and the turnip patties. I also had an HK milk tea which was brewed nicely. 

The food came quick, food was pretty good. I didn't see that Manager from the last crappy visit. Better service this time around from the nice waiter. Also the portions are good so we had lots of leftovers. I'm starting to become a regular here!"}
{"text":"hard to go wrong with chinese food in markham. like going for pizza in nyc or tex mex in texas. good, wide variety of congee and other dishes. very reasonably priced as well.  always did take-out so not sure how the dine-in experience is"}
{"text":"AWESOME CONGEE!! I LOVE congee, so when I saw the four out of five stars with 90+ reviews, I had to check it out. Chicken and duck congee sounded tasty, however it only came in the supersized variety. It was crazy good and unlike congee from some places that may use the parts of the chicken rejected by KFC, this place uses primo meat! The spicy calamari, which is called something else on the menu, was extremely good as well as very fair value for the dollar. To round out my experience I also had beef with vegetables which came with baby bok choy and broccoli; Singapore style vermicelli noodles with pork and shrimp and pork and shrimp fried rice.

I know, I know, I doubled down on the pork and shrimp - so shoot me! It was all very good and quite reasonable for $55. I explained to the waitress that all the food was because I'm a lazy guy who chooses not to cook, to which she replied maybe I should come to your place and cook for you. Not quite sure what to make of that, but will definitely be back for the chicken and duck congee?!"}
{"text":"I usually come here at least once during trips to Toronto. Love their congee and their fried turnip cakes.  There's usually a wait, but it's worth it.  Plus, parking can be a hassle at times."}
{"text":"Stand by my 3 star review. Great for a quick Cantonese lunch or casual dinner and okay food. Service is hit or miss depending on who you get, usually you get polite service, but occasionally you get a waiter with an attitude problem. Enjoyed congee and some of the small appetizer plates (XO rice noodle, jellyfish/pork, salt/pepper chicken wings), more so than the noodle/rice dishes. That being said, we did order the chinese broccoli stir fried with rice noodle dish twice during the week for take-out, which worked for us."}
{"text":"Pretty standard noodle, congee, fried rice fare. Outdoor chinese plaza. Nothing really memorable or outstanding about the experience."}
{"text":"For the price, Congee Wong isn't bad for lunch. And really convenient right beside T&T Supermarket within the Promenade, as only one of two table service restaurants in the mall.

I've been there twice during off times when the place is emptier, and the service leaves much to be desired. There is no coordination between servers and they frequently act as though they don't care. At my last visit, we were offered (and we rejected) plates and forks twice.

As for the food, it's exactly as described, no more and no less. I ordered something that I'd never ordered before and can only say, expect to get what you pay for. Given how not-too-clean the eating area is, I'd be afraid to see the kitchen. Tables are way too close together for comfort."}
{"text":"Another fav of my fiance's family. Their radish cake is always crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.. really on point. Not too greasy either! We always order the party entree size of this dish for holiday parties or gathering!

Never got a chance to try their congee or got to dine in in person. Next time I visit Toronto is a must!"}
{"text":"Let me preface this: I've been coming to this location since its opening. I haven't been visiting this location recently because a closer T&T location opened up. However, I was craving beef ho fen today, so I drove all the way here. I get here and notice the restaurant is completely filled, minus three of the largest circular tables. I figure I'd wait for a seat. Based on my previous experience, I would need a number for them to call when a table was ready (since SNAKES arriving after me would come swoop in for a table if I didn't grab a number before them), so I went to the hostess stand and waited a few minutes for a server to come provide a number. A waiter walks by, and I kindly ask \"Hi can I get a waiting number?\" And she...completely ignores me. Yup, that woman with a bowl cut with side swept bangs to the left with glasses. I was incredibly offended because she was literally in my face, and then walked away without acknowledging me. Needless to say, did not dine in, and won't be coming back. I wholeheartedly support the Finch and Leslie location more than this one."}
{"text":"Typical greasy chinese food. This location is incredibly fast at serving the food though, faster than the other Congee Wong locations. It's also very affordable to eat here. I always get the XO Beef Rice Noodles, and it is well seasoned, but again, greasy. It can't be helped I suppose! The dish is enough for two meals. I usually buy it for lunch and eat the leftovers for dinner. 

The receptionist doesn't really have a customer service oriented attitude, but I didn't expect so. She was quick and efficient in taking orders from both in person and on the phone. The place gets incredibly busy at night because they are open late. 

I recommend this location if you're looking for a chinese food fix. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"I stopped go to this place when I saw few flies in one of my dishes. The staffs are really rude and slow. Beside that I alway tip them 15-20% in cash no matter how I paid cash or card. I got annoying with the staffs who ask for the tip when I pay by card. I won't never come back and never recommend this place for anyone."}
{"text":"Used to be a regular customer when I was living around the area, the food still taste as good as it used to be. However I don't know if it's because of minimum wage increase, most of the dishes start from almost $14, a bowl of steam rice cost $2.75. A family of four eating four bowl of rice already cost $11, I think is a little bit pricey but I guess everywhere else the same due the wage increase."}
{"text":"Very good congee and operate late hours. You can place your order on the phone or have them deliver."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite congee places in Toronto and GTA (among Congee Queen, Congee Town, etc.). It has decent food, huge portions, fast service, opens late, servers can all speak english, and plays normal music.

Their congee is slightly on the saltier side, and food is a bit heavy. You definitely don't need to order too much - I'd say 3 dishes is more than enough for 2 people to share. I really enjoy their asian dessert as well, I always order their ginger milk pudding(?) and the white cubes(?).

There are usually a lot of people working there, so you don't need any effort to get someone's attention for more tea or the bill. It's a huge restaurant but it can get busy so call in advance if you want to go during peak hours.

It's a no brainer restaurant that I always go back to when I want congee and Chinese food."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years, since they first opened to the public. However, I have decided to write this review to highlight an awful experience I've had with them recently. So I ordered takeout by phone, just a couple of dishes, then asked for EXTRA chili oil. \"Yes ok\", she responded with a tone of irritation. Went to location to pick up, asked again to make sure she put in the god damn chili oil, she replies \"YES IT IS INSIDE THE BAG\". As I opened the bag to confirm, I see no chili oil, to nobody's surprise. Absolutely shitty service from their poor excuse of a manager who can't even fulfill a simple and harmless request. What's worse, this wasn't the first time they did this to me. This happens regularly when I place phone orders. Felt outright disrespected. The food wasn't even as good as it normally is, which makes me question why their prices have been steadily increasing over the years. 
Do not order over the phone from this place. I'm sure dine-in is fine as usual for everybody else, but just don't order takeout over phone here unless you want garbage service and attitude from their dogshit manager."}
{"text":"Get the seafood superbowl congee. Huge portions without a huge price. The fried turnip cake is pretty good as well."}
{"text":"This congee wong has chinese bbq goods. 

Good congee, the \"ja leung\" here is okay, the dough fritters are a bit soggy...they prob don't use the super fresh ones because the ones I got with the congee were very fresh. The fried rice and noodles here are great too. Turnip cakes are a must get."}
{"text":"Huge portions, tasty food! 

Very busy all the time, but food comes out fast and hot. They have other food other than congee, but their congee is good. The portions are also really big, so you really get a lot for your money.

Good place to go for communal eating (order a bunch and share among)."}
{"text":"BEWARE: HAIR AND HAIRBALLS IN YOUR FOOD. Disgusting, I found a hair ball and hair as if someone was shaving while preparing the food. DO NOT GO. Terrible customer service, during my visit before I found the hair, I asked the lady for sauce twice, she ignored me then replied with, you should've asked me when you ordered, I don't have it here you have to wait. 15 minutes later, she comes back. Absolutely the worst place to go to for a restaurant; they have the most unsanitary food and worst service. Mind you this was on a weekday and it wasn't busy. I believe the lady who said this to me was the owner, the servers are average but the lady at the cash was rude. I refuse to suppose such a disgusting and terrible establishment"}
{"text":"Am very glad I went back!  This place is back on track compared to our last visit - and we have been regulars ever since.

Their standards are good - there was a time when they slipped - but things are now the way they were (thankfully).  The congee was fantastic, the glutens and vegetable in a cast-iron hot pot - exquisite!  And the hot and sour soup very authentic with lashings of white pepper.  Also went when the restaurant wasn't too busy (Christmas Day) and the chef was really generous with proportions.  Someone was having a corn soup which looked out of this world - which will be my next choice.  This is a regular, go-to, warm and familiar place.  Nice."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Congee Wong for a long time in this Finch & Leslie location. My impression of Congee Wong's food is always 'The BEST' of all the congee restaurant.

Yet, after last night, I have to re-think about Congee Wong. We ordered typical dish like the Super surpreme bowl congee, deep fried salt and spicy pork chop, deep fried spicy and salty squid, eel fried rice, stir fried vegetable, Garoupa & fried bean curd in hot pot.

First, the seafood in the congee was extremely small and scarce. What happend? It used to be huge chunk of seafood and now we have to fish for it.

Deep fried pork chop was over fried, extremely salty and seriously I had this dish better in Congee queen than here.

Deep fried squid, omg, they just pour a whole bucket of flour dough with the squid. I was so upset because this suppose to be THE BEST. Now the best I had is the Congee queen on Lawrence location.

Eel fried rice is pretty much the same in Congee queen

Garoupa & Fried bean curd in hot pot, now that was disappointing to have fish bones in the garoupa dish. it's $13 dish and now I have to spent lots of work to spit out all those bones. The fish was also over fried. 

So disappointed, I am not going back there again."}
{"text":"I usually like eating at Congee Wong; it has been a long time favourite. I used to regularly go there with family. In general the food has a lot of bang for buck. And it's very tasty too. The congee is good! I usually get their specialty one (the seafood one). There are lots of nice seafood goodies in the congee. I also like these menu items: deep fried dough fritters, deep-fried chicken, sweet and sour pork, seafood chow mein, chef special fried rice, baby bak choi and garlic sauce.

Food is always served hot. But they always seem to bring in the dishes in odd times. They like to serve the side dishes first, and the white rice comes in maybe 15-20 minutes later.

And then there was one other time we got chased by the server for not paying a full 10% tip. I know it sounds bad to not do so... but  the service wasn't good in that particular visit. The food took a long time to get to our table, and we also kept asking the server, and he said he'd check, but never came back to follow up on it. The server didn't agree with us not paying the full tip, what can you do...? We reluctantly paid it and left.

I think the service has really affected how I view the restaurant as a whole. I don't think I'll be coming back to dine in, though. I'll just order take out from now on."}
{"text":"DO NOT bother with this place if u plan to have dinner here as it is ALAWAYS crazy packed (unless u come at odd late hours). My fam & I always order take-out to avoid the chaos & getting majorly frustrated. 

All in all... we have had great service ordering take-out. They really listen to your instruction. ie: separate the sauce from noodles, less oil, etc. The price is quite good as well. Also I have been to the Richmond Hill location & the congee at RH is not as good as the one at the Leslie location. Must be smth in the water....:) I have a lot of fav dishes from this restaurant. Seafood with dry garlic fried rice, fried rice noodle roll with x.o sauce, plain congee (yes the plain is great!), etc. Everything's always yummy!

I went here for lunch last week & was annoyed cuz they made us wait for a table even though there were a few tables/booth avail! Not sure if they are saving it for more VIP high tip paying regulars or what. I have pics to prove this :) Regardless of its idiotic wait staff, I still heart the food"}
{"text":"In my top best congee (my standard order of century egg and salt pork) I've had, and also tried a different style of turnip cake than I'm used to and loved it. Affordable prices too. We came at an odd hour between lunch and dinner, and the restaurant was empty so we got attentive service! By the time dinner rolled around though, every table was filled."}
{"text":"Congee Wong needs to open one up chain here in nyc and show congee places how it's really suppose to be done. After driving for 10 hours from nyc to toronto, this was our 2nd day restaurant that my family and I have been going for years. The food is fresh, light, non oily, and finger lickin good. This place hasn't changed. The decor is a bit older, but that does not deter people from coming here. They also take US dollars, current exchange was one for one. 

Some of the best dishes here were: 

Superior Seafood Congee bowl - has salmon, tilapia (I think), shrimp and other kinds of fishes in this delicious mouth watering congee. Even if you don't like seafood, the congee itself  is so flavorful that it'll make you convert to a seafood lover. Be warned, this bowl is HUGE! We were a group of 5, and we each had at least two bowls of that. 

Fried cruller - this is a must have when ordering congee.  How do they fry it to such golden perfection and still slightly soft all around? Lord only knows. Normally, I'm not a big fan of these but I ate two of these with my congee all by myself. Now, that tells you how god damn good it was. Especially when you dip it into the congee and then pop it into your mouth. And again, not oily at all.

Fried cruller with rice roll - yum, this was the best one out of all the rice rolls we ordered (shrimp, beef and this). Loving the peanut sauce. 

Fried Shrimp ball with crunchies - this was recommended by our waitress and apparently it's one of their most popular dishes. I can understand why. Again, I normally don't eat this, but took a bite out of my sister's shrimp ball to taste. And I must say, it's pretty darn good. The crunch around it gives it a different texture. It helps break up the consistency. The red sweet and sour sauce pairs well with these balls

Fried donut - definitely wait until the end for this little sweet delight. Although this is filling, it's definitely worth eating/trying. Think of a fried cruller but heavier and sweeter. Yum.... 

They don't take credit card so be armed with cash. Come hungry!!! 

Can't wait to go back ;) maybe next year? ROAD TRIP!!"}

Just your average congee, rice, noodles restaurant... not bad but not the best. Was visiting Richmond Hill and wanted something quick, with no lines for a Saturday Afternoon.

Food was what you would expect, but nothing special. Ordered Yin Yang fried rice (which was more Yin than Yang... sauce wasn't 50/50 ratio), but still tasted fine. Also ordered Seafood Spicy XO Noodles (which had a lot of seafood... and imitation crab).

Service: 2/5
I was seated in the far end of the restaurant, which doesn't get much attention from the staff. I was looking around for a few minutes waiting to make eye contact with a waitress. After my food arrived, I hadn't seen the waitress again until the bill was ready to be paid.

Atmosphere: 3/5
Ambiance is casual and restaurant is kept clean.

Tips & Recommendations:
-Limited parking in the plaza"}
{"text":"The BBQ pork was the standout for me. I ordered the BBQ combo with two meats and white rice, but the duck was all bones, the rice was slightly overdone and the broccoli was soggy. The spring rolls weren't great, and the potstickers were average at best. If you can't impress me with the basics, I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Are there more Asians in Toronto than the San Francisco Bay Area!?  There are a bunch of chain Chinese restaurants and this was one of them.  I love congee so much, I named my dog after it.  The congee here was good ... but if it's your namesake, shouldn't it be amazing?  But when it comes to amazing memorable dishes ... congee isn't meant to be amazing right?  It's meant to be warm, gooey and comforting (kinda like my dog).

Compared to the congee I had earlier in the day, this was pretty tasty.  The rest of the food is typical of big Chinese restaurants - not bad, fast service, efficient staff looking to serve your table so you can eat and get out.  They have beans to pick through so move it along!

Lots of big tables and located in the middle of the mall ... I bet if I lived in the area I'd come here more frequently for take out ... or to pick up congee.  Otherwise, aside from the name, there wasn't much about this place that I'll remember."}
{"text":"Congee(chicken, duck and egg Super Bowl $10) my go-to sore throat remedy. 
Very meaty and never lacking flavor like other congee places. 

Today we ended up with a $35 food trip, tips and taxes in and still lotsa take-out left.
The meal included the Super Bowl congee, half crispy chicken, chinese donut in noodle roll, deep fried shrimp dumpling! Stuffed and satisfied!!"}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with ordering some seafood congee. Whenever I go to any of these congee places, I must always taste their congee soups. I mean after all, it is in their name. 

My boyfriend and I decided to have lunch here. They have a lunch menu, in which you can order a main dish off of their specific list and it comes with a soup, veggies and a spring roll. He ordered the general Tao off the list and loved it. I'm not s fan of glazed and breaded chicken, but it wasn't too bad. I ordered a bowl of shrimp and scallop congee for both of us to share and sliced beef with bok choi. 

Both of us agreed that they make really really good congee. We basically devoured the soup. As for the beef, it was actually really tasty too. It was covered in their basic sauce, as the waitress said, and it went really well with the baby bok choi. I normally never finish anything at congee restaurants and feel terrible about it, but this time we nearly did! It is definitely a good place to have some lunch food. Plus, the waitress was really helpful and patient with us, because I could not decide what to get. She warned us that the plates were going to be big, which is to be expected, but still helpful."}
{"text":"Great chinese food. I usually don't care for congee but always manage to like the one from Congee Wong. The fried rice is perfection. Their portion is quite large, but the price is cheap. I love their deep fried squid. 

Great to go with friends/family and share the food together. Service is not great, but it's a Chinese restaurant, what can you expect?"}
{"text":"I would give this a 3.5 stars. The congee was good itself but it was lacking a little flavor. As compared to other congee places (congee queen), it wasn't as good. The food items other then the congee were okay as well although all the other dishes were so greasy! 

As for the service, it was really good! They were very friendly and nice. The food came out very fast and hot as well. 

I would probably not revisit this congee place. I may recommend to a few friends but compared to other congee places, it doesn't meet the list."}
{"text":"We returned in the summer and the same server that I complained about was still there, more subdued, not running or yelling anymore."}
{"text":"It has been many years since I have been back to Congee Wong, and I should have checked Yelp before trying returning...

What once was my favourite dish there - the spicy turnip patties, are bland and lack the garlic and spice they once had.

The mixed seafood chow mein once had plenty of scallops, shrimp and squid... tonight it had imitation crab, 3 shrimp, and 2 scallops... and the sauce was water thickened with cornstarch.

The shrimp dumpling soup was bland and the dumplings were mushy..

Sadly, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Good Congee Wong quality food, if you know what I mean.   The service was very friendly and was the only Asian restaurant open before 9am on a Sunday.   Great prices for their breakfast menu (average less than $5 per set meal that includes a drink).  \"Go to\" place for early morning quick meal."}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed this place yet after being here so many times. 

Heres what youll expect....A huge line up....(Well worth it), Cheap prices, and good food. 

The place itself is nothing to write home about. It has zero decor so dont expect a retro chic 
beauty here. 

Fried chili turnip patties are the best best best in the city and everyone of every situation in life needs to taste this bundles of spicy delicious joy.  I like the lemon chicken alot too. Huge portions. 

Service is crap like most asian places but I know when I go to asian places I'm not expecting service and neither should you."}
{"text":"Portions are huge! and prices are good for what you get. 
They have congee, chow mein, fried rice, soup and rice noodle rolls. They also have some selection of drinks and desserts. They have round tables and booths. Service is quick. This place would be great for big family gatherings. 

I have been to their Promenade Mall location and although things may have changed since my last visit, this North York location is definitely better in terms of cleanliness and service than the other location. I would try their chow mein and fried rice dishes if I come here again."}
{"text":"We've ordered from Congee Wong before, but when we ordered from them recently we noticed a couple of different things. Firstly, they are no longer using styrofoam containers for their take out but using plastic containers. That's a bonus because the plastic containers can be recycled easier than styrofoam. We ordered several dishes: Scrambled egg & shrimp, wonton lo mein, yeung chow fried rice, peking style pork & crispy chicken. Everything tasted absolutely delicious. What I like about Congee Wong's food is that it isn't greasy, they give you a good amount of food, & have reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Ok food. nothing really to write home about."}
{"text":"Not really my cup of tea but all my Asian friends love this place. I think it is a little too authentic for me."}
{"text":"Food selection and quality is OK, my family eats there from time to time. The biggest problem is the staff. They are either hard to find or just rude at times."}
{"text":"Poor quality food that is over priced. My family use to eat here when they first opened. Now when we went back to eat there today, very disappointed. Tasted like they msg'd everything."}
{"text":"All congee joints are not created equal. One of my clients suggested this place to me and I am glad I listened to him. The restaurant is easily accessible from almost anywhere in the city and there is ample lot and street parking. They have an extensive menu, with congee and other Chinese delights. Service is fast and friendly, the décor is contemporary, inviting and clean and the food here is very fresh and flavorful and the portions are generous."}
{"text":"I like me my Congee Wong. Well I used to, anyway. Food quality has gone downhill and has been that way for some time now. Rumor is that the chef left to go to Congee Queen on 404 and Steeles. Now all that is left at Congee Wong is a bunch of Sue Chefs trying desperately to please the demanding Markham Chinese food crowd.

I believe the rumor since food quality as gone off the rails a bit. Still better than Chinese food you would get down town but up north the standards are set a bit higher and you gotta up your game when it comes to this genre of cuisine.

Service is still amazing. Some may find it rude but it isn't, they just don't speak English in here so everything is very basic and straight forward. They will seat you as fast as possible and food comes even faster.

The inside is very clean. A few booths, a few small tables, and a few customary giant round tables. Interior decor isn't really memorable. I do remember some light colored wood and rice plant paintings? No matter, it's nothing spectacular inside but it is definitely not grungy or dirty. 

Overall this is a great place to eat if you are in the area and are craving some Chinese food. The prices are great and treat the wallet nice. Service is lightning quick. If you're coming from the city though, don't waste a trip to go here. Go to Congee Queen because that's where the original chef resides but you didn't hear it from me."}
{"text":"Congee Wong is a 50 cents cheaper version of Congee Queen. Their menus are almost identical in substance but the pricing differs by about 20-75 cents a dish, but unfortunately so does the quality. My favorite six grains and assorted fungus congee does not have as many of six grains as there are at Congee Queen, and I'd rather pay few cents more for my extra grains:))
The decor is also a lot simpler and more generic and the seating arrangement is not the greatest with booths lining the sides and round tables put just in front of the entrance, so new customers literally stand over the eating patrons. Other than that service is friendly and efficient, so it is ok to drop by for a late night snack or quick lunch, but my heart remains set on Congee Queen as it is really the queen of my congee."}
{"text":"Very rude lady. I asked for more hot sauce to the waiter and she is back talking so loud in Chinese from the counter. Even after my one noodle soup dish came out so late after two other people sat down after me"}
{"text":"My husband and I spent a long weekend at the Niagara Falls and decided to do a day trip to Toronto.  We decided to try Congee Wong for lunch.  This place is pretty awesome.  I've never been to a restaurant with so many choices of congee.  We picked the lean pork and preserved egg congee.  I also tried their pan fried noodle with beef.  

The congee is one of the most flavorful I've had and the beef in the noodle dish is very tender with the noodle having that smokey pan-fried flavor.  Bottomline, both are absolutely delicious.  in fact, it was so good that we decided to order some take outs and brought it back to our hotel in Niagara Falls...

The service is pretty standard for a busy Chinese restaurant (i.e. don't come looking for great service).  The servers are fast and efficient, though not the most friendly.... but, given the food quality and the pricing, it is well worth it."}
{"text":"I avoided this location for the better part of a year, owing to a previous poster's cockroach sighting. I'm not a fan of vermin. 

But time heals all wounds, as they say, and let's face it, hardcore sinophiles have few options within walking distance of the Promenade. 

So, cast iron stomach girded, I decided to pay Congee Wong a visit. 

I'm glad i did. 

Full disclosure, I haven't ordered the Congee; I usually try it when in the company of people who know what they're doing. I stick to the noodles soups, dim sum items and the occasional dish from the main menu. 

Noodle soup arrives with hot, salty broth, sweet nappa cabbage and springy egg noodles. A dash of chillis in oil provide a tasty hum, without kicking my ass. THis broth is the foundation for protein choices including succulent char sui pork, roast duck (sometimes excellently crispy, occasionally flabby-drab), and springy crisp shrimp wontons that demand at least two bites to finish. It's a total meal in a bowl. 

If you're still hungry, or want to share, spring rolls are likewise nicely crisp,.  packed with barely cooked veggies. I avoid the accompanying sweet sauce, but then I'm not big on sugar. 

Pan fried meat dumplings are a critical part of my childhood. They're bigger than the archetypal version I remember, but the skins are thin and deliciously browned, and the filling threatens to burst the suckers before they arrive in my mouth. They alone are enough. Har gow would be welcome, but in it's absence a trio of shrimp-paste stuffed veggies (eggplant, green pepper and tofu) bring a different dimension to the plate. 

I love Hot and Sour Soup. Congee Wong's is a delight; red in colour and buzzingly hot, it's loaded with the usual veggies, fungi, bean curd, generous batons of bbq pork,and popping pink shrimp. Shared along with some of the dim sum items, it's a fun lunch, Or you could opt for the DIY letuce wraps, which feature nicely-cooked chicken, crispy noodles and finely-diced veg. It's a bit tame for me, but nothing a dash of hot sauce can't fix. If I'm feeling lazy or fussy about the prospect of dropping lunch on my shirt, I just eat it straight out of the bowl. 

If that makes me Wong, I don't want to be right."}
{"text":"This is my favorite congee wong to go to. The servers are super quick and fast. The food always arrives piping hot and fresh in a couple of minutes. 

The place is huge, every time I come here, I never had to wait for a table. They have an extensive menu full with different selections to satisfy your cravings. Whether it is soup that you want, fried rice, or noodles, they got plenty of dishes to satisfy everyone at your table. 

My favorite dishes to order is the fried turnip with chili, squid tentacles, snow peas sauteed in garlic sauce, and their fat noodles stir fried with beef and XO sauce. It was just me and my mom, so we skipped out on the congee but their seafood congees are amazing! 

This place already includes tip in their bill so do not overtip.

Happy eating Yelpers!"}
{"text":"This place is okay if you are desperate for Chinese food in the neighborhood coz there really isn't any other choices in Thornhill. I normally get take out at this particular congee Wong few times a year.. and the last visit was really disappointing. Their seafood rice noodles was completely atrocious... I remember it used to be so good... the rice noodles used to be thin, transparent and chewy... seafood was nicely done and it used to be such a joy to eat it. The last time I had it was so soggy and the dish was full of msg to cover the taste of its staleness. 
I want to fully hate this place but I have this love hate relationship with it because there are no other Chinese places in the neighbourhood.  

Overall: 2/5
Value: 3/5

{"text":"Love this place! Standard Chinese food for the mass, great portions and good prices. Dishes we love here: slice fish congee with fried donuts sticks, spicey turnip, soft shell crab fried rice, salted fish fried rice. We also love to order party trays for pick up and food is prepared so fast!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints, service is quick and easy, everyone understands at least three languages (English, Mandarin, Cantonese) and the food portion sizes are excellent.  Whenever we get back from a long trip this is the first stop we go to for a nice evening meal."}
{"text":"Food is not bad and I've been going there without much problem until the most recent one when the waitress barked over we didn't tip enough. We always tip 10-20% before tax, and that time we paid almost 20%, but she complained it's not even 10%. Apparently she was looking at the after tax figure.
So long!"}
{"text":"Great place for chinese food. The congee is always good and they make it consistent. The fried dough and their fried turnup cubes are yummy. 

Their cantonese chow mein and their seafood chow mein is quite good and always a hit with my kids. 
Food comes in fast from when you order it, so be prepared as table space becomes very scarce in about 5 minutes. 

For the money, this is pretty good value. 

I like this location as I find it cleaner than the one on Hwy 7 and Woodbine."}
{"text":"First time at this location and if you been to another congee Wong location it has that same vibe. Can't really compare the vibe to a congee Queen because the environment at a congee queen is 100x better in my opinion. 

My go to dishes are squid tentacles, (can easily mess up this dish) fried turnips, and a congee with the long fried dough things. That's a key meal. More than that for 2 people is take out containers, you can end out walking out with 5 containers because the portions are pretty large. Suppose to feed like 4 people

Caution: don't order too much because it's mostly meant to be shared unless your a beast and can finish it to yourself. 

Honestly I'm giving it a 5 star because there's nothing I found wrong with this location everything was spot on, they gave the food on time, the service was on point, they brought me a coke midway and brought it fast! 

Will I come back? Most def."}
{"text":"Honestly, I have no qualms with this Congee Wong location but maybe that's because I've ordered take out every single time I've come here.

Calling in to order take out is pretty easy - they've picked up the phone every time (unlike a lot of other restaurants I've called....). It definitely saves on waiting time. It doesn't take long for them to cook all the food and I find the food arrives at the front before I get there which is nice.

The food is well seasoned for the most part. I haven't really had an overly salty or bland dish from them yet. I'm pretty sure they use MSG here but if you're that worried about it, you should just stay in the 2000's. Everything in moderation.

I recommend getting the corn and taro congee for those who aren't feeling like eating meat. Savoury. Satisfying. Really good for those who are feeling under the weather. If you aren't sick, make sure you grab some fried dough fritters with that.

One of my favourites is the fried turnip patties. Bite-sized cubes of turnips that taste and feel like mashed potatoes but better. There's some egg, shrimp, and diced chili pepper to round out the dish.

The portion sizes for most of their dishes are well worth the price that you pay for. Based on fellow Yelper reviews, perhaps order take out here first. Might save you (and them, really) from experiencing a bad first visit."}
{"text":"One of the first successful Congee franchises in the GTA, Congee Wong ruled the congee market back in the 1990's. However, it has lost much of it's consumer base within the last few years. A new ruler has usurped the throne. A millennial ruler, Congee Queen! But this is not about Congee Queen, so I'll get back on track.

Congee Wong is a Hong Kong style establishment serving Hong Kong style food. The decor is plain and the place is brightly lit. Booths occupy the perimeter and round tables occupy the center of the restaurant. The round tables are used to accommodate larger groups simply by adding foldable stools. Personally I experienced squeezing 14 people for a table normally fit for 8 comfortably (and that's their largest table). Also like HK style restaurants, their goal is high table turnover. Food comes out super fast, and there's no sequence to the order in which it comes out. If it's cooked, it's on your table, simple as that. The menu is crazy extensive, from Congee, to Noodles, to Rice, to sides and appetizers, Chef specialties, and even Dim Sum. As with all my reviews that encompass many dishes, I will group them in lists by star rating due to space constraints. Comments and notes will be curt if notable.

5 stars (Must Try/Adventurous):
H2. Soft Shell Crab Fried Rice.
E12/E30. Dry Fry Rice Noodles with Beef (or E5 w/seafood).

V42. Crispy Chicken ji

2 stars (Desperate):
P44. Deep Fried Squid with Spicy Pepper and Salt. This dish used to be 3 stars but I've since downgraded it. It's gotten real greasy.

With over 400 items, there will obviously be good and bad, and all subject to personal tastes. It'll come down to cravings really. Congee Wong has consistently provided good value over the years. If you grew up with Cantonese style food, their \"Wok Air\" will be enough to comfort you.

Despite the ever popular Congee Queen, I still prefer the Congee from Congee Wong...

If you would like to experience more, come dine-with-me.yelp.com I'd love to have your company... Bon Appétit!"}
{"text":"Of all the congee wong's this is the best location, which would explain why it is constantly packed. Surprisingly, they do take reservations for a large group of people, which is great for cheap family events. They need to open at least one up in every city in the world. 
My loves here:
- xo sauce turnip
- any fried rice
- garlic stir fried any vegetable
- plain white congee

but really, anything here is yum."}
{"text":"If one is looking for a quick meal that's healthy and decent, this place fits the bill perfectly.  Despite its fast pace, everything was very orderly, you don't get the \"rush effect\" where everyone is just relaxing and enjoying the decent food and service.  Extra kudos to the very slender robot like server who was attentive, courteous and fast on the feet/hands.  Very rare to find such good people as servers, brings a lot of energy to a place.  The Congee here is good, very solid.  The fried dough/noodle \"fun\" dishes are all good to go.  If the tea was better, it would complete the experience totally.  Bottom line, for under $10/head and be out in 20 mins or so, this is the place.  And yes, their bathroom is clean and the dining room is well maintained in a neutral tone, nothing tacky or weird w/ their design.  I have been coming here over the ten years while visiting Toronto, and the fact it still stands strong says a lot about the management and staff that make it happen here.  Congee Wong, rock on."}
{"text":"For some strange reason, I have always liked this location better than the other newer, nicer locations within this local chain.  I just find their congee more authentic and hits the spot.  Granted, they can use a facelift, but I come here strictly for their congee and I think they got the other locations beat.  The service used to be more efficient but the trend for good servers have been going downhill across many restaurants over past 5 years due to all the inflation and stress in costs of living (gas, etc).  Despite that fact, this is still a nice quick fix for under $6/7 a person."}
{"text":"Perfect congee in town, its too far for me to come here, but i really really want to go back here. The chinese donuts were crunchy, fresh and couldn't stop eating. The congee was a lot and made 3 people got full. The menu is very diversity, u will have many choices and here is a good place for family dinner."}
{"text":"As It goes with Congee Wong, this one is fine. It's when you need that Chinese food fix, or you need your HK tea, or, in my case, my entire family overslept and we're all starving and dimsum doesn't seem appealing.

Warning. Parking here on weekends in peak hours is a sh*tshow. 

Service is...hmm. Those poor servers seem to be up to their EARS in things to do. You probably won't experience rudeness, because they seem to handle their stress well enough, but prepared to see some stressed out servers.

Favourites here are the Golden Milk Pudding ($4.95), which is sprinkled with some sort of sweet sand. Also good is the fried turnips \"Lor Bak Go\", which is AWESOME when hot, but beware if you get takeout and leave it in your car by accident. Does not smell awesome them."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday night at 5pm for a quick dinner with my boyfriend. We ordered 3 things, one of which was congee. They brought out the congee first, and it was fine. But then we waited almost 20 min for the rest of our food, to the point where the guy beside us who had come in at the same time, was already done his meal. We asked a waiter how long it would be, and he said 5 minutes, then quickly changed it to 3 after he saw my boyfriends look of disappointment. 

The food, when it eventually came, was just ok. Nothing special, you could get the same quality at any of the other big chains. Prices were really high though, most things were around $14-16 for an entrée. 

When it came time to pay, the lady who brought the payment machine was super nosy and rude. She slammed down the machine on the table, and was staring at my boyfriend over his shoulder while he input his pin and tip. I decided not to tip because of the slow and rude service, and she glares at my receipt and says \"tip isn't included in this you know\". Then she walks away and glares at me across the room!

I will probably never come here again, there are plenty of Chinese restaurants in the area with better service."}
{"text":"This location started the GTA Congee Wong craze and had many an interesting nights when they still had the snake congee (now banned).  The decor survived through the years and food stayed true to form.  The new restaurant with similar name and food offering does not do justice to the similar name.  I now frequent the new location when the cravings call."}
{"text":"For a Congee Wong, this place had the best service.  Our server was a lady who came by often and asked if everything was okay and food was delicious.

Cheap and reliable, I can always count on Congee Wong for that."}
{"text":"Came during a time that was not busy at all. We ordered beef stir fried with wide noodles, boiled crab and chili turnip cakes. Everything came to the table popping hot. The cakes were much bigger than we expected, which was good. The noodles were amazing, it was my highlight of the dinner and the crab tasted pretty fresh. I gave the one star off because of the cup, it had dried up residues of food so I didn't use it."}
{"text":"Restaurant was filthy and the staff were rude. The food quality is quite poor. They have a ridiculously extensive menu. Most items fall under the congee, noodle, soup and fried rice category. The portions are very generous and prices are fairly low. If you ever thought about adding something random to your congee they will probably have it here. They have over 50 different types of congee! 

At least the hot pot of tea is complimentary. 

Cash only!"}
{"text":"This place hasn't updated their interior in 10 years because it still looks the same in not a good way. Food is average.. Pretty much has the same menu as congee queen but cannot compare the flavours and quality. I won't be coming back here, not for me."}
{"text":"Used to go to Congee Wong from way back while attending Seneca College near by.  I brought my then bf there once at time, apparently he liked it so  much that he got hooked. Also so on his sister was introduced to it. Apparently its her fav restaurant. So from this trend, we can see some good words about this restaurant has spread out. Congee Wong is on Finch n Don Mills. Considering where I am downtown core, I never had the urge to go such distance to eat Chinese food since I dont drive. But recently there two family dinners I had attended brought me back to this place after all. 

The place had never been renovated EVER! But the interior somehow was maintained nicely. it can fool you mistakenly thinking its a new restaurant . Everything looked clean fresh and organized. It does give you a bright welcoming feeling as you walk inside. I like when you walk in, you feel \"Chinese\"! A lot of Asian places try too hard to be contemporary lately and lose their own original flavor of whom they present at first place.  The restaurant was busy even at 4:30pm on Sunday.  if you want to get seats for dinner, better go before 6pm. Or you might have to wait at door for seating. 

We had pork congee, sweet n sour pork, satay chicken chaomian, sizzling beef with onion and mushroom, pork chops, chicken fried rice... very typical stuff what white people will order when they go to Asian place. All the dishes lived up to the expectations, they were very satisfying. Surprisingly the pork chops were amazing, they were lightly breaded and seasoned perfectly, thoroughly cooked and yet tender. 

We gave them huge tips, and I think I am hooked on pork chops now. I am probably going to go back there for some porc =D"}
{"text":"The service is good and the food is both good and cheap. My family usually orders the superbowl congee, fukien fried rice, chicken and salted fish fried rice, chiu chow marinated duck, garlic lobster or the fried turnip patties.
The congee is good but on busy days it's more watery so we try to go on a weekday instead of a weekend. The fukien fried rice is my favourite because I get tired of dry fried rice and this serves as a great alternative. It gets pretty busy at dinner time on the weekend, as well as holidays, the wait is never too long though."}
{"text":"I agree they are usually staffed thinly but it does not change the fact that the value for the quality and taste of the food is great! We are often the only 'white' people in the restaurant and it is quite busy most nights. Favorites for us include the szechuan beef, mango chicken and many of the fried noodle dishes."}
{"text":"I like this congee wong BECAUSE of the speedy waitress who appears as if she drinks 5 cans of redbull before every shift.  Listen, the fact of the matter is that everyone knows Chinese restaurants have TERRIBLE customer service.  That is not why you go to a Chinese restaurant, you go there because the food is good, it is cheap, and it is fast.  The speedy lady ensures that the food comes out fast.  I have no issues with her running around the restaurant.  I can deal with her running around and getting tables filled and cleaned rather than some slow ass waitress taking her sweet time checking her phone instead of getting orders out."}
{"text":"What makes this Congee Wong different than other locations??

The variety of the menu? There is a different special menu for breakfast, afternoon tea, dinner. Breakfast and afternoon menus are similar to what offers in a Hong Kong Style Cafe. And for dinner, there is option from entree menu that offers even fresh seafood from the fish tank!

I was here twice: lunch and afternoon tea since it opened and both time my experiences were A-OK. Decent food at a great price and friendly fast service!

There are also quite a few tables that are good single diner like me. 

I will be coming in for a quick bite quite often when I am in the neighbourhood which will be almost every week!"}
{"text":"Congee Wong inside the Promenade Mall might not be my usual Chinese restaurant to get my Chinese food fix. But if you are in the Bathurst area, Congee Wong will be best and even the only choice. 

The interior is really in need for some freshen up: Sticky Tables, outdated deco and filthy condiment holders....yuck! 

Prices wise Congee Wong still have the dated pricing but my Shrimp Dumpling Soup Noodle ($4.25) though reasonably priced the portion is smaller than usual...why I say that? I still hungry after I ate that.... next time I need to order a snack too! 

Service here is efficient and fast... and they seems to have a system where they have all the lone/single customers seat... right at the back of the restaurant... single hang out area??"}
{"text":"I have to say Congee Wong's food quaility really going downhill........

We were there for a quick dinner on Saturday night. The Rice Noodle Roll with XO sauce we ordered was such a joke. Tasted like something that I made (ok, that means it is quite bad :p) It is not even wok hot...and hardly any XO sauce in it. I really feel like returning it back to the kitchen.

Even the other table that ordered the famous Singapore turnip cake.. they were all kind of mushed up.

The other things we order are so so... really not impressed!

They do now have specials set lunch, afternoon tea and dinner, which seems to be good value.

However, it will take me a long time before I will be back, since there are so many choices of Congee restaurant even in the Plaza."}
{"text":"A simple little congee restaurant, not as big or nice looking as Congee Queen or even Congee Town, although this place has probably been around for a lot longer. We ordered the seafood super bowl congee and the chilli turnip patties based on Yelp reviews, and also a plate of home style fried vermicelli. The bowl of seafood congee is HUGE and there is a good amount of seafood in it: shrimp, scallop, salmon, fish, squid and crab meat. My mom and I both found the congee to be too salty though, and I have a feeling they put quite a bit of MSG in it, which I'm not a fan of. The turnip cake was actually quite good. People who enjoy spicy food might be disappointed - despite the name of the dish having \"chilli\" in it, it is not spicy at all. They were perfect for me though! Flavourful but not too much so, and slightly crispy on the edges. I thought this dish was better than the one I had at Congee Town. The home style fried vermicelli I would not recommend though. I think in general this dish is just supposed to be lighter tasting, which I understand and I guess expect. Congee Wong uses really weird noodles though, they're thicker than regular vermicelli, and although it's not bad, it's just... weird, and like more moist than I feel like the dish normally should be. Honestly, for me, Congee Wong is not somewhere I would visit again, just because I feel like there are other options for me which are cheaper for similar or even slightly better quality (i.e. less salt or MSG or whatever, although I will admit I haven't had better turnip cakes), and also nicer looking in terms of decor."}
{"text":"Ordered Preserved egg and pork congee w dough fritters and bean sprout fried noodles.  The congee and noodles are not hot enough for me.  Too bad drinks not included in the congee breakfast combo."}
{"text":"Still awesome!  If you've loved Congee Wong, this franchise is consistent with the food they've been known for.  Yea, I'm talkin'  about excellent chinese food served hot and tasty.

The interior might surprise you a bit with that refreshing modern flair - more classy I would say, with some ambient lighting.  Service still speedy as as racing car with optimum efficiency and friendly as a favorite cousin...or aunt...or uncle...or what have you. :D  More seating capacity with many rows of diner style nooks/booths.

Parking may get a little challenging since the complex is not as big and with too many businesses on it.  Should you get frustrated, there's the residential street parking in Bayview Hill.  

So glad they finally landed in my neighborhood.  Now, my too-lazy-to-cook lunch or dinner will be more conveniently justified or the huge craving for that awesome congee bowl in any Fall or Winter day will surely be satisfied.

They just have to figure out how to upgrade some of their dishes a bit in comparison to the other places I've been to so I can give them the 5 star rating.  Anyhow, I'm a happy & satisfied customer.

Oh btw, as of this writing, they're not online yet so have CASH to pay. ;)"}
{"text":"This is my first time here (and first time to a Congee Wong restaurant), so I can't really say if this restaurant is going downhill like some of the other reviewers.

The food is good and the prices are very reasonable.
I was here with a couple friends from out of town and we each ordered a bowl of congee along with a few side dishes. 
Don't be fooled about the prices, these bowls of congee are huge. For $4 I assumed they were a small individual size bowl, but one bowl could've been enough for 3 or 4, and was served with a large ladle so you can share..

One thing I would have to agree with the other reviewers is that their famous chili stir-fried turnip cake was just okay. I took some leftovers home and my mother tried it and said it wasn't as good as it was before.  It just needs a little more spicyness and pan fried a little longer to have that nice char and crust to it (it was a little on the mushy side). 

The braised mushrooms on a bed broccoli was very good, and had a nice mix of various mushrooms (I especially like the shiitake and straw mushrooms).

I would go again as it's still a good place for a cheap and tasty lunch.
Be warned, the parking lot at this plaza gets extremely congested, especially on a weekend and during lunch, so give yourself enough time to find parking."}
{"text":"For taste only, Congee Wong earns 3 stars. If you care about the portion and value, it sits right at 3.5 stars.  

The reason portion earns half a point, because my BF and I both could only finish half a plate of noodle.  There were 2 large boxes of leftover for lunches the next day.  In terms of deliciousness, the 2 orders of noodles tasted okay if a bit salty for some.  But I like saltiness.  The services were effective, with the typical lack of enthusiasm among Chinese restaurants.

Hence, Congee Wong is the place for a good deal for lunches and dinner, especially for families and groups.  Everything tastes okay, nothing tastes surprising good or bad, and the wallet does not hurt.

Last words, if the food tastes better, taking portion and value into consideration, I'd have rated it 4 stars.  I sincerely am looking forward to improvement."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if they've changed around the cooking staff but the food has gotten better! The portions are still large as well and the service still extremely fast. Some good bets: yeung chow fried rice, house seafood and mixed vegetable fried rice, and seafood super bowl congee."}
{"text":"Was here just a few days ago and have been here many times but last time was s*** service the server was extremely lazy and rude. After we seated ourselves the server brought us our plates and silverware she just placed it on our table didn't even put it out for us also didn't even ask if we wanted anything to drink.

We ordered about 4 items which all came out fast but close to the end when we finished our fried rice she just came back and took the plate away yet we weren't even finished EXTREMELY RUDE

You're management people need to fire her or she needs to be retrained 

Never coming back to this s*** hole don't even bother

Food was good,came out fast it's just the customer service needs ALOT to work on"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. I only gave one star, because that's the lowest. However, their food was okay. The waiter kept rushing us to eat, which was disgusting. On top of that we paid her and she came back and she's like \"you know this bill didn't include tips\" like why are you asking for money? We gave her tips on top of what we paid and gave her. Anyways she got some more tips. On top of that she gave us no water and we had to ask another waiter. HORRIBLE customer service, would NEVER go back!!"}
{"text":"We came here to satiate a congee craving and we weren't disappointed. The interior was nice and clean, modern-looking. We ordered a couple of dishes with the expectation that we would bring the rest home for leftovers. We ordered the seafood congee, the snow pea tips, and stir fried rice noodles with beef. The congee itself was very tasty and one of the better congees I've had. I was a little disappointed with the snow pea tips as I've had much better, and the rice noodles were just okay. All in all, the congee is worth it, but there are better places for Chinese food in the GTA."}
{"text":"LOL.

Actually, the food isn't half bad here. It's edible. 

Service is a joke though. It's not uncommon for kitchens to miss an order. Or to ask a server to follow up on missing plates. 

However, it's not cool to make customers wait for an hour between following up with two different servers, bill customers for food they didn't receive and even worse, chase a customer outside because there was no tip included.

Bitch, you ain't getting a tip for that shitty ass service. That's not how tipping works so read a book. 

Bye Felicia."}
{"text":"This is a standard chinese restaurant. Don't expect fancy decoration or amazing service then you won't be disappoointed. They have a wide selection of food to choose from; quality is quite consistent. Food sually arrives quickly after ordered which is a big bonus. 

They have set menus for groups that is well priced and good selection. Last weekend our family got the set menu with 10 dishes for 10 people for around $200; it was pretty good for the price. The set menu came with wide range of dishes (chicken, pork, fish, lobsters, veggies) and generous portions that were more than enough for everyone. 

They have very cheap breakfast and afternoon tea (3-5pm) on weekdays.

Overall, consistent and reliable quality of food, fast and efficient service."}
{"text":"Food is consistent and decent portion size. This restaurant (like many popular Chinese restaurants) had huge line ups during lunch and dinner rush.
Food arrives super fast and satisfied my hunger. 
I like the garlic seafood fried rice, turnip cakes, and superbowl congee"}
{"text":"Quick eats for a wonton noodle soup.

Expect your standard Congee Wong/Time/King decor, menu and staff.

My wonton noodle soup was good, good broth, chewy noodles and shrimpfull wontons.
My friend has the dumpling soup as I described above but with dumplings.

The service was less than ok, the food took a little longer than normal to get to us.  We didn't have condiments at our table and the waiter forgot to bring when we asked for them.  We were there near closing but not even half way through our meal our bill was presented to us.  I know what to expect service level-wise but quick service is something that goes without speaking.  With that said remember to bring what I asked for and let me finish my meal.

I'd go again but will only expect decent food with a side of laxo daisy service."}
{"text":"Sadly, this location is the definition of mediocre. Ordered the congee and fried turnip cake. :p"}
{"text":"Do not know what to say. Congee Wong has good food. I have no complaints really. It is crowded so you can expect to wait in line a lot of the time. Come in a small group for fast seating and to order many dishes. Staff are friendly, but you will struggle a little to get their attention. But that's okay..it is typical of a Chinese restaurant! Makes it somewhat authentic as Yoga S. has posted. =D"}
{"text":"Service and Attitude is extremely bad. When we ask to change the order right after 10 \"second\" we order the food, their attitude is like they don't want you to change it and scold at you. Thats the lady who standing at the cashier. Bad experience !"}
{"text":"I draw the line when staff request more tips. After a rather mediocre service experience on both occasions (e.g. hot tea pot wasn't refilled, just dropping plates wherever there was room on the table, etc.) a rather average tip was given. To my surprise the waitress demanded I put more tips, even though I wasn't the person who paid. This has happened on two occasions. I won't be back."}
{"text":"when this place first opened, they had the best congee and the best singaporean-style \"lor bak go\" (pan-fried diced up turnip cake). it was pre-911 back then, and i always insisted to get a take-out order to take home w/me, on the plane. it was THAT good.

my memories still linger, so every time i visit toronto i ask to go there again. but, years later, i was told that their \"lor bak go\" isn't as good as before, and the place gets very busy (i.e. less service). and it is true. one time, my take-home order looked nothing like \"singaporean style\": it had a slightly orange color in the sauce, and no crunchy pickled veggie found. the cake itself was a bit slurpy. it was just very out of range and disappointing.

even so, their other food items (ex. congee, noodles & rice) are of good quality. i remember them having these large-bowl orders of congee that cost what feels like $20+ per bowl, for at least 3-4 people to share. probably cost less than a small bowl, but, who doesn't want their own bowl of congee w/their own favorite ingredients in it? 

bc i mainly go there for their \"lor bak go\", naturally i started to go much less since this signature dish of theirs (at least to me) doesn't taste the same anymore. regardless of that, last time i visited toronto w/friends (in nov 08), i still tried to introduce them to the good food there, but who knows they're not open until 9/9:30am or later?  for a congee (breakfast) place????  business must be good for them.  and it probably is, seeing all the people lined up at the door at peak hours. don't know if they take reservations, but if you have a larger party (say, 6+), you may want to try making a rsvn, or be prepared to wait for quite some time.

price-wise, it really depends on what you eat. you can probably fare under $10 (or around, after taxes) with a mere order of congee/noodle/rich dish, maybe plus a shared side dish with a partner. but chinese food is all about ordering a few things to share, so by average, around $15/pax is just about right."}
{"text":"arrived toronto last week late at night (say, 2am?), desperately looking for something to eat.  carried on by its fame and my nostalgia for them, i opted to get some take-out from congee wong out of the few other places that were still open in the same plaza at wee hours. 

got 3 things: \"nor mei fan\" (sticky rice w/preserved meat), singaporean style \"lor bak go\" (pan-fried turnip cake w/crunchy pickled veggie), soy sauce \"cheung fun\" (rice rolls covered--but not soaked--in soy, accompanied w/hoisin + sesame dipping sauce). 

at the first bite, was still a bit \"disappointed\" by the lor bak go, as i did remember it being much flavorful than this. but after a few bites, it was growing on me and i would still pick on it most out of the three, though my bf liked his nor mei fan best. the sticky rice was wrapped in foil inside the take-out box; it was flavorful and still with the right softness--not like it was left there to dry for long. the soy sauce cheung fun appeared freshly made; definitely not some reheated leftover stuff. given that we ordered our food right before closing, they were of great quality, which can only result from uncompromising culinary spirits from the kitchen.

they did forget to insert forks/chopsticks into our bag, though. almost had to eat with our hands (lol)! aside for this little hiccup, service was great and the waitresses were polite. they took our order even though we walked in 1 minute before closing (there was still a table of customers who hadn't left), and the cashier (boss?) was patient while we took time to pick something out of their extensive menu. no hard feelings/attitude were given whatsoever, so kudos (+1 star) to them for superb customer service."}
{"text":"Price per person: around $10
Summary: a cheap and tasty congee place
Tip: call to book a table, this place gets pretty busy during weekend

This is a typical good congee place in Toronto. It is pretty much like Congee Queen. We came in a large group. We ordered many dishes, but shared, which ended up to be around $10 per person."}
{"text":"A lot of variety of chinese comfort food; rice, noodle, HK style snacks etc.  The prices are affordable and the portions are big.  Definitely try their congee which is what they're famous for."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for a long time. Food is alway great! The lobster chow main is the best."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed Congee Wong:
1.  Free parking.
2.  Clean environment.
3.  Decent decor - simple and pleasing to the eye.
4.  Busy place but servers were fast in their service.
5.  There was a pictorial menu so you could point and order.
6.  Time for food to get to the table after ordering was like a blink of an eye!
7.  Dishes were tasty.  No complaints.
8.  Favourite dish = sweet and sour shrimp & pork with mango and pineapple.
9.  Price range was ok.  We ordered 4 dishes, and each person paid about $11.
10.  You can pay with your plastic $$"}
{"text":"This place was OK before, but now the service is really really bad. 
Last Friday, the owner or manager at the cashier asked the customers to leave more tips because they've userd the power to change their phones. Not a good experience 
This is just one example."}
{"text":"Have been going here with my family for years - the food is cheap, plentiful, and includes all the usual Chinese stand-bys. It's right by T&T for that much needed after-dinner digestive walk with your visiting Asian grandparents.

Funnily enough, the 'House Chicken' is literally never available - try asking for it; they'll inevitably have it 'unavailable'. Get the 'fried dough fritters' - it's a pretty delicious appetizer for less than four bucks, and comes with a bunch of dipping sauces."}
{"text":"Delicious congee, noodle and Turnip patties; reasonable price; clean and bright environment. What more can I ask for?"}
{"text":"If you are looking for fine dining, superb service, and attention to dining detail, you did not come to the right place. You need to set your expectations to what they are offering and not what you expect - especially at a value conscious restaurant.
This is our go to place for Chinese food. They serve delicious fare at a fair price. The portions are good, the food is fresh, and service is quick.
We've been quite a few times and the wait staff already knows that we like to have dining plates and hot sauce - they bring it to us even before we order. They even know we are a weeknight dinner family.
Normal dinner is some veggies, soups, noodle soups and a couple of meat dishes. Sometimes, we get the spicy squid or something sizzling. Whatever we choose, we leave satisfied and without a hole burnt through the old wallet.
Oh...yeah...the congee is pretty good too."}
{"text":"Lots of great Chinese food in GTA and Congee Wong is no exception.  It can get pretty crowded and there might be a bit of a wait but this place is well worth it.  Obviously you must get the congee.  I love that you can get a huge bowl or a smaller bowl depending on the size of your party.  Another must is the chili pan fried turnip which is amazing and comes with some shrimp and scallops.  It has a slight hint of chili but not too much which is perfect for the little kiddies in my party.  Oh how I miss TO."}
{"text":"I have to agree with the other foodie reviewers that this place is clean, service is attentive and quick. They make the Cantonese Chow Mien to my liking. Crispy noodle with just the right amount of sauce - not soggy. I also like how they make their spicy garlic pepper prawn pan fried with the skin on - very tasty. The portion sizes are large, and good value for the money."}
