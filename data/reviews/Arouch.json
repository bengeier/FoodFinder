{"text":"Love this place ~ checks all the boxes for me

Atmosphere: Clean, clean, and even more clean.  Located in the lobby of the JMBS Concordia building, this place is buzzing with a young crowd and they do a tremendous job at making the place look like it's the stopping ground of the PhDs in stead.

Service: Behind the counter top fo the line service - kind, courteous, and engaging - the people working here are great.  It has been recently sold to new owners - hope the good culture here continues!

Food: DEE-Lish!  and very very simple - Armenian / Middle Easter fare like Mana'eesh and Lahamajoon - they're not made on site but are warmed up and prettied up for you with various garnitures at request.  The menu is small enough that you'll not be confused or troubled with the order

Great place to grab lunch or a mid-day snack.  Classy and well kept - it's what keeps people coming back here.

Happy munching!"}
{"text":"I stayed in a hotel near Arouch. I decided to stop by and give it a try and the bread was delicious and crisp with a tasty spice to it! I would definitely recommend this place to a friend."}
{"text":"Being Armenian you try and seek out places that are owned/operated/serve Armenian food and Arouch is one of those places.  I come here often for a quick bite for lunch since its close to my work.  They have, of course, Lahmajoun, Greek, Aleppo, Zahtar, and Anatolian (cheese) pizzas. I have tried all their offerings and they are all great.  You can add toppings to any of your choices.  My personal favorite is the spicy lahmajoun with a squirt of lemon.  It just enhances the meal and in my opinion requires no extra toppings.

They also sell candy from Yerevan (Grand Candy).  I would recommend trying a couple of pieces because its actually really good."}
{"text":"The food here is beyond great. The staff is polite. Very clean place with good prices. Definitely worth it to come here."}
{"text":"This Arouch is in the JMSB building in Concordia... and is full of students running to and from classes.  They offer a variety of pitas (I usually get zatar -  a mix of thyme, oregano, sesame and other spices), with or without additional cheese. They heat up the pita, then take it out to top with your choice of toppings, including  lettuce, tomatoes, hot peppers, mint,  pickled turnips (which I LOVE), olives.. etc.  It's $0.40 per topping and around $3-ish for the basic pita (if my memory serves me correctly..) 
The pita is rolled up into a nice portable sandwich perfect for eating on the run."}
{"text":"This place is so delicious. Its like a shwarma meets subway. 

I had a regular lahmajoun with tomatoes and tabouli. My boyfriend had soujouk hot peppers and pickles. Both were crisp on the outside and filled with yummy goodness. 

Great light lunch for 2 people for less than $20,00."}
{"text":"Heh, this place is great!

I got a whole box Lahmajouns and they tasted amazing, from the first bite until the last. They are basically thin pita bread with a good amount of meat sauce spread on top and reheated in the oven until the edge is crispy.

A typical meal here is very inexpensive and ideal for lunch, short waiting time, and could be healthy if you add some veggies and other condiments.

I didn't go for any toppings, as I found the Lahmajoun to be perfect just by itself.

The location is great, literally under John Molson building and close to the metro. I have yet to try other kinds if pizza but I'm eager to come back for some more!"}
{"text":"My friend introduced me to armenian pizzas and now I feel angry that there aren't any near me. Do yourself a favour and buy 6 armenian pizzas with no toppings and savour its yumminess. The guy at the counter is also super random and funny!"}
{"text":"The Armenian sausage pizza (Soujouk) was a joy, especially at its cheesiest and meatiest parts. I wish they'd let you have free unlimited toppings like a Subway would, instead of the 2-3 limit. But overall, the help there was friendly and the food was a nice quick bite to eat on a cold day."}
{"text":"I had Arouch for a business lunch. The team had ordered different types of Armenian pizza and an assortment of salads. I had the spinach/cheese Armenian pizza but it was a bit dry since the team didn't order any extra toppings. The salads were super convenient as they were individually packaged. I had the Armenian couscous, that had a lemon tomato base with a melange of lovely Armenian spices. I would be curious to try this place out in person. Reminded me of a fancy Al-tayab wrap!"}
{"text":"Pour des lahmajoun à prix abordable ou des desserts arméniens, c'est l'endroit par excellence. Pour avoir goûté à la vraie cuisine arménienne, le goût retrouvé est authentique."}
{"text":"pretty good for the price and ideal for lazy and hungry Concordia students, food is authentic."}
{"text":"So I went to Arouch late one night recently while I was in Montreal.  I was in the mood for some meat pies (lahmajouns)!  They are $2.49 each if you don't get any toppings on them.  I like my meat pies plain and simple (no toppings).

The guy serving me was really nice and was making jokes the whole time (not in a creepy way, just in a trying to be friendly way).  I had ordered one spicy and one non-spicy.  Honestly, when I got back to my hotel room, I couldn't tell which was which, even after eating half of each.  Neither was very spicy.

At any rate, the meat pies were good.  The dough was really thin, and crispy around the edges.  The meat was not that plentiful, but it had a good flavour to it.  

I would say they are on the small/thin side.  I probably could have eaten 3 of them.  

I would definitely return if I'm back in Montreal, close by and have a craving for meat pies!"}
{"text":"Wanted something different and I drove by this place and stopped.

Just a bit past lunch so it wasn't busy which was great. The man who works there was friendly and the young girl as well but she was new so she didn't understand what I was asking for. I wanted tzatzki she said lemon dressing lol why not. I got the beef it was okay but next time I would get Zatar and cheese this seemed to be the crowd favourite. One thing I didn't like was that the drinks were warm in the fridge and that the little salad was a pretty small portion and apparently it smelt like fish lol, I didn't notice but after opening it that's the comment I heard. I would go back defs to try different styles but not make it a trio meal kinda thing."}
{"text":"I always pass by never come in. Today I did no regrets.
The \"pizza\" it's delicious and affordable. They make take out so it's good for sitting and eating as well taking with you."}
{"text":"Easy, quick, inexpensive bite to eat when in a hurry to your next JMSB class (or the metro).  It's in a very convenient location with an entrance directly inside the  JMSB building and the staff are friendly and helpful. It's modernized Armenian fare of the flat bread \"pizzas\" or lahmajoun.   They have veggie, halal and meat options and a modest list of additional topics toppings you can add. It's quite light and fresh, good for not falling asleep during class. Toppings include items such as olives, eggplant puree, tomatoes, lettuce, pickled turnips, and onions.  Don't expect to be stuffed by one \"pizza\" or you'll be disappointed, but consider it a better/healthier snack option than downing fries, doughnut or pastry.  Their dining area is clean and spacious even though their counter gives off more of a fast food vibe than café.  They also have a little prepared snacks open fridge that you can pick up additional snacks to complement the food. Overall, one of the healthier quick bites around Concordia metro."}
{"text":"This Armenian pizza is basically shame in a wrap. I have had Armenian pizza before so I know what it is supposed to be like. The toppings that I chose were dry like they were left in the middle of a desert for years and the flavour was off. Way off. Extraterrestrial. It was an insult to my taste buds."}
{"text":"This is a short-order line-style resto, but with a big surprise: fantastic levantine food at a very cheap price. It looks a little cheesy from the outside but inside it was clean enough and has fairly standard cafeteria-style seating to go with the cafeteria line. But, oh, the food! For $20 we got something like eight of the little pizzas - spicy meat, eggplant, cheese - and containers of spiced Armenian couscous and tabolueh. If you'd taken the same food and put it in a dark bistro with a maitre'd and candlelit tables with fancy regional decor, I'd likely be paying three times as much fairly gladly. But the combination of delicious food, friendly counter service (from the owner, we think), and a good value elevate this within class of great cheap unusual food to five stars. YUM."}
