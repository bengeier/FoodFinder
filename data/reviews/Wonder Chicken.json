{"text":"Not bad actually their meals are quite good.  I ordered braised pork belly meal ($8.49 before tax) it's a fair price for me considering the quality, it's yummy and comes with bean sprouts, seaweed and radish. These veggies make the box more nutritious, the quality of rice is good and pork belly is not salty. Moreover, they can deliver for free when your order is over $20, that's really good for me, and usually delivered within 30min.  The portion size is medium, not extremely small, ok for me.  As for the chicken cutlet, I'm a bit disappointed. It's plain with no particular flavor, so you have to dig it in Thousand Island sauce provided. And it's $8. Not satisfied.  Another suggestion for the restaurant is they should provide more options of dipping sauce.  I'll order delivery again in the future."}
{"text":"Wonder Chicken? More like: Wonder-how-this-place-stays-in-business!  Ordered two meals for two people, the pork belly and the chicken combo. The place was empty except for one other guy, he looked sad -- maybe because he was eating alone, but maybe because he was having the misfortune of eating at this place.  The pork belly arrived at least 20 minutes before the chicken. We nibbled on this dish, but couldn't actually BEGIN our meal.  The person at the counter looked up from texting and told us to \"just wait\" for our missing meal, which we did. I understand the chicken is likely made to order, but this doesn't account for why the pork belly arrived so much earlier. This wasn't a two-course meal. A little more coordination would have been appreciated.  When the chicken combo FINALLY arrived, the fries were missing. We pointed this out to the waitress, who ran away to fetch it. She then unceremoniously dumped it on the table without so much as an apology or explanation. Nice.  The chicken was fine."}
{"text":"The employee (I think he is the owner?) working today was very social and informative about our meal and the great thing was we only had to wait 10 minutes for 3 bento boxes. I would recommend the chicken cutlet and the pork belly (probably the best pork belly i've ever had). The price is pretty cheap considering the chicken isn't frozen and prepped daily. If you think its a bit pricey compared to other locations (for example Sugar Marmalade) its because of the quality of the chicken. I suggest you do NOT go here if you're expecting a thick batter for the chicken!"}
{"text":"Order through Just-Eat. Disappointing!   The food came at 8:30 PM when it was suppose to be here at 7:45 PM. The driver called once saying will be here in 20 mins but wasn't here. I called him at 8 PM and was told will be here in 10 minutes. It came at 8:30. According to the menu, it's supposed to come with rice and all those other stuff, it came with NOTHING. I just got the soggy oily cold piece of chicken in a paper bag. Also, a box of cold fried popcorn chicken. The bubble tea was warm. Threw everything in the trash and had to re-order from elsewhere! The driver was also not providing friendly service! But at least they return all my money back!"}
{"text":"Tried this new place that's south of the annex. It is expensive and the portions are on the small side, but it tastes fantastic. The Wonder Chicken is fried, lightly breaded, mixed spices, boneless meat. It tastes really good, and made even better by the house thousand island dressing dipping sauce. One piece of chicken for 8 bucks, but it's worth it. It tastes very fresh, and high quality and is amazingly cooked and served hot."}
{"text":"I ordered 2 Braised Premium Pork Belly and a Bubble Milk Tea from Wonder Chicken last night through Just-eat.ca for delivery.   I absolutely enjoyed the braised pork belly w/ rice. As a Taiwanese myself, I just had to order it as it's one of the iconic/signature dishes of casual Taiwanese dining and I can confidently say that every element in that one bento box really had an authentic taste to it. The Bubble tea was decent to say the least.  Like most of the other comments before mine, I do agree that portion sizes are a bit small for its price (at least for my taste), but that's pretty much my only complaint as I understand the restaurant is still relatively new.  Overall, a bit pricey, but quite satisfying. A good place to get a quick bite or takeout. Will order again in the near future."}
{"text":"Standard Taiwanese restaurant.   Good: Environment, clean, bright & friendly cashier.  Bad: As noted earlier it's portion is small...too small for its price. Especially when it's located near Chinatown and there're a lot of restaurants that are way cheaper.  Conclusion: If you have a lot of money then go for it. Otherwise, you're better off dining somewhere else for your money."}
{"text":"Ordered through foodora today at 5:17pm- took them forever to receive my order they didn't receive it till 5:46p and till now at 6:49pm I haven't gotten my order and the delivery guy is just on his way and he message me saying the restaurant  was too slow and only gave him my order at around 6:32pm. It's  a shame, my first and never again. I haven't tasted the food for its not even here."}
{"text":"small portion...its really expensive consider its fried chicken, most of sides are cold and probably purchased from supermarkets... However, it's a clean space and cozy place. Just the food is not that good."}
{"text":"This was a case of reverse psychology that worked on me. LOL After reading so many horrible reviews I was actually quite intrigue. I wanted to see first hand how bad the chicken really is as most have said and how horrible the service was. To my surprise, my experience was a little different. No, I guess I didn't let the chicken sit in a takeout bag, sweating for an hour before I ate it so we're definitely on different grounds. But that begs the question, why are people eating soggy fried chicken that's been in a bag for the past hour? Admittedly this stuff is not cheap like KFC toonie Tuesdays (is it still around?) but I think it's a fair price to pay for delicious freshly fried chicken. There was something said that I agree with, the wait times are long but I was told it will take a while because it's freshly fried. Not that it justifies the wait but as someone who cooks a lot, I can understand that fresh food does take time.  To sum it up, the chicken is juicy with a nice thin and crispy batter. It could be a bit more aromatic. The spice levels need to be amped up a bit more. I am not going to say it's the best Taiwanese fried chicken I've had (especially not after just returning from a trip from Taiwan) but it's pretty good for fried chicken that is served 1/2 around the world from it's motherland.  I'll be back hopefully to try some of the other stuff on the menu some day. Great place for a not-so-quick snack if you're hungry."}
{"text":"I wanted fried chicken, and so when I was walking along Harbord to pick up BBQ for hubby at Pig Out, I thought why not try something new when I saw Wonder Chicken.  I ordered popcorn chicken with chili spice and fried chicken with salt and pepper spice.   The person taking my order said it would take 15 minutes and it did, but no biggie, I just walked to Pig Out and back and it was ready.  Obligatory pun coming - Wonder Chicken?  I wonder what that sweet spice smell is?  Here is the thing... I had never had Taiwanese fried chicken before, and so when I got it home and opened the boxes, I was taken aback by the overpowering smell of a spice that I assume was Chinese five spice, which smells sweet and super strong to me.  It didn't taste overpowering but the constant fragrance was off putting for me.    I thought salt and pepper would be just that but it also had the same five spice taste.  I ordered just chicken but they do have combos with many sides which I can't comment on since I didn't try any.  If there are any Taiwanese students at U of T, they should definitely check out Wonder Chicken because the menu looks very authentic.  Just call in your order and pick it up 15 minutes later."}
