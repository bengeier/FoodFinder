{"text":"What a mess this place is.  Waited in front of cash register for several minutes waiting to order.  No one not one employee ever greeted me or took my order.  One guy was cleaning a fryer a another employee walked by carrying a cleaning supplies and I saw someone else in the back.  I just left.  I tried to call an speak with the manager to let her know and the employee that answered the phone said she could not speak English?  Wow this was a very bad experience I will never return.."}
{"text":"From what I understand, Yelp is to review unique and fun places, not your typical everyday joints. For this review, and those rules, please accept my apology. What I have to say must be heard.

You see, Arby's is an amazing place. It is lumped in with the McDonalds and Burger Kings of the world, when in fact, it should hold a different place in the hearts of Americans. 

When I was 16 years old I landed my first real paper paycheck job at an Arby's in Holland, MI. I thought I was big time. I made $8.00 an hour. I scored free grub from time to time. I flirted with the lizadies who came through the drive through window. What else could you want? 

Through my time at Arby's I learned a man named Russ Umphimheimer owns the most Arby's under an umbrella corporation called RTM. He also owned a few other joints I think a Hardees (never seen one), a breakfast roll place, etc. Arby's was his crowning achievement though. He owned an empire of roast beef and curly fries. I met him once and shook his hand. He had a bunch of gold rings. 

Anyway, now you have the background of my review, and you see I am only giving this joint 2 stars, you have to wonder why. I will tell you why..  no green beans on the menu.

Through out parts of the mid-west and the south there are renegade rebel Arby's. They were not bought out by RTM during Russ Umphenhimer's Arby's empire take over. Think of these places as the rebel alliance in Star Wars, and the RTM Arby's as The Empire. Russ Umphenhimer can be Darth Vader if you want him to be, but he's really not that mean. 

RTM (stands for Results Through Motivation) set a menu standard through out his millions of Arby's. Every menu had to be the same. You can always tell when you are in a rebel Arby's because they will have some random stuff on the menu, such as green beans. The franchisee operator will sell you green beans (at least they used to), but hardly any of the Arby's would order them because they were all RTM Arby's and thus, couldn't be free to set the menu as they saw fit. 

This Arby's had it's typical roast beef sandwiches. I opted for the beef and cheddar sans red ranch sauce, cause I think it's gross and I saw somebody dump a whole tub on their head once and run around chasing a girl. Bad juju right there. I also ordered the chicken fingers, which are back on the menu after a couple year MIA stint. Topped it off with an order of curly fries and a jamoca shake. I can't spell jamoca. Sorry. 

The food I ordered was great for a fast food joint, and worth the extra dollar to upgrade me from a whopper or big mac. However, to have a truly 5 star Arby's experience, I lust for the day where I can order green beans off of a fast food menu and have a hearty chuckle about this fact. Until this day, fight The Empire, and support your local rebel Arby's (they usually have those old signs \"Arby's Rost Beef Sandwich is Delicious\")."}
{"text":"This review is based on worker, Nastassja, who gave us the best service you could ask for. I've been in the restaurant industry for over 15 years and helped open numerous locations. Plain and simple, I would steel her away from Arby's. She was attentive, very pleasant, and even took our dirty trays for us. Nothing you would expect from Arby's. Thank you Nastassja..."}
{"text":"I love me some roast beef sandwiches with Arby sauce. Definitely something different than the normal hamburgers and fries joints. I do recommend the curly fries and especially the potato cakes. And if you're in the mood for dessert I do recommend the turnovers I'm depending on the mood apple or cherry."}
{"text":"$6.68 for two turkey classics in the drive through.  I kinda think that is a little pricey for just bread and turkey and nothing else.  I'm just sayin.  I am not a fast food chick by any means but I thought fast food was cheaper than that.  Anyways, the sandwiches are good....definitely not $6.68 good but what can you do when your short on time?!  Guess they got me. ;)"}
{"text":"I'm a big Arbys fan and just moved to Vegas. I was excited to discover there was one right down the street. Needless to say I will never return. My roast beef sandwich barely had any meat on it, fries were warm and stale, and my soda was flat. Went back inside after going through the drive thru and felt as if I was disturbing them. The place was dead by the way. Bad customer service and poor quality of food. Very disappointing"}
{"text":"I usually go to this location all the time & tonight I went through the drive through and it took literally 45 mins and then I get to the window and they tell me they don't accept $50s there was no warning anywhere and the Manager Emily had no urge to help us. Lost all business with me. Don't go here. Would rather not eat."}
{"text":"Wow, so a fast food resturant really be clean, have soap and towels, be courtious, get the order right, and have the food taste good."}
{"text":"It's fast food, so don't expect a 5...

Restaurant was clean, service prompt, food was acceptable. 

Is it really meat?  100% beef, roasted?"}
{"text":"I always forget about this location, but it's been here for ages- BF used to live nearby and would walk here to get fries late at night. As it is, a craving for fries is what brought me to their drive thru today in the first place. BF caught sight of their new featured brisket burger and insisted on getting a combo. 

When we got to the window, I asked to add on an order of potato bites but the manager-looking guy who was helping us said it would be a good 5 minutes or so because he had to make them fresh. I thanked him for the heads up and declined the add on.

When we got down the street to a red light, I stuck my hand in the bag to get some fries. And they were stale and cold. Dude, if you have the foresight to warn me about the potato cakes, I should have received the same heads-up about my fries. I think it's safe to reasonably expect fries that are at least warm, but clearly this location can't handle that.

The burger also was lukewarm, but the flavors were actually fairly good, all things considered. I continue to wonder how they're still in business seeing as how they rarely have customers and serve cold food.."}
{"text":"Wanted to try the new buffalo chicken sandwich . I waited about 8 minutes in the drive through to get it. And when i did the bottom bun was full of sauce and all soggy there was WAY to much sauce on it , plus it was really cold sauce. When i bit into it. The sandwich was extremely hot. And the chicken seemed hard. So basically it was a combination of cold because of the sauce and hot because the chicken was hot . I threw it away after 1 bite. Never going to that location again"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE!!! 

Placed a order for One Combo & 2 Sandwiches... They only had one cook and we waited over 15 minutes... Ok we understand there busy... But that doesn't explain why ALL my freaking food was ice cold.. Did the chef forget to cook it or what? I got up and told the cashier.. When I told her all my food was cold she just stood there all puzzled not knowing what to do... 

This time they took 25 minutes to remake the order even though we were the only ones in the restaurant! 

I told the cashier we have been here almost an hour and wanted my money back! She was hasnieat at first but I walked out the 5 minutes later with my money and charged $5 bucks for my 2 small drinks.. 

 If your in a hurry to eat or don't feel like idiots you shouldn't eat here."}
{"text":"What can you say - it's an Arby's - but damn I miss Arby's now that there isn't one in San Francisco.  So this one is cleaner than the one I always go to in Santa Monica so hence the four stars..."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a shake while waiting on the bus.  I ordered a small chocolate shake.  It was not mixed very well.  I had to use my straw to mix it before I could drink it.  Not that great.  It is foamy and definitely from a machine.  I would not recommend a shake from here and won't order a shake here again.  It is drinkable, just not that great."}
{"text":"Just because it's fast food doesn't mean it's not tasty... The smokehouse brisket was good... Horsey sauce made the curly fries taste better..."}
{"text":"Even though the prices are a bit high, the food is always good here and I'm a big fan of their arby sauce. Lately they've been keeping 2 for 1 deals which keeps me coming back rather than be a 1 or 2 time a year customer. They also having been trying new things like curly fries with melted cheese covered on it and a Miami Cuban sandwich and Texas Brisket sandwich. My friend got the mint chocolate shake and it looked real good. If they keep up with the deals and the food quality, then i'll continue coming here."}
{"text":"I remember Arby's quality being better about 10 years ago. The sandwiches were filled with roast beef and the prices were great. Now they barely put roast beef in the bread and the prices have gone up too much. I used to enjoy it a lot, but times have changed"}
{"text":"I'll start off positive and say the food was hot and fresh when I got home. But the customer service was bad enough for me to not return. I had to repeat my order a few times in the drive thru and when I double checked it at the window both girls gave me a snooty look and an eye roll. I was extremely polite to them and does it really put you out of your way to give me sauce or a drink holder ugh. I won't go back!"}
{"text":"Typical Arby's. Not superb but good enough as a fast food. Don't have high expectations from the employees but expect the food to be decent which is was. Custom order always just to make sure you get fresh food. This is a pattern with any fast food restaurant. Especially a place like Arby's."}
{"text":"Big Arby's fan here - love the fresh sandwiches and the different varieties of specials. Recently had such a terrible experience at the store closest to my home that I've been purposefully avoiding Arby's. Today Arby's was right there next to my bank so I came in to eat. 

Now that I've eaten though, im doubting the decision to revisit Arby's. The service is kind of lacking. I walked in the door and up towards the counter and before I could even get there I was acknowledged - but I stead of \"Hi,\" or \"Hello\" I was greeted from 5 steps away with \"For here or to go.\"  I placed my order with the young lady who wasn't rude, but also not friendly.

Certainly lackluster service isn t enough to make me doubt if I should have come in to eat. But after placing my order a young man came from the back and said to me Arby's is nasty and shook his head. He and the young lady the exchanged in some personal conversation while I was waiting - all of which made me wonder why I was eating here. She asked if she should get some food and he responded that he wouldn't.  She made a funky face and looked up at the menu before walking away. Well - I started thinking if he wouldn't eat here why would I?  I'm hoping that this was a joke between the two of them - but their interaction reinforced his earlier comment and made wonder whether or not I wanted to eat before I'd even received my food. 

As I walked out of the front door this same young man was cleaning the table right next to the door - without acknowledgement. Less than two steps away from me I never received a \"thanks,\" \"have a good day,\" or \"how was everything?\"  Just looking down at the table. Kind of the ending I'd expect though after the rest of my experience. 

My final analysis, find a better option."}
{"text":"Horrible. My husband and children ordered 2 chicken, bacon and Swiss, 4 beef and cheddar and a potato cake. We waited more than 20 minutes for the chicken sandwiches and when they finally arrived they were crispy chicken sandwiches. My husband asked for what he ordered. He waited an additional 10 minutes. All they did was remove the chicken from the crispy chicken sandwiches and add bacon and Swiss. The ranch and mayo was still on the sandwich. No mustard sauce. Health codes require a wrong sandwich to be tossed out and the correct sandwich to be made. This is to prevent food born illness. They violated safe food handling practices. The beef and cheddar were cold and the potato cakes were frozen. I'm talking completely frozen solid. Really? To add to this colossal waste of time and money, shortly after, my husband got sick. Nausea and diarrhea. This morning he is still belching from his bout of food poisoning from those bad chicken sandwiches. Will never eat at that location again. Asking for a refund too."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible! What happened to Arby's? I used to love their food but every time I come here it's less than desirable. Curly fries are cold and just don't taste good anymore. I tried their Smoke Mountain sandwich combo and for almost $13 you get crappy cold fries, a flat, mashed sandwich with nasty onion fries and Bork belly that's 90% fat. The soda was ok. What a disappointment! Not coming back again, ever!"}
{"text":"Seriously WAY to expensive for fast food. I could eat a Chilis 2 for 20. Seriously $25 for three sandwiches. Get a grip!!! And it wasnt even that good."}

It's roast beef!

And a bun!

And curly fries!

Haters be damned."}
{"text":"Ordered from the drive thru, just basic order, roast beef meal and an additional jr roast beef. The food was fine, it was just the customer service and attitude. The guy who took my order seemed high and just DGAF attitude. Funny thing is I think he was the manager on duty because he had one of those button down shirts. His persona was \"I hate my job, I hate my life, and I hate you\" curly fries were on point tho"}
{"text":"Arby's is one of those places that sounds good, but after you eat it, you're terribly disappointed.  I used to love them when I was growing up.  I don't know if I just grew out of them or if they've changed, but their food just tastes awful now.  It tastes like it's loaded with preservatives.  I will say this, the one saving grace to this meal was their brown sugar bacon was very good.  And I will say that this Arby's was clean with a friendly staff unlike several I've been in over the past few years, that were filthy.  But the roast beef was terrible.  And the curly fries taste way over-seasoned and were all stuck together.  Not to mention, they had the Dr. Pepper and Root beer lines mixed up so each tasted like a little bit of each.  I need to remember this for the next time Arby's sounds good."}
{"text":"The food here is horrible and the tables are not cleaned like they should be. The bathroom is very dirty as will."}
{"text":"This location is HORRIBLE!  We came in and stood at the front counter for 5 mins and never saw 1 employee.  NO ONE.  Not a cashier a cook nothing.  After 5 mins we were greeted with a \"My bad how can I help you\"  We waited over 20 mins for our food that ended up being wrong.  Manager was extremely rude and could hardly even speak English.  This location is ridiculous do yourself a favor and drive a little further for a better experience and fresher food.  We didnt even stay, I took my money back and went to another location."}
{"text":"Look, I grew up in the Midwest where there are a ton of Arby's all around. I expect the higher prices and a bit slower service. That's just what it is. I'm ok with that. It's the only fast food restaurant where I trust that the meat is, in fact, actually just meat. And I think as far as drive through options are concerned, this offers the most options for someone trying to not die of a heart attack. 

This Arby's is just eh. I have yet to meet an Arby's on this side of the country that meets the standards of the average Arby's back home. I don't get it. This is cowboy food. It should be better here. But whatever. 

So this location- today was my first time there. Probably not going back... Maybe? But probably not. I was there at 10:30 am. Not a normal time for an Arby's visit but I was leaving the pediatrician's office and decided this would be a better lunch than whatever I could make from my boring groceries at home. Also, my poor kid got a shot and I figured I'd treat him to some French fries. (Don't judge me- we do this very rarely.)

So at 10:30, I understand if they aren't fully ready to go with all the menu items, but omg this visit took a full 15 minutes or more. That's a long time to be getting fast food. And I was the only one in line when I pulled in but then someone came in behind me and I felt all guilty for making them wait.. I didn't even order anything weird. 

The food was fine. No complaints. It's par for the Arby's course. 

The service was lack luster. I swear there were only 2 people working and the guy was absent from the window for a long long time when he was getting my food. :( No enthusiasm or joy in their demeanors. 

Basically, I will think about coming back if I'm really, really not in a rush and want to have time to sit in my car and text people or check Facebook. Otherwise, this is not worth the time suck or awkwardly unfriendly encounter with the staff."}
{"text":"we have the meats we have the meats the commercial is just as good as the food it's so good i ended up getting a gyro and a ruben"}
{"text":"Horrible location.  Lousy service. Manager is a jerk.  Won't accept coupons printed directly from Arby's official website.  I can't say enough bad about this particular location.  I love Arby's, but just avoid this location."}
{"text":"Arby's is pricey but it's good! I'm a low carb eater so any trip to a fast food restaurant is an expensive proposition because I only eat the meat instead of the cheap fries, bread and carby sides. I love this Arby's because they will happily give me a sandwich sans bun (yep, just a big container of meat)! The employees here are very friendly and always smiling and their roast beef is hot and tasty."}
{"text":"If you are going to do fast food you could do far worse than Arby's. I enjoy the traditional roast beef sandwich(s) and I am in love with Horsey Sauce. This horseradish sauce is so good it should be reclassified as a \"beverage\".
What would normally be a four-star rating drops to two-stars at this location because the service is so poor. I work near this Arby's so frequently someone in the office makes an \"Arby's run\". It is a rare day that the order is correct. Inevitably some items are missing, prepared wrong or there are overcharges on the bill. In addition to the inaccuracy of the service the employees are SLOW! It is hard to get in and out in under 15 minutes, even if you are only getting a soda. 
I had noticed that they have a pattern in their service. 
1) Take an order from the customer
2) Wait till that order is complete and delivered to the customer
3) Take the next order for the next customer
Yes, the counter person will actually ignore the people staring blankly in line and wait by the pass-through window for the sandwiches on order.
Please note, my dissatisfaction is only with this location. Other Arby's are run efficiently, yet for some reason this unit has a manager that is not detail oriented. This is evident from the advertising poster quoting \" 'tis the season to give Arby's gift cards\", a poster that should not have been hanging up in late June. Worse than the lack of attention given to the advertising art is the manager's lack of attention to the store's sanitation. It is -- at best -- grimy. Where floor meets wall there is a dark build-up of mop residue; what we in the industry call \"mop slop\". This staining tells me they mop the dining room floors with dirty water. Table bases and chairs have not been wiped down in moths (or years) and there is a staining on the walls from when smoking was permitted in restaurants. I can only imagine what the kitchen looks like.
In conclusion I'll say I like Arby's, but this store lacks the service and management to match the standards of the chain. If you do go there check your order and your receipt before leaving."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love Arbys? I have always loved the beef and cheddar....roast beef with some melty yummy cheesy goodness. I do say I also LOOOOOVE the loaded potato bites, but I am a sucker for anything loaded with carbs. I feel less guilty eating here than at other fast food places, but who am I kidding? I'm sure calorie wise its all about the same."}
{"text":"Growing up in the Bay Area, we hardly ever went to Arby's (the only one I remember was near Tanforan). So when we moved here, we went to this fast-food restaurant chain a little more. When I was pressed for time, in my 20s, this was often a staple. But through the years, it seems like many branches are closing. Sad. 

This one located in between Katie and Flamingo on Maryland, is a little dated, but it's spacious, and there is a bathroom in the back (clean for the most part). The sauce pumping station also has napkins (you pump the sauce into little cardboard cups). You can get horsey sauce, mmm, or ketchup.

Enter fast-food research (calories, fat, etc.) recently and beef cravings (I eat mostly chicken and turkey). We went here on wednesday night (and had some grocery shopping to do at Sam's Club). There was a couple other customers besides us including the drive-thru window- it was empty (could be because people like McD's better because it's cheaper maybe). We both got combos and it was a little less than $13.00. We both got the french dip sandwiches except my husband got the curly fries and I got the potato cakes. My husband said the sandwiches were smaller than they used to be (and mentioned that he was still a little hungry afterward). I liked the soft french roll, thinly sliced beef, and the au jous sauce (plus it's one of the better things you can can have on the menu, check the nutrition part online). And I have always loved the potato cakes, perfectly golden and crisp on the outside, and softer inside (the ham and cheese was also one of my favorites too). Free Refills on drinks. 

I guess because it was pretty much dead, we didn't encounter any problems like Bruce D. Cashier was nice too, BTW. You can tell the workers were bored, because one of them was cleaning the rest of the tables, and he asked how we were doing when he passed us. Another customer came in by the time we left. When we passed by again, business seemed to have picked up because there were more cars in the parking lot and there were customers in the drive-thru window too (and this was around 7:30/8 pm)."}

{"text":"I like Arby's, the food is always good, the service is acceptable but the prices are outrageous. I know, everyone has a $1 menu these days but if you are looking for an actual meal, they want an arm and a leg. This is a fast food joint, not a sit down and be served kind of place. This location is ok, not the nicest, definitely not the cleanest but I will still make the stop once every year or so."}

1.  Did not acknowledge us for quit awhile even though no one was in line or waiting and only one car in the drive thru.

3.  Forgot our shakes
4. While waiting for the shakes another person from the drive through came in because he literally had only ONE slice of roast beef on his sandwich.
5.  Another person came in and said he was given the wrong sandwich
6.  The shakes tasted horrible because it comes through the same spout and it mixed with the new berry shake
7. My husband sandwich maybe had three slices of roast beef, if that!
8.  When I asked who the manager was the guy \"Fredrika\" just said \"I am\" but didn't ask how he could help me, just looked at me like I was bothering him.

What happened Arby's?"}
{"text":"Won't come here and eat here anymore. Food is not not fresh. Good customer service bad execution foods looks so sloppy. Like old meat."}
{"text":"I was in the drive through for about 11 minutes which I though was unusual for arbys. I paid with a 20 dollar bill and gave him .20 cents. Instead of giving me my change the guy hands me my food and drink all at once (thought that was super weird). I almost dropped everything. Then asked if I wanted Arby's sauce, never giving me my change. Since I knew I was running late now for my appointment I didn't think about it until later that evening when I realized I should have had the exact change to pay for my nails. I counted my money when I got home and realized I was short $11. I think he did it on purpose, saw that I was distracted and in a hurry and took advantage. I called them right away and actually spoke to the guy I dealt with. Since the restaurant was no where near my house I asked if they could mail me a check. He said he would ask his manager and call me back. Never called back. Lesson learned to pay attention. Posting this so others will see and pay attention as well. I find it very hard to believe that a fast food place would do all these other things before giving the change back to the guest. Fishy if you ask me."}
