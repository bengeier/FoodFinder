{"text":"I live here, does that mean I'm biased?

Anyways, I was happy with my experience at Harbour Club. The food is plain, predictable, and conventional. Nothing about this place stands out besides the fact that it over-looks our condo pool and has daily specials.

But you know what, if this place were ever to disappear I'd be really sad. For $13-$15 dollars you can get a nice, conservative dinner with generous portions. I really liked their tuna steak pasta and my SO's salmon dish was not bad either. 

It's really not fair to compare this place to normal restaurants because it is only available to visitors of the building. I would go here more often if I was more lazy and rich :)"}
{"text":"This place needs a major reno job, but where they lack in decor they make up in great service and affordable prices of decent food. I found out about it because my friend lives in the building told me they offer room service to residents - how awesome is that if you're lazy like me. Since then, I have eaten in the restaurant multiple times. 

The staff are friendly and super social since most of the clientele are regulars who live in the condo. You are always welcome to join in on the latest conversation that is sure to bring laughs. Staff are willing to play what you want on the tvs (there is one huge projection screen in the dining area and 2 tvs at the bar) or the music of your choice. Being such an obscure restaurant, the perk is they will pretty much accommodate almost anything you want. Diners once pooled money together for the pay-per-view UFC fight and everyone watched it on the big projector screen. Another time, a friend threw a birthday party there for over 20 people.

Now about the food - the menu is nothing to gush over.  They have your staple pub fare, choices of pizza and pastas and some spicier Indian dishes.  I am a HUGE fan of the spaghetti carbonara - it is the one and only item I get each and every time.  When I'm not there, I crave for it.  It's better than most carbonaras from bigger establishments - no joke!  It punches you in the face with flavour and the portion size can feed you twice.  The next best thing to order is the butter chicken - nom!  The wine list is small but sooo cheap.  

If you are looking for something fancy or stylish, this is not where you want to be, but if you want that 'Cheers' (for you millennials - that was a popular show in the '80's) type of feel and don't want to break the bank - I think you will be surprisingly pleased here. Not my favourite spot in the city but I find myself coming back here."}
{"text":"This is convenience dining that is stuck in decades past. Located within a residential building at 99 York Quay, this restaurant feels like a cross between the cafeteria at a seniors' home and the restaurant at a Best Western. 

It's on the 10th floor of the building and features a nice view of the lake if you sit on the south side. There's a small bar-lounge area as well that usually has one or two lonely type sports-obsessed men drinking and swearing loudly at men on the television.

The dining area also overlooks the building's pool, which is unfortunate because the smell of chlorine seeps into the dining area and is overwhelming if you sit near those windows.

The restaurant does room service for people who live in the building and from the emptiness of the dining area it would seem that room service is the main portion of their business.

On both occasions I've been, the servers have all been young women. That said, the service has generally been good which is why I'm giving this two stars instead of one. The food unfortunately, has not been very good.

While I'm grateful that they actually have not one, but three vegetarian entrees on the menu - one of which is vegan; the vegetable stir fry, I was not even mildly impressed by what I had here.

The pasta dish I tried is titled \"Pasta with vegetables in tomato sauce\" and after confirming that the tomato sauce was vegetarian (I've actually been to places that put beef broth in their basic tomato sauce) I was brought a pinkish coloured sauce and upon questioning, discovered that parmesan cheese had been mixed in with the sauce in a misguided attempt to enhance a bland tomato sauce. Even though dairy is not listed in the description, be clear that you want a dairy-free meal!

The vegetables in the pasta were broccoli, cauliflower and some very chunky undercooked carrots. Strangely, the penne pasta was a mixture of rigate, the ribbed kind and lisce, the smooth penne, which only shows how careless they really are in the kitchen. Who mixes different pasta types at a restaurant? I wouldn't even do that at home since cooking times vary. Plus, every chef knows that rigate is good for holding certain types of sauce and lisce would not be appropriate for a dish like this.

The vegetable stir-fry was overly sweet and it featured some very blandish vegetables that I can only imagine are used as the sides for their more popular meat dishes: broccoli, cauliflower, bell peppers, and a tonne of onions! It could have benefitted from a better sauce and the addition of something like snow peas, baby corn, bok choy, water chestnuts, bamboo shoots, or bean sprouts, you know, stir-fry veggies? And how about some tofu? They sell it at Sobey's across the street and it keep for weeks unopened. Just try it some time.

They have a daily special soup that always sounds like it would be vegetarian: \"Cream of broccoli\", \"Leek and potato\", but it never is. It's probably safe to say they put chicken stock in all their soups.

Overall, this place is not entirely awful. The mostly elderly clientele do not have adventurous tastes and the food reflects that.

As a side note, if you are differently-abled there's a convoluted elevator system to get you here and on Sundays, that elevator contains garbage during dinner hours, so there's an even MORE convoluted route involving three different elevators, including one that only goes 2 floors. All this to get to a less than mediocre restaurant on the 10th floor. I would advise against anyone who needs a cane, cruches, or wheelchair from coming here to dine on a Sunday.

Oh and it's not really a club."}
{"text":"Okay food, but this is a quiet oasis in the midst of all the crowds at the harbour front during summer. The food is inexpensive as well. This is a great place for kids to rejuvenate, my daughter loved the elevator to the 10th floor and the views of the water and the indoor pool. 

I had the butter chicken which was ok, nothing to write home about, taking one star off because of that.

Service was good - friendly and attentive."}
