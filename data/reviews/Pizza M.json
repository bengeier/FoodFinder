{"text":"If you'd like to eat and want your food within an hour and a half, do not go to this restaurant. 

The owner is extremely rude and it trickles down to employees.  DON\"T WASTE YOUR TIME!!!!"}
{"text":"I love  this place!! The event I attended here was fantastic and the service was excellent...Ana at the bar was talkative and pleasant and the space in the back is very haute couture for chambana...wish they would open it for at least Friday Saturday night!! Sugar Bear pizza and Bell's 2 Hearted...does it get any better?!"}
{"text":"We got a margerita pizza which was alright, and a \"Kitchen Sink\" (chef's choice) which ended up being basically a breakfast pizza with bacon, sausage, eggs and olives which was pretty good. Only three stars because although the food was decent, it was just not that filling for the price, the iced tea was average at best, the environment was not the most comfortable, and the server didn't even bring the condiments (cheese, red pepper flake, sriacha sauce, tabasco sauce) to our table, even though there were a ton of carriers. 

The environment was so bad that it actually negatively impacted the taste of the food. This place was probably the most hipster restaurant I have ever been to though. It was actually kind of uncomfortable. They had all jars in lieu of real cups, a sprawling and disorganized looking selection of brews and wines, an ad for \"bring your own vinyl night\", and clearly very hipster clientele. These were not like nice hipsters either. They were the stereotypical of uppity better-than-thou hipsters. My cousins and I clearly didn't belong, but we kept on getting mean-mugged and got dirty looks, ironically from dirty looking hipsters. 

It is a shame cause I actually thought their flavor combinations on the menu looked really interesting, but the rest of the environment really detracted from the experience for me. There were four of us, we killed two whole pizzas, and were still hungry afterwards, so we needed to go get a second dinner."}
{"text":"Updating this to 5 stars, now that they have fast, friendly delivery! Best pizza in Champaign-Urbana."}
{"text":"I have been here about 4 or 5 times, and have had very good experiences every time.  I really like this place for a couple different reasons.  

The atmosphere is very chill.  It doubles as a coffee shop, so you get a lot of students on their MacBooks just hanging out.  You order at the front, and the food is brought out to you, so it's very unintrusive (no wait staff).  You pay immediately, and if you want something else, you just go and get it.  The staff has always been very friendly, if not a little hipster.

The food is very good for the price.  We usually stick to the basics, but the topping selection is pretty eclectic.  Would probably feel right at home in a larger city.  The beer selection is also good (Two Hearted, 60 Minute, etc.) and had Triptych as well (shout out to local brewers).   They also have some basic wines by the glass that are fairly priced.

I still say that Papa Del's is the best pizza in town, but this is a great change of pace if you want a well made thin crust pizza (and don't want to overpay for an average Monical's pizza).

Overall, I would definitely recommend it to anybody.  Glad this place is doing well and hope they stick around for awhile."}
{"text":"Best pizza in C-U by a pretty wide margin; great crust, really interesting ingredients.  The limited hours, no delivery and lack of a dining area keep it pretty car-centric, but it is worth the drive to pick it up."}
{"text":"I stopped in here tonight with my husband and almost 3 year old. We try to support local, non-chain restaurants as much as possible and this place is a prime example of the reason why. Great food at a reasonable price. I had a glass of wine while my husband had two beers. We ordered the meat and cheese plate while we were waiting for our \"kitchen sink\" pizza to go. The meat and cheese plate had a good variety of meats, cheeses, crackers, with a delicious jam and mustard and was well worth the $15 price tag. The owner (I believe) also came out and explained each item which was a pleasant surprise. We will definitely work this into our regular lineup. Oh... and the pizza was fantastic too."}
{"text":"Architecturally the space is impressive. Glad to see this section of Urbana being developed. Unfortunately the pizza is average at best. The special slice today was gorgonzola, bacon, pears, walnuts and maple syrup...sounds delicious, right? Completely lacking in flavor...1 bite of gorgonzola in the whole massive slice...no maple flavor at all...and the crust though tasty had no sauce to help me choke it down. I don't need it swimming but something to wet the mouth would have been appreciated. I'll give it another shot but first experience wasn't great. Oh, and my friends got their slices first while I waited for mine...restaurant 101...the whole table gets their food at the same time"}
{"text":"Great gluten free crust and occasionally interesting special salads and soups.  Reasonably priced wine.  I also liked their outdoor seating in the summer.  I could stand a spicier tomato base, but this is my favorite pizza place in town.  I like the people working there.  Everyone has been friendly to me.  I wish there were more lunch options, so I just mainly go at dinner."}
{"text":"So let me start this review off by saying that Pizza M SHARES SPACE with a coffee shop. This can be a little disorienting for people walking in for the first time. 

That out of the way, I love this place. Great location in the heart of downtown Urbana with tasty and fairly priced pizza. I eat their often and have tried all of their different pizzas and never had a bad experience. I never found the employees here inadequate. The negative reviews for this place make me curious as to what people are expecting. This is an extremely casual dining environment and I think expecting some sort of service similar to having someone wait on your table is silly. I've never had any trouble ordering a pizza or having it take too long. Granted, I always expect it to take at least 40 minutes since their literally making you a pizza from scratch. Yes you are expected to clear your own table, and maybe that's an issue for some, but it isn't for me. I've never noticed any sort of \"holier than thou\" attitude from either the employees or the patrons. Not sure where the hate is coming from, but this is a really great place to get some pizza and one of the best restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"I ordered nine various pizzas for an event at my house and they were absolutely wonderful. All 27 people who were here raved.  The ordering process, the price, the person I communicated with - all were smooth, friendly, and professional.  I could not have been more pleased!  Hurray for Pizza M!!  Yum, yum, yum!!!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Pizza M from back when Matt was still baking pizzas one night a week out of Mirabelle's kitchen. I admit the pizza isn't bad. Sadly I cannot continue to support a business that has such egregiously rude employees (see the other reviews below that corroborate my point). I strongly urge you not to give this place your money - downtown Urbana absolutely deserves better."}
{"text":"We enjoy the pizza and have been enjoying it for a few years now. I was spectacularly unimpressed when I called in to order today, and the person who answered was quite rude and dismissive when I asked a few questions. I told the people working about it when I picked up the order, and hopefully they will learn to treat people who are trying to buy pizza from them a little better. I'll contemplate wether or not to return and enjoy the good pizza after this incident."}
{"text":"Great artisan pizza. Our favorite in U-C. Our standard is the Mediterranean with goat cheese instead of feta."}
{"text":"BEST PIZZA IN TOWN!

I really don't understand the bad reviews for this place. Yes, sometimes the wait is long but the pizza is made from scratch. If you want to eat some crap that only takes 15-20 minutes go somewhere else. Edible art is being made here. 

Service is always friendly and with a smile. 

Only thing I ask for (which I know is in the works), is more salads and soups. 

Keep up the amazing job!"}
{"text":"I like their unique selection of pizza, but they could work on their quality a bit. It's not bad, but it's just ok. The main reason I say \"just ok\" is because I feel the quality doesn't really match the price. I haven't tried much of the coffee there, but I was very impressed with the rosemary mocha; apparently herbs and coffee are a great combination. I'm not usually a fan of the open \"cafeteria style\" dining layout, but in this case it actually adds a lot of character to the place."}
{"text":"Really bad customer service. I cannot believe how rude the person on the phone was when I attempted to place an order.  Unbelievable to say the least."}
{"text":"Another case of the Emperor's New Clothes.  Someone of the artsy set decided that this relatively good but overpriced fare was great pizza and all the lemmings followed suit.  Will anyone tell the Emperor he has no clothes?  The limited hours, no delivery, and lack of dining area add to the snob appeal.  Don't be taken in."}
{"text":"Dear Pizza M,

I love: your pizza, your mission, your atmosphere 
However, I wish I could work on things longer than an hour before having to scheme a way to steal an outlet. Get more outlets. Also more speciality lunch slices."}
{"text":"I came in on Wednesday night for the trivia game. I ordered the special that night which was, if I can remember correctly, sausage onion garlic oregano and mushroom.  

The first thing I noticed about the pizza was the crust. Good crusts to me have that crunch and a little bit of chew to them and this crust fit that really well.  Secondly, the sauce... It had kind of a zip to it and a little bit of zestyness.  Then I noticed that the sausage was terrific. He said that they made the sausage there.  It had a lot of flavor.  Overall, it was a fantastic pizza very flavorful with all the right textures and fresh ingredients.

I'm kind of a pizza connoisseur and I would rate their pizza near the top of Champaign/Urbana's offerings.  Had some really intriguing pizzas on the menu. I believe that the pizzas were just a flat price of $15 and there are no small medium large there's just one size, which is kind of a refreshing thing...simplicity.  I will have to come back and try a different one."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza...the lunch slices are very generous and delicious. Great beer selection; open atmosphere good for a quick solo bite or meeting friends and lingering (not cramped and rushed like campus eateries can be). Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I have been a frequent customer here.  The good is tasty and the coffee drinks are amazing (in their morning hours they have coffee drinks and donuts, etc.) The staff is friendly and the service has been exceptional. The manager or owner called me personally when there was a mistake from my recent order.  Give this delicious restaurant a try if you haven't already!!"}
{"text":"Pizza takes a bit of a wait, but well worth it. I really enjoy the ambience and the fact that the restaurant shares its space with a cafe. I had some sort of Greek-style topping, including olives, artichokes and feta. Absolutely perfect, plus a little sriracha for kick. The crust has just enough chew and crunch to it. The best part about Pizza M is that you can get some coffee or pastry on the side. Or games! They have people do their game nights there, and it looks like a great idea."}
{"text":"My first visit to Pizza M was with a group who had reserved their back room. Upon arrival, I ordered a cup of hot green tea (cant remember which flavor) which was just okay (I wouldn't order it again....). A young lady waited on our group and was taking orders and when it came my turn to tell her I wanted their 10 inch Pear and Brea pizza, she walked away and said she had to put in the orders and she would be right back. Apparently, even writing down the other two orders was too much for her to also write down my order and submit them at the same time. The persons in my group all looked at each other like, \"What just happened?\". Another person in my group grabbed the ordering pad and pen she left behind and started to write their own order down for her. Of course, she never returned so I'm not sure what happened to the poor girl. Finally a guy came into the room and took my order and then brought all the pizzas out when they were done. So, the service was a bit disappointing to begin. The pizza itself was alright, but I've had much better elsewhere. I'll give them another try to see if it's better the second time and hope that the service is also a better experience."}
{"text":"Went for pizza and jazz on a Friday night. Staff were very very friendly and helpful. The pizza is the best thin crust in the Chambana region, in my opinion. Excellent selection and knowledge of the various beers they have on hand. The price was great and the ambience was fantastic. 

Definitely making this a regular stop on my Fridays."}
{"text":"Such unique choices!

While the sugar bear sounds like something that would never work, it is the most unique and delicious pizza I had ever had. 

HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMEND.

Wait is a bit longer on trivia night, but I would recommend taking for take-out and ordering ahead.

Large open space with larger tables to allow for students to study while chowing on some pizza."}
{"text":"The server disrespected my friend and I numerous times. We asked if we could order the pizza with our drinks and the server told us that it would take longer to get the drinks than it would to order the pizza. Fair enough, we wanted to order before the long time it took to get the drinks so we wouldn't be waiting, but I also work in service so I get that things can be hectic sometimes. However when she came back she said \"told you so\" to us with a very rude and condescending tone. I'm a very chill person so again, I just brushed it off. Then afterwards, we were heading towards the back and she yelled at my group and myself while wagging her finger at us. It was at this point that I realized that I would never be coming back to this restaurant because I don't like to be repeatedly be chastised and have someone take a combative tone with me. Again, if I took that tone with a customer at my job I would have been fired in no time flat. 
   It's sort of like when a customer snaps their finger at me... Just the opposite."}
{"text":"There are few things that I enjoy more than Pizza and Wine. So discovering this hidden gem was absolutely fantastic! 
 My boyfriend and I got into town later than anticipated one night and decided to try a new pizza place he was recommended. Although late, around 930, Pizza M was still cranking out pizzas, coffees, and offered a full bar in the back. The atmosphere was very welcoming, and the staff was very pleasent and helpful. We ordered our Pizza, which was the special of the night (saturday). Pesto base, cherry tomatoes, oinions, bacon, blu cheese crumbles and apples which was 16$ , and then proceeded to go to the bar and get a glass of wine 7$. 
 I'm not sure what the businesses weekly schedule is, but they had live music, it seemed jazzy, that night and it was really good. We received our pizza in a somewhat timely manner, seemed like it took maybe just a bit longer due to not many people being staffed, but being the case, we understood. The pizza was so good. Although the toppings seemed like an odd grouping we decided to try something new. The pizza was so Fresh and the toppings where perfect, just enough and it was very pleasant to the palate. We enjoyed our pizza and wine to music and good conversation.
 All in all Pizza M is a hidden gem! I will absolutely be returning, and bringing more guests too."}
{"text":"The people who work here are SO rude. After reading multiple reviews about bad customer service, how has nothing been done about this? We walk in, I tell the girl it's our first time. Not helpful at all. I ask about the sizes of the pizza, she points to the board. We order the pizza and I ask for waters, she points again. Ok. We get our pizza, it is average nothing special. After we finished we weren't sure if we were supposed to pick up after ourselves or leave the plates on the table. Looked around, didn't see anything besides a small container filled with glasses. I put our glasses in the container. We stacked up the plates then left it on the table. My friend ended up forgetting something so when we called back the person on the phone goes \"don't leave your plates on the table next time\".....oh there won't be a next time. Won't recommend it to anyone save yourself time and go to Antica, jets, papa dells, or monicals"}
{"text":"Please save your money and don't bother. I should have known when I walked in the door the combo coffee shop/pizza joint would really s@&k at one. The Pizza won. 

Paid over $30 for 2 pizzas   Cheese/sausage and cheese gluten free, 14 inch. By weight I figured it was about $25 per pound. Only ordered one but took them both as I thought maybe my wife did order. She didn't. Kudos to the coffee girl. The only one with a sense of urgency and literally the only one behind the counter. Seeing as the line was about 8 deep the worker eating with the customers could have picked a better time to socialize. 

So if you don't know good pizza and have too much disposable income. This place is for you. Everyone else. Avoid like the plague."}
{"text":"G/f and vegetarian pizza options; no vegan options.
The sauce was rather plain and had a slight metallic taste to the tomato flavor. 
The crust was overcooked so the pizza was crunchy under the cheese.
I tried the Mediterranean and added pepperoncinis.
The specialty pizzas are pretty standard in their topping combos, but you can also make your own.
The secret happy hour on Saturday is half price glasses of wine, so that was nice after paying $19 for a crunchy, so-so pizza. If I find myself here again I won't be mad, bit it will not have been my idea to stop in.
The g/f crust is a generic 10in, like many other pizza joints. Not worth it.
Is there anyone out there who makes fresh g/f crust in-house?!? The search continues..."}
{"text":"Well, i wanted to try Pizza M for a long time, and when we finally did, it was a real disappointment.  The pizza slices we got, Sausage and Pepperoni and Mushroom were average AT BEST.  Papa Dels and Jets are FAR superior.  The thing that really set me off was the price, at minimum twice as expensive as it should be.

I will not be going back again, this place is supposed to be one of the best in the state? LOL"}
{"text":"I get sad that I no longer live in C-U because we don't have a this pizza in my town!! Every single pizza I have had from here is absolutely delicious. I make it a point to get pizza here every time I visit. It's a must!!"}
{"text":"There Pizza is great!! only reason I give them two star is because one of the employee was a jerk(whoever is dripping coffee) Not a great customer service.. I would love to go there again for a pizza but not when he is around."}
{"text":"I've visited Pizza M twice now. I never knew this place existed until I attended an event in which pizza and apps were provided. I was able to try their most popular pizzas: sugar bear, the abbi, pear & brie, and mediterranean. All were fantastic. The sugar bear and the pear & brie were the best by far. I was so impressed, I came back for lunch a week later. 

The toppings are fresh and very high quality. I think the price of $15 for a 14\" pizza is especially great considering the the high quality. I liked that the crust was thin and more chewy than crispy. The crust didn't hold up as well leftover and became a serious jaw workout. 

They have a pretty good beer selection which was a pleasant surprise. The drink prices are also comparable to other locations. It's about $5 for a good beer which is normal and I'm happy to pay that price."}
{"text":"I went here because my friend told me about there being a pizza shop in downtown Urbana. Upon coming in, the atmosphere was pretty urban, industrial, and cool. I liked how everything was set up. Drawn in, I talked to the register guy working there who seemed to be busy for a minute before acknowledging me waiting. I went ahead and ordered the special per recommendation... the Black Dog chicken with carolina red barbecue sauce. Only two sizes, a 14'' and 10'', but the 10'' is gluten free. Why? That doesn't make sense to me... can't they roll the dough just smaller for a 10'' and no individual slices were available. Anyways, I went ahead and ordered the 14'' pizza for $15. I was told afterwards the wait time would be 25 minutes... which is a long time for a pizza that's not deep dish. Whatever... 
When I got the pizza, I was somewhat excited after the 25 minute wait. I bit into the pizza and it was quite tasty at first, but as I took a few more bites, I began to regret my purchase. It was quite bland and dry for a barbecue pizza, had a bunch of veggies which is cool and all, but I was expecting more barbecue and more chicken. Don't advertise it as a barbecue chicken pizza when there's twice as many veggies as there is chicken. There was also waaaay to much crust... I don't mind crust normally but after eating three slices my jaw started hurting from how much crust I had to chew through. Overall, I'm not impressed. Seems like a cool place to hang out, grab a coffee, but I'm probably not coming back for the pizza."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite pizza place of any I've had, even when comparing it to Minneapolis, Chicago, and St. Louis pizza places. My favorite is the vegetarian Kitchen Sink. The employees have always been friendly to me and those with me."}
{"text":"It has nice atmosphere, sort of coffeehouse, computer-reading room and eatery.  Very bright.  We are regulars and like the pizza a lot.  The main downer is that the cook/owner lurches around the place in a filthy sweaty shirt (not a sweatshirt - a sweat-soaked shirt).  

I guess it is hot in the kitchen, but it is disconcerting on several levels to see the cook look like a slob."}
{"text":"Gluten free pizza is far far better than any other gluten free pizza in town. Toppings are wonderful, fresh, flavorful and creative. Staff is absolutelywonderful. Beautiful space."}
{"text":"The best pizza you'll ever eat. The crust is perfectly crispy and the toppings abundant, local, and fresh. I love M's choice of bases (olive oil, tomato, etc) which perfectly compliment the cheeses and toppings. My favorite? The pear and brie. I don't think there could ever be a better pizza combo. 

They only take cash, and are only open on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights, so just keep that in mind. I think it's a good thing though. I treasure Pizza M that much more because of it. 

It may be more pricey than Dominos, but let's face it: Dominos in no way compares to Pizza M. It's worth every cent.

Rumor has it Pizza M might be getting their own place soon, and hopefully extend their hours (hopeful thinking). I can't wait!

Update*** 

Now Matt has his own store front. Pizza slices as well as a a full pie. What more can you ask for? Hands down, the best pizza place in town. Period."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I love Pizza M! It started at a local bakery and grew into its own brick and mortar location. My friends and I frequent this place throughout the week. Wednesday's are GREAT for trivia with Abbi and the pizza is an amazing complement. I would recommend the Abbi (a divine concoction topped with a fried egg), the Sugar Bear (sausage and maple syrups), or the Deluxe! 

Sharing a location, The Flying Machine Cafe is also great. They make a wonderful chai tea and mocha, and have a great assortment of vintage sodas, wines and beer. 

You cannot go wrong!"}
{"text":"The specialty pizzas ($15) are good. They are small/medium sized. They have a tasty selection of which it's hard to pick a favourite. Ingredients are fresh & locally sourced as much as possible. Pizza M shares a space with Flying Machine Coffee so you can get a drink to go with your food. The place mostly consists of a large galley (reservable back room for small events) with long tables & bench seating. It's a malleable space but the acoustics are terrible. It's usually loud & the sound echoes terribly, so it's not conducive of conversation or studying. However, the pizzas are tasty & the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"The man wearing a beanie behind the counter was very rude when we were first walked in...we ended up walking out after feeling very uncomfortable."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. We go often and there isn't a single pizza on the menu we don't love. The environment is bright, but intimate. It's a great place for groups and small tables alike. This is a great place to visit if supporting local business or the creation of delicious pizza is important to you. 

We also had our wedding reception here a while back. The owner was short staffed (someone didn't show for work) but they busted their butts to make sure we had a great experience. All of our guests loved the pizza - everyone still raves over the Abbi, the Pear and Brie, and the Sugar Bear. Pizza M is a great place to meet up with friends, go for a date, or host an event.

P.S. One of the other reviews on here said that the environment is cold, unwelcoming, and \"too hipster.\" I don't find that to be accurate. There all kinds of people here at any given time: hipsters, grad students, local patrons, families, etc. Another claimed about having to bus their own table. It's definitely more of a 'pizza parlor' and less of a sit-down restaurant. Yes you can bus your own tables but don't have to. Someone will come get your dishes if it's really too difficult to drop your plates in the bin on your way out the door. This is a casual dining experience with a casual atmosphere. I'm not sure what others are expecting. I feel like all of this is pretty clear when you walk in and shouldn't be a surprise to anyone."}
{"text":"Thought $4.50 was a little steep for a slice, seeing that you can get twice the quality for half the price at Papa Dels. Reminded me of school cafeteria pizza with a little better crust."}
{"text":"Love it. I'd highly recommend the sugar bear or the pizza m. I'm not sure why this place doesn't get more love. My one critique is that the crust can *sometimes* come out overdone. They need to stay on top of this because it really can make or break the pizza."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service and so rude. The women behind the counter was so terribly rude. Go anywhere else, don't go here. She was outright mean to my friend for no reason and had an attitude problem."}
{"text":"I made a Yelp account just so I could help Pizza M improve its rating, because I seriously don't understand how it doesn't have atleast four stars on here. I know its just Yelp but this is damn good pizza and I can't imagine not having it in my life.

Every staff member I have ever encountered has always been friendly and helpful. Their menu isn't extensive but it honestly doesn't need to be, they offer classics like Margherita pizza, single topping pizza if you're shy, and unique pizza like their pear and brie pizza and the abbi (it has fried egg on it, enough said).

And now that you can order through grubhub to have it delivered it has only gotten that much better. Finally, I can eat an entire pizza by myself without the public shame. It doesn't get any better than that."}
{"text":"I LOVE Pizza M's pizza! 

My goal is to try every pizza on the menu. So far, I've had The Abbi. Eggs and bacon on a pizza? What an awesome concept! I've also had another one I can't remember the name of that had artichoke, goat cheese, onion, tomato, and peppers and we added bacon. So delicious! Pizzas are $15, well worth the price!"}
{"text":"LOVE. THIS. PLACE. It is such a hidden gem in the Champaign-Urbana area. They have so many specialty pizzas that always come out super crunchy with really fresh tasting toppings. I don't think I've ever had a pizza here I didn't like. 

Their drinks are really good as well. Lactose intolerant folk be warned, they are very milky (though they can substitute for a lot of them.) This place has a really cool and trendy atmosphere, and the staff is always super nice. It's quite spacious and pretty good to chill and study at during the day. They do have night events sometimes, so I'd check for those before going."}
{"text":"Ice tea is awful!  Pizza has potential but the toppings were scant!  Our pizza was to have feta cheese...I expected more than the half teaspoon we received:(. Would like to see improvements in service."}
{"text":"The pizzas are generous and people generally leave you alone. I like coming here if I want to share food with friends and I do not want people bothering me the Abbie is good. They also created a special Filipino pizza for an event that had tocino on it and it was amazing. the owner is great and let us do a charity event to raise money."}
{"text":"Pizza M is awesome.  I find the negative reviews very perplexing, as the employee/owner I interacted with was very affable, and the pizza was delicious.

Also of note: they sell Cheerwine and a number of other delicious sodas.

You should go here."}
{"text":"What an awesome hidden spot! I'm really not sure what the proper word(s) to describe Pizza M are. Perhaps a Pizza/Coffee/bar/music \"collective\"? It certainly has a hipster-y vibe but was very warm and welcoming.

I actually heard about Pizza M from a professor and decided to take the girlfriend there after our long motorcycle ride. It was a Saturday at about 9pm and this place was jumping!

The inside is sweet. It's pretty modern, very clean and that night they also happened to have a live Jazz trio playing that night, too, which made it a really unique dinner for us.

We almost ordered a margerhia pizza but the cashier showed us a pizza they had special that night and after quickly reading the ingredients, we opted for the special instead and we were glad we did!

About 20 minutes later our pizza was delivered to our table. It looked delicious! The special was a variety of different toppings that paired unusually well together. It was a pesto base with tomatoes, onions, blue cheese crumbles, bacon, apples and maybe something else I don't remember. We didn't think apple would be good on a pizza, but this was amazing and we were so happy with our food. The pizza was about 14'' and honestly was enough for two very hungry people. But at Pizza M it seems the emphasis is on quality as opposed to quantity. They definitely nailed that, everything on our pie tasted fresh and delicious, it was worth the above average price.

Everyone seemed to have a glass of wine as they were watching the Jazz band, so my girlfriend got us a couple glasses. I wanted a pinot noir, but the bartender ran out after my glass was about half full, so he gave us a half glass on the house! The wine was good and reasonably priced.

Overall a fantastic experience here. I will certainly try to make it back before I graduate; if the coffee is as good as the pizza I'll have to definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"Ordering was cumbersome. They take your name and then you sit down. They come out and call your name. They need numbers. 

The woman working the register also brought out the pie. It was slow and we had to bus our own table. 

We ordered breakfast, pear, and special pizza. All but special pizza were incredibly bland. Add sausage to the special pizza and it's delicious. 

Also, should sell pizza by the slice but they don't."}
{"text":"Some might say, what is a gluten-free, dairy-free pizza anyway? I say, when you're at Pizza M, it's heaven and only $10. Thank you for welcoming me home."}
{"text":"I really like Pizza M. It's a dependable pizza place with more unique ingredients than your local Pizza Hut. I have always had great service there (except one minor carry out mixup that was quickly resolved) and they have some old timey bottled sodas which are a delight. Pizzas will run you about $15 on average but you get a good amount and it's always delicious and hot. Heads up there are no slices! It's a thin crust establishment so be creative and try something new every time you go. The pizza isn't great overnight but if you can eat it cold the next day, it's not a bad breakfast to go. I know they are also very welcoming to other events and have hosted many a dance party in their private event area. The space itself is very open seating and very well lit for studying, which many people do. The chairs are kinda uncomfortable but that may be because I have 90 minute meals. Overall, I agree with my fellow Yelpers that this is a diamond in the rough. I would suggest hopping on the 5EGreen from campus and grabbing a pizza from here. Bonus points if you carry out and go eat in beautiful Carle park!"}
{"text":"As I've continued to come here, I love what they're doing. The pizza quality has not slipped and it seems like they worked out a lot of the issues with the two different businesses occupying the same space. The employees are very helpful and professional. This summer, they've even offered ICE CREAM! and not your typical flavors. Tonight I had the chardonnay-strawberry ice cream which was absolutely delicious! It had a faint savory, almost cheesy taste and was like nothing I've ever tasted. Be patient with the employees. Sometimes, they dread ice cream orders since it means they have to go to the back cooler to scoop it out to order for customers.

Also, I tried the lunch slices for the first time and found it to be delicious! It's different than their standard pizza. It's more like a heavily topped focaccia. Today's special slice had kalamata olives and gorgonzola - delicious!"}

{"text":"One of my more favorite places for pizza. I've definitely enjoyed the pizzas I've tried, my fave still being the brie and pear (yum...to the yum!!). I've also ordered the Kitchen Sink which has a lot of random toppings. It came with their house-made sausage (delicioussss and so fresh!), and peppers, mushrooms and cheese. So great. I like the crust as well. The pizzas are priced at $15 and take about 20 minutes to make. I enjoy the freshness of the ingredients and the courteous staff members I've encountered!"}
{"text":"Restaurant review
This is a place that should advertise more. I have been in Champaign for over a year dealing with pizza from Papa Del and chain restaurants alike trying to find a good thin crust pizza with no avail. The recent Yelp event held here first of all opened my eyes to a pizza place in downtown. The pizza utilize unique fresh ingredients including sausage made in house. I was amazed by the selection of pizza including my favorite which was the Pizza M. It is a well hidden restaurant in the back of a coffee shop which is slightly confusing. They have to put up a larger sign to attract business and advertise more because it is quite a gem. Staff was super friendly and introduced you to each of the pizza's they had. This place easily beats the new Pizzeria Antica which touts the fire oven pizza. Crust is crunchy and stays that way even when you cut into the pizza. Overall quite an amazing selection and I will be back to try there other pizzas!

Pros: fresh ingredients, house made sausage, friendly staff

Cons: Somewhat hard to find as it is hidden behind the coffee shop, still cost more than chain pizzas

Hidden deals: Did not see any special deals, maybe the owner should also think about pizza special nights to pull in more people

{"text":"Decided to finally try out the pizza here and it did not disappoint! Pizza M is a fairly popular place and the coffee shop portion is often quite full with people. The pizza took about 35 minutes to come out, which was relatively quick. We got a half Mediterranean pizza and cheese. They'll bring the pizza right to where you are and it really is tasty. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The pear and Brie was amazing. We brought a large group of kids in and were given the backroom. The server back there was friendly and speedy. Great experience."}
