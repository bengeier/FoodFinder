{"text":"This place is awesome!! I looooooove Mexican food and this food is so fresh and delicious. It's located in the farmers market, so you know they are using high quality and local ingredients! 

I got the assorted tacos, which comes with 4 and has different meats in each one. One was beef, one was pork, one was chicken, and one was chorizo. The chorizo one was delicious and my favourite! I also got the refried beans which comes with some cheese on top and are so yummy with some tortilla chips. The lady working there gave me the tortilla chips for free as well as some fresh salsas to try. She was absolutely amazing and friendly, as well as the rest of the staff. 

All of that along with some Mexican mango soda, and you have a delicious authentically Mexican lunch :)"}
{"text":"Tried the tacos. I had one beef, one chicken and one carne asada. They were missing the flavour. Very dry and really just missing parts. The flavour just wasn't there. They were extremely expensive too as they were $4 per. Not worth it at all. I would not really recommend this place."}
{"text":"I had carnitas and buche and they were awesome!!! I never expected to had such an amazing Mexican dish in Canada. They were served with chile morita sauce and was great!!! I definitely coming back!!"}

{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! The best carnitas in town!! Get some extra salsa verde, you will need it."}
{"text":"On my neverending quest to find semi-decent (I had given up on decent and have lowered my standards accordingly - sorry Calgary, I say this with L-O-V-E: even the highest rated Mexican \"taquerias\" in this town, are nothing compared to some of the dive-y numminess elsewhere) Mexican food, and while trying to quell a grumbling belly, I came across Sabores in the Kingsland Farmers Market food court during the last few hours of Corn Fest. 

Despite being in a food court setting, Sabores takes your order, gives you a little placeholder that you take back to a table with you, and in a few minutes; a waitress brings you a plate of \"Holy Shit, did I really order that much food?!\" All that was missing was a little bottle of hot sauce with a wooden cap (or a man with a sombrero on it). 

While still more expensive than what I'm used to when it comes to Mexican nomz, it's actually very reasonably priced for Calgary. For that burrito behemoth and a bottle of Mango Jarritos, it came to about $13."}
{"text":"I really like Sabores. The meals are fresh, tasty and just the right amount of spicy (which for me is usually a-lot). The portions are out of control huge which means any lunch at Sabores usually is also my dinner. Friendly staff and good atmosphere."}
{"text":"If you're a taco lover then this place is a MUST. 

Taco Carnitas...5 stars. Simply the best shredded pork taco in town (and in most places)!!! LOADS of flavor from just the pork...you can taste the beautiful pork fat that helped tenderize the meat. The meat is not overly shredded, either...there are still small chunks of meat that add to the tenderness and taste. The pico de gallo is icing on the cake!"}
{"text":"Had al pastor taco here.
They use flour tortilla.
Served with a sliver of lime, and green salsa.

They also have apple soda :)"}
{"text":"Sabores is probably one of my most favorite Mexican food places in Calgary.

There is something about the small and welcoming atmosphere they have in the Market on Macleod. Their food feels like home and tastes very authentic, like how mom would have cooked it, it was full of love and care.

We ordered their mole enchiladas and enchiladas poblanas and both tasted great! They give you huge enchiladas with large helping of rice, chips, and refried beans on the side. Typing this all up is making me hungry! 

They also sell Mexican pop if you are interested in trying some. We tried the lime flavour and it was extremely sweet, not to my taste, but I'm sure people who have a sweet tooth will like it.

I would definitely recommend Sabores for anyone that loves or wants to try out some Mexican food. Next time we come I will definitely try their  tacos and burritos!"}
{"text":"The good news first.  
The service is excellent!  The lady taking the order is very helpful and friendly.  The guy doing the food prep (when he comes out) always has a smile on his face.  I assume they own the establishment and love their customers and it shows.  I almost feel bad for writing this next part...
Now the bad news.
Is there even ONE good Mexican place in Calgary???  I read some \"good\" reviews about this place and once again i am disappointed.  I used to live in California and did business in Texas and they have so many great Mexican restaurants there.  No wonder they're all so fat (especially Texas...hohhhly!).  But back to Sabores...
For a place which means flavors (sabores), the Tortilla soup I ordered was almost completely devoid of it.  It is not hard to make a good soup for crying out loud.  It's all in the stock.  This tasted like a watered down version of the stock that comes in a box.  The tacos I ordered were just so  plain-o plain-o.  Again, not much flavor,  Sad...
The salsas tasted like store bought at best.  I gave them 2 stars because the lady was so nice, BUT I don't think I will be coming back here again.  Next... (Hope springs eternal eh?)."}
