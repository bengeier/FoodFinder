{"text":"Hours of operation are odd as most of the time I have driven by this place, it is closed.  We managed to find it open during a recent car show.  Sandwiches were made fresh and heated for us.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  I would consider coming here more often if the place had evening hours."}
{"text":"Heard about how wonderful this place is so I had to try it.  Took two of my kids for lunch (not open for dinner).

I got a small reuben & it was pretty good.  My two kids each split a sandwhich and really loved it.  I thought it was a little pricey considering we got two sandwiches & 3 cans of soft drinks & our bill was $20.

It was good, but I would probably frequent it again if it was easier to get to and had later hours.  Parking in our little downtown isn't bad, I am just used to walking up to where I want to go.

They had two small tables outside so be sure to grab one on your way in, if available.

Should mention how friendly & great the staff was!"}
{"text":"This is the little brother of the world famous Diamond Deli in downtown Akron.I had the ruben today, same delicious homemade cornbeef that they serve downtown. Of course the family offers the same friendly service. Breakfast sandwiches. No seating but there are plenty of picnic tables provided on the walking mall that the resturant is located on. Whether you're a fan of the original or have never been you will not be disapointed."}
