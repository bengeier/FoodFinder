{"text":"I took my family on mother day dinner we have got an excellent experience the food and service was amazing"}
{"text":"I saw a few reviews where people were disappointed that they had to pay for their leftover sushi, and that the sushi wasn't fresh. It's a buffet people.

The sushi is actually quite good for a buffet, and so is the selection. They also offer items other than sushi, so if you have someone who dislikes sushi in your group, they'd probably find something to enjoy. The staff are busy, but when my family asked for anything they helped us immediately. The service was really quick, bringing out 40 pieces in 5-10 minutes.

The only thing I personally found to be a problem was the seating arrangements. There isn't much privacy and it's difficult not to bang knees with your compatriots under the round tables. Space for food is also somewhat of an issue if you have a big group.

The sushi isn't the best, but it's certainly not bad. If you like sushi and want to gorge yourself for $21-25 then you'll probably like this place. Tables with 5 or more will have to pay a 15% tip, so keep that in mind."}
{"text":"Great dining experience. Nice place, friendly service and yummy food! All you can eat is affordable at lunch time and the menu is full of diverse dishes. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The place looks very chic.

The hot and sour soup is very good :) it's one of my favorite soups hihi.

The sushi and makis are arverage for ayce sushi places. The rice in the nigiris is overwhelming but it is expected. The menu is limited, but the salmon sashimis were good enough.

I live downtown so it is far, but for weekdays the price is decent I think it was 21$ plus tax and tips."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi and the pad thai was WOW I almost cried it was So good!! :) and Really fast delivery too"}
{"text":"We went opening night, the food was great (all kinds of sushi, etc), the service was very good.  All in all we loved it.  The only downfall is the price during the week is a bit expensive when you can go to a buffet and get sushi for less. We will certainly go back again."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with great service!  Always coming by to refill your glass of water.  The sushi is great however some days it doesn't taste as fresh.  Their side orders are awesome though! Can't get enough of that General Tao."}
{"text":"Lovely restaurant with a great ambiance.  Nice choices of sushi and the best General Tao Chicken in town.   I have been many times and will definitely be returning"}
{"text":"The food was below average. Your typical take out. The prices were high and the amount you got was pretty small. I would not recommend this for take out."}
{"text":"Our new favorite restaurant. La Perle has lost us as their customers. 
Hasu has everything. All you can eat brought to your table. Great sushi. Great  Szechwan. Good service. Good food."}
{"text":"The food is very good. The personal are very friendly and warm. Best place to eat sushi. I have been to few sushi place and this one is by far the best."}
{"text":"Enjoyed lunch on Good Friday . Place was much busier then in the past . Excellent service . Salt & pepper shrimps were excellent but fiery hot which was odd since it was the only dish with ANY heat . Standard all you can eat sushi place  . Really enjoyed the included mango ice cream ."}
{"text":"I'd strongly advise anyone looking to eat at this place to read my entire review.

Tl;dr: As far as all-you-can-eat sushi restaurants go, this managed to be below average. Not Kanda quality (so basically I didn't get flat out food poisoning) but definitely below average. Which basically means, you won't spend a couple of hours on the toilet BUT you'll feel like you could have spent your money better if you're a lil' broke student like me.

Atmosphere/Setup: 3/5

The atmosphere was definitely quite average. It was a typical restaurant with a nice view on the parking lot so I could really admire all those rusty car side panels. If you are a person that gets cold easily, don't come here during the winter because all they use are crappy heat lamps for the whole restaurant. And not the good ones either, it's the garbage 40$ 2 out of 5 star amazon ones that would even get snobbed by WalMart. I'm very unsure if they have an actual heating system.

Cleanliness: 4/5

The place was clean. There isn't much to say about that. the carpet flooring was in pretty good shape, the tables and chairs don't look chipped, etc.

Food: 1/5

I have a LOT to say about the food. Buckle up and hang on tight because if you like this place, you're definitely going to hate me.

First and foremost, I tasted about half of the all-you-can-eat menu and I could not find a single product that was equal or superior to Sushi Saint-Jean apart from the philadelphia sushi. The selection is also vastly inferior. The ice creams are not mentioned on the menu and soft drinks are not included in the price.

The dragon eyes are cold. Almost every bit of sushi I ordered was cold, felt under-cooked and  tasteless. The shrimp were buttered up and disgusting. It's as if they marinated them for 2 days in margarine. The salmon felt old and dry.

They also use this really greasy rice (which you can spot yourself as they almost look like shiny beads) so you fill up faster. This also ensured that rice doesn't stick properly to each other so careful if you're not adept with cheap plastic chopsticks they provide because you'll end with a mess in your plate. Furthermore, to fill you up faster, some sushi rolls and handrolls are randomly filled with panko bread crumbs. Two very cheap tactics easily spotted by anyone with a critical mind but that can easily dupe the average consumer.

WARNING: I have VERY strong suspicions they freeze old fish instead of getting it fresh. You probably are questioning the validity of my accusation, which is fair. The clue was the dragon eye sushi. The exterior was fried but the fish was still cold. That's a HUGE sign that they freeze-fry it. And one can only guess how long it was frozen for.

While I was there, I heard the exact same complaint made by another customer seated about 3m away from our table. The waiter told her off. Told her it's how it's cooked. Which is not. It's a lie. Dragon eye is not supposed to be cold. It's supposed to be fried.

Also, who the hell fills cheese sticks with cream cheese instead of Mozzarella? Sacrilege!

Service:3/5

The waiters and waitresses were pretty nice but they lost points because they kept forgetting orders we placed. My friend, in the end, never got his chicken teriyaki. It's a sad but true story.

Also lost points because of how they treated the customer mentioned above.

Honestly I might not be the best to assess service. My friend is much better at getting a feel for when a waiter is \"rude\". I don't care if the waiters don't say hello or some other social non-sense. To me, I'm here for the all-you-can-eat buffet. I don't expect anyone to roll a red carpet for my ass just so I can sit there with my friends in sweatpants and get fat off of rice, fish and sauces for an hour and a half. 

As long as a waiter/waitress does these three steps:
A. Get my order to the chef
B. Ensure my order is there and nothing is forgotten
C. Get my food from the kitchen to my table

That's a 5 out of 5. And they sadly failed it.

Price: 3/5

Honestly, it's not worth the price. Just go to Sushi St-Jean.

I guess it could kind of maybe possibly be worth it if you're a girl on those 1/2 off Thursdays. It's easier to deal with shit quality when paying only 13$ for an all-you-can-eat but it's definitely not worth the cash for frozen fish if you don't."}
{"text":"We are regular here. Specially on Thursday. Ladies night. 
So fresh and so delicious."}
{"text":"First time was today at lunch. I was I impressed by the decor. The lunch menu had a good selection and the service for the most part was attentive.

The sushi and wok prepared food is excellent.

This place is hands down so much better then Kanda where everything looks good but tastes the same.  Here not only is everything fresh but the chefs put their flair I to every dish.

I would recommend Hasu to anyone who normally doesn't like all you can eat.  You will be pleasantly surprised!

10/28/2016 - It's been a while since I've been here but it has only gotten better. Great service, decor and excellent food. Even the ice cream for desert was good."}
{"text":"Do not eat here! The service was terrible, we ordered sushi and waited so long for them. We tried calling a waiter, making eye contact with him and even raising our hands to ask how much longer it would take. After 45 mins he finally came to our table to ask if everything was ok, we told him that we were missing our order. He then told us that it wouldn't be long and left. A few mins later he came back with a new paper and asked us what we ordered in the first place because apparently they lost our order... Like I said, terrible service, do not come here."}
{"text":"Excellent servIce, and really good aNd diverse food for the price :) I higHly recommend it !!!!!!!!!!!!!11!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is good but not great. The presentation of the rolls are not great. 4 rolls of the same flavor all have different heights. The soup is lukewarm at best. The place looks good but I'm not there for the look. For the price I can find better sushi. Glad I tried it but not sure I'll go back."}
{"text":"Few choices, and not fresh.  No real need to read past this sentence.

I'm going to be feeling guilty after I post this review.  

Came here because a friend had said this place is really good and better than the other all-you-can eat sushi in the area.

The food choices are limited - very few sushi to choose from I.e. no where did I see eel.  Doesn't taste or feel fresh - the avocado rolls seem to be pre-made the day before and was just pulled out of the fridge.  It could also be because we arrived just when they opened for lunch on a Saturday, and they could have a different menu for dinner?

It felt like a Canadian Chinese restaurant that has a sushi counter.

My only found love for this place is Tom.  What a sweetheart.  He served us and we recognized him from Jade Palace.  He is a local celebretity for those who grew up on the West Island.  If it wasn't for seeing him again after so many lost years, then the total experience would have been a loss.  It's because of this that I feel bad for not ever wanting to return here.

If you'll be dining here, my recommendation is to fill up on the peanut butter dumplings."}
{"text":"Terrible service. My daughter and I went here for lunch. The restaurant was very quiet to start with but service was awful. They brought dishes out 20-25 minutes apart so our appetites were cut. Disorganized and not friendly at all. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Had some friends take us here to experience our first ayce sushi. Came on a Sunday for lunch: no line up and the place wasn't packed, many tables available. Hostess was very curt and sat us quickly. 

Menu was on the table with a pencil to fill it out. There are three parts to the menu: sushi/sashimi, appetizers (soup, salad, etc), cooked items. 

TIPS:
- Don't order everything at once, otherwise the waiters/tresses will slow around bringing you the rest of your order. They do keep an eye on how much food is left on your table.
-Order just enough for everyone to try things out first (you get 4 pieces of sushi in each order), that way you're not stuck with lots of uneaten food and get charged extra for the waste (you can't take home leftovers).
-Once you know which items you like, ask for another paper menu then order another round.
- Before you finish eating the food that is on your table, order another round. Repeat until you're stuffed.

The male waiters were very friendly, efficient and accommodating. Reasonably priced for the variety of things you can get: sushi, sashimi, soup, salad, appetizers, and a number of different cooked items. Not everything on the menu is good and the rice in their sushi is a little too firm for my liking but there were a number of things we did enjoy (see pics for recommendations)."}
{"text":"This is semi decent restaurant. I would go back on a Thursday night when it is half-price for ladies, but on a regular priced night, I would definitely not choose this place over Sushi St. Jean or Sushi Palace
. 
The decor was nice and the dining area looked clean but the bathroom was horrible! Toilet paper everywhere (except in the dispenser!) and toilet scrub brush in the middle of the floor. It smelt bad and the stalls were covered in fingerprints! It takes a lot for me to be grossed out by a bathroom, but I wouldn't use it!

The sushi was so-so. The rice was inconsistent, some was undercooked and some right on. The fish tasted fresh, though, so the sashimi and nigiri were great! 

We only had a couple of the Asian dishes and those were really good! I would definitely order more non-sushi dishes if i were to go back. We had the Pad Thai which was pretty tasty, as well as the crispy chicken and shrimp which was in a delicious, sweet white sauce. The tempura was nice and crispy, too.

The service was decent, except my water glass stayed empty for so long, which is a huge per peeve of mine!

Basically, I'd go back on a Thursday for the ladies' night special, but not on a regular night.  They don't take reservations on Thursdays, though, so plan to go early or wait for a seat if you go later on."}
{"text":"Decent AYCE - it's in the spot where Pizza Hut used to be, in the same plaza as Cavallaro and Baskin Robbins. 

We were there on a recent weekend early evening - place was about half full the whole time we were there. It's clean, lots of space, and nice sleek decor (they have these beautiful flower petal hanging lights). They have a wide variety of sashimi, maki (different sizes too), appetizers and soups, \"from the wok\" (very Chinese-inspired), and some house specials. 

The sashimi is fresh (the 'oil' fish is actually quite good - reminded me of a buttery fish and not too fishy like mackerel sometimes is) but the pieces are small - though there is no limit which is great! The maki we tried was ok - not terrible but better than one would expect from an AYCE. In case it's unclear to you, as it was to me, Japanese beans refer to edamame (I mistakenly thought they would be string beans, but they were none the less still tasty). Chicken wings were delicious, with a thin crispy shell from being deep-fried. Pan-fried dumplings and tempura were good too.

I found that the dishes that were more of the Chinese variety were just ok, very much \"Canadianized\" Chinese dishes. Don't bother with the wonton soup... the skins are super thick and when I took one apart, there was just a smidgen of meat in it (about the size of a pea, I'm not even joking). Hot and sour soup is not very spicy at all. Grilled calamari sounded good but unfortunately it turned out incredibly chewy. Beef tataki is also not what I'm used to from a regular Japanese restaurant - it was cooked and I was pretty sure it's supposed to be a raw beef dish. Beef with sesame is also skippable - deep fried beef chunks in a sauce that wasn't very sesame-ish. 

Green tea is extra (about $1.75 per person), but ice cream to finish off the meal is included. I found that a lot of dishes didn't come out but this seems to be common to all AYCE places. Overall, I'd go back."}
{"text":"Encore une fois excellent. Sushi, wok tout était frais et servi rapidement pour le lunch. La seule faiblesse au menu est les dumplings à la sauce aux arachides. Fade et la sauce est liquide.  Mais pour le reste c'est vraiment bon pour des sushis à volonté."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with family and family friends from out of town as there wasn't a lot of choices for restaurants on the evening that we went.

Hasu Sushi et Wok is located in a parking mall and on the evening that we went, there was plenty of parking available. It was also snowing.

It was my first time here and as all you can eat sushi places, I thought that it was okay. It wasn't exceptional/great but it wasn't bad either.

We arrived and were informed that due to the number of people in our party, the tip would automatically be added to the bill (which is standard for most restaurants).

We ordered items from the paper. I liked the hot & sour soup, the General Tao chicken, the sashimi, and the tempura shrimp.

For dessert, we each had a scoop of ice cream. I would have preferred more scoops but they were closing."}
{"text":"Great food, fast service and great price. What more can you ask for? You will not regret coming here at all."}
{"text":"Perfect tasty, friendly place to enjoy sushi and Szechuan foods=Hunan dumplings RuLe, also Thursday nights 2/1 for Ladies, which, apparently, includes MOI= yummy"}
{"text":"As far as all you can eat sushi restaurants go, Hasu was a great experience. The lunch special is very affordable, and it offers a varied selection of sushi and grill options. If you are looking to grab lunch in the West Island, then Hasu is worth a try. Hasu would be a great place to grab lunch with some friends or family. The wait staff is very professional; they are quick to take your orders and top up your water. 

I wish I could say more about the food except to say it's what you would expect from a buffet. I will say it is the best all you can eat sushi I have had (cannot say the same for the grill options) . Hasu does what every all you can eat should: have you enjoy stuffing your face without breaking the bank!"}
{"text":"Fabuleux
Nous sommes trois aujourd'hui à visiter cet endroit 
Jean pierre est venu déjà et nous fais découvrir ce bijou de sushi 
Plein à craquer à 2hrs de l après midi 
On se régalés et C est
All you can eat pour 13$ pp
Incroyable"}
{"text":"First time was tonight and I was very impressed with the quality. Same price as Kanda but nicer menu. Everything was delicious. Kids even had fruit sushi with chocolate sauce. Kids 4-10 are 1/2 price."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: It's a nice little modern restaurant. Quite clean and quiet.

FOOD: Food is decent! Typical all-you-can-eat style and quality, nothing too too special. Their chicken wings were pretty good though! Some of their hot foods are a little bit too salty in my opinion but it didn't ruin my meal. I would say that other AYCE places have more options in their menu though... Overall, I'd come back here again, it's not a bad spot. 

PRICE: Standard prices for an all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant. What's nice is that they offer a ladies night on Thursdays. It's not much but it's the only sushi restaurant I know that does this.

SERVICE: The service here is always good! The waiters do what they have to do and are pretty friendly. No complaints here."}
{"text":"The food was good yet the service was terrible !! We got there the moment it opened  at 5 on a Thursday which is half off for ladies. We ordered our food which took forever to come, we kept asking for another paper so we could order again and they never brought it . When they finally did it took even longer to get that food. We arrived at 5 and left at 8 due to this service. When we paid I asked for my Change back and they just kept it . I didn't complain I just left since it was only 3$ but I was still very unimpressed. Don't think I'm going back anytime soon and it's right around the corner from my house."}
{"text":"Ordered the pad thai and it was a weak approximation of what a pad thai should actually be. Very weak, wrong noodles, very little chicken/shrimp. Just a 10$ plate of noodles.

I also got the spring rolls which were actually not that bad. They give 10% off for takeout."}
{"text":"My favourite all you can eat sushi in the west island! Is it the best tasting sushi out there? No. But it's GREAT for all you can eat, everything is very fresh, and there is something to say about the people who work there. They are all so incredibly sweet!!!! Very quick on refilling water, very attentive, and always smiling and receptive when you thank them. Hard to find at most all you can eat restaurants because of the fact that most servers just bring the food rather than verbally taking order. I say this compared to their west island rival, sushi-st jean where they don't even look at you. Does this place have ipads like they do? No. Does it offer as many items? No. Still a MILLION times better!!!!!! Restaurant is HUGE too, i've never had to wait to sit. Thursday nights are ladies nights, where one of two gets 50% off. Because my friend and I had separate bills, they gave us 25% off each without us having to ask. Just an overall great place, crave it ALL the time too!!"}
