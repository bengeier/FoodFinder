{"text":"We didn't order sushi because we want to eat something hot. So, we ordered the Pork Don Katsu and Beef and Scallop Teriyaki. They were awesome! And also, the waiter and waitress were very nice and friendly!"}
{"text":"This place got a good recommendation from the Hilton hotel next door where we were staying for the night.  Food tasted fine, but less than two hours later I got a raging case of what could only be food poisoning.  I was sick for about 48 hours before I could keep anything more than Saltines down.  Service was OK, decor was nothing to rave about, but that's not why I usually choose restaurants.  I did observe some questionable practices after we had finished eating that gave me some insight later on as to why I may have gotten so sick:  I watched a waiter continue to wipe off tables with a dirty washrag even though he had just dropped on the floor.  A staff person making sushi was checking his phone for texts between making rolls.  Another waiter went from eating (pulling a bone out of his mouth), to running a credit card though, to returning that card to the patron, and back to eating without stopping to clean his hands.  I've waited tables and worked in restaurant kitchens, so I know that anyone can have a momentary lapse in judgement when it comes to staying clean / sanitary.  However, later on when I was draped over the toilet bowl for the ninth time at 4am, it made me think that if they have no qualms about doing this in front of their customers, lord only knows what was going on with the food in the kitchen."}
{"text":"We went to this place several times and order multiple different dishes. The sashimi is overpriced considering its quality. We paid over $60 to eat shredded radish rather have sashimi. Got little over 20pieces of thinnest sashimi at this place. I do not expect  the best sashimi quality in the Midwest but I would rather get frozen tuna from the grocery. As a big fan of rolls and sushi, I would try somewhere else on campus or in downtown.

Also they share kitchen with the Asian supermarket next to. Sanitation is awful for both place. Ever since I notice this, I never go back."}
{"text":"I never considered eating here until my 10-year-old suggested it, because it is rather unimpressive from the outside. But I was pleasantly surprised by the food. Best sushi in Champaign-Urbana, without a doubt. I really enjoyed everything I tried."}
{"text":"Best sushi place in Champaign.  The sushi is not excellent (unavoidable in a place like this) but is still very good and served at a reasonable price.  Great service as well.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is conducive to conversation and makes it a good place to meet up. Fair-to-Good quality sushi at normal prices, though there are lunch combos which give a good amount of sushi for the price point. Service was responsive, though the wait for food was a bit longer than I would have liked. Overall, OK."}
{"text":"This is gotta be my favorite Japanese joint in Chambana! I love how the place isn't really located in a very commercial area.. which makes the place a true hidden gem and you gotta look for it. 

The place is small, gives you that at home feel for some reason. The waitress is extremely sweet and nice, so does the other staff. Rice quality is OK, they really hold the fish/shrimp and veggies together better than other japanese joints where their rice don't hold the content that very well. Sushi may take awhile if there are a lot of people since there's only 1 sushi chef, but very worth the wait. (Last time me and my sister went there, there were actually 2 of them. So maybe that will help the wait lol)

Another favorite thing about this restaurant is how they give you free stuff on certain days. We got free seaweed salad, miso soup, tempura banana, and even a 6 pc sushi roll from the chef on different days! They got the best mochi ice cream ever, extremely cold but very good. Their fried rice is addicting for some reason, very different from all the stuff I've tasted.

Teppan grill is good, although it seems like they kept changing the portion everytime we go there. Now when they serve the rice, they put it on the plate upside down when I really prefer it on the small bowl so I can \"cup\" it with my chopstick easily. I haven't tried their Korean items but will someday!

I will always come back to this place and I can't wait to take my BF from Frisco here! :)"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place the couple of times I've been there -- quiet, friendly, high-quality ingredients, and ZERO pretension. Some observations:

1. Don't expect thick, sugary teriyaki sauce; this place is more like Teppanyaki -- simple, healthy, but still YUM. 

2. Sushi is quite good, but sushi rice isn't quite sticky enough. You don't get the level of mechanical stability or presentation (or pretension) of Maruya in SF, but that isn't the point of this place!  

3.  Bulgogi is top-notch -- not quite as good as my mother-in-law's, but still really good!

Given the price, 5 stars overall."}
{"text":"Sweetie's udon noodles with tempura were excellent. The sushi was like grocery store sushi, which is kind of not unexpected, as this is central Illinois and not some coastal metropolis. However, paying coastal metropolis prices for grocery stores sushi was a little much. I'd say 2.5 for the sushi; sweetie rounded up to four for the excellence ot the udon."}
{"text":"Yellowfin is one of my two favorite sushi places in CU. The prices are fair and the sushi is very good! It's a little hard to find the place as it's attached to an Asian grocery store on the side of a larger grocery store's parking lot, but it's worth looking for. Everyone that I've recommended it to has been happy with it! I only have two complaints and they've got nothing to do with the food. The dining area is pretty much a big box with lots of hard surfaces and no real sound dampening, so when it gets crowded it can get pretty loud. Also, one Friday about 8 of us went there for lunch and the place was packed and it appeared that only 2 people were working there. It took about an hour from when we were seated until everyone's food had arrived at the table. Fortunately we had the time but if we hadn't that would have been bad.  But if you're looking for sushi in CU- I recommend it!"}
{"text":"As the 3-star rating reflects, this place is A-OK. Not the best, but okay.

I went here on the recommendation of a friend. I've frequently been to Sakanaya on Green Street for sushi though since Sakanaya has been consistently good. 

When we went in, the decor was nice and clean. Very modern and Asian styled. We were immediately greeted by the waitress. It was a Saturday afternoon and the place wasn't very busy, only 2 other tables were filled. After being seated, we looked over the menus. A lot of the items seemed fairly priced, comparable to Sakanaya's prices, probably cheaper. 

The service was good. She gave us free bites of appetizers even though we didn't order any and free dessert (watermelon slices). She was very attentive and refilled our water when it was low. She definitely earned a hefty tip.

The food was okay, which is why I brought it to the 3 star level. I ordered a sushi entree along with the New York roll and my friend got the bulgogi. The bulgogi was as good as any. The sushi had too much wasabi. The roll was slightly messy too, not neat and tight. 

If you're looking for a quick bite and for okay Asian food, I would go here. So long as you're not looking to wait at the long lines at Sakanaya, this would be my second choice."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times in the past year. Top-notch service, outstanding sushi. Thank you Yellowfin. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Best Japanese restaurant in town. Great food at reasonable price!
Will return soon!"}
{"text":"I must start out by saying that this would have been a 4 star review had they not served us pumpkin soup that tasted like an ashtray with a splash of pumpkin. It was very sweet that they would give us free pumpkin soup, however I would much rather have never ever tasted it. I might have paid them not to give it to me had I known.

That had me worried, but my worries dissipated when my shumai arrived with spring greens in this amazing sauce for $4.45. They were amazing, shrimp dumplings with just a tiny hint of oniony flavor. I ended up putting in a second order. 

I was also happy when my crispy shrimp roll arrived. I was nervous about spicy mayo as I HATE MAYONNAISE but it was delicious. They don't overload it w/mayo and the shrimp were great and the tempura crisps were awesome. 

After asking for our check, we were surprised to get a free dessert of tempura bananas and what i think was a tangerine but could have been a fresh mandarin orange? Again the sauce was awesome and so was the tempura. Plus, it was a tempura banana for pete's sake! I would have paid for this dessert.

The food came out very quickly as compared to other sushi restaurants in town and would have been darn near perfect without the free pumpkin ash tray soup. (As a former smoker, I'm not exaggerating. If you want to lick an ash tray then have a bite of pumpkin you've got the idea of the soup).  

The location is sneaky. Google it if you don't know the area, totally worth what I paid."}
{"text":"Had lunch box. Like the mix of various foods. Delicious and healthy. Not very expensive."}
{"text":"The sushi is pretty decent for the Chambana area. Every time I've been there it has always been really empty, but that could be because I feel like most people do not know it exists. They give you a little dessert after, which I personally didn't like, but it was a nice gesture."}
{"text":"We had lunch at Yellowfin while visiting Champaign for the day. The storefront and interior don't inspire, but service and the sushi were both okay. A solid option, but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Great meal at lunch. No crowd in the middle of day! Had two rolls and udon noodles. Great taste with everything. Udon noodle serving size was more than enough for one person. Staff was very attentive."}
{"text":"I was waffling between a 4 and a 5 on this place out of the 3 times I've been here, but last night really pushed me to a 5! We came for a birthday party (we had a reservation for 6.. but it wound up being 8 and they accommodated us with no questions asked.. +1!) at around 6 on a Saturday, and there were only 2 other tables seated in the restaurant. Service started out a little shaky (our waiter was quite young), but nothing to complain about, really. Once we were all seated and had our orders placed, the evening just went really smoothly (which is really how parties at restaurants should be, I think). Though the rolls took a while to come out (we all ordered sushi in one form or another), we were sent out first a round of complimentary miso soup, and then trays of beautifully presented banchan (or Japanese food presented in banchan style). Our sushi came out pretty much all at the same time (though the waiter forgot one of my friend's second roll order until the end). I've only had the sushi here, so I can't speak for the hot food, but it is very fresh tasting and has clean flavor profiles. It seems to be that the majority of the rolls are dominated by fish and veggies rather than cream cheese/tempura style rolls, which is a nice break from some of the other restaurants in town. In my opinion, the rolls are on the pricey side ($6 for a simple maki to avg $13 for a 'special'), but I come from the land of cheap fish, so Yellowfin is competitive for the market in town. Finally, the chef sent out some tempura bananas topped with mango sauce and caramel. If you've not had a tempura banana, you're really missing out! 
I guess what impressed me the most was 1) how seamless the service integrated with the table's needs and 2) the effort put into the presentation and quality of the food. We were able to enjoy our night out without having to worry too much about really anything.. everything just flowed. The sushi was beautifully presented, with beautiful pieces of fish as well as intricately carved garnishes.
Bottom line: When a sushi craving hits any day other than a Sunday or Monday, I'll be headed to Yellowfin"}
{"text":"I had always been a 5 star fan of yellowfin, until one day.

I am probably one of the more tolerant restaurant customers giving servers, and restaurants the benefit of the doubt.  It's true that sometimes servers have bad days and are grumpy, and that's no problem, we've all been there.  There are also sometimes mistakes in food, and likewise, a chef or sushi chef could be having a bad day.

Still... when I was serve edamame in my lunch bento... and there were literally maggots coming out of the edamame... i was pretty horrified.  It was definitely one of those situations where you know the food is old.  The edamame was lifeless, brown, old.  And to my surprise, there were maggots in it having at it.

So being as tempered as possible, I alerted the server who apologized and took it away.  I was expecting one of two things... 1, the server (or owner) will come to the table, apologize, and comp my meal.  2, nothing will happen until I receive the check, and the meal will be comped on there with some kind of apology note.

By the time the check came, neither of the two happened.  Giving the restaurant one more chance to make right their wrong, I politely asked if I could get my meal comped since there were maggots in my food.  The server responded politely that the owner said there was no way for anyone to know there were maggots in the edamame.  Even though the edamame was all pretty much opened up with maggots coming out of them when it reached the table in the first place.

So... there you go, I gave every chance for them to make right their wrong.  Suffice it to say that getting maggots in your food is a totally unacceptable situation, they took it 3 steps too far by doing nothing about it before the check, on the check, or after the check.  By principle alone, and from fear that the rice, or even fish are likely aging beyond their safe tolerance levels, yellowfin gets a 0 star if I could give them one for committing egregious health code violations, and donig nothing about it."}
{"text":"Have been here twice. I ordered sushi once. The other time I wasn't in the mood and just wanted some teriyaki. The food wasn't bad either time, but I don't think it's a good value because of how expensive it is. A teriyaki combo which comes with salad and miso soup, is $18-22. Add in tax and tip and you're basically looking at around $25 for a plate of chicken teriyaki with rice. Again, I don't have complaints about the quality, but it's no better than chicken teriyaki you can get at various other places around town for less than half the price.

Same thing about the sushi. You're looking at $19-22 for the sushi combos which come with 7-9 pieces (plus California roll) or 12 pieces of sushi (without roll). Nigiri sushi pieces range from $4 to $7, with my favorites like unagi being around $6. That's more expensive than I'm willing to pay. I think Sakanaya is a better deal."}
{"text":"Although Japanese cuisine is far from my favorite ,  I do like Yellowfin a lot.  Their sushi lunches are affordable and good.  I always get the vegetarian plate and it comes with California rolls, wasabi, seaweed, and tempura vegetables. They serve soda by the can, which is a drag because I usually like one refill on my pop and I like the taste of fountain drinks better. I also could live without the loud contemporary Christian music which always seems to be playing.  (I have nothing against Christian music but I don't like loud music while I'm eating.)

 A nice cafe if you're in the mood for it."}
{"text":"After having lived in L.A. for so long and having had great sushi restaurants there on every corner, I was very apprehensive about finding a good sushi place here in Champaign. However, I ate at Yellowfin after reading the reviews here on Yelp, and was not disappointed. Sushi was super good, and the roll selection was extensive, although I think they charge a little too much for their specialty rolls. All in all, though, it was great, and I'd definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"By a strange set of circumstances, I ended up going here three times in less than a week.  So I got to try a lot of different things.  In short: rolls are great, nigiri is okay, bulgoogi is good but a little pricey.

Overall, it's a solid place.  I still like Sushi Kame just a little better, but it's a lot closer than it used to be.  

The rolls (maki) are the way to go here - they're really good, and there's some clever combinations.  The ume jiso is a sour paste, mint, and cucumber - it's awesome, the sour flavor is extremely intense and unlike any other sushi roll I've had.  The crazy roll is really good, too, and so is the unagi.  The tempura squid is also tasty.  The prices are pretty reasonable definitely in line with most of the other sushi places in C-U, and cheaper than Ko-fusion.  It's nice that they have a good selection of different entrees - even people who aren't crazy about raw fish can find something to eat here.

I do not recommend the nigiri (where you get a piece of fish on top of a little \"cake\" of pressed rice) so highly.  My girlfriend and I split a Sushi special and the amount of wasabi on some of the rolls was overwhelming.  I like wasabi, but there shouldn't be so much on the nigiri when it comes out that your sinuses burn and your eyes tear up.  It really overwhelms the flavor of the fish at that point.  At first we thought it was because they were so busy, but a friend got the same thing on our second visit, and there was still too much wasabi.  Also, though the sushi special gives you a lot of pieces for the price, there were some repeats - 2 shrimp, and 2 tilapia, which I think are some of the cheaper fish.  Neither was all that flavorful.  Because of this, I think Sushi Kame is still better when it comes to nigiri.

The bulgoogi is good, and comes out with veggies - looked like carrots, zucchini, mushrooms, onions.  However, at $14 it seems a little pricey.  I didn't have it, but another friend got the teriyaki chicken, and the portion was very large.

They do some special things like bring out complementary seafood pancakes before the meal, and desserts like tempura bananas and oranges.  That is nice.  

Service really depends on who's working and how busy they are.  It's generally not really fast - I only saw the one sushi chef working when I was there - so that's something to be prepared for.  One friend was there for her birthday, and they brought out little candles stuck in wasabi for her, so that was a nice touch.

If you like sushi and you stick with the rolls, you'll get the most out of this place.  I recommend the rolls pretty highly - they're probably the best I've had in town, and like I said, prices are reasonable. 

They're also one of the few sushi or Asian restaurants open on Monday, which is nice to know when your week is off to a bad start and you really want a sushi fix."}
{"text":"I've been going to Yellowfin as my \"sushi place\" (once every 2-3 weeks) for about a year. Initially, I was just happy to have an option that wasn't incredibly overpriced and over-focused on fancy tempura-laden rolls. Simple sushi is where its at, and its what they do well.

Unfortunately, the quality of their food has only gone down, and after tonight I'm not going to be taking my business there anymore. 

We got into the restaurant around 6:50pm. Not peak dinner-time, but still kind of crowded in the small space. There was ONE waiter working the 6-7 tables there, and he was clearly being run ragged. He provided decent customer service given his situation, and was definitely handling it as well as he could.

No amount of customer service can make up for crappy food and unsatisfying portions, though. The \"combo\" platters are little more than some type of protein (shrimp, scallops, chicken, beef, or tofu), and some vegetables thrown into a wok that might have had soy sauce in it at some point during the day. No kidding, I don't think there was even teriyaki sauce on there...just soy sauce. I can, and do, make better stir fry at home. 
Their sushi is small, but they serve it nice and cold, which is a step up from other restaurants in the area. The fish is of decent quality (re: it won't kill you), but today I noticed that the portions of fish had gotten even tinier over the last few months. I think the chef was slicing the fish in half lengthwise, it was so thin!

They do not include soup and salad with your meal, unless it is one of the above-mentioned combo platters. This is garbage. Soup/salad is par for the course for most places now, and no amount of icky tempura-fried banana and slim pieces of fruit served as \"dessert\" can account for that. The salad dressing for the house salad tastes like water, and they use it like soup; my lettuce was SWIMMING. 

Pros: cold sushi, well-flavored rolls and nigiri, and a lot of options
Cons: # of waiters available, soup/salad for extra charge, super tiny portions, and very overpriced. 

I won't be back. There isn't much in the way of sushi in Chambana, but there is better than this."}
{"text":"I rated this 5 stars for their great service and food.  The service at Yellowfin is really exceptional, and in my opinion, it's among the best in service in Champaign-Urbana.  As part of their exceptional service, Yellowfin offers complimentary tastings of one of their appetizers (last night, we tried a seafood tortilla and the time before we had pumpkin soup) and they also give a complimentary dessert (a small serving of asian bananas foster with orange slices).  We have consistently had excellent service and great food here and are looking forward to going back soon."}
{"text":"the worst service that I ever had; I do not think they are authentic Japanese food. What they provided is so different from the food that I ate in Tokyo. Further, the waiter forgot to bring me the sauce for Teariki."}
{"text":"Best sushi place in Champaign-Urbana. It's definitely hidden, but worth it. They sometimes give you free appetizers, and their fish is as fresh as it gets for central IL. 
They have other foods that are a minor part of the menu."}
{"text":"This place is ok, but I would rather go to Kame. The service for the most part is really great, except the last time I was there they totally forgot our sushi rolls. My fiance and I order udon since we were not feeling well. We finished our meals and our sushi had yet to arrive. Twenty minutes later we got it. Usually I do not mind waiting for food, but when we got the rolls the were mediocre at best. In terms of the udon the broth was meh. IDK if I will give it another try."}
{"text":"This restaurant is WAY OVERPRICED!!!  The very small seating area is tacky - old - and dirty.  The food is so-so at best and the prices are double what they should be.  Much better choices are available in Champaign - try them first."}
{"text":"Quality of sushi here has gone down. Use to be decent here but now I'm afraid the sushi is quite lacking. The Korean pancake was very doughy and couldn't taste anything but the rubbery batter.

They put a little bit of wasabi the between the rice and fish when you order nigiri. So If you aren't a fan of wasabi make sure to specify that you don't want wasabi"}
{"text":"Super nice people make for an unexpectedly good dining experience. I had sashimi which was excellent, and seafood ramen (likewise), but what I really appreciated about Yellowfin was the outstanding service and very nice staff. The restaurant is clean and unpretentious. If you're seeking trendy and pretentious, this isn't the place. If you want very good sushi and fantastic service, I highly recommend Yellowfin. Pricing is middle of the road... Not cheap, not costly. The value is great."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. The outside may not be the best for evening business outings, but it is a great place for lunch. The box combos are decently priced for lunch, but I enjoy their sushi more. I do wish the edamame was warm as I received it cold, but everything was good. My friend got the spider roll, looked awesome! 

This place is great for sushi and comes without the side of attitude you get at Kofusion!"}
{"text":"We have been here a few times. Every time the service has been outstanding!!
Every roll I have ordered here has been extremely fresh and veryyyyy tasty!! If you haven't been here GO!"}
{"text":"Yellowfin offers good, quality sushi for the Champaign area. The ambiance is nice and they have some cute Asian decor. The prices are alright for sushi, but other menu items tend to be overpriced or underwhelming. I love, love, love the Philadelphia spring roll and Dragon sushi. Excellent presentation! They seem to occasionally bring out freebies to your table, my favorite of which is the tempura banana roll. The only thing that keeps me from giving them a 5 is the service. To be fair, I've only ever gone to Yellowfin as part of a larger party - 8-12 people. Every time, though, something has been.. off. First, out of four trips, we've been told twice that there weren't enough menus for everyone in our party, even though the restaurant wasn't even at half-capacity. The only times we've all gotten a menu is when there are only a couple other diners. Second, it takes a long time for a server to take orders, and even longer to actually get drinks to the table. I understand the food takes a while, and it's worth the wait. The sushi chef is very skilled at what he does. But there's no reason 8 people can't get soft drinks, tea and water within ten minutes of ordering when there are only 15 people total in the restaurant and at least two servers are working. Plus, I've never had refills on any drinks except water, when the menu does mention free refills on iced teas and sodas. I'll keep going back because the sushi is fantastic, but probably only on date nights or with a small group of friends."}
{"text":"The idea of eating sushi in the middle of Illinois is a little scary to me... I mean, how close is the closest ocean exactly?...

But after reading good things about Yellowfin, I thought I'd give it a try and see for myself. The restaurant is a little out of the way, but apparently it doesn't keep the \"crowds\" from coming: I went on a Monday night with terrible weather, and the restaurant was still relatively busy. 

Not too much to say about the place itself: the deco could definitely use more work, and it kind of looks like a cheap Chinese restaurant (with the exception of the sushi bar). But who really cares... 

The menu is pretty extensive, with mostly Japanese food (and a lot of sushi) but also some Korean items. I ordered the salmon teriyaki combo ($15), which turned out to be a lot more food than I expected: salmon filet and sauteed vegetable in teriyaki sauce, white rice, three pieces of sushi (tuna, salmon, shrimp), salad, a California roll, miso soup, and a scoop of ice-cream!! Needless to say I was full after finishing all that food. And while it wasn't necessarily exceptional, it was pretty good overall and I left satisfied. Not bad for the price."}
{"text":"Great sushi place. Definitely the epitome of a hidden gem, as the outside is deceiving. The menu is extensive, and the prices are affordable. The sushi rolls were all very good, with an artful presentation. 

We received complimentary edimame at the beginning, a free small \"appetizer\" bowl of a few pieces of raw tuna with our order of rolls, and a complimentary dessert of green tea ice cream with a rice cake coating (just the right portion size for two people, and a nice surprise end to the meal). Chefs/the waitress were friendly as we were leaving as well. Very satisfied with the experience."}
{"text":"This was the worst \"Japanese\" food my husband and I have ever had. We ordered 5 maki rolls. The pieces were so small they could not be considered pieces of maki. Two of the rolls supposedly had fish, but most of the pieces of maki had no recognizable fish inside. The rolls were so poorly made that they fell apart when we picked them up with the chopsticks. The taste was terrible. The wasabi wasn't real. It had the consistency of diarrhea and was dyed green. We felt sad after the meal, and cheated out of $45. First and last time ever eating here."}
{"text":"This place is not good, it is definitely not Japanese food. I asked them for teryiaki and got some Seshwan crap. The salad was tiny, the miso was salty and the sushi was cut horribly and was obviously not fresh. I also ordered four pieces of fish, confirmed my order because i didn't want to much food, and they gave me four orders of fish which is 8 pieces not four, unless you've never had real sushi you would know this place is poor. I will never eat there again."}
{"text":"First time visitor to this location and I have some likes and dislikes about the restaurant. 

The likes:

Great service. Everyone was very nice.  I never wanted for anything. I was seated quickly, my drink stayed full, and my food arrived quickly. Excellent. The food was good*, arrived hot* and there was definitely enough of it. I left full and then some. They throw in little extras like a slice of a vegetable egg cake appetizer and a small piece of fried banana with chocolate sauce and nuts for a dessert at no charge. Nice to see those unexpected extras on top of already good service. 

The dislikes:  

* The food was good, but I couldn't help but notice a lingering smell of chlorination that appeared in the soup, tea and some of the veg. I don't know if it's the remains of a bleach-based cleaning product or the unfortunate result of the local water supply. Not overpowering by any means, but noticeable. I also found the miso soup to be a little bland/watered down. 

* Hot except for my soup and the veg cake. Tepid/warm. Should've been hot. 

Price. I found menu items that I get at my local Japanese restaurants here that were easily $2-$4 more expensive. However, there is a lot of competition where I live that keeps the prices down. Just my experience. 

All that said, I'd come here again. The positives are worth it and if I come back I'll see if the tepid temperatures and under-flavored miso were a fluke or a genuine issue."}
{"text":"If you like sushi and your dining partner does not, this is an awesome place that has great options for both!  Lunch prices are super reasonable!!"}
{"text":"Five stars without a doubt! We have eaten at a few sushi places here in champaign, and this is definitely the best.  We started out with miso soup and the house salad.  The soup was perfect, especially on a cold night.  The salad dressing was delectable.  For our main course we ordered the salmon dragon roll, spider roll and tuna nigiri.  The salmon dragon roll was beyond words, and the spider roll was great as well.  The fish was so fresh, and everything looked beautiful.  The rolls stuck together very well.  We will definitely be back to yellowfin soon!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in chambana. You wouldn't know it from the outside but it is amazing. My boyfriend and I go here a few times a month and have never been disappointed and that's saying something. We haven't found a consistent place in the city yet except for yellowfin."}
{"text":"I am not a big sushi guy but I can say their California Roll is my favorite.  The ratio of rice to filling material tastes right, and the tastes seasoned.  I dont like a lot of rice in my rolls.  I also really like their Miso Ramen.  A good combo would be tempura appetizer, california roll, and Miso Ramen.  Again I dont like raw bland cold fish in any form."}
{"text":"Never before have I been so moved with intense fury to write my very first yelp review than when I decided to come here to eat. So its bad you ask? In short, not really. So why the 2 star rating? Please, allow me to explain. The service? Friendly and moderately paced. The ambiance? Very good and well decorated. The food? I enjoyed it. But, when you have the reckless audacity to charge $19.95 for a teriyaki salmon combination box, I expect my socks to be knocked off with either the amount of food or the taste (I also expect the food to come in a bento box). Spoiler alert! My socks remained snugly on my feet (and there was no box). First, the miso soup and salad came. The salad, as some have said, was good. The miso soup however was too watery and the tofu was disappointing. Then the main dish. The teriyaki sauce was good, the salmon was cooked perfectly, the stir fry vegetables were too raw, the fried rice was also good. This meal for its portion size and taste would have been absolutely perfect if it was priced at $10.95. It was not, hence, this rather upset review. I will admit that this rating may go up if I ever come back to try the sushi, which seems to be why the rating for this place is so high in the first place - \"if\" being the key operative word. Most other dishes, I felt were similarly outrageously priced, the chicken combo box for example was a whopping $17.95 - For Chicken!?!?! Salmon, I can understand up-charging, but Chicken!?!?  I cannot, in good faith, recommend this place for dinner. The lunch menu seemed more fairly priced. But if you with your $19.95 + tax, for whatever reason, ever find yourself at the Yellowfin Japanese Restaurant for dinner, please, for the love of all that is good, DO NOT squander that hard-earned money on a salmon combination box because, among other things, you may not even get a box."}
{"text":"I went to yellowfin restaurant for the first time today. I thought of giving yellowfin a shot as I keep on passing it while I drive so I wanted to try food there for a long time and today we managed to go and have some good and relaxing time there. We went in and the server was very cheerful. She quickly sat us to our table. There was two more table in the entire restaurant but the server some how seem to be very busy. There was only one server maybe because it's a slow Tuesday lunch, but both the tables had their food already served but still the server was just running here and there. I don't know why ?? After 10 minutes she came to our table and asked for drinks. We ordered a large Kirin beer and we ordered 2 gyoza ,2 orders of yakidori, and spicy tuna tempura (appetizer). Our gyoza came in which was just ok nothing very special. We were excited about our yakidori but when it came out it was very disappointing too.  We waited for our last  appetizer spicy tuna tempura for almost half an hour. But when it came out it was distasteful, no presentation at all, there was almost no spicy tuna and was filled up with just cream cheese in jalapeño base. I was very upset more than that we ordered a spicy chicken bento which we didn't even eat anything except for edamame that comes in it and the Illini roll and Champaign roll  and two spicy tuna hand roll which was as disgusting, it was very distasteful and presentation was zero. We just ordered another round of beer and none of us ate anything except drinking beer. We just munched a bite and we were done with that horrible food. I am very much Surprised that the business is still running. Their sushi and food sucks and so is the sauce they put one every sushi rolls. They are all very sweet and unpleasant. We spent almost 120 $$ for lunch there and left vey disappointing never to go back ever again. Worst food , worst sushi . Worst presentation for expensive price. Save money and eat somewhere else. Don't even think of giving this restaurant a shot. If u do just order one item at a time and try it first you will know if you want to order more or not. Don't order everything together and be disappointed like us."}
{"text":"If I were rating Yellowfin in comparison to all the other Japanese restaurants in ONLY Champaign-Urbana, I would give it 3.  

Here's why Yellowfin gets 2 stars:
-The size of the nigirizushi was small, particularly the rice.  The cut of the fish was fine, but the rice underneath was way too small.
-The rice was sloppily formed.  The rolls had rice poking out from both ends past the seaweed and the nigirizushi rice was not properly formed.  Now, this isn't to say that the rolls didn't taste good, because they did; however, presentation is very important when is comes to Japanese cuisine.
-The nigirizushi was placed on top of a bamboo leaf.  Now this looked nice, but bamboo leaves have a very distinct taste and it definitely added a strange flavor to the nigirizushi rice.
-The sushi platters did not come with miso soup or a salad.  This should be included in the meal because Japanese meals don't just consist of one large plate.  There are always small elements to be included, like a salad or soup.  These you had to pay extra for for a ridiculous price for its size.  This I disliked more than anything.

Anyways, I hope this review helps."}
{"text":"Love this unassuming little restaurant. It's a well-kept secret that this place has some of the best sushi in town along with other authentic Asian cuisine. Small, low-key, simply decorated interior. Good service too."}
{"text":"For years I was fooled by this restaurant's nondescript yellow exterior. The inside is clean and well maintained with small touches of oriental decor---nothing exquisite, though certainly adequate.

Tonight I had the Philadelphia rolls and vegetable yakisoba. (I was a little disappointed this order doesn't include miso soup.) The yakisoba seemed a little heavy on grease and sauce but tasted fine. Although prices appeared reasonable, portions were tiny and barely satiating.

Service is good. Our waitress tonight was friendly and attentive, and based on my past experiences here, this tends to be the norm.

There's really nothing wrong with Yellowfin---it's very much a hidden gem and one of Champaign's top spots for Japanese cuisine. That said, nothing about this restaurant strikes me as exceptional, so I'm going to go with a solid four out of five stars."}
{"text":"So unimpressed.

I came here with two friends.  One had been hesitant to eat here as last time he had found a bone in his sushi, but we figured 'hey, it happens!' and gave yellowfin a chance.  Worst.  Decision. Ever.  

Between the three of us we found 4+ bones in our sushi.   The sushi was painfully average and the ratio of wasabi to rice in the nigiri was either too weak or too strong.  Speaking of wasabi, theirs had this weird gritty consistency to it - kind of like when you make a paste with flour.  And it was really, really weak.  Ick. I'm not even sure the agedashi tofu we ordered contained tofu - it was this weird mess of over fried... something?  batter? panko? And resembled little crumpled piece of paper.  Yeah no.  Not good.

We were seated at the bar which also doubled as the area where food was served from.  It was interesting to see the number of orders that had to be brought back or changed because the chef had forgotten something.  It was extra interesting to watch the plates get passed over my friend's head while we are trying to have dinner. 

Our server ensured we had plenty of time to talk by being completely inattentive.  It took him easily 15-20 minutes just to take our order and then we waited... and waited... and waited for the food to come out.  Thankfully my friends are good company or the wait would have been excruciatingly painful.  The one time he did check up on us we mentioned all the bones we had found and his response was to nod, do a little laugh, shrug and walk off.  Right.  I must have missed that becoming an appropriate reaction.  My bad.

All in all a bad experience.  Never again."}
{"text":"Yellowfin was a lot nicer than I expected. The outside is a strip mall on the edge of campus, but when you enter the door it's actually pretty nice and well-decorated. 

I'm not a Sushi aficionado (yet), but what I tried was delicious. I got a Bento box, which was much cheaper than Kofusion's, but also had less food. Mine contained terayaki salmon, tasty vegetables, a rather bland iceberg salad, rice, and a delicious cucumber-sesame salad. There was an option to add on California rolls for $2.00. The menu is extensive, so you can bring your sushi-adverse friends and order soba or Korean BBQ. 

Service was attentive and in the end, the bill was surprisingly low. Too bad it's so out of the way. I think with their long menu I could go here over and over again."}
{"text":"Wasn't sure what to expect with a sushi bar in a college town. We were pleasantly surprised. Good service, appetizing sushi, and open during a holiday. Worth a re-visit should we be back in the area"}
{"text":"We used to LOVE this place. We haven't been there in a minute, but tonight, we were excited to go back to one of our favorite haunts....No Bueno!!

First of all, they have tried to make sushi a grunge place. All the wait staff were wearing tired jeans and t-shirts that have been worn 200 times. 

The sushi chefs looked like they rode their skate boards to work...dirty shirts, and ball caps on backward.

We were never checked on, and they dropped off the bill like it was dynamite...they knew if they asked how things were, they might not get a good response. 

The fish was AT LEAST a week old, and I am still tasting the aftertaste....it sucked. I have been doing sushi at least once a week for 3 decades...this was THE WORST sashimi I have ever tasted. 

This place sucks balls!!! I would NEVER go here again!!!"}
{"text":"I'd only give a place 5 stars if it really really deserved it, and honestly, Yellowfin is the best sushi and Japanese I've ever had.  I've eaten at Japanese places all over C-U (including KOFusion - way overrated and overpriced), and Yellowfin is the perfect hole in the wall restaurant.  When you finally walk into the place, it's wonderfully decorated with clean lines and the awesome sushi bar complete with an old Japanese chef behind it making all the sushi.  Once my boyfriend and I discovered the place, we've gone back several times already.  It's delicious!  Mmm and the hot sake!"}
{"text":"The sushi rice was a bit dry, but the fish on the nigiri special was good. The chirashi sushi rice interestingly was not dry for some reason. I must have gotten to rice at the bottom of the cooker.

Next door is a well stocked korean super market. Neat place to go to pick up something to cold to drink on the road home."}
{"text":"We had to wait for a long time to get our food. But they gave us a free appetizer and dessert so that was nice of them. The only reason I have removed two stars is because of the main chef who seemed to be having a hard time back there, and was constantly pushing the poor server around. If I could review our server seperately, I would give him 6 on 5. He was extremely sweet and trying his best to keep the ship afloat at a busy yet severely understaffed place. Our meal became unpleasant due to the constant yelling by the chef directed towards the server. It does not make for a good Friday night. If they want more customers to keep coming back, they need to make sure the atmosphere is good! The soba noodles and pancake were great, while the sushi left much to be desired."}
{"text":"I made my first trip here recently and ordered two types of small sushi rolls. Both were exactly what I'd expect and tasted great. The miso soup is good, but the salad is where it's at. Their ginger dressing is the best I've had from any similar restaurants. Now I can't come here without getting a salad. The service was very quick and friendly also. Pricing was comparable to other sushi spots."}
{"text":"Considering that the place was almost completely empty when we went (on a Tuesday night at 7:30 in a bit of a snowstorm), I'm not sure if the excellent service and free starters and dessert we received were a regular feature of the restaurant or merely a lucky by-product of the bad weather.  Either way, we got a ridiculous amount of food for $30 (Shumai and the Sushi B combo, plus all the free food and a small bottle of very good hot sake), and it was all wonderful.  I'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"On my second trip to Champaign in recent weeks, I decided to stop by the other highly reviewed sushi spot in town.   Yellowfin is on the edge of the University of Illinois campus (athletic side) and they serve solid rolls for being in the middle of Illinois.  Among the selections, the deep fried lobster roll was probably my favorite and you really need to try the seafood pancakes (which is technically more Korean than Japanese - but if they are well prepared - who cares?).   The rest of the rolls were pretty routine, but I agree with other reviewers that Sushi Kame is still the go to place when you're visiting this small, but well fed college town."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon, the place was empty. The decor was modern and the host/server was very polite. I ordered a lunch box off the lunch special menu which cost me about 11 dollars. The salad was phenomenal! The dressing was sweet and is everything you would expect from a Japanese house salad. The California rolls were rolled well and tasted amazing. The food will surely contribute to my decision to come back. 

What I did not like: water came out without any ice in it. The server stood in the open and essentially watched us as we ate. I understand this was probably due to the fact that the place was dead for the time, however it's completely unnerving to have someone hover near you while you are trying to enjoy your lunch.

Delightful, small, and unbecoming little Japanese place, will be back again."}
{"text":"Very nice sushi, with a long list of complicated rolls, but pricey.  Fish was fresh and cut well.  I enjoyed everything I tried - raw and cooked.

Don't let the exterior fool you.  Heck, don't let the interior fool you!"}
{"text":"It's close by so I occasionally had lunch there. Food is OK; not many people. The waitress is very nice, but seems like she's the only waitress so sometimes service can be a little slow if you happen to be there during busy time."}
{"text":"Yummy! This and Kofusion are probably my two favorite places for sushi/Japanese food in the Champaign-Urbana area. At lunchtime, they have great sushi meals that come with salad, cucumbers, potstickers or some other assorted item, as well as the awesome rolls that are served up. The price is pretty good considering the amount of food (I usually have a take-home box). For dinner, my husband and I either go for our respective entree preferences (mine being ramen, his being... well, it varies) plus a roll, or we get a few different rolls to split. The sushi chef always gives us an appetizer on the house (can vary from cucumbers with a light soy sauce, to squid) and sometimes there is dessert like fruit, mochi, fried banana, etc.

Sometimes when things get busy, service can take a really long time. However, the quality of the food more than makes up for any negative experiences I've had. This is a must-eat place in Champaign-Urbana!"}
{"text":"The server is the best and the food is good. It is tucked away in a strange place but the inside is pleasant and the server is awesome. The food is fresh and you get special appetizers. It is not very crowded so you can come whenever you want."}
{"text":"I really wish I had tried Yellowfin before my last week in Champaign. It looks a pretty sketch from the outside, but on the inside it's really nice looking, though small.  We ordered 3 rolls to share between the 2 of us, and it was a little too much food-- but, we were also sent multiple items from the chef, white and red tuna, and then a tempura fried banana for dessert.

Some of the rolls were a little bit loose, but it didn't bother me.  The fish was absolutely delicious.  They have rolls for both new sushi eaters (my companion) and more adventurous ones (myself).  Overall I think it's a great little place and will be going back when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Oh Yelp reviewers, you have let me down. My meal at Yellowfin left a lot to be desired.

I was eager to try some real Ramen. After reading some good reviews on Yelp, ordered the Pork ramen. I was starry eyed and dreaming about delicious, shoyu ramen with slices of pork belly. And... when the dish finally arrived what did I see? A spicy broth? That's... somewhat strange for ramen. But I'll eat it. What about the noodles? Clearly instant.... Two lonely pieces of shrimp and some hard, overcooked chunks of pork that had no flavor whatsoever. The broth tasted exactly like that of Shin ramyun. For a $11 price tag, I expect more than some instant ramen. I can get that at home.

We did also try some of the sushi which was definitely better than some other options near campus. But overall, with the high prices, and the food only being marginally better... we won't be back."}
{"text":"Overpriced and nothing special.
They try hard, but the neighborhood is so ugly and the place is so quiet, when went for lunch it was awkward."}
{"text":"If you like sushi you should eat here. The place is the best price I have ever seen and the sushi is so very good.  Cute little family owned place not much from the outside but very cute on the inside. The staff is always attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"From the outside, this place's looks are *not* impressive. Entering, though, you find that this is a good and popular spot for sushi, etc.

Visiting a couple weeks ago, my wife and I had a couple of fairly unusual and quite tasty maki: Amigo (redolent of cilantro) and Illini (with Italian herbed oil). We really enjoyed the spicy tuna dish appetizer, and tempura appetizer.

On the other hand, the green tea was not hot, barely warm. And, the combination of popularity, close tables, and hard surfaces made the place extremely noisy. Once the crowd died down and the restaurant was 1/3 full, conversation could again be carried on without shouting.

This was probably our third time, and won't be the last. But, we'll try to go during off-peak hours to avoid the noise."}
{"text":"As a recent transplant to the area from California, I am on a serious hunt for a great sushi place. Yellowfin was just about as satisfactory as Sushi Kame in my opinion, and neither of them really blew my mind.

Granted I got take out and by the time I arrived home the fish was practically room temperature (it was sitting on the counter when I arrived.) I understand the results of rice in the refrigerator, but  give a shorter pick-up time so that it is not prepared after 10 minutes and then sitting out for 15.

Many of the reviews for these places rave about the rolls, and for good reason. A sushi roll does some really great things for masking the quality of the fish you are using. Toss in some mayo, masago, and cucumber and it all tastes the same. My nigiri left sooo sooo much to be desired. The tuna was dark and stringy, the salmon almost flavorless, and the rest of the assortment was dry and average. Secondly, too...much...wasabi. Each piece had a huge amount underneath the fish...my sinuses may never be the same. After a few pieces I began disassembling everything to wipe off some of it in order to actually taste the fish.

The one roll that really made me smile was the spicy tuna. Rarely do sushi joints use the right amount of mayonnaise, and this one surprisingly does. It was creamy, but not overly so. 

I cannot speak for any of the cooked food but I am sure they are fine. My personal mission is finding good fish...and I understand the difficulties of that in central Illinois, but I haven't given up yet!"}
{"text":"Best place in town for Japanese food. Great food, great staff and prices are a littler cheaper than other restaurants where you pay for the ambiance.

beef teriaki combo during lunch hours is delicious and portion is large. 

Many types of rolls I've tried are excellent."}
{"text":"My friend and I enjoyed dinner here this week.  The service was great.  The free apps. were tasty.  My friend really enjoyed the sushi that he ordered.  I went with the teriyaki shrimp.  It was a very generous portion and tasty.  I asked for it spicy and they delivered, though maybe a bit too much.  But I got what I asked for so I'm not complaining."}
{"text":"Don't let the outside fool you, Yellowfin is a hidden gem.  I was skeptical at first since KoFusion and others are solid sushi choices in the area.  However, I'm always out for the best.  Inside, Yellowfin is actually a quaint little place.  It's a LOT smaller than the other sushi joints.  There are about eight tables and a sushi bar.  

Don't be fooled by the size though, the sushi is great.  Everything was fresh and they even use real crab.  The sushi selection is expansive and very reasonably priced.  They also serve sushi in to-go ramekins rather than pouches.  Just a little like of mine :)  Those pouches are never enough!  

The only problem I had with Yellowfin is that the sushi was not rolled very well.  The pieces were loose and falling apart when I ate them.  So good it doesn't matter though :)"}
{"text":"First of all, I'm a daughter of a Sushi Chef so I know what I'm talking about when it comes to Sushi.

I had a Chirashizushi at Yellow Fin, it's a assortment box of sashimi topped on rice. 

1. Over Priced - I had same stuff atleast 4 dollars cheaper

2. Weird Stuff inside - pickled carrots / furikake stuff traditionally NOT found in Chirashizushi were present

and most important

3. Old sashimi - I smelled a piece of the sashimi, smelled like fish! (i mean, the unpleasent smell of fish going bad) probably raw fish that stayed in the fridge for 3 days.

I only went to yellowfin once and I choose Chirashizushi cause I can try different types of sashimi they sereve. Probably never going back there unless I'm hanging out with 10 friends who're craving for yellow fin."}
{"text":"For sushi in the middle of Illinois this is pretty decent."}
{"text":"I went here to fulfill my ridiculous sushi craving.  I ordered a rainbow and spider roll and it was delicious.  I'm not a sushi expert and it doesn't take much to satisfy me, but I was definitely satisfied.  The service was excellent and everyone was very friendly.  As far as pricing goes, it's not cheap, but it's what I'd expect for sushi."}
{"text":"The first time going here was on a busy weekend night, where the entire place was only staffed by one person. It took a while of standing at the front to even get noticed, then forever to get our food. I can only assume that there was a staffing crisis, because the next time I went, there were 2 waiters, and it was on a much less busy weekday night.

We were immediately noticed and seated, and our order was taken promptly and cheerfully. Our appetizers came out really quick, then our food immediately afterwards. This was really fast, because let me tell you, when we order sushi, we order a TON. Like, surely-they're-making-fun-of-the-fat-Americans-back-in-the-kitchen amounts.  My only complaint for this visit was the noise level.  It seemed as though there was some kind of a reunion going on at the table next to ours, which had at least 10 people at it.  They were all getting pretty sauced and obnoxious.  This really wasn't the fault of the restaurant, but it's so small that they were drowning out our conversation, if not all of the conversations in the restaurant.

All of the sushi was right on. It was expensive, but isn't it always?"}
{"text":"Very nice inside. Service great, and sushi very fresh. Had the Chef's Special Roll. Great!"}
{"text":"Good flavor but I can't stand loose rolls that fall apart...  A bit more work on tightening up would make a big difference...  Will give them another whirl  - worth a shot."}
{"text":"So, my friend and I came in here on a Saturday and we were greeted with an empty place. That was fine but upon examining the menu I realized the prices were pretty steep for an average looking place; fine, I decided to order the calamari Bento box. This is where everything went wrong. One, they gave me a plate and I had to choose between rice and a California roll, just couldn't have both. So, the \"box\" ended up being a half empty plate with, mostly vegetables. But, two, the calamari tasted exactly like ammonia, I couldn't and wouldn't eat it. It was decomposing when it got to me and that is 17$+ worth of disgusting. When I told my waitress she gave me a 10%, $1.70, discount. Great. They even addmited to the calamari not being fresh, after trying it. I don't think I would come back, there are too many other, actually great, sushi restaurants in CU."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town. Great service and tasty little dishes sent out by the chef before the meal."}
{"text":"Once again we had an outstading fesh yummy dinner. We had 4 in are party and instead of ordering individual rolls we went and ordered a small platter. Far more cost effective and the sushi and sashimi rolls arrived in a huge boat, yes a huge wooden boat... awesome!"}
{"text":"If you want higher quality sushi in the Urbana-Champaign area, skip Sushi Rock or that joke of an \"upscale\" restaurant, Kofusion.

Yellowfin is a solid choice when you are looking at rolls or sashimi.

PROS:
+ Sashimi options are above average in selection; they have fatty tuna, market price of about $10-11 for 2 pieces
+ Rolls are creative and taste great
+ They can READ MINDS!! That or somehow they figured out that it was my girlfriend's birthday dinner and delivered her rolls on a bamboo stand with candles stuck in wasabi balls haha

CONS:
- Entrees such as the teppanyaki all fail miserably short in flavor, quality, and consistency
- If there are more than 3 tables filled, the restaurant gets overwhelmed and you can expect a dramatic fall off in service and increase in wait times for your food
- Miso soup is bland

I agree with the other reviewer that lamented the fact that the rice was a little sloppy on the rolls and nigiri. I agree that sushi is an art, but when you're in southeastern Illinois in the middle of the cornfields with Korean sushi chefs, sometimes you just have to lower your expectations on good lookin' sushi. If fresh fish and rolls are what you're looking for, look no further than Yellowfin.

The restaurant is run by Koreans, and they seem to be understaffed in the front as well as the back. However, service is attentive when it's not too busy, and the servers are college-age and friendly.

There is a Korean market right next door and I would highly recommend stopping by to pick up some groceries or just great Asian junk food like Shin Ramen or those delectable Asian funyuns.

Come here on a date or with a small group of friends for the good quality and selection of sashimi and rolls; the ambiance at night is intimate when it's not full. They have large bottles of all 3 major Japanese beers (Asahi, Sapporo, Kirin) for your enjoyment as well."}
{"text":"This is a 3.5 star review.  I waffled on whether I should give them three stars or four, but I really think that they could improve on a few things, and settled on three stars.

The Good
- The space is small, but not tightly-packed
- Our waitress was sweet and friendly
- The chef sent us a free dish - tempura-fried seaweed-wrapped whitefish garnished with octopus (squid?) tentacles.  It was very good, and a nice gesture.
- The maki we ordered (Spider, Silk Road, and Crazy rolls) were very tasty

The Not-as-Good
- The space is small, so every time the door opened, freezing cold air blasted in
- The waitress was understandably busy, as she was the only one working the whole restaurant, but this meant that she couldn't give much attention to any one table
- The appetizer we ordered, shumai, was so close to being really tasty - it was five pork-filled dumplings with a wasabi sauce.  Now, I love wasabi, but it overwhelmed the sauce and made it difficult to taste the dumpling itself.
- The maki was kind of...I don't know...sloppily-rolled?  Two of the three rolls we ordered were pretty big and tended to fall apart.

Champaign isn't exactly a booming sushi metropolis, so I'll be back...hopefully they can bump my experience up a star!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi in Chambana.  I will not bother to repeat what the other posters have stated, but in my 3 visits I have found the rolls to be expertly rolled, the fish to be fresh, and the prices to be reasonable. The decor is no Ko-Fusion, but it is elegant and I think that if you compared their prices side-by-side, this would come out on top my more than a few cents.

1 in 3 times service was questionable, as it seemed like our order got ignored in favor of a big party, but I forgave them when I got their \"I'm Sorry\" salad and my fat rolls."}
{"text":"The food was magnificent. They brought 3 free treats; soup, slices of potato pancakes & fried banana desert. They were super friendly & nice."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good Japanese restaurant, this place and Sakanaya would be the place to go. It's best to come here during lunch simply due to the lunch specials they have. The waitress here is really sweet and I really wonder if she's the only person that works here as a waitress. Expect your meal to cost around $12."}
{"text":"Used to be good, but upon recent visiting their food quality is dropping.  Their miso soup is really bad somehow, tastes like plain water. The price is somewhat above average price."}
{"text":"I'm eating the Chicago Roll and the Silk Rd roll right now. Both are well done and tasty, but nothing new or exciting. I came with pretty high hopes for this place, especially since reviews are so good for them. The sushi is good, but not worth the ridiculous price tag it comes with. Each roll (eight small/medium pieces) was $11.50. Sushi is usually expensive, but come on, this is champaign urbana and even in high-priced Naperville you don't see these disgustingly high prices. 3 stars because they really need to lower their prices. Even miso soup is $2.50, which should tip you off right there that this place is overpriced. Save your money and eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Service is good. You get free samples and the waitress is very nice.
However don't expect good sushi here. The rice will be in terrible shapes and fish is not fresh. The rolls are hardly rolled together. Chopsticks can easily destroy all the shapes. Also overpriced. 
Honestly I can make a better sushi on my own."}
{"text":"The sushi was good but I was expecting a better experience from what i had heard. Decor/ambience not up to the price level."}
{"text":"In my quest to find the best sushi spot in Chambana, I decided to follow the high reviews Yellowfin has here. Perhaps my expectations going in were consequently too high, but I was a bit underwhelmed. I'll chock it up to bad luck, and probably head back to try again soon.

We got there before the Saturday night rush and got a lot more attention from the wait staff than I assume you'd get at prime time. The waitress was very sweet and patient as we picked through their menu. 

We ordered the sushi appetizer which was a basic assortment of nigiri sushi, cucumber maki, and ahi maki. My dinner partner is not a fan of spice and we immediately noticed that the chef was spreading wasabi on every piece. I didn't mind it as much, but it really had a bad effect on them.

We soldiered on and ordered a diverse combination of rolls. We tried a Philly roll, scallop nigiri, an avocado and eel roll, a Spider, and a few basic fish rolls. Overall it was passable sushi, but nothing to write home about. The amount of wasabi that permeated the night ended up overpowering a lot of the base flavors I crave. Also, I'm guessing we were getting the leftover stock from lunchtime. By the time we paid the place was filling up so maybe next time a wait will yield better food.

Ultimately, it is worth a shot. I'm willing to head back, but I hope our experience was an anomaly."}
{"text":"This place looked promising.

The sushi was all right but not great.

I also tried the banana tempura and the asparagus appetizer which was pretty good. 

Overall it was an okay sushi place, but not quite as good as the other reviews make it out to be."}
{"text":"I have dined here many times over the years and I have always had a great experience. The best sushi in town, small and intimate dining area. I find the location wonderful. It is in a little out of the way strip mall, sort of behind an IGA. This really adds to the experience of finding a hidden gem.

Great food, great experience. Just go and order whatever you want, you will be glad you went."}
{"text":"Restaurant review
My quest to find a solid Japanese restaurant unfortunately began here. I do not like to give one star reviews but when the food and price don't match up that is a big let down. I saw a bunch of the positive reviews and negative reviews and decided to give this place a try. The service was nice and friendly which is a huge plus, but the rest was a big let down. Why may you ask...
1. My wife got a dragon roll. It was the saddest dragon roll ever. Thinly sliced fish that had a very off color, not vibrant like you would expect and the roll itself was almost falling apart. Check the photos for yourself
2. I got the chicken teriyaki with rice. Someone needs to check what the difference is with teriyaki and soy sauce. It felt like chinese stir fried chicken bits. Most japanese restaurants will not dice up the chicken into little cubes and then stir fry it in soy sauce. There was no sweet taste you would expect with real teriyaki sauce and this cost 17.95.... I feel very ripped off!

Pro: free small appetizer was given (tempura battered banana and a fish cake of some sort), friendly service

Cons: EXPENSIVE, food is borderline average to below

Hidden gem:
None"}
{"text":"Love this place!  I have only ever ordered rolls from the a la carte and they are always great.  My favorite is the Champaign roll, a bit pricey but definitely worth it."}
