{"text":"Friendly & fast service; good food (especially for lunch prices). We have tried Tom yum soup which was yummy, garlic chicken and crispy beef as well. Shrimp dumplings were not so good, but hey, still a good place for lunch."}
{"text":"An awful restaurant. Lazy and unwelcoming staff. We waited 45 minutes for our starter. Another 30 minutes for the meal. The food was terrible. Do NOT even try."}
{"text":"Very average food. The prices for the lunch specials are excellent, but the food is Americanized Chinese and not a very good version of it. The 6 people in my party were underwhelmed after eating here."}
{"text":"Went during transition from 5 Asian Cuisine to Hakka No. 1:   We had one bad experience out of 3.  Server did not ask if my wife was finished with her food and automatically threw dirty napkins in her sauce based dish.  No apology, just an \"OKaaaay\" response.  Really really put us off and made the whole meal awkward for us.  He has served us before with decent service nothing to rave about.  The other servers are fantastic.  FOOD wise has always been excellent eating in, ingredients are fresh and food is not greasy.  Recommend Thousand Island Fish and Chili Chicken with Gravy.    We have ordered take out 4 times and the food has been consistently great with the exception of a friend noodle dish that was plain and tasteless.  Probably missed the salt or msg.    Just ordered today and delivery was fast and driver was very polite.    I'm still a fan but still angry about the service we received the one time we went."}
{"text":"Pretty good place for lunch. Went here with a workgroup and ordered spring rolls and hot and sour soup. My peers ordered chilli chicken and noodles and everyone was pleased with there dishes. Probably would go back when in the area."}
{"text":"If you haven't been to a hakkah restaurant before, then you are in for a treat. If you have, well now you don't need to travel to Scarborough to get it!  This place is great. The food is delicious, serving size is plentiful, and the price is great. I had Manchurian paneer last time, which wasn't exactly the greatest, but I've had it before then and it had always been delicious (so maybe just a one off thing). Hakkah styled noodles are a must and the soups are fantastic.  Try this place out. For the price, you really can't go wrong! :)"}
{"text":"Amazing food and prices! A group of us ordered the chili chicken, Shanghai chicken noodle, Bombay chicken, manchurian chicken fried rice and crispy beef. All were exceptionally tasty! My new favorite hakka place."}
{"text":"We just left the restaurant and already we are planning our next visit next week. If you're lucky enough to get the drunken lobster special, order 2; one for each of you. If you knew how delicious it was, you wouldn't share.  The coconut chicken and wonton chicken soup was tasty and we had numerous other appetizers; mango salad, shrimp rolls and chicken satay...wow.  Oh and don't forget to order the chicken & shrimp 3 brown rice, it's hard to come by...Take it from this foodie couple, who eats out a minimum of 5 dinners a week, if you're in the area eat HERE. Prices moderate, taste exceptional!!!"}
{"text":"Thought I check this place out with a few friends, and if it's a busy day you are going to be waiting a long time to be seated and served, if you have no patience don't go.  The place was busy but not overly packed, I waited 30-40 minutes from the time I was seated o the time I ate.   I fount the menu to be WAY too big, all sorts of different options, way too big.  Taste of the food is okay, nothing special, Thai dish shrimps were the size of my pinky which is a little ridiculous for a shrimp dish I expected larger shrimps.  The food seems to be fresh and quantities are large and if you will eat anything almost you will enjoy this.  Come with a big group of people and you will get your moneys worth.  Some other places are a bit better, but I found it just okay!"}
{"text":"We go to this restaurant often from couple to family of eight. Nice people, but lately the food is very inconsistent. Take out food gets even worst, sometimes with undercooked fried chicken. And to add insult, earlier tonight I ordered diner and with sweet and sour chicken, with sauce on the side. They wanted to charge me $1 extra, for sauce on the side, container cost. Don't know why they are getting ridiculous, but I don't really appreciate such businesses."}
{"text":"We bought takeout from here last night and overall it was a good experience.   Pickup was quick Food tastes good (I recommend the spicy crispy beef)  Mango sticky rice did not taste good Portions are generous  Price was good for a restaurant"}
{"text":"The worst in that Shopping  Plaza.Tables were  dirty and  sticky. The food was really  bad. Not recomended."}
{"text":"Very amazed at how great this restaurant is. Been living in the area forever and never even saw it. Just had the chicken gyoza, chicken satay with peanut sauce and crispy beef. All terrific."}
{"text":"Ive been there only once, but i died. It was very tasty, but like i said, im dead. They sure know how to fill you up. Chili chicken and general tao chicken were both good.   -hiyafive"}
{"text":"Very tasty and authentic hakka. The chili chicken is perfect. I've been here for both take out and dine in for lunch time. Dine in for lunch was great. The chili chicken came out tasting so fresh and slightly crunchy, I loved it. The veggie hakka noodles and general tso chicken are also very good."}
{"text":"This place is under new management  I had lunch with my wife there and the attraction was that they offered a wider menu than just a Chinese place  Want a spicy Thai soup, Kung Pao chicken and a Vietnamese roll as a starter...not a problem  Lunch specials are reasonably priced and the food came out hot from the wok  Polite service from staff even if there were only 3 people eating lunch at the time.  Decor is kind of upscale so this is good spot for a date or even a birthday"}
{"text":"Price was okay but the food was not good at all. They use way too much corn starch (in order to cheap out). Food was too slimy.   Inside wasn't too bad, looked clean enough.   Overall, wouldn't recommend this place"}
{"text":"I cannot believe the service I got from Tom (the owner/manager), read my first review.   Today I went in for lunch and they had lunch specials ranging from $5.95 to $6.95 ($1.50 more for steamed vegetables), I recommend getting the steamed vegetables though you may not be able to finish it.   Family ordered two chilli chickens and one bombay chicken, with veggies and spring roll. Received incredible service as before and great food. Crispy, Non-greasy, quality ingredients,  what more can you ask?!?!   We paid our bill with a generous tip, and left.   However when we were in our car, Tom ran out to catch is before we left. Turns out we paid $20.00 more on a $29 bill excluding tips (I hate those plastic bills).   Again incredible serivce, honest management, great food, what more can you ask! So if you are in a mood for hakka chinese, GO TO THIS PLACE!!!!   Read my first review if you are not convinced!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat, came here with my family and we ordered 5 dishes , 1 appetizer and 1 soup. The bill was like $80 for 6 person. It was very filling and we had a lot of leftover . My mom love the chicken Szechuan fried rice. The Cantonese chow mein was my fav."}
{"text":"Four stars for their extensive lunch deal menu -excellent value (ordered through just-eat.ca). They give you a large portion of food with rice at fairly good quality. Nice attention to detail and customer service.   Overall, I recommend the gyoza, chili chicken, and drunken garlic shrimp. Spring rolls and the huge pad thai was not bad - another great value menu item considering it came with nicely cooked chicken, shrimp and tofu. I wouldn't ordee the cashew chicken (not enough flavour) or the crispy chicken again (not a fan of the batter)."}
{"text":"Great quality food. Big portions and much better presentation than a lot of other hakka style restaurants. Place is very clean and we always get our food on time. Very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I have been to this place a number of times. Their food has always been very good, and service quick. They have a good variety of dishes, but their menu seems to change quite a bit (which isn't necessarily a good thing).   One thing that stays consistent is the hugeness of their dishes, and value. Today we got the Szechewan Hakka Noodles and the Sweet and Sour Chicken combo with fried rice and a spring roll. Along with a small soup, tax and tip, it was $27 and we had half of it to take home."}
{"text":"I ate lunch with my friend Bob. The place had nice decor and was well renovated. We came for lunch on a Friday and it was not very busy so we were seated quickly.   The restaurant has a pretty extensive lunch menu ranging from $5.95 to $6.95 and it came with a spring roll. We ordered the Cantonese lo mein and the chili chicken with steamed rice - both $5.95. The food came quickly and the portion size was okay. However, the Cantonese lo mein was unusually watery and the noodles were not crispy as expected. The ingredients did not appear fresh (I.e. Some of the vegetables were canned). The chili chicken tasted better but there were too many hot peppers, which made it too spicy.   Overall, the food was a little bit below average but the price was extremely affordable thus a 3 star rating was given."}
{"text":"I went in for lunch today and the experience was mediocre. I ordered the Hot and Sour vegetable soup. It was delicious and filled with tofu, vegetables and was the perfect amount of spice. For a small the size was perfectly portioned as well.  For my entr√©e I ordered the lunch special spicy vegetable balls with rice. It came with a vegetable spring roll. The spring roll was all doughy and hand barely any vegetables in it. The spicy vegetable balls were a good portion size with a great amount of spice. Unfortunately the balls were mainly rice, with a little bit of carrots. I couldn't point out any other veggies in the rolls.   The service was friendly and quick. I will be back because the hot and sour soup is delicious and vegetarian. There are a lot of other vegetarian options on the menu I will try, so hopefully my rating will increase.   Cheers."}
{"text":"Have been multiple times. Like their Hakka food. Recommend Manchurian noodles, Bombay chicken and Veggie garlic balls!"}
{"text":"Just sat in the restaurant with a date. As we where concluding and chatting, I noticed one of the servers getting up , turning around and immediately started deeply scratching his genital area. WTF! We walked out but shortly walked in and demanded to speak with the owners. We confronted the waiter and he admitted to his indecent act in the restaurant. The Manger came out but would not give us the owners # .... This is a first for me. Yuck!! Don't eat here!! God knows what happens in the back...I want puke right now!!!"}
