{"text":"Avoid if you are hungry or thirsty.  My husband and I sat at a table and a waitress came over and got us a round pretty quickly but then never came back for our food order.  We moved to the bar to hopefully get waited on but they ignored us there too.  We left to eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Friendly bartenders and prompt service are enough to earn 3 stars for me. Cheap drinks and an open environment give it 4 for me. As of reopening the bar has tvs and a more open feel behind it. Other than that? Same place it was over a year ago. Limited but simple menu. They have burgers and fries! It's bar food people! Go down the road for a giant menu if you'd like but if your game plan is good drinks and friendly service in a clean yet divey environment I would head here."}
{"text":"I recently discovered their dry rub wings and have been going back weekly getting them to go! Try them, you won't regret it! Awesome!!!!!"}
{"text":"Dive bar!    My dad apparently likes to go to Dover Gardens from time to time.  The Gardens are the epitome of a dive bar.   - Wooden exterior: CHECK - An interior that doesn't have too much light: CHECK - Cheap beer on tap (in this case, Labatt's Blue): CHECK - Keno!: CHECK - Losing at Keno! : CHECK - A place where bands can play: CHECK - Bartenders: CHECK  It's a nice awesome dive bar that has everything a dive bar should have:  sports stuff, keno, gambling, bands apparently.  All good stuff."}
{"text":"Absolutely a joke compared to what it used to be.   Management is clueless. Servers and bartenders are clueless. Bar special was $2.99 for miller lite and then bartender told me it was $3.25 after the first one I bought was $3 even. Price must have went up in the hour I was there. Sandwiches were jokes. Barely a handful of chips. Bar glasses smelled of skunk. When was the last time the tap lines were cleaned? $5.50 for a short Sam Adams????? I know this is a dive bar, but the girls working there are clueless clueless clueless. Can't make a drink. Can't find the beers. Can't remember orders.   Ever hear of Jon Taffer? Read his book. Never going back."}
{"text":"It's a dump, and I wouldn't have it any other way.  This may be the one place in the Cleveland metropolitan area were I have not run into a douchebag wearing Ed Hardy/Affliction/Tapout.  In other words, you'll find real salt of the earth people here doing what should be done in a tavern...drinking."}
{"text":"Don't even bother. If I could give 0 stars I would. The place wasn't too packed of  Friday night around 9, and my group of 4 took a seat at a table. Waitress came over in a huff, took drink orders and left. Drinks took about 15 mins to get to us (we only ordered beer and wine), and then we never saw our Waitress again. Seriously. We sat there for 45 mins (talking and catching up, but still our Waitress should have returned at some point). I finally have to go try and get her from talking to her coworker at the bar. It was absolutely ridiculous. She then seemed mad that we were ready to leave after not being seen or spoken to by her for FORTY FIVE MINUTES. Yes, I'd love to stay in such a welcoming, friendly and continue to receive such great service (sarcasm, for those we missed it).   Save your time, and over expensive drinks (6 bucks for a short blue moon, dream on friend)."}
{"text":"Ok, being from California I didn't think I would ever find Dollar Pints.  They have them here.  Wen't here on a whim, doesn't look like much from the outside and is your typical Bar on the inside.  Pool tables in back some Pub tables and a Bar in front with a small stage for I am assumiung local bands.  We went on a Friday night and it was a very good time.  They had Kareoke and an awesome mix of people.  Just an all around fun atmosphere.  Even it was our first time there it didn't seem like it.  We felt welcomed and had a great time the Staff was friendly and even when it got really packed they always made it around to the table.  We will definately be going back."}
{"text":"A 4-5 on the dive bar scale. Always crowded with lots of dive bar regulars. Decent bar food. Low prices. Good and sassy service. (Love it!)   Not fine dining. Burger is solid. Good fries. Always had fast service even when it was packed. Smoking patio just off bar. Big parking lot with enough space."}
{"text":"The best hole-in-the-wall bar in Westlake. As all the other reviews said, it is a dive bar. But they have good drinks, decent beer, inviting environment, and good bartenders."}
{"text":"Today was the Grand Reopening. So happy to be able to go back to my favorite dive bar. Great staff as well as a plethora of drink and food specials. But it is a dive bar so if you're looking for more than that this is not the place for you. But if you are looking for a laid back hole in the wall with good old fashioned bar food and an excellent beer menu this is the place for you. So go in and help this local staple get back to its former glory."}
{"text":"dover gardens is fine. nice that it has reopened. interior has been modernized and renovated very nicely. male dominated crowd. menu is very limited currently."}
{"text":"I'm glad the place is open again. No frills type place. Open atmosphere now that they redid the place.  Eight or so beers on tap, nothing to go crazy over.  The wings are really good.  You can play keno here which is a plus."}
{"text":"In a city overrun with all sorts of corporate restaurants and drinking establishments the Dirty Gardens is a true gem. I had my first drink here in 1996 and I can tell you nothing has really changed except for the bar stools and they cleaned/painted the ceilings and walls. Oh and the driveway is not gravel anymore. It has since been paved. P.S. don't try and learn how to ride a motorcycle buzzed and on gravel.  They have really stepped up their game as far as craft beer selection and taking care of their tap system while maintaining that old school Brothel feel. Yes this was a Brother way back in the day and I am pretty sure this is the oldest standing structure in Westlake. Stop in and sing or watch people make fools of themselves on the weekends singing Karaoke with Marie. The infux of collared custies that someone spoke of in previous reviews are people exiling from the Ironwood down the street. Nobody will or should pay those prices for bottled craft beer. Or the $6.50 or $7 they think they can charge for a Guinness."}
{"text":"Love this place! I go here for lunch a lot as my office is right down the street. Their perch sandwich is outstanding. The perch comes with melted cheese on it with outstanding tartar sauce on the side. The fries are amazing as well. The staff here is very friendly, attentive and fun to chat with."}
{"text":"One of my favorite neighborhood bars! Bartenders are more than friendly and the food is good and reasonably priced. We go here multiple times a month and the bartenders now remember us! I highly reccomend this place!"}
{"text":"My favorite local bar!! Very friendly and attentive bartenders, inexpensive drinks, and delicious food."}
{"text":"Great local bar newly reopened from calamity. Nice open feel, friendly tenders and as always great food!"}
{"text":"After all this time and a great makeover its still a punch palace. Monday night fight club breaks out at the bar and coupled with horrible service Its gonna be a long time before I return."}
{"text":"We were told the cook would be back in 10-15 minutes and we would receive our food order then because there was no one to cook it. When we got our food, it was cold and not made fresh. Very disappointing. Either the cook never came back and they warmed up leftovers for us or...the cook came back and warmed leftovers for us. It was already quite late at this point or I would have sent the order back. The service was prompt and courteous but the food was such a disappointment that we left most of it untouched. I can't recommend a bar that serves old food."}
{"text":"I still love this place, but what happened???  Everyone there was wearing shirts with collars and they had decent beers on tap.    Something is wrong with this picture...  they are about to lose their \"dive bar\" status.  Good burgers, nice and greasy!  Cheap food and cheap drinks.  Just don't wear a shirt with a collar."}
{"text":"The closest thing to a dive bar in Westlake. Cozy atmosphere, pool table, enough TVs and patio, Dover Gardens will get the job done. Standard bar food menu with daily specials. The garlic buffalo wings stand out. So does the fried fish sandwich (when available), surprisingly!"}
{"text":"I love that this place is open again. We were so upset when it closed due to the accident. This was the place that we could walk to from our apartment and have a good time. Definitely will continue to return here because the service is great, we love the atmosphere and we really like the local feel.   Definitely a place worth a try."}
{"text":"It a great hole-in-the-wall bar with even better food. The kitchen appears to be clean and the food comes out fast. The bar is casual and welcoming but can get loud because it's tiny. I would recommend this bar to anyone who loves to drink socially and enjoy quality food."}
{"text":"cool little dive spot. Dig the re-build. just what you expect from a local bar. Good service, nice prices fun times. grab your friends and head out to the dove like i do. great place to play some darts. there is almost always someone that is playing. its nice to see a place like that get so much business. always a great time there. Staff is awesome, food is good."}
