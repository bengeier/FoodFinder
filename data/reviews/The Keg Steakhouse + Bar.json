{"text":"Very nice restaurant, upscale, a little pricy for the area and for a family of four, Very good food, fantastic people that are on the ball and very helpful. Been there four times and very consistent with their service. Thumbs-up for the chef."}
{"text":"Updating my review of The Keg:
I'm raising my 2 star to a 4 star. I've been in touch with the owner of the restaurant for the last week. Now, I haven't been back yet, but the simple fact that the owner of the chain has taken it upon herself to contact me in regards to some of my \"complaints\" give me faith that real people still exist and actually care about what happens in their businesses as well as what people are saying about their businesses. Service not just while at the restaurant, but after I've left the restaurant is equally important.

Kudos"}
{"text":"great service!

i brought my company here for a happy hour, and i knew it would be packed.  so i called ahead, and the hostess reserved us a table for 6.  when i got there, the table was all ready for us.  terrific scratch made drinks and happy hour food.  we had margaritas made with herradura, my favorite tequila.  the apps are a cut above your normal bar food; the wings are perfect.  everyone loved it..

ive had dinner here a few times as well, and i always find it a great value for the level of service and quality of food.  great consistency each time.  will bring everyone back soon."}
{"text":"I came here to celebrate my wedding anniversary and birthday. Ordered two alcoholic beverages, Caesar salad, cheesy garlic bread, rib steaks. We had a few things go wrong during dinner, but in all honesty the food was spot on. The salad was cool and crisp. The cheesy garlic bread was bubbly hot, crispy, yet soft and chewy. The steaks were flavored incredibly, and the sides were just as hot as the rest of the dish. Also, everything came out in a very timely manner. We could very well critique things that went wrong, but there were too many great tasting things that outweighed the negative. I highly recommend this location, as you can also expect friendly faces, and gorgeous ambience. These guys are doing it right. We are so glad we came here, great job!"}
{"text":"We were seated right away for dinner service and the hostess was very friendly and let us know about specials going on for the night. Tim was our waiter and he was great! He let us know about everything on the menu along with recommendations and if we had any questions. He was also able to achieve our requests. 

I ordered the mondo sized prime rib with Alaskan crab legs and it was amazing! My girlfriend's steak was done to perfection as well. We had a great time and will most defiantly be back."}
{"text":"This was our 3rd visit to the Keg and we were thoroughly impressed again....service was great and the Manager Tim was fantastic! The Baked Brie appetizer is possibly the reason I return each time....it is amazing! The Filet Mignon was one of the most tender steaks i've ever had and It was cooked to perfectiom. My husbands brownie desert was really really good (and I don't usually like brownies). I cannot say enough about the politeness and attentiveness of the Manager Tim, he made such a great impression."}
{"text":"Servers name was Ricardom. This man was the absolute best waiter I have ever experienced in my life.  Very clean cut, well dressed, well manacured dude.  All staff was extremely professional and the food was amazing.  When you eat out you don't just expect good food...youu want good service as well.   You will get that hete,at least if your server is Ricardo.  Thanks man."}
{"text":"Amazing food as always. Great steak and a very classy place to eat. The portions are not huge but very good. Low lighting inside so it's romantic. The service is good and the people who usually go are usually rich."}
{"text":"There are many things to love about the keg.  The sour dough bread that comes with the meal is awesome.  The outdoor patio is great when the weather permits and the bar area is quite cozy.  The main entrees themselves are average to good.  I had the full rack of ribs.  They were fall of the bone which I like, but didn't have much flavor and were more fatty than I like.  My friend ordered the prime rib which was considerably better, but was slightly overcooked.  It did have excellent flavor though.  Our server was amazing.  He was very friendly, knew the specials well and didn't badger us with lots of up-selling.  All in all a good experience!"}
{"text":"We have dinner here every time we come down to the Valley from Show Low. The GREAT food, WONDERFUL service and LOVELY atmosphere keep us coming back time and again."}
{"text":"Usually love the Keg. 

This one however was a different story. Server was exceptionally rude. And just never really checked on us and at the beginning she never asked if I wanted anything to drink. We cut dinner off early because she was just so awkward. 
My food was actually burnt which was a huge surprise for the Keg, considering I usually leave 100% satisfied."}
{"text":"Very impressive service. Received undercooked entre,  but the staff was apologetic and made it right. Very happy with the experience."}
{"text":"Service was good, the waiter was helpful and offered hints about the menu.  We ordered wine and another waiter came by to talk wine as well, so we had plenty of positive feedback and support.  He even recommended another wine they said was popular and went to get a sample for us to taste.

I ordered the New York medium rare, it came out medium.  However I usually have to figure out how a place cooks when you travel as much as I do, as some regions have slightly different standards due to the expectations of the local clientele.  Next time I would order it rare, and they gave me a pile of asparagus, so there was no lacking of veggies.

Atmosphere was good, and we were able to hold a conversation without having to speak loudly to be heard.  We were seated immediately upon arrival, and we did have a reservation.  I booked through opentable."}
{"text":"Went to this location last night to celebrate my birthday. I was so impressed by EVERY staff member and how polite and professional they all were. We interacted with the hostesses, bartenders, our server, and a manager and every single one of them was truly awesome. 
Great food, great wine, and great dessert. Will definitely come back when we want a nice steak place!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend! You definitely want to sit in the bar, the servers and service are incredible. Food is tastey and I was helped by Alexis and Shane and they were both helpful and a pleasure to be around.  Keep up the good work and the incredible customer service"}
{"text":"The service was incredibly slow and it's for this that it lost a star. Eventually we got a wine list and then it took ages to order our wine and food. There was also a long gap between ordering and getting our food. The staff were very friendly and polite so I definitely wouldn't fault them on that, it was just very slow. The wine was very good. The steak was perfectly cooked for us (rare) and it was incredible. The best steak I've ever had. It was so succulent, tender and tasty. I love pepper sauce on steak but hardly had any on this as it seemed a shame to hide the taste of the actual steak. 

This would have been 5 stars without a doubt if the service was quicker."}
{"text":"We love this place. The service is excellent, the food is outstanding, and the prices are very reasonable. The ambiance is always warm and inviting. The filet mignon is always cooked as requested. Of course, the twice baked potato is a must."}
{"text":"After my graduation from ASU, the hubby brought me to the Keg Steakhouse to celebrate. What a wonderful dinning experience! We were seated within five minutes of arriving, without reservations. The staff was courteous and even though they had nothing to do with us, like serving us or seating us, they greeted us and thanked us for coming. The food was excellent! I had the bacon wrapped filet mignon with whiskey peppercorn sauce and the Atlantic lobster tails, yum. The hubby had the prime rib which was just as amazing as the filet mignon. And my teenage son had the top sirloin steak with the lobster tails, which he loved. Jordan our waiter was the best! Truly a great experience."}
{"text":"We took our friend to this restaurant to celebrate her birthday.

     When we arrived we had a drink in the lounge. I ordered a Manhattan - \"up\".  I tried to tell the cocktail waitress how I liked it to be prepared.  Before I could do so, she said \"I know, I know, I know'.  From this point I knew there would be a problem.  She wouldn't listen.  (I like a traditional Manhattan  with two parts bourbon, one part Sweet Vermouth, a dash of bitters and stirred in ice and poured)  The Manhattan  was served wrong.  It was made with dry vermouth,no bitters and shaken.  I didn't complain as I didn't want to create a confrontation at our friend's birthday celebration.  The bartender (with purple dyed hair) confused this drink with a martini.  I should have ordered a beer or glass of wine or just ice water.

     The lounge played very loud rockie rollo music making it difficult to converse.

      We were seated outside and I must say that the atmosphere was very nice. We enjoyed a nice Arizona evening complete with a blazing fireplace.  Very nice.

     I ordered the prime rib dinner.  I was very excited until I was served.  This was the worst piece of prime rib that I have ever had.  It was paper thin and half of the weight was probably due to the bone.  The meat was rather tough.  The twice baked potatoe was barely warm.  The vegetables were OK.  The salad was very small, \"el cheapo\".  I must say that the horseradish sauce was excellent!

     My wife had a baked potatoe and it looked great complete with bacon bits, chives and sour cream.  That was nice.

     In honor of our friend's birthday, the restaurant served her a piece of cream pie  complete with a lit candle. The staff all sang the \"Happy Birthday Song\". The waitress that sang that song next to me had a very beautiful voice! That was nice.  The cream pie tasted like a concoction of cool whip and Food Club instant pudding!

     I  can't understand how this restaurant can get all those five star ratings.  I gave it two stars .  One star for the baked potatoe and one star for the horseradish sauce!

Thank you for reading!"}
{"text":"I have been here about 5 times. Every time I go, they do a great service. The staff is always helpful and create a great atmosphere. Defiantly worth the $$$$."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good but not the best I've had. One thing that I hated was the very loud music playing that made it sounds like I was in a club rather than a steakhouse. I wouldn't mind the music in the bar and the patio but definitely not in the dining room! Service was great; very long wait tho. Overall I don't think I'll be a regular at The Keg but maybe occasionally."}
{"text":"I love this location.  Class all the way!  You can't lose with the Keg.  Food is fabulous and my baseball cut steak is always perfect!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately the Keg let us down last night.  We have been going to this location for many years and have also had wonderful meals. The restaurant was moderately busy and the staff was slammed. We waited for water, drinks and bread. 

Our meal was delivered and my 1/2 lobster was mangled. I'm not sure how it was allowed out of the kitchen. I sent it back immediately. A manager apologized and cooked a new lobster. By the time it was replaced my dinner was nearly finished. No compensation was offered.  The veggies were overlooked as well. All in all just an average meal."}
{"text":"My husband (of 17 years) and I have a date night once a week without the kids. Our favorite thing to do is sit at the bar and have appetizers with a beer. 
Very over priced. The apps were okay and took just over 30 minutes to get to us.
 It seems the bar area is where some of the staff members like to air their grievances about customers. Waiters (not waitresses) were very loud and unprofessional, telling the bartender how \"difficult\" their table is. One guy is a loud, foul mouth. We wanted to leave. 
Maybe it was just an off night? Who knows. But our bill was over $60.00 for appetizers and 3 domestic draft beers. We will absolutely never go there again."}
{"text":"I have been a guest here before, but it's been over a year since my last visit.  I have always thought this place was a great mid-tier steakhouse.  The Keg fits that niche between Outback and higher-end steakhouses like Fleming's.  Great bar, good selection of appetizers; big selection of steaks at reasonable prices.  I usually sit at the bar, but this past Wednesday the bartop was full so I picked a cocktail table.  My server was Alex.  She was lovely, attentive, and had solid menu knowledge.  I just had a couple of appetizers, but her suggestions were spot on.  Service was great, food was great, so why only 4 stars?  The manager on duty looked horrific.  I am normally not one to judge based on appearances, but this man looked like a homeless person forced into a suit.  His facial hair was scraggly and unkempt, and his hair looked greasy and filthy.  I don't know if the other guests notice this guy, but I can't believe that this restaurant wants its guests to see this manager.  Not the way to represent yourself to the public."}
{"text":"Awesome, awesome, awesome ! 

I had the filet with melted blue cheese on top, wrapped in bacon, and it was soo good. Also, I tried there kiwi martini and would highly recommend that. The server was great, and didn't try and hurry us out the door despite being busy. Also, some how the manager got word that it was our first time there and brought us complementary shrimp cocktail, how nice ! The steaks were cooked to our liking and were brought out in a timely manner, I definitely recommend this place !"}
{"text":"4 of us went to dinner tonight at The Keg.  Megan was our server, she was awesome.  2 out fo the 4 of us order the Foundation Special, it was Prime Rib and prosciutto wrapped shrimp.  When our meal came out there was this odor coming from the 2 plates.  The prosciutto wrapped shrimp had a very strange odor.  It smelled like WET DOG! BAD! to the point that we didn't want to smell it anymore, and it kept wafting towards us.  At the end of the meal we had the shrimp set aside, 2 tried the shrimp, NASTY, it tasted like it smelled.  We informed Megan and she went and got the manager, she agreed with us that it smelled gross.  JOSH the manager came over and said \"I expected this, I thought it smelled funny!\"  My husband asked him \"why did you let this come out to our table if you noticed the smell?\"   Josh was a douche about the whole thing.  He took off both meals, still he did not own up to his \"management\" mistake, Megan you were very nice and a great server so thank you, JOSH get your head out of your ass and do you job.  If you keep sending out nasty food, you wont have a job anymore!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Kegs in Oregon (long gone now), Canada and now Arizona. The taste of their food is very consistent and the quality is always awesome. I just had dinner at the Phoenix Keg and am looking forward to my next visit! Great food, excellent service, cool atmosphere :)"}
{"text":"First time going here, last minute decision because I was hungry and in the area. Went in on Saturday eve without a reservation would have been a 40 minute wait. They have a full service bar with sports playing on big screen televisions and a cozy fireplace. Chose the bar instead of the wait and food was quick and delicious. Bar tender seemed to be rushing us to leave after I finished my plate. My friend was still eating off of hers and she asked one too many times if we were done. Felt a bit uncomfortable. But I'd go back."}
{"text":"Natalie was our bartender and she did an amazing job. My wife and I came in for some drinks and sat at the bar. An older man came up to the bar and orders a drink from her. He was sitting at a table in the bar area where they already had a server. Natalie was very polite and was asking him who his drinks were for. He became impatient and rude immediately. She made 2 drinks for him and the second drink he shouted at her that is was not a \"full\" drink. He refused to pay for it so my wife and I stepped in and took the drink from this RUDE patron. My wife had a similar drink in front of her and side by side the drinks were of equal amounts. Natalie handled this rude person with amazing professionalism. Natalie was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Been here quite a few times, and the food is always excellent! The crowd can be a little rough but bang for the buck pretty good value. So no need to feel like you have to dress up when many of the patrons have T-shirts and multiple tattoos and piercings all over their faces."}
{"text":"bad food (i actually got indigestion later that night and it didn't even TASTE good, if i'm getting a sour stomach, i at least want it to be well worth it) 
bad prices ($150.00, one mid-range wine you could buy for 20$ at Bevmo, 6 beers and 2 vodka martinis)
bad bartenders (we had to practically grovel to get any kind of service and her male sidekick wasn't any better) 
bad waiter (too busy to talk and chat, and the room was EMPTY) 
what more can i say???"}
{"text":"Exceptional is the only word that comes to mind, we came here for a turkey dinner on Thanksgiving day. 

We started with their own sour dough baked bread which was tasty and then a ceasar salad which was very fresh and tossed in some sort of delicious dressing. 

I forgot to ask what that was, lol.

The turkey dinner itself was amazing! No dry chewy turkey here! It was moist, melt in your mouth and seasoned to perfection.

Our waitress Claire was not only beautiful! But also very attentive and professional!

I love this place! You will not be disappointed, the staff are amazing... Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Delicious food at a reasonable value, super friendly and professional wait staff, very clean, and nice atmosphere without being pretentious.  The \"Classic Dinner\" options state that they come with Caesar salad, mixed vegetables, and baked potato, but they are very accommodating and you can easily substitute another salad and/or potato choice.

The wedge salad is great, assuming you enjoy bleu cheese... the bacon-wrapped filet, well, what can I say - when you wrap one kind of meat with another kind of meat, you can't go wrong!  Even the standard baked potato was delish.  For dessert, they have these great shot glass desserts that would give you just a taste of something sweet, but of course I had to go all out and get a full-sized dessert.  The name of the dessert I got was something like \"Billy Miner Pie.\"  Mocha ice cream on an oreo pie crust sprinkled with toasted almonds - divine!

Try this place... it's good stuff!"}
{"text":"This place is a lil bit of awesomeness! The food was great, the service was awesome, and the atmosphere was very nice! What's not to like about a great steakhouse that serves great food and provides awesome service."}
{"text":"Prime rib check....rice...check....atmosphere....check. This place is great shopping the a piece of prime rib. What's not to love. The Keg never fails me."}
{"text":"I have been going to The Keg Steak House now ever since they first opened. I have enjoyed everything from the ambiance  to the wonderful food and the servers are great. I highly recommend this restaurant. Alot of quality for the price."}
{"text":"Another grand slam for steak lovers. Nestled away closer to the Chandler fashion center is the Keg. If you're a fine dinner who enjoys wine, you'll really love the extensive wine list. Your server will act almost like a sommelier. Once you've made your selection they'll almost do everything but drink it for you, heck I think they might even know what tree, fruits, or even the row the vines were grown in. It's just a really neat way to present the wine which I find interesting.

The food was wonderful along with the bread. I had a sirloin cooked to perfection and yes, of course more potatoes. The Ceaser salad rocks one of the best I've had thus far in the valley. Service is never pushy and you'll have plenty of time to enjoy your meal whether with friends, family, or if your say in the romantic mood to treat your lady friend, trust me fellas go to the Keg.

{"text":"This review is mostly based off of happy hour.  I haven't really been for dinner service outside of the bar area, so I'll keep my review to what I know.

Good happy hour drinks.  Orange slice martini is fantastic, nice and smooth and just the right amount of citrus-y sweetness.  The margarita is quite nice as well, just not as much of a standout as the orange slice.  They have good prices on glasses of wine and beer as well - that being said, we always return to the orange slice.  

The bar menu isn't great, but it isn't a detriment either.  Nachos are standard bar nachos with generic chips, overly lime-y guacamole and a light layer of cheese.  Nothing special.  

The Prime Rib sandwich is tender and tasty.

I do love the house-made potato chips that they serve free in the bar area.  Quite tasty and nicely salted.  

Go for the drinks, get a couple snacks - but don't expect too much from the food.  Service has always been reliable and pleasant if not outstanding."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of the Keg for years, but my recent experiences have been so poor that I will not be coming back. 

The staff is professional and well-trained, the ambience is enjoyable and the restaurant is always clean, however the quality of food is severely lacking. 

I ordered a filet mignon, known to be the leanest and most tender cut off beef on the menu. It was well seasoned and served at the proper temperature, but the meat itself was nearly inedible. Extremely fatty and full of gristle, I cut hardly cut through it, much less chew. At $32 a plate, I expect a much better piece of meat. I'm getting Denny's quality meat at City Hall prices. Call it what you will, but this is a rip-off. I'll be taking my business somewhere else from now on."}
{"text":"This was my second and LAST time to visit The Keg.  The food is always decent, and good selection of cocktails too.  But the service was terrible.  We were seated on the patio along with several other guests, but for some reason our server only had one table on the patio - us.  And she constantly forgot about us.  It took about 30 minutes to get our drinks and place our order.  The food was out in reasonable time (someone else delivered it).  But then no check to see if everything looks good, is as-ordered, nada.  After we got our food, we didn't see her again for 30 minutes!  Our food was gone, but empty plates remained.  Our first round of cocktails was long gone (and we would have had more if offered).  By the time she came out to bring us our check even our waters were bottomed out!  She brought the check with no apology and didn't offer to refill drinks, and left the dirty and obviously empty plates.  We gave her our credit card right away fearing we may not see her again for another hour.  And if you can believe it we sat for another 30 minutes after giving her our card!  At this point, we missed the movie we were hoping to catch and we were not happy.  She came back out to patio, saw us, and rudely asked \"did she not bring you the check?!?\"... we say, \"ummm no\" thinking, obvioulsy not, we are still here amongst dirty dishes and empty glasses... she stormed off with a huff and no explanation or apology.  The manager brought out our final check a few minutes later and did end up apologizing for the internal miscommunication, and offered to buy us another round of drinks.  We passed; after sitting for 2 hours at this place we wanted to run far far away.  IMO he shouldn't have charged us for the first round of drinks when he personally ran our card.  But no, he went ahead and charged us full price for everything with only an offer for a couple of drinks.  We will NEVER eat here again.  Terrible service."}
{"text":"My wife and I come here all the time and the service is always top notch, but the food is amazing. Steaks are always cooked perfectly. Love it!"}
{"text":"This is by far the most awesome steak house I have ever been too.  Ana C recommended the mushrooms neptune and that was amazing.  Please try it.
Food was prepared rather quickly.  The drinks were phenominal.  And the garlic mashed potatoes.  YUM.  I'm all hungry again."}
{"text":"Went here this past Tuesday with my wife.  We arrived at about 6:45; we didn't have a reservation and the place was PACKED.  The hostess offered to put our name on the list and told us it would be about 45 minutes.  We had her put out name down, and we went to the bar to grab a drink before happy hour ended at 7.  I believe the drink specials were $4 wells and beers, $6 wine and selected cocktails.  She had a wine, I had a Keg Margarita.  The margarita was nothing special, but I'm a bit of a tequila/margarita snob.

We managed to find table in the bar area large enough to accommodate my in-laws, who met us around 7.  I ordered the 8-oz top sirloin dinner ($28, I believe).  It came with a salad, a baked potato (that I loaded with toppings) , and about 2 bites of asparagus.  I ordered it medium-rare, and it was cooked perfectly.  The steak was juicy and tasty; I saved some to take home with me.

My wife got the crab legs.  She's really into crab legs generally; me, not so much.  She enjoyed them.

Overall, a pretty good place.  My wife and I paid about $90 after tax and tip for 2 full meals, 1 drink each, and split a shrimp cocktail with my in-laws.  Because we were in the bar area, it was a bit loud, but that didn't bother me.  We had a good time, and I'll definitely go back for happy hour at some point.  It's a bit on the pricey side for dinner, but a pretty good \"occasions\"-place.

Get a reservation EARLY if you want to sit in the dining room, even midweek."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed the atmosphere and steaks every time I have been here.  They have always cooked my steak the way I wanted the first time."}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend here for his birthday. The service was good, but the food was mediocre at best. It was overpriced for the food. It's sad to say, but my steamed asparagus was the best part of the meal. I had a Caesar salad, prime rib, and steamed asparagus. My boyfriend had the bacon wrapped chicken. The seasoning was not consistent across the different foods on the plate, too salty or too bland. I was saddened with how much we paid for such a disappointing meal, but you live and learn. I'll very likely never go back."}
{"text":"Food was great NY steak & Wedge salad cooked perfect. Service was excellent I highly recommend dining here. Sit iin the bar great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Good food, but a place named after a beer vessel that doesn't have a beer list, respect beer, or educate their staff. 

A shame, if they fix it I'll improve my rating."}
{"text":"Went to this place last night and it was outstanding. I ordered the blackened salmon dish with twice baked potato. Cooked to perfection will be going again soon!! Need more beers on tap"}
{"text":"We love the keg. Great happy hour. Great deal on happy hour wine. The bar is always fun and I am not sure we have ever had a bad server. It's probably 1 step below the highest end steak houses but for the price you get incredible value."}
{"text":"Every time I come here I am not disappointed. This is my choice for every birthday, celebration or fancy night out. Although it maybe expensive, it is definitely worth it! Their Filet Mignon wrapped in bacon is amazing. Have that with the Crème Brûlée as dessert and you will be completely satisfied!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing!!!!! I was in Toronto over Memorial Day weekend for a nice getaway. Visited The Keg on Sunday night. Received excellent service, probably the best service I have ever received in a restaurant! We ordered the calamari as an appetizer and it was some of the best I have ever had. Our waitress was very knowledgable and was able to suggest local wine and beer. I ordered the filet and shrimp and my friends ordered the steak  and lobster. Both dishes were amazing. By far the best steak I have ever eaten. I also indulged in the miner's pie and I would go back just for that! I forget my waitresses name but she was wonderful. If I could give more stars I would."}
{"text":"My frustration level is increasing, so just let me vent for just a minute or 2... Now, I have been to the Keg twice in the past week. How is it that they always run out of the happy hour chips or they throw them away? Really? And why does it take asking 2 different people and then find out they just went in the garbage. Ok I will let that go now!!! 

Well on this particular visit, it was a bit quieter, not a hip hoppin night that is for sure. I again had a nice glass of wine complimented with the goat cheese and salsa. Yes that was intentional that I put that the goat cheese complimented the wine! I wish they would bring back the flat bread though. There isn't much on the appetizer menu that I care for, so I am limited on that part of the menu. They could be a little more generous with the melba toasts on the goat cheese appetizer. And the key lime pie was delicious again. Though it did appear there was a little bite missing from the end. Maybe our bartender was a little hungry:)"}
{"text":"On Tuesday for happy hour we decided to give the keg another try. The last time I came was not really great.
We sat on the patio (first time and I wonder why I  didn't do it before !). We ordered to our fantastic waitress 2 glasses of pinot (Noir for me, Gris for my daughter). Can you believe 9oz of good wine for only $8 ? Then we had the bake brie (yummy) and the prime rib sliders  (just perfect with a little bit of horseradish).
Eureka  !! We just found our perfect happy hour !!
Did I mention that our waitress Andra J was great ? Always wondering how we were doing if we need anything...  
I will come back again for sure"}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times and have always extremely enjoyed it. Came here for my first anniversary and everything was perfect! The food came out relatively quickly the wine was a nice age and the service was stupendous. The overall atmosphere was extremely classy. The general manager came over to make sure everything was perfect, which he has every single time we have been there. Overall most satisfying restaurant I have ever been to."}
{"text":"My wife and frequent The Keg often.  Originally from Canada,  it's nice to have a local steak house.  I've never had a bad steak or meal there.  Top service too!"}
{"text":"Very nice steakhouse. Great ambiance. Very nice staff. Our waiter AJ was great. The food was very good. I expected my steak to be more tender. But everyone else in our large party only had good things to say."}
{"text":"This place has a nice atmosphere and a nice happy hour. Wine list is decent. A must App is the baked goat cheese with almonds and tomato basil salsa. Their sirloin and twice baked potato is also very good. Great place to go with friends, enjoy a happy hour or din for two!"}
{"text":"This place is great the atmosphere is pretty nice and the cocktail waitresses are smoking hot. The prime rib is fabulous and have always had a great meal.  Great steak house!"}
{"text":"We ate here during a business trip as the restaurant was across the street from our hotel. Everyone ordered steak. I had the petite (7 oz) filet and it was superb. I ordered it medium and it was exactly that. The salads are huge. I really liked my twice baked potato and vegetables. The bread was typical white loaf bread, but since it was hot and fresh it worked. The dessert menu looked amazing, but I was too full from my meal to indulge. I was surprised by how dark it was inside, but I guess it makes for a more romantic atmosphere (when on a date). Our waiter was very nice and service was fast in my opinion given we were a group of 7. I felt bad for the hostesses, who walk around in hot shorts and tank tops (all black) while the servers wear pants, white button ups, and ties. Had it been a Hooter's, their attire would have been more understandable."}
{"text":"I went to this place with high hopes on my wife's birthday, and we were not disappointed!

Being from South-Africa originally where we are some of the biggest red meat-eaters in the world I have been craving a good steak for the entire 1 1/2 years I have been in the USA, and this was the first place where I found one !

I loved the look of the place and the atmosphere and the service was excellent.

Both our dishes were fantastic. I had the creme brule for dessert, my wife got the Billy Miner Pie and I think that she made the better choice. That must be the best dessert I have tasted in a very long time !"}
{"text":"Brought an date here on Saturday and it was awesome. Took some time to find it as Yelp gave us the wrong location. Its in Tempe Market Place by the north-west entrance. Walking in we were told the wait for an indoor table was 15-20min but the bar and outdoor areas are free seating. We chose outside and they even had a smoking area.
Service was great and since we were the first guest to sit outside, the turned on the misters and promptly came back to take our order. And the food was awsome. Being a professional cook I was impressed by this steak house that can ACTUALLY prepare a steak to MY order. I got the New York Stip and she had the prime rib. The prime rib was the Shizzle for rizzle. They even had a great local beer selection along with the domestics. 
It does get a little pricey but the atmosphere is great, food is better, and they even have Escargo (not bad for snails lol). 
Definitely bringing her back here. And its a great place to start a bar-hopping plan."}
{"text":"I arrived in Toronto after a long flight from Germany by way of Iceland. Having a 14 hour layover I did not want to spend the night in the airport, so I checked into TravelLodge for the down time. On the shuttle to the hotel I noticed The Keg next door. I said to my niece/travel buddy, \"That looks like a good place to eat.\" After checking in we made the pilgrimage next door and treated ourselves to an excellent meal. I had the best steak I have ever eaten in a restaurant in addition to extremely fast and good service."}
{"text":"The service was amazing! Our drinks were never empty and the staff and management made rounds several times to make sure everything was good. The prime rib was delicious, definitely one of our favorite steakhouses!"}
{"text":"Went there for my husbands birthday last night. First time for him. Second time for me. First off.. the staff is wonderful. Our waiter, Bernardo, was friendly, funny and helpful. My husband ordered the prime rib which they were unfortunately out of. He ordered the fillet instead. My comment was awww.. that is what he wanted..and it's his birthday. Didn't think anything of it until the manager came over and said, since it was my husbands birthday and they didn't have his first choice, his meal was on the house. Wow.. did not see that coming nor did we expect it. It was, however, very much appreciated. My husband also suffers from Celiac disease. So gluten is a big no no (they have a great GF menu btw.) After we finished our meal Bernardo comes over to us and lets us know they usually provide a dessert for customers who come in for their birthday. Let's us know what his GF choices were. The steaks were some of the best I've had. The service was great. You can tell the friendly banter between the staff makes it a great place to work too."}
{"text":"I'm not a red meat eater, but my best friend was in town and was craving a steak. I had no idea where to take her. Another friend suggested this place because it was close and she had only been here for drinks. We decided to be adventurous and give it a shot. The friend who suggested the place decided to meet us.

We were seated immediately and although I was a little disappointed that we were seated in the hallway, next to the kitchen door and across from two other tables that we had to face because our table was horseshoe shaped, the seats were far back enough that the kitchen door didn't bother me. I was still a little conscientious of the other two tables with people staring at us though. Strike one.... horrible table.  Get it out of there.

Strike one was redeemed with a fabulous waiter. He was attentive, and we never had empty glasses or plates once we ordered. We received bread, appetizers, salads, entrees and refills with no hitch. 

I wasn't impressed with the appetizer, but it wasn't their fault. I just can't see myself ever having shrimp with cheese ever again. I thought it was weird when I ordered it, but was curious. Curiosity satisfied.

We received our salads and entrees and dug in. My friend's steak was cooked to her liking and loved her seafood with it. She said everything was what she was craving and expecting. Coming from her, that's a huge complement. My other friend was equally happy with her slab of meat.

My entree was the chicken oscar, which has shrimp and scallops on top in a Bearnaise sauce. Took one bite of the scallops and shrimp.... oh my. Yummmmm. Scallops were cooked perfectly. I love scallops that melt in your mouth. The vegetables were cooked perfectly. Still crispy, not over-cooked. Then I get to the chicken and this is where strike two happens. The chicken was so salty that I couldn't even finish the second bite. Luckily, I was full from the veggies, scallops and shrimp and mashed potatoes I ate. When the waiter asked if he could take my plate and I said yes, he asked if there was something wrong with the chicken. So, being honest, I told him. At this point, I'm full, fat, dumb and happy so I declined his offer to replace it with something else. 

Then here's where they redeemed themselves on strike two. Even though I told him it was unnecessary, the manager came over and apologized to all three of us. He looked at me and said he comped my salad and entree and then offered all three of us desserts and coffees on the house. He explained the saltiness comes from the rub the cooks use and he's asked them before not to use so much. I barely heard this because I was still astounded that not only is my entire meal free, but now desserts for all three of us too? And coffee? Who am I to turn down free coffee???

Then the manager asked me something I love to hear: Do you have any allergies? WHY YES I DO! NUTS!  He explained that I should not get these certain desserts and offered me all the nut free options. I asked him if I could marry him. It's been too long since someone in a restaurant asked me this before I could say something.

I would go back for another dinner. I know how to modify my meal to my satisfaction now. I would also recommend this place to my friends and family."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, hoping the food matches"}
{"text":"I usually try to stay away from chain restaurants at malls but we recently visited this location after taking my daughter shopping. Definitely happy that we did.

Both of us found the food enjoyable and the service was quite good. The atmosphere was nicer than I was expecting from the outside and we enjoyed our visit. 

We will try it again when we are in the area."}
{"text":"Took us awhile to get around to trying this place. Whenever we are in the area it's a no go bc of the long waiting line. But finally the stars aligned & we were whisked into a nice, roomy booth. Great ambiance. Excellent service. Actually prefered the food over other steakhouses (e.g. Sullivan's; Texas Roadhouse; Firebirds.) The ribeye and filet were perfection. Twice baked potatoes,  yummy! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Very unpredictable service and food; one time it is good, another it is bad, and the next it is great...hard to know for sure if your steak will be worth the time and money, but when they do it right it is good.  The staff appears to do a lot of socializing instead of attending to guests."}
{"text":"I've been to the Keg in the past and I signed up for their birthday list, which gives you 25 dollars that you can use towards your bill through your birthday month. Always love that. This one one such visit and we went pretty early on a Sunday evening and it wasn't very full. There were probably only a few other people near us so it was mostly quiet, which I definitely appreciated. Only real pet peeve with this place is that is is so dark! I understand wanting to keep the atmosphere a certain way but if I can barely see the person sitting across from me it isn't working for me.
Anyways, the food. My boyfriend and I each ordered a wedge salad, I had the Prime Rib and King Crab legs combo, and he got a NY Classic. The salad was crisp and nicely chilled, but the only issue was that when they had rinsed the lettuce they hadn't drained it very well and there was a lot of water in the inner layers for both of them. My boyfriend's steak was cooked to perfection and he definitely enjoyed it along with the super creamy mashed potatoes that came with it. My Prime rib was so tender it basically melted in my mouth. The crab legs were really great except for the last one which had a strange after taste.
Mostly it was all good and I had Prime Rib left over, but they didn't pack up my dipping sauce in my doogy bag."}
{"text":"I love this place for eating and happy hour. One of my favorite happy hour items is the BAKED GOAT CHEESE. Just eat it! The goat cheese is lovely, creamy and has toasted almonds on it. I also love the Orange Slice Martini. The best thing about the martini is the juice is fresh and made in the bar. 

Service has been good every time that I have gone and I love seating in the bar area. Music is also very good. They play a mix of classic rock and popular music of today."}
{"text":"Excellent service great food!! Will go back for sure!! Summer lobster menu is fabulous"}
{"text":"The bar is low light and the music moderate. Televisions are easy to see. The snack menu offers good variety and quality food. The bartender is knowledgeable and friendly."}
{"text":"Tried the prime rib which was wonderful. Our waitress was friendly and knowledgable. They have a house cream soda which was sweet and delicious. Prices a little steep but quality of food is well worth it."}
{"text":"Great steak! Great food! Great wine! My wife and I enjoy this place greatly and love to eat here. Service is great too. Ask for your steak to be peppercorn! It's awesome when they do this to any steak you pick."}
{"text":"Service was good. Filet was nice. Sea bass was incredibly fishy tasting. So if you're looking for seafood, try somewhere else. Otherwise I would return to eat a steak."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money.. I ordered a steak salad and basically got 5 cups of bagged spinach with an okay steak on top. My kids French fries were terrible and my sons kids steak was undercooked ( asked for no pink). The ranch dressing tasted like yogurt dip with dill in it.. 

But my 9 dollar margaritas were excellent and our service was amazing. Wished we had gone to Cantina Laredo instead."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant dozens of times throughout the years. I find the steaks are always good, but the seafood is really hit or miss. Was there yesterday and my lobster was totally over cooked. It was like complete rubber. It was barely edible. I should have known better to order it there, but I love surf and turf so I gave it a shot. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Delish salmon. They customized it a bit and it suited my low carb diet perfectly."}
{"text":"Came here on a date and the food was exquisite! Service was even better. Alyssa was tending to us that night and we couldn't imagine having better service. I highly recommend anyone and everyone. Thanks Alyssa, we will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"In town for a show ate here two nights at the bar. Good menu. Enjoyed the seared tuna tacos one night and 8 oz sirloin the next. Good atmosphere for the road warrior. Ruby the bartendress is fantastic. Recommended and will return."}
{"text":"If you come to this location, Brandon is a fantastic server! Personable, quick, knows his menu.

The Arizona Restaurant Week prix fixe menu is a deal! 

My husband had the Baked Garlic Shrimp, the 20oz Rib Steak, Twice Baked Potato side, and Carrot Cake - which isn't on the prix fixe menu but since they were out of créme bruleé they opened up the dessert choices.  I had the Baked Garlic Shrimp, Prime Rib Oscar, Baked Potato, and Brownie Sundae - also not a prix fixe dessert.

The garlic shrimp is good, but we both agreed it would have been better without the cheese. The shrimp is in individual containers; the bowl makes me think of an egg poaching dish. The sweet roll to sop up the garlic and melted butter left in the cups is tasty and a smart addition. 

My prime rib was fantastic, perfectly cooked with a hearty au jus. I would NOT get it oscar style again though. The scallop, shrimp, and aspagus were perfectly cooked in a delicious hollandaise. The only issue was it didn't 'go' with the prime rib flavor to me. Both were good separate, but should stay that way. The potato was a standard baked potato, small, and more places really need to learn to be like Black Angus and salt the outside for fluffier potatoes. 

My husband's Rib Steak was juicy and perfectly cooked. It had great flavor. The Twice Baked Potato was fantastic. Large, and oh so delicious! I don't usually like Twice Baked potatoes, but I will definitely get that in the future. 

Dessert, oh dessert. We were both pretty full by this time, but it was included. I was sad not to b able to try the creme bruleé, but what I got was good! I don't usually like vanilla ice cream, but Haagen daz!  The brownies were tasty, and oh so decadent. I would definitely get that again. My husband said the carrot cake was moist, sweet and delicious. I don't like carrot cake but can't say anything bad about my bite. 

Overall I'm glad we gave the Keg a second chance, especially this location. Our experience at the Tempe Marketplace location was not nearly as good. 
This is definitely going in our date night rotation! Thanks Brandon, and everyone else at the Keg :)"}
{"text":"DISGUSTING AND TRAGIC.  The service was terrible and they screwed up all of our orders, even dropping some of them at the wrong table.  The food is atrocious, and the only reason so many reviewers love this place is because they love the taste of salt.  If you like this place and eat here often, you probably have diabetes - fair warning.  I tried the crab legs in order to avoid the salt.  Instead of the mixed vegetables I ordered for a side, I got a blob of tasteless, over-salted mashed potatoes that had a nice thick skin as though they had been sitting under a heat lamp for an extended period of time.   I would have sent it back, but the pile of barely cooked bell peppers that passed for mixed vegetables on another diner's plate looked just as bad.  No shellfish fork, and no butter.  I should have let sleeping dogs lie, as the melted butter they brought tasted rancid, and I suspect is what made me sick and has me up at 2 am writing this review.  Worst of all is the price they charge for this dreck.  I could have gone to a fine dining restaurant with a chef and a seasonal menu.  Instead I got the Keg's corporate menu that has not changed for years and a line cook who's only trick is to pour on the salt.  NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation for my wife's birthday fully expecting another steak house.
Let me start with what was the best trained staff i have come across in sometime, our server showed a true interest in the menu as well as the specials. Which is why I felt comfortable ordering the lobster bisque (yes, at a steakhouse). The Lobster bisque was a treat and then I came to a salad with vinaigrette dressing that had to be prepared buy someone that understands balance of flavors. Although the prime rib that my wife ordered seemed ordinary, it was the sides from the sour dough bread to the asparagus that really impressed. Two little things I must mention are the horseradish that if not used sparingly will open your sinuses for a week and the fried onion crisp garnish, both are stand outs and helped remind me that the little things bring us back to enjoy the experience again."}
{"text":"The hospitality here was very good, well taken care of from not just our waiter Trevor, but from the whole staff, from the time walking in to leaving. The food was delicious and definitely worth visiting and coming back for. I had the trio with garlic shrimp appetizer, main entree was prime rib Oscar with twice baked potato, and a creme brulee. It was all absolutely incredible! Trevor was on top of his game and made our experience that much better, we would blink an eye and he would already have our drinks refilled without even having to ask. We had a wonderful experience here and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice and intimate. Our server was very nice (Claire) and was quick to ask us if we needed anything. We ordered the tuna tartare for an appetizer and it was good for two and yummy!! I ordered the Manhattan steak with  twiced baked potato which was amazing!! Loved the food and drinks (try the Kentucky Buck) and had a nice dinner!! Can't wait to come back soon!!"}
{"text":"I gave one star because the food was good.... Service terrible. My husband and I went out for our last date night for a while before welcoming our son into the world. We were seated quickly and a server introduced himself because our server was busy with a big party needless to say we had FOUR different servers which is ok but our appetizers bread and entrees came out within 5 minutes of eachother. Frustrating to say the least then the server came by and asked if we would like our filets put under the heat lamp while we finished our appetizers both of us enjoy our steaks medium rare/medium so a heat lamp is deff not a solution. 

I'm not one to complain but if I am going somewhere spending over $30 a plate I'd enjoy not being rushed through our entire meal. Will not be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"This place rocks for its:
1) cool setting
2) great happy hour
3) food quality

You'll see me there again...if you want cheap, the bar HH is great.  If you want a great steak, well have a seat in the restaurant."}
{"text":"The burger is the most average tasting $18 burger I've ever had in my entire life.  Asked to order it medium and was told the rule in Canada is they can only cook it well done...interesting.  Had to catch a flight and asked for it be made to go, \"we don't do take out\". How fancy....this place is average, and quite expensive.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"The food and service were excellent. The entries are in the $20 to $30 range and that gets one side (e.g., potato or vegetables). The drinks are in the $7 to $9 range. One of us had the blue cheese filet with veggies (string beans and red bell peppers) plus a baked potato (extra). The other had a prime rib with a twice-baked potato. Had one cocktail. We shared one dessert, a mocha ice cream cake with an Oreo base and a chocolate and a caramel drizzle with shaved almonds on top. Everything was done exactly as ordered and delicious and the dessert was superb. The tab was about $75."}
{"text":"I had the New York strip sirloin with baked potato. It was probably the best steak I've ever had. Loved it. Friends I was with had steak and Atlantic lobster and loved it."}
{"text":"I went to The Keg last night for the first time, and I was a little disappointed.  I ordered the filet and lobster tail, and everything on my plate came out over-cooked.  I asked for the filet to be cooked medium rare, and it came out unevenly cooked -- half was well done and the other half was medium well.  The asparagus was so over-cooked that it resembled the pressure cooked stuff that comes out of a can.  I couldn't eat it.  The lobster was the best thing on the plate, but even it was a bit rubbery.  Even if they had cooked my food correctly, I'm not sure the experience would have been much better.  The food quality is only marginally better than Outback, but the price is much higher -- more like an upscale steakhouse. If you are looking for something that's a little better than Outback, then this might be the place for you.  However, since your already paying upscale prices, I would prefer to go to somewhere like Morton's, Ruth's Chris, The Palm, or Donovan's.  At places like these, you pay for quality and you actually get it.  I'm not sure I'll go back to The Keg."}
{"text":"Wonderful evening..  Nixck, our server, was great - not too over and not too attentive.  I had the filet Oscar which was superb - melt in your mouth steak with seafood sauce.  My husband had the prime rib and lobster - very good.  It was our anniversary - they put us in a private area.  The manager came by a couple of time to check on us -very hospitable.  Great restaurant with great food"}
{"text":"Love The Keg. My wife and I go here a few times a year and love it.   

I got the Rib Steak and my wife got a Sirloin.  We got ours both \"blackened\" it's a type of spicy seasoning they put on it and we HIGHLY recommend it.

The new General Manager, Mike, is amazing !"}
{"text":"I've been going to The Keg for what I believe to be the last five years or so and I flat out love the place. It's about a ten minute drive from home and I go there to eat at least four times a month. I've always found the service to be good and the food great. My nephews and I have tried various items on the menu and have found them all to be exceptional. We have always been pleased with the size of the portions served of any and all dishes we have tried. The main reason that I like The Keg is the staff pure and simple, very attractive women. Which makes the food taste even better and the drinks even stronger! Overall, The Keg is a good place for any occasion and I'll be going there tonight!"}
{"text":"The Keg was the best dining experience my date and I have had in a very long time. We had been here a few times before but the service was out of this world this time. I had the Alaskan crab legs with garlic mashed potatoes and my date the New York strip and twice baked potato. His was cooked exactly how he likes and my crab legs were perfection. Our server Tyler was knowledgable about wine suggestions and was a pleasure to chat with. Ashley the manager was great as well and seemed to genuinely care about our experience. We will be back many times in the future!!!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I both had center cut prime rib. It was ok...surprising that it wasn't as flavorful as my previous primes here. Oh well I won't hold it against them.  Twice baked potato was tasty as always...splurged and got the Brie cheese appetizer, that was pretty tasty! 

Service was good as usual! I think our waiters name was Chris, and he was very good."}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to try this place and we are so happy we did. This was a great way to start and end our evening. Friendly service and smiles. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"This place is a perfect mix of everyday and exotic.  The food is fantastic, the service is excellent (thank you Liz!), and the prices are very reasonable to make you come back time and again!  We will definitely be back (yet again!)"}
{"text":"Our wedding anniversary we decided the Keg. Service was awesome, great cosmos and margaritas. Filet was perfect med. rare. Sea bass delicious. Manager brought house champagne for our celebration. Great touch! We will be back."}
{"text":"We were served a prime rib cut which was a top sirloin to start off. Medium for the chef was more like medium rare. Never again ... not worth my time and for the price you can go eat better at any other steakhouse."}
{"text":"The Keg rocks, and is one of the few higher end, booze-serving establishments not on my boycott list (they do not post the \"No Firearm\" sign on their door)."}
{"text":"With the price I would expect a good steak. Mine was so bland and tough that needed a razor blade to cut it. The scallops were over cooked and rubber. The other half had bacon rapped chicken that tasted horrendous and was do dry and tough she broke my razor blade and had to result to a chainsaw. We both wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to The Keg, and it won't be my last. The food was fantastic. The drinks were outstanding. The staff was amazing. 

The bar area and the restaurant area are sure to provide the dining environment that suits any person. The staff was amazing. 

I am glad I'll be in town for a few days. This gives me more evenings to dine at The Keg. Did I mention that the staff was amazing?"}
{"text":"Hm...so what can be said about The Keg that hasn't already been said? For me, going to The Keg has never really been for the food but doing something with friends that they enjoy. Man, do they enjoy The Keg. I've been to many Keg locations across the GTA, including the Keg mansion downtown and there was always something that made me feel: if it wasn't for the company, I would definitely have not considered going to The Keg. 

However! Last Friday night was money and time well spent. Usually I don't expect much, either because past experience were so-so or something or other. But, aside from hanging out with a friend I hadn't seen in a while, this location @ Sherway was my best Keg experience so far. The staff were friendly, attentive, and fast. The food, I felt was better prepared than most of the other Keg locations and for once my steak was done perfectly. We both had the NY sirloin and 1/2 lobster and the fully loaded baked potato was heaven.

Everything was great. But being as weird as I am, I think the thing I was most focused on was the lighting. I've been to places where the lighting will leave you wondering if they forgot to pay the bill or of a vampire would be dining on you instead. Fortunately, I did not feel this way here so you should be fine. Probably. Our server was kinda sparkley. Don't quote me on that."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to The Keg this evening after hearing some good Yelp reviews.  

My wife had the Prime Rib and I had the Top Sirloin.   Both steaks were cooked to perfection.  My medium rare was perfectly red throughout.  We have been to several Steakhouses over the years (Mastro's, Marco Polo Supper Club, Ruth Chris, etc) and honestly our food tonight was on par with restaurants 4 times the price.  We liked it all, the beer, the martini's, the meat, the delicious 3 cheese butter on the baked potato, the salad  and the creme bulee for dessert.  The only thing that was slightly lacking was the vegetable medley with the meal. 

I'm glad we chose this over Benihana next door. 

The wait staff was great and even told us about their free $23 birthday meal if you sign up for the birthday club online.  Sweet.  We will do this next year (today is my wifes birthday).

Good stuff."}
{"text":"We had a great experience here. The service was great. Prime rib was cooked to perfection. 
The bacon wrapped scallops were awesome. Thanks"}
{"text":"We had an excellent meal and experience at the Keg on 2/16/17. The food was prepared exactly to order and the atmosphere was festive and lively. Our waitress Lauren was on top of everything even with a full section. She was personable and took time to connect with us but not at the expense of other customers. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Santa Fe Chicken dip
Blue Cheese Filet w/fries

First, the Santa Fe Chicken dip is awesome. Sadly it's no longer available. :( Still, I had to put it on here because of how fantastic it was. I've had it many times and will definitely miss this appetizer.

The Blue Cheese Filet is outstanding! I usually get it medium, which they (usually) cook perfectly. The blue cheese is fluffy, rich and flavorful. It adds the right amount of complement as to not take away from the steak itself. Opt for the larger size (10 oz) -- even though it's not on the menu, they will make it that size for you. Fries are fries. Nothing special. I have also gotten their twice baked potato and like that as well.

Service is fantastic and consistent. I knocked off one star this time because my medium last time was half medium and half well done. Just wasn't right. I guess it happens every once in a while and it will not stop me from going back.

Also, the price is reasonable. For the steak plate with sides, it's ~$30. This is much better then being nickle and dimes for sides at other steak restaurants."}
{"text":"This is usually my favorite steak house for the money. Went for lunch today, big mistake. Ordered a simple beefdip with fries, my wife got a sirloin steak salad. We were the only ones seated in the lounge, took 35 mins to get our food while we listened to terrible music pounding way to lould. Fries were cold and beef dip dry however wifey enjoyed the salad. Very disappointed, then my wife gets mad at me for not leaving a TIP to which I had to remind her TIP stands for To Insure Prompt Service. Where's the Keg I'm used to??"}
{"text":"Oh My Gosh........My Boyfriend & I were in Phoenix for my birthday. We made our \"too do\" list and decide to checkout \"The Keg\". Not only was the atmosphere great the food was absolutely delicious! Our waiter was very friendly and ask if we were celebrating anything special and once he found out it was my birthday, he brought out a beautiful and wonderful large slice of cheesecake.

We really enjoyed ourselves and hope to go back again next year."}
{"text":"Good iteration of the popular steak house chain. Parking is a little on the light side so you may have to walk a bit. Food was done correctly and served hot and drinks were cold."}
{"text":"The keg is a good place to hang out after work! Happy hour is decent and it's never too crowded, which may be a good or bad thing. I've never had a bad experience but at the same time, it's never been anything special."}
{"text":"Had the filet. It was.. Well nothing to write home about. My friend said no mushrooms, but guess they didn't see the note. Our server was good. But the other staff who kept coming to the table and interrupting our conversation ... Drove me crazy!!  I mean really!!! The manager/ floor supervisor whatever it was, just too much. Trust your servers that they know how to do their job!!!  Once we paid then we really got to talk without getting the '\"is every thing good here??\" Every 5min!! I have been in the biz for a LONG time and if I had to deal with this kind of work place I would scream!!
 Food was ok. Server was good. The place Dark. It would be a great \"bar\" kinda place but not for dine in. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Why on earth would you leave the front doors open, when it is over hundred and ten outside, I love to sweat while I try to enjoy my meal"}
{"text":"My husband brought me and a few other business clients and their wives out for a nice dinner here.  We went on a Wednesday night, and my husband made it clear to the waiter from the beginning of the meal that we were out on business and that he intended on spending money on his clients.  Everyone ordered alcoholic beverages, and we ordered two appetizers right off the bat.  The waiter repeated our order to us incorrectly so we corrected him that we wanted the \"baked shrimp\" not the \"baked brie\".  When it came out it was a very small plate of melted cheese with one small roll (for 6 people).  My husband got the waiter's attention and asked about the app saying \"can you tell me what that is?\" and we got a very rude \"it's what you ordered\" response.  It was the baked shrimp that we had ordered, however you couldn't see the shrimp at all so we were confused.  Instead of explaining it we got a condescending and rude tone from the waiter the entire night.  I had the summer menu lobster roll, and my husband ordered the blue cheese steak.  My lobster roll consisted of mostly shrimp, with very little lobster and my husband's steak was cooked like rubber and had no flavor.  Throughout the night whenever we asked for anything (refill on a drink, silverware, etc.) the waiter acted as if we were bothering him.  This was a perfect opportunity for The Keg to make some good money and the waiter to make a good tip.  Unfortunately my husband takes clients out 1-2 nights a week and The Keg will not be a place that we take business back to.

The waiter's name for reference was Chris L.  Not impressed."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I treated our families to dinner here last night. We had a party of 11 and had 2 wonderful servers that were very friendly and helpful. The decor was very classy, service was great, the menu selection had a good variety, the food was prepared within reasonable timing and tasted great. Most of us ordered steaks that varied from medium rare to medium well and all of them were cooked correctly! 

If you order the crabcake appetizers, note they only come with 2 for $12.75 but they do taste really good. Main courses can range from $15-$35 depending on what you order. They have salads for about $10 and you can add a topping of steak, chicken or shrimp for $9.95. Steaks are about $20-$30 and come with sides. Desserts range from $3-$8 and have a nice selection that includes mini sizes incase you don't have room for a big dessert. 

I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone that wants a fancier dinner but not too formal. It's price is very fair for the quality and service you get!"}
{"text":"We ve  gone to the keg several times in the last few years. This time around, it was truly horrible. We ordered the filet mignon, prime , New York..etc. we ordered all medium, but half came out rare. The asparagus they could have grilled or added some seasoning. The calamari was fine..however it came with a lemon wedge that was brown. The wedge salad was fine, the Cesar salad was drenched. We decided as family never to return. I truly wish gilbert would open up a decent steakhouse."}
{"text":"Great steakhouse!   The steaks are tender and full of flavor.  Fortunately the noise level is low enough that you can easily hear yourself and your friend talk. The servers have always been very friendly and prompt.  Recommended."}
{"text":"I was very unimpressed by this restaurant. I've been to this location twice; both times, the service was slow and the food was unremarkable. This past Saturday, my family and I went for my grandmother's birthday. 
My water glass never got refilled, even after asking the waitress. My step mom had to ask three times for bread. The bread was finally brought to or table when we were almost finish with our meals even though she asked for it before she ordered an appetizer. The meal itself, was pretty bland. 
At the end of the meal, an employee, I assumed a manager, came to our table to ask how the meal was. My grandmother explained the service and the food and the manager apologized, but seemed unphased by it. He pretty much apologized and walked away. 
I'm sure this place only does well because of its convenient location. The food and service are both subpar."}
{"text":"Went to dinner, sat in the bar on the leather chairs, had bacon wrapped filet mignon and lobster with a wedge salad, and bacon wrapped scallops.  Patron silver.  Hello, great place, watched the dodger game all dinner, great music!"}
{"text":"Upon reading the reviews I thought I would give this place a try, I do have to say its a very beautiful restaurant & the service was excellent; however their food is not good. I did not like the flavor of the steak, I could grill up a better one at the house. Their cheesecake was just terrible didn't even taste like cheesecake. 2 stars for the service and decor. 0 stars for the food, I would never return."}
{"text":"Experienced a romantic dinner for two during AZ Restaurant Week. A burnt out light bulb above didn't keep us from enjoying our lovely evening. The lemon wedge on the Caesar salad added a more refreshing taste to a classic. My Oscar Chicken provided the right amount of creme sauce though a little dry, the rice pilaf made up for it. We ordered cheesecake and Miners pie that delivered a chocolate punch. Both desserts were smooth and more than enough to share. A wonderful place to enjoy  again!!"}
{"text":"Our server seemed off and not as sharp as you would expect in an upscale place. We asked for straws twice before that was taken care of. No bread was served until we had to ask for it. My husband's fries and coleslaw were missed and not served until he was nearly finished with his ribs. My Caesar salad had bitter lettuce that was brown around the edges. We ordered the key lime pie with raspberry drizzle but we got ours with that fake strawberry stuff which was overly sweet. They did make that right and brought the right pie & did not charge us for it. I think they do try but too many corners are being cut to save a buck. We will not return at these prices.

Disappointed in Scottsdale"}
{"text":"Stopped in for some appetizers last night. Had the Prime Rib sliders and Mushrooms Neptune. Both dishes were well prepared and tasted good. Our server/bartender Jay was attentive and described the daily specials. Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Was an awesome place!!!  I just wish they had one where I live.  Us New Yorker's can eat some steak.  Seafood was even very fresh tasting!  Keep up the good work!!  You guys greatly improved my trip to Phoenix after it started off quite awful at another restaurant.  Excellent food and drinks.  If I'm ever back this way I will definitely be stopping in!!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been to The Keg several times and have loved it every time. The food is excellent and the ambiance is nice while still being kid friendly. Our steaks were cooked perfectly and my daughter loves the burgers. Really love going here as a nice date night and highly recommend it."}
{"text":"We were there to celebrate a birthday. The restaurant seated a party if 8 drunk people next to us. They were so loud that we couldn't even talk at our table.

Not only did the incompetent management NOT quiet them down but the waiter kept on over serving them. Stupid and possibly a violation of the rules governing their liquor license. Here's hoping no one gets killed if they drive home. 

This place is expensive. The food's ok but I will never return to this location. Total incompetence. 

Take my advice. Go somewhere else for an expensive steak.


PS The Keg's response is pathetic too. They obviously failed to read my review properly or they wouldn't be asking questions like which Keg location. I am totally done with you."}
{"text":"(Inside) ambiance was very nice for a large restaurant.  I had the blue cheese crusted, bacon wrapped filet mignon.  Ordered it medium and it was cooked perfectly.  Very, very tasty steak.  Also had the twice baked potato and that was very well done as well.  It was all what I expected for the price that your paying.  Very good meat."}
{"text":"Great food and great service.  I wanted a drink that was not on the bartenders menu and Brysen made it for me. Great service all around."}
{"text":"I ask for a soda water with a lemon and got  it with a lime. Ask to have my steak medium and it was under cooked...medium rare. I expected better service and better food for the money. They recooked my sirloin....didn't give me a new one. I ordered sirloin oscar so the bernaise  sauce was not replace thus the dish was ruined. I will not be back and wish I would have gone to Longhorn Steakhouse."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience. Perfect steak and good sized portions. Great service. Really enjoyed the calamari and shrimp appetizer. Cheesecake and carrot cake very moist and wedge salad super fresh. Came out from California for meeting and well worth the trip."}
{"text":"I've been to The Keg before at a different location...love the atmosphere and the vibe at this location especially.  Very quiet and cozy on a Monday night...need to try more dishes on the menu - will be back!"}
{"text":"We had a great Thanksgiving at The Keg!  Since most of our family was out of town, we decided to keep it simple and go out to eat.  After receiving an email about their Thanksgiving dinner, we decided it was the perfect place since my dad doesn't like turkey and really wanted a steak.  We all got what we wanted and had a great time!"}
{"text":"We went to The Keg last night to celebrate my birthday (and, no, I'm not saying which one!) and our friends' 40th wedding anniversary.  We wanted steak and quiet.  

We got the steak!  It was outstanding.  But my friend had the stuffed chicken and I thought it was even better than my steak!  

Besides the opportunity to celebrate with our friends, our server Justin was a high point for the evening.  He balanced being attentive and friendly with giving us our space.  Great job, Justin!

We had a reservation and we were seated immediately upon arrival -- even on a busy Saturday evening.  Service, busing, food delivery, dessert, coffee -- everything just clicked all evening.

The only negatives...my favorite appetizer is no longer on the menu :(  And it was very loud.  At first the music was really loud and the patrons were even louder to be heard over the music.  As it cleared out though, the noise level abated and we had a much easier time talking.  

Thanks, Justin; you and The Keg made it a great celebration for all of us!"}
{"text":"Went there a few weeks back and ordered the rib steak...it was delish, as well as the twice baked potato! We didn't get dessert but will next time!  Look forward to trying other things on the menu! May sit at the bar next time I go to see if the bartender has any skills!"}
{"text":"4 star for the food, 2 star for the atmosphere.

So I had to come back here to spend the $25 gift card I got from the end of last year, and still enjoyed everything like the other times. 

It wasn't that busy when we arrived at 6:35pm on a Friday, and we were seated in less than 5 minutes. I felt I had to order the Chocolate Martini just for my own curiosity since i haven't tried it, so I did, it was pretty good! Definitely got the sweet chocolate taste and looked pretty neat with the little chocolate pieces on top of the ice.

 I ordered my usual, Filet cooked in medium  rare with twice baked potato, tender and juicy as always. The twice baked potato, on the other hand, was really salty this time, it usually tends to be salty, but this time was a bit over. 

This time we were seated by the hallway next to the bar, VERY LOUD!!! I was kinda annoyed by the noises so if you wanna enjoy your dinner in a little quieter atmosphere, get away from the bar area!!"}
{"text":"We dined at The Keg last night. I had the blue cheese encrusted steak. It was delicious.  My husband the pepper steak. Another excellent choice. The place was busy but service was excellent."}
{"text":"We had only dined at one other location for this restaurant, in Chandler, so this was our first time at the Desert Ridge location.  We had a FANTASTIC server, named Mikaela(sp?) and although we had a very small issue with cold mashed potatoes, the manager, Danny, came over and not only took off the entire meal in question, but gave us free dessert! He wanted to give all 4 of us freebies, but we were so full from a fantastic meal, we only accepted 2 desserts to share.  Every single person we encountered at this location, from the hostess, to our server, to even the \"bus boys\" and of course, the Manager, we super friendly and just spot on!  Nice to have finally had a restaurant with FANTASTIC customer service in Arizona!  Kudos to this entire staff!  We will DEFINITELY be back!"}
{"text":"All I can say is that the salad was good and the one bite of my filet was delicious but the ROACH that appeared in the middle of our table ruined everything. We left without finishing the meal. I can get over a hair(sometimes) or piece of plastic but roaches are another thing."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the baseball sirloin steak here ($27). Seasoned well, cooked properly, and good portion sizes, keep me coming back for it again and again. I wish that there were more choices for sides, like vrious green vegetables. The service is great and I would recommend the keg to anyone."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited The Keg for the first time last Friday night for a much needed, baby-free date night. We danced around where to go, and ultimately decided here as something \"new\". I had always heard good things about it, so I was excited to give it a try...and I could not be happier we made that choice!

Service: 
I will start here since this is the #1 thing that matters to me in most places, and I was SO happy with it. Our server (Debbie) was polite, pleasant, friendly, and knowledgeable about the menu. And she was fast. We literally never had to ask for anything. On a Friday night...that's a HUGE bonus! Thank you Debbie!

Drinks:
Sadly no cocktails this visit--prego momma and dad was kind enough not to rub it in, so nothing to report here.

Starters:
We only tried 1 app since it was just the two of us, and we opted for the calamari. Lightly breaded/fried which was nice, and a surprise accompaniment by some red peppers and jalapeños. While the chili-ginger dipping sauce was good, it's not something i generally think of to pair with calamari, so I didn't use it but for one taste. Instead, I substituted the greek feta sauce (odd dipping choice for calamari don't you think?) for a garlic aioli and then added tabasco--YUM!

**Just note when order apps: they also serve warm bread...i think it was a sourdough. Amazing! Could have eaten the whole thing :)

Dinner: 
Call us boring, or call us smart (i'd like to think the latter) but my husband and I ordered the exact same thing. From their summer lobster menu we got the Steak and 1/2 Lobster. Not 1/2 lobster TAIL...an entire 1/2 of a lobster! It was really decently priced, and that lobster was actually fresh, not frozen, unlike the tails serve off of their regular menu. The 6 and 8 oz steaks were decent sized and truly cooked to perfection; although they did mix up our steaks on who got what size--they were cooked appropriately and my husband sacrificed some extra meat for our growing kid haha. 

The lobster was UN-REAL! So sweet, very easy to remove surprisingly, and despite eating my steak first, was still really warm when it was time to eat. 
We both got the veggie medley as our accompaniment, and while a good selection of veggies, they were a little undercooked for my liking. Just barely not raw. But, with a little of the butter sauce from the lobster it was manageable :)

The only downside I would say is the parking. The parking available immediately next to the restaurant is always full. And while the rest of the \"mall\" parking isn't too far from the location, on a hot summer night when you're pregnant...not a huge fan haha."}
{"text":"Best steak in the metro area and that includes Ruth's Chris and Arrowhead Grill!! Good value for the price and even got a sweet little Happy Anniversary card from the staff."}
{"text":"Pretty sweet steak, I have tried them all, and you don't need steak sauce.  My favorite place and visit frequently when I have time. Steak, twice baked potato.. cant go wrong."}
{"text":"first time here. Came with the wifey and the  kiddos for my anniversary . got the filet mignon with tiger shrimp one word : supreme!!!!! we love  it love love it we'll be back (without the kids next time lol ). service was prompt and fast  server Adrian was very attentive and always checking on us  ."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed. I ordered a 20oz Rib eye that was flavor less.  They had to bring steak sauce.....but as we know...a good steak doesn't need steak sauce!! The one positive thing is the service.  Ryan L made our experience worthwhile.  He was super nice and understood my frustration over a horrible meal. Keep smiling Ryan L"}
{"text":"I was very impressed by the service at this restaurant. They were very attentive and aware of our needs. Our year-old son joined us and was treated as if he had as much right to be there as we did. They even brought his a complementary child's plate to eat while we waited for our food.

Although pricey, the food was incredible. The bread was divine, steak cooked to order, and desserts absolutely yummy."}
{"text":"Solid restaurant.  Prime rib was very good. Staff was attentive.

Had lunch and dinner on consecutive days and I ordered the burger for lunch and they forgot to describe that in Ontario you can't pick meat temp on ground beef, needless to say it was over promised and under delivered,

Wine menu big screwup. They advertise their wine as a duck horn cab and not decoy which is a lower end brand of. Duckhorn.... Potential Lawsuit in the making"}
{"text":"So very delicious!  I had the cod, rice, asparagus and such a wonderful combination.  Hubby had Brussels sprouts with his dish and they were awesomely made with bacon.  I'm picky because i cook with a lot of spices, so I know flavor and so does The Keg.  Very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"We chose to eat here as the restaurant looks great from the outside, but ended up having a terrible experience. We ordered two entree's with salads and appetizers, and the waitress seemed nice at first when she took our order. However, that was the last we saw of her for a majority of the night. Finally after waiting MORE than 45mins, I walked inside to see what the hold up was as we had not even received our salads. The waitress explained to us that our order ticket had disappeared, but that it was not her fault. She then had us wait for another 15 minutes, and finally brought out one of the salads. The other salad came out finally at the same time as our steaks and crab legs, and all of the food was cold to the touch. Bottom line, terrible service and almost zero effort made to rectify the mistakes that were made. We ended paying for everything, even the French fries that never made it to the table. The bartender just laughed when I mentioned the whole experience to him, and he informed me that other than sitting at the bar there was not a reason to come to the restaurant. I will never go here again, and will advise others to avoid. I felt disgusted with the entire establishment top to bottom."}
{"text":"Been to several locations in the Phoenix area as well as in Canada. If there is a Keg near by, always search them out."}
{"text":"I signed up for the Keg Birthday Club, they give you a free sirloin dinner! The server was prompt, knowledgeable, and courteous. The ambiance is very nice. The bread is delicious! Having that said, the steak is the only thing I didn't finish... I couldn't bring myself to say anything because it was free, but it was overcooked, sort of dry-chewy with too much charred goodness on the outside that overwhelmed the flavor. The veggies, shrimps, scallops, pilaf, salad, and everything else we had was delicious, but the keg is a steakhouse so......
 At any rate it was a free meal so I can't really complain but the promotion did not serve its purpose because I wasn't impressed enough to get a good impression overall.
  I just changed it from 2 star to three star because I just remembered the hostess was pretty damn F-I-N-E, even my girlfriend thought so.  =)"}
{"text":"I ordered Black Cod plate,$32... It was taste horrible, fishy smell. It is not fresh fish: (
My husband loves steak,  so he ordered steak,  medium rare.  It came out nice too but too cooked..He could't finish 1/2 of it: (
I ordered tuna taco,  they gave us old lime so when we ate the taco,  it tasted bitter: (
The bill was over $200 plus good tips... Tried to have nice family dinner but not happened.  My husband didn't complain but for sure he never come back."}
{"text":"It's a nice place for a good dinner.  I had the Teriyaki Sirloin and enjoyed it.  The flavor was very good along with the fresh vegetables.  The dinner salad was huge and the bread warm delicious. Our waiter was Jeff and very personable and happy to serve and tell us about his relocation to the Scottsdale area.  We sat at a table near the kitchen which can always be good or bad.  Happy to see it looked clean and the cooks were doing cooking and not screwing around.  We will go back."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of The Keg, especially this location. 
I always get fantastic service and perfectly cooked food here. 
This location is also beautiful with its design. 
Always busy, make reservations."}
{"text":"I came to the keg with a group of friends. I've never had a bad meal here but tonight was not great. Three of them got steak and loved it but I got salmon and it was awful! Super dry and over cooked. Also the bell peppers were fermented. The manager came out and apologized and removed the meal from our tab. The manager was very professional and nice. Other than those two things everyone seemed to enjoy their meal. I would recommend this restaurant to a friend but tell them to stick with a steak."}
{"text":"While Nikolas was an excellent server, rating the overall experience as average... The bread used to be so wonderful - now it is  like the bread is delivered frozen and then microwaved - at least it tasted that way... 

The salad was very \"vinegary\" and the filet was ... \"eh\". Even the Lobster was less than desirable...

Not the keg we remember :-( Carrabba's Italian Grill is ALWAYS reliable and delicious... we may never be back!"}
{"text":"I don't get it. The food is very average. The garlic toast is greasy and kid food. The bacon wrapped scallops are laughable in size, presentation and taste. The steaks are grocery store quality. What's the big deal about a twice baked potato? Nothing special. Nothing at all. Oh, and they cooked my medium rare steak to medium well. It's a glorified Sizzler without the salad bar which I would have welcomed over the wedge salad which was served only with bacon bits and not great, SIsco food service blue cheese dressing. Yuk. It ain't cheap either."}
{"text":"The Keg is a great special occasion restaurant. I wanted a quiet and romantic birthday dinner, the hubby wanted a big steak. The Keg was delivered on both counts. I had the black cod which was like butter and cooked perfectly. Hubby had a beautiful medium rare prime rib. Everything else on our plates was good but the meat was the absolute star. The server made a point of asking if we were celebrating anything and surprised me with the Billie Miner pie when I asked to look at the desert menu. It was a perfect way to finish off a fanatic meal. The whole experience was wonderful and I had a very happy birthday."}
{"text":"We celebrated a special occasion here. We sat on the patio -- weather was pleasant. Katy waited on us and took super good care of us! Turns out that she had waited on us a year ago for the same special occasion. Justin treated us specially with a Champagne split! The food was excellent -- tasty, well-prepared, hot, and well-served. We had the Santa Fe Chicken Dip for an appetizer, the Peppercorn New York and the Dungeness Manhattan entrees, a nice bottle of Molly Dooker Two Left Feet wine, and the outrageous Billy Miner Pie for dessert. Took leftovers home. This place is a class act -- we plan to return frequently!"}
{"text":"The KEG has never disappointed.  I frequently go there for special occasions.  There steak and fries are so delicious!  And for dessert, their cheesecake is the best I have ever eaten.  It easily makes the Cheesecake Factory's cheesecake taste terrible.  Like heaven in a bite.  Their servers are always nice and the manager makes sure to come buy and see if everyone is doing good.  That is one thing that is special to the KEG that I love."}
{"text":"I've never actually been here for an actual meal but I've been here a few times for business happy hours.  The sliders, bacon wrapped scallops and calamari are all awesome.  They have a decent beer selection too."}
{"text":"After several visits for varying events, including appetizers, happy hour, or a date this is a great place.

Cost efficient for the ambiance, service and food quality.  Not anywhere near what you would pay at some other steakhouses and just as good.

The escargot, steak, lobster and sides are all enjoyable.  The french onion soup is sweeter than I prefer but that is preference and it is a good bowl of soup.

The service has always been remarkable at this location.  The fact that it has a large patio and the bar side of the restaurant is extremely spacious makes this my favorite of The Keg locations."}
{"text":"The food and service at this restaurant were both top notch. Our meals were delicious and our waitress, Sarah, was great."}
{"text":"So-so overall experience. Don't think we'll be back. Have to admit however, the steak was amazingly tender from what I expected from a chain like this but worse Béarnaise sauce and Moscow Mule in history... Way too expensive for their offer."}
{"text":"I have a feeling that if I had ordered a steak instead of tuna, I would be giving the Keg a higher rating.  My colleagues both had the prime rib which looked okay.  However, the tuna I ordered was way overcooked and tasted like it had been frozen for two decades prior to cooking.  I'm bumping the rating up to 3 stars because the service was great and we had an enjoyable evening at the bar."}
{"text":"This place rocks the steaks are always perfect and the Neptune mushrooms are to die for"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner because my husband's friend lives in the area and the location was convenient for all of us. 

It's not exactly a \"hip\" place, it's for a more older crowd. We were one of the youngest tables there. The crowd were more in their mid 50s to 60s. The atmosphere is not there. 

We were seated in the corner and the spotlight above us was out. So we were relying on the 2 tea candles to see our menu and food. The light that was stuck by the corner didn't help either. The Mr took out his blackberry for light to see the menu.

For it to be called \"The Keg\" we were really disappointed in the beer selection. We were expecting more variety of beers, and they didn't even have Heifenweiser. The Mr ordered a Blue Moon.

Between the 5 of us, 2 ordered the sirloin,  top sirloin, prime ribs and chicken. When our food arrived, it was lukewarm. The Mr and I had the same order. I ordered my steak medium well but it was well done. Everything was very flavorful, but when it started getting cold the food became really salty. The bread that comes in the beginning, isn't all that great. It's just regular bread.

Our service was mediocore. He wasn't very attentive to our needs, such as refilling our water, beer, or pepsi. It was a busy night, but he hardly ever checked up on us. By the time he returned with a pitcher of water asking if we wanted a refill, we were getting ready to leave."}
{"text":"The food and ambience was amazing as always. I wanted to go out of my way to mention that our server Jeff made our experience that much better. His attention to detail was top notch. In a day and age were customer service is nonexistent he reminded us that there are still professionals out there. We can't wait to come back again. Thank you for another perfect evening."}
{"text":"I ate here tonight with my wife and the food was average at best.  We had a couple of appetizers which were okay, the crab cakes were delicious, but the scallops wrapped in bacon were so small the bacon overwhelmed the dish.  The steak for me was the biggest disappointment.  I got the rib steak, ordered it rare, it came medium rare, but as we had a movie to get to afterwards I let it slide.  The quality of the steak was not good at all, it was tough and not seasoned well.  If I had paid $15 for it I would not complain, but when you pay $35 for a steak, you expect it to be decent, and as I said it was less than average.   My wife's steak was dry but cooked perfectly. The service was great, but honestly the overall experience was the quality you expect from a place like Applebee's, you just pay a lot more for it."}
{"text":"First time at The Keg last night. Excellent atmosphere, fantastic service, and inredibly delicious food. My fiance and I decided it would be a good place for his birthday dinner and we were both so glad we went. Its a little pricey, but a great place for special occasion dinners. Our waiter was amazing, attentive but not overbearing. Our food was delightful. The salad was cold amd crisp. The steaks were cooked and seasoned perfectly. I would also recommend the twice baked potatoes. (Wish I could recreate those at home) and since it was his birthday they brought him the most delicious dessert. 
Definitely worth the money. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"SUCH GREAT FOOD! I have been there twice and have loved it both times. They are a pretty high end restaurant. The prices definitely reflect that. My boyfriend and I each got house salads for an app, filet mignons and mashed potatoes that came out to around a $80 bill. We absolutely love their food. Very professional and kind servers."}
{"text":"Arrived for an early dinner at 5:30 on a Saturday. My husband and I both Ordered the top sirloin and both were over cooked. Sent them back , waited forever, second round was better in regards to temp however the meat was so tough my husband declined his (I ate mine I was so hungry and didn't want to wait) and ended up ordering a chicken breast. We didn't get to eat our meals together everything took so long. Minor redemption was the salads were great and the vegetable side was nice. Our waitress was pleasant but after 2 returned steaks we found it odd that a manager never even bothered to come to our table to talk to us. I haven't been to the keg in years as the previous experience was less than memorable. I can guarantee we won't be back. We get better quality steaks at Texas Roadhouse!"}
{"text":"Love the Keg. Consistently good service, food, and atmosphere. Regardless of being in the bar or patio. Even the Keg in Vancouver, and other cities rock. Favorite appetizer is the Mushroom Neptune. Try the Orange Slice Martini, or the cinnamon girl."}
{"text":"Excellent food here.  Stayed near the airport and ate at the Keg.  Good steak.  Had the escargo appetizer and the scallops appetizer.  Both are excellent.  Ordered a ribeye and enjoyed it.  Our waitress was hilarious too...ask for Joanne.  Overall a great place.  I haven't eaten here in the US and didn't even know they were a chain when we ate her."}
{"text":"I like to see the Keg in uptown .they make the best steak"}
{"text":"Cinco de mayo, no mexican restaurant had any seating available, we decided to try the Keg, place where we go sometimes to enjoy a Jameson or two... Smiling hostesses, fun and energetic server, his lack of experience was invisible but admitted; his smile and great sense of hospitality, combined by a charismatic personnality and willingness to please were highly appreciated. Tuna tartare appetizer is almost too big, with very good tuna and plenty of avocado. Both steak were good and cooked to perfection. Overall a great experience, and we might come back more often in the dining room instead of just the bar. At $68 a MontRedon Chateauneuf du Pape, a pleasant server, nicely cooked steaks in a nice atmosphere less than 10 minutes from home, good deal!"}
{"text":"I went to The Keg for the very first time, last night, not really knowing what to expect.  

I arrived with five in my party and since we were there for a relatively early dinner (5:30ish), we only had to wait a few minutes before we were seated.  

The restaurant has a nice ambiance which, depending on your company, can either be romantic or relaxing.

Three of us started our meal off with cocktails.  One person ordered a draft (which came in a large pilsner), another ordered a classic gin martini, and I was in the mood for something sweet and fruity, so the waitress recommended the \"Mango Time.\"  

While the draft beer are served in huge glasses, the martinis are served in standard size, and the frozen drinks are, I think, a little on the small side, relative to price of what you would pay at other restaurants.  

I was a little surprised at my drink when it arrived, 'cause it was just plain.  No sugar rim, no garnish of any kind - not even a little sprig of mint.  I guess it's not a big deal, but with the way the restaurant tries to present itself, I expected more.

Speaking of expecting more: I expected more TASTE from my cocktail.  Maybe it's just me, 'cause the waitress raved about this drink, but, frankly, it wasn't good.  When I had my first sip, I didn't taste anything until the very end when I detected a faint hint of over-ripe mango.  To the restaurant's credit, though, the waitress was pleasant about it and substituted my drink for a strawberry daiquiri which was pretty good - sugar rim, no whipped cream or strawberry garnish, though. *pout*

We decided to skip appetizers (we ordered bread baskets early and filled up - they were like soft, warm, french-bread bagels - YUM)!

Before our entrees were served, two of us received salads.  One guy ordered a Caesar salad and I subbed out my Caesar for a house salad with ranch on the side.  The house salad consisted of spring mix with a few thinly sliced cucumber half moons, about four cherry tomatoes that were halved, and a few strips of red and yellow bell peppers.  It wasn't great.  I can't vouch for the Caesar salad, but the dude told me that it was \"too spicy.\"  He wasn't referencing hotness, but said that there was too much garlic.

Our entrees arrived and looked palatable, but not as appetizing as I would expect a $25.00 entree to look.  I ordered a prime rib, because the waitress said they were \"known for our prime rib,\" so I had to check it out, as did two others in my party.  The remaining two ordered the sirloin special.

I ordered an end-cut, because I enjoy my prime rib medium, leaner, and in my experience, end-cuts seem to have more seasoning.  The waitress said I didn't really have to worry about that, because their prime rib was really lean, anyway.  Well, the huge chunks of fat and gristle on my plate beg to differ.  Yuck.

My entree was also accompanied by a baked potato, mixed vegetables, and mushrooms.  The baked potato was so overcooked that the outside was inedible and the inside was so dehydrated that it looked like my potato was empty.  I nearly asked my waitress for a flashlight to go hunting for my potato, until I saw what appeared to be chives peeking through the cave of what once was a happy Idaho spud.

Now, the mixed veggies.  Oh, the mixed veggies.  *sigh*  

I take some responsibility for this.  I should have asked what exactly \"mixed vegetables\" consisted of.  It was my fault to ASSume that it would be either your typical California blend or something similar.  The mixed vegetables consisted of bell pepper slices with bits of red onion and snap peas.  I can't really tell how they were cooked because they were kinda mushy, yet some were crunchy.  They were oily, but not oily enough to have been exclusively cooked in oil.  In any event, they were gross.  Also, the mushrooms that came with my meal weren't anything spectacular: boiled button mushrooms.  Big whoop.

At the end, I brought home over half my meal (though the waitress didn't pack up my baked potato), as did my mother, so my father had a bonanza when we got home (he had other plans so didn't get to go out with us, lucky him).

After reading all of the stellar reviews, and having already visited this place, I'm not really sure why this place is getting raved about.  The food is okay, not great.  They did a good job of cooking the meat to order, particularly our prime rib orders, but the seasoning is a little blah (it leaves a weird aftertaste that I can't quite put my finger on... maybe I don't want to...), the baked potato and veggies were subpar (one of the guests said his twice-baked potato was pretty good, as did another say the mashed potatoes weren't terrible), and the mushrooms were bland.

It must be the ambiance and atmosphere that sells this place, because you could get the same meal at Outback for half the price and the food is relatively comparable, with Outback having better salads and mushrooms and The Keg having better bread."}
{"text":"Went because I got a free dinner as part of their birthday club. New York strip was cooked perfectly medium and had great flavor. The garlic mashed were good and my family especially liked the free sourdough bread 

Good experience and great service. Will definitely be back the next time we are in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This restaurant is fantastic not to mention the food is delicious!  I love eating at The Keg Steakhouse.  The servce is superior and the food is awesome.  This restaurant really knows how to grill a great steak.  It can be quite noisy but this place is usually packed so makes sense.  Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"What in the world happened to this place??   I moved here a couple years ago and when I first went to The Keg I loved it...it was wonderful.  We would go there for special occasions and pay a lot for a nice meal.  Over the last 4 times we have been there we have noticed the quality of the food getting worse and worse.  Two times ago I said I would never go there again....however, on another special occasion we decided to give it another chance.  I ordered a prime rib and it came out overcooked and extremely rough.  It was not able to finish the steak.  Everybody in our group was not happy with the food.  This time, I will not go back to The Keg again due to the quality of food.  They charge a premium for a meal that is really not very good anymore.  Last visit I threw down $300 for the meal.   Owners of The Keg:  I would highly recommend you listen to what other people are saying here on Yelp and get your act together."}
{"text":"Everything about it was good! I went on a Saturday night with my family around 8pm, they told us that the wait time was approx 20-30 mins which I was expecting... But, we only waited about 5 mins and we were seated! 

The service wasn't very fast, but it was a full house and there were a couple large groups with over 10 people... Even though they were super busy, the service was excellent! The waiter took time to help and clearly answer any questions we had.

Food was soooo goood! Just perfect steak and sides! Twice baked potato is my favourite side. Ohh and unlimited bread which sooo good and warm with whipped butter! 

Pricesfor entree ranges from approx $20-$40. I can't afford to go there often, but def worth saving up for a special event"}
{"text":"Came here with my friends for a girls night. The four of us ordered medium rare steaks - but we all received steaks that ranged from blue to very well done. After telling the staff about our concern with the steak, they happily made each of us a new one and took the steak off of our bill. Service was great - they saw unhappy customers and they rectified the issue right away with no question. Additionally, they added a little dessert at the end! Chef came out and also offered his apologizes."}
{"text":"Oh nooooo one of the most delicious \"free\" items on the menu has been updated or rather downgraded...the table bread. Once a nice squarish loaf of artisan bread, crusty on the exterior and warm, light and airy inside has now been transformed into a larger loaf of unappetizing dinner roll in disguise. Oh please Keg don't downgrade this experience for us for the sake of cost! Now I'm starting off my meal already disappointed :("}
{"text":"This is an awesome place for a terrific steak with great service in the East Valley.  While it will cost a little more than the Outback or some other place that hands you a bucket of peanuts to start, you get what you pay for - ambiance, great service and a perfect steak.  My wife has been cutting back on her red meat intake, and she absolutely loves the Thai Chicken.  I love their prime rib, and their sirloins are truly amazing.  

They have a great patio area that fills up quickly and you can order from the full menu in the bar, so when we are feeling a little more casual, we'll belly up to the bar and still enjoy great food and catch a game on TV.

While I don't believe they have a dress code, I don't feel out of place dressing up or going casual."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to the keg in a few years.
Was very disappointed with food. I had a shrimp cocktail to start with. The shrimp were tasteless no flavor almost like it was Imitation Shrimp! I also ordered for the table garlic butter shrimp this was a little better, but not much!
Bread that was brought out to table and was not that good at all either it was crumbling apart while trying to put butter on it.
The staff was really nice, but took forever to get our dinners out. They said there was big party before us, so who knows! Overall was not what i remembered about this place. My friends had Ribeye steaks and Enjoyed  there Steaks. In the end manager came out and apologised."}
{"text":"I don't usually review chain restaurants.  I figure they can do without extra promotion, and I generally don't care for the food at chains, but The Keg surprised me.  

Everything I had was very good, from the Cosmo to start off the meal to the house salad that actually had fresh mixed greens and on to the moist rosemary-seasoned pork chop with delicious mashed potatoes.  The server was very attentive and willing to make change for a hundred-dollar bill, as well as split up the check to accommodate two couples.  As soon as we told him we needed to get going to a concert, the check was on our table.  A manager came by to see how things were, which was a nice touch."}
{"text":"We hadn't been to The Keg in years.  What a disappointment!  You expect a Steakhouse to know how to cook as steak as ordered but not even close. You should also expect the steak to be chewable not as tough as leather.  What a waste of time and money.  Terrible!"}
{"text":"Great steak and sides, big fan. pricey, good for special occasions. Service has always been good"}
{"text":"Best food. Best service. Our waiter was Eric, andhe was great! all our food was top notch! it was my first time at one and ill definetly go back!"}
{"text":"This was the our first visit to the Tempe location and it was not as nice as our other visits to other locations within the valley. There was an issues with a salad coming out rotten in the middle, we didn't need the manager to \"stop by\" the table but rather the waiter could have simply removed the charge from our bill since it was barely eaten instead of charging us for the rotten salad. Also, our waiter took more interest in other tables around us and we had to stop him several times to get drinks refilled that were empty and to get items brought to the table because he was not checking on us. It was supposed to be a special evening since we had a birthday in the group and I wished we had chosen a different restaurant to celebrate at."}
{"text":"My husband and his twin brother were celebrating their 75th Birthday as I told the reservationist and the front desk when we arrived @ 5:00 Saturday 3/7/2015-- NOTHING was done for them even though they promised they would.  The food -  prime rib - was not warm, the lettuce wedge was made with wilting lettuce, and the asparagus was khaki green. Huge disappointment and ended any return visit."}
{"text":"I am giving it 3 stars as the food was just okay.  There was no fabulous tastes from the prime rib dinners that me or my daughter who has a bit of a culinary background (homeade cooking that is).  The reason for an actual 3-stars, is that it is a beautiful restaurant, very comfortable dining, services are wonderful, but the food just did not satisfy paying just over $100.00.  Sorry, I have had much more flavorful prime rib at Black Angus.  Save your money folks, maybe we will have to venture over to Flemings, Ruth Chris or another steakhouse for a delicious and flavorful prime rib dinner."}
{"text":"I am no longer vegan due to the keg's steaks!! ... and ill never look back! I love this place and staff so much!!! :)"}
{"text":"Being Canadian, you should've seen the smile on my face when I saw a Keg in Gilbert of all places! Classic menu, just like the one back home. Glad I found you!"}
{"text":"My husband brought me here for my birthday dinner and the food here was amazing.  My husband had the Manhatten strip steak with twice baked potatoe and he enjoyed it. I had the oven baked salmon with rice...all I can say is DELICIOUS!! It was a little pricey but worth every penny,  the service was great.  All around a great experience. We'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Our server was perfect. Helpful, talkative, witty and didn't smother us at all. Thanks Kyle. Made our night!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible.  The bread was stale.  The filet mignon was overcooked and not remotely tender.  The creme brule was basically jello.  I have had better fast food, and that costs 10% as much as I payed."}
{"text":"The Keg is a very upscale restaurant that definitely exemplifies fine dining.  The wait staff is very attentive and the menu has a lot of appealing dishes on it.  I ordered the 12 oz prime rib with the twice baked potato, at the waiter's recommendation.  The prime rib probably wasn't my best match since it was a little too fatty for my liking and had a very natural flavor to it, while I think I would have preferred something a little more seasoned.  The fried onions on top were delicious though and gave it a nice complement.  Also I probably could have gone with the 10 oz, it was a lot of food!  The twice baked potato was amaaaaazing, at least in the few bites I could manage to sneak in while working on the meat.  The baseball steak and dungeness crab cluster also tasted delicious (someone else at my table ordered that).  The baseball steak had great flavoring on it, and was what made me realize that mine was a little bland for my liking.

Really great food overall, and definitely a great \"special occasion\" restaurant to go to."}
{"text":"We came for a business meeting and everyone in our party enjoyed their food. Most ordered a variety of steaks and they were all cooked as requested. The food was good from the apps to the dessert. My only complaint would be that the waiter didn't seem to understand his position. Most waiters at a restaurant of this type use proper English and are professional. This guy talked like he was an aspiring rapper doing this gig until a record label picked him up. Not the end of the world but not professional either."}
{"text":"The best filet mignon I've had in my life, and I don't even like meat. The stuffed mushrooms were amazing, I've never tasted anything like it. Pricey, but worth the money, service, and ambiance."}
{"text":"So tonight we went to The Keg in Chandler for a nice steak dinner. Yes, we brought a 4 year old, a 2 year old, and a 1 year old. I have to say I was beyond impressed with The Keg. They had crayons and paper for the kids. The kids had their own fancy leather bound kids menu like the grown ups. They immediately brought out water with straws and lids and then juice. They also brought out a kids starter plate with crackers, veggies and fruit (while adults figured out what to eat). They offered to bring out the kids orders early. And while we were waiting to pay they brought very small bowls of ice cream. Going out to eat with young children  always causes some anxiety (especially a nice place where people aren't necessarily expecting kids), but The Keg really went above and beyond to make my kids feel welcome and genuinely part of the dining experience."}
{"text":"Wife took me here for my birthday dinner.  Had the Prime Rib Classic, and she had the sirloin classic.  Mine was melt in my mouth tender, and so flavorful.  The au jus was more like a terrific steak sauce.  It was thick with the spices that were rubbed on the Prime Rib, and wonderfully zesty.

My wife's sirloin came out a bit overdone, but she ate most of it anyway.  When the server asked how dinner was, I mentioned the dryness of my wife's steak.  Even though she had eaten almost two-thirds of it, the server offered to replace it.  She was happy with what she had eaten just that it was on the well side of medium.

Manager came by and made the same offer.  We weren't looking for a handout.  Just was providing constructive feedback.  I then saw the manager go back into the kitchen.  She had told us she would mention something to the Kitchen Manager. So I assume that was what she was doing.

When the brought the bill, the comped our dessert and drinks.  Didn't expect that.  They really wanted to make sure we were satisfied. Well, I was so satisfied, I decided to get a yelp account and tell all you about it.

Kudos to the Keg on Williams Field Rd.  I highly recommend it, and they will be continuing to get my service.  As long as Sherry is still the front end manager."}
{"text":"Good service, good ambience.  Mediocre food for the price.  Dinner for 2 was $120 with tip and no alcohol.
Had the ribs that weren't anything to write home about.
Probably won't return, at least until my memory fades."}
{"text":"The service is always so consistent when coming here. It's  a great social environment for friends to hang out. Food is always so well plated and delicious!!  staff are so helpful if you are unsure of what to get.

Heads up..the menu recently changed!!! No more chimney churry sauce!!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been to a Keg Steakhouse (different location) so I knew it would be good.  I was wrong.
The prime rib was not good - chewy and overly fatty. I knew I should have gone with the steak!  Lesson learned.
The service - saved it for us.  William R was great!  We didn't bother him with our food quality issues but continued on with our meal - never felt rushed, he kept drinks filled and was always checking in.  Because of him, I will be willing to give the Keg another try in the future... won't have the prime rib though."}
{"text":"I made reservations for a group of 21 based on the Yelp reviews.  The service and follow up was great, we changed the time and the number of people a few times but Kelly always handled it very well.  We ordered off the full menu, had many appetizers to start, full dinners, desserts and drinks.  The service was great and so was the food - everyone seemed very pleased with the selection (some vegetarians) and timing of the meals - sometimes in a large group the food doesn't come out together but this wasn't an issue.  It is always hard to plan a dinner in a city you are not familiar with, but I would recommend The Keg to anyone in the area or anyone planning to visit Tempe."}
{"text":"Filet mignon was a low quality. The guy next to us at the bar ordered a ribeye and said the same thing. Hard to chew. Tough to cut. So unfortunate"}
{"text":"I was very impressed with the ambience of this place, food and staff. Everyone was very friendly. I called ahead of time to check how long was the wait and from that initial contact I was a happy customer. When we arrived we didn't wait much to b seated. Once we were seated we were greeted my Hannah out waitress. She was very helpful because she went over the menu with us and pointed out her favorites. That was awesome because it helped us decide what we were going to order. 
Our appetizer came out immediately. Our salads followed. Let  me get into the food.. My husband ordered the Filet Mignon with the tiger shrimp. The meat was cooked to perfection very juicy and just delicious . I ordered from the keg classics. Let me say that my sirloin steak was simply amazing. It was cooked just as I ordered and once it hit my taste buds I was in heaven. To drink I had a strawberry mojito which was the best I've I had. Hannah again was very nice and made sure we had everything we needed. I will definitely come again when I visit arizona again"}
{"text":"Best place to spend your birthday with such a great ambience and food!!!"}
{"text":"We went to the Keg tonight to celebrate our 34th anniversary, kind of a big deal in our eyes. 
Dinner started off on the wrong foot when we called for a reservation and were told 8:15 was the soonest available, started looking for options and found a book on line option on their website,well we were able to book at 7:30? Seems odd butt we went for it and showed up early ready for dinner,hostess tells me well it will be late as we're busy? What's the sense of a reservation if it mans we get to you when we feel like it? At least that's the way the snooty hostess made me feel.
Ok so we sat in the bar waiting for our table and decided if there that busy we would just stay there, I asked the waitress if the full menu was available and she assured me yes we were good to go.
We orders our meals and proceed to wait and wait until finally our food showed up, we this is where it really went south!  My wife's steak was well to sum it up to tough to cut or eat to say. The least, we finally flagged down our waitress after a long delay and explained the problem, she agreed and offered to replace the steak on the Fly, her words not mine, my wife switched to prime rib as it is already one just needs to be sliced and plated well thirty minutes  later no prime rib, no waitress or anything else, after a long wait and attempts to catch someone with no success we decided to call it a night and move on.
At this point the manager came over and apologized for the way dinner went and offered to take off her meal, well this is ok since she didn't eat it? Long story short this is out second consecutive issue with ''this restaurant and all be our last, in the past we always had great service and excellent food s we spent all special ovations there, unfortunately we will NEVER go back due to the poor service and disappointing food on consecutive occasions."}
{"text":"Visited this location a couple weeks ago and I would absolutely consider bringing other friends here again. I've never really thought The Keg was anything amazing after a previous bad experience but I have nothing but great things to say about this location. 

We went on a night that wasn't busy so we were seated immediately. Our waiter was very attentive and checked up on us frequently but not too often to be excessive. We ordered steaks and I usually have trouble chewing a lot of meats but my steak was perfectly cooked for me. Decor and ambiance were on point, our food/drinks arrived in a timely manner, and overall, I think everything including the service makes the price well worth it. Looking forward to the next time I visit!"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious.  I came with a party of 6 and everything we ordered, from lobster tails to filet mignon was excellent.
The service was wonderful! Very attentive. 
You can't go by the other reviews when it comes to wait time...EVERY restaurant in San Tan has an extremely long wait on a weekend.  We made reservations the day before and were seated straightaway.  I believe it is one of the few restaurants in San Tan that accepts reservations."}
{"text":"Just got done eating at The Keg and WOW. What fantastic service to match the delicious food!!! Our server, Sydney, was super sweet and was very attentive. As active duty my husband and I don't get to get out very much and tonight really made our vacation something to remember. The next time we are in town we will most certainly be eating here again!!"}
{"text":"Best steakhouse restaurant service AND dinner ever for my boyfriend and I. We were very pleased and will definitely return and recommend to others!"}
{"text":"Very VERY good place.
I loved everything: the atmosphere (I was in their Lounge room), the attention-full waitress, the food. Everything.
I was there for lunch, before a flight. It is very close to the Toronto airport and therefore convenient.
The Lounge room has big TVs where you can see sports, and nice music (rock, definitely my taste).
I started with a Wedge, very good, and then had their Filet mignon (wrapped with bacon) medium rare, with sweet potatoes fries.
I got a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon with it (not the best choice, but my fault).
The meat was simply PERFECT. Cooked exactly as I love it, juicy and tender (thank you bacon). Perfect.
They also have their house bread which is surprisingly good (at least for a french guy like me often disappointed in the bread quality).
And they have espressos!!!!!
It is pricy but worth every penny.
Definitely a place now in my top 5 steakhouse.
Thank you!"}
{"text":"We arrived last night as they were near closing due to a slow night. The staff didn't miss a beat, they sat us immediately with smiles. Bill arrived at our table, greeted us with professionalism and that started the great dinner experience. Bill checked in on us occasionally but was not over bearing at all! My wife and I travel from out of state monthly here and we always stop in for dinner at The Keg. Keep up the great service Bill. By the way, the food was excellent as always."}
{"text":"Great place for good date night. The food is really good and the service is solid as well. If you don't want to play for the top dollar place but want a good dinner then this is the place."}
{"text":"The best steakhouse I have ever been to. The service was prompt and very friendly. We started with the mixed greens salad which had an amazing Dijon vinaigrette. The filet was cooked to a perfect medium rare. The lobster and sides were all very tasty as well. Next time I visit Arizona I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"My husband and I went in last night and had such great service. The restaurant was packed and had a few folks in for prom but our food was still prompt and delicious. We even had the manager Chris come by and check in a couple of times. We saw him running around attending to all the tables and people. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Excellent steak and lobster, service always above average. Nice semi fancy restaurant for special occasions. Wish they would bring back the sour dough bread, French is a poor substitute. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"UPDATE: I was very promptly contacted by a corporate representative of the Keg to try and make it up to me. I politely declined, but appreciated her offer. I also dined on 04/16 at the Oro Valley, AZ location with a group of clients and had a wonderful experience. Our experience in Desert Ridge seems to be isolated to this location and is not indicative of a corporate mindset.



I wanted to give this place the benefit of the doubt, I really did. I read the reviews that mentioned that this was not your normal chain restaurant...

Unfortunately, I was sorely disappointed. From top to bottom this place is....confusing. It's like the restaurant doesn't know what it wants to be. Does it want to be a fine steakhouse ala Capital Grille or Donovans? Or does it want to be a mid-priced chain restaurant with amazing food ala Houstons?

We were first seated outside. Bad choice. Cheap patio furniture (truly, we patron sports bars that have a more welcoming patio) and not very enjoyable. Switched to a booth/chair combo in the bar. Better ambiance for sure. Started off great with my wife ordering a great Malbec and after tasting hers, I ordered the same. Ordered a Ceasar salad which I couldn't finish because it was so overseasoned. Then started with the Garlic Shrimp Appetizer which again, was overseasoned. This dish is served in escargot dish, with 6 baby shrimps in the holes, baked some in sort of oil, onion, parley, oregano, garlic, et al seasoning oil, and then smothered in cheddar cheese. It's one weird dish. After \"enjoying\" those two, I literally couldn't taste anything because of so many confusing flavors in my mouth. 

She ordered the filet which was alright (but overpriced - close to $40 for what looked and tased no better than something you can pick up at the grocery) and I order the New York Strip. When ordering steaks, you can choose \"Chicago style\" which is more seared almost to a char on the outside and prepared to your liking on the inside. Being a Chicago native, my mind instantly sprang to the beauty that is a Gibson's Charred Steak. If you've ever been to Gibsons (arguably the best steakhouse in the entire country), you know what I am talking about. Boy was I wrong again. It tasted like someone took a sirloin, burnt it to a crisp with a car exhaust pipe and called it prepared to my liking. I would normally send it back, but since there was a theme developing, I decided to cut my losses and try to get out as quick as possible. 

There are two redeeming factors. First, the Malbec is excellent and the twice-baked potatoes everyone references are what they're cracked up to be. The only two reasons I am not giving this a 1-star rating.

We opted out of dessert (went to get a Pizookie at BJ's Brewhouse instead) and paid the overpriced bill. I am not a cheapskate, and I enjoy very nice restaurants, but this was a bit rediculous for a chain. Over $100 for the two of us, for entrees and a glass of wine each. 

I hate to say this, but save yourself the trouble. Go to a restaurant that knows who they are. If you're going to go to a chain steak place, just go to Outback. You'll save yourself an expensive learning experience and the steaks are better there...seriously."}
{"text":"Bit pricie but worth it. Cozy, dim lighting atmosphere makes it  a nice place to take your date on. Ordered the peppercorn steak. Yum!"}
{"text":"We frequent the Keg often however, that will cease.   The last two times we were there, our food was horrible.  We're done."}
{"text":"When I dined at the keg I ordered the Roasted Chicken.  It was a little dry but still very good.  My date had the lobster and it was good.  For desert we had the miner pie and the brownie thing and they were both very good.  Our tab with one beer was $140.00 including tip.

Good service almost too good.  We were trying to have a conversation and were interrupted several times to be asked if they could take our still full plates.  When we tried to get the waitperson to wait for a break in the conversation he then drummed his fingers on the table to get our attention.  We both just sat there in shock at his rudeness and shook our heads."}
{"text":"I was sitting at the bar and the bartender was great  He was super attentive and a great conversationalist. The food came out quick. The drinks were top notch. Great experience."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for his birthday dinner. We were blown away! The food is amazing, our server was attentive and friendly. It's a little fancier than what we expected, but we could not be happier and will be returning in the future. Make sure you make a reservation - even during the middle of the week they are packed!"}
{"text":"I normally always try to be light-hearted with reviewing venues for food, but I'm going to just throw this out there for everyone..

First time eating at The Keg and I must say for the amount of money they charge for the food, I could have gotten twice the meal for a much better quality elsewhere. I went there for my birthday with my entire family (there were 8 of us total). 

Though the wait staff was very friendly and attentive to our drinks and such (hence the reason for the only stars on this review), the food was not worth the price. I ordered the steak and crab legs meal. This wasn't cheap! The meat wasn't done to what I asked (medium rare), and was way overcooked. My brother ordered the same thing and they had forgotten one of his sides. The cut of meat was definitely smaller than a filet mignon. Nothing earth-shattering about the meat cut either. No biggie, right? But the \"crab\" was ONE LEG That's right... ONE LEG. The vegetables that were served were dried out and almost room temperature like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for a while. This entrée was over $50!!!!!!! Though I saw this on the menu, when it came out I nearly fell off my chair. Sadly, I was still hungry when I left.
When I asked the waiter if this is all that came with it, he just nodded and walked away. 

I really had high hopes for this venue, but needless to say it was my first, and easily my last visit. Outside of the atmosphere, if you're looking for more meal for your buck, definitely look elsewhere. Ruth Chris prices for a meal you could get at Outback Steakhouse."}
{"text":"I've been here on previous occasions, not sure why I never wrote a rvw previously - maybe because each time was just not memorable.  This one was - and not in a good way.

The funny thing is, we had just attended a Yelp event @ P.I.G. and I really wanted a nice glass of wine, so I was wearing my name tag with Yelp on it (Ooops).  When the Bar Staff saw it, I took it off right away - BUT don't you think that may have prompted a little bit of nice or prompt service, just a tad????

Nope.  
Poor guy next to us had been visiting on a reg. basis many, many times and could not believe how bad the service was this nite.  We each had our bill sit, with our credit cards in full view, for 30 mins when we had to ask the server to ring us out - much to her dismay at being pulled way from her current task at hand: polishing that one glass for over 20 mins.  He also mentioned he always obtained comp. potato crisps, which I saw all around us, but none were offered in our direction?

During that time, we saw a group of 6 business men come in, sit down in the lounge chairs and never get an acknowledgment, greeting, menu, or service.  We're talking $100 just for 1 round of drinks here!  1 had to approach the bar and ask for a server, and ours practically rolled her eyes and muttered someone will be over shortly.  Let me tell you, this place was far from busy!  Everyone shot out at the stroke of HH ending like crazy so it was pretty empty by this time.

I see no reason to ever return - at all."}
{"text":"The Keg is always really tasty in the sense that there is a lot of salt, fat, and red meat. You can almost never go wrong with a combination of those components, and the meal I had at the Keg was success in all those areas. 

Upon being seated in the always dimly lit dining room, one of my dining companions inquired, \"What do you think it looks like in here when the lights are on?\"
  \"Kinda grungy, I would imagine.\"
  \"Yeah, like kinda dated from the 90's.\"
  \"Yeah.\"

Nevertheless, service was really wonderful; attentive and helpful and our server only appearing at the right times.

Food was exactly as expected. Prime rib dinner with salad and baked potato. Prime rib was very good, baked potato was excellent, as it was slathered with butter, sour cream, bacon bits, and chives. Salad and side of vegetables were expectedly underwhelming. Brownie sundae for dessert also expectedly overwhelming, but fulfilling my fat and sugar needs after a salty, fatty, red meat meal.

I like the Keg for what it is, and am always up for a trip where I can get predictable, solid, tasty, red meat with appropriate accompaniments."}
{"text":"This location is the worst Keg restaurant I have been to.  I have been there twice and will not go back.
The food is mediocre but the worst part is the service. 
Other Keg usually have professional and experienced wait staff, but here they are all really young females in the 18-22 age range.  They seem very inexperienced and have a casual attitude like at a diner or breakfast restaurant.  Ours didn't even say hi or introduce herself.  Was often late coming around and seemed bothered when asked questions about the menu she obviously didn't know about. 
Maybe the manager should hire some professional wait staff and not college girls just because they look pretty in a short dress.  If I am paying $20-30 for service, I would like to get service that is worth it!
One more thing, the dining room has really poor ventilation and poor temperature control. Both times it was too hot to bear."}
{"text":"Food is so good! Get a steak, not chicken or fish. It may be a little more expensive than other comparable steak houses the quality is far better than others I've had.  So, it'll be well worth it.  The prime rib amd New York steaks are my favorites. The prime rib is made that day, fresh, so sometimes it sells out early. No reserve. The wait staff and management is always on their game. If you have a complaint they are serious about it and want to make it right. The weekend and holidays are crazy so be sure to make a reservation in advance.  Long wait times for the dinner rush is typical and even longer for special occasions like Valentines Day and Mothers Day. Great atmosphere. They dim the lights after a certain hour. If the weather is nice out make sure to sit outside. Really nice ambiance but, if you want something more fun then sit in the bar. It's open seating and can feel more like a club there's so many people on a Friday night. There's fireplaces throughout and tvs in the bar with DirecTV but none outside or the main restaurant. They have a good selection for happy hour food and drinks. The parking lot assigned to the restaurant is a bit small so you may have to park across and walk over."}
{"text":"To be honest I didn't come for steaks but came to the bar with my friend for the first time. We usually hang out at some of the asian bars near us, but we decided to try something different. At the bar, the asian girl working on friday night was sooo friendly. Then we met Israel who chatted with us for a bit and took the time to show us the upstairs outdoor patio. So now we are sold on this place! We have been looking for a bar to call a second home in our area and this one is on our list. 
Thanks Israel for taking the time to show us the place. Whoever is your manager sure did a great job of training the staff. Ultimately we will come back because we like nice friendly service , oh and the happy hour specials too:) 
Filipino guy who was cleaning up behind the bar was also really sweet and energetic.  Great staff.

{"text":"They have a lot of beers on tap, if you are not working. The lunch sized portions as just about right and good."}
{"text":"Had a delicious meal for Valentine's Day!!  It was our first visit to The Keg and it definitely will be at the top of the list for a place to go to celebrate a special occasion!  Our steaks were cooked perfectly, I had the New York Strip and my husband had the Prime Rib. We had a bottle of 7 Oaks Cabernet which was delicious!  Our server was Justin and he did a great job! It was busy but he was friendly and very attentive. When we left we walked around San Tan Village and realized we forgot our doggy bag (ok no we don't have a doggy) but we stopped back and he had it for us (no idea where he had it, maybe dug it out of the trash and put it in a fresh bag?! Haha) but anyway, I highly recommend The Keg and look forward to going back! Next time we'll sit out on the patio which looks very inviting!  Oh and we did have a reservation which is recommended for indoor seating!"}
{"text":"We are regulars of The Keg but the Brampton location was a first for us. We went for New Year's eve it was busy but The Keg is always busy. Service was awesome but the kitchen was a disaster that night. Steak was over cooked (well done when asked for medium), garlic mashed potatoes for all 3 parties at our table were nasty, resemble to a truck stop instant potatoes. Dry and not mash properly which resulted in a very low quality meal. Expecting more of a Keg for sure will not be back to the Brampton location. Great service thought the server changed the steak but brought back the same pot of potatoes which means the same potatoes were put back in my plate.."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time at Sherway. Service was very slow, steak was good, brownie for dessert was very very dry. Overall really slow service and probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Very nice place, service was fantastic and the food was too.  I found my meal to be a little over priced."}
{"text":"This restaurant is great! We always have great service here and he food is always yummy! We enjoy the good quality food and the warm atmosphere."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service. We met the nicest server Courtney and always try to sit at one of her tables. The manager very friendly and kept checking on us. We always start with the Santa Fe Chicken Dip never enough!
The filets and prime rib have the best flavor. My husband loves the lobster.
Great romantic atmosphere. We look forward to our next dinner."}
{"text":"Went to the Keg this week for a birthday celebration. The filet mignon
Steak was fantastic as usual. My husband ordered the lobster and shrimp salad but was disappointed as he could hardly find the shrimp or lobster in the salad. Without making a big deal of the situation, my husband voiced his opinion about the salad to the manager. The manager was very nice and offered to bring him some additional shrimp etc. My husband stated that it was not necessary but the manager did bring him some additional seafood. I like how the manager turned this situation into a positive experience and \"recovered\" customers who may not have returned. The customer service is excellent and I believe they will always try to make the customer happy."}
{"text":"The wait staff at the keg is truly amazing. Matt B and the manager Taylor were superb. Not to mention the food was excellent!"}
{"text":"We had filet mignon, twice baked potatoes, and the appetizer was the stuffed mushrooms.  Steaks were great.  Twice baked potatoes were good.  Appetizer was okay.  We loved the bread.  The wait staff was exceptional!"}
{"text":"Caesar Salad
Kansas City Strip
Key Lime Pie

Caesar light on anchovy; I should have asked for a little extra.  8 a little more anchovy paste or better yet a couple of anchovies would have landed a 10.

Strip was perfect. Yes to the crushed black pepper.  Ordered and delivered blue rare. A solid10.

Key Lime wonderful. I asked for raspberry coulis to be held. Key Lime had right combo of sweetness and lime tartness.  

Service from Gabe was very good once he calmed down.  Seemed a bit rushed initially.  Could be a bit more personal.  Started out wanting to know about me, but that faded. His attentiveness was spot on.  Checked in appropriately.  I wanted just a few more seconds with him on each visit. With that said, he gets an 8.5.  But he's cute and I am being hard on him so tip will be good."}
{"text":"Food:  The irony is that I have never tried the steaks here but what I usually have to eat is in the photos attached.
Firstly the food is amazing, fresh and filling but yes pricy. 

Secondly, you are always served with a complimentary bread and butter appetizer. Although it is a tad bit hard to cut with the knife. It's a good starter, not so hard neither that soft. 

Thirdly, the chicken and shrimp is always perfectly cooked, fresh vegetables and rice. The sauces and dips perfectly compliment the dinner p?ate. I'm not a huge fan of seafood but they do have a nice selection of seafood like the crab cakes as an appetizer comes by twos. It's a creamy filling in the middle and crusty base. 

Fourthly, I fell in love with the forbidden Fruit Martini which has vodka cranberry juice and pomegranate juice and couple of other mixtures. I can't find anything similar anywhere else. One thing has changed that in 2013 you would get more quantity of it with less ice but In 2014 it has a huge block of ice which can be seen in my picture. 
 
Fourthly have heard a lot of about the steak. Hope to try it on my next visit. 

Customer service:  I've been to this location number of times and the staff is always so friendly and welcoming. Our waiter and waitresses are well informed of the menu along with the specials. 

Ambience:  Very classy and elegant, dark with dim lights. Perfect for couples or small groups. Quiet and peaceful.  

Overall experience:  if you're looking for a nice quiet peaceful dinner out with healthy alternative, give this location a chance. The Downfall is that the dinner plates cost between $25-29 even more but definitely lives up to the quality of the food."}
{"text":"I would love to give this place a great rating because my family and I dine here all the time, but unfortunately our last experience was horrible. Our server Nikki was amazing but our experience was ruined at the host stand. These girls are the first people who welcome you into the restaurant but the red haired girl \"running the board\" was so rude, didn't smile and was not welcoming whatsoever. I spoke to a manager about what happened and he handled the situation by making the girl come over to the table and apologize which was not only horribly uncomfortable for her, but for my family as well. The manager gave us a free cake and said that she was still in the process of becoming a lead host but if this is the best host that this place has and the manager feels that a carrot cake will solve the problem is embarrassing, and that is truly a shame."}
{"text":"Service and food were awesome! Highly recommend the French onion soup. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Great servers, the steak was not the best, kind of tough. The side dishes are amazing. They used to have a birthday list and you get a free meal but they told me to go sign up on line and I still didn't receive my birthday meal. A little overpriced for this economy, but the service was so good and atmostphere was so excellent, I go back many times."}
{"text":"Stopped by for my birthday meal and received an excellent steak, excellent service and a free desert.  The manager came by twice to make sure all was well......"}
{"text":"My waitress Taylor took about 15 min. To come over to take my order after greeting me and after making eye contact several times. It wasn't busy I'm here. I e been here several times before and have never received such poor service. I'm very disappointed and if I had not already ordered food I would have left. I won't be coming back if she's my server. Very unprofessional and disappointed. My order was wrong, and she never came back to check on me. Only cared about her friends or co-workers that were here."}
{"text":"Service and food was amazing.  Had a bit of a wait to get in, but definitely was worth the wait.  Prices a dash on the higher end of the spectrum but when your dealing with quality you need to expect to pay more.  At the end of the night and a $120 less in my pocket I can definitely say it was more than worth it."}
{"text":"I've been to the locations at Desert Ridge and Chandler and this was, by far, the best experience of them all.

We were there to celebrate my Mom's birthday and we weren't disappointed in the slightest.  The food was its usual great self but the service stole the show.  Very attentive staff on a Saturday night and our server, Leo, was a perfect 10/10.  We have  a 1-year old and he engaged him several times throughout the meal, including returning him to our table after he had snuck off:).  We never had to wait or ask for anything.

We dine out quite a bit and I rarely write reviews so take this for what it's worth, you won't be disappointed in the slightest in choosing The Keg Tempe for your next nice meal and experience!"}
{"text":"I took my honey here on his birthday, and Im glad I did. Nice ambiance inside, friendly staff and hostesses. I ordered the bacon wrapped filet and lobster tail and he the chicken and scallops. Everything was cooked well, and the steak was seasoned perfectly. Way better than Montis steakhouse. lol. The twice baked potatoes and veggies were awesome too. The wine list is extensive, and they gave him a free billy miner pie for his bday dessert, which was delicious. We left quite happy, and we tend to be picky eaters. We will definitely go back. Prices aren't bad at all for steak My only complaint was that we got our food only a couple minutes after out appetizer arrived, not giving us any time to eat it, and the table became over crowded. The waitress did apologize but oh well."}
{"text":"Definitely worth the visit. Not only are the servers really friendly and professional, they are very open and inviting as well! 

The food took a little while to come to us but it was still warm by the time it arrived to the table. I ordered the Teriyaki sirloin along with an Atlantic salmon tail and everything was cooked to perfection! I definitely would recommend coming back here again!"}
{"text":"The food is fabulous!  Our bacon wrapped filet was the best steak we've ever had.  Service by Elissa was excellent!  Garlic shrimp, twice baked potato & veggies very tasty.  Cocktails excellent too!  If you go hungry, it's your own fault. Lol"}
{"text":"Took a client to The Keg @ Desert Ridge for dinner and was happy overall. The tempura asparagus....YUMMMM! The patio is nice except for the uncomfortable unpadded chairs. The wait staff was attentive and friendly (my male client appreciated the short skimpy black dresses, therefore, so did I;)
If you want a decent meal that doesnt feel froo froo , good choice."}
{"text":"As always, the service was excellent!  I love audra in the bar, she is very attentive and really loves people."}
{"text":"I ate at the bar, little slow in noticing my presence at the bar, rather expensive for the quality or lack there of. Bartenders were very nice, food mediocre! My filet was a little tough and over cooked from what I ordered . They have two choices for wines by the glass, a 6 oz and a 9 oz. I was not given a choice, the bartender just defaulted to the 9 oz! All said, value perception for the price just not there.T"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Asked for takeout and they informed me after an hour that there was no Billy Milner's pie available.  Wasn't given any updates and was just left hanging."}
{"text":"The Keg is a fairly large chain restaurant but I've only been to the one located in Chandler. It looks like they have locations throughout the US and Canada.

I've been here a couple of times now and have found that the steaks are much better than the prime rib. The last time I went, I had the 20 oz rib eye. It was pretty awesome and cooked perfectly medium-rare. The prime ribs are decent....but pales in comparison to House of Prime Rib in SF.

I recommend getting the baked potato as a side dish and ask for the triple cheese butter. In fact, ask for extra triple cheese butter. It's that good."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going to the Desert Ridge location every week for many years and have enjoyed the service and quality of the food. We have become part of the Keg family over these many years. The Bar Staff has always greeted us with a big smile. I highly recommend the Prime Rib and Filets. The French Onion Soup is the best in town !
Jim and Alice S."}
{"text":"It was our first time coming here and I must say the appetizers are amazing as well as the drinks and service! One huge mistake in our meal though. Both my husband and I ordered the rib steak cooked the same way. His came out about a half inch thicker than mine and perfect med rare. Mine on the other hand looked more like a pork chop. Thin and gray throughout.  Both steaks were covered in so much pepper they were hard to eat. Especially mine! We took them home and gave to dogs. Unfortunately they ate a very expensive cut of meat and not us. If it wasn't for this huge mistake everything else was definitely top quality!"}
{"text":"This is an excellent steakhouse that doesn't break the bank like some of the top-end places do. We first went to Keg on our honeymoon in Whistler, B.C. and loved it. The food is very good and their steaks are a good quality in both cut and taste. The staff is professional and knowledgeable and steaks actually come out the way you asked! 

Their escargot is pretty good, not amazing, but pretty good. We really like the mushrooms neptune, too. Their wedge salad is good and is nice to share before dinner. Their portions on both steak and sides are ample. We have always enjoyed our meals here. I will say, I am always a little shocked when I get the bill but that's ok, we consider this to be a \"nice night out\" without having to travel far from home."}
{"text":"My husband and I go here at least 3 times a year and are NEVER disappointed. The food has always been amazing. No complaints, at all. My husband always gets the same thing, peppercorn NY steak and I change it up. His steak has always been amazing, they are very consistent. We always get an appetizer and sometimes a dessert. If you get dessert, the Billy Miner pie will not disappoint. We were so full but we made room because it was nothing short of delicious. We will continue to go back.
Their prices are well matched for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"I love this place, drinks and food are wonderful. The bartenders kick ass!"}
{"text":"We went here on a Saturday night at around 4ish 5. You would assume that's an early dinner; but when we arrived, we were told the dining room would have a 2 to 2.5 hours wait unless we have a reservation. Luckily for us, the patio and bar area was open and barely anyone was there. 
My fiancé and I had a wonderful time. He ordered the New York Strip and I had the half lobster and 6oz steak. Luckily for me, this was the day they had lobster and it was so succulent. I finished the whole thing even though I was beyond full. 
So, if you come here on a lobster night, please get the lobster. Even though it is expensive, it is well worth it. The best part about this dinner was that we didn't even say anything to our waiter, Kane; but, he asked if we were celebrating anything tonight. It was like he knew! We told him we were celebrating our one year anniversary and he was like \"Congrats\" and at the end of our meal, brought us out an ice cream desert which had oreos and caramel and fudge. 
Our server, Kane, was super great at servicing us; we would go back just for him!"}
{"text":"Decent drinks. The sliders had a weird texture. We were informed that they are made from prime rib, which contributes to the texture. The staff was very accomodating and removed the sliders from the bill. Would visit again avoiding the sliders. I'm actually excited about trying a steak at the Keg."}
{"text":"Wife and I went there this past weekend.  I ordered the NY strip and she ordered the chicken.  Both dishes were good, but not great.  We felt like we were rushed and the service was sub par.  I would definitely recommend a run of the mill steakhouse of this high priced joint in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Just writing another review because I love this place lol! Came here with my fiancé on Monday for happy hour and we stayed for 4 hours!! 

We ordered prime rib sliders, garlic shrimp, and later a keg burger (delicious! I'm not normally a burger person.) I also had 2 margaritas and 2 glasses of red wine (lol.) They definitely give you a nice pour of the wine. 

Our server Jordan was amazing! She was super sweet and attentive but never overbearing. She never made us feel rushed at all. Service is always consistent in the lounge area I've noticed

I've only been to the keg for happy hour, but I have heard great things about their full menu also. Love the keg!"}
{"text":"The Keg Steakhouse and Bar was a pleasant surprise!  I was looking for somewhere to meet my friend after work, and happened upon The Keg at Tempe Marketplace.  I love the dark atmosphere inside, and there is also the option of a very comfortable and inviting outdoor patio.  The service was great, the servers were friendly and conversational, and the food was to die for!.  My friend and I ordered the bacon-wrapped scallops and the warm goat cheese rolled in almonds and served with tomato basil salsa.  Both were delicious, but the goat cheese and salsa blew me away!  In addition, for those who drink they have an extensive (and reasonably priced) drink menu, with some unique and interesting concoctions (some day I'll have to try a martini with egg white froth), and wine by the glass is half price during happy hour.  I enjoyed a lovely white zin in the \"Keg size\" 9 oz glass for only $4.00!  All in all, it was a very pleasant and sophisticated atmosphere, the food was great, and the prices were in line with your typical TGI Friday's or Applebee's, both of which pale by comparison.  Actually, they more than pale, they turn ghastly white and keel over from the pressure of even trying to come close to comparing...The Keg Steakhouse and Bar FTW!"}
{"text":"I will preface this review by saying I did not have a steak here and I will definitely come back to try one. 

Instead I was here for happy hour.  They have a few drink specials and some snacks for happy hour.  I had mushrooms Neptune and baked garlic shrimp.  The baked garlic shrimp was covered in a big layer of cheese that was way too much.  The shrimp were hiding.  The mushrooms were good - but again so much cheese and cream.   The two dishes together were too heavy but were only $4 each.  I also had an orange martini that was pretty sweet.   

The server was awesome though.  Always had a smile on her face and made sure we were taken care of."}
{"text":"We've been wanting to try this place for quite awhile now. When we recently had family come into town we had the perfect opportunity and were really excited based on the reviews.....unfortunately it was a  disappointing experience.  We arrived just after 6 and ordered about 15 min later. A short time later we were offered bread.....4 slices for 6 people. The request for additional bread it seems was forgotten. The food arrived at 7:50....about an hour and a half after ordering. We started with the lobster bisque which was actually quite good, the issue is that we still had no silverware. After requesting a spoon for a second time I did get one...unfortunately it still had chocolate lip print left on it from a previous patron. A clean spoon was provided... ok, things happen. For the main course I had ordered a sirloin, med-rare. When I cut into it, it was clear that it was somewhere between med-well and well. The server came back to ask how everything was and immediately said, \"is that a little too well done, yeah I knew that was over cooked..\" If it was suspect, I'm not sure why it would still be served? A second steak had already been put in....good on the staff but again, if there was a known issue, why bring the first one? The second steak was prepared as ordered, though it arrived 10 min after the rest of the family was done eating so they got to sit there and watch me as I ate. The food quality was a little above average, worth $20-25.....the issue was that it was priced at $39. To the staff's credit, I feel they recognized that it was not an exemplary experience, certainly
not what one would expect for the prices paid,  and they did remove the charge for my meal, hence the third star."}
{"text":"Food was wonderful.  Highly recommend the fillet with lobster tail. It was a very busy night so staff is a little slow but other than that always a thumbs up and a five star review"}
{"text":"We just got back in from having a wonderful Sunday evening dinner at the Tempe Keg - Dylan was fantastic tonight; he took great care of us plus was fun & very personable."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday evening and it was pretty busy but we got right in.  The beer was cold and the min bottle of champagne hit the spot.

We got the crab stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer and they were delicious.

We ordered the salmon and steak and crab.  Everything was VERY good.

We'll be back soon.  It was expensive but not like other steak houses."}
{"text":"Great steakhouse. Both traditional and upbeat. Great vibe. Started off with a wonderful server - Nikki. Perfectly prepared Sazerac for me and a straight up Hendrick's Martini for my wife began our experience. We both had the onion soup which was excellent - good balance of broth, bread and cheese.  Next the wedge salad for me and a Caesar for my mate. While a little light on the dressing, the staff was eager to bring more. The prime rib was done medium rare and on point. It came with sides of sautéed mushrooms and creamed spinach. A bottle of organic Malbec from Argentina rounded our special night."}
{"text":"Horrible Experience!  Waiter lacked manners and was more interested in getting a date with the table next door then he was to making sure other tables were taken care of. Went there Monday evening for my boyfriends birthday.  Been there before but never had this bad of service.  Issue with the food, but that wasn't the issue...while trying to share with the waiter what the problem was..he walked away...and manager when she showed up...didn't listen either...guess they're too busy to want repeat business....won't be giving them my monies in the future...issues happen but how they are dealt with is what matters.  Very disappointed with the waiter and manager's attention.  The only person that seemed to care was the kitchen manager and it wasn't her fault.  Guess this chain thinks that people skills are not important -

Update-  the manager finally called me 3 days later...we spoke briefly-  during that conversation he was going to check into whether the server noted about the allergies...  week later and I'm still waiting for that phone call back from the manager...  He was so quick to defend the lousy service and issue with the meal that he has not contacted me back....  kept apologizing but did NOTHING TO MAKE IT RIGHT!"}
{"text":"I'm honestly not much of a steak person, but when my family visited a while ago, they chose this restaurant. We went in without ever having heard of it, and we were not disappointed. 

The service was excellent, and the steaks were as well. I believe our server was named Chris. I could be mistaken, he had this New York accent, and he was incredibly nice and helpful with my menu selection.

This place is expensive, but if you have the means, or a special occasions, I highly suggest checking this place out. I knew I wasn't a steak person, so I chose one of the cheaper steaks, it was a top sirloin. 

After I went to this place, I wanted to try more steakhouses out, but the other ones were just okay. Go here if you want to show someone a good steak!"}
{"text":"The place is pretty comfortable and the prices aren't that bad. It's more a 3.5

I had the bone in rib steak and I ordered it medium. as most of the times in almost every place I go, they overcooked it :(

The house pinoit noir was decent and in general the food was pretty good for the money.

The service was friendly but no refills on the water and the waitress never came back to ask if I would like another glass of wine. I would if she asked, but that never happened.

All in all, a good place to go, not super expensive and ok service."}
{"text":"Visited tonight based on the positive reviews, but feel that it is has not lived up to the hype and is not worth the cost at all. Dad had a steak, rated it a 7 out of 10. Burger and prime rib sliders were a major disappointment and did not get eaten. Chicken dishes were ok but not worthy of $22 or whatever the price was. Worth $14 at best. Tuna tacos passable but the tuna was chilled and not seared to order. Service was ok but definitely missing the fine dining quality one would expect in a place like this. Apps were nice enough but overall I see no reason to return."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. The moment we walked in, we were greeted by the hostess. We gave her the name the reservation was under and we were immediately sat. The server, regrettably I do not remember her name, was top notch. She was very friendly, patient and knowledgeable of the menu. We did not feel rushed or felt like \"just another table.\" I had the Keg classic top sirloin. It comes with a salad, option for the salad are: Caesar salad, house salad, or wedge salad. I chose the wedge salad with blue cheese. The steak also comes with your choice of side. I got the fresh veggie, which was asparagus. 

The wedge salad was a huge portion, it is topped with blue cheese dressing, blue cheese crumbles, chopped bacon and chopped tomato. It was really good, the blue cheese dressing is really creamy. The steak was perfectly seasoned. Mushrooms, grilled red pepper and asparagus were an excellent choice to compliment the steak. 

Although the cheesecake sounded really good, we were all really full. Great place for dinner. We will be back again."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for a low lit bar, jazzy music and a subtle southwestern atmosphere, then this is the place. Service as the bar was excellent and menu is descent. Bar is completely separate from the restaurant which gives the impression that you are in a private lounge."}
{"text":"I find there are very few establishments that do what I would really call 'good business' still left in the world.  I'm sure there are plenty I just run in to them every once in a rare while.  The Keg is one of them.

Two stories:

The first time I went here my friend and I just wanted a good steak so we searched out yelp and found The Keg was close.  Right off the bat I noticed the atmosphere was pretty nice, nothing over the top, but enjoyable.  I also noticed that the wait staff knew their shit.  Our waitress explained all the specials and recommended her favorites without hesitation.  The real highlight was before our food came when the manager came over and asked us if it was our first time.  He then brought us a shrimp cocktail on the house to kick off our meal.  

The second visit was for a friend's birthday.  We ordered a round of chocolate cake shots and the manager showed up to mix them himself and bought us our first round.  He also gave us each recipes to take home with us. 

The food on both occasions was great, I haven't had a good cut of meat like it since I left the midwest.  The wait staff is friendly and attentive, and I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Came here with my friend for her Birthday.  They have the greatest Birthday deal in town. If you sign up on their website and give your Birthday information they will send you a Birthday certificate where you  will get an entire free meal for your Birthday. It is quite amazing!   The food is excellent and the staff very knowledgeable.   It was the first time i had ever been here, but i can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I just had the most delicious 8 oz. sirloin for dinner and the best part is...I got it to go!

I just got back from spending a month in New York City (where there are no The Keg Steakhouse and Bar and I was sad). The Keg was the first real meal I've had since I got home.

The staff greeted me immediately. The manager was very nice, helpful, and was in a chef's jacket which means he himself cooks.

My steak was cooked perfectly to medium rare. The oversized healthy vegetables were great and the garlic mashed potatoes and side cesar salad complemented the entire meal well.

I literally just finished eating and was so pleased I had to post here on Yelp. It's a little pricey, but it's worth it. Bon' a petite!"}
{"text":"My husband and I started coming to the keg for special occasions many years ago when we were younger and just starting out in our business. As our business has grown we've made going to the keg something we do a bit more often because the food is fantastic and the staff is attentive and kind and courteous. I would highly suggest making the keg your special spot as well!"}
{"text":"We came here for a steak dinner, knowing it was in a shopping center, on the cheaper side for a steakhouse, and it was going to be casual. We left really impressed by the service and atmosphere and totally under estimated how nice it was. 

The patio seating here is warm and cozy when the fireplace is lit and its mild out. I would ask to sit there if its not too hot. This place is the perfect location for dinner and a movie as the theatre is right in the same center. 

Ordered the filet mignon rare and it was pretty fatty. Rare is really rare here just like the menu says, so keep that in mind. The baked potato side was fine, nothing exciting. I really loved the Spinach Salad with the pecans, mandarin oranges and cranberries. The salad dressing was very good. I recommend starting with that. 

Overall really good attentive service and a great atmosphere for dinner on the patio."}
{"text":"We came here for Thanksgiving dinner. The service was awesome, the food was very good. I had the top sirloin  and side of mashed potato and also the twice baked potato both were very good. The steak was the best I've had in a long time. I give them 10!"}
{"text":"Our visit tonight was fantastic. It was our first visit to the new Sherway Gardens location. First, parking was quick and easy - the new multi-level parking garage right next to the restaurant is high-tech, simple, and much needed. 

Next, we were greeted instantly and given the option of sitting at the bar to have drinks and apps (there was a 40-50 minute wait). We ended up being so comfortable at a nice table for two in the bar that we ate our whole meal there! (the bar is full service/full menu - just as the dining room is). 

Hailey was our waitress and she was very attentive - often checking on refills of our drinks and ensuring we always had fresh water. In addition, I have Celiac Disease - which I noted to her, she provided us with a gluten free menu. When I ordered my meal she reiterated what would be removed and soon after a manager came over to verify and ensure me that I would leave there happier than when I arrived. 

We were treated with such respect and diligence, it was nice to know that they seemed to truly care how we were enjoying our night (even just in the bar!). Similarly, the food is what you'd expect at the keg - delicious (so much so, that I forgot to take a picture). 

Overall, I would absolutely recommend this location - it's beautiful,  has great service, and excellent food. See you again soon #KegSherway !"}
{"text":"You know, the food was tasty.  The prices for the food were outrageous in my opinion, I would have expected TOP NOTCH for those prices and the food wasn't up to par, but what's more is the sexual dress attire they make the women wear!  Breasts were hanging out, and let's just say you don't need a waitress leaning over your husband at the table, with breasts in his face when dropping off your food.  The only way he could stay away from seeing skin tight clothing was to close his eyes eating there!  Let's just say, our family doesn't support that.  It's demeaning to women in general, takes our appetites away, and honestly, we might as well eat at HOOTERS."}
{"text":"The worst rib-eye I have ever had.  Lots of fat and really chewy!  The waiter promptly took it back and they made a new one, absolutely perfect!!  They even bought us a round of drinks for the inconvenience, great customer service!!"}
{"text":"What a find. I never heard of this chain and after eating here I was so annoyed I ate a completely average steak at Longhorn the night before for $10 less. I had the ribeye and it was as good as any I've had. It was clearly well aged, not overly fatty and cooked PERFECT! The staff was very attentive too. What a great random choice I will eat here every night when I come back to the area for work!"}
{"text":"Went to the Keg for my sis n law's  birthday on 5/27/2015. I had their special, which was awesome. Everyone else had the prime rib. They requested medium rare, unfortunately came out medium. Which is okay because they said it was still tasty. There was no need to complain, however the manager came by our table and asked how was the food. We simply mentioned the steak was a lil over cooked. Of course, he apologized and offered to bring another plate. We gracefully declined. After our plates were taken away, the manager brought us deserts. One of each flavor. We definitely appreciate the gesture. We thought the manager handle it well and knows how to keep customers coming back."}
{"text":"I love steak. It's my favorite food, my dying wish, my best friend and my version of PMS Ice Cream. I really, truly love steak. Some people (my mother) attribute it to my O+ Blood Type, others to my very outdoorsy/hunting family, and my vegetarian friends just think it's because I'm nuts. But no matter the reason, it's the best thing since The Big Bang. For this reason, I feel uniquely qualified to review a steakhouse, and even more so because I once worked at one of the best in the state.

As a college student who has a discriminating palate and a thin wallet, I take advantage of good deals when I find 'em - and The Keg has an AMAZING deal for you. For your birthday and/or anniversary, they send you an email redeemable for a free entrée of some type. Last year was Caesar Salad, Prime Rib,  and your choice of side. This year is an 8oz Sirloin with the same accoutrements.  So sign up for their birthday/anniversary club, you definitely won't regret it.

The steak I had last night for my birthday was really pretty good! I'm not much of a sirloin lover - I prefer Rib Eye because of the juicy flavors from more marbling, but this Red Meat Lover would never turn down a steak. The Top Sirloin was tender, moist, and had a really good flavor. AND they cooked it to my perfect Medium-Rare specifications. As my side, I chose the Twice Baked Potato; I wish they had brought me three more, they were so delicious! The Caesar Salad was pretty good, but the dressing wasn't anchovy-ey enough for me. 

Overall, I wouldn't kick The Keg out of my bed, and I would probably invite it in. I only go here once a year because it's all I can afford at this point, but if I had the $$$, I would  definitely go back more frequently!!"}
{"text":"*UPDATE* Just got word that one of the diners at our table got food poisoning and is sick AF today. She had the bacon-wrapped steak. 

One star for the experience, three stars for their attempt to make things right = two star average.

Came here for a friend's bday on a Monday night. You'd figure that service would be a bit better on a day where the restaurant wasn't packed but that certainly was not the case. 

We were a table of ten on the second floor patio (at the insistence of the restaurant too- who said that we didn't need to make a reservation for a Monday night). Our server was very nice and prompt to update us and I'm sure very little of what happened was her fault. 

Several hiccups:
 
- My French onion soup came out, and the bus boy said that the other one was \"coming right out\", which would imply that it was just waiting to be brought out. This was not the case and the bday girl had to ask when it was coming out, only to have it appear 15 minutes later.
- The mains on the other side of the table appeared without steak knives. We had to prompt the server to bring them. 
- A burger and a steak collided into each other on the way to us, so they of course offered to put a new one on. The bday girl opted not to get her steak at all because we would have all been done eating already. The other girl who ordered the burger was offered a salad in the mean time as her burger was being re-made. Her salad never came out. Her burger came out maybe another 15 minutes later. 
- While the individuals who didn't have their food yet were starving, we had asked for more bread twice before it finally appeared. 
- I had ordered two apps instead of a main. My soup came out and my tuna tartare did not appear until around the time when the burger appeared (which was much later than the other mains re: kitchen collision). This was strange because tuna tartare does not even require cooking- you just assemble raw tuna and avocado and place a few chips on a dish. Another diner's garlic bread with cheese appeared at this time as well. 
- I'm not positive if the other end of the table had major issues either but it seemed like everything was fine. 

The manager came up to us and explained that it was the end of the night and people wanted to go home, and food items were being placed out on the counter but were not being bused in a timely manner. She apologized profusely and took care of all of the items on our bill that got messed up/never came. We also spoke to our server about the salad that never came out and apparently she handed it off to a bus person to bring to us and I don't know how it never made it to us. 

I've never considered The Keg to be a favourite, and after this experience I certainly don't have a better opinion of it now."}
{"text":"Great happy hour and good service. My husband and I stopped in before a movie and our waitress was accommodating and got us our food and drinks very quickly. Nice ambiance too!"}
{"text":"First time at the Keg, my mom brought me here. I got the sirloin and lobster deal with a twice baked potato. Everything on my plate was sooooo good!!! Our server was also very friendly and attentive. Very nice restaurant and reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"Good meat, good wine, good service, take some good company, and goodnight!"}
{"text":"Do not order their Fried Chicken. It is terrible. Blackbird would have been better. Slow service. No utensils with the Crab Legs and took forever to get the check. Very disappointing as The Keg at Tempe Marketplace is outstanding. This one not up to their standards."}
{"text":"We came here with a large group and the service was outstanding.  They were all very accommodating and friendly.  The food was fantastic and very reasonably priced considering the larger portion sizes.  

I recommend ordering the entree's that come with salad and veggies.  They also come with an additional side dish.  

Our whole group raved about the food and everyone had different things: fish, meat, appetizers.  

What I like:
-The atmosphere is good, and you can make this a special occasion place or not
-The servers weren't annoyed by our larger group and need to split the bills
-The food was fantastic and it came quickly

What I'd do differently:
-Our GPS directions were wrong...not the restaurants' fault...I recommend calling ahead and asking for directions if you are from out of town.

Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Great food, and not over priced for what it is! 

If you love steak, this is a great place! I would rank them close to Flemings, Ruth's Chris, however, they are not nearly as expensive."}
{"text":"The Keg gets 5 Tickled Pink Stars!

This is absolutely one of my favorite restaurants!  The food, the ambiance and the service is what keeps me coming back.  It is a little more expensive, but I consider this place a treat!

My husband and I recently indulged ourselves for my birthday at the Desert Ridge location.  We usually visit The Keg at San Tan Marketplace, but have also been to the Chandler Fashion Square location.

Two of my must haves? Mushrooms Neptune and the Creme Brulee!  We've enjoyed a great steak before with an amazing flavor...cooked just right.  Every visit we've enjoyed either up at the bar or in a booth in the bar.  I'm still wondering what the restaurant looks like. LOL

We will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Wonderful steaks that just melt in your mouth. Service was great. This not a kid friendly place so make sure to leave them at home  =) . Got to say I will be returning again soon."}
{"text":"Living in Cave Creek - decided a steak at The keg was in order as decent steaks in Cave Creek are on the endangered species list and haven't been seen for a couple of years - sorry Harolds/Cartwrights etc, steaks are not your sweet spot..... 

Back to The Keg. The Brie appetizer was fabulous, the wine was just as good. 
Our waiter, Mat was on day 9 of his adventure and a little nervous but did well and will be a super star at Keg in a couple on months..
The entree, both steaks were mediocre, cooked the right amount but not the best cut of meat, the baked potato was over cooked and tasteless. (Papadeax (on I17) has the best baked pots 
The deserts were pretty average.
Overal its an OK place but with so many really good steakhouses close by, The Keg will need to step up its game if it is going to have a long term future at Desert Ridge."}
{"text":"We had Happy Hour at The Keg on a Monday night a couple of weeks back. Very elegant decor. Our waitress was very efficient and polite. The food was tasty and our cocktails well prepared. Amazing to see the number of employees that they have!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was good. I'd come back. The service was good, the Ambiance was great, the food was good. I had the New York strip steak. The key lime pie was okay.  There was a decent-sized wine list, we had the prisoner which was only priced at $60"}
{"text":"Restaurant absolutely PACKED! Only seating was patio or 90 min wait for a table inside. Opted for outside. Don't bother going if the restaurant is super busy. The steaks are precooked and put in a warming drawer. The prime rib looked like it was days old by the time I got it. Au jus was cold! Terrible food for the price. If you go in the off times, it's pretty good, but the kitchen can't seem to handle a busy restaurant and the food quality goes down the tube. We'll not be returning any time soon after the poor experience for the dinner."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants. The steak, sides, and drinks are so delicious every time. I've never had a bad waiter/waitress. We go for many of our families birthdays and anniversaries."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times in hopes of it being fantastic just one time. But honestly it never has. I tried 3 different steaks each time, their black tiger shrimp, their stuffed mushroom appetizer, their calamari, their goat cheese appetizer, and all were okay. Nothing to rave about. The best items out of all those listed were perhaps the calamari and the goat cheese. I have had WAY better steaks elsewhere. Not much flavor to them. For the prices I expected more. I probably won't be back. Service is great. But if you are looking for an awesome, melt in your mouth steak, this is not the place."}
{"text":"The BEST Steak I have ever had!!!!! My husband took me here for our 26th Anniversary and everyone there made us feel so welcome.. we were greeted and seated very quickly(make a reservation).. the servers were so amazing and they even signed and delivered us a card for our anniversary which I think goes above and beyond plus I had ordered a simple Diet Pepsi and my husbands shrimp appetizer came with a slice of lemon so I threw it in my soda.. the next round of drinks our server(I wish I could remember her name) saw that I had put lemon in my other soda and brought me the next one with lemon in it now that is an eye for detail an impeccable service.. okay about the food like I said it was amazing.. we both got their amazing deal of a 3 course meal.. for the first course I had a lovely Ceaser salad and my husband had the garlic shrimp.. for the second course we each got the 10oz bacon wrapped filet and the twice baked potato.. it came with some beautiful French green beans and peppers and a side of béarnaise sauce. The Steak just melted in your mouth and the potato was filled with the silkiest of fillings it was amazing and for the final course my husband had a mocha ice cream filled pie with chocolate cookie crust and covered in caramel with sliced almonds while I had the yummiest crème brûlée.. them one of the management team brought us two glasses of champagne to end the meal.. I honestly have to say it was the best meal and the best service ever had!!!"}
{"text":"I don't give five stars willy-nilly so the fact that this restaurant gets one should tell you a lot.

 The restaurant is clean well-kept with plenty of parking.  Right off the 202 and Williams Field Road so very easy to get to.  Plenty of outdoor seating with a misting system that makes outdoor dining very comfortable.  

The service was excellent.   The waitress and her trainee went out of their way to answer any questions about the menu.   Food presentation was excellent.  My filet was one of the best I've had in many years, flavorful and cooked to perfection.

The kitchen manager Jason made the rounds to check on everyone which I find refreshing and would encourage more upscale restaurants to do.

While some say this restaurant is on the pricey side I say you get what you pay for and it is well worth it here.

I highly recommend and will be back myself."}
{"text":"I normally write good reviews and skip anything negative but this place is ridiculous.  My husband & I went late Sunday afternoon and our bill was $150 !!!  We did not have an appetizer but did have two pieces of frozen grocery store key lime pie, two large glasses of wine, and two Keg Classic meals (salad & side of veggies included).  I had a choice on my filet to have a \"bleu cheese crust\" and it came TOPPED with a bleu cheese compote - no crust !!!  The topping was good but ...  The meat tasted fine and it was tender but no special flavor from grilling or broiling in butter or ... The side mushrooms, green beans & bread were fine.  My iceberg wedge salad was okay, there weren't hardly any tomatoes and the \"bleu cheese\" dressing was just watery stuff you could get at a fast food restaurant - meaning NO actual BLEU CHEESE in the dressing or on the salad !!!  My garlic mashed potatoes didn't have any garlic flavor or butter flavor or heavy cream or secret spices or anything to talk about.  My husband's caesar salad was fine, rice was basically packaged rice but the kicker was his prime rib.  He was told it was their specialty and smoked or marinated or something for 24 hours.  It was tiny and had fat all throughout (hardly any meat).  Yes, prime rib is fatty but that is the outside edge not 75% of the dish.  And he said it basically didn't have any flavor either.  I know this will sound low class but Longhorn's food (salads, bread, desserts, filets and especially prime ribs) are beyond EXCELLENT !!!  Every time !!  And for a fourth of the price.  Maybe it's just a trendy place or the \"ambiance\" or people think they have to spend tons of money to get quality food & service plus excellent flavors & large portions but we disagree.  Sorry !!!"}
{"text":"Very happy with our service and our meal.  Made our evening after going to a play at ASU.  It isn't inexpensive but then you usually get what you pay for.  I look forward to going back."}
{"text":"Airport steakhouse - and everything that connotes. Pricey menu, but I will say that the \"baseball\" top sirloin was tasty and pretty tender for the cut. Good size wedge salad, and the baked potato was tasty.

Service was a highlight for us - exceptional waitress. Drinks were well prepared, if a tad light on the poor. All in all, not a bad respite from a cold blustery nite within spitting distance of the airport hotel scene."}
{"text":"We've been here a couple of times but it's been years.  Got the keg steak and added king crab for $18.  The steak looked great, but the king crab was very disappointing.  Looked and tasted stale, and wasn't bigger than a snow crab cluster that you can get from your store - guess I was expecting a larger crab leg.  Got 4 small & thin pieces.

The steak had good flavor, seasoned well, but was a bit chewy, so probably a lower-end choice rib eye cut.  It was average.

Question is ultimately would we be back?  Provably not.  I can bbq a better steak or may go to a different steak house.  May explain why we haven't been back in years, but now I can lookup this yelp review and remember.  

Service and ambiance we're great."}
{"text":"Awesome awesome for happy hour, and good looking people after work :-) :-) And great for groups. Beyond that its an average steak joint."}
{"text":"Reasonable mid-range steakhouse. Food is good, but falls short of the most acclaimed steakhouses. Good value for what is served and a good quiet well appointed setting."}
{"text":"Celebrating my birthday at The Keg Steakhouse always look forward every year. The filet minion with Bernaise sauce excellent. Gary had steak & Lobster which was perfect."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere , bar area and patio are awesome! My fiancé got the prime rib and it was OK I got a burger and it was over done. But the service was great and atmosphere was great. I would go again and try something else."}
{"text":"SUPERB fillet, great wine selection for the wine snobs. Hubby and I went here to celebrate his new job about a month ago, and we have nothing but great things to say about The Keg! The service was great too!"}
{"text":"Very rarely do I give \"good reviews\" and I don't typically eat at the same place twice in a week.  Well, I'm doing both for the Keg.  Awesome food was enjoyed by all and the service was exceptional.  

When are they coming to Cleveland, Ohio??!"}
{"text":"Two of us went to The Keg tonight at Desert Ridge.  Our review is as follows:
Service was good. 
Wine selection is average.
We both got the filet dinner which comes with vegetables, sautéed mushrooms and a potato.
Vegetables:  Were mushy.
Sautéed Mushrooms:  were good and a generous portion but they are served on top of the sautéed veggies, therefore, all the flavors blended together.
Bread and Butter:  Nice - bread was warm
Baked Potato:  Was overcooked and not nice and fluffy (steamed).  It was if many had been made ahead of time and then served out so they sat in the oven until they were used.  Overall disappointment.  
Filet:  Bacon wrapped on the outside of the filet was not cooked with a nice crisp char on it.  The fat on the bacon was undercooked to the point where it was hard to cut.    Steaks were ordered medium but were served medium rare.  Steak had good flavor, not excellent rich meaty flavor, but enjoyable.
Noise Level:  Very noisy, we could not hear each other talking.  
Would we Return:  Probably Not"}
{"text":"Consistently one of the better Keg restaraunts I've been to. They cook the steaks just right, and the service is efficient. 

Sometimes can be difficult to get a seat (mostly due to location near hotels). Reservations are strongly recommended."}
{"text":"Used to be a great dependable places when they first opened but my experiences have been worse and worse over the last year. The prime rib is absolutely the worst. I've had comparable prime rib on board a navy ship. Overdone, grayish looking and pretty pricey.  Seems like there is always some mistake or slip every time we go. In all honesty I am rating them against comparably price establishments. If the keg were a lot cheaper I might give 3 or 4 stars. But cost and quality are not in line here."}
{"text":"Really a 4.5
My husband is Canadian and anytime we are anywhere near a Keg, you can count on the car veering off the road to get there!
I usually have the Ribs, which are surprisingly good (I don't know why I am always surprised, I just am), and he always has the Baseball Sirloin which he loves.  He will share one bite, and I have to agree....deeee-licious.
It is usually a diet splurge when we go, so he makes it worth the cheat and has his favorite - Billy Miner Pie for dessert.
The service at this location was excellent.  We could not have asked for a better waitstaff, they were very attentive and responsive.
Luckily, there is no Keg near our home!  (But don't ask my husband about that!)"}
{"text":"The prime rib was cold the mashed potatoes weren't what I ordered the bartender didn't know how to make a top-shelf margarita will not be coming back here"}
{"text":"outstanding service grate steaks but the crab isn't good  but it's a steak house so I forgive them for that but it's always a good exsperins and they have one of the best cream brulee"}
{"text":"My coworker really wanted some BBQ ribs, and I wanted steak, so \"The Keg\" filled both of our desires nicely.  The entrees are large and come with a choice of one side.  The salads are on only one size, but reasonable at $6ish, and you could share between two people.  I enjoyed the spinach salad quite a bit and would recommend it as a starter.  My coworkers shared a rack of Pork Ribs and enjoyed them.  Feeling in the cow mood, I really liked the filet medallions with 3 different sauces (creamy peppercorn, Chimichurri, and Béarnaise) and they served the sauces on the side :)

We were all full and had no room for dessert, although the creme brulee sounded awesome.  Although this place is called \"the keg\", there really wasn't a great beer menu.  But come here for the steaks, and enjoy some wine I say.  I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I  can't put my finger on it.  I didn't love it. They tried to sit us in the back room aka; cafeteria looking catering room. We asked to be moved into the main dining room, they sat us in front of this gorgeous floor to ceiling fireplace , that wasn't even turned on. It was our main focal point for the  evening and it was turned off. What is up with that ? The booths are so high you literally can't see anything around you. The carpet and fabric on the booths is very outdated.  We ordered a  7oz filet and a ribeye. they were really good, but the steak is served with a small miniature pitcher of bernaise sauce, and the ONLY side OF vegetable is a prepackaged, steamed mixture of carrots, green beans and broccoli, all of the other side option, twice baked potato, regular potato OR mashed potato, seemed very bland and blah, it reminded me of an old 1990's restaurant in a small town in the middle of Kansas.  The music took me straight back to high school, circa 1988.   The hostesses are dressed like Robert Palmer girls.  For almost a $200 dinner, I would go to Maestros in Scottsdale , or Roaring Fork or Red White and Brew over this place again. Oh! And they have icky awful Pepsi products.  Yuck, cheap.  I didn't like it at all.  The waitress was very nice and professional. She was very familiar with the menu and the selection of items. However, her dissertation of the menu was way too long, confusing, boring and I almost forgot everything she said because I fell asleep while she was talking.  I sat there and listened  to the waiter next to us with his new table, and he talked about the menu for 10 minutes it went on and on! It is a little MUCH, there was nothing on the menu worthy of that much hype. The bar is pretty much like a lizard lounge, and it was empty at 10pm on a Friday night. For the cost to dine here, I would pick another restaurant in this area before I would come back here again. The food/cost /atmosphere ratio just isn't worth it. I am a spoiled brat though when it comes to good food and atmosphere.  But for what we spent, we could have, should have, would have, gone to Mastros. I hate it when I waste money like that. Ughh.:)"}
{"text":"Ambiance was nice. Steak (pecan sirloin) was tasty. Waitresses were friendly. However was not overly impressed with restaurant. It was indistinguishable from other steakhouses."}
{"text":"We went out last night to the new Keg at Yonge and Sheppard and we were very impressed.  This is our favourite Keg location in Toronto now.  The ambiance is beautiful and very modern.  When we walked in, we were greeted by the hostess who smiled warmly and welcomed us and w were seated in a private booth. We made reservations and didn't have to wait. We had the calamari to start which was the best we ever had and it was served with two delicious sauces, We both had steaks and they did not disappoint.  They brought a complimentary dessert with a candle for our birthday celebration. The best part was our evening, was our amazing server. He made our night.  His name is Gaurav and we will be asking for him when we go to this Keg for our next special night out.  He was so kind and wonderful and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at the Keg here in Toronto. I am in town for a business trip and have been to many Kegs in the past. Typically I have come to expect an average dinner at this franchise, nothing special, nothing bad. I ended up coming to this location as our dinner party was pre-arranged by work. Now on to the good stuff...

This was one of the most AMAZING dinner experiences I have ever had. The service, from the moment we stepped in the door, to the moment we walked out with smiles on our faces, was second to none!

When we walked in we were greeted by very happy employees and then taken to our reserved area by a gentleman who gave us a tour to ensure we knew where everything was. When we sat down we were promptly greeted by our server. His name was Andrew and he was incredible. He had our table in tears from laughter throughout the night and when he would be tending other tables, people would be eagerly waiting for his return.

I ended up ordering the cheese toast, steak, roasted garlic mash potatoes, and then the cheesecake for dessert. All of the food was delicious, cooked to order, and came out in a very acceptable time. Andrew took his time with all of his tables and worked very well with the other server in our area. He even had his manager stop by to help on a payment mixup and apologize. 

From start to finish, I highly recommend dining at this specific Keg. It was a fun and satisfying experience. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Wow! I am a steak man, and I've been to some fine steakhouses. We chose The Keg because our daughter suggested it, but has never been here. I ordered a ribeye Chicago style (charred outside) med rare. Absolutely fantastic!! Done to perfection! Whoever is responsible for this bovine deserves a raise.
Not to mention the appetizers (calamari and bacon wrapped scallops) are very tasty. 
Our waiter Jeff was outstanding. Very helpful, accommodating, and a great personality (another raise management) This young man, when asked where the restroom was, didn't point, but actually escorted me. 
Kudos to The Keg and all responsible for such a fine establishment. Keep up the outstanding work, Godspeed!"}
{"text":"I love the Keg! Always have! Had my 46th birthday celebration dinner at this location. I have been three years in a row with the suggestion from a friend for this location, had the same experienced waitress and ultra kind lady who makes the dining experience perfect. The best gift is the amazing quality of the food. I know there is a recipe that all locations use, but this location nails it to perfection every time. I hope, as the years go in, the new ownership of The Keg locations do not change the perfect experience that this amazing location provides. Sad to say that newer locations, like the one that was built at Sherway Gardens, after moving it from The West Mall location, has lost its quality and care. The Sherway Gardens location has become a bad location so quickly to dine at. 
If you want a great experience, visit the Dixon Road one in this review. It's the way The Keg is supposed to be run. 
I have no other steak (pun intended) in this other than being a loyal customer for over 25 years now. The Leslie and 401 is a great location along with the fantastic Keg Mansion. 
Still this location in the airport strip is often overlooked. Love love love the food and service at this location so don't change and keep the fantastic staff happy."}
{"text":"We went to dinner in a Monday night.  We had a reservation, but were seated early.   The waitress came and took our drink order very promptly.   I ordered the steak and crab.  It came out absolutely perfectly.   We then ordered the brownie sundae and it was delicious.   Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food ...even better service
Had a 30 min wait, which was totally worth it.
Everyone there made our experience perfect!!
Hailey was our server and she was amazing! Can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"For the price the food should have been better.  Service was amazing.  The word \"bar\" in their name is deceiving. Only one dark beer on tap and, most of the beer selection on tap was terrible (cheap draft beer)."}
{"text":"Arrived at roughly 10:15 pm I know most places get annoyed when it's close to closing time and people walk in. My fiancé had just finished a performance and is leaving tomorrow for a couple weeks so I wanted to treat him. We sat in the bar area our server was so knowledgeable and so on top of her game it was truly a breathe of fresh air. Haven't had service like this is a very long time!"}
{"text":"Super great service and can't go wrong with keg!! Everything was cooked to perfection. Ambiance is nice. Great location. Fast and quick. 
I had the mushrooms and shrimp for appetizers and they were absolutely wonderful. 
I had my two kids with me whom they treated so well. I will defiantly be going back to this location!!"}
{"text":"I frequent the Keg often. The prices have gotten a little steep but the service and food is the best. Expect to spend $100 for drinks and dinner."}
{"text":"Hadn't been here in awhile I have to say I was a little disappointed. The service and ambiance had a lot to be desired. The food was good but not great. The company was wonderful. I probably won't be coming back anytime soon. There are so many really good restaurants to choose in the Valley."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I tried to book a 20 person event at this location in their private room. I was not allowed to talk to a manager at the 4pm opening time. Was hung up on and no one ever returned my call. They obviously don't need the business that bad. The Keg used to always be my go to for hosting client events but will now start seeking other venues."}
{"text":"I spent my Wednesday at the Keg. Yes, it is a franchise which I do not like, but other than that this place is nice and has a decent Happy Hour. 

The service is very nice, attentive and courteous. This is a very valued feature and they should take credit for this. Also, the wait staff looks great in a very tidy and appropriate fashion. The service is where this place wins me over. 

The Happy Hour food is price worthy - for a happy hour munch to side with your beverage it is very decent. The Happy Hour drinks include a Orange slice martini, yes it might not be the manliest of beverages.. but it is tasty, for sure. besides that they have some interesting beer as well. 

For our big group, this was a nice venue. The establishment had set aside a portion in the corner and that was perfect. We had great service, and at the same time we were left to our own devices and not hovered upon. Overall, a nice experience... did I mention the service?"}
{"text":"What goes better with steak than T&A? Horrible place to bring a date, even if she's a model, you'll still be caught with wandering eyes.

Oh, and the food is great too."}
{"text":"Good, very good meat nice place for a date.  The cut of meat is good, but bring extra money because you will pay it to eat this good grub."}
{"text":"Perfect place for a quality steak and pleasant atmosphere while on vacation. The staff, from the hostess to the servers, was amazing.  Our waitress was helpful and cheerful and took exceptional care of us without being intrusive. We all had the New York steak which was delicious. I recommend the Keg Classic dinners which essentially gives you a free salad. We felt welcome and pampered and left totally satisfied."}
{"text":"Bring some extra $$ & paying for the quality served here is totally worth it. Servers were excellent for our large party. Steak was on point, prime rib was cooked nicely. Creamed spinach was delicious as was the scallops platter. Kids menu available here with good offerings. Decent selection of beers on tap"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time on Sunday night, very very good food I had the steak and lobster.... Our waitress was outstanding (wish I remembered her name) I highly recommend The Keg! Great job guys"}
{"text":"I go there every time I am away on business in Mississauga and every time I have been very happy with everything.
The service is always fast and the staff is so friendly and professional. 
They always start you with their basket of fresh bread and it is to die for.
Amazing food but I find the quantity a little small for the price they charge but the food is good.
So far I had the steak, thai chicken, creole chicken and the salmon and I was happy with all 4 choices. Also the garlic mash is out of this world.
So if you are a meat lover this is the place to go"}
{"text":"Really like the Keg - it's one of those \"special occasion\" or not type of places and the food is consistently good.

I can never resist that warm sourdough bread that comes with whipped butter. I devour it in no time. I have had the steaks at the Keg before (can never go wrong), but I felt like having the Black Cod which never disappoints. The meat is cooked perfectly such that when you cut into the fish, you can see the juices running down. It is placed atop of a healthy quinoa salad and asparagus. Yum!

And now I know that the Keg has one of my face Pinot Noir's (the Meiomi) so quickly ordered that.

It was a birthday celebration so the waitress got us a cake (the Billy Milner or some name like that) which is really yummy.

All in all, great place to go. Fave location is still the Yorkmills and Leslie, but this one is not bad too. Not sure if this was always the case, but the Keg now takes online resos on Opentable, but up to 4 people. But at least they take reservations!!!"}
{"text":"A friend and I visited the Keg on 04/29/14.  The restaurant was moderately crowded and it has a full service bar.  We waited for a table for approximately 10 minutes, just enough time to receive our first drink from the bar.  We both ordered steaks. I had the NY strip, which is my favorite.  I know cuts of meat and how to prepare them, so I'm a little more critical of those who don't prepare them properly or know what the proper temperatures of steaks should be at rare, medium and well done.  I ordered mine medium and it was cooked EXACTLY like it should be.  Well done!!  The steak was quite large and flavorful, with very little fat.  Service was attentive, friendly and proper.  Four stars to The Keg!  I will return soon and I recommend that readers try this restaurant.  I had a very good experience.  One other point; the music in the restaurant was not turned up so loudly that we couldn't talk and hold a conversation.  I find so often when you turn a restaurant over to kids, they turn the volume up so loud you have to shout to your guest.  Not so here.  Again, very well done!"}
{"text":"AMAZING service. My filet was outstanding. My friend's was slightly overdone for her taste. We didn't complain, but the waitress overheard us talking about it and the manager came over and made my friend have a second one, mind you she was already 90% done with the first and would have been totally fine with it, but he insisted. It's pricey but you more than get what you pay for. (Full disclosure, I'm from New York and it seemed cheap to me, but I guess around here it was a lot) if I lived in Arizona, I would try to eat here once a week, but I would make sure I took a dump across the street at Ruby Tuesday. THAT place sucks and should be shut down."}
{"text":"had a couple of sides.... crab and mashed potatoes.  the crab was not sliced so you couldn't pick it or eat it easily but our server, austin, was gracious enough to do that for me after i asked.  my girlfriend had a steak which she loved it."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I came here to celebrate our six year anniversary - I knew it would be a great spot since I've eaten at another Keg location. 

Rundown of my experience:

We get to the table, our server greets us with a \"happy anniversary\" card signed by the entire staff. I think, woah! How cool!

We get our food (filets for both). They're perfect, I'm happy and full. We wait for the bill.

But wait, then another server comes from the kitchen and surprises us with a GIANT piece of what might be the most delicious cake ever, on the house, to further celebrate our anniversary. Blown away! I thought the card was a nice enough gesture. 

And then, the bill comes.

A final surprise - our meal is discounted, again, in honor of our anniversary. (For those wondering; the prices are beyond reasonable for the quality and size of the meal, even without the discount). 

I've never in my life been to an establishment that pulls out so many stops to make their guests experience memorable like this. I am SO blown away by their hospitality I can't even describe it. 

We'll definitely be back! I highly recommend this restaurant for any special occasion - they make you feel A list!"}
{"text":"Christmas Eve dinner.
First year without our daughter, so why not? (now a university kid who is at her mom's for the first half of the holiday, and we have moved into my wife's old condo until we find our forever home, but that's another story!).

We arrived 7:30ish and it there was a 45min wait for the dining room, so we grabbed a pair of seats at the bar.
It was a fun night. Chatted with the bar staff - very friendly, and funny.

We started with a bottle of wine and appys. The Brie was tasty as always, as was the French onion soup. 
Diner was a top sirloin and ribs.
The steak was excellent as always,  and is honest a big reason why the Keg is still going strong; they know steak. 
The ribs were ok. Never had them before from the Keg, so why not. They were ok. Tender, but no pop.

We ended up chatting with one of the managers a out great BBQ spots.

Then on to dessert and an espresso.

All in all, a great Christmas Eve with my spectacular wife. 

Happy Holidays!"}
{"text":"The Keg is awesome! Their happy hour is the best in town and their service is always A+. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The second time around was just as good. Went back with a larger group and were seated in the dining area (very \"cozy\", by the fireplace). Ordered a variety of drinks and wines which were all good and everyone's meats were prepared as ordered and melt-in-your-mouth delicious! I was a bit nervous about the person who ordered chicken, but they said it was really good too. The kid's meal came with a little \"appetizer\" tray of fruits, veggies and dip and crackers (nice touch!). Server was attentive, knowledgeable and friendly. The Keg did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Although I am limiting meat in my diet, I went to the Keg for a date.

I had only been one other time for drinks with a couple of friends and it was nothing worth writing home about really.

I think what I really loved this time was the salad.  Yeah, I know, a steak house and I'm blown away by a salad!!  It was the spinach salad with walnuts and cranberries.  It was soooo good.  

Of course my little girly sized fillet was incredible too.

Oh ... and the date ... yeah it was good too!! ;-P"}
{"text":"I've never left a bad review before but I was extremely disappointed in my experience in the bar of The Keg in Tempe Wednesday night. While I must say our server was fantastic, everything else was blah. 

I met some friends for drinks and appetizers. The first drink I had was the Orange Slice. I've had this in the past at a different Keg location and enjoyed it. But this time, I thought I could taste the chlorinated Phoenix water in the drink. I didn't say anything to our server but I decided to order a different drink the next round. My second drink was an Old Fashioned. This drink is made with bourbon, bitters, lemon, orange, sugar and soda. So I couldn't understand why it tasted extremely watered down. This time I said something to the server. I thought it might be the soda water that had ruined these drinks. She checked with the manager and then returned recommending I avoid a drink made with soda. The manager did not stop by. I sent the drink back and ordered a Manhattan. The Manhattan is described on the menu as being made with bourbon, vermouth, and \"house-made drunken Bing cherries\". Cherries. Plural. The drink arrived with a single MARASCHINO cherry. Not the house-made cherries I was expecting and looking forward to. This drink also tasted watered down, as if it sat in the mixer cup over ice much too long. My friend ordered a spiked tea. It, too, was extremely watered down! I blame the bartender for our disappointing experience. One of my friends had a steak and was quite pleased with her meal. In the future, IF I ever do return to this restaurant, I will only choose wine or beer because the bartender either does not know how to make cocktails, or she was skimping on listed ingredients to save the restaurant money."}
{"text":"Disappointing evening at the keg steakhouse. My salad was overloaded with dressing so it was limp and soggy but instead of replacing it I was told that's because it was a heavy dressing, what?! A little salad with some spring lettuce must cost them about $.50 if that and they charge eight dollars but they did not automatically replace it?  The prime ribs did not look very appetizing but tasted OK. Not once to the waitress come back to ask if we needed more water or a refill on a drink,But I still tipped her 20%, not sure why. Nice atmosphere but in my opinion quite overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"High quality steaks and seafood with excellent service. That equates to a fine dining experience to me.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Everything was great. Didn't care too much for the escargot, I like the more traditional with butter and garlic better. Prime rib was perfectly cooked. The outdoor ambiance was nice...not too loud. Servers were attentive and friendly. My wife's salmon was very good also"}
{"text":"Where to start? Not only were we surrounded by a baseball team of children with two oblivious adults letting them hover on all sides of our table, we were surrounded with yells and cleats. The menu prices were pretty high, but we agreed to give it a chance. Two New York  Manhattan cut steaks and a prime rib. Half of one of the NYs was over cooked on one side and rare on the other with giant lines of grizzle running through it. My NY came out with three, I repeat, three green beans and a piece of a red pepper for the side. The other two guys I was with had a large side of both, including mushrooms. (Where oh where was the rest of my dinner?) I don't know who grabbed the plates to run the food, but they forgot the rest of mine? All steaks were over cooked with one side somehow missing the grill completely. Luckily, after finding the manager, he compt my food which was inedible aside from the three green beans and discounted the other two entrees. Very pricey for the hockey pucks that they served us. Perhaps the chef was having an off night. The bread was about the only decent thing we ate. The server was kind but clearly busy babysitting."}
{"text":"Every time I come here, I can count on the best steak in tow. Even though it's pricey, I do get quality service and great food. Love this steakhouse!"}
{"text":"Excellent from beginning to end. Great service. Awesome French Onion Soup, Cesare Salad, Baked Brie. Even the Calamari was delightful--neither over-cooked or over-salted. Brandon was an amazing and attentive server. The prices were quite do-able for the quality. The steaks were perfectly prepared, and the side dishes done just as well. There was absolutely nothing bad that happened, only good! If you are a fan of French Onion Soup, you WILL NOT be disappointed! The Steak and Lobster came with 2 tails! Dessert was perfect as well. This was an amazing choice, and an absolute surprise for a chain restaurant in a mall!"}
{"text":"2 out of 4 people got seriously Ill after mothers day dinner. No compensation. Manager inferred  we must have eaten something else that day. No, no Dr Keg I did not.Not that I ever want to eat here again. Veggies hard as rocks. I don't know what you people are eating but this place stinks."}
{"text":"I went to this location during the opening week late last year with friends who work close by, and we had a great time. Food and service was fantastic and definitely met the Keg standard. Went again last night when I was in town for work and was extremely disappointed. The restaurant wasn't busy, but our waitress never seemed to be around the bar area to serve us or ask how our meal was. We had to ask two other waitresses to put our drink order in and at one point the bar manager (I believe) said she would speak to the waitress who was never again to be seen - nor was anyone else until the end of the night when a different waitress asked us if we needed anything else. We ordered one last round, which didn't show up. Instead someone else came over to ask if we needed our bills... I'm not in the area often, but definitely will not be going back to this location when I am..."}
{"text":"I came here with my fiance, just because we were craving steak, and our spot recently closed (Montis). It was a Friday evening and we were seated fairly quickly. We both ordered the Prime Rib, and it was amazing. Their mashed potatoes and mushrooms were amazing. We will most likely be back."}
{"text":"The keg is always good.  My only complaint was that the food is rushed out.  I had asked the waitress to hold off between the appetizer and the main course.  But I was not clear enough.  In the future I would ask them not to start cooking of the main course until I ask them to, to ensure I don't feel rushed to eat."}
{"text":"Visited 10/28/113.

I have been several times in the past. I have not had a bad meal or service at any time. 

Shared a dinner salad which was huge. One was enough for the two of us. I ordered the Baseball Sirloin which was cooked just perfect.  I also had the Clam Chowder.  I am not really a fan of corn in my Chowder, but this still was very good. 

Service was great.  We were able to sit outside as it was just cool enough. 

The price may be just slightly more than you might get at the next steakhouse that is a step down.  But lately, we have not been getting good steaks at the lower priced competitors.  For the money and quality, this a great place for a good steak."}
{"text":"this place has great customer service, the food was delicious it was well worth the price, over all i had a great experience.. i will definitely return for some more steak"}
{"text":"The keg did everything right. The food was predictably done correctly and presented beautifully. And it was delicious.
But the thing that made the biggest impression was when I made the reservation, they asked if there was a special occasion. I said yes it was my father's birthday. I assumed they would sing him a silly sing and clap blah blah blah... But to my surprise and my father's, there was a happy birthday card on the table and it was signed by the staff that worked that evening. Nice touch."}
{"text":"The filet mignon was pretty good.  Had the classic dish, which included 2 sides, a salad and a baked potato.  The bread was served hot and fresh.

I had 2 glasses of Arnold Palmer, each, which tasted totally different from one another.  

I was seated immediately, 0 wait time, granted it was a thursday night."}
{"text":"My husband and I just left this steakhouse and it was exceptional! The waiter was very professional and he was just a pleasure. My steak was very tasty but slightly under cooked so I asked our waiter to send it back to cook it a little more. He came back with it cooked to perfection and one of the managers can over to apologise. He also sent over an extra potato with my steak. It was a very nice gesture and I really appreciated that. Upon leaving they then sent over a delicious piece of cake on the house. This restaurant was a five star without a dought. We would highly recommend coming and checking it out for yourself. Exceptional!"}
{"text":"Filet mignon, medium at bar w/o Applewood bacon. Came as ordered via bartender Kyle. Awesome service, courteous and mindful. 
Steak was tender and service was prompt. Would recommend and return next time in Toronto."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. Too bad because the food is better than average.  The service and attention to detail is very lacking.  The little things that separate good from \"just OK\" are missing. Management has a wonderful opportunity to make this place so much better with just a little training and a conscious effort to raise their standards of service."}
{"text":"Being from the east coast and not a fan of chain restaurants, I must say I am a fan of this place.   While the service was spotty at best, our waitress vanished for a while, the food itself was very good.  I look forward to visiting the Keg the next time I am out west!"}
{"text":"Great service.
Excellent ceasar salad.
Blackened sirloin with twice baked potato is highly recommended.

Jlorhs cab very nice flavor."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour with coworkers. Awesome! The food was delectable and you get some homemade chips while you're waiting. I'm not sure if it's in the bar area only or everywhere, but nonetheless I will definitely be back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I was contacted by 2 managers regarding my poor experience and they were very concerned with making things right. I agreed to go in a second time and see how things went. I didn't ask to speak with Carlos, the Chandler manager, until after my husband and I were done eating so I could see how the experience was before they knew the complainer was in. I have to say it was a completely opposite experience than the last time! We were cheerfully greeted and seated as soon as we entered. Our server Maria was great! She acknowledged us right after we sat down and told us about the menu and took our drink orders. She answered all of our questions and made sure my water was always topped off. The food was excellent. Perfectly cooked and tasted so good. My husband and I were both very pleased that they took it above and beyond to make sure their customers are happy. We definitely left full and happy."}
{"text":"This location is absolutely top notch. We have visited here many times. This was the first time our steaks weren't cooked to order (both were overcooked). The manager took exceptional care of us, ordering the steaks be remade and then removing them from the bill. With two small kids in tow, it's wonderful to have this level of service and delicious food that al four of us love to eat! Happy hour in the bar is fun & fantastic, but dining room quiet + attention is great for date night. All-round a fabulous place for steak, salads and seafood."}
{"text":"Really average. I went their for someone's birthday dinner. Everyone kept talking up how special the place was and I was expecting a lot--especially for the price. My food was good. I had the spinach salad with grilled sirloin. The steak was pretty good and the salad was fresh and tasty. However, they didn't put cheese on my salad. They also forgot it on someone else's salad. The salad wasn't cheap enough for them to forget a major component such as goat cheese.

 My husband had the bleu cheese filet and really liked it. The white truffle macaroni was good but they used oil instead of shaved truffles. It was all good but should have been really special for the price. And--seriously--how can a place called \"The Keg\" have only five beers on tap; two of which are Blue Moon and Coors Light?

The service wasn't that great, either. We asked for steak sauce twice and were almost finished eating when it arrived. The waiters and staff did not step aside and let patrons by. Several times a waiter squeezed passed me brushing up against me. They can't say \"excuse me\" or slow down for a second? The place wasn't that busy. 

I won't go back. The food was good but I could get a much more special dining experience for the same price."}
{"text":"Bomb.com as usual...great service awesome steaks.  Thanks The Keg!!

Ps yelp sucks....my message is short so it's not a review???  FAIL yelp.  I'm uninstalling after this \"tip\"."}
{"text":"I called to place a to go order.  Someone from the restaurant picked up and hung up without attending the customer.  I called back and was informed that they do not accept take out orders.   Needless to say, they will never have my business.  Terrible customer service."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how it has worked out that even though I don't eat steak, The Keg is one of my favorite restaurants! The food and service has been spot on each of the times we have gone, it's amazing.

I've dined at this particular location a few times with groups between 2-6. Their staff is always friendly and efficient with getting additional bread, drink refills, etc.

My favorite dinner items are the Keg Cesar salad to start, the Pistachio Crusted Salmon entrée, and the Creme Brûlée for dessert. The Keg Cesar salad always seems to be fresh & crunchy. I love the Salmon dish because the fish has a delicious crust! It is served with creamy mashed potatoes & Brussels sprouts with bacon and is topped with maple butter. I seriously drool every time I start thinking about it! No meal is complete without dessert & what better than a creamy Creme Brûlée, right? The one here is perfectly decadent!

The others I've dined with have gotten the steak options & seemed to have really enjoyed them. Their main courses and sides are tasty & really filling. While not the cheap, I think The Keg is a pretty good deal!"}
{"text":"Great prices! The pistachio salmon was excellent! I especially enjoyed the maple glaze on it; takes away the fishy taste of it for anyone who prefers a full bodied flavor. The service was INCREDIBLE. We were celebrating our wedding (1 month anniversary) so the server comped our dessert. On our way out my husband forgot his hat. This is a hat I gifted him on our first Valentine's Day. We were all the way in the back of the parking lot as a server ran out to hand my husband his hat. I was astonished. He tipped him and I thank him as I was so happy to see such a nice act of service being done. What a guy! 5 starts. Will go back!"}
{"text":"WOW!  Best steak dinner so far in the valley!  The people that checked in with reservations had to wait so we grabbed a table in the bar. We happened to sit next to the kitchen manager & he approved of our choices....sirloin (6oz) & peppercorn Nee York!  Delicious!  Had the lobster appetizer hat was to die for & im not a big fan of lobster!  It was super busy but the staff was very attentive and we really appreciated the
Kitchen managers's input. We told them we were snowbirds for the first time & they were great about it!!  What was really nice is that they comped my drink & the appetizer!  That's just good business!!  We tipped the waitress the 20% + the comped items!  We were out for no special occasion but it would be a great place for a romantic dinner. The prices were very reasonable considering the quality of the food!  Double baked potato was great as was the wedge salad!  They have a nice patio also!  We will be back!!'"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Went in at 5:00 on a Wednesday for an early dinner. The place was not busy and we were told by the hostess that it would be just a few minutes because the servers were \"polishing the tables\". 20 minutes later, no one had come or gone, there were at least 5 employees milling around and we were still not seated. Had to walk out. Sitting in Firebirds as I write this."}
{"text":"I dined here with the family recently. One word, amazing.  

The service was impeccable, food was solid, ambiance was on point. 

I recommend this location to anyone looking for a good vibe, great bite, delicious cocktails, and TOP NOTCH service. 

Service, service, service.  A+"}
{"text":"Woowo! I love the Keg. I have been to the Tempe location and this time, we went to the Chandler location. I hope we have this restaurant in Chicago! The food is amazing as I expected and the service was even better. We had a business dinner, a party of 7. Our customers seem enjoying and our company members too!  We had calamari and fried cauliflower, and few of us ordered Keg classic, FILET MIGNON, medium rare and few ordered PRIME RIB, medium. Each steak was cooked perfectly and delicious! The wine was very good, we had the Prisoner."}
{"text":"Wow! I was impressed. I went there with my colleague. We ordered calamari and garlic shrimp as appetizer. I ordered top sirloin, medium rare and it was perfect! My colleague had rib eye and filet mignon. All food looked gorgeous.

The food: excellent
Service: excellent
Price: excellent
Ambiance: excellent"}
{"text":"Came here for restaurant week, they really had a nice selection for $30, had the wedge salad, the sirloin Oscar with a twice baked potato, and a fudge brownie for dessert. Waitress was awesome and food was good!"}
{"text":"I had been here before and remembered having a great time. I recently came I with my family for some wine and meal. 

We were greeted at the door but the girl seemed awkward, irritated and had a bit of an attitude. We simply asked if there were any seatings near the fireplaces and she said no and then waited for us to figure out where we'd sit. We weren't inform on where we CAN sit and given that she's a hostess, shouldn't she be helping out a little? hmm

She wasn't helpful so we sat at the bar area. We had a lady grab our drink orders and then never came back to take our food orders. I mean we sat there for half an hour and we didn't get all our drinks or food ordered. We moved to the lounge area and got a new server and he was very informative, prompt, and on point. I believe his name was Bill! Awesome guy and gives great service. He definitely knows customer service. We were pleased with his attentiveness and how helpful he was. 

When we got our food, we were excited considering it took about an hour and a half till everything was situated. Everybody did not enjoy their food because it was either overcooked, incredibly dry, or flavorless. I lucked out and fortunately had ordered a dish that was excellent. Their twice baked potato is delicious and the baked brie is even better! 

I also want to note this was on New years day and the restaurant wasn't busy at all. There were all but 5 other groups there when we were during dinner time. We were hoping for a nice new years dinner but it was the opposite as far as my groups experience."}
{"text":"The wife & I have eaten @ this location several times. Their burgers are really good, have a full bodied steakhouse flavor. The iceberg lettuce salad is 1/4 head of lettuce with dressing...kinda hokey if you ask me, but other restaurants are doing the same, so I guess it's just me."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with the Keg. I wasn't expecting too much from the outside. Looks nice - stone building. Location is right next to the mall.

Once inside.. whoa! I can't see anything! It is so dark inside it's really tough to see the person across from you. At least in the lounge area. I was here around 5:30pm, and it was still very light outside, and extremely dark inside. The service in the lounge area was ok - a little slow. 

Dinner service - was better than the lounge. However, I sat at a table with 7 other people and they brought 4 pieces of bread. We had to ask for more, which  seemed to frazzle the waiter a little. Serving the food was a little jumbled - one of these \"raise your hand if you ordered the Caesar salad\" type of things. 

Overall, the Caesar salad was good, my sirloin steak was good - a little over-done for medium, but still good. I was pleasantly surprised.With a name like \"The Keg\" I really thought this was going to be a divey-beer joint - which it definitely is not."}
{"text":"This is my first review of the year. And rightfully so. Coming here literally prompted me to write a review...immediately...as I was eating! 

I've been to a couple of keg locations in the past. And both have garnered less than stellar experiences. I would have never thought to even come back to another Keg except when this location opened on Yonge, and lured me in with the modern woodsy decor. 

I'm so glad I did. We ordered the mushroom Neptune's as an app, the Chicago top sirloin medium rare and the baseball sirloin medium rare with Cajun shrimp.

Everything was excellent!!! 

Our waitress Victoria was very friendly, energetic and courteous. 

The mushrooms Neptune's were melt in my mouth goodness, the bread just got out of the oven and was a very welcome accompaniment for the cream cheese on the mushrooms.

The Chicago had a nice char to it and had a real nice flavor. The meat was bouncy and almost tasted like sashimi. 

The baseball was a bit more on the rare side but the flavour and tenderness well made up for it. 

And the Cajun shrimp were huge and plump. The salsa medley on top was a fresh addition to a very meat heavy dish. 

This location totally knocked it out of the park and the Keg it seems has now finally won my loyalty."}
{"text":"Okay in town for a tradeshow and last night was so good we had a come back for a second night!

Amazing service again. This time we ate in the bar area next to the fireplace. Chad the bar manager came over and hooked us up with some dessert and Erica our waitress was stellar! Can't wait to come back next year."}
{"text":"I love restaurant week! A bunch of friends and I decided to get together for our birthday month (May!) This was a perfect place to do so! The service was good, the restaurant itself is par for the course as this is a chain restaurant (it is clean and low lighting as a steakhouse should be.) As for the meal......

I did the \"Phoenix Restaurant Week Special\" which was a three course meal for $30. (Steal of a deal!) 

First Course: Wedge salad - lettuce wedge topped with bacon, tomatoes and ranch dressing. (fresh veggies and creamy dressing = a delectable salad.) 

Second Course: The Keg Oscar - 8oz sirloin steak topped with shrimp, scallops, asparagus and Bearnaise sauce. (steak was perfectly cooked, the Bearnaise sauce with shrimp and scallops was okay. I would have preferred crab instead of shrimp & scallops but that's just me.) The entree came with a \"side\" which i picked the Twice Baked Potato, it was creamy mashed potato stuffed back into a half shell and baked again which quite delicious!

Third Course: Butter Tart -  Meh, not my favorite dessert but I like that the portion was small and that I was able to try something new i typically wouldn't order. It just didn't have a whole lot of flavor happening, just a boring sweet treat. 

On other visits to The Keg I have had:
* Mushrooms Neptune (mushrooms topped with crab and cream cheese.) a fav of mine!
* Keg Caesar - typical romaine salad with the Keg's version of dressing (good but go with the wedge if you are going to get a salad here.) 
* Filet Classic - filet steak wrapped in bacon
* Prime Rib - pretty self-explanatory  
* King Crab - a pound of steamed king crab legs. (So good & one of my fav's!)

This place can get a little spendy if your not careful. You may want to check out their happy hour menu (4pm to 7pm: M-F) you can try the Mushrooms Neptune for $4, the  loaded nachos for $6 and the Prime Rib Sliders for $8."}
{"text":"I've eaten here for lunch several times and I tend to leave decidedly unimpressed.  Nothing is actively bad (except, perhaps, the service on our last visit) but nothing is good, either.  I need to just stare down my co-workers and start straight drinking when we come here.  Or maybe just suggest some other restaurant some time..."}
{"text":"I just saw JN J.'s review of The Keg. I was in the bar the night he is writing about and the employees handled his tantrum beautifully. He was mad because he wanted his underage son to be allowed to sit at the bar top. From what I could tell he was told it was against company policy by the bartender in a polite tone, he didn't like that and demanded to speak with a manager who told him the same thing. He then proceeded to get loud enough that two other employees came over with the manager who had to ask him to leave. In my experience all employees at The Keg are always professional and courteous. We were thankful that they asked him to leave so the rest of us could enjoy our meal in peace. Thank you Keg, keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I don't even have words for how amazing the food is here... like seriously... one of the best meals I've ever had!
The New York steak was incredible and the mashed potatoes were amazing.
My husband had the prime rib sliders with roasted Brussel sprouts..  the prime rib in the sliders was the most tender, juicy, scrumptious slices of meat ever. 
Everything was great.. service was excellent!
And it was our anniversary, so they brought us mocha pie ... yumm!"}
{"text":"2 Part Review for 2 separate visits:

1).  On 11/9, Wonderful service by Greg tonight!!  The best we have had here!!   

As always Amazing rib eye & Caesar salad!  THE BEST mud pie!!!

2).  On 11/21, Very disappointing service for my birthday dinner with 14 people:-(

Our waiter, Dane, has short & know-it-all, snippy attitude.  It wasn't just a bad day -- he was the same a few months ago at dinner with my family.  We eat meals out A LOT, and I'm surprised he has a job at a nicer restaurant.  I know this isn't Ruth's Chris, but come on...!!

DO NOT GET DANE AS YOUR WAITER!!!

He never offered dessert and just brought the check.  He never even said Happy Birthday.  I only had 2 drinks, and had to ask 3 times for my 2nd drink.  

We were a larger party, so it wasn't a quick dinner.  After feeling rushed to leave and not asking if we wanted to order more drinks or dessert, we couldn't find him anywhere to take a pic of our group."}
{"text":"The Keg at Desert Ridge is one of my all time favorite restaurants! I have been dining there for 10 years and have never had a bad experience. We always get great service, excellent food, and a perfect atmosphere. I appreciate that The Keg serves great food that doesn't break the bank. Most recently, we visited The Keg for Father's Day and enjoyed a special menu for the holiday. In addition, all dad's got a promotional gift card for their next visit which made it an even better deal. Whether you're celebrating a birthday, anniversary, or just dinner, I would highly recommend The Keg and specifically this location. I'll continue to be a loyal customer!"}
{"text":"mmmm, Canadian comfort food!

We're huge Keg fans, and when we moved from Canada to Tempe earlier this month we had to take the kids to the Keg.  I love how consistent they are with the quality of service and the extras for the kids.  The service is a little lacking compared to most Canadian Kegs I've been to, simply because the staff seemed so much younger and less professional, but it was still really good.  The food quality was excellent, but the portions are very Canadian (read: smaller than US portions) while the prices are still what you would expect from Vancouver yet in an area where the cost of living is about 1/3rd.  For the money, I'd probably rather hit Ruths Chris..minus the kids :)"}
{"text":"Cocktails are too sweet. Kitchen had trouble with timing the dishes to arrive at the table for all guest. One of the meals arrived after everyone else was done. The manager did comp that meal."}
{"text":"I will have to admit that I was not a huge fan of the Keg, as I have been to the Chandler Mall location and I was not impressed. I was hesitant to try the new location at the San Tan Mall, but I tried it anyway. I have been there 3 times in the last 3 months, and I am glad that I did.

I thought the waitstaff was excellent and very helpful every time I went there, and their menu has some really great choices. The bar was very nice and clean and the outside patio is pretty awesome. If you go during the cooler months, they have a nice fireplace and comfortable seating. The prices are similar to Outback, but the food is far better.

I will be returning."}
{"text":"The Keg to me is the middle ground when it comes to steaks. They are less expensive than Durant's/Fleming's but more expensive than Outback/Texas Roadhouse. Likewise their steaks are less tasty than Durant's/Fleming's but more expensive than Outback/Texas Roadhouse.

With that said, each of the aforementioned places has their positives and negatives. Durants is really pricey but they very well may have the best steak in town to go along with their interesting atmosphere. You can cowboy it up at Texas Roadhouse where throwing peanut shells on the floor is allowed/encouraged. Fleming's is that classy place where you have a whole slew of wines to chose from to have with your supper.

So to take it all in and get the happy medium I think that is The Keg. The steaks are really good there. I would put them on par with Fleming's but obviously not as expensive. Neither myself or the girlfriend has had a complaint about the steak there. The price isn't too hateful there either. And the atmosphere can be as good or better than Fleming's depending where you are. The only thing Fleming's is going to have over the Keg in service is that at the Keg you will have one server that handles everything. Versus Fleming's where you very well may have three servers - one for drinks, one for orders, and one for food (you may not, but I've had special people come and only pour wine, etc). Fleming's isn't quite at the Delmonico's level (Vegas) as far as service.

Really, for the money I think the Keg is the best. Food is great as is service. If you sign up with them then you get deals on occasion (like your birthday, free meal)."}
{"text":"Amazing food and even better service. Alexis is the best waitress I've ever had and during our meal Shane the manager came over and made the night that much more special. The entire staff puts on an incredible performance and the steak was made to perfection. Warning..... the carrot cake is to die for and you will want it every night! The entire experience was one of the best nights we've had out! Great job Keg owners for hiring such and incredible staff!!!!"}
{"text":"So one of our vendors takes us out to happy hour here every so many months. On their dime so very few of my coworkers are no-shows when this takes place. We pretty much always get just appetizers and drinks. Best appetizers IMHO here are the Shrimp Cocktail, Baked Garlic Shrimp, Scallops & Bacon, Prime Rib Sliders, Crab Cakes, and Loaded Nachos. I've also had the filet mignon here a few times when we actually did dinner instead. Cocktails, appetizers, get lit and all on some 3 letter Fortune 200 company's expense account so what's not to like? Makes me slightly biased as I might be a lot more critical if I was shelling out the Benjamins. Service is always good though. Can't complain there. Bathroom's classy. Plenty parking since it's in one of those malls on Chandler Blvd on the outer northern rim of Chandler Fashion Center."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this restaurant, I have heard good reviews about it do I decided it go to check it out. The environment was cozy, the servers were friendly and on top of things. The food was delicious, however I felt like it was overpriced. For instance, I ordered crab cakes it was delicious; however it was $13 for two small crab cakes; I was disappointed. Secondly, I got the blue cheese steak or something for my main meal and it was delicious; however the presentation looked like they just threw it on the plate."}
{"text":"It's a bit pricey, but the patio and the bar are both good environments. The filet is probably the best thing on the menu. I like sitting in the lounge of the bar.. Nice comfortable seats and the dining area seems sterile to me."}
{"text":"Great food but service was a little slow, seemed under staffed. Overall very reasonable for the quality and quantity"}
{"text":"This place has one of the best HH's around.  The beers are fairly cheap in price and you get a lot of beer.  

The tempura snap peas and asparagus are amazing.  The steaks are also good.  I will definitely be enjoying a free sirloin on my bday.  So join the bday club here.

The chocolate martini's are amazing as well (so says my gf).  They're clear and you can't even taste the liquor, just chocolate.  It's not on their list of martini's but order it and you will have a great chocolate fix as well as get drunk."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Crab cakes were delicious. Both steaks were great, good portions. Twice baked potato was yummy but didn't live up to the hype. Went for a birthday and they brought a complimentary ice cream cake slice of some sort. It was excellent and no singing which made it an even better experience. 
We will go back!"}
{"text":"I like this place for happy hour. Great service, great atmosphere. The Mushrooms Neptune and Bourbon Cherry Smash were sooo yummy. I want to come back and try a steak sometime."}
{"text":"If you want to be ripped off, this is a great place to go.  I mean, where else can you get such small portions at a huge price?  Yes, my experience at the Keg was not that great.  Also, there was no KEG there that was serving good beer.  Of course unless you choose to buy an expensive bottle of beer.  The appetizers are expensive and the crowd is always irritating here.  I ordered a steak here medium rare and they accidently OVERCOOKED IT!  I asked if they would give me a new steak and they LAUGHED at me and made me eat the well done steak.  Needless to say, NO TIP!!"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and skip this place. I had never been here before, but it was close to where our friends lived and we invited them to dinner. I asked the waiter for his recommendation and he said The Keg was noted for its great prime rib. I asked if it was really, really tender. He assured me it was. I ordered it medium, pink with a warm center. When the prime rib arrived I could not believe my eyes. It was an awful grey color. I took one bite and could not eat any more. The flavorless meat was so tough that it hurt my teeth. The waiter took it away. I ordered pork ribs which was so-so. At the end of my meal the waiter brought me a much appreciated finger bowl. He forgot to mention that the water in the finger bowl was boiling hot. I got a blister on my right hand when I dipped it in the bowl. It took 5 minutes to get the waiter's attention. When I told him about the temperature of the water he said, \"Yeah we serve it hot.\" Unbelievable. Our dinner with our friends was a total disaster. I refuse to pay good money for mediocrity.
Edit"}
{"text":"So all I have to say is get the creme brûlée! I will often go somewhere else for dinner and finish here with a glass of wine and the creme brûlée. It's made in house and so yummy get it!"}
{"text":"The bar area is excellent for groups of people or for a single person to sit at the bar, have great food and drinks."}
{"text":"All our food got messed up. Over cooked scallops, rare steak. Horrible waitress. Jessica wasn't that accommodating. Never asked us once if we need everything. I asked for a medium plus she said they can't do it. 2 weeks ago we were just here and they were able to do it. So bad compared to the last time we were here."}
{"text":"Had myself a new york striploin and it was quite good although I do hate paying these kind of prices for steak.  I really thought the vegetables were more special than the steak, but if you compare what kind of quality steak you get here compared to say Donovan's (high quality steakhouse in CA), I've got to say that I like the overall package presented at Keg Steakhouse with respect to the quality and price."}
{"text":"This review is for a visit the evening of 12/17/2015:

We were celebrating my dad's birthday and as he is part of their email/rewards club, they send him a $25 off coupon email to be used around his birthday.  

I'll start by saying that we had to ask for bread for the table.  Bad start.

The portions that my girlfriend received with the bacon wrapped chicken were pretty small for what you pay, and the \"side\" of pureed asparagus was served in the same size container as my steak sauce.  (Also pureed asparagus doesn't look all that appealing which isn't really the Keg's fault but maybe leave it in spear form)

Then once we had ordered, and mind you it was only a party of 4, it took quite a long time to get our food.

Quite frankly all of the missteps and waiting that we dealt with up to the point of getting the bill were something that I could chalk up to being a busy night in a restaurant.

Here's where things turned into a complete cluster.  We were asked to forward the email my dad received to the restaurants email.  This seemed a little weird to me but we did it and there was no issue, it was applied.

Then when the bill came, I let the server (Gavin) know that we wanted to split it up and he replied that we could split it up however we wanted to.  I then proceeded to give the server a gift card, and the bill with three cards and itemized what should be charged to each card.  Server took these and went to take care of it.  

Shortly after he returned and notified me that he would have to apply the gift card to the overall bill.  I acknowledged this and he went back to take care of the bill.  He returned a third time to inform me that he could not in fact split the bill in any manner we'd like but could only split it up evenly AFTER one persons gift card was already applied. 

I find it tough to swallow that an establishment of fine dining doesn't have a computer system that is able to run a bill that can itemize what each patron had and bill separately and accordingly.

Then when the receipts were brought out it was realized that even though the server was given three credit cards, he only ran two of them, one of them, he ran TWICE. 

I understand being busy during the holidays and i understand if there is someone who is new to the job.  But giving information to a patron that is wrong after partially completing the transaction and not really having any type of explanation as to why they weren't able to complete things they way they stated they would be.

Just a very disappointing visit and lackluster serving from the Keg at Desert Ridge."}
{"text":"What's not to like?
Friendly hostess.
Beautiful interior with carpets and a lot of wood - keeps the noise level down.
Attentive and helpful server.
Nice selection of appetizers, main courses and desserts on the menu.
Fair price for what you get (if you're looking for a cheap steak dinner - look elsewhere).

I've been here a number of times. We each had a glass of wine.  I had the NY Strip and my wife had the Prime Rib on our last visit. Delicious and cooked to perfection.  We shared a Billy Miner Pie for dessert.  Before tip - about $85. Not bad.

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday dinner a couple months ago and thought it was great.  (If you sign up for their email alerts, they will send you a free $25 birthday dinner coupon).  I had the Prime Rib and Mashed Potatoes on the side.  I'm usually not a steak fan, however, this Prime Rib was wonderful.  The mashed potatoes were seasoned perfectly, too.  When we got to the table, there was a Happy Birthday card waiting for me-- very nice touch.  Also, the waiter was very helpful and nice, and service was quick."}
{"text":"Keg is a nice place to have a good steak.  Not the best steak ever but pretty dang good.  I had the prime rib with my birthday coupon. :). So I really can't complain about a free meal.  Service was excellent."}
{"text":"I went here Friday night for happy hour. I say at the bar with my friend and the bartender was extremely rude. I shouldn't have sat at the bar bc walking up to it I could feel so much negative energy from her. No smile, no friendly service , just a cold uninviting personality. We were in a rush bc we still needed to get ready for the night but needed to eat. The drinks were normal, but the food wasn't terrible and wasn't good either. It was just food, but I live to eat, and this was eat to live food. The sliders on the happy hour special had an akward taste.. The chopped salad was the best thing, bc the earth did all the work. My French onion soup was definitly too hot to eat for 30 min, and it wasn't in my top 20.. The lobster appetizer was bar far the worst thing we had and the crab cakes were mostly filler and mushy with a tangy flavor.. Nothing memorable here.."}
{"text":"Went to The Keg with 9 other guys. All of us thought it was pretty good. I was especially impressed with the service. Despite not having a reservation, we were quickly seated, had a nice table, and felt very welcome. 

The place looks pretty awesome. It looks like a nice mountain resort inside. Despite it being quite large and open, tables are laid out in a manner to provide some privacy. The restaurant is well lit and really seems well suited to large groups and friendly gatherings. 

I ordered the small prime rib and a cesear salad. The salad was standard fare, nothing too exciting. The prime rib was cooked to order and was well seasoned, tender, and very flavorful. The Au Jus was a tad bit salty for my taste though. (the saltiness seemed to be a common theme amongst my tablemates).  Beer selection was a bit sparse, for my tastes, didn't look at the wine list. 

The service was quite good. The wait staff was very friendly, knew their menu, made excellent suggestions, and accommodated our \"payment requirements\" graciously.  

Overall - food is good. I think the hit the level that they should be at. Service is great. Place looks pretty nice."}
{"text":"This restaurant nails it.  Technically speaking, the steak cuts get a b+, seasoning b+, cooking a- .  The service was b+ 

However when you factor in the reasonable price (~27 per full steak entree including salad and fixins) and great atmosphere, it rounds a complete and excellent experience.  Even though the service was imperfect, it was mainly because our waiter was overzealous to do a good job.  Hard to hold that against him.  Fantastic value - highly recommended, do not hesitate to come here."}
{"text":"Went to drink a few glasses of wine on a Saturday night. The Keg has a huge bar with lots of seating. They have a great happy hour with lots of special of food and drink specials. The best place to sit is by the fire but if that's taken snag a seat at the bar and watch a well oiled machine in process. There were 4 bartenders working, the head bartender Bryce was pushing quality drinks out in record time with a team of 4 other guys working smoothly and swiftly."}
{"text":"Last time!  I am a steak snob!  The Sirloin is horrible, like chewing on a dog treat!  Other steaks at the table had to be sent back, cooking temps all over the place! I will not go back to spend $160 on steaks I can cook and season ten times better for around $50. Just not worth the time to drive there and back."}
{"text":"We showed up early to avoid crowds here for our anniversary. Excellent service, Excellent atmosphere - I should have ordered the steak (of course) will do this for sure next time."}
{"text":"Came in for birthday dinner. We were sat right away. Christian was our server. Drink order was taken right away and a yummy sourdough bread to start. We order salmon dinner and the steak with lobster tail. Food came out fast and hot, also tasted great. Don't forget to sign up online for birthday promo."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place better because the concept is good: upscale ambiance, attentive service and steak oriented menu but I just couldn't get over the fact that my steak was mediocre at best.

Maybe it was just that particular NY Strip cut, because the prime rib in the sirloin steak the other members of my party had were a bit better.

The steakhouse fries were just out fridge and the bread was very dry and brought to us without butter. The garlic mashed potatoes were good but the company and vegetables were rather dry and unseasoned. The iceberg wedge salad was very good although maybe a few too many tomatoes.

Overall I was hoping for something better and think I could've either gotten Outback on the casual side, or just taken the next step and then Ruth's Chris and got something superior."}
{"text":"Ok so where do I start. I come here every year because of Spring Training. I always come out with my wife but this year we brought the kids. 6 year old and 1 year old. We were seated timely but it all went bad after that. The restaurant was empty and my daughter had just purchased a toy.  As she was playing with it while we were waiting for our food, the manager comes up to our table and asks us to have our daughter stop playing with her toy because it was making noise.  Keep in mind, the restaurant was empty and not many customers.  It was a Monday night for crying out loud. This has turned me off to The Keg and they have a lost a valued customer based on the manager's lack of tact.  Every year for Spring Training, I will now have to look for other options."}
{"text":"We stopped in at the Keg for dinner and had a splendid time.

Service was prompt and efficient.

The food was splendidly done.   

We had the goat cheese appetizer and were very pleased with the baked cheese flavors.

 The salad's greens were crisp and not overly covered in dressing.

The vegetables were crisp and not overcooked.   

I ordered a rare filet.  It was a wonderfully done rare when it arrived.  The only thing that could have made it better was more blood.  

My spouse ordered the filet and crab. Each was done perfectly.

The big surprise was the coffee was as good the creme brulee (not so last time).

I highly recommend the Keg as an alternative to more pricey alternatives (Ruth's Chris and Morton's)."}
{"text":"I had dinner here with my family last Tuesday evening.  We arrived at 7pm without reservations (they say they only accept \"call aheads\"), and were asked to wait in the bar area until they had a table available.

We waited approx. 10 minutes at the bar, but had a nice time and good cocktails.  Interestingly, after we were seated, my family and I all commented on the fact that there were at least 10 open, clean tables in the restaurant.  Funny, right?

Our server, Dominic, provided us with some of the best service I've ever received anywhere.  Next time you visit The Keg at Tempe Marketplace, ask for him.  I know I will.  My wife and I started with a house salad, which they split for us - a nice touch, along with the bacon-wrapped scallops and sweet hot calamari, which the table shared.  It was all delicious, prepared just right.  For our entrees, my wife had the grilled top sirloin, while I had the prime rib.  Both were amazing, prepared just as we requested!

During the meal, my wife and I each had a glass of the Pazzo Sangiovese/Cabernet blend.  We both thought it was outstanding - featuring the best attributes of each varietal."}
{"text":"Went last night for my wife's birthday.  We are on their birthday mailer but didnt get a certificate this month.  We were able to retrieve a voucher from the website.  Their website could be a bit more intuitive, but not the fault of this restaurant.

My wife had the bone-in ribeye and lobster.  Everything was cooked perfect and the service was excellent.  Our server John was was very nice."}
{"text":"We read all of the Yelp reviews, and also received good recommendations from friends for The Keg. The week before we  had dinner at Mastros and Modern Steak, both of which were amazing. The Keg...terrible. I had the BBQ chicken & ribs. They were very very dry and when they came out it looked like they had been sitting under a heat lamp for 20 minutes. The ribs were super tough and hard to get off the bone. Taste was awful. My girlfriend had their filet on the special menu. She managed a steak restaurant so she definitely knows how to order...so she requested medium rare \"plus\" (between medium rare & medium). The waiter said they had an \"alarming\" amount of people send their steak back when ordering something special like a plus, so he encouraged her to go with medium rare. The only thing alarming was how undercooked the steak was. Beyond rare. Cold in the center, not even a little bit close to medium rare. The steak didn't have very good taste at all. The best thing we had was the twice baked potato. Also, it's funny that they call this restaurant The Keg and they only have like 6 beers on tap, no microbrews or interesting beers.
In summary, if you are looking to have a really nice dinner and spend $20-35 per plate, I think there are MUCH better restaurants (Modern Steak was great...and can't compare it to Mastros since that's in a league of their own). Hope this is helpful..."}
{"text":"Went to celebrate our anniversary. We've been there several time and always good but last night, not great!  Server was very nice but got my order wrong and I didn't realize it until I was eating. I mentioned it to him and he said, sorry. ( how about offering to take it back or off the bill?) Steak very tough. I can make filet better at home.  Offered us champagne for our anniversary but just started pouring instead of asking if maybe we'd like a dessert instead."}
{"text":"**Original review from 6/1/2011. Updating new profile.**

I'm not a red meat eater, but my best friend was in town and was craving a steak. I had no idea where to take her. Another friend suggested this place because it was close and she had only been here for drinks. We decided to be adventurous and give it a shot. The friend who suggested the place decided to meet us.

We were seated immediately and although I was a little disappointed that we were seated in the hallway, next to the kitchen door and across from two other tables that we had to face because our table was horseshoe shaped, the seats were far back enough that the kitchen door didn't bother me. I was still a little conscientious of the other two tables with people staring at us though. Strike one.... horrible table.  Get it out of there.

Strike one was redeemed with a fabulous waiter. He was attentive, and we never had empty glasses or plates once we ordered. We received bread, appetizers, salads, entrees and refills with no hitch. 

I wasn't impressed with the appetizer, but it wasn't their fault. I just can't see myself ever having shrimp with cheese ever again. I thought it was weird when I ordered it, but was curious. Curiosity satisfied.

We received our salads and entrees and dug in. My friend's steak was cooked to her liking and loved her seafood with it. She said everything was what she was craving and expecting. Coming from her, that's a huge complement. My other friend was equally happy with her slab of meat.

My entree was the chicken oscar, which has shrimp and scallops on top in a Bearnaise sauce. Took one bite of the scallops and shrimp.... oh my. Yummmmm. Scallops were cooked perfectly. I love scallops that melt in your mouth. The vegetables were cooked perfectly. Still crispy, not over-cooked. Then I get to the chicken and this is where strike two happens. The chicken was so salty that I couldn't even finish the second bite. Luckily, I was full from the veggies, scallops and shrimp and mashed potatoes I ate. When the waiter asked if he could take my plate and I said yes, he asked if there was something wrong with the chicken. So, being honest, I told him. At this point, I'm full, fat, dumb and happy so I declined his offer to replace it with something else. 

Then here's where they redeemed themselves on strike two. Even though I told him it was unnecessary, the manager came over and apologized to all three of us. He looked at me and said he comped my salad and entree and then offered all three of us desserts and coffees on the house. He explained the saltiness comes from the rub the cooks use and he's asked them before not to use so much. I barely heard this because I was still astounded that not only is my entire meal free, but now desserts for all three of us too? And coffee? Who am I to turn down free coffee???

Then the manager asked me something I love to hear: Do you have any allergies? WHY YES I DO! NUTS!  He explained that I should not get these certain desserts and offered me all the nut free options. I asked him if I could marry him. It's been too long since someone in a restaurant asked me this before I could say something.

I would go back for another dinner. I know how to modify my meal to my satisfaction now. I would also recommend this place to my friends and family."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner before a show to have a decent dinner and while eating our bread they offer at the table half way through eating it I noticed the bread had mold through out the middle. I was concerned a little that I already consumed half but let our waiter know and the manager came by and told us this was the second time today that had happened. I voiced my concern and was expecting maybe a little something like a round of drinks, or a discounted tab for eating rotten food but nothing at all it was just blamed in the bakery it came from. I do not anticipate coming back here again."}
{"text":"Being from Canada, this Canadian establishment is a really great reminder of going to the KEG back home. The rib eye is to die for and the lobster is just amazing"}
{"text":"After watching construction for a few weeks I was really glad to see a keg open up in the Yonge/Sheppard neighbourhood as I often visit the Leslie and York mills area location at least once a month. I've visited twice here since they opened and was pleased with the service and food quality that you come to expect from the keg. There is a lot of staff on hand since they are just starting up so it can seem busier than it is but the training is going great and the staff are excellent. I really like the bar staff at this location they make a great mojito, much better than most of the other locations I've been to and are super friendly and attentive. The dining room is really nice as well. The layout of the restaurant is not the greatest with almost a track style walkway around the bar that makes for poor flow and walking traffic on the first floor. All restrooms are on the second floor that require a few sets of stairs to get to so not a very handicap friendly design. Steaks were excellent and cooked well to order. Only food issue I've experienced is a few rushed orders of escargot that came out too watery and didn't taste right. Overall a good experience that I think will get better as the staff settle in."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite place at the Chandler Mall. The food is solid but more importantly it's so good. Its so good that I keep recommending it anyone who would listen. The service is impeccable. The booths are cozy. What more could you ask for? 

Ask for house salad with your filet mignon and a glass of Seven Oaks and you'll be in heaven. Or pretty close to it."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for our anniversary and the service was wonderful! They gave us a hand written anniversary card which is so thoughtful! Our waitress was wonderful and the food was worth the price. They also gave us a complimentary dessert, which after the card was not necessary! The atmosphere  is wonderful. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Last night was our first visit to this restaurant. It was beyond even my expectations. We have a new favorite steakhouse to go to for special occasions. The food, the service, and the atmosphere were all excellent. We look forward to being able to go here many many more times. I highly recommend The Keg Steakhouse!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere here.  Service is usually spot on.  Food is great for the prices.  Unfortunately, every time we sit in the bar area to catch a game, have a few glasses of wine, and grab some food, the wait staff is always congregating in the corner.  I have worked in many restaurants in the past and we were never allowed to hangout at the bar area the night of our shift and definitely not in our work clothes.  I never understood that rule, but now do.  It makes it really uncomfortable! They are usually rowdy and I've even seen someone bring a baby in who screamed for a good amount of our visit.  They also do this on the outdoor patio.  We have actually left and/or, begrudgingly, gone to a different place for a relaxing evening."}
{"text":"Surprised at the service here considering everyone else's reviews. None of the food was impressive, and I tried quite a few things with some friends. The managerial staff don't seem to handle any sort of food questions/complaints all that well, either. Its not that they were super rude, its just that they were...indifferent, it seemed."}
{"text":"My family and I went to the Keg for dinner to celebrate a birthday. From the time we were greeted at the door until the time we left, everything was pretty amazing! Our server was awesome and very polite, quick and attentive. The dinner entrees did take a long time to arrive at the table, however it was really crowded and there were a few large tables of parties as well. The striploin steak with shrimp and scallops was just incredible!! Probably the best I've ever had. Not here to write a book but, but if you're looking to head out to a more fancier steakhouse, please come here and have your meal."}
{"text":"Another awesome meal.  The wait can be long, but it is worth it.  This location is consistent, and is one of the better ones.  Impeccable service.  

We had 2 drinks, prime rib dinner, filet mignon (both came with salad, double baked potato, veggies), and one glass of expensive wine.  $105.

Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited the Keg on Dixon right before our trip out to Jamaica the next day. We are big fans of the Keg. Interesting experience, the waiter spilled an entire pint onto my lap, for my second drink. I was a little tick, wearing the only long pants for my trip south. However, the waiter was great, helped out wonderfully. He was mortified. The manager comped my meal and gave me a voucher for dry cleaning. Accidents happen and they dealth with it professionally and with great elan. I will eat there again, next time I'll bring a spare pare of pants.

Food was great as usual. The prime rib was delicious."}
{"text":"I would LOVE to rate them 5 stars, but can't because of the way they handled my food allergy (see below note). 

Service: if I could give 100 stars here for service from our waiter, I would. I'm a stickler for service and John B. was seriously AMAZING. I can't remember the last time I have had such amazing service. 

Food: Amazing. - had cesar and wedge salads (both $7)..both crisp and delicious.. 10oz prime rib ($25), twice baked potato (yesss!) and then the special- t-bone ($36) forget the oz ... added 1/2lb of king crab for $18 with mashed potatoes... A++

Drinks: Enjoyed the Celery Southside  (Hendrick's gin, lemon juice, simple syrup, muddled celery) - yummy! 

My issue here was that I have a food allergy and specifically made sure to tell them that an ALLERGY  was the reason I was ordering gluten free (not just a diet) and that I could not have onion rings on my plate. Our food arrived and low and behold... Onion rings (crispies, whatever they're called) on my plate, including under my mest. John did not deliver our food but came over a minute later and immediately saw them, apologized and took it back to the kitchen. A few minutes later, a manager dropped off my food and let me know that they had changed out my plate and put my *rare* piece of prime rib on the grill for a minute (I guess to \"kill\" the wheat that had contaminated it??).... First of all, when dealing with an allergy, that isn't the way to handle it - we put your meat on the grill so that it would break down the gluten... FYI gluten isn't broken down on a grill/fryer/etc. so that did nothing but I guess I can appreciate the effort.. Maybe? Also, that obviously turned my rare piece of meat into a medium (honestly maybe on the well-done side) piece of meat so it wasn't edible to me since I don't like to eat anything cooked more than medium-well. John, once again, apologized and could see there was zero pink so I was then served a delicious rare piece of prime rib."}
{"text":"It was a little pricey but it was a solid steak! We all enjoyed it and I would go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"We had an amazing dinner and our waiter was an  absolute gem. I had the New York done rare, woah! Talk about to die for!! Greatest dinner ever had."}
{"text":"Expected an up-scale,quality meal, especially when reviewing the menu prices. Instead, received (2) prime rib dinners that were at least 50% fat and gristle - not visually pleasing and not the taste of a quality prime rib.

Served with an au jus that was anything but complimenting and with horseradish that was way too hot. Comments to the waiter were met with a brush-off.  Again, not only the food served was way below scale, but so was the service attitude. Given the waiter was polite, but lacked the skill set to see what was wrong.

Bottom line - enter at your own risk.  Sub-standard food quality and service in a particularly noisy environment.  You can do better elsewhere."}
{"text":"Don't take reservations - unlike any other good steak house - disappointing if you want to plan a dinner with a client!"}
{"text":"My bf took me to the Keg for by birthday tonight and it was a great experience.

As I normally do, I had taken a look at the menu on line and had an idea what I'd order.  I'd locked onto the escargot for an appetizer and enjoyed it a lot.  It's not the best I've ever had but it was noteworthy.  No place can compete with the escargot at Rene in Tlaquepaque but this one deserves an honorable mention.

I'd pointed out the Mushrooms Neptune to my bf and he ordered those.  They were tasty too but the escargot definitely were better.  And I'm proud of my bf for wanting to give the snails a try and not turning his nose up at them like 99% of people do.  He is now an escargot fan too.

For my entree I ordered the sirloin and half lobster.  Both were delish though I devoted myself mainly to the lobster.  My doggies were happy with that because it meant there was a large piece of steak coming home to them.  

The bf order the seafood sirloin, which is normally an 8 oz steak but since he wasn't sure that would be big enough for him, he went up to a 12 oz.  I know he liked the lobster, shrimp and asparagus topping on his steak but he did mention he wish he'd gotten prime rib instead.  He'd been to the Keg before and knew it was a winner.

Since I was a first time visitor, we received the complimentary shrimp cocktail.  I agree with what others have said which is that this is a great customer service tactic.  Guaranteed to make you feel welcome and also recommend the place to others.

And because it was also my birthday, let's not forget they gave us a complimentary dessert as well.  No corny song or anything, just my choice of dessert (creme brulee, very yum!) with a candle in it.  

With all that we ordered, we were out the door for $100 (tip included).  I don't think any other steakhouse of this caliber could match the value."}
{"text":"One of my favorite late night dinner places.

Generous portion sizes of a variety of steaks! I also love their French onion soup with crisp bread and melted cheese goodness. Their salads are huge and very very reasonably priced. Great place for a date. Also, be sure to pick up one of their dinner mints on the way out. It's the only place that has it! Mint hard shell candy with gooey chocolate in the middle. Love it."}
{"text":"Don't think I've ever had a bad experience at this location! 

Staff is always attentive, knowledgeable, and polite. The brie starter was amazing, blue cheese bacon steak was fantastic, and the creme brulee was outstanding. The only downside is the price, but I visit here knowing that, and understand it's backed by a great experience. Perfect place for a date night."}
{"text":"Went to the Keg last night for our anniversary.  The first time we'd been there in awhile.  Really wanted an awesome steak so we headed there.  

Service - A+ (Dani); 
Bread - A+; 
Atmosphere A+; 
Shrimp - A+; Potatoes/Rice - A+; 
Steak - D.  

We both ordered Medium hoping for pink on the inside.  they really stressed that they wanted our Steak to come out like we ordered them.  They even have a complete definition of all the temperature options on the menu.  My steak was completely overdone and very tough, couldn't eat it after the first bite.  Hers was OK, a little too rare.  Gristle throughout.  Not just a little fat, this was gristle.  

We went for the steak and were highly disappointed.  This was Black Angus or Sizzler quality.  

They did bring us a free awesome desert (Mocha Ice Cream on Oreo crust)."}
{"text":"Delicious keg burger, when I finally got it.  Arrived at 1:30 on weekday so place half empty.  Service very slow.  Another beer?   Waited 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Great steak! Picked up the peppercorn steak which was to die for! Excellent bread as a starter and the caesar salad with lemon was amazing. Mike, our server, was helpful and really made for a pleasant visit. Great steak house."}
{"text":"We thoroughly enjoyed our dining experiences at the Keg. We came in the first time for my husband's birthday. We were about 30 minutes early for our reservation, and while they didn't seem busy, they wouldn't seat us right away, but we were able to enjoy a drink at the bar while we waited. Our waitress, Kat, was attentive and kind, and our entrees were DELICIOUS. They were cooked perfectly and arrived in a timely fashion. Since we were celebrating, we were given a slice of their special ice cream cake to top off the meal! I saw ahead of time about their birthday promotion via email, and we were able to use that discount. We will definitely be back for other special occasions, but it's a little too pricey for regular visits.

We also came in for Easter and were pleasantly surprised that they were serving their whole menu, not just their special holiday menu!"}
{"text":"Excellent service. A little over priced for what you get. Food is average and small portions. French onion soup was great as  as bread. For this type of steakhouse you would figure that the bread would just come out but we had to ask when or emails were served if there was any bread and then got it. We didn't get charged but I don't know what the normal is for that"}
{"text":"Just went for a steak. The customer service was excellent the manager came out ask us how our food was it was prepared perfectly I give it 10 thumbs up."}
{"text":"Awesome dinner, great service, super great food.  Outstanding dessert.  Definitely worth coming here. We will come back."}
{"text":"I have tried this place several times and each time just keeps getting worse and worse. The happy hour menu is disappointing. The drinks are sugary and weak. My food order always comes out wrong. I ordered the mushrooms stuffed with crab and they were awful.  The crab was super fishy.  I will be taking my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"First and foremost... Minus one star for the hostesses' uniforms.  Super short black mini skirts with black stockings... Give all of those outfits back to the 80s! The girls looked cold and awkward.  Terrible initial impression. 

The food was fairly average.  I've had better wedge salads, but decent attempt.  The filet was properly cooked and the twice cooked potato tasted like it should.  The restaurant was a touch dark and loud for my taste, but overall a decent ambiance."}
{"text":"Where do I begin....I just moved here from Chicago and was \"hoping\" for my first great meal. After seeing the reviews on Yelp; we gave it a try. We started off with bacon wrapped scallops and shrimp cocktail. The shrimp were huge and were amazing. The scallops had a sweetness to them, we're perfect texture, and are the BEST I have ever had.

I ordered the Rib Steak (bone in) with the twice baked potato and added the lobster tail. The bone in was chard to perfection and was mouth watering...seriously it was amazing. The twice baked had more favors than I could guess. The lobster tail was at expectation. It wasn't bad but it didn't overachieve my expectations

The staff and service was phenomenal!!!! This is my favorite place in the Phoenix area. Superb!!!.,"}
{"text":"I really like this place but they screw up some easy things which I think is problematic. 

When my cousin and I got there, we were eventually greeted by a server who was super casual. Don't get me wrong, I don't need pomp and circumstance, but when the kid at In N Out is more professional, then Houston we got a problem.

Secondly for some crazy reason, the booth behind ours had about 25 outdoor seat cushions stacked up. I know they are for outside, and need to go somewhere, but this is Saturday night at 7. Put them AWAY. They spent thousands of dollars on ambiance, only to ruin it with a stack of cushions? Weird.

Ok KEG, those are some issues that need work. The food was good as usual, but it's not enough to carry a sketchy service otherwise. Ironically we chose KEG over Durant's which in retrospect- was a grave error."}
{"text":"We have went to The Keg many times and always had a good experience. Today was the exception....  we took my 89 year old Mom and her 92 year old friend for dinner. We arrived at 4pm since they like eating early and that is when the restaurant opens.

We had a 20+ minute wait to be seated, even though there was only a few other customers. Then we were taken to a very small booth that was suitable for 2 people, not 4. When Mom asked about a bigger booth, she was told 'those are for other parties with more than 4'... it took having to be sort of nasty before we could sit in a booth with more room.

Food was ok, wait staff ok. Still don't understand making people wait to be seated with a close to empty restaurant. Probably won't be back - there's lots of other great steak places!"}
{"text":"I give the keg steakhouse five stars. This was our first visit to the Keg at SanTan mall. Everything was perfect, the service was outstanding, our waiter was very polite, knowledgeable and was always checking on us to make sure we were satisfied. 
We started with a bottle of red wine and ordered the calamari appetizer, it was cooked perfectly and was delicious, our salad wedges were cold and crisp, our steaks were cooked exactly as we had asked and served hot. The miners pie was a great dessert to top off the meal. 
We thoroughly enjoyed our evening at the keg, we will definitely go back"}
{"text":"Never, ever disappointed here. We've come back several times and I haven't written a review- WHY?! 

Server was the best, pointed out the (new) appetizer he recommends the Lobster Gratiné, (Oven-baked lobster meat with garlic, herbs and melted Monterey Jack and Cheddar cheeses).  Very yummy, but not much in quantity, delicious meat though. I suggest getting the Calamari appetizer if you're looking for a little more to eat as an appetizer (one of our favs)!

I had the Lobster Crusted Sirloin (to absoloutely DIE for, super tender, moist, flavorful, didn't even raise my hand to get the A1). I barely have to in this place. 

Kris had the half lobster and steak. I've never seen any resteraunt cut a lobster in half the way that they do. No, not horizontally where the tail is separate from the head. Straight down sagittal. (Medical students, you know what I'm talkn' about!) Definitely a different cut, but he claims it's deliciousness and he dunks more pieces of it in the ramekin of hot, melted butter.

The manager also walked by and asked how we were doing, \"Great!\" we managed to say with our mouths full of food! Even baby didn't cry when he saw him.  Beautiful restaurant, great staff and unbelievable food."}
{"text":"Great service and great atmosphere but it stopped there. Food was bland and over priced. I will not go back!!!"}
{"text":"Every time that my family and/or friends go here for a special occasion (the last time was for my birthday this year): the staff was always accommodating and friendly. We are always pleased with their services and we have been going there for 7 years. The food is delicious and savory each time. I try to change up my eating preferences because I am never disappointed with what they have on the menu. Not to mention, they have great management."}
{"text":"We decided last minute to go out for a nice steak. Came here and we were not disappointed. A cozy table in the bar area was perfect. Great iceberg wedge to start then followed by filets. Here's where it started. Hers was perfect, mine was under cooked. A waiter (not ours) noticed this, swept it away and promised to remedy the temp. Immediately our server (Tatum) came over to check. She responded with the most professional answer ever...\"I'll follow up\". Not only did she follow up, but Taylor the manger checked 2x to assure we where satisfied. Nothing over the top, just genuine class service and attention to detail. 

We will be back. Thanks Tatum and Taylor!"}
{"text":"The Keg is our favorite restaurant. My husband and I have been to several 5 star keg restaurants such as Mastros City Hall and Steak 44 but we consider The Keg the best. We love the bacon wrapped steak and on our last visit I ordered the terryaki steak and loved it. Our last visit was on February 16 for our annual valentines date with our 2 little girls who are 2 years old and six months. I can tell the server treated us differently because of it compared to how he was with the older people next to us. But I am proud to say that our kids never made a noise or a mess. They know how to handle themselves at restaurants. Love the food and will be going back."}
{"text":"Headliner: Just your run of the mill steak place.  Don't bother with anything else.

The Keg is your typical steakhouse in Chandler.  There is a nice outdoors patio area and happy hour from 4pm to 7pm. There is a three course prix fixe menu for $39.95 as well as the regular menu.  The specialty is obvious on reading the menu - they put a BIG emphasis on how they prepare their steaks.

We were sat in the main dining room, and immediately served water - in wine glasses, which was kind of weird.  The bread course was a good white individual loaf - freshly baked and well executed, but really nothing special.

My dining partner, Dan, had a ceasar salad.  It was exactly what you would expect from a ceasar salad - uninspired.  The croutons at Firebirds (just round the corner) are a step above what was served here.  I had a spinach salad, with mandarin oranges, dried cranberries, pecans, red onions and the option of goat cheese or blue cheese (which was my option).  There could have been a little more dressing, and the dressing itself was a weak dressing.  THe salad was a little dry, but the components went together and were tasty.

Salad was a spinach salad, with mandarin oranges, dried cranberries, pecans and red onions and option of goat cheese or bleu cheese (my opt).  There could have ben a little more dressing, and the dressing itself was a weak dressing. It was a little dry, but all the components were good.

I decided on a medium rare top sirloin with sweet potato fries.  The fries were nice and crispy, and there was a grilled tomato on the side with some cheese melted on top.  There was also some sort of garlic mayo type dipping sauce for the fries.  The steak was perfectly cooked.  The highlight to me was the garlic dipping sauce.  I kept going back for the fries just as an excuse to keep on dipping.

Overall, a decent place."}
{"text":"We eat here a lot and I can't say enough about this place!  The food is always excellent and consistent.  The service is exceptional 80% of the time and very good the other 20%.  We are huge patio diners and this is one of our favorites.  The happy hour prices and large wine servings CAN'T be beat!

Our ONLY complaint is that they don't formally seat on the patio, it's first come first serve which can get a little brutal and uncomfortable for those waiting for a table and those sitting at a table enjoying their meal with people staring at them waiting for them to leave."}
{"text":"For me, the food is just ok.  This place has a beautiful wait staff and is fun to drink at with friends so that is what saves it."}
{"text":"I agree with a few others on here that said it's a good meal but not great.  I still give it 4 stars because the Keg atmosphere is hard to beat."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Had my first meal here the other night and the menu was pricer than I thought but it wouldn't break the bank eating here so we gave it a shot. I had ribs. They were ok..not great and for $22 I have had better and you only get one side. My french fries seemed not fresh. Surprised for the price you do not get a small salad. My husband got the prime rib which again was ok..not great and we have had better food for less money at Black Angus and Outback. The waitress was annoyingly trying to upsell sides, as if paying $22 for a meal and one side was not enough. We had our 2 year old son with us so we were going to share with him since he never finishes any kids meal. She tried to get us to pay $13 for a kids meal of ribs. Ripoff. After the bread,  and the little fruit plate they gave him he was full anyways. Ovbiously they try to run your bill up since they can make more as a tip but all the attempting upselling was annoying for overpriced food anways."}
{"text":"We were on an unexpected stopover in Toronto and visited the branch of The Keg near our airport accommodation.

The decor is cozy and service was professional.  Drinks were good - marguerita for example was served using fresh lines in its preparation.

we were not too hungry so simply had appetizers - the escargot were served piping hot and tasty and the shrimp cocktail was pleasant.

Thank you."}
{"text":"Love this place. Very personalized service. Meat is excellent. Desserts are great too. Creme brûlée"}
{"text":"After our terrible experience, management made things right by sending out a gift card and inviting us to come back. We finally went back and used our gift card. The food was mediocre at best and service was still poor. Needless to say I think our dining at the keg has ended."}
{"text":"First time at this new location in North York. I have been to other Keg locations in Mississauga, Cambridge and the Mansion and what brings me back to the Keg is the level of service and food. 

I love the decor at this new location with their modern and upscale look. They have two dining floors with the washrooms located on the second floor which is accessible by the stairs or elevator. 

I came with my wife and daughter and we had an early reservation. Even though we came early, we were promptly led to our booth. Our server Ian was attentive and informative. He asked us if we were celebrating anything and unfortunately, we were not. He told us about the Special: coffee bean encrusted steak but the three of us decided to go with the Keg Classics: the Top Sirloin and two Prime Ribs, all in Medium Rare. We also ordered two appetizers: the Garlic Cheese bread and the Calamari. 

The Calamari was good but I would skip the Cheese bread. Usually I love tons of cheese but it made the bread too oily. The steak and prime ribs were excellent. They were cooked to our liking. We had mixed greens and Caesar salads to start along with a complementary bread and butter to start. The dishes came out in proper sequence and we didn't feel like we were rushed to finish a dish before the other one came. 

We loved our dinner and I recommend checking this location out.

{"text":"Perfect for a family dinner and to have great moment with your friends. Large patio to see the sunset during the happy hours. You can enjoy good glass of wine. The menu have large choice. You have to try the tuna tacos. Mini burger were tasty as well. Staff was good except one she wans't professional maybe a beginner. Correct price for the spot. so if you are looking for a good restaurant, go to the KEG"}
{"text":"Dining experience here has been getting worse and worse, it's now declined to the point I will not even go there for my free birthday dinner. Food not prepared as requested, service below par and if you dare to complain management treats you like a criminal! Just awful."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Got bacon wrapped filet medium rare, cooked perfectly. Blue cheese crust. Twice baked potato. Average wine list. Nice service, comfortable seating. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I have been to The Keg many many times in the past and sometimes it was good and sometimes it was so so.  This time however was really great!  Sat in the bar at a table, so we could take advantage of Happy Hour and have dinner.  Our server was great, really attentive but not too much.  The real surprise was in the food, I dont know if they changed chefs or what but the food was seriously top notch. Everything was cooked perfectly and tasted great!"}
{"text":"We went to the Keg to celebrate our anniversary. The atmosphere was great, the service was really good and the food was excellent. We ordered from the restaurant week menu. The appetizer we got was the baked garlic shrimp and we really liked it, very cheesy, garlic forward and lots of butter, could have done with less butter, but is was good. The entrée I got was the rib eye, my favorite cut of steak, it was delicious a very large piece of meat I took home most of it and had it for breakfast the next day. I ordered it medium well and it was cooked just right, the steak was just so flavorful, WOW! will definitely order that again. My husband had the filet mignon wrapped in applewood bacon it came with a bearnaise sauce, he really enjoyed it, meat was very tender and cooked just right. The deserts were not as good we ordered and shared the cheese cake, it was just okay, and we also got the Spanish coffee, it had brandy, coffee and whipped cream on top,  though it would be a nice end to the dinner, but I could barely taste any brandy and it was just really too sweet , I would not get that again. But the dinner overall we really enjoyed and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Very easy to set a reservation and the staff were very accommodating and friendly. The food was absolutely perfect! I wasn't too fond of the drink that I ordered, but that didn't affect my overall experience with the place.

Everyone at our table ordered steak. We ordered 2 New York Strips and 1 Peppered Steak. I usually always order rare, but I wish I had ordered the Medium. My steak was cooked perfectly, but I tried the Medium cooked steak and it was also very juicy with extra flavor from the grill that my rare piece didn't have (obviously because it was taken off sooner). Still so amazing though. The proportions are very filling!

The main menu and kids menu all contain great selections. It was very difficult to decide. We celebrated a birthday and the staff was so kind to bring a complimentary dessert and something special for the child at the table (vanilla ice cream). The ice cream was actually amazing also, not the typical vanilla you can get anywhere.  The complimentary birthday dessert was a slice of mocha java ice cream pie with an Oreo crust.... absolutely spectacular! 

This place is SO good that you'll want to come back, I know we certainly will. You could easily spend over $100 in one visit here."}
{"text":"Excellent steakhouse overall.

The servers here are very friendly (and markedly pretty while being appropriately dressed)...our first server James actually recommended that we sit in the lounge area for drinks even though it meant passing us off to a different server. The seating and atmosphere was great - comfy, chill, and welcoming. Definitely a great place for a drink.

We all ordered steaks, I tried all of them, and I honestly have nothing I could possibly complain about. All of them were delivered at the right temps and were impressively delicious.

Only complaint was the well drinks. Watered down  with chlorine water.

Still a well-earned 4 stars."}
{"text":"its good restaurant, a little bit loud especially  next to the bar.
Steak was amazing."}
{"text":"Just came back from a very disappointing experience.  Waited 45 minutes on a Wednesday night.   Sat near the bar and ordered appetizers while we waited for dinner.  Wine was nice and average price.  Fried calamari was overcooked and rubbery.  Sent it back.  Replacement appetizer didn't arrive until 20 minutes later.  At that point, we didn't even want it.  Sat down to dinner and ordered filet mignon and lobster tail.   Meat was wrapped in rubbery/almost raw bacon.  Bearnaise sauce was cold.  Lobster tail was overcooked and dry.  Mashed potatoes were the highlight unfortunately.   Ordered cheesecake which was awful!  Tasted like out of a box from a supermarket freezer...had a fake gelatin like after taste.  Left the restaurant upset having spent $225 for three people...wow - food was just a few pegs above Applebees - really!  The back room they put us in was barren, dark and depressing.  For this kind of money, we would have also expected tablecloths and candles or flowers.   

Wait staff was excellent by the way.

Won't be back unless its for a quick Kobe burger.  Had one of those the last time and it was really nice and reasonably priced.

{"text":"We decided to eat at The Keg recently as the nearby Barnes & Noble was the only place in town that had an item in stock that I needed that weekend. We chose immediate seating on the patio rather than a 45 minute wait inside. The misters had been going full force when we arrived, so we thought it wouldn't be too bad. We were mistaken. They are pointed at the arriving patrons, and not on the poor suffering fools on the patio. The initial table to which we were led was completely wobbly, so we asked the server if we could change to one not even 10 feet away. This, apparently, caused a rift in the universe from which the rest of the serving staff failed to recover for the remainder of our time there. We watched several of our dishes walk on by, and bewildered staff take them back indoors, only to return minutes later and ask, \"Did you switch tables?\" Wow. There are three other tables out here, in completely different stages of their meal. How hard would it have been to figure it out?

Anyway, the food was not bad at all. Our beers were cold and tasty. The bread was just OK- hot and crusty, but a little bland and doughy in the middle. My Caesar salad was overdressed for my taste, but Hubby's French Onion Soup was delicious- when he finally got it. The wait was ridiculous, even after our server said she was checking on it twice and a manager did as well. Hubby's french dip sandwich was less rare than he likes (Houston's french dip is his gold standard), but far better than many others we've had. He liked the fresh horseradish a lot. My prime rib was fork-tender, a little fatty, but quite tasty. 

A storm blew in quickly, with bad winds that forced us indoors to track down our waitress and check. She then ran out to collect the family with 2 young girls and brought them inside. Overall, the meal was about a 3.5, but the service was dreadful. Hopefully for The Keg, this is a new restaurant issue, and they will get their act together. Also be warned that this location is only open for dinner right now, and that many menu items that have been highly recommended by other Yelpers are lunch items available at other Kegs only."}
{"text":"I just had one of the best dining experiences I've had in a LONG time. We went to the Keg with their birthday club coupon (see instructions below) and had a great meal for a steal of a price. I feel like I got away with something to good to be true, so much so, that I want to go back to make a deposit in my karma bank. 

First of all, Keg has a great happy hour that I always seem to forget about until I go there for dinner. This time, we remembered right as we were walking in and decided to sit in the bar for dinner (good decision #2, #1 was going there in the first place). 

Briana was our server and she was great! Very friendly, the perfect balance of attentive but not overly so. Never seemed like we were annoying her with our \"one more minute\" or \"on the side\" requests. Nor, did she seemed bothered by the fact that we had the email birthday coupon for a free prime rib dinner ($23 value). The best part is you don't even have to get the prime rib, you can get anything you want want and they credit your check for the $23. 

Happy hour is M-F 4-7 with a few $5 appetizers, half price wines by the glass, draft beers, and $3.75 Orange Crush Martinis (one of the best martinis ever!). The only thing is that HH is only in the bar or the patio. So, if you'll take a moment to connect the dots with me, I can have dinner in the dining area and pay full price for glass of wine, or I can eat dinner in the bar and get the wine for half price. Um, I think the answer is obvious. 

Dinner was great. We both ordered from the seasonal crab menu. I got the mushroom and crab crusted sirloin and the birthday boy got the sirloin topped with crab and roasted red pepper sauce. Both came with a potato side (baked for me, mashed for him). Everything was cooked perfectly to our request and so delish! 

Toward the end of my meal, I reached what I like to call the \"point of no return.\" This is where there is not enough to take home, but just enough to push me over the edge of way too full if I eat it all. While I was just about to go in for it and stuff myself, Briana showed up to check on us. She easily made the decision for me and said \"Take it home!\" Maybe three to four bites of my sirloin left and she not only didn't make me feel like an idiot for wanting to save it, but she encouraged it. I heart her! Added half of the baked potato, a piece of the delicious soft bread, and the thick tomato slice garnish from the boys plate.  Plenty for lunch tomorrow!

Oh, and one more thing I love about the Keg; Keg size glasses of wine. A nine ounce pour at a great price. Perfect for two people to each get one when they want a little more than one glass, but not quite enough to finish a whole bottle! And with the 1/2 price wines by the glass during happy hour, it's AMAZING!! 

OK, here is what I think you need to do. 
1 - go to kegsteakhouse.com and sign up for their newsletter (birthday club). 
2 - check your email at the beginning of the month of your birthday. 
3 - go to the Keg (with the coupon, if you can wait that long, or when ever you just want a good meal) 
4 - sit in the bar, M-F, from 4-7, for happy hour drinks and appetizers. 
5 - if you're still hungry, order dinner and eat in the bar area, getting the best of both worlds! 
6 - don't forget about the draft beers for $3, the Keg size wine pours, and the ultimate Orange Crush Martini!!! 
7 - rinse and repeat, I mean go back again and again . . . 

I'm going to!"}

The quality of shrimp they use now on top of the Oscar filet is just not worth it for more than $30.  The steak was overcooked etc. I could keep on but I dont feel like it anymore."}
{"text":"I was ecstatic to eat here, even without knowing what sort of restaurant it was and with a name like \"The Keg\", how could it not be awesome? 

Well, let me tell you. I can't remember what I ordered, I believe it was some sort of chicken but the taste lead me to believe it was pork? I'm not sure how that happened but I have never paid more for such a mediocre piece of meat in all my days. My partner experienced the same with her unimpressive steak. I LOVE steak. This charred piece of cow ass was fried bologna. 

But beyond the average meal, average service and outrageous bill, I wondered to myself, why is The Keg wasting its name on a restaurant like THIS? Why can't it be something awesome where you sit on empty kegs or there is a keg in the middle of your table with your own personal tap? Why am I even here when there are so many delicious restaurants within a 5 mile radius of this place that would be so much more fulfilling? 

Why God, why?"}
{"text":"First let me just say our waitress, Kyl, was amazing. Super sweet and bubbly. She made our first experience with The Keg a perfect one. I wish every waitress/waiter had her upbeat and happy attitude. The food was perfect. I had a filet, and I am very specific about how I like my steaks cooked; well done. Most places can't get it right, but it was cooked exactly how I like it. And it wasn't dry at all. My husband got ribs and chicken and the chicken was tender, juicy and flavorful. I didn't try his ribs, but he ate those up! We will definitely be returning for special occasions as it is a little pricey but so worth it."}
{"text":"Went back for our 4th or 5th time, the new Summer Lobster menu lured us in. All three of us ordered the Lobster and Shrimp Summer Salad. Big disappointment. As we drove away I said \" maybe I don't really like Lobster\". My companions felt it wasn't really lobster. The Shrimp wasn't that good, either. The vegetables were great, but at $22.95 for a salad, it's not worth it. My salad had half a dozen small mushrooms, my wife found only one in hers. If this had been our first visit, we would not return. We may not anyway. Suggest if this is the best they can do, 86 the salad."}
{"text":"While at the Angels game in Tempe, I bought 50/50 raffle tickets and sadly did not win. But on the back of the raffle ticket was $25 off coupon for the The Stag Bar. Our group decided to try it out. 

[Ambiance]
We only sat in the bar area but it was very modern and the area was pretty big. Plenty of seats at the bar and surrounding area.

[Food]

The bread to start was ok. Nothing to write home about. Although, we thoroughly enjoyed the Scallops and Bacon appetizer.

The wedge salad with ranch which was really good. For the  entree, I ordered the 14 oz prime rib which I thought was excellent! Along with that came a baked potato, green beans and mushrooms. All were very tasty.

My friends ordered the chicken and ribs and seared ahi tacos which they also enjoyed. 

For dessert, we got the Billy Miner Pie which was an ice cream like dessert. It was pretty good too.

[Service]

Service was excellent! Our waitress Jessi (that was name on the bill), from Mesa  (I think), did an exceptional job refilling our drinks and making sure we had what we needed at all times.

I would definitely return to the Keg Steakhouse and Bar when I come back to AZ.. even without the $25 off!"}
{"text":"Great steak ..had the fillet with veggies. Try the cheescake while you are at it if you have room! Everything cooked perfectly and awesome service!"}
{"text":"This restaurant never disappoints. We usually go for the steak. Which is hands down the best steak in the valley. But we decided to try their Thanksgiving meal special. It was delicious! It came with a Caesar salad, turkey, mashed potatoes, stuffing, green beans, cranberry sauce, gravy and a slice of cheesecake."}
{"text":"Had a perfect dinner with friends at the Keg last night. Everything was fantastic. One of the best meals we have had there, or just about anywhere, in a while. Can't think of anything that could have been done to improve it. Bravo to the Keg!!!!!"}
{"text":"I  have never been to a restaurant with better customer service.  The staff at this location are out of this world.  The food is amazing as well.  Everytime we go we have had delicous prime rib and sirloins.  Happy hour is a great time to test it out, but you wouldn't be disappointed for dinner.  We love going during the week on Monday or Tuesday when it isn't very busy."}
{"text":"Pricey but amazing.  Savings tip- register on their website before your birthday month and get a buy one get one free meal coupon to be used any time that month on any meal.  Amazing food- bread, salad, main course (prime rib) and sides were all done just right, to perfection, with just the right hint of everything!  Prompt, attentive, polished service.  Reservations recommended."}
{"text":"The Keg has transitioned nicely from when I used to eat there as a kid in the Northwest.  It used to be on parwith several of the other lower class steak joints and used to be known for it's salad bar and affordable meals.  Now, this place has top notch food, service and is an overall great dining experience.

We have been here several times for dinner dates and other occasions.  Every time we leave we talk about how impressed we are with this place.

Great food, excellent staff, awesome cocktail menu and drinks, and overall great place to have a nice meal, eat a good steak, and not have to go to a high end steak joint that costs $500 and takes 4 hours.  Nothing wrong with that, because I love a prime steak joint, but this fills a necessary void."}
{"text":"For the record, I didn't have the steak. 

The first time I ever went to the keg was New Years Eve night 2014 and I haven't been back since.

I ordered chicken at the keg and I wasn't impressed at all. The portions were very small for the price and it wasn't really anything special. The booths are also very tiny as well here, definitely not somewhere you could get comfortable. 

I don't want to judge the wait staff to hard since it as New Year's Eve, but he was pretty much nonexistent. I feel like it would of been better if it was a different night, it also took over an hour to finally get a table/booth. 

It was really just mediocre and for $25+ a meal that wasn't anything special... I'd go elsewhere honestly."}
{"text":"This restaurant is awesome! The ambiance is terrific, the service is first-rate and the food is out of sight!!!! A Solid 5 Stars!!! Be sure to make reservations a couple days in advance!"}
{"text":"I am new to area.  Great place to eat a premium steak or just hang out at very nice bar. Appetizers are excellent 
Happy hour Jay Lohr  is yummy. Bartenders are top shelf
Great place"}
{"text":"Really good meal, spinach salad was nice and cold fresh greens good amount of Feta, pecans, and crasins and correctly dresses. The entree the 7 oz filet was a perfect medium and I got it topped with the shrimp and scallops with bernaise and everything was nice and hot and correctly cooked. The garlic mashes potatoes had lumps in them Yumm. The bread was wam but the butter Rock hard. The one thing that did bug a little bit was when I asked the server what their favorite item was it was recited like they had memorized it and it was part of the routine not from the heart. I would come back."}
{"text":"Baseball steak is the best!  Black cod is excellent!  The coffee was perfect and cheese cake just ok.
The outside dining is my favorite in the valley.  Waiter was excellent as well"}
{"text":"The steaks were fantastic. The appetizers were also. Everything was served quickly. I would like the twice baked stuffed potato a little warmer but the taste was fine."}
{"text":"The steaks were fantastic as were the appetizers and dessert and coffee. I would like the stuffed baked potato a little warmer the next time. Our waitress, Jordan, was perfect. Thank you, Tyler, for a great dinner. Perfect seating outside in the cool Phoenix Fall. See you again  soon!"}
{"text":"Everything about the keg is awethom! (Awesome). Except the wait, which wasn't too bad. We went on Saturday night and it was hoppin. The wait was about 30 minutes but well worth it. Beer was good, staff was friendly. Prices were average, portions large. Go check it out!"}
{"text":"Do not order from postmates  or carry out from here . They leave out missing items and say it's not their fault . I will be contacting corporate ."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner last night with my family. Our server was Cheyanne and she did an amazing job at  walking us through the menu. She knew how appeal to each of our senses and so it was very difficult to choose our entrees! We ended up ordering the Pistachio Salmon (amazing), Teriyaki Steak (also amazing) and the Prime Rib (melted in your mouth). Although it was just an ordinary Tuesday evening, the restaurant was extremely busy. Our food took a little over 35 minutes to come to our table but we didn't mind the wait one bit! The manager, Taylor, was very apologetic but funny and personable. We were very, very pleased with the entire experience and will definitely be making a trip back!"}
{"text":"Undercooked steak (on one side) over cooked steak (on the other side). Ignored by the server but manager picked up the tab."}
{"text":"I like special dining experiences for birthdays, so I chose to visit the Keg this year. We made reservations and when we got there, there was a card wishing me happy birthday with several signatures from the staff. It's a nice personal touch that starts off the night right. The service was excellent, our waiter was very personable and was always quick with a new drink or refill. The food was outstanding and well worth the price. Birthdays also deserve a dessert, so I ordered the Brownie Sunday which was delicious and way more than I could eat, so I shared it with my family. The Manager stopped by during the meal to check on the service and the food which is a nice touch, we also was the one to bring out the dessert and included a candle, wished me a happy birthday and comped the dessert. Overall our experience at The Keg was very enjoyable and I can definitely recommend it for any special occasion."}
{"text":"Shrug....if you didn't know better, this might seem like a good place to eat. If you haven't had better, I have. Waste of money, there places that are better for less money. I'll leave The Keg to the prommers."}
{"text":"Ok so this place is called The Keg. Which brings to mind lots of beer right? Here are the choices this evening in tap. Colors Light, Molsen Golden, some Arizona Peach swill, Negra Modelo, and some light ale by Lieinenlogurls or something. What a joke. Change the name please or get some craft brews. Oh and it's owned by some Canadian company so that explains a lot. Very expensive steaks as well.  Steak was overlooked and only 7 oz for $28??!! Skip it."}
{"text":"This is a good place to take your sweetheart to. They are a little pricey but this is a steakhouse. The appetizers are very good and paired well with the wine of choice. The prime rib was good but seemed the same as anywhere else. The filet with exceptional and they made sure that it was cooked to perfection. Great choice."}
{"text":"Went there last week with 4 other associates all here in Chandler from CT. Everything was fantastic: the atmosphere, the drinks, the food and the service. As we were all here for business, each of us needed separate checks and split checks for food and liquor. This was no issue and the server was extremely helpful in explaining the different menu options - very helpful as some of the associates had never been to a steakhouse like this. I would definitely recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"My wife and I go here about 3-5 times a year,  mostly for anniversaries, birthdays, or a  happy hour on the patio when we have a babysitter for our toddlers.  Over the course of 4+ years, The Keg has been consistently great to us.  Number one for me is the service.  It is always top notch, professional, attentive, personable but not pushy.  The food is fantastic. I always go for a steak because it is a steak house.  Usually I get a sirloin oscar style cooked medium.  Only once have I sent it back because it wasn't cooked right which is doing very well in my opinion.  And the oscar style is remarkably delicious.  Not many steakhouses will offer a steak that way and The Keg does it wonderfully every time.  My wife has rotated between filets and chicken dishes and has loved every one.  Her latest attempt at the Thai Chicken dish was super flavorful and a good portion with the mashed potatoes.  We both love their Caesar salads as they are a good size and contain an appropriate amount of dressing.  All in all, we have enjoyed a consistently great experience at The Keg for several years."}
{"text":"I'm a huge steak fan, so of course I always enjoy trying out the steak houses around Phoenix. 

The steaks here can be great, but for some reason my steak never comes out cooked the way I want it to. I always order medium rare, but for some reason it either comes out blue rare or over cooked. My 4 year old son received a steak that had more flavor at was more rare than mine. The other times I've been my husband received his steak exactly the way he wanted but mine was never right. 

The manager and waiter have always graciously fixed my meal, even if it still wasn't what I wanted afterward, and apologized profusely. 
I do agree with the guy that said the bread really isn't that great.

I can say that their side vegetables and baked potatoes are always delicious, so much so that I think it is what has me coming back. Wine was always great, also. 

The number one thing I love about this restaurant is that all of the staff has always been really friendly and gracious (except for one bartender, but I can't recall her name). I don't usually spend much time in the bar area, so it really doesn't affect me. The decor is beautiful and everyone is very friendly. 

Anyone with kids, this is an absolutely wonderful place to bring them! I've never had a restaurant cater to my child so much! They provided small snacks for my son to nibble on while waiting for the food and a nice little activity book for him to work on. I would come back to this restaurant just for that fact!

Overall, I've never had a good experience with my steak, but everyone else always has and the rest of the food has been good to me. Waitstaff is friendly and helpful, and the restaurant itself is beautiful."}
{"text":"The filet?  Like butta.  Best steak I can remember."}
{"text":"My friend had the baked halibut with a twice baked potato. He loved them both. I got the top sirloin with rice pilaf and mushrooms. Everything was excellent. As soon as I ried the rice I knew I made a good choice. wild rice with tons of flavor. It went really well with my steak. Nothing but good things to say about the entire experience. My dinner was only $25 which was very reasonable for the quality and portion. 2 people dinner 1 drink each was like $72 plus tip. If your in the area I would defiantely give this place a try."}
{"text":"Incredible food and outstanding service! 
Everyone that worked there was just as nice as could be. 
I got the pecan crusted sirloin and my husband got the rib eye. They were both delicious and came out at perfect timing. 
The prices are decent and definitely well worth it for the great experience."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to give this place a try for our wedding anniversary. I mentioned it was our anniversary when we arrived and they provided us with a card, which was very nice. The interior is dark and comfortable and we were excited about the menu options. I ordered a filet and requested it medium well to well. I told the server that I only wanted a slight pink in my steak, no more, and he said that it was not a problem. My husband ordered a NY strip and asked for medium rare.
Low and behold, our food arrives and neither steak is correct. My husband's steak is cooked medium, and my steak is a medium also, nowhere near medium well, let alone well. My husband decided to just eat his, but I am simply unable to eat steak that is under cooked so much, so mine had to go back. When I waved the server over, he quickly grabbed my plate as I told him what the issue was and took it back to the kitchen. He never actually came to a full stop at our table, nor did he apologize that the steak wasn't cooked properly.
So now my husband is eating and I'm not. My steak finally came back when my husband was about done with his food. Since they simply put my filet back in to cook longer after it had been cut open, instead of preparing me a new one, I now had a steak that was well done, but dry and not nearly as tender. It was the manager who brought it back, and he also did not apologize for the under cooked steak. He did come back later to ask me if the steak was okay, and I just said it was fine because I was over it. On the plus side, the bernaise was very good, so it made the dry, less than tender steak more pleasant to eat.
They did end up giving us a free slice of their Billy Miner Pie to split. It was good. I'm not sure if they gave this to us because it was our anniversary, because of the steak, or both. But at that point both my husband and I were already settled in our disappointment.
In the end, I spent $90 on a steak dinner for our wedding anniversary, both of our steaks were cooked improperly, we didn't get to share a meal together, and an apology was never offered for the improperly prepared food. Overall, a big let down."}
{"text":"We made a last minute reservation to try The Keg. While we did expect a long wait that's what we were told, we got seated pretty quickly. Our waitress took our order and we had a bit of a wait. We noticed she was pretty preoccupied and busy throughout the meal but our food was really good. so we'll give them another chance and hope the service is better!"}
{"text":"Took my daughter there for her birthday dinner with her family.  Fabulous food cooked to perfection.  My daughter is very picky as she is a waitress ... Our waitress was a doll & have wonderful attentive service with a smile.  Great evening!"}
{"text":"i've been to the keg plenty of time and this locating about 4 times.i felt that this time the food tasted a bit different.i ordered whet i usually ordered which is the cesar salad and tuna tartare.something about the tartare this time  was a bit off the tuna was not seasoned it was very bland,and my salad was not cut properly there were big slices of lettuce which i personally do not like in my salad i prefer smaller pieces of lettuce.the steak and lobster tails were cooked perfectly.i appreciated them giving two pieces due to the size of them which she explain that because of the season the tails are smaller.We had a issue with one of our friends steak,he had to give the steak back 3 times before it was cooked correctly.the manager apologized and said the kitchen was a bit overwhelmed because they were short staff.They comped his bill and said next time we come back he will take care of us.you can always count of the keg for making a bit situation turning out good!!thanks Maika"}
{"text":"I was not blown away with my meal. I ordered a NY Strip and it came with a side. I ordered it medium rare and I received a well done steak. I sent the steak back and I got a new one when most everyone at my table was finished. A little disappointing, expected a place that charges 32 per steak would want to get it right the first time. The service was good, but she disappeared shortly after we got our plates. I was comped a free drink for the hassle. I will not go out of my way to come back."}
{"text":"Best steak ever. Much better favor than black angus :) love the rib steak, very juicy, also very fatty. Can't get the best of both healthy and taste I guess... veggies on the plate are well done, fresh and crunchy juicy. Sourdough bread is hot and yumm. Like the special of the night, surf and turf, Top sirloin 8 oz with a jumbo shrimp, scallops, lobsters $38 not on the menu. Great service. 
With the birthday coupon, best value ever"}
{"text":"We came for Lobster Fest and everything was excellent. The losters are two pound and are flown in from Nova Scotia twice a week. Highly recommended, service and food was outstanding."}
{"text":"This is always my birthday dinner stop! the prime rib is outstanding!! this time I got the turf & surf! service is what you would expect from a steak house of this caliber. prompt, friendly and ready with the drinks!!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at this location twice and have enjoyed both visits. I've had the prime rib which was cooked to perfection and a sirloin with lobster and shrimp special. The lobster and shrimp where in a sauce that was a little too salty. The crowd here is generally in the late 40's+ so don't expect a cool hip vibe from this place. It's quiet and dark with a lot of warm colors, which I like for a steak place. The service has always bene excellent. The waiters are attentive but not intrusive. 

We signed up to receive a free dinner on our birthdays and I got the voucher for a free prime rib dinner with a potato and salad to be used Monday - Thursday anytime during the month of my birthday, yesterday. Woo hoo!"}
{"text":"Steak (Chicago style Ribeye rare) was 5 stars. Patrick, our bartender, 5 stars. Mushrooms left a little to be desired (high quality but plain). The steak was definitely the highlight of the meal, as it  ought to be. Charred on the outside, rare on the inside--yumm! The casual ambience was nice and we loved our experience. Drinks were great as well. UPDATE: After several visits to this location, I have finally experienced a mistake by the staff. We were seated and a server didn't attend to us for 5 minutes after being seated. My review stays at 5 stars because of how they handled it. The server was extremely kind and apologized. The reality is, it really wasn't a big deal at all. However, it was for them. The Manager comped us dessert and an after dinner drink without us asking. Our server Al made us feel as VIP's. Rock on Keg! You're awesome! This is why we come to the Keg every time we visit Toronto."}
{"text":"My husband and I had our first date here, and he later proposed here as well, so The Keg holds a special place in my heart, and we come back for all of our special occasions. We have been married 5 years and still love to request \"our\" table. We visited last week for my birthday dinner, and one of the perks is the free birthday entree they send you if you sign up via email. The food never disappoints, and I love the drink selections. My steak came out well done when I had requested medium, and our server Gentry was quick to bring me a new plate, perfectly cooked this time. Not only was Gentry's service impeccable, but the manager Kelly took care of my dinner and extended my free birthday meal for another month, and sent us dessert on top of everything. I have visited other locations and this one is hands down the best when it comes to service and food quality. We will continue to be loyal patrons for many years to come!"}
{"text":"Service SUCKED, food quality SUCKED, with tip well over 100...went to Durants today & LOVED IT"}
{"text":"The thing I really enjoy about The Keg is that it is always consistent with food quality!  Our waiter was attentive as always.  The filet's which everyone at the table ordered was tender and flavorful.

If you like a great steak with consistency attached you can not go wrong with  The Keg."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of The Keg.  I had not been one in a few years but was very happy with my meal here a couple weeks back.  This location is located very close to YYZ.  I had a sirloin that was top notch.  In fact, I had a steak at a fancy local place the night before, and the Keg blew them away.  We had a couple of cocktails that were well made and some wine that complimented our meal.  Our server was stellar, and I wish I could remember her name, as I would give her a call out.  Anyway, if I am looking for a steak by Pearson, I will be back.  You should feel free to check out this location too.  Thanks Keg!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for her birthday, and we usually do. The Keg used to represent the best value for quality in steakhouses. Sure, there are others where the food is better, the ambience is more posh (if you even care for that) and the prices are higher, therefore everything is better. But this was the place.

And frankly, it's gotten worse every time we go. Our last visit was a chore. From the very start, the hostess' contrived greeting. Asking how our day is going, what we're up to tonight, are we doing anything fun, blah, blah, blah. Pretending you care is awful. It's patronizing. You don't know us. Now, I don't fault her. She is supposed to do that, because some idea person thinks it's good. It's annoying. A genuine greeting with a smile, thanking us for coming in, wishing us to enjoy our time and meal there. That's fine.

And this over the top, in your face experience was pervasive through the entire night.

We could not go more than 60 seconds without our waiter, another waiter, the manager, the water pitcher guy (refilling a glass that is nearly full) interrupting us. At one point, we just stared at one another in disbelief of how ridiculously often we were being interrupted at our table for no reason. I am not out on a given night with my wife to talk to YOU.

Now, the food. I order a steak, medium rare, it comes medium well. F- from that point forward, because we are there to eat steak. I ate a few bites and did not finish it. The sides were poorly cooked. I had vegetables that reminded me of steam-in-the-microwave-bag and they were cold and nasty. The only reason I did not send my food back is because my wife asked me not to and it was her night, so I obliged.

One star reviews are for places that don't even try. It's two stars for trying, but only two for terrible food and constant interruptions."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and always had a good meal and experience. Price wise I would say its a little bit more than Outback but not much and the meal will be better guaranteed. I usually get the prime rib with mashed potatoes and vegetables, I leave with a happy belly every time. I start off with a shrimp cocktail which is tasty also. I have to say this place is better than most I have tried including Shulas. The place itself is warm and inviting with a modern look inside, dress nice and enjoy."}
{"text":"Amazing!! My husbands steak was a little bit under cooked to his liking and they were so amazing about making sure it came back how he liked! Service is unbelievable!! Highly highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"This place sucks bad food and over priced you can you get better steaks at Texas Road House and for half the price I would never eat here again"}
{"text":"Amazing. Amazing meal. Amazing service. Amazing drinks. Amazing ambiance. Loved my visit there.

Sat at the bar but had a full meal. Our server was attentive and friendly without being intrusive. My old fashioned was good but no single rock, which made me sad, but again I'm spoiled when it comes to old fashioned drinks.

I had a center cut filet topped with four massive shrimp tempuras and a side of mashed potatoes. My gosh, that was amazing!!! So much flavor, and great quality food.
Didn't try deserts but wouldn't doubt they'd be amazing.

I will certainly go back!"}
{"text":"Good restaurant but the side selection needs revamping. It's mostly all starches.  Baked pot, twice backed pot, french fries, veggies. I ordered a 7 oz bacon wrapped filet with veggies and asked if I could have the quinoa salad that came with a fish entree. Veggie medley was by far the best that I've had anywhere. They were very colorful and fresh. The quinoa salad was also an excellent choice, but they will charge an extra $3 because it isn't a regular side item listed on the menu.  The filet was cooked to perfection as I ordered it medium, just could have used a little more seasoning on it. Service was great ask for Jay or Harrison. They both good great care of our table."}
{"text":"As for chain restos, the Keg is a good happy hour go to. The happy hour may be limited but what they offer is substantial. I believe it's 5 or 6 small plates, and discounted house wines and draft beers from 4pm to 7pm. I usually work until 6pm on Fridays and the Keg is a 15 min drive from work, so, it makes a good hh meeting spot for my friends and I. I gotta compliment them on the Keg Dogs which is a hh item. It's served as 3 small hot dogs or the hot dog version of sliders topped with sweet chili. It's quite tasty and can be filling depending on your appetite, have a glass of wine or two, and it's a great start to a Friday evening."}
{"text":"A great place, nice ambience. Very expensive. On our first visit, the ribeye steak and salmon  was great. But But on our second visit, the steak was not cooked right. We also had the tuna and it was bland. But they were really busy and that's why it took long time to get the food too. Avoid going there on the weekend."}
{"text":"All i could say for this place was just eh. My boyfriend and i are pescetarians, so when we saw on their menu all of their lobster & fish, we were excited. The lobster was okay. Good, but not the best i have ever had. Especially for the price of the restaraunt. I would honestly compare this restaurants lobster to Red Lobsters. I will never understand why upscale restaraunts charge so much for their food. We left the place still hungry after spending $100. I don't know if everything is priced because of the \"experience\" or \"service\" , but even that was mediocre. It was good, but i will not be returning. Even for a special occasion. Maybe they get good reviews for their steaks."}
{"text":"I visited The Keg during the work week, after work. Great happy hour specials. I sat at the bar. Not crowded, pleasant atmosphere. Noise at a minimum. There were two baristas who were both very attentive to the customers. 

Food came quickly. Each dish was excellent prepared and presented. You have to try the bacon scallops! What a nice entry to the main dish!!  Amazing!"}
{"text":"Had a very enjoyable dinner last night.  Very attentive service.  Perfectly cooked filet and prime rib.  There was an over abundance of asparagus and other side veggies. Good wine by the glass selection.  I enjoyed the Caesar dressing!  Great flavor.  The croutons were not bad but added nothing but crunch.  They could have had some S&P but even better if they carried the garlic.  The bread was ok but not remarkable. Just a very pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"The food was good the Service was Pretty Average/borderline BAD! Sat at the Bar and the Bartender completely ignored me. Had to move to the a table and complain to get service . And the sad part is the place wasn't full. I dont know if they are just short staffed or have the Wrong Staff but if they had better workers I would have nothing else negative to say. The waitress was ok, but the only customer focused staff was the Hostess. I ordered the baked Brie and the Prime rib both items were quite tasty. The manager apologized and gave me $10 off my order but I still left annoyed. Why do I have to Jump around the room to get service? I Don't think I'll be back but if you like good food and don't mind average to almost bad service , this place is ok . I suppose."}
{"text":"It was our 1 year anniversary so my bf made reservations to come here. Neither of us have ever been so why not give it a try!? Once we told them our name we were happily greeted and directed to our seats. They had a happy anniversary card waiting for us which was sweet. Everything sounded amazing and my bf suggested the 8oz pecan sirloin with garlic potatoes. He ordered 7 oz bleu cheese filet and veggies. We also ordered a spinach salad and split that. Words don't describe the service and the food! They brought us out a mocha Oreo billy m. pie as a surprise as well. Blanca was our waitress and we had high praises for her when the manager came over. All in all a highly competitive steakhouse with your traditional Scottsdale restaurants. I'd bypass them any day to come back to the keg! Keep up the great service and amazing food!"}
{"text":"Our second visit to The Keg was on New Year's Eve.  Our first was sometime during the summer for happy hour.  It was one of those days that was seriously 113 degrees or so and I remember when I walked in to the bar I couldn't see anything.  It was so dark.  Normally I like that, but I had a hard time finding my husband.  I was thrilled when I put my hand on the right man.  My next thought was how much I liked the seating in the bar.  You can sit at the bar, they have high tops, they have cozy little seats along one wall, they have long tables for groups, and they have comfortable leather chairs along the front windows and by the fireplace.  Love the bar area.  

That visit we sat at the bar and had mojitos and shared an app and the bone-in ribeye.  Had an excellent time all around.

New Year's Eve is my husband's birthday as well, and this year he wanted to come back to The Keg for dinner.  This time we sat at one of the high tops and Kennedy took great care of us.  We ordered the calamari app and 2 of the bourbon maple martinis to start.  The calamari ($11) is great.  Nice and lightly fried and they have a few fried red bell peppers and jalapenos throughout for added flavor.  Enjoyed that a lot.  The drinks are very nice and made with Woodford Reserve, I just didn't think they were a great value at 10 bucks apiece.  More like $7 or $8.

He ordered the bone-in ribeye ($36 - 20 oz) again along with the twice-baked potato.  I'm convinced that is a perfect meal.  5-star all around.  Steak was a perfect med rare and the potato was just delicious with its rich buttery, bacony flavor.  I ordered the chicken and ribs ($28) with a side of vegetables instead of the fries and slaw.  There was nothing exciting or interesting about this meal.  Very generic flavors and the ribs were not very tender.  I wish I would have gotten something else.  Next time I'll probably go back to getting a steak.  With my meal I had the Angry Orchard ginger apple cider and that was delicious.  Mr. M ordered a glass of old vine zin to have with his steak.  That was very nice as well.  Total after tax, before tip was $121.08.  We will definitely go back to The Keg, but as we get to know the menu I'm learning what to avoid.  Great place overall."}
{"text":"Been here plenty of times, the food is always amazing! Our server Max was friendly, almost too friendly.  My mom ordered a second drink when our entrees were brought out, felt like Max dropped the ball since he didn't get the drink out to our table until we were finished eating.  Being part of the service industry, I always thrive on everyone working as a team, but I didn't see anyone helping each other, the chef walked through the dining room, and where I work it's to engage with guests, here it looked like a break from expo since we never seen him stop at a table? Max, try to read your guests better, some people love to be engaged by there server and some prefer less engagement, you were kind, but it was way overdone."}
{"text":"Came here for my Birthday dinner. They do have the greatest Birthday deal in town for sure. 
If you sign up on their website, they will send you a certificate for $25.00 off one of the best dinners you will ever have.
So we got the full works, starters, dinners, a bottle of wine and dessert.
French onion soup to start. Fantastic, we have been here a few times before and knew this was a winner.
Next I had the steak and Crab legs, and T the Filet mingon and lobster. Also wonderful. The bread was even good at this place.
After a wonderful dinner,we thought we would have dessert. Major dissapointment!
I got the chocolate Brownie with Ice Cream. It was a cheap Ice Cream, almost like an Ice milk, and the Brownie had no flavor. T got the Key lime pie. 
She said it tasted like she made it herself from a keebler pie crust.

She gave me a taste and it was awfully sweet,Both came with canned whipped cream.
It was a wonderful dinner just spoiled by the dessert.
Next time eat everything just not the dessert portion of it. Just skip it.
Our experiance was good other wise. Our server was a little pre occupied with the table next to us. She knew them( one of them worked there or used to). So she was busy talking to them. luckily we were not in a hurry. 
Still a good place, been here a few times and will come back for sure."}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated our 25th Anniversary at the Keg Gilbert tonight. We made a reservation for 6:30 and commented on our momentous occasion. We were seated right away and it was busy. Our waiter was prompt to greet us and take our drink order as well as ask what brought us in. My husband glowed when he said we are celebrating 25 years of marriage.  We were then rushed through ordering and then dinner...bread, salads, dinner, check. We were done in 45 minutes. We have celebrated at The Keg before and never felt rushed. In the past they also brought us a special dessert. Not tonight. Just a rushed dinner. We won't be celebrating future special occasions here. My filet was good, but not mouth melting tender as I remember. So many other great options for a great steak and customer service. Sadly disappointed."}
{"text":"Most people know what the Keg is about, so I won't go into much detail. This location delivers what a Keg should: a reliable, quality steak dinner with great service and ambience. They've never dropped the ball on the quality of steak, and always get my request of medium-rare each time. You know what you're in for, but that isn't a bad thing. There's a reason virtually every Keg thrives since the chain does a terrific job at quality control and standardized experience across the franchises. Bramalea Keg is another notch in their belt."}
{"text":"Terrific food and relaxing environment. Prime rib is exceptional, only downside is they aren't open for lunch."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised how nice the atmosphere and food was!  Had the baseball sirloin and it was succulent and juicy without being too salty or overly spiced.  Service was exceptional and attentive.  Recommend to go again!"}
{"text":"I took my wife out for our anniversary dinner here.  This was the first time for both of us.  The restaurant is very clean and you get a nice homey feel inside.  They have a nice sized patio if you care to eat outside.  We came in around 8:45 on a Friday night and we were seated promptly.  I started out with a Pacifico beer and my wife had a Belini from the bar.  We started out with an order of crab cakes and Mushrooms Neptune.

The Crab Cakes were very good and were filling.  You get 2 to an order and a side of their house tartar sauce that was a great accompaniment.  The Mushrooms Neptune is a mixture of cream cheese & crab stuffed inside mushrooms and baked.  These were really good as well.  You get 6 to an order.  A dinner roll came with it and I'm not sure why?  It was a plain ol' dinner roll, no butter or anything.  It really had no purpose of being there really.

For dinner I ordered the N.Y. Strip with a twice baked potato and added a lobster tail to the meal.  The steak was prepared perfectly (I ordered medium) and seasoned the way a steak should be.  The lobster tail was succulent with the drawn butter and the twice baked potato did not disappoint either.  My wife had the 10 oz. prime rib dinner (medium) with a twice baked potato and onion strings and that was out of the park as well.

The service was first class and at the end of our meal, the manager came over with 2 complimentary glasses of champagne to celebrate our anniversary and I thought that was a nice touch too.  The Keg won me over and I would have no reservations going back.  The prices are a little higher than other chain steakhouses but you'll find out quickly why and it's not a bad thing.  When my father-in-law or parents come out to visit, I will definitely treat them to a wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"Finally great steakhouse arrived!
Excellent service, perfect filet minion.
Ask medium done and it was exactly done. 
Thank you!"}
{"text":"Service was amazing and so was the food. We ordered without really paying attention to cost and I was amazed at how inexpensive everything was based on the quality. I will definitely be returning soon."}
{"text":"Sorry only mediocre.  Waitress was excellent.  Mortons night before.   My 2 pound lobster was only a pound and a quarter.  Wife salmon was good.  A little pricey for the meal."}
{"text":"Ladies at the front were super nice, made my day. My server was also really personable, I think his name was Ros? The environment is very cozy, definitely good for larger parties. The patio with the fireplace its also really nice, good for winter. But, for the rest I'm not impressed. Service was SUPER slow. I waited a long time in between salad/entree/dessert. But, I still tipped my waiter well, probably not his fault. Steak quality was good but not amazing. I got the filet mignon wrapped in bacon topped with lobster topped with asiago cheese. For a filet mignon price that compares to Flemings, it needs to match their quality. They're also rated in the same category. Fries kinda' dry, not bad but not great. Salad was good. Larger portions for sure. The browne Sunday was good but again... something you would get at BJs or Chilli's nothing special.

Again, I went to Flemings a couple of nights ago so I am comparing it to a higher up competitor but I spent the same amount of money for one person. So either lower your prices or up your quality guys."}
{"text":"Nice upscale dining.  Great service and well done food.  Great selection b/w steak, chicken, and some fish.  Well coursed and a great place to sit, eat, and talk with family and friends."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to The Keg in Chandler for Thanksgiving dinner ended up they had a full menu so had steak instead of turkey.  Our waiter was Max who was a wonderful young man and did an outstanding job.  This was our 5th visit I believe and never been disappointed.  The ladies are delightful and very helpful. Recommend this place highly. Our bill was $100 including 3 drinks, dessert and coffee.  Cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"If  I had to describe the Keg to someone who hasnt been there before I would say its a step below a Ruths Cris. The food quality is great and service is great its just the little touches that make the difference. I have been going to the Keg for over 5yrs and never once had a bad experience. A few times they have over cooked or under cooked my steak or filet however they always took it back and fixed it, one time they even comped the meal for us since we had a few issues. Some of my favorite dishes are the Santa Fe Chicken Dip, the New York or the Filet both topped with their Bleu Cheese crust (its more of a bleu cheese and roasted garlic crust) and then whenever they have their Dungeness crab specials those are always good."}
{"text":"For the price point and how fancy this place is supposed to be, they didn't live up to my expectations.  I arrived around 7:45 and they were already out of prime rib so I opted for the baseball cut steak. The steak came out medium rare and was very good, tender and flaverful. The vegetables that came with it were terrible, they were undercooked and dry . If you're going to cook vegetables please sauté them, steam them or bake them. do something other than throw them in the microwave to justify the quality you you purport to have.  The service was ok nothing great nothing bad."}
{"text":"We came here last night for my girlfriends Birthday.Lots of parking as well, we got one front and center.  It was really good.
First time at this location.        We were greeted right away and given a very nice booth for 3. For a starter we got the fried Calamri,excellent!  WIne was good as well as the martini's//. 
Dinner was fabulous,we all 3 got a different steak and all 3 were cooked perfect and tasted great!  The bread could be better but, they do use real butter.
Our waiter was Matt and he explanied all things on the menu,another plus. We had a great evening. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place always keeps the bar set high!! My wife and i have been here twice, and are always very pleased with their service! It is NOT possible to ever be disappointed
here!

Baseball sirloin, oscar style is how i roll :)"}
{"text":"Exceptional staff service and food. It's been awhile since I've had my socks knocked off by feet. 

Not a fan of the keg from previous experience but this location has gained my respect for the brand itself again. 

Giving the staff at this location a big round of applause."}
{"text":"I know the company you go to dinner with makes a big difference in your experience while dining, but even though all of the company with me has been wonderful, I have enjoyed eating each of my meals I have ordered at  the keg. My husband and I have eaten here many times. I never order the steak but always try something else. My husband always orders a steak and they are just fine.
It is a wonderful place to go for a nice glass of wine and a simple dinner. The service is good and there are different places to sit like the lounge, main dining area or the patio.  We love to go in the winter and get a seat on the patio to talk and look at the stars over our meal and a good glass of red wine. Confortable and romantic."}
{"text":"Love this place! Consistently delicious food, nice ambiance and friendly servers. My favorite is the filet mignon and garlic mashed potatoes. The creme brûlée is also divine. A little pricy, yes, but worth it."}
{"text":"My well braised medium-rare steak was not at all braised and so rare it was like rubber. One Caesar salad had no grated Parmesan cheese while the other had a healthy portion. The hot fudge Brownie (with caramel) dessert had NO hot fudge and NO caramel. The server was friendly but too busy for us to try to remedy the subpar food prep."}
{"text":"I went here for happy hour and they had a good amount of beer specials. The staff was friendly, the atmosphere was very nice. I would probably come back here agae."}
{"text":"Pretty good food and the price is right for the portion size. If you're looking for steak and do not want to break the bank then give it a try."}
{"text":"I have been back 3 times since my last visit and can easily say my last experience isn't the norm. And I haven't seen that waiter since so perhaps he found a job outside of customer service?? 

I talked to the manager and they were so amazing at handling the situation. Seriously major kudos! I probably wouldn't have been back if it weren't for them and it's now become a spot we frequent. The service has been great ever since as well. 

The last 2 times I went I had the pecan crusted steak which is great. My friends all swear by the French onion soup and order it everytime. I'll have to try it next time.

We came in recently again as a group for a going away party for one of my BFFs. We ordered 3 desserts- the crème brulee, the coffee ice cream pie and the brownie sundae. BEST BROWNIE SUNDAE. We all ended up not really even finishing the other desserts because they didn't even compare to that one. 

So this is what you should order:
French onion soup
pecan crusted steak
brownie sundae"}
{"text":"Went to The Keg for an early Valentines day on the 12th.  We were greeted at the door  5 times! (over-kill in my opinion), but at least the staff is making an effort.  I was wearing a black dress, and the hostess switched out my white napkin for a black one to avoid any \"fuzzy's\" transfering to my dress.  I thought that was a nice touch.  Our server was knowledgable and friendly.  The food was delicious!  Baked goat cheese appetizer is the best,  I order it every time.  I strongly recommend anyone that hasn't eaten here yet...Needs to."}
{"text":"Ive been going to Keg restaurants for years in the state of WA and in AZ. This has to be the nicest one. Staff is very friendly, yet professional. We dined outdoors as we didnt have reservations. It was a cold Dec night but the overhead heaters made it comfortable. The outdoor patio is well done. My wife had chicken n garlic potatos and I had chicken breast and ribs. Prior to our meal we were given two small loafs of hot bread. Bread was not the typical sourdough that we were accustom to at the Keg, but it was still good. My wife meal was ok, a 2 rating. She had the gravy sauce that came with it on the side. Garlic potatos were not very garlicly. Kind of bland.
My meal; Chicken (1 pc) n ribs was not a very good value at $28.00. Ribs were more bone than meat. For both meals it was $53.00. Add $10.00 for tip total was $63.00. Service was 4star, but the food value dropped the overall rating to a 3."}
{"text":"I stood outside and pondered, why am I here when I'm not a beer guy?  Easy answer: Family meal. (And for the record, I married into a wonderful family so meals like this are always fun).

We buried The P's mom earlier this week and we still had a number of family friends in town.  Decided to do a group meal and since it was a school night, I wouldn't have to cook-we'd go out.  That's a win right there.

I had been to The Keg one other time years ago for a Happy Hour and had enjoyed the apps but this was my first time in the dining room.  The Resturant is a step above Outback and maybe a step below Mortons or Maestros (in price at least for the latter). They offer a full bar and a number of signature cocktails. I went with the burnt orange Manhattan and it was delicious (I had two just to compare :).  Extensive wine list kept The Princess and her sister happy.

I ordered from The Keg Classic menu.  Petite filet (medium rare), asparagus, mac and cheese, and a wonderful wedge salad. I had been to Ocean Prime the night before and the filets were nearly identical-perfect little pieces of deliciousness. Whereas OP generously decorated the plate with three asparagus spears, The Keg loaded me down with at least 8 oz of asparagus-bonus!  The meal also came with amazing freshly baked sourdough break-warm enough to melt the butter.  

We shared key lime pie, crème brûlée, and a ice cream/fudge/nut concoction for dessert.  Great meal all the way around.  Service was fantastic, meal value was as expected and I'm looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Not bad, but not very good. 

First, I why does \"The Keg\" not have any beer to speak of? I was dumbfounded to learn they had three beers available. 

The service was very attentive and both the hostess and our server were great, but everything else was middle of the road at best. The mixed drinks were poorly done and the food was nothing special."}
{"text":"Party of 7 went on a Thursday night.  We chose the Keg because of previous good experiences.    It seems they have implemented some cost saving measures lately and the experience was noticeably less quality.   Service was good, but food was very slow.  It took almost 1 full hour to get food.     Two of the items had to be sent back to kitchen because they were incorrect.  Something very minor, but noticeable, is they no longer have mouthwash or mints in the bathroom.  Keg used to be top notch, but they seem like they are cutting corners."}
{"text":"Pretty good filet, cooked perfectly. Twice baked very good and not dry. Good veggies and Caesar salad was nice with not too much dressing:). Bread good.  Wine list very average and stem wear was rather poor and industrial. Server was young energetic college type. 

All in all a very good quality steak place."}
{"text":"This place was not good. Only redeeming thing was the waitress. We went here for Restaurant Week and ordered the Prime Rib Oscar. Prime Rib had a very odd texture and it was hard to cut with the steak knife - and just way too much gelatinous fat. Also, not sure how bearnaise sauce and red wine au jus go together, but they don't. The combo made me feel like my palate was coated in a thin layer of vomit. Scallops and shrimp were overcooked. The earlier Wedge had very thick chunks of bleu cheese that tasted imitation at best. Twice half baked potato was decent. Desserts were uninspiring. Very obvious when someone defrosts a frozen dessert that comes in a package and tries to hide it with cherry topping. Just bad. Flemings is 10x better than this place.

Also, they have an orange slice martini that is reminiscent of a sidecar cocktail, but I would have preferred a sidecar. This cocktail was too sweet. It was like drinking a sugary, boozy glass of orange juice whilst watching your kids unwrap Christmas presents. Had that kind of feel."}
{"text":"The place: This place is located in a shopping plaza or shopping center (whichever way you want to call it). Is right next to Macarroni & Grill so if you find one you find the other. It was a bit difficult to find this place with the gps because for some reason the address on google and yelp was the address for the shopping plaza so I had to drive a few times around this place before I found it. 
The inside is divided into 2 sections. The bar and the dinning area. I personally preferred the dinning area as it is more \"personal\". It has plenty of booths and regular tables too. 
The food: I ordered the prime rib as it was recommended by our waiter and husband ordered the new york strip. My dish came with mash potatoes, onion rings (thin sliced) and some beef juice. I ordered my prime rib medium and it was as if I was cutting butter. It was super tender and juicy. It came with a lot of fat so if you are not into that then skip this dish (see picture). My husband loved his New York Steak and even told me that it was better than my prime rib. 
The Service: it was a bit slow but our waiter was extremely nice and made sure that our dining experience was top notch. 
Overall, this place is good if your are craving a niece piece of steak. Of course, you can't go to this place and expect to pay longhorn prices. This is going to cost a bit more than that but is totally worth it."}
{"text":"Good quality, simply prepared steaks. 

If you are in the area, there is no better steak to be had in this neighbourhood. 

Pro tip: get the billy miner pie. its so simple and so good."}
{"text":"First time at The Keg. Five of us arrived at 7:30 but we had reservations so we were seated right away. It was about 3/4 full on a Saturday. 

We all ordered steaks plus we got a glass of wine, a bottle of wine, three desserts and a coffee. I was okay with all of that but $7 for coffee?  I thought Starbucks was pricey. 

The steaks were all cooked as requested, which is often hard to get. The side veggies were extremely scant but the 'accompaniments' were large. It was a satisfying meal and, including tip it came to $50 per person. 

Recommendations: Bleu Cheese Filet (lots of cheese); Sirloin Oscar, (topped with shrimps and scallops); creme brûlée (huge)."}
{"text":"My bf and one of our friends had gone out to dinner thinking we would grab something casual and watch the Coyotes play at \"The Keg\" ..... we were VERY wrong about the atmosphere of this restaurant!! With a name like \"the Keg\", we assumed sports bar (we should have looked it up on Yelp first....) and we were dead wrong as we walked into a white linen tablecloth restaurant and NOT a sports bar!  We ended up sitting in the lounge/bar area though because, well, we DID want to watch the Coyotes' game!  Our service started off horrendous ... you would have thought we were a group of 14 years olds after a school dance the way our server didn't want to wait on us.  I'm not sure if she was just super busy or ditzy or what but I was pretty irritated since instead of some casual sports bar, we were now paying $25 for a steak and $10 for martinis!  After we hadn't seen our server for a good 10-15 minutes and then she botched our drink order, the manager had stopped in to see how we were doing.  I was honest and said our server had been inattentive so we were kind of frustrated.  Oh my god did he make things right.  I felt bad for the server because he obviously went to talk to her but then we had the manager and the server checking in on us to the point, I was actually slightly embarassed for so much attention.  The manager absolutely made our experience a complete 180 from our first 20 minutes and I was very thankful .... let's just say, she deserved her 20% tip by the end of our meal :)"}
{"text":"They have the BEST steaks. Tender and flavorful. I like the veggie mix. The potatoes and rice my husband gives a thumbs up. My only disappointment is the salad. I'm not sure why but the salads seem just so-so. I love salads and cant put my finger in it but they don't quite hit the yummy spot. Bread is good. appreciate greatly that you can get the filet mignon without bacon (why mess with the flavor if a great steak). The coup de gras is the key lime pie. I'm not a huge key lime person but there's is TO DIE FOR, so rich and creamy. As for the other desserts, we have tried a few and they've been delicious (except the mango creme brûlée which was bland). All in all, our favorite steak spot locally."}
{"text":"Did not have a great experience at the location in Phoenix.  Location in Dallas is a five star.  Ordered three appetisers.  So-so and expensive."}
{"text":"Service was as awesome as the steak. These guys hustle and make sure that everything is great. This is truly a family favorite. Normally the bread is hot and soft and chewy but tonight wasn't as great as it normally is. Luckily the service and rest of food were great.  Tried this again for my birthday and service was awesome. Our server made some recommendations and they were great. As usual food was great. Love their steaks."}
{"text":"Incredible food and service, such an amazing dining experience! We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"* Fantastic food!
* Service started out good, but for some reason our waiter disappeared. I had to flag someone down to pay our check.  
* Prices were high, but the sea bass was worth every $$"}
{"text":"I love this place. The steak is amazing. The escargots is amazing. The bacon wrapped scallops are amazing! lol... I'm always a happy camper when I eat here. 

The atmosphere is intimate, the service is great and while the prices are a bit high, the food is well worth it.

If you have family/friends coming in form out of town this is a place to take them. I also recommend this for birthday dinners."}
{"text":"Ok first off i am usually not dissapointed easily but WOW what a horrible experiance customer service is everything 1. the waiter did not offer us drinks until we ordered our food he got my mothers order wrong and charge us  extra for the correct sides i had to ask for bread, he came by the table and asked if we needed anything i said yes can u please remove my plate (he wasnt holding anything) he told me to hold on that he would be back later, why ask then? Once we were done with our meal he gave us a box n walked away ive dinned at the keg before our waiters always offered to box everything up then i asked to please see the dessert menu since he did not offer it i had mentioned to him that it was my mothers birthday he did not wait or make suggestions 8 min later he took our dessert order. I loved my past experiances at the keg but this one was left a bad taste in my mouth, other than tat the food was  good i probably will just never go to this paticular one....one bad apple shouldnt ruin the bunch"}
{"text":"First time here in July 2016.  The restaurant is a little dark, but not so dark you can't see the menu or meal. I guess the bar area is pretty dark. I got the filet with mushrooms & double baked potato. Oh...plus a garden salad! The salad was big & had lots of nice ingredients in it. The steak had a great flavor & cooked exactly as I asked.  Hubby enjoyed his blackend filet, mashed potatoes, and asparagus ($5 extra).  They do charge extra for the blackend style($2).  Eric was a great server & did an awesome job.  We will be back even though it is on the more expensive side. No drinks, meal for 2 was $75."}
{"text":"The food was delicious!!! The service was exceptional.  My son has a nut allergy and the manager came by to explain how they take allergies seriously and the precautions they take.  Excellent experience at this restaurant.  The server was great!!!"}
{"text":"Had the prime rib and twiced baked potato. Was raised in Vegas...The PR was not \"Vegas Hotel\" quality but it was good and very tender. My guest had a steak with all the seafood on top and we shared a Lobster appetizer. We both agreed we would come back! Our server was a little gal who was preggers. She was great and made some good recommends for these first timers! I am a gourmet cook and had the pleasure of sitting close to the kitchen. The kitchen ran smoothly (very professional), spic and span ,and was a joy to watch. 

Overall: Pricey but good especially for occasions!

{"text":"Had dinner there just the other day had to send the steak back 3 times. Horrible took over an hour . Had to order chicken and shrimp because they couldn't get the steak medium rare. Manager said he was sorry over and over. Me and my friend were very hungry it was ridiculous that we had to order chicken when we really wanted steak. You think if it taking that long they were to offer free sodas at least. Nope not a chance I'll never go there again"}
{"text":"Fantastic service deserves to be recognized. Thank you Pat and Luke at the main bar for your hospitality and friendly service. When in Toronto I will be coming back again! Cheers!"}
{"text":"For not being a big fan of fatty meat the prime rib is great. They do have the best im sure. The sweet potato fries are great and the NY strips are very good as well. Great service and dinner!"}
{"text":"I have to say this place was recommended to me. I came in with an open mind that I was trying something new.

I was greeted at the door- thumbs up.

Sat at the bar, mind you this is a bar...and I was there for drinks and appetizers. I was a little disappointed. The bar was seriously dark and you had to use the light on your cell phone to help light up the menu's or use the candle that was propping up the menu to give you some back light to read the menu. This may have been romantic had I been seated in the dining area and on date. But I was thirsty and wanted and drink to top off my wonderful day Saturday out and about in Scottsdale.

The place had TV's to occupy the view. Otherwise on the walls were a bunch of art work of ladies legs or a couple embracing. Not sure what the theme of this art work was supposed to represent. I know that this is a Steakhouse and Bar but the pictures on the wall for some reason didn't quite fit image for me. 

Drinks prices and appetizer prices were a bit on the high end. Although they did taste good. 

The bar area also had a lounge like area with a couch and cozy setting. 

This place would be worth a try again sometime."}
{"text":"Back to The Keg to celebrate my birthday. Had the 7 oz filet medium rare with twice baked potato, classic comes with salad plus sauteed mushrooms and grilled vegetables. Love the hot sour dough bread served with dinner. Everything was very good. Didn't have room for dessert."}
{"text":"The Keg is a franchise and is my FAVORITE restaurant! This location in particular is slightly sub par in my book. On multiple occasions I've had to send food back because it just didn't taste right. On a good note I hosted my birthday dinner here and had a fairly large party. Our two servers were very accommodating and were able to keep up with our cocktail orders. Very fun place."}
{"text":"My favorite place in the whole world! I love coming here for date nights or just a night with girlfriends. My husband even proposed to me here at this location. The food is always delicious, the cocktails are to die for and the staff has always been super friendly! I enjoy the atmosphere and location. Truly one of the best places in town for dinner."}
{"text":"This Keg is located right near the south west corner of Dixon and Carlingview.  I live so close but really never paid much attention to the structure really ever being here.  I can tell it's been here for a while though.  This building is one of the \"old school\" Keg structures that has the feeling of being like a European chalet or something like that.  There is a similar old structure like this one near The West Mall and Bloor but that recently closed down and a new one opened at Sherway Gardens on the north side (new section).

Parking, I found a spot.  This place looked quite busy and it's in a busy place with the airport right there and all the hotels nearby.  Take into account we came on a Thursday evening on a long weekend (Friday was Canada Day) but there was no waiting for a table for 2.

We were seated in a small room near the back corner not at a booth but just a small table.  There was a large party in that room as well.  The lighting is dim and soft.  It's not that loud in that small room but the discussion the other table was having was loud enough to hear.  They were from Dallas don't you know... not hard to figure it out since we can hear their entire discussion.

We had been sitting for a while and not been served but somebody eventually asked us if Christina has been by to check on us yet.  I had said not yet.  She apologized and said she have her come right over and asked if we had wanted to order a drink?  I appreciate that Christina's colleague would help her out like that.  We did order drinks and eventually Christina came by.  We had a long enough time to go through the menu so I had ordered for us.  

I had asked for the 14oz prime rib and my wife had wanted the 6oz sirloin with seafood on the summer special menu.  I had also asked for escargot and a caesar to start.  Christina suggested that she would be able to combine the prime rib and the caesar into the classic meal so the salad would be included.  I had thought only the 10oz could be in the classic but she assured me she'd put it together.  

Our appetizers came out ahead of the meal as requested (I always say to start if I prefer it first, not to mention not all the plates would fit on this table for two) and we shared both.  The salad was fresh and had a generous amount of cheese.  We weren't offered fresh ground pepper come to think of it.  That would have been nice.  The escargot while decent weren't fabulous.  It's been a while since I last had this type of app, probably at Red Lobster and while it's not as salty or garlic buttery it still has a good taste but not as flavorful.

When our mains came the prime rib looked really good and really big.  The mashed potatoes seemed pretty bland though.  The side horsh radish wasn't as strong as I'd hope.  The cut of the prime rib was generous and it wasn't bad but it wasn't as good as others I've had elsewhere.  My wife enjoyed her steak.  She doesn't like blood at all so she usually asks for medium well.  I don't like it cooked so well.  I didn't try hers but she ate it all and she said it was good.

Overall this Keg location didn't seem that great to me.  While I really like the mansion location in the city this location didn't really impress me and while the service and attention was good the food was just at par on this particular evening for me.

It wasn't bad but it wasn't great either.  The last time I went out for a nice prime rib it was at Canyon Creek for Valentine's day and in my mind that was just a better overall experience and meal.  

I don't go to have 100 dollar meals that often but when I do I kind of expect them to be a bit better than every day type experiences.  This one was just OK."}
{"text":"I love, love, love the Keg!  I've been to this location as well as San Tan Village, Tempe Marketplace and Desert Ridge and have had nothing but exceptional food and service. I really like the atmosphere, it has that dark, cozy steakhouse feeling without being too stuffy or pretentious.  

We enjoyed an excellent  Halloween dinner here last night which included a \"Keg sized\" glass of Fetzer chardonnay, a margarita (very strong), the Keg Classic Dinner (ceasar salad, 7 oz filet wrapped in bacon, mixed vegetables and a loaded baked potato), bacon wrapped scallops (an appetizer that I ordered for my entree) and their fabulous bread with whipped butter, YUM!  Our server was very outgoing and friendly and offered suggestions as far as the menu.  The bill with tax and tip was $68, really an excellent value.

 Overall, a great meal and dining experience.  I will definitely be back and can't wait!"}
{"text":"The place smell amazing as we walked in.  Luckily we got to restaurant at 5:30 so we were able to get parking and a table for 3 with no problems.
The waiter, Sam was awesome. He comped us a deserve cause it was our first visit to Keg.
Bread was delicious with the whipped butter.
We had the special Tbone and the prime rib.  It was delicious.  We also had a child's meal of chicken fingers and fries.  All together it was $87.
The only negative was that our water was never refilled"}
{"text":"Very, very nice steak.  Great ambience; excellent wine list; superb service from John, our waiter (after we were finally seated - the hostess was evidently hanging out in the kitchen, and it took the Mgr to roust her back to the front so she could seat us) - overall a very nice meal.  We both ordered steak - Peppered NY Strip + Ribeye - and both were cooked exactly as asked for - the twice-baked potatoe was awesome and the bread was deliciously crusty and hot. The service was impeccable - our waiter John was spot-on throughout our entire meal - he was both attentive and efficient in a very subtle, non-invasive way - really, very good service.  John could teach Wait-staff Techniques101.  We agreed this was a great pick for a steakhouse."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner Friday night during happy hour.  We sat outside on the patio and it was a beautiful night out so that helped with the overall ambiance.  The HH wine was excellent. They gave huge pours and it was only $6 a glass. My husband had a HH shrimp dish which he liked.  We split a Filet with vegetables, shrimp and scallops.  I would say the food overall was good, can't really complain.  Our bill was around $57 and for all we ate, it was a great deal for a steak restaurant. What really wow'd me at this location was the service. I thought it was top notch, not a thing was forgotten and the execution was flawless, therefore they get 4 stars."}
{"text":"Walked in and was told \"to wait a minute while we check on a table\"....for just two!! Place is empty! Sat waiting for hostess to finish talking to her friends visiting her at work. No effort to \"look for a table.\" Managers that came to front allowed her to carry on, and they neither made an effort. Walked out and chose Red Robin next door, much better choice.
Zero stars if it allowed me to."}
{"text":"My family came here to celebrate my birthday. Don't worry, they don't sing. But they do give you a full size dessert to share and it was very good. From a cheeseburger to the filet our entrees were prepared just as we like them. We shared a Caesar salad which was good and the veggies served with our steaks were also good. The sirloin I had with shrimp and scallops was excellent. It came with mushrooms as did my husband's rib steak.
Service was excellent. It is on my list for future celebrations."}
{"text":"Came for Happy Hour ended up staying for dinner!

Awesome Happy Hour Drinks and appetizers! I had the orange martini (okay... maybe a few.. like 3 lol) and another one I cant remember (probably because of the 3 orange martinis!) . My friend and I also had the fried green beans.. they were delicious. I couldnt stop eating them! 

We then decided to stay for dinner and I had a sirloin with blue cheese and pecans. It was also very good. Service was great, table was decently quiet for a conversation, and prices were not bad considering the amount of alcohol consumed! Two of us.. 6+ martinis, 2 steak dinners, appetizers, bread.. $110 with tip."}
{"text":"This steakhouse delivers a great steak and wonderful atmosphere. I haven't had any negative experiences and the food has always been delicious!"}
{"text":"I was here a several weeks ago with my girlfriend.  We were seated promptly and the decor was nice.  Our waiter was fantastic and I enjoyed his beer recommendation.  We ordered surf and turf.  I thought it lacked a bit of seasoning, so it just didn't blow me away; but the food was still ok."}
{"text":"The ribeye is brilliant. Very good value in just oz per dollar; however they also age the beef and offer 2 infrequent choices for how you would like it cooked: blue rare on one end of the spectrum and Chicago style as an oddball.  Chicago means the outside will be charred and the inside will be whatever temp you want it.  I went for Chicago rare, and it was so amazing I didn't use the onion straws or sautéed mushrooms that come with it.  I also only had a tiny bite of my twice baked which was very good, but I couldn't spare the room since its a 20 oz cut.  The tempura snap peas and asparagus were light crisp and wonderful.  The bartender was great and did well with a basil gimlet that was sweeter than I usually allow, but the agave and elderberry went really well with the citrus.
Also, this place looks to require headshots from all staff when applying, but in addition to all being very attractive they all had their hustle on and were keepin the place moving.

Update: 2nd showing?  Still a mighty good steak, but much worse service.  The bartender was very concerned about closing and not so much serving me.  Guess they should've went farther than her headshot..."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to the Keg for our 4th anniversary. I've lived in the area for 8 years and have never been there. We were blown away from the time we entered until we left. Service second to none. Our server didn't continually bother us, but just seemed to know when we needed something. The food was amazing. If I had to find something bad to say it would be that a house salad does not come with the meal and must be purchased separately. Quiet atmosphere. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in at the Brampton mall looked around checked YELP for the closest steakhouse. Walked over and had a very enjoyable meal The waitstaff was incredibly friendly always smiling and helpful, great wine selection !!!"}
{"text":"the food here was excellent the prime rib was one of the best I have ever had  all seemed very well done,I was talked down on my wine selection lol typical steakhouse wine, I did not like the horseradish it was really sour ALMOST not fresh but that was it.
I did like the atmosphere but I hate being seated near the entrance too loud, our waiter was grreat and very attentive.
It was nice to just sit and relax with my honey."}
{"text":"Great happy hour. Best pours for wine. $6 for 9oz of J Lohr, yes please. Bacon wrapped Scallops are fantastic. Love the prime rib sliders too."}
{"text":"Living in Gilbert, and always doing my shopping at San Tan I have driven by this restaurant many times. Little did I know what a gem it was, until after reading reviews and going here as a family for one of my son's birthdays! The food was absolutely delicious! The best steaks that we'd all had in a long time and cooked perfectly as requested! In the past we'd always taken the whole family to places like Texas Roadhouse, and the food here was on a WHOLE higher level of quality with better flavors and cooked better than any place like that! I could tell that the cook really knew his way around a good steak and how to cook it as asked. The server was seriously phenomenal! I wish I could remember his name, but he was awesome! We had a couple children with us and although it's a nice place, they treated them really well with kids menus and even kid friendly snacks they bring out right away for them. On the expensive side, as for our group of six, with two only being kids meals, the bill was still over $200, after tip. This place would only be a place that I'd go for special occasions, but it was so worth it!!!"}
{"text":"The rib steak is awesome, so delicious! The waitress was very kind and nice.
Certainly, will come back next time in town."}
{"text":"Always a consistent choice for a steak and some drinks with friends. The Keg thrives on its consistency.. I sometimes wish the menu had more variety but i definitely crave it on a regular basis."}
{"text":"I came here with my family last night for dinner, and I was definitely satisfied with my experience.

We ordered the crab cakes for an appetizer, and they were absolutely delicious. I also got a caesar salad, which was very good, and the bread was warm and tasty. For my entree, I got the filet mignon, and it was cooked perfectly. Probably the best filet I've had.

The wait staff was very polite and knowledgable, and our waiter was more than willing to answer any questions we had. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"What an improvement!!

I did not think the food was very good the last 2 times I went (the last time I didn't bother to update).  Tried the happy hour again to find the chicken nachos much more edible - the chicken is still a bit salty but its on the border of salty and best seasoned chicken ever.  The mushroom cap appetizer is delicious, ESPECIALLY with some lemon squeezed on top.  The wings off the bar menu were delicious as well - 3 peppers or something, so its a low lingering hot that I do enjoy.

I think I will definitely come back.  Not sure for the pricier food, but the happy hour and apps are definitely much improved."}
{"text":"Love the bellini!!! Steaks are average....prices a lirttle high for what you get."}
{"text":"Not long ago the Keg near the intersection of Bloor and The West Mall shut down.  It was a completely old school location and structure (mansion type) not very different from the location near Carlingview and Dixon by the airport.

This Keg (replacement?) is a completely different scene altogether.  To go along with the completely new north section of Sherway Gardens comes two restaurants (Joey and The Keg) that while attached to the mall are not accessible from the indoor of the mall itself.  

The entrance for The Keg is actually closer to the Hudson's Bay side on the north side near the new garage's north side entrance that faces the Queensway side.  The footprint of the restaurant is quite large visually from the exterior.  While there's the main dining lounge on the main floor there's stairs and an elevator that lead to the 2nd floor which is a covered although exterior type patio, yet covered.  The east and north side of this structure are open air with a great view looking west and north.  You can see the mass of the Mississauga city center from the upper level.

So as far as the ambiance this new location is a whole new look and style from the old school Keg type locales.  I like the new look and it feels much more with the times.  

As far as the food goes it's kind of like how it was before which is not different and not great but not horrible either.  

I had ordered a prime rib large cut which is what I had just a few weeks back at the airport location.  For some reason this cut seemed much more cooked than I'm used to.  I thought it was going to be more rare but it wasn't.  It was still good though.  I like their prime rib and I always get a bit of whatever my wife doesn't finish so I was able to have half her filet the other day as well.  

The service was good here.  We were well looked after and by Cody.  When the weather's nice get a spot upstairs if you can.  It's much more open and the view is great.  Overall the experience at this Keg is good.  I like the new look and the new feel of this contemporary location.  With the exception of the mansion downtown I think this Keg is my new favorite location."}
{"text":"This place is always solid to scratch the itch for a steak at a non premium price tag.  The happy hour is great and I love the bar area.  Don't expect prime beef quality, because it's not a prime steakhouse.  The filet is just fine though and I think it's around 40 bucks.  I've had the ribs, and salmon also which were both great.  The only super petty criticism I have is the free chips in the bar aren't very good.  They are not salted or seasoned.  Other than that, the service has always been above average, and it is good enough we took our family here when they were in town.  We had 12 or 13 people and nobody left unhappy with what they ordered.  Classy atmosphere, great food, consistent on every level."}
{"text":"Good service but really bad food. We came with our kids and they ordered the kids burger sliders that tasted like they came right out of a freezer and put on a grocery store potato roll... My wife and I both ordered the keg burger and they both came out well done and had a rubbery, frozen patty feel. Surprisingly the worst Niger I can remember ordering in a long time. I have had steaks here before and they were ok, but the sides and other food we ordered were on point with Applebee's."}
{"text":"This is a perennial favorite of my husband and I. We love the atmosphere, the food, drinks and juicy slabs of beef we can choose from. Their patio also has a nice vibe to it when the weather cools off some, the fireplace prevents things from getting too chilly during our short fall and winter seasons. 

My favorite has always been the prime rib, medium rare almost to the outer edges with a generous helping of horseradish and au jus. I also can't eat here without the Mushrooms Neptune. We each get an order to avoid sharing."}
{"text":"Had a family going away dinner for my daughter (18), with my wife and son (11) as well. The food was excellent, starting with 4 shared appetizers Jumbo shrimp cocktail, calamari,  bacon wrapped scallops and escargot. My wife and I both had a fresh and tasty Ceasar Salad, followed by a filet and a bone in ribeye both cooked midrare and to perfection. The flavorful and juicy meat was scrumptious. Our meal including a few cocktails and a couple of glasses of wine ran about $65.00 each including a 20% tip. I am very happy to have found the Steakhouse about 5 miles from home. I shall return."}
{"text":"Service- 4 stars
Food- 3.5 stars
Food was good! Wedge salad was big enough to share, mushroom neptune were mushroom caps filled with cream cheese and a hint of crab- it was alright. The star was the Sirloin Oscar. Baseball cut sirloin topped with scallops and shrimp and bernaise sauce. SATISFYING! Steak was cooked perfect. Good value for your money. Beware, they do not have corkaging license so you are stuck with their wine list selection. Overall, great service, I would highly recommend it and I would go back if I'm in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Lovely restaurant with very good service. The filet mignon was tender and tasty, served with a delicious bernaise sauce. The top sirloin was also very good although I would not recommend the pecan and goat cheese topping. The topping is made with a heavy gravy that obscured the fine cut of the meat. Unless you're starving, skip the salad to save room for the wonderful veggie side dish. The mushrooms were delish!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Ok service. Been coming here for about a year and a half. Live right around the corner. If you come later and want to sit outside, be ready for the wait staff hour. They all sit outside and take up all the smoking tables and talk trash about the guests they had all day long. The waiter you have would rather hang with them than get what you need so be ready for the crappy service to follow. I have done what they do so it is what it is but they shouldn't be allowed to sit so close to the guests if they're going to complain as much. Just an idea."}
{"text":"The seasonal special was excellent and their filet was cooked to perfection. The waiter was very familiar with the menu and was able to easily provide recommendations based on input from us."}
{"text":"Check #426371 Party 4
Shane was a nice waiter, food ordered was appetizers and then 4 entrees.  As soon as the appetizers landed on our table the main course came out !  Seriously...then I had to give the look and ask for them to delay as we had not even 1 fork bite of APS.  Fish was salmon -ok,  the baked Seabass was fishy.  For $145 dinner not going back any time in the near future!"}
{"text":"Wife and I went to The Keg Restaurant to celebrate my birthday and we had a wonderful evening. Our waiter, Joel, was excellent in not only his attention to making sure our service was beyond reproach, but also gave us plenty of time between each course. I started with the lobster bisque and my wife had a caesar salad. We shared both and they were delicious. We each ordered the bacon wrapped filet mignon. Cooked perfectly and extremely tender. Great ambiance and a restaurant that will not disappoint you."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant but not too fancy. Quality of food is fantastic.  I do not think you could have a bad meal.  Our server Tara was so sweet, classy & attentive.  Can wait to go back."}
{"text":"We had Thanksgiving dinner at The Keg and normally I really like that restraint but not this time.  We had 3:30 reservations and did not receive any food until 5:00.  The food was tasteless, bland, not good.  I gave 2 starts because the staff worked so hard and were all extremely friendly.  Even the manager was serving drinks and running food.  But as for the food it self, we could of probably got a better dinner at Denny's."}
{"text":"I took my wife here for our anniversary and cannot say enough about our experience.  The food was fantastic, the ambiance was wonderful, but most importantly the service was over the top.  

Upon arriving, we were seated and after some polite conversation with the hostess, we mentioned that we were there for our anniversary.  A short while later, the hostess brought a \"Happy Anniversary\" card signed by a large number of the staff and thanked us for choosing their restaurant.  We've had very good experiences at restaurants but the staff at the Keg started by setting the standard higher right off.

The entire experience from this point on remained at the same high quality.  As of the time we left, we plan on coming back to the Keg every year for our anniversary but doesn't mean that we won't return for happy hour as often as possible.

Thank you for a wonderful anniversary!"}
{"text":"I've had a draft in here forever for The Keg, and I'm glad I waited until after a recent Happy Hour to post this. After an oft delayed flight back to PHX, I was famished; in an unusual twist of the usual: \"I dunno, what do you want?\" rhetoric, we both said, \"The Keg!\" when a trip to Lush at Chandler Mall was mentioned. 

We have been to The Keg several times for well executed steak/lobster dinners, enjoyed the food, service, and ambiance plenty, but it was never in my top \"must go\" picks. It is on the spendy side, but fun for special occasions or groups. We had an amazing dinner here with one of our HS buddies and his wife last year. 

We enjoy Happy Hours (HH) which offer tasty food, especially small plates to share: here we enjoyed each of the dishes we had, my favorite was the baked Brie ($6) and Scott loved the baked garlic shrimp ($4) HH is 4-7PM M-S with reverse from 10PM-closing, and all day Sunday. There are beer and wine specials, and a daily cocktail @ $5. The bar is dark and swanky with a fire place and couch, and lots of hi two and four tops. 

We are fans, and will return!"}
{"text":"Love love this place always great service! Food is amazing ! The twice baked potato is to die for , the dijon vingaresete dressing is so good!!! My only complaint was the peppercorn sauce I am glad I ordered it on the side , it almost tasted like some sort of cleaner . But will definitely be back! My wife and I always share the bone in ribeye. She always orders a drink the strawberry fizz which isn't on the menu anymore but they still make it! And of course we always share a desert !"}
{"text":"Service sucks when I told the manager he blew me off server must have been his girl friend!"}
{"text":"Excelente restaurante. A carne estava perfeita o prato de atum achamos que poderia ser mais bem servido, minha filha achou que veio pouco atum, mas estava uma delícia!"}
{"text":"The service was spot on! Trevor was charming, polite,  and helpful...an awesome server! I've had steaks around the world, and these steaks were truly the best I've ever had. The filet mignon had a delicious flavor,  was super tender, prepared perfectly, even though I asked for it to be butterflied. The teriyaki steak was perfect as well... flavorful and subtle in flavor at the same time. The Dr. Loosen dry reisling is also highly recommended.  My husband and I are in town celebrating our anniversary and my birthday,  and they gave us a complimentary dessert, very thoughtful and delicious! 100% a must try if you are a steak lover and in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Good place to hang with friends after work. The happy hour is fabulous!! The food is always good."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this restaurant. Everything was great; the food, service, and the atmosphere. I ordered the Fillet Mignon and it was perfect. The mashed potatoes were the best I've had yet. Our waitress was very attentive and sweet. It was nice to see the manager on duty walking around and talking with the customers. I will definetley be back again."}
{"text":"Food is top quality.  Sometimes it can be so noisy, but worth it.  Waitresses are smoking hot. Sourdough bread is killer."}
{"text":"Been to several Keg restaurants, always good food and I can never get enough of the Mushroom Neptune,,,,,LOVE those stuffed mushrooms"}
{"text":"We are always looking for kids friendly restaurants. This is definitely on the list. The kids menu had a good selection(mini burgers, ribs, steak, chicken fingers, and something else). One child picked the mini burgers and they were good and \"juicy\" according to my 7 year old. Other had chicken fingers and those looked OK. 

As for the adults..... 

Atmosphere was great. It was like a lodge when you walk into the establishment. Got there at 6pm on a Friday night and were immediately seated. Tried to get reservations before hand however they do not accept reservation after 5pm. Why I don't know...... Seems to me that if they are looking to serve a certain clientele they should accept reservations...looks like they are trying to compete with Outback restaurants - no reservations. 

This is a Canadian establishment so I decided to start with a Molson in tap. I must say, it was served at a perfect temperature and definitely quenched my thirst (even had a few ice bits in the first sip). 

On with the food.....My wife had Prime Rib Classic Dinner. It comes with Salad and side (onions, bell peppers and mushrooms sauteed). Wife said the Prime Rib was was a 4 out of 5. 

As for myself, I had the Fillet. Which came under recommendation from the waiter. I typically go for the rib eye steak. I got the salad and sides same as the wife. I could have done without them. Not a big fan of partially cooked onions. I would have preferred them caramelized. Ordering a steak's doneness is always a crap shoot for me. It never comes out as the way I want it. On the menu it tells you the degree of doneness and decided to go with what it stinking if a restaurant has the name \"Steakhouse\", I could not go wrong. I ordered medium. Well it came out in my opinion Medium well. Also since they cook the steak in such high heat, there is a layer of charred meet where the Fillet was touching the grill. Not my favorite. 

All in all I would like to give this place another shot. As I think anyone should do. Will update this review whenever that happens...... 

The waiter was attentive (almost too much). Hate trying to talk with my mouth full. But how can you really complain. 

PS my 7 year old is saying this place is a 5 out of 5. I forgot to mention they bring fruit, carrot and celery sticks out for the kids while we were waiting for out entrees. The kids loved that......"}
{"text":"I went here last night for happy hour / dinner and my opinion of this place is slipping.  Their happy hour drink menu got a lot smaller.  Plus, there are no well drink specials to be found.  Also, the bar area is just too busy for 1-2 waitresses.  It gets frustrating when you have to wait too long for a drink or ask several times for more of those awesome chips.  We probably would have stayed longer and spent more money if it wasn't such a pain to order more stuff.

Anyway, we had a few drinks and some appetizers.  All the appetizers are excellent.

Last time I went I told myself I wanted to try their filet.  So this time I did and it was just ok.  It wasn't worth $25 and why they wrap it in bacon I will never know.  However, it was cooked properly and was tender and pretty flavorful.  I also had their wedge salad was was excellent."}
{"text":"We have always loved The Keg, but haven't been for a while, so we decided to visit the location north of Yonge and Sheppard.

We walked into the restaurant at around 8:45 pm on a Saturday evening and we were asked to wait for 20 minutes for a table.  Given a buzzer, we headed for the cushioned seats.

During the wait, we took a quick glance around the dining area on the first floor -- nicely decorated, but a bit loud, in my opinion.  Thankfully when we were called, we made our way upstairs (in an elevator) to the second floor for our table -- a much quieter, more intimate setting.  Note:  the washrooms at this restaurant is located upstairs only.

The service was great and the food was awesome! Our waiter, John, was very attentive and funny.  We would definitely go back for another dinner!"}
{"text":"After a 14 hour flight from Tokyo, Japan I was stuck on a layover in Toronto I happened to get lucky with the hotel choice that put me right across the street from The Keg and I couldn't have been happier! I walked in and it was busy luckily it was just me and the host told me the bar was first come first serve, there was one open seat lucky me again. I ordered a wedge salad and I was not disappointed it was fantastic the lettuce was fresh and crisp the bacon bits where real bacon and warm with an awesome blue cheese dressing and real blue cheese crumbles I was in heaven with the salad alone. I almost forgot about the steak I had ordered which came out cooked perfectly at my requested temp of medium rare, with my steak was some veg and a twice cooked baked potato. I didn't eat the baked potato because it had other ingredients in it i didn't like but the rest of the food hit the spot and was exactly what i was looking for. If I happen to be back in Toronto I will stop back by for another awesome time and meal!!!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food! Their menu is maybe 80% gluten free (all but one or two of their awesome steaks included!), and they do have a separate GF menu you can request. Server was aware of and sensitive to dietary restrictions.  We will definitely be making The Keg part of our regular rotation!"}
{"text":"We had a late dinner on new years eve. We were seated right away even before our original reservation time of 9:30. The place was packed but the service was on top. I ordered the top sirloin steak and two lobster tails. Also my wife had the 20 oz ribeye with scallops. Have to say this meal was not cheap but the steaks were done to perfection and the seafood was remarkable. We have been to the Chandler location but this wins. And on a holiday it was incredible. We will return soon"}
{"text":"This is the best and my favorite place to eat hands down!!!! Filet mignon and lobster are my favorites!"}
{"text":"I'm rewriting this review because of the excellent customer service following my 2 star review from February. I was immediately contacted by someone from The Keg after my review asking if I would like to provide more detail. I was happy to oblige. After that I spoke to Dave Campbell, Operations Director. He was apologetic and even let me know they had recently made changes to the restaurant and hoped I would give them another chance. 

Long story short, my wife and I went back for her birthday last night. It was a great meal. My filet mignon was cooked to perfection. The dessert was spectacular and the service was great. 

I wish all restaurants took customer service and satisfaction as seriously as The Keg does. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"I have been to the location at Desert Ridge a few times - usually I have great luck sitting at the bar (otherwise there is usually a wait to be seated....waiting in line for food sucks!!!) If I can park myself right in front of the tv screens....Im feeling pretty good.
Portion sizes were pretty healthy ( Im told I eat like a guy....) so I thought it was pretty good value.
Service at the bar.....well it wasn't the most attentive but I will say she looked like she was trying pretty hard though."}
{"text":"Went to The Keg for the first time tonight with the hubby! It was superb! I got the teriyaki steak, a twice baked potato, and some roasted red bell pepper. Portions were great and my steak was cooked perfectly. We even shared a cheesecake with some tart cherries on top! The restaurant itself was beautiful and the service was wonderful. Prices are a little high, but it is understandable why. This is a wonderful place for a date night or a birthday dinner! Our wait was a little long to get our table, which is the only reason why I did not give the restaurant a five start rating. Other than that, I do highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"We went there on our trip out west 2016. It was good but not \"the best\". The service was great. Atmosphere was very nice but not pretentious I had filet that I could have cut with a fork but it was so thick I used my knife. Brussels sprouts were okay but I have had better. Wedge salad was super cold and wonderful."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, cozy atmosphere, good food.  I have no complaints about this location or with The Keg as a chain in general.  More importantly, my wife has no complaints either which is very rare.

I wouldn't say the food or service here is of Mastro's, Ruth's Chris or Capital Grille quality but its the next best thing.

If you haven't already I suggest signing up for their birthday club thing.  They will email you a certificate good for a free meal to use during the month of your birthday.  It will say you can use it for a steak but you can get the cash value ($23 or something) to use for whatever you want.  Last night my wife and I sat in the bar area to take advantage of the happy hour drinks and those awesome potato chips.  The happy hour drink specials for beer and wine are pretty decent but the orange martini thing is way too sweet.  They should just have a regular martini.

Anyway, I had a burger and my wife had a salad with grilled shrimp.  My burger was perfectly cooked and had excellent flavor.  My wife's salad was very tasty as well and contained 6 or 7 nice size shrimp.  For a side we shared an order of the roasted beets which were fantastic.

The only downside of this place is that it is located in Desert Ridge.  I hate that place with a passion.  It is always so crowded and the layout of the place just sucks.  Just getting in and out of the parking lot can be a clusterfuk.  Whoever designed this place is an idiot."}
{"text":"Had dinner with family and it was delicious. Our server Preston (nice name) was professional and awesome. Handled our party of six beautifully.  We had Prime Rib, Filet Mignon, Chicken, Lobster, Garlic Cheese Bread, Ceasears Salad, and Billy Miner pie and Cheesecake for desert. Serving staff helps one another and the Manager Maria stops by, with a beautiful smile to make sure everything is running smoothly.  My family had a great dinner.  Looking forward to my/our next visit. Prosecco was cold and bubbly too.  Nice addition to our meal."}
{"text":"The ambiance is nice, but the food is average at best. Not what I expected for a nice steakhouse, but in line with what you would enjoy at a chain restaurant.  Also, if anything goes awry, don't expect them to act as anything other than the chain they are. They have strict policies and no interest in going the extra mile for the customer, even if the fault is theirs."}
{"text":"Love this place! Has some of the best martinis in the area! Would definitely recommend this place for casual late night drinks"}
{"text":"2.5 stars rounded up to 3

Keg used to be my go to value steak house in Vancouver. I've moved to Toronto now and have tried 4 different locations.  Food is always decent but tonight the steak was full of grissle. I didn't even eat half of it.  3.5/5 stars

Service all all 4 kegs in Toronto was terrible. They need to train their staff better.   1.5/5 stars 

I think I'm finally giving up on the Keg. 

Cactus club in Vancouver has a great steak at the same price point. Will try the new Toronto location one day (if it's not so damn busy )"}
{"text":"No prime rib?! Manager says next time make a reservation and say you want prime rib and we might save it for you...not a great approach. Filet was good but not why we came here to celebrate a birthday on a Saturday night at 7pm. Nothing comped. Except dish of ice cream. Not pleased."}
{"text":"Food here is always good! Tonight is my husband bday so we came here with the kids(teenagers) and Megan(in the bar area) made our experience even better! We'll definitely be back for more amazing food and service!"}
{"text":"Came here early on a random Sunday night. We live no where near the restaurant but we were happy we stopped by. 

I got the small sirloin and the bf got the baseball sirloin which was the bomb. Better flavor and more tender than mine. The sides and salad were good also. 

Service was really great even though he had a 12 top so he was slammed."}
{"text":"Love the keg! This location is up to par with the mansion when it comes to service. Manager is very attentive and helps all the severs good to see! Food was great. One of the steaks was not cooked as ordered but the manager quickly replaced the cut. Double mashed potato was really dry but you go for the steak and it was awesome!"}
{"text":"The keg steakhouse has amazing steaks  and food.  Just sitting at the bar and smelling the steak of the  guy next to you will make you want to order one yourself.  Also the service is excellent., especially Courtney at the bar.  Her charisma makes you just want to keep coming back."}
{"text":"I can not put enough positive words together to describe this restaurant! The staff, management, cocktails, food, and atmosphere are exceptional!! This is a definite enjoyable dining experience on all levels!"}
{"text":"Great new space. Same reliably great food. Incredibly slow service. I am very certain that the woman eating alone across from us was served my dinner. Steak, lobster tail, baked potato. She came in after us, and was finished her entire meal before we even received ours. We were told at one point that our meals would be right up. Fifteen minutes later, our meals were \"all ready - just being plated\".  Fifteen minutes later, they were, \"coming right up\".  We waited 45 minutes from the time we finished our appetizers to the time we received our mains. It was a relatively quiet Sunday night, so other than them giving my meal away and having to make it again, I don't know what would take so long."}
{"text":"To start when we arrived we only waited about 5 minutes and then were seated, which is pretty amazing. It was probably due to the fact that we were lucky and it was a holiday so most probably thought the restaurant was closed. 
Ordering food and drinks was very efficient so theres no complaints there, everything came out very quickly and tasted amazing!!
The only suggestion i would have is that there needs to be more variety in the starters, its a lot of sea food which some do not enjoy ( namely my father being one of those people). But being that i enjoy sea food i have no complaints about the variety. 

Definitely will come back!!"}
{"text":"I took a friend there last night. When I made the reservation they asked if it was a special occasion which it was and I so told then - a birthday. The reservation was for 7 and we were promptly seated at that time. Our server was AJ. I kidded him that AJ was not a name - maybe a mistake to do that. I had the sirloin, chopped vegetable salad and a shrimp cocktail. She had the dungeness crab and a glass of wine. She was quite happy with her food. My steak was flavorful but slightly over done. The shrimp were great but the vegetable salad was not to my liking - my bad - I only ate a few bites.

I have eaten at this location several times before I moved and found both the food and the service very good but that was a few years ago. AJ was very inattentive. Especially noticeable with the relatively light crowd at the beginning.  He returned to the table only when needed except for once to remove my plate. He passed our booth several times when serving the adjacent booth with a larger party. He did not ask about the uneaten salad. He dis not ask if we wanted more to drink, how the food was, or if we wanted any dessert (I had planned on having the great sounding Billy Miner pie).

My friend took it on herself to talk to the manager on the way out. He was polite but did not seem very concerned. A mild apology and saying he would talk to AJ. Somehow I don't think he did hence this review.

Very doubtful that I will return - it is a distance to travel for such service. And BTW - no acknowledgment of the special occasion. Why did they ask?"}
{"text":"The food and drink were excellent. Our server was an absolute delight. She was quick to bring drinks and made menu suggestions. She was very patient when we were not quick to order as we kept visiting with each other. She helped us when our phones were acting crazy and is just an all around nice person. Thanks to the Keg"}
{"text":"I watched this location each day while under construction, anxiously waiting for the doors to open. Yes, I am a die hard Keg fan! I've been to most locations in our province and while we can argue who makes the best steaks, the one thing I can always say is the Keg is consistent! Great food, good service, and always very cool decor. The dark, and royal blue theme along with blue velvet walls looks amazing in this location, including the upper dining area. Very classy design and I can't wait to enjoy the upper patio when summer comes around! 

I attended with a group of friends on a Friday night and while I did have a dining room reservation, I opted to sit ourselves at the bar knowing it would make for a lively evening. While this location just opened this week, service was on point (albeit they over staffed given training and monitoring needs by HQ i'm sure). Our server April, did a great job along with the collaborative effort of the bar team. The bar manager Denise, introduced herself including the GM to make sure all was well for our rowdy group (my apologies). Food came out quick, great presentation, and the consistency I've come to expect. Our steaks, prime rib, and chicken dishes all excellent! The one minor disappointment was the  small portion on our nachos order but I'll let that go! 
We also had several pieces of the billy minor pie to end the evening! 
Kudos to all staff who served us and I can't wait to return. Congrats and see you soon."}
{"text":"Love this Keg my favorite of all in Arizona!! The French onion soup is Amazing the the pepper corn stake as well! Staff is very friendly and knowledgable about their menu!"}
{"text":"This is my second time visiting The Keg. Once in Tempe and once in Chandler...this was the most recent visit. 

I was fairly disappointed with the Chandler location vs the Tempe location. I had the same meal at both locations a year apart with the use of the Restaurant week menu. I had the lettuce wedge, prime rib Oscar, and the miners pie for dessert (all for $44). The lettuce wedge was yummy. Bacon, ranch, and lettuce. Next came the prime rib Oscar... Which also had asparagus, scallops, and shrimp. I had some stomach issues afterwards, probably from the hollandaise sauce. 

Was able to take the dessert they offered home with the deal. It was delicious and the highlight of the otherwise disappointing meal. Oreo crumb bottom, mocha ice cream, and almonds. 

This visit to the Chandler location was disappointing, if I was to visit the Keg again (for their dessert) I'd definitely go to the Tempe location."}
{"text":"Went there with a colleague and two guys from UK for a business dinner. The place was packed, as it is every single night.
Ambiance is very nice, service is superb and the food is even better. The stakes are phenomenal and they have a good selection of beer as well.
Definitely a great place."}
{"text":"The food is good. Kayleigh, the manager, is very nice, professional and genuinely concerned about the customers. She made our dining experience an enjoyable one. We will dine there again."}
{"text":"5 star steaks/service/wine.  The wine is bit over priced but the steak is fair for the quality.  I have eaten there many times over the years and when on business in Canada got same service and food.  Never let down.  My favorite is the teriyaki steak Chicago style, medium."}
{"text":"The best dinner and service we have ever had! This was my hubbys and my 4 year anniversary. We had several different servers wish us a happy evening, and they even have us a card! Our server Nick Rocca was amazing! He guided us through the menu and was very attentive even though the restaurant was busy. To make the evening more special that brought us a glass of complimentary champagne and wished us many more years of happiness to come. The food was incredible ! From the bacon wrapped scallops to the creme brûlée everything was on point and unforgettable. The seafood was better than what we have had at the Salt Cellar. I highly encourage you to come here and be spoiled!"}
{"text":"Simply put,  won't be back. Stopped in today at 1:20 sat on the patio.  Patio was busy but not full. We were passed over by servers for more than 20 minutes. Shortly after we were told to seat ourselves,  my husband went inside to use the restroom and was suprised that no one came to the table while he was gone. He mentioned there were many employees inside at the bar standing around doing  nothing. 6 servers walked right by our table with no acknowledgement!  We typically don't complain but this trip warrents it. Very disappointing! Left and went to Kona's. Wouldn't give any stars but forced by this app to give something."}
{"text":"The Keg at San Tan Village, Gilbert, AZ - Thursday Sept 5th, 2013, about 7:00pm. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT.

I have been a huge fan of this Keg for many years, so that's what inspired me to write this review. In our party of five I ordered the Classic Filet, medium. When it arrived the first few bites were OK, but on the 3rd or 4th bite I bit into some grizzle. I thought that was odd, being that this was a filet mignon, but I decided to ignore it and kept eating. The last 1/8 of the steak however, turned out to be one big piece of grizzle. That's when I stopped eating and mentioned it to the waiter who in turn called over the manager (he did not offer his name, I did not ask). That's where the biggest disappointment came. I explained the problem to him, and tried to show him how tough the last piece was. He seemed uninterested in examining the offending piece of meat. As if reading from a prepared script for disgruntled diners, he admitted that once in a while a little \"silver skin\" may escape the notice of the chef (this remaining piece was easily 1/2\" thick). And then he proceeded to lecture me TWICE about how I should have let them know early on so they could have corrected the problem, completely ignoring that the problem piece was at the end of the meal. It felt as if he was implying that I was trying to scam a free meal.

To their credit, they took the meal off the bill, which was the right thing to do, and no else in out party had a bad meal. But grizzle in a filet? Really? I have never encountered grizzle in filet mignon. There are plenty of other steak places in our area to try out - DC Steakhouse comes to mind - but The Keg has slipped a notch, a BIG notch, in my book. It's a real shame."}
{"text":"I don't eat meat so I am the wrong to ask overall but place is awesome, super dark but not pretentious. Service was insanely good. I got the king salmon pistachio  crusted w/maple butter with asparagus (since the Brussels sprouts has bacon). It was really good.  Heirloom Tomato and burrata was lack luster. Mushroom Neptune was so good but super rich so only enjoyed a few. Was stuffed so took home a creme brûlée- which blew my mind. Expensive for an often thing but nice for a special occasion. Just a tad too dark in my opinion."}
{"text":"My co-worker and I are from out of town and found this place on yelp. It did not disappoint! Our waiter was very friendly and asked about it being our first time, and at the end of our meal he brought us a free dessert, and the manager stopped by to thank us for coming to check it out. Will definitely return on our next trip."}
{"text":"Don't recommend goin there! Rude staff and terrible service, served us food in dirty dishes n was giving the dirty look bc I didn't have reservation, sat at the bar and had to wait 15 minutes to get a drink forget about getting a refill! I ain't goin back there ain't worth it y'all can have it"}
{"text":"Good food, we come every year for our birthdays. Scott our server while very nice was a little slow with drink refills. Don't leave without ordering the creme brûlée .., it's the best"}
{"text":"The several visits I've had before tonight were all pretty flawless. Tonight started off with several challenges but management is only aware of one of them.  My fault for not insisting they know. 

Hostess - not horrible but she made us wait even though she said \"there is no wait right now\". Then said she would seat us in a few moments. Seconds later another twosome shows up literally in our shadow and they got seated immediately.  Then as punishment for pointing this out, sat us in the \"over flow\" seating area next to the kitchen where I felt like I was manning the wheel on the line. 

The Server - Austin was a very polite young man, but I was specific with my server when I ordered my Manhattan \"on the rocks\".  He of course brings out a glass of ice and a shaker...then dumps it over my rocks glass of ice. THAT IS CALLED AN \"UP AND OVER\". I don't know what had happened to the Bartenders of today who think every goddam drink needs to be served in a fucking shaker!  On the rocks means the alcohol is poured directly over the ice in the glass Im going to drink it out of.  One other tip - adding bitters to the Manhattan does nothing for this drink - 86 it!

My Entree - ordered Caesar salad followed by Lobster & Prime Rib rare. Received mostly well done piece of bicycle tire. Kudos to the manager who promptly replaced it with a fresh and delicious cut.  The Lobster was outstanding too!

All in all, for a $150 next time I'll cook this meal and save myself at least a c-note."}
{"text":"Perfect - first had the shrimp cocktail then the crab and steak combo. This surely wasnt sizzler. Drinks and wine was great. Twice baked potatoe. Just perfect."}
{"text":"Great location with lots of seating! Bartenders were nice and friendly. Only had cocktails and apps - both drinks and food was great. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Make a reservation. Can easily do this on open table. Excellent steaks-definitely try the blue cheese fillet. Side of veggies were cooked perfectly. We went the week of a dinner special and wow was it worth it. They did sell out of the prime rib, so if this is what you want then make your reservation for an earlier time. We went on a Friday at 8:45 pm. Decent wine list. Excellent waiter and front desk/bar tender. The bar area is a bit loud, but it's a bar. We got there a bit early and had a drink before our table was ready. We had 9 for our dinner and again everything was super smooth delicious! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went for our 18the wedding anniversary and we were not disappointed.  The food and service was awesome."}
{"text":"Best steak I've had in a while. I had the blue cheese crusted filet mignon and the wife had the sirloin off the kegs cuts menu. The meat came out exactly as we ordered it and was awesome. Service was super quick as well. I'd like to see more craft beer choices but I can't complain about my experience. It was worth every penny if you're worried about price go to outback for an inferior product. I will be back!"}
{"text":"My husband took me for a nice birthday dinner at the keg thinking hey it's one of classiest resteraunts in our area, let's give it a try.. Well I wish we had gone to red lobster or even east side marios instead of this keg location. I walked in and got seated in an area where we said \"PRIVATE BOOTH\" was right at the entrance infront of the kitchen and around everyone else. Not too private is that. Then we witnessed over an hour how the General Manager went over to all the caucasian tables to introduce himself and then walk back over later to check how the service was. When we complained later by phone, he gave a call back personally and said he's a family man and contacted his business partners and it was determined that he should call and resolve it. To which he stated that he was checking on ppl with cupons. #1. You dont know who has coupons, and #2. You should visit EVERY SINGLE TABLE and #3. Funny how only the caucasian tables for a span of 1.5 hrs get visits and no one else does.... Come on, we aren't fools! The serving staff is also not diversified, they are ALL caucasian with the exception of one chinese guy. When it came time to give an appoligy he said \"I can only appoligize for that perception that you got\" .. No it is not just MY perception. When you walk in - you feel it . SEVERAL people have complained about this and it is VISIBLE, that is not someone's \"PERCEPTION\" it's evident and obvious.

I have NEVER IN MY LIFE felt SO INSULTED as I did on that day of my birthday jan 10/2013

Now to pursue with the dinner, it was ok. Steak was not cooked to what we had asked, also - the waitress NEVER asked if we were celebrating anything I had to ask MYSELF if there was anything special for birthdays!! They advertise a cake piece for your birthday, so I was all excited! She brought it over TO MY HUSBAND not to me, and said \"here you go\" no that's RUDE thank you very much. 

Then to top it , she charged us for the \"FREE\" cake piece too. 

HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!!!!!!  This manager is beyond rude, and the staff there is also not up to par. Do yourselves a service and go to another location. I received way better service at MONTANA\"s , THE other KEG\"s at ANY OTHER LOCATION, even EAST SIDE MARIOS tops it!

If you will be paying over 100$'s for your meal think of skipping this place where they think caucasian wait staff and caucasian tables are the only ones that get the goods. 

Sorry this is brampton, WRONG PLACE AND WRONG PEOPLE 

Some people wont stick up, but I sure did! I will NEVER in my LIFE go back to that location. And i WILL spread the word so everyone knows !

the keg - bramalea city centre /brampton"}
{"text":"Went for my birthday and anniversary, and I was pleased by both the service and the food.  The waiter let me try a  piece of Prime Rib, since I'd never had it before (I know, what have I been missing?!?!), so kudos for going out of his way.

Another nice touch was the manager personally coming over to introduce herself and ask about our experience. 

Overall the service was great, and the food, while tasty, wasn't spectacular or terribly distinguished.  I probably wouldn't come here too often, mainly due to price, unless I have more birthday coupons."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night with several other guests. The overall atmosphere was great! Unfortunately, the AC wasn't working in the area we sat, however, the staff surely made up for that. I ordered the Rib Steak with asparagus and a Makers Mark on the rocks. The steak was cooked to perfection and tasted fantastic. I was a little disappointed with the bourbon whiskey selection (at least the list our server told us). Other than that, probably the 4-5th best steak I've ever had. The pricing was dead on too!"}
{"text":"The food here is good, but our waitress OMG, I guess she wasn't big on whether or not she got a nice size tip. I ordered a lobster bisque for an appetizer and right after ordered my entree of steak and a twice baked potato. She brings me a monstrous bowl of lobster bisque with one spoon and no bowls and leaves and doesn't look at us again for 20 minutes, when she did bring her eyes off the ground I asked her if this was off the appetizer menu, which I knew it was, but wanted to hear it from her, she says yes, I hold the spoon up and say we got one spoon and no bowls for 3 people, she says oh I thought you ordered that just for you. WT literal F???? Its an appetizer, there are 3 people at the table and after I ordered the appetizer I ordered steak and a twice baked potato, bitch how much food do you think I'm eating, ITS AN APPETIZER, THERE ARE 3 PEOPLE AT THE TABLE, OMG!!!! She was not attentive to us, literally barely looked at us, my daughter gave her more of a tip than I would have and I always overtip people. I just think if your going to pay 50.00 a person for your meal, your waitress can at least pretend like she gives a f$%#@"}
{"text":"I must say. I have been to the Keg many times at different locations. It's one of my favorite places to eat when I'm in Canada. My bad review is just this location. It all started when we walked in and sat at the bar. We waited for almost 10 min for a drink. It wasn't busy at the bar. They just were more interested in chatting that serving customers. This is my second try at this location. Both times an over cooked steak. I ordered MR and received a steak that was MW. I understand that the kitchen makes mistakes. Although I told the bar tender that the last time I was here they over cooked my steak. Don't over cook my steak! Of course they did. The manager delivered my steak. Didn't have any interest in hearing what I had to say. Didn't offer any discount. Just said this rarely happens. I must say the second steak was done to perfection. I have come to expect a high level of quality and service when I'm paying $50. For a meal. I have had better steaks at outback. Save your money or go to Stockyards."}
{"text":"The gentleman with the dreads behind the bar is super professional and very patient and attentive! Don't remember his name but he deserves a shoutout at the next meeting"}
{"text":"Eat here a few times a year, not always this location but have had the same experience at each one. 

I order the keg classic sirloin med rare with the Caesar salad and garlic mashed potatoes.

If you join their birthday club they will send you an email for a bogo which made dinner a little less than normal."}
{"text":"Just moved here from the San Francisco Bay Area this was the closest steakhouse to where we're staying. Disappointing! Ordered my steak rare did not get a rare steak. Sent it back got a new steak still pink in the middle. I think it's a different type of beef. It looked more like pork. I expect my rare steak to be red in the middle. We had appetizers which were average. Drinks which were good and served quickly. The service was probably the best part although not outstanding. We had string beans which were not cleaned properly. Some of them had pieces of the vine still on them. We sat at a table next to the patio door. Every time the door open it was like standing in front of a furnace with hot air blowing. I think there's a way they could remedy that but maybe not. I'm not sure who their competition is. This place is no Morton's or Ruth Chris's. I've had better meals at Black Angus, which is a chain that sells full meals and not ala carte steaks and sides so it's not as upscale more moderately priced."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out and eat good food. Fun atmosphere!  The food is really good as well. It's located in an easy place to park and get to."}
{"text":"Met a couple of friends for dinner last night after the softball games in Tempe. AZ. I called to make reservation for 6:30 the the same day. When we got there the place was packed, so we checked in and were seated right away. I had been to a Keg Steakhouse in Seattle a long time ago and it was not so memorable. 

Last night every thing was very good. 3 ordered the the prime rib and the other ordered the the Winter Menu Black Cod. 

We started with some scallops and bacon and garlic shrimp both were so small you had to eat them with tooth picks. But the dinner gets better as the evening progressed.

The prime rib was terrific as good as any Lawry's or house of Prime Rib. It comes with the Aus Ju on and a super spicy horseradish on the side. The beef was perfectly cooked. 

The Black Cod was good too. 

The dessert that we all shared  was a huge piece of rich chocolate cake with two scoops of vanilla ice cream with some raspberry syrup. It was yummy.

The service was great and the bill was even better $140 with drinks w/o tip."}
{"text":"I have been to The Keg at this location many times. Great for happy hour and bar food -- the nachos are fantastic as are the loaded spring rolls -- but their steaks and other sides are too inconsistent to justify the price. Dinner could be great or absolutely mediocre, not really a gamble you want to take on $30-$40 per person.

My boyfriend and I just dropped over tonight $100 on steaks, mashed potatoes, shrimp, asparagus, and mushrooms. The steaks were okay, nothing great. Cooked correctly but lacking flavor. We ordered two filet mignon steaks wrapped in bacon cooked to medium so they should have been delicious. The mashed potatoes tasted weird and the asparagus wasn't cooked correctly (odd since it takes like five minutes to boil asparagus). I didn't want to bother the server since in the past when I have had issues with my steak -- like being rare when I asked for medium -- they sloppily try to correct it.

Our server, Chris, was great. He deserved a great tip. It's the kitchen that is weird. I won't come back here for steak, rather try Ocean Prime for the slight price increase. 

However, the bar area is great for a casual bite and some drinks. Happy hour is great. They have yummy specialty cocktails like the Miami Haze which is very refreshing and you will be tipsy after two :) The bar is relaxing with flat panels. I love coming here for nachos and a blue moon on a weekday after work."}
{"text":"Kudos to the keg! I decided to give the place one more try and it has changed considerably over the past year, no doubt due to a new manager. The service was fast and our waiter Jay was very attentive. The food was cooked properly and exactly the way we ordered it. Jay told me that the new manager had fired a number of incompetent waiters over the past year, which accounts for the improvement in service. I give the place four stars because the prices are still too high for the quality of the food. Overall a good experience!"}
{"text":"We had a $50 giftcard for this restaurant so decided to check it out one evening.  We were seated immediately and first impression of the restaurant was that it was  cozy and comfortable.  A server came to a table pretty quickly and took our cocktail order.  Pricing on the drinks was rather high for the size of the drink that you get.  After looking at the menu I thought even the prices for the food was a little much for what you get.  Most of the plates do not even include a salad... It's pretty much a meat, a vegetable side for about $25-30.  

After we placed our order the server took off to submit the order to the cooks and within 2 minutes she returned to inform me that they were \"out of\" the item I had selected.  I always hate that, just when you think you're gonna try something really good, they tell you that they don't have it.  I then selected my 2nd choice item but wasn't as thrilled with getting that as I was with my first choice.  The side was supposed to be asparagus.  When my plate came I had green beans on my plate.  I asked the server, \"I thought this dish came with asparagus?\"  She said, \"Oh yeah, they were out of asparagus so they substituted green beans.  Sorry but green beans are not an acceptable substitute for asparagus and went terrible with what I had ordered.  Chicken was way over cooked and terrible, not worth the $26 price. 

Other things I noticed:
They must have had the heat cranked up to go along with the 2 fireplaces that were burning inside. It was way too hot in there and it was cold outside.  
The server informed us that if she goes missing it's because she's trying not to hover and that if we need anything we can ask another server if she's not around?!  I've never heard a server tell me that....

Most likely will never go back. It's just one of those places that you go, \"yeah seen it, ate there, won't be back.\"  Nothing impressed me and the food was terrible."}
{"text":"Was in Phoenix from put of town and found this place on Yelp.  Was very Happy with it. Val our waitress was super nice and helpful.  We ordered Sirloin Prime Rib and Filet.  All came out great.  Shrimp cocktail was awesome as well. Highly recommend if you are looking for steak in this area"}
{"text":"The ambiance was promising when we all arrived.  It was suggested that the prime rib would be the best option so I ordered the 7 oz, medium (using their menu-rankings and descriptions as a guide), plus the usual sides.

What I got was essentially steak tartar, with a millimeter-thick quick sear on the outside.  On first bite I wasn't sure what I was eating, so I had a second.  Then it became apparent that the middle of the steak was not only rare, it was completely raw .. basically refrigerator-cold to the tongue.

So, steak sashimi not being what I wanted I waited for the server to return.  This didn't happen so I got up and went searching through the restaurant, to no avail.  I finally just stood in the middle of a busy intersection until one passed by, and explained the situation.  He could not find our server either so agreed to take it back for 'reheating'.

A few minutes later someone higher up came and apologized and said another would would be right up.  The rest of our party continued to dine while I sat there with no dining whatsoever, no refills on water/drink etc.  About 20 minutes later my food arrived (45 mins after ordering), and everyone else was most way through theirs.  

With wine glass completely empty, no service for refills forthcoming, I proceeded into steak #2 with just a glass of water.

Steak #2 was marginally better, but in lieu of medium it was just well done on the outer ring and again, all-rare tartar in the middle.

I gave up after a few bites, just surrendered the meal altogether and just went to a taco take-out on the way back to the hotel.

I didn't do an exhaustive review of the check but it did not look like anything was comped, though the restaurant put in a $25 gift card for a future visit.  This I regarded as a final insult, as I have no desire to return to this place and in lieu of making up for the bad meal and poor service, the only apparent apology is an invitation to come back and do it all over again.

I hope others have a better experience."}
{"text":"The Keg is always our first choice when we come to Scottsdale and tonight did not disappoint. We had the bacon wrapped scallops with Orange slice Martinis for starters then split the ribs and chicken. Both were very good. We're both Gluten-free and there are several choices clearly indicated on the menu. Finally, our server Michael was professional and personable. He made kitchen aware of our gluten-free order."}
{"text":"I swear the filet was artificially tenderized.  The twice baked potato was just \"fair\".  Hubby had the strip and was happy \"for the money\".  We were hoping for more. The location is good from the Marriott, and the ambiance was fine.  We would opt to go to Mastros and pay more."}
{"text":"We went for a business dinner. Great drinks.  Calamari was so so   Tuna tartar was great and so was my seared ahi plate. Great taste."}
{"text":"Best for quality and price. $38 for keg classic 7oz filet. Comes with salad and side. Happy hour is average. When they have lobster, it is s must try"}
{"text":"Came in for an early dinner before a movie, and before the rush at approximately 6pm or so. Walked right in a got a table. I ordered the blackened sirloin and it was amazing! So good I have been thinking about it many times since that evening. It had the perfect amount of kick and the herb butter on top just make it that much more amazing. Very friendly and attentive staff, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is a very good steak house, but my favourite time to come here is during the summer when they have the lobster specials that come with the BEST mac n' cheese I have ever tasted in a restaurant... so far! The only downside is that they only serve the mac n' cheese during this time. Other than that no dice. :-(

The service is always top notch and polite, which I definitely expect when I look at the prices. They are more expensive than other steak places, but not by much. However, as they saying goes, you get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"Yelp says they do take out, but the host answering the phone was pretty rude about the fact that they don't do carry out. What? Who doesn't do carry out? They said that they \"don't have the right containers\" for carry out. Really??"}
{"text":"I'm usually impressed with service here. If ever any problems, they always take care of it immediately. The food is delicious and this is our go to spot for local steak. The appetizers and steaks are delicious. We've had a little bit of everything here. We have also gone during happy hour and their servings for appetizers were huge. I love that for kids, they have snacks that come out while we wait. We've also ate outside with nice weather. Really great place all around."}
{"text":"Just finished a great dinner at The Keg, desert ridge, I had the filet med well & it was perfect, along with double baked potato & Ceasar salad, food & service is always top notch, not the cheapest place around but for a special night out it serves up well. You must have reservations or wait an hour on the weekends, plenty of parking too, Usually dine here 6 times a year and haven't had a bad or disappointing meal yet"}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal here.  Its basic meat and potatoes fare but everything is done right.  Steakhouses like Mastros are on a different level in terms of meat quality etc, but that doesn't really matter here.  This place is family friendly and I feel it's decently affordable for what you get.  The staff here are all-stars in their own right.  They keep your water full, and are always ready to get you another drink from the bar."}
{"text":"Visited The Keg at San Tan Village, since I had tried the one at Tempe Marketplace before and had a good experience and food was good. Unfortunately our waitress was rude, and did not portray availability and helpfulness towards us with the menu or when ordering. Our drinks were changed multiple times due to being out of ingredients, and then when I ordered the Prime Rib sliders, they were way too chewy and really red and cold. Our waiter did not come back in time to ask before I was just ready to get out of such a poor experience and service. 
I would not recommend the sliders and I also advice that if you aren't feeling like working, don't come in because it ruins the mood of those trying to pay for their experience and service, which you aren't earning or working properly towards. 

Try a different location if you want to eat at the Keg and just hope for the best."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in on a Friday night. The parking lot was packed but they also share the lot with a Chili's. We were told the wait would be about 10 minutes which it was. Like an earlier review, the female servers were in skimpy tight black dresses, something like you would see in a chain breastaurant; tacky.

We sat at the bar for our wait and was acknowledged by the bartender right away and were served our drinks quickly. Some of the wall \"art\" reminded me of posters I used to have as a teen in the 80s. Time to enter this century, folks.

After sitting, our server Matt was professional as professional can be. Because this was our first visit, he explained to us how the different cuts of meat were prepared and would taste. Upon seating we were given a fresh roll of bread; it had a grainy taste but maybe that was the intent and that was the only roll we ever saw. The fried calamari was good as were the dipping sauces. I had the New York strip and garlic mashed potatoes. The plate also came with a few roasted green beans and red and yellow pepper slices. The garlic mashed potatoes were a little thin meaning kind of soupy but tasted well enough. Surprising for a steak place, my serrated knife was dull. I switched out my knife with my wife's, whose wasn't much sharper. I struggled cutting through the sinews of my steak.

All in all it was good service, the food tasted good enough, but with the dated wall decor and breastaurant style uniforms, the $75 tab for the two of us seems, well, overpriced."}
{"text":"The lobster alone deserved 5 stars!!! One piece of advice...get the lobster. Fresh all summer til sept 4th. The environment was great too."}
{"text":"What a great place. Didn't realize how good the food was going to be. Had Calamari for Appetizer, a Caesar Salad, Prime Rib and Twice Baked Potato!  Food was great and Service was top notch!  A bit Pricey but worth it!"}
{"text":"First time at The Keg on a Saturday night and a very busy place. We found a table in the bar area which is open seating otherwise a 45 minute wait. Ordered a prime rib and sirloin and both were very good. Service was less impressive, we waited ages for our bread, had to remind server but she said it was on its way. Eventually the bread came out at the same time as our entrees.  Cocktails on the pricey side. I'd try the place again and see if service improves."}
{"text":"Good midrange steak house in Gilbert, Az. Better than average customer service, with customary mid to high-end style decor. Good place to take visitors or a date.  I've been here a number of times, seeing as I live just around the corner and don't always want to drive into Phoenix or Scottsdale for a Steak. 

As mentioned in other reviews, The Keg is better than many of the other chain steak houses out there, but not on the level of a Steak 44, or Ruth's Chris. I've had the rib eye, prime rib, and a few of their sides.  I've also stopped in for an occasional drink, as they have a full bar with decent bar tenders.  

This most recent visit , me and my cousin were waited on by a very bubbly and pleasant young lady. I believe her name was Hollee (name on the receipt), and she put our visit over the top.  She was fun to chat with,  although she did poke some fun at our \"old guy drinks.\" Personally, I will ask for her section again on my next visit. 

Progressing through dinner, we start with the salads. I've had the Caesar and the wedge. The Caesar was a bit wilted for my liking, but the wedge was a bit more crisp and enjoyable. 

The steaks have a seemingly common steak house style rub, and have always been on point with the temperature that I order. Never over cooked, as I like my steaks medium rare. The prime rib has a flavorful rub, with a basic au jus. Both items have been enjoyable.

Sides are where the chain restaurant kitchen rears its ugly head. The twice baked potato has a good flavor, and is generally my \"go to\" side, albeit nothing truly epic. The mixed vegetables are just ho hum and rather bland. 

I've yet to try any of their desserts, although they do look good. I generally settle for one of their after dinner drinks from the bar (I will update this review, if things change). I do enjoy the Keg Attitude Coffee.

So the final answer..? One of the better places around the San Tan Village Mall. Yes I would recommend it, and I will be back again."}
{"text":"Crazy busy on Tuesday night.  Skip the line and eat in the bar.  Spinach salad and sliders are great!"}
{"text":"I frequent this establishment 1-2 times a year and always get the filet mignon with Caesar salad and twice baked potato. Always get the twice baked potato. This last visit I tried something different which was the lobster roll.... I wasn't as taken away by it as expected and I didn't like the different version of coleslaw. I'll stick with the filet next time. ;)"}
{"text":"First I usually don't complain but something has to be said. We showed up late and with respect to the staff we we're ready to make it quick the food was average at best but service was so poor we we're told promptly that she had other tables and didn't have time for us she brought one of the four of us a drink when we ask for other drinks she got pissed. And it went down hill from there so no matter what the food was like she dumped on the whole thing. I would use caution if it's a happy event maybe choose some where else if you want to spend $200 and get insulted and pushed go here"}
{"text":"While normally a fan of the Keg, very disappointed today. Went there for Thanksgiving as they advertised a 3 course turkey dinner for $27. Went and ordered such dinner what they forgot to tell you was that the turkey was some sort of processed mystery meat turkey roll which when sliced was both white and dark meat. It was the strangest thing I have ever seen and tasted like rubber mostly.  Can not believe they could not just roast some real turkeys and serve. That along with frozen mashed potatoes and some weird stuffing resulted in the worst Thanksgiving dinner I have ever had. In the future they should just stick with steaks and stay out of the Thanksgiving business. 
 Thanks Keg for making this holiday one to forget. Please close on Christmas."}
{"text":"Came here straight from landing at the airport. I was starving and happy that we didn't have to wait long for a seat.

I ordered the Top Sirloin with a side of Roasted Garlic Mashed Potato. The steak was cooked the way I wanted it and tasted great. 

The atmosphere was nice and the place wasn't too crowded. Service was also pretty good here. 

I would definitely go back here next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"First time in a steakhouse a very long time.  I forgot how much I like to atmosphere and the dark wood and warm environment.  The have a nice open bar to wait for your table.  The take reservations if your better than me and plan your trip.  I have the small fillet minion and baked potato.  It was delicious, I ordered it medium well and it was perfect they also served fresh baked bread and whipped butter while you are waiting.  The staff was very nice and helpful and made the visit enjoyable.  I will be taking my husband for a steak next time we are craving a good cut of meat."}
{"text":"I went there last night the waiter Max was a little chatty but nice I had a sirloin and it was full of grisel when max asked how everything was I told him next the manager Rob came over and agreed the steak was a problem he the came back with a new one and it was great they refused to charge me for my dinner.
The double baked potatoes were outstanding. Small problem handled very well no complaints would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Wow such a nice place! Grace was such a nice server!!! And everything she recommend was amazing! Will deff be coming back and to see her! The tuna tar tar was amazing!"}
{"text":"Love, love love . This place just topped our previous favorite, Texas Roadhouse. I know I know..not quite the same theme but the steaks here are the best tasting ever. If you can aford the 15$ price difference it's worth it. I almost forgot, the service is top notch, we sat at the bar since it was Friday and happy hour and the bartender was polite and alert."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious blue rare 10 oz. filet mignon. Baked potato and veggies tasted great as well. Friendly service."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, reasonable prices, and fantastic food! The New York steak was one of the best I've ever had and the bill did not require taking out a line of credit :)  Can't wait to visit again when I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"The bacon burger was excellent, very juicy, before that I had this crab mushroom thing that was really tasty. I did not get the skinny fries but instead got garlic mashed potatoes which were pretty good. I sat at the bar and Austin gave great service and was very cool."}
{"text":"Best for happy hour vs dining in. Came for a late Mother's Day celebration after enjoying many a happy hour here. Service was fantastic, food was mediocre. The ribs and chicken have the strangest sauce, that was slathered all over the \"roasted chicken\" roasted, yes, but the addition of the mustard based sauce was a disappointment. Ribs were average. My husband asked for the prime rib sliders sans any sauce , he hates horseradish and for our second time, it came with horseradish on the buns. My son had a NY steak, he ordered it medium rare and it was  definitely a medium cook. Wine good, service great, food..... not so much. Happy hour apps and drinks are your best bet."}
{"text":"Excellent service, the patio was beautiful.  The meat is very tender and flavorful. Yummy wedge salad!"}
{"text":"I had an awesome experience at The Keg with my family while visiting in AZ. Outside seating was plenty, our waiter was very friendly and efficient and the manager even stopped by and apologized/checked on everything as there was a minor mistake in our order. It was corrected within minutes though so no inconvenience at all. Would definitely recommend and come back anytime."}
{"text":"Love love this place. My fiance took me here for a date and the experience was one of the best. Service was on point, wine bottle selection very good, and food was excellent. I'll recommend this place for a special night out or if you just in the mood for a good piece of steak for a decent price. I gave 5 star because everything was on point. I recommend this place any day or time."}
{"text":"What can I say, The Keg never disappoints.  Their food is delish and their drinks are even better.  They made me an amazing strawberry martini that I still think about weeks later.  Sadly it was a \"seasonal\" drink so I won't be able to get it again until next spring/summer.  Their service is also always exceptional.  This is one of my fave spots, I just wish it was a little easier on the wallet."}
{"text":"The food is way over priced for the portions. However we had the best mojitos & waitress we ever had! She got a 40% tip she was that great! The dirty martinis are also good from what I heard. The Caesar Salad I had was good, that and the drinks were great. However all 4 off us that went agree that the price for what we all got was wayyyyyyy over priced!"}
{"text":"We were seated right away.
The service was great 
I ordered the BLACKENED SIRLOIN Coated with select herbs and spices and finished with herb butter.  WOW!
My Wife ordered from the \"Casual Plates\" section
TUNA TACOS Ahi tuna on warm tortillas with cabbage slaw and cilantro. Served with jalapeño maple aioli also very good.
I ordered CRÈME BRULÉE for dessert and it arrived exactly as described \"Silky and smooth. Topped with a caramelized sugar crust.\""}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner last night and it was great. The staff was on point and our server did a fantastic job. We started with soup and fresh bread which a tasty. The steak and lobster was really fantastic. 

Overall I would recommend this restaurant highly. Getting reservations was a good idea because it was very busy."}
{"text":"Love this place! My wife and I go every month on our anniversary day! One of our faves!"}
{"text":"Lobster tail is amazing!  I originally went for the prime rib, which they are known for, and it was good but not especially impressive.  The lobster tail was very impressive - succulent and just the right texture.  As an appetizer, the shrimp with cheeses was good, but too buttery and oily.  The Miner's pie was delicious."}
{"text":"I went here last night with some friends and we all ordered the 'dirty bird\" martini and it was so delicious! I also ordered the chicken Caesar salad which was also very good. The service was awesome even though we were the only people sitting outside I had just assumed they would forget about us, but instead they actually checked on us more often. Great service, food, and drinks!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat! Bacon wrapped filet and twice baked potatoes with an amazing wine list!"}
{"text":"First of all, the food was excellent.  I chose the bleu cheese topped filet mignon (wrapped in bacon) and I believe it was an excellent choice.

Their drink menu wasn't very extensive, unless you like wines.  They only have four beers on tap but that's okay because I got to try a Haywire Hefeweizen which I had never had before.  It was decent as well.

The keg doesn't get 5-stars for having an exquisite menu by all means.  This location in particular deserves the 5-star rating for its' service alone!  Our party got here at almost 11 at night on a Friday.  I had a long flight so I figured that nobody would even be willing to serve food, but the Keg definitely proved me wrong.  They were more than happy to seat us and the waitress was nothing but delightful.  She even cracked jokes about how the kitchen staff was ready to go home except we ordered food.  At that point I felt a little bit of guilt for trying to get a nice dinner so late.

It was a great experience altogether but what really topped it off was the Master Chef coming out.  It was well after 11 at night so I'm sure she was more than welcome to go home but instead she just came to pay a visit to her last table of the night and ask how everything was tasting.

Now THAT'S pro!"}
{"text":"Amazing place for steak. Make sure to call ahead for reservations as they are always busy."}
{"text":"My mother chose The Keg for her 76th birthday and seven us went. We liked the ambiance and the service was great. Our waiter was professional but had an ease about him. We had a variety of all kinds of their food and everything was done so well. So if you want a great ambiance, great food and friendly professional service, go the Keg. I've been to some of the finest restaurants in Chicago where i live, but this place was worth the money & I'd take my family there again when I visit. Everything from the time we entered till we left was so easy and satisfying. Thanks to all your staff & our waiter."}
{"text":"The ambiance was very nice. The food was delicious. The steak was delicious and my husband could not stop raving about the twice baked potato. The food portions are large and they were most accommodating in us splitting a meal. Our waiter, Brett, was very attentive and made sure we were well taken care of. The complimentary glass of champagne (celebrating a birthday and our anniversary) was excellent and quite thoughtful. A very good experience!"}
{"text":"Fantastic steak, cooked just right.  Tasty appetizers.  Mouth watering desserts.  Tantalizing cocktails.  Romantic atmosphere.  Friendly staff.  Good prices.  The Keg is our favorite date steakhouse."}
{"text":"Pleasant surprise. This place is alot bigger than it appears from the outside and the atomosphere is very inviting and comfortable. If felt that for the money the quality of food was above average the the service was excellent. I would recommend their special dinners that include the salad, steak an potatoe - very good value."}
{"text":"Steak was good but I waited too long. Waiter said that they usually take 20-25 minutes to cook it. My stomach was not so patient though."}
{"text":"Order the prime rib medium well - came out well done and so dry I couldn't eat it.  My husband order prime rib medium and turned out medium well.  A little less dry than mine. 
Wait staff was nice although constant hovering after what seemed like every bite.  Wouldn't leave us alone as we celebrated our 37th anniversary.  So much for an intimate dinner for two.
Will not eat at this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Just had dinner here tonight. We have tried the Keg a few times. We sat at the table in the bar area. The lady who waited on our table was very sweet, & gave good service. I ordered the prime rib classic which includes the wedge salad, prime rib (10 oz) & 1 side ($30). My companion ordered the Top Sirloin classic which includes sirloin, salad & baked potato. ($28). Prices are reasonable; but the food  was a little disappointing. First of all, my wedge salad was wilted, didn't taste fresh. My prime rib was a big disappointment. I ordered medium; it did come as pink in the center. But the whole prime rib was very chewy; indeed it was a little tough (even though it's pink in the center). I eat prime rib in other restaurants & always order medium, & the prime rib comes out juicy & flavorful. This one was not tender, juicy or tasty. My companion's top sirloin was better, but still lacked flavor. Is it  because of the cook or the quality of meat that is the problem? I would hope that they will improve the food, because I really like this restaurant."}
{"text":"service is not good?foodwas on table but had to ask  aboutwhere drinks went.

We were waiting and waiting then drinks were to be asked to serve


I guess KEG is not offering desert  anyways. I thought that I am in keg. I better off buy the keg seasoning from Costco and sit in my back yard"}
{"text":"We went there late at june 9 for our anniversary when they just had the dine in section closed but the lady in the front told us that she will ask if is posibble for us to be seated there. She did the best and the waiter that night was great and the all nite made sure everything was ok.
I don't have time to talk to much about the food , you just must try this place.
5* the lady at the front
5* the waiter
10* for all the kitchen stuff"}
{"text":"We thought we would try a new place for our 20th anniversary. The keg was our choice and we were not disappointed. The food was amazing and the staff starting with the young girl who seated us to the waiter and the manager made our visit so fun. Truly a wonderful experience. Definately will return."}
{"text":"We have enjoyed The Keg for many years which began in Seattle, WA. It quickly7 became one of our favorite places. The food is always cooked as ordered, the wine is exceptional, and the escargot is one of our favorites. We were pleasantly pleased to see that they had a location in Phoenix and it is also one of our favorite places. The service at all of the locations we have visited over the years is excellent. They take their time and give you the attention you deserve. Have been to Vancouver BC, and all of the locations in Seattle. Now to find Phoenix is a plus."}
{"text":"Good drinks! Bruschetta was great, very tasty Balsamic to accompany it! We sat in the patio during happy hour over all the happy hour  specials are not that great and if you sit on the patio please note there is a busy intersection near by, but I'm sure as business picks up the car noise may drown out however we were there from 4-530 And it was a bit loud. Ordered prime rib, twice bake potato. Drinks to try are the forbidden fruit and Miami haze, pretty tasty."}
{"text":"We had dinner twice. Yesterday evening and the night before. The night before yesterday we had dinner at the bar. Waitress was super nice and attentive. She made sure that my food allergy (mushrooms) for which I can get very sick was reported to the kictchen and to the manager who personally came to reassure me. Food was great: burger and coliflawer stake. The cake (I do not recall the name but the first in the list) was astonishing good.
Yesterday night we went again. We were set in the resturant downstairs. The short stairs. The waiter was you g and even if informed about my foid allergy as the night before did not have the manager pass by and made a lot of useless jokes about my food and the mushrooms. I spent a horrible night with mild sign if my food poissoning. The food was great but the waiter deserves one star for being not careful enough to guarantee my food to be safe from mushrooms."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go.  Last three things I have had (prime rib, filet, and new york steak) had been amazing.  One thing I was not a big fan of was the baseball sirloin.  

For having several locations in Phoenix area, they keep the quality high."}
{"text":"We have eaten at the Keg before, but this was our 1st time to this location.  Happy hour in the bar was good, but service in the restaurant area was very slow.  It took over 10 min for our waitress to acknowledge we were there...that was after my husband went up to the manager and complained.  They did comp us a free appetizer and dessert.  Food was ok, but not as good as other steak houses I have been to."}
{"text":"This was our first time visiting The Keg and we were impressed. The filet with the grilled shrimp was fantastic. Meat was prepared perfectly and the shrimp were large and very tasty. For a side we ordered the twice baked potato which was also great. Others in our party ordered the fresh lobster and said it was amazing. Definitely returning."}
{"text":"This place is a hit or miss kind of place for me. The food is great or just okay. The service is decent. My big gripe with this place is that it's just too loud. I don't want to have to shout at my dinner partner. I've been to better steak houses where its also loud - however the food was so divine, you don't care. When it comes to the Keg - I care. Tone it down please!"}
{"text":"I had a really great experience here for Mother's Day. The only downside I saw is that for the amount of money you pay you would think that they would pack your food to go for you. Other then that the waiter was good, food was great and experience was awesome."}
{"text":"I made a mistake and got the steak medley thing with the shrimp. I thought I was ordering an actual full steak but got three tiny balls of steak and some mashed potatoes and shrimp. It was no where near filling. I had to go to Taco Bell after. For what I spent I could have gotten a full filet which is what I thought I ordered. I even told him I wanted a 10 ounce filet! I didn't know the steak with the shrimp is small and not a meal so DONT order that! It's a trap! They lost a star for the scam. I come to a steakhouse than I expect a full steak not steak bites! I spent over 40 bucks for tony pieces of steak. What a rip off! I told the bartender that I thought I was clear when I said I wanted a 10 ounce filet but he just laughed and I was stuck with some bullshit toddler sized food while I had to stare at the guy next to me as he enjoyed his huge piece of steak!"}
{"text":"I went here on a Tuesday and it was surprisingly busy which is always a good sign. I had a real craving for steak and pasta but the enthusiastic waiter informed me that the only pasta they have is their new Mac n cheese. They serve bread and it's decent. It's a round bread cut into triangular pie shaped pieces. I got the 12 once sirloin medium with cream spinach and Mac and cheese. I was surprised to see asparagus next to my steak and lots of it. They could have kept that asparagus because it didn't have a drop of butter or any kind of seasoning up on it. The steak was actually medium, you know a lot of places can't seem to actually present you with a medium steak but this was cooked perfectly. It was juicy, tender and well seasoned! They give you big portions of sides! The Mac and cheese I couldn't eat all of and it was so delicious. It's got real cheese and it's not some instant Mac and cheese mess that Texas Roadhouse has. The creamed spinach was amazing! I added some pepper to everything and it was beyond amazing! I forgot that i also had a skewer or grilled shrimp and they were very dry and tasteless. I recommend they make a sauce for them and grill them in a sauce and not overcook the shrimp! The spinach had a cheese on top that was the perfect touch!"}
{"text":"The Keg and Bar came recommended on Yelp so I gave it a try, It is a nice bar and restaurant inside with beers, TVs, and friendly staff. I give 5 stars for the 10 oz Filet mignon that was well done but not beef jerky which some places do when you order \"Well Done\" This steak was delicious and worth its $37 price tag especially with peppercorn sauce! Lobster tails were ok but AZ is landlocked so I recommend Steak! Free dinner sourdough  bread roll is a great touch and so are delicious crisps they give you at bar. I recommend The Keg."}
{"text":"The food was great, but I could get the same food and quality at other restaurants for much less. The dark atmosphere was almost too dark, but that seems to be an issue at a lot of restaurants, though."}
{"text":"They have an awesome happy hour. Very friendly staff. We sat at the bar and have had the same bartender a few times . She's very quick and always attentive ."}
{"text":"We are fans of the Keg and last night we went with some friends.  It was a party of six and it was a very busy night between homecoming and it just being a Saturday night.  We were initially told it would be about an hour wait so we headed straight for the bar.  We ordered drinks and within 20-30 minutes our buzzer rand to tell us our table was ready.  We were surprised.

We sat in the dining room and had a really nice server.  I can't remember her name but she was good and friendly.  We ordered our food and then had salads shortly there after.  A while later, our food came.  All was as it was supposed to be and very good.  We were then informed by the manager who came by to talk to us, that the food took way longer than it should have and that she'd like to give us all dessert.  Here is the thing, we barely noticed, nor did we complain.  We were having great conversation and didn't even notice that it took a while.  I thought that was excellent customer service.  To offer us free desserts without us even making a peep was very nice.  We got our desserts which were all very good as well.

The food has always been good any time we have been to this Keg.  The steaks are tender and flavorful.  The service has always been good and despite the fact that it took a little longer than usual last night, the service was excellent.  I am a fan of The Keg."}
{"text":"Pros:
Upscale decor
Side included with steak

Cons:
Service
Food quality
Veg options

I do not eat meat, but my fiancée does. We went for happy hour & dinner hoping for a date-night treat. He only gets a steak on the rare occasions I promise not to role my eyes and gag. He was disappointed in the quality and my options were unsatisfying. Not even a decent Bloody Mary. Slowest service with much attitude on the side."}
{"text":"Solid steakhouse! The service was amazing. Both the server and manager went above and beyond. There were five of us and we ordered a variety of things including a burger, prime rib, chicken and ribs, salmon and fried chicken. Although we went early and it wasn't busy the food took quite awhile and the chicken took longer than everything else. Both the waiter and the manager came over and apologized and it was genuine. They then brought us two desserts to make up for it which we weren't even expecting. Between the really good food and the exceptional service I know we will be back!

Btw, I had the salmon and it was fabulous!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst restaurant I've ever been to. We tried to reserve ahead of time, but they told us it wasn't busy and we didn't need one. Arrived 10min later to a hour plus wait."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday celebration & Dad tried The Keg for the very first time! 

Great service, amazing food, & quiet ambience makes this restaurant a favorite. Our waiter was Cody & he was AWESOME, keeping drinks filled, making sure our meals & appetizers were top-notch, & even convincing me to get carrot cake for dessert. 

We will be returning, as we all enjoyed our meals, which consisted of top sirloin steaks, baked potatoes, salads, ribs, lobster, etc. 

I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Always have the baseball steak. A cut that isn't always appreciated. Med rare is what I always request. Can't say I have ever had a bad one here. Had the lobster during lob. month last Sep and was delish. A week later had it at San Tan and it sucked. So it veries from place to place if u ask me. I'll stick with Tempe."}
{"text":"Hey Keg!!  Fire your hostess staff!  My husband made a reservation at the Keg for a Sunday night prior to Christmas.  When he called, he was hung up on & then he was placed on hold several times before someone took his reservation.  When we arrived, our reservation was not on the book and the hostesses insinuated he was some sort of moron that called the wrong Keg at which point he showed them their phone number on his cell phone call list.  After admitting that he called the correct Keg, they gave us a vibrating beeper and told us they would find a table.  We were seated about 15 minutes later.  As we were being seated, the hostess asked, \"have you been here before?\"  We replied, \"no\" and she walked away.  Why did she ask?  Our server was amazing, but the hostess staff needs to go.  To the Keg management...there are plenty of pretty, young women that also have customer service skills and half a brain.  Maybe you should hire some of them instead."}
{"text":"I took my dad and family here for Father's Day and even though it was a holiday, we only had a 30 minute wait and the service and food was excellent. My dad and I sat in the bar area while we waited to be seated and had a martini and a gin and tonic, both of which were made strong and poured at our table. 

My parents said it was one of the best steaks they had ever had and they were very happy that it was cooked exactly to order. My mom said she couldn't remember the last time she had had a steak that was actually medium well. I had the Alaskan King crab and it was also cooked well and served with butter sauce that was warmed at your table by a candle. 

The service was excellent and every waiter there was aware of our table and needs even though they weren't our waiters. Best team work between hostesses, waiters, and management I have ever seen."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times in two weeks and I have not been disappointed. The steaks are cooked perfectly each time and the vegetables are fresh and grilled with enough snap left in them to explode with flavor. 

The service is fantastic. The wait staff are very courteous and knowledgeable and each time we've been here the manager has come by to check on the service. 

Oh, and if you like mixed drinks, they serve a nice Tanqueray and Tonic, with the Tanq delivered in a glass with ice and line while the tonic is served in a separate mini-carafe so you get fresh bubbles in your drink. 

This is definitely going to become one of my musts anytime I come to AZ."}
{"text":"Been here a few times at the bar just for an app and drink usually.  Had dinner once and it was good.  This time, we were supposed to meet the girls at blue wasabi an hour later so the guys belly up to the bar and we have drinks.  Didn't know the girls were there too on the patio.  The drinks and bar service are always good.  No big deal.  The girls tried the escargot, scallops wrapped in bacon, and nachos.  They said they were all good apps.  They ordered margs that were good not great.  Fresh juice but just not the way we would make it, needs more lime.  The beer and wines by the glass at the bar were what you would expect.  It's a good place.  Middle of the road, a little dark, and  not to loud.  Kona is across the way if you want more action and crowds, although this place gets busy too sometimes."}
{"text":"Amazing food and by far the best customer service I have received at any restaurant in a long time.  The staff is amazing. I recommend the filet mignon! !"}
{"text":"Tuesday night is packed, I went straight to the bar and had no, none, nada, zero wait. Patrick & Debra were tending bar & tending to me. I started with a 12 yr old McCallen scotch, then the glazed salmon w/smashed taters & asparagus. Pretty good stuff for a popular place for tourist like me. Stay away from the hot buttered bread! Dangerous"}
{"text":"We went there for diner last evening. Food was ok. Filet mignon was savory and tender. However what bothered me were the mistakes from the service staff. They brought out the wrong salad twice! And again brought out wrong main course. Needs better trained staff."}
{"text":"As you know from reading my other reviews. Im a picky mofo. And not much of a meat eater. But I do like prime rib. So when I saw this was the specialty I rushed right over. It was great. Cooked perfect. Loved the twice baked pot. Server was sweet and recommended a nice wine. Bread very fresh. Manager even checked on us. I always appreciate that. A really great experience."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for good steak and have always had a very positive experience here. Nice brand new location located in uptown Koreatown near Empress Walk. Quite possibly the biggest Keg Steakhouse restaurant I've been too with lots of space. Both times that I've come, it wasn't busy and usually we come to the restaurant later in the evening around 9PM/10PM. I ordered basically the largest steak on their menu which is the ballpark steak. I'm definitely a sucker for their bread as it's so soft and taste amazing with their own butter. Usually I order some of the refills for the bread. Steak was nicely cooked with the right seasoning and there were a good amount of sides. Mashed potatoes were pretty good.  

For sides, you got to add the Atlantic Lobster tail with the butter added to your steak dinner to make everything right and taste good. Definitely fell in love with the lobster as it was just so good and you can get a decent amount of meat in the tails for $20!!! Overall, a very positive and memorable dinner experience on various occasions. Definitely a great place to keep coming back to get your steak fix!!"}
{"text":"Very good Thanksgiving dinner!  My daughter was the only one who opted for the turkey but it was delicious.  The rest of us had beef--prime rib, New York strip and the filet.  Nicely cooked, tender and flavorful.  I had béarnaise which put it over the top.  Also was happy to be able to sub Brussels for the potato side.  The Thanksgiving cheese cake with pumpkin drizzle was nice.  Dense but still creamy with a crunchy crust.  The creme brûlée was a winner too.  One nit was that our table was very poorly lit.  Thank goodness for the flashlight on my phone.  Hard to read the menu and also to see my food.  Fine line between a cozy atmosphere and sitting in the dark!"}
{"text":"I used to go to a Keg in Bellevue Washington and loved it.  This is no different, which is a good thing.  They have updated their decor some, and the food has been updated, but their steaks are still awesome.  Better than bar food really.  And more expensive."}
{"text":"On our recent trip to Arizona, my brother and sister-in-law brought my wife and me to one of their favorite restaurants, The Keg. The Prime Rib was great and the twice baked potato was delicious.  The beer selection was strong but I expected more options. The service was 8/10, very friendly and helpful server but he kept spilling water on my feet when he poured refills; not really a big deal though. One thing I loved about this place was the amazing ambiance while staying so casual. Flip flops, shorts and a t-shirt were perfectly accepted in a more formal setting. Next time we visit AZ, we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Melt in your mouth bacon wrapped steak. Amazing lobster. Everything we tried was top notch. Pricey of course but you get what u pay for. Definitely stop in if you can fit in the budget."}
{"text":"This is a great go-to for a beautifully cooked steak. Service is great and you can definitely tell The Keg takes the time to properly train their staff. The only reason I can't award 5 stars is due to the appetizer I had. The tuna tartare is one to skip. Tasteless with wayyyyyyy too much avocado and the tuna tasted as if it had been frozen. I had to salt the heck out of it and it still wasn't very appetizing."}
{"text":"I do not usually visit this area but I need to keep The Keg in mind when I am scrambling for dinner options. I consistently get a very good ribeye (they call it something else... rib steak?) cooked to my liking (very rare).

Also, The Keg is becoming my favorite Restaurant Week place. Their Restaurant Week menu is unmatched, in my opinion. They have solid main dish options, and their twice baked potato is amazing, and included as a Restaurant Week side without an extra charge, they also have these garlic shrimp appetizer, and they offer a full size dessert.

In addition, we have always had good experience with the service, some times just good, but most of the time great. And I think every visit we have had manager staff stop by to ensure everything was to our liking.

Overall a solid option for a nice dinner."}
{"text":"Ate here last weekend and really enjoyed it. Each of us got steaks and potatoes and both were cooked perfectly. I thought it was fairly priced for a quality steakhouse. Even though it is a franchise it had the feel of a individual establishment."}
{"text":"As a regular at The Keg next to Chandler Mall, it pains me to say that my last two visits were less than stellar. When setting up nearby tables, the busboy sent the utensils crashing across the tabletops. Twice in a row, there were families who could not control their children: screaming, doing somersaults in the aisles, etc. And then to order the recommended fish that turned out to be too dry to swallow...I am really disappointed! Where is the management presence?"}
{"text":"We came here earlier this month for my wife's birthday dinner. We've eaten here a couple of times before so not a first time experience. 

I just want to say the prime rib is amazing! Along side with a loaded baked potato also amazing! They even gave us free cheesecake!

A nice place to have a good dinner with great service. I will be back for sure:)"}
{"text":"Visited for my fiances birthday dinner with his family.

I booked in advance as this was for his 30th birthday and wanted to have the best experience. We arrived on time for our reservation yet waited for almost 15 minutes to be seated. I was surprised when I walked in to see the restaurant was half empty so was confused about the seemingly unnecessary wait.

In terms of atmosphere, the AC didn't seem to be working well (it was stuffy), there was a ton of random food scraps all over the floors, and there were a bunch of fruit flies buzzing around. Not a great vibe. Totally get that this is a chain restaurant but honestly expected more.

We ordered a bunch of apps and drinks to start, no issues there. When our meals arrived, my lobster tail was way way overcooked. I wasn't going to say anything but my fiance noticed and made a point to let the waitress know. She was kind enough to remove the entree from our bill without him having so ask so that was appreciated. She did also offer to have the kitchen re-fire another one but I didn't want everyone else to have to wait for me to finish eating. 

Just was overall a disappointing experience.

Wouldn't return to this location."}
{"text":"Amazing service, we enjoyed the delicious filet mignon and lobster tail. Manager brought us a desert on the house to celebrate our anniversary!"}
{"text":"Just when I thought I was going to be doomed to eat fast type restuarants during my stay in Chandler, AZ I stumbled across this gem.  If you like a good steak, this is the place to go.  

I had baked salmon cooked exactly how I asked for it.  It was super tasty, moist and seasoned perfectly.  I also went back another night to try their steaks and I was NOT disappointed.  Ribeye steak was phenomenal.

A must if you are visiting or a local."}
{"text":"I'm not really a chain restaurant kind of gal however I do enjoy The Keg and this location is by far my favourite. This location opened up just in the past couple of years so is very new and the decor is cozy/romantic.

Our server, Cody, was really awesome. Super polite, friendly, professional and knowledgeable as well. He recommended great wines which we really enjoyed and also checked in on us the perfect amount of times.

My mom and I very much enjoyed our visit. We each selected a classic shrimp cocktail to start - very good. She opted for the lamb chop special while I went with the pistachio salmon for my main. She loved her meal and I really enjoyed my salmon - cooked perfectly!

We ended off our meal with a slice of cheesecake. Insider tip : apparently you can get a mix of toppings on the cheesecake slice - we went with cherries and almonds but you can also pick fudge or caramel as well!

Looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night with my date on July 4th weekend.  The food here was spectacular.  I ordered the summer sangria (red wine - merlot and brandy).  It was above average for sangrias in Phoenix.  We both started off with caesar salads and they were very good.  We ordered the baked garlic shrimp appetizer.  It was heavenly.  The shrimp itself was okay but the whole flavor and the cheese was very good.  We were like \"Wow!  How much better can it get?\"

Then came our main dishes.  Mushroom and onion manhattan steak (cooked medium) and sirloin oscar steak.  It was good but didn't taste right.  I assumed it was some kind of weird seasoning but it turns out later, as I found out to be something else.  The atmosphere was nice.  The shrimp and scallops on the oscar were decent.  Obviously, you are not going to get good seafood in Phoenix.

Then came the check. They charged us $30 + $10 for the sirloin oscar.  The menu said $30 for the sirlion oscar.  The waitress herself was not all that friendly.  A little standoffish but helpful.  

The whole experience was a nice treat.  I would have given it 5 stars if we both didn't experience food poisoning after eating there.  There's definitely something wrong with the food since we both had an upset stomach.  Anyways, we went home and after about 2 hours decided to take an herbal anti-biotic.  

At first my date said she looked forward to coming back to The Keg and so did I, but later during the night after the upset stomach, she said she wasn't sure she ever wanted to eat there again.  We decided to throw away the leftover steak we took home.  The food poisoning was evident the next day."}
{"text":"We came here for a our Thanksgiving Eve Dinner.  Most of the food was very good.  I ordered the Keg Margarita, which was okay but the size was so small it disappeared quickly.  I am just used to be given more for $10 drink.

Then came the garlic baked shrimp with biscuit.  This was heavenly good.  We both loved it.  For the main course, I ordered the New York Peppercorn Steak medium rare.  It came in at medium but that's okay.  I accepted that not every cook can get the difference between medium and medium rare just right.  While the quality of the meat was very good and cooked very nicely, the flavor just wasn't there.  Kind of bland.  I tried 3 different sauces but without much effect.  She ordered the Filet Mignon Steak Dinner, and said the same thing about the steak.  

We both enjoyed the twice baked potato, which was very good.  Her caesar salad was very good.  Service is a little slow but it was packed.  We both had a good time.  Total bill with tip is $131.  Will probably return to try all the appetizers but won't order any steak."}
{"text":"Ouch. Going downhill guys. Been a Keg regular for years, but moved out of D Ridge so haven't been in 6 months. 
Service was good but over cooked wife's steak the first time (ordered medium got well) then did it again (ordered medium got purple rare). Also the twice baked was really dry and no anchovies for Caesar (swear they used to have anchovies). 
Hopefully this was a one off and just a bad night but we won't be back for awhile."}
{"text":"We made a last minute decision to come here for our date night Sunday night, and I am so glad we did! 

Ambiance is very nice, its a casual yet upscale feel.  Low lighting gives it a romantic sense, but the place is also great for business dinners or just hanging out with friends.

So part of the name is \"The Keg\".  I figured that might mean a nice variety of beer on tap.  They have a respectable wine menu, but their beer menu is lacking.  They do have a vanilla porter that is decent.

What we ordered:  Calamari, 10oz filet mignon, and the bleu cheese filet.  Both filets came with a side of garlic mash potatoes.  The bread and Calamari was good; a nice start while we waited for our entrees. Both filets were great, but the bleu cheese filet was awesome.  Cooked just the way I wanted, with the cheese crust and garlic giving it an extra flavor that made it that much more than the regular filet.  The mash potatoes were just okay.

Service was great except for one thing.  When  we ordered beer, we didn't realize that there were two sizes.  Instead of our server asking us, she automatically gave us the largest size possible.  I was a little shocked when they came, instead of a pint she came with a bomber.  I hate when they do the up sell without asking.  The bomber is obviously more expensive.

Because of that I had to drop a star.  So what would normally score an A on my report card, I have to give em a B"}
{"text":"Being someone who is not a fan of red meat, I don't go to steak restaurants very often.  But my best friend wanted to eat here and she was buying so... kind of a no brainer.  Our waiter, Damien, was very helpful.  I asked him for advice on different steaks, he asked how I like mine cooked, I told him well done (steak lovers, don't criticize, I prefer my meat NOT mooing!).  He recommended the New York strip so that's what I got.  It was very tasty and the baked potato I had with it was fabulous.  My friend however, ordered filet mignon, which was so rare it pretty much should've still had hooves and a bell around its neck, but she likes it that way apparently.  Hers, however, was a very bad cut of meat - it had this massive section of fat in it.  Even the waiter was appalled.  He had the manager come over to check it out and the manager gave us free dessert and took some money off the price of my friend's filet.  We had the brownie sundae for dessert and it was delicious!  I wish I could've eaten more of it!  Overall, my meal was really good.  I wish my friend had gotten a better filet but then there wouldn't have been free dessert and I am certainly not going to complain about free dessert.  Despite not being a huge fan of steak I would definitely go back to the Keg."}
{"text":"Disappointing. I've been to Keg restaurants I liked (for example, North Vancouver BC), but this one is a chain restaurant with a nice facility, but mediocre food and a staff that follows the playbook rather than giving good service.

My New York strip looked good, but was tough and just not a very good cut of meat.  My gin & tonic was sweet (not sure if it was the tonic or the gin, but it was really quite poor).  The calamari was reasonably tender, but I didn't like the batter much - and the sauces were lacking (a very sweet chili sauce, and a ranch dressing or equivalent) - a good aoli with a bit of a spicy kick would have been good, but no such luck.  It was one of those dishes that looks good but disappoints when you eat it.  One pleasant surprise: the brownie sundae was both good and at $6, a good value.

The atmosphere was nice - the wood and stone made the restaurant very appealing, but that was a misleading come-on.

My waiter was full of himself, making all kinds of pronouncements, and constantly up-selling, but not listening well to his customers.  He didn't remember my order, and had to come back and get it again - a New York strip, a baked potato with butter, a gin & tonic, and the calamari appetizer ... and he got both the steak and the potato wrong.  He got the up-sell, but he didn't understand that his patter didn't equate to good service.

One other annoyance: The tables are so high compared to the chairs that you can't let your arms hang at a natural angle - your elbows have to be 4-6 inches higher than is comfortable.  It may look good, but it's not a pleasant eating experience.

I won't be going back."}
{"text":"The Keg is a chain restaurant that I have eaten at in the US and also Canada. The food is always good here, everything is good here..

Great for dates or dinners with friends or to show business relationships a good meeting.

It's not for someone on a budget but we like it!"}
{"text":"The only Keg location I don't give 5 stars to...

It was a bit over a year ago....

The food was great and all would have been great but our waiter had some sort of attitude of rudeness that really annoyed me... I don't do rude....

I still give 4 stars because knowing waiting staff he probably doesn't work here anymore and the place should not be decimated by a brutal review based on a single short term employee when everyone else was doing a good job...."}
{"text":"Since I found the keg I refused to eat at any other steakhouse. Their filet is amazing and I've probably become spoiled from eating there. I also get the lobster tail to accompany it and it doesn't disappoint. I've only had a few minor problems with the restaurant but it may be because I get mine to go. I'll always be missing something. It might be bread, bernaise sauce or butter. I have to be sure to check before I leave and get home because once I'm home and digging in I don't want to go back out especially now because of being hugely pregnant. But even those small things don't stop me from going back. Just more vigilant."}
{"text":"As a disclaimer, I am a vegetarian who eats seafood once in a while, but went with three people who love steaks to the Keg. We came here since a friend got a card for a free birthday steak/lobster dinner (sign up when you get the chance!) and the opportunity for free shrimp cocktail when you state it is your first time there. As a recent transplant from Boston, the chain was decently set up (although the booths were in front of a warped glass wall to the kitchen? kind of strange) and the wine list was decent. And you can cork the wine bottle to bring home-always a good option. The appetizers were good-we got the Tuna dish with sushi quality tuna and this mushroom/olive spread. The other one was warm goat cheese with almonds and a kind of tomato bruschetta like spread that tasted great with the mushroom spread. The bread plate was warm and fresh but not too exceptional. I wasn't interested in the swordfish special and the only other options were the shrimp and salmon-and I didn't order shrimp since I thought we were supposed to get free shrimp cocktail (which we never did). I ordered just a plain garden salad for 4.95 and a plain baked potato with butter and chives on the side. The other patrons ordered steaks and barely finished them or the twice baked potato. It was fine enough, but not worth busting a pants button to eat it-never a good sign. The waiter didn't offer to refill or get another beer for the people not drinking wine nor did we get mints! The service was polite but inexperienced, the ambiance was horrible with the music they were playing (some kind of 50s music with Blues Brothers soundtrack and techno? I'd take smooth jazz over that ANY DAY), the seats comfortable enough but I don't like being next to a giant Folgers coffee can through distorted glass.

Oh well, if you want a steakhouse chain, there might be a better one around?"}
{"text":"Enjoyed our dishes. You can't go wrong with the Sea Bass on quinoa salad or the Sesame Ahi Tuna. Ask for Jordan's section. You will get great service; although all seats are great seats as the wait staff are very attentive. 
Thank you for a great experience!"}
{"text":"Impromptu date night here and it was great! I love the fire place!
Our server was fantastic and prompt. 
For starters, we ordered calamari which was  really good. Then we both ordered the fingers that came with a salad. Her got the wedge, I got the house salad. Both of us agreed that they were drenched with too much dressing but otherwise they were good. That's an easy fix and left to personal preference. 
He got prime rib with twice baked potatoes. I got the top sirloin cooked medium with garlic mashed potatoes. We tried ones another's and everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"Again, I am out of town and came here based on YELP.  In fact, I took a gang of 10 folks here based on yelp's rating.  Luckily, the ratings were spot on and my clients were happy and not disappointed at all.  The service was great and food was even better.  We ordered at least 6 different appetizers to pass around and they all tasted like entrees instead of typical snack food.  So we will be back!"}
{"text":"Perfect place to sit outside, have a couple cocktails and have a great steak.  Sirloin for me. Service is top notch, prices reasonable and again the atmosphere is second to none for outdoor dining. Will always return when in Chandler.

Update: Been back two times since my intial review and I dropped it one star. The first of the last two visits they transposed the order for my wife and I for our steak, when the manager came out to speak with us and rectify this....he did the exact same thing! By the time our steaks arrived after sending them back twice, we were no longer hungry after finishing the baked potato and salad and we were running out of patience. They went good for it and reduced our bill which was nice.
This last time my wife's steak came out very rare and as timing would have it,  it was the manager who checked on us just as she was first cutting into it. He took it back and again my wife worked on the baked potato and had no room left for the steak. The waitress also failed to bring out a wedge salad for one of the other guests in our party. She returned with our meals so getting a salad at that point seemed a waste. It also took some time before our drinks arrived as well.

The management again took my wifes steak off the bill and offered our two other guests a dessert for the salad mistake.  My steak was more rare than medium but I ate it anyway and it just wasn't that good, sad to say, as we really love the location and the outdoor seating. 40 minute travel from the house which we may not make again for quite a while."}
{"text":"Went on March 7th at 5pm, Sat outside which was very nice, however the music was way too loud. I asked our waitress if she could turn it down and she explained that although she sometimes has difficulty hearing the guests place their order, corporate insists on keeping the volume higher. Basically saying it won't help to ask.  Bummer for sure. So let's see how the rest of the experience fares...I ordered an 8oz Teryaki Sirloin, prepared medium, with fries and a very small portion of grilled peppers.  The entree's do not include a salad. Bread is not a standard rather an option, and it is not like other breads, really bland.  My entrée was $23. Fairly steep price for a small Sirloin. It was clearly cooked med/well to well done and it took some dedicated chewing to get it down. I also had a $9 Bloody Mary which was mostly ice and a 3' celery stalk (yes I said foot) My lovely Wife also had an 8oz sirloin which she ordered well done and it was cooked properly. $19. She also ordered a side salad with blue cheese and it was very good. She ordered a glass of the house Pino Noir and it was 12 bucks. Too expensive 
To be fair the Manager made his rounds and asked how everything was...I didn't bother to tell him that I can't hear my wife or the waitress over the blaring music and that it took two sets of teeth to chew the Sirloin. I didn't say anything because I was afraid he would attempt to comp us with something in order to possibly make it a better experience and possibly keep us there longer.  I knew that we would probably never come back for dinner again so it didn't matter and 10 minute's more of the screaming speakers and I'd have gone for the meat cleaver. It's too bad because this Keg was the first place my wife and I ate while we were deciding to move to Az so it's a  little sentimental for us. 
Long Horn steak house has the same steak with better seasoning, bread, salad, potato for $6 less and I can have a conversation with my wife. Drinks are cheaper too. Just no outside seating

If we do go back it'll just be an appetizer and a cocktail off the happy hour selection."}
{"text":"First time eating here! Wow is all I can say. It was magnificent - the bread is best ever! I had the New York with twice baked potatoe as well as mini brownie dessert oh my it was all sooooo good"}
{"text":"We came for our first visit which happened to be during Arizona restaurant week. My husband ordered off the regular menu but I decided to choose off the prix fixe menu which included an appetizer, entree and dessert. We were both happy with our choices and also surprised that we had not eaten here sooner considering we had received a gift card a year half ago.  The service was great and we look forward to going back to try the other menu items. I think the atmosphere would be perfect for any special occasion."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant several months ago during the Spring Restaurant week and have come back a couple of times since that first visit. I really like the atmosphere and ambiance plus the attentive wait staff has always been good every time. Our entrees have always arrived as ordered with generous portions. I highly recommend making reservations if possible since the restaurant looks busy every time we have gone."}
{"text":"The Kobe Burger and their Bread are the only things worth getting there. They're amazing. Skip the steaks, they're only okay, The service is usually pretty attentive and portions are average."}
{"text":"I love the keg! 
I'm a little baffled by the bad reviews, to be honest. 
I always get the fillet, and it is impeccable. I do not, as a rule, eat red meat. However, about 3 times a year, I make my way over to the keg and get a delicious steak. The asparagus (one of my absolute favorite underrated vegetables) is always amazing, tender, but never undercooked. Their cheesey-garlic bread is also very good (though the last time my mother was there she said they may have changed the recipe). the staff is a little bit overly attentive at times, but at least my drink is never empty!"}
{"text":"Last Sunday my boyfriend and I went to the Keg to help celebrate our anniversary. We are very glad we did! First the manager heard that there was a nut allergy at our table, so he personally came over with an ingredients menu to reassure us there was nothing to worry about in our dishes. That was awesome! Our server was patient and knowledgeable when it came to helping us choose a dish and wine to pair with it. I never had to look around for my server. I'd request the guy with a pony tail again any time! Lastly he presented us with champagne to celebrate again our special day. Couldn't have been a better dining experience thank you!"}
{"text":"A week before my birthday and our first anniversary(same day) We decided to go to the Keg for dinner! We mentioned  to the waiter that we were excited leaving to Napa in a few days for  the celebrations! They brought us two glasses of champagne for our anniversary And a lovely slice of Keylime pie for us to share with a candle  for my birthday! Great food,service and ambience! Thank you"}
{"text":"This is a higher-middle quality chain... a little on the expensive side compared to others like Firebirds so I usually get the Classic Dinners as they are the best deal. I go here about 4-5 times a year.

The Prime Rib is always very good and the Chocolate Cake is great. The coffee is usually pretty bad... they really need to step up the quality of the coffee."}
{"text":"I gave this location only 3, and not 4, start because it was so loud my server had to literally yell to talk to us. There were 5 of us at the table and it was difficult to hear each other until about 9PM when half the other tables cleared out... we were there 2 hrs at that point trying to hold a conversation on a normal level... it did not happen.

Not only was it loud with people talking, being a large high ceiling room so the sound carries, but the music was turned up too... so people probably raised their voices to compete with the music. When the room is packed, turn the music off! I don't see going back to this location if it will be this noisy.

I just could not enjoy a dinner with friends this way. It felt like being at a sports bar. 

I usually go to The Keg in Chandler, and love it - it has none of these issues... it is all about the building design. Chandler = good, Tempe = bad."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to The Keg and I was definitely impressed! We started with the calamari and spinach salad which were both very good. They also brought us warm bread which was good too. I ordered the 7oz blue cheese filet and my business associate ordered the rib steak peppercorn style. Both were cooked exactly the way we ordered and were amazing! We also enjoyed a bottle of the petit sirrah, which was good, but mark up was high. Can buy it in grocery store for $10 and they charged $40!  My only complaints are that the parking lot was small and had no spots open so we had to pay to park at the hotel next door.. $6 not a big deal. Also I was surprised at how busy they were for 7:30pm on a Thursday, but I guess that just shows how popular it is! I will definitely be back whenever I am in town!"}
{"text":"My favourite keg spot for good quality reasonably priced steak. Good vibes throughout the restaurant. Free bread is always a big plus. Service is great, never had any issues the countless times I've been here. Love it!"}
{"text":"The husband and I come here at least twice a year for our birthdays!! Not super high end but a wonderful atmosphere with great service and great food!! It's a nice night out without the kids!! Join there club and get a free meal on your birthday!! :-) LOVE IT!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I celebrated our anniversary at the keg.. I have to say that it was literally the best experience I have ever had in a restaurant!! The waiter Ryan was awesome.. He kept my glass full at all times.. He suggested the best piece of meat..and was spot on.. I was going to the washroom and observed Bob.. The big guy in charge of the food as it was ready to come out to the tables.. He was carefully inspecting every plate.. They gave us an awesome desert and even made us a anniversary card!!! I was really impressed.. We will never celebrate our anniversary any where else..

{"text":"Very nice atmosphere, and GREATservice.  Everyone is extemely attentive and responsive.  A quality experience."}
{"text":"the keg rocks always where ever i travel....love it - can't get enough of the homemade bread."}
{"text":"Great steak house.  We went for my husband birthday.  Service was awesome, food was delicious and the atmosphere was very nice.  Love this place."}
{"text":"The food is good. However the manager seems to be a high school drop out. Not sure how he got the manager position. I guess if you kiss the cook's ass long enough then you automatically get promoted.  This douchbag thinks he owns the restaurant. He was very cocky. I'll never eat at this location again. After reading multiple reviews about this location I noticed several others had similar experiences with the horrible customer service. Not what one would expect from a manager. Should have gotten his name..he was the manager on sat night - 12/20/14"}
{"text":"Great service, I didn't get steak from here (yes, I know...a steakhouse), just got the Zesty Thai Salmon. The salmon was awesome with the chili mayo, baked potato, and asparagus. Can't wait to go back to try their other dishes.

Thank you Kathy (owner) for taking the time to send me the name of the dish! Had to update this review and rating because of it :D"}
{"text":"Best steak you'll ever taste. Love the atmosphere and service is always great. Prices may be a little pricey but definitely worth it. Never had a bad meal at the Keg. If you're looking for a great steakhouse with an awesome atmosphere, the Keg is the place to go. Can't go wrong. :)"}
{"text":"I love the hell out of some steak! That being said, I'm giving this place 4 stars for their food and the extra star by itself for their service. 

I went here with a group of friends for their birthday dinner (a party of 10) which was not a problem at all. The restaurant was very nice and at the risk of being cliche and corny - had a great dinner ambiance. It's not too dimly lit and tables are far away enough for you to have some space with your party. I've been cursed with excellent hearing and being easily distracted with background noise, which means I can usually pick up on couples fighting at their dinner table right away. Though it can be quite entertaining, it is also very annoying. 

The food was excellent and our entire party enjoyed their meals as well. I ordered a bruschetta appetizer, caesar salad, and the top sirlion with garlic mash. Our server was excellent and very attentive to our party...then to top it off they gave the birthday guest free dessert along with a birthday card from the staff. It was a small gesture, but certainly appreciated! I will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"The wife and I went for a bite and I was surprised at the food, we used to frequent City Hall and this is dang close for a third the price."}
{"text":"Food was really good. Service was also great. Atmosphere was not what I was expecting. Kinda throws the vibe off a bit."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  We usually sit in the bar.  Happy hour is great.  They have an orange cocktail that's pretty yummy.  They have 9 ounce pours for wine too which is always a plus.  Good customer service.  I've never had to wait for a drink or to order.  Very attentative."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed our experience at The Keg. The service was good and three out of four of us enjoyed the food.

Unfortunately, my mother did not enjoy her sirloin and said it was tough.

I'd definitely give this place a try but be prepared for your bill as the four of us spent almost $200 on dinner."}
{"text":"Good happy hour with large portions. Try the margaritas"}
{"text":"Great steak and awesome twice baked potato. Service was outstanding and very friendly. Ladies are quite beautiful as well. Oh my...."}
{"text":"I love this place! The wait was less than 10 minutes,  the staff was knowledgeable and we got our food right away. 

I ordered the bacon wrapped chicken which was juicy and tender. The roasted garlic mashed potatoes were the best I've ever tasted and the orange scicle martini was very good. 

I plan to come back soon."}
{"text":"this used to be my fav steakhouse..until today. i had a korean friend who never been to the US, so we decided to take her to get some american steaks, so we went to the keg. there was a lot of ppl cause it was sat, took about 30+mins to get the food but that was understandable. but the food was not wat i expected as i had before, i ordered a medium rib steak , but it came out well done and burnt on the edges/bones. tasted bad but i kinda finished it cause i dont wanna bother to wait another 30mins to wait. my korean friend also ordered a medium steak but also turned out well done. the service was good they made her a better one and wrote off it from the check. im not giving up yet though cause this is still a pretty good place to eat, maybe next time when i visited here and the steak is good i will give more stars"}
{"text":"2 stars for food, but 4 stars for service.

I was so excited to try this place (we've only been to the Leslie location), particularly the spacious patio. But it was way too hot and we ended up inside, which is not bad but given how gorgeous the summer has been in Toronto, seemed like a waste. It's disappointing since this is not a problem at some other patios in the area, with better shading and mists over tables... 

Anyway, our waitress was great and attentive. The steak was good, like previous keg steaks I've had. However, the vegetables side option consisted of the saddest looking boiled asparagus and mushy peppers, both flavourless. My husband got fries and the portion was smaller than expected, and not at all crispy. I showed a pic of my meal to friends and they thought it was a home cooked meal.

Too bad since it's in such a good location."}
{"text":"Great service and good food. Try the French martini, simply delicious and as a mom to two kiddies under 3 just what you need to wind down and start your meal! 

Now, my only gripe is that the main hostess was wearing a dress that barely covered the goods. Sorry, so not classy for a place trying to give out a more upscale chain vibe.  I'm by no means a prude but come on yes you're young and cute but there is a time and place to wear a dress you can't bend over in and it's not here."}
{"text":"Ordered a medium rare prime rib and it was too dry, don't think I'll be back anytime soon...maybe it was because it was the middle if the week......."}
{"text":"Sadly, me and my girlfriend ordered our usual Ribeye Steak (WELL DONE) always ordered out with them cause we are busy and never had a problem with these guys. I raved about this location being better than the one at Tempe Market but tonight was a huge disappointment. We live only minutes away from this location and when we got home I noticed blood on the top part of the steak so I got a knife and pressed on the top of the steak it didn't have the \"bounce\" that a well done steak should have. Cut open my girlfriends as well and the same. Mind you she is pregnant so that's why the Well Done. But the steak wasn't just the one, the mashed potatoes were literally watery and slimy. Again we have ordered out from here and never had an issue with our to go orders until tonight.  Asked to speak with a manager/supervisor and they took my information and said their Manager will contact me tomorrow. This steak was suppose to be for our celebration actually feeling baby's first movement but now we are well pretty upset that we paid $80 just to come home and pre-heat our oven to finish something that should have been done right in the first place. A huge fail, so with that I give you (1) star. Due to their policy with the food leaving, the lady said they can't do much other than tell the manager to call me back, I'm sure for nothing more than to apologize. For $80 the steaks should have been properly cooked to order and not slimy mashed potatoes. Anyhow let's see if this manager contacts us tomorrow. SMH"}
{"text":"My friend took me there since I wanted steakhouse.  Pretty humid that day even at 630 pm on not busy Sunday night. I figure 2 hours should be enough time,  since we have to drive back to LA.  Walk in n waited for someone to seat us.. But  no one even greet us even they see us. We have to grab one of waiter n asked to be seated. . They told us anywhere on outside patio. We r party of 5 n we want to be comfortable seat down to have dinner. Not just happy hours food that your could seat round  outdoor patio furniture with lower table that have to bend over especially when I am wanted to have steak. Most tables r set up for 4.. We have to pull the tables together ourselves.  Waiters dont even bother to help us.

Waited another 10 min, still no one comes.  We r hunger n tired. My friend have to get someone to wait us. Wow.. Pretty Waitresses with short n tight clothes show off cleavage. Guys are also cute too.. There r a lot pretty ppl work there. 

Finally,  we got the menu. . Waited after we figure out what we want. Again,  our waitress no where to be seen.. my friend have to look for her since we need to head back

Foods overall is okay. 
Best deal is happy hours food that is good enough for each of us get one bite.

{"text":"Sat at the bar and Courtney was excellent at recommending dishes and keeping me company.  The prime rib was excellent and the wines by the glass were very good.  The J Lohr 7 Oaks cab was great for 7.50 a glass and went well with my prime rib...their specialty.  The ambiance was dark and classy but still casual.  Carlos the mgr came and checked on how I liked the food and he was very concerned about my dining experience.  You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"We had dinner at The Keg on our 60th wedding anniversary. My husband had prime rib and I had filet mignon. Both came with a baked potato and we shared a very large Caesar salad. Our entrees were cooked exactly the way we wanted, and the meat was very tender and flavorful. Our server was very pleasant and helpful. I don't recall his name, but we told him he reminded us of Larry Fitzgerald, and he said, \"I get that a lot!\" He was very kind and attentive.  From where I sat, I could see part of the food preparation area and was impressed with how careful and clean everything appeared, and how professional the staff seemed.
The management gave us a HUGE free slice of carrot cake to take home, and I must say, it was the best carrot cake I've ever tasted. It was easily enough for four people. This place is not cheap, but for this one, very special, occasion, it was perfect. Thanks to all of you for making our anniversary very memorable!"}
{"text":"I have to update my review based on two recent visits. A friend and I have birthdays within two days of each other, and they won't let us both use the birthday coupons at the same time. Annoying, but allowable. We decided to go twice and just split the bill both times.

The first visit, as a standalone, would have been a two star review. I ordered the blue cheese fillet. The \"blue cheese\" was some unappetizing whipped butter with a slight taste of blue cheese that was very disappointing. I'm used to steak houses that have tasty blue cheese crumbles on the steak, not a whipped concoction. Their French onion soup is very good though. The waiter on this night was very phony and icky-sweet and would be better suited to sell insurance instead of work at a restaurant.

We weren't really looking forward to the second visit, but decided to give it a second chance and not order the same thing. It would have scored a four star review on the visit last night. I ordered the peppercorn steak which had a tangy mushroom sauce on top along with lots and lots of peppercorns. Twice baked potato was great as well. I ordered a side of creamy horseradish for the steak. We had the Tempura Snap Peas & Asparagus for an appetizer which were an odd choice for a steak house, but were very good nonetheless. Our waitress was attentive, fun, and knowledgeable. Just what you want. 

Will I go back? Next year for the birthday meal for sure, but otherwise is a tossup. The Keg kind of falls in the middle ground of steak restaurants. I love Lone Star for a casual steak and if I want a great date-night or special event steak, I will always go to either Durant's or Fleming's. The Keg is conveniently located to me, so there is that possibility."}
{"text":"The service there was amazing. One of my waitresses named Megan was amazing! She went out of her way to make sure we had everything we needed. Even when she was swamped with other tables and orders, she still came to our table in timely manors to check up on us. Great service = loyal customers"}
{"text":"The Keg is definitely one of my favorite chain steak joints around the valley.  Always done the way you want it!  I went during Restaurant Week so the price wasn't bad at all.  Regardless, I didn't think the price of their meals were too expensive for steaks and lobsters.  The Pecan Goat Cheese Sirloin was awesome!  

Service is always good here.  They generally have several very attractive hostesses seating you and then your wait staff is always well dressed and attentive.  They do well with large groups!

The ambience is rustic with a steakhouse look and feel.  Not old fashion by any means, but like a maze while walking around. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The food was not cook as described in the menu, had to send it back.ordered filet mignon .it happens everytime i go there"}
{"text":"I gotta say The Keg is definitely one of my favorite steak franchises.  Food is always good and the steak is done to perfection.  Along with a bottle wine, good company and you're good for the night.  Gotta come back and try out all their appetizers and next time - yes on dessert please :)  The ambience is very classy and low key.  Dim lighting and quiet murmurs hmmm?   Service is top and quick.  I like my steak with a smile :)"}
{"text":"Have had dinner at the Keg several times in the last couple of year.

Always an excellent experience. Was there again last night and once again the food and atmosphere was very good! Will be back!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was very beautiful and had an elegant feel. The food there is a it pricey but the food makes up for it. Went here with my coworkers for dinner. They took very good care of us. Steak tasted great. Try the billy miner dessert!!  I believe that's what it's called!"}
{"text":"My family and I came here for the holidays because my brothers and I are never together at the same time due to living in different cities. Anyways, the service was fantastic. But only from Brett. He was very nice to us and kept all the glasses full and made sure we had everything we needed/wanted. Very friendly guy.  We had some issues with the food causing my dad to have to send his steak back a few times because it did not taste bad. He's not much of a complainer either. the kitchen couldn't get it right. When the manager (Kayla, I think) came back with the steak my dad said that it will be fine and then she said she'd be back to check on us. at this point the rest of the family is halfway through their food. Brett asked my father if the steak was up to his liking and he told him it didn't taste good. Brett took it back and got a new one and took it off the bill and hen he finally brought it back everyone was done eating and he final got a steak that was good enough. Again, he is not a picky person. Kayla kept trying to put the blame on Brett from what we could see and it didn't make sense because he doesn't cook the food. when the General Manager, Michael came to talk to us he was completely oblivious to what the situation was and on top of that he seemed like an air head. Overall, my food was good and everyone else's food was good. The issue we had was with Kayla, the steak, and the GM being clueless. 

I don't live in town so the likely hood of me coming back is slim. I'm not sure what my parents plans are, but they didn't seem to excited to come back."}
{"text":"Just visiting the area for the football game and was craving steak for dinner. The reason for such a low rating was due to the food. We got a filet, sirloin, crab cake, calamari and Caesar salad. The sides to our steaks were good, but the steaks sucked. I ordered a medium and the steak came out pretty rare and the teriyaki was not what we expected. We didn't even end up getting dessert. The 3 stars is to the wonderful service that made up for the food."}
{"text":"Came tonight to celebrate my late birthday and a new house, one word - Amazing.

Ordered the Prime Rib, twice baked potatoe, and wedge salad. Order the prime rib medium, but I should have said medium well, for my taste. But that was no problem they took it back and cooked it a bit more. Bonus, when they brought the meat back they also refilled the baked potato and green beans. Manager checked in on us, excellent management skills.

I dont get to come out to a place of this bracket often, but even with the hiccup I will come back again without a second thought. Our waiter Matthew was amazing, thorough, provided options and helped us enormously. Matthew checked back often.

Another bonus, I mention my birthday was earlier this month and even though I wasn't enrolled in the email club (Need to do this) they gave us a free slice of ice cream type cake to end the night. 

Thank you Chaz and Matthew for an amazing experience. If I could give them 6 stars I would."}
{"text":"Lately, I haven't been the biggest fan of this Keg Steak House, I didn't get my birthday coupon until after the month had past and lucky enough they sent me one and they accepted it. Though the service the night I went wasn't the greatest and I was not happy with my meal. Thankfully they change that with the meal we got for my Mother's birthday dinner. Service was nice and helpful and our meal was delish."}
{"text":"This is a chain and I've been to the Phoenix location, Chandler and Vancouver many years ago. They're all pretty much the same so you can expect a certain level of service and quality but you'll forfeit any local character or anything particuarly distinguishing.
That being said, the food is above average. A wide variety of cuts of steak and a variety of preparations so it may take you some time to decide. They also serve some seafood and poultry but if you or someone in your party does not partake in red meat, it may be best to skip this place altogether.
Anyway, I started with some well prepared calamari. The calamari here is served with a cream sauce (almost like sour cream???? Not sure) as well as an Asian-style ginger sauce. Nice twist on this, instead of the marinara or jalapeno cream or dill sauce.
I had a well cooked baseball sirloin with a side of asapargus. I left satisified and unable to finish my meal. I will say that you get a lot of food for what you pay, so this place is definitely good value in my opinion.
Bottome line, The Keg would probably not be my first choice when there are so many great local establishments with better food and more character. However, I recall my visit to The Chandler location. I had family in from out of town and i didn't know any good local places in Chandler to visit. I was familiar with The Keg and figured I couldn't go wrong in that particular situation. That, in my opinion, sums up the best time to enjoy a bite at The Keg"}
{"text":"For a steakhouse, the steak was just okay, i ordered medium rare and portions of the steak were either medium or just rare.. The service was great and the sides were perfect, especially the twice baked potato. Just really wish the steak were better."}
{"text":"We went here looking for a great steak and we found it! My first time being The Keg and definitely not the last. The service was genuine and refreshing. Kellen (our server) went above and beyond to make sure our experience was spectacular.The food was nothing but satisfying, going home with a full belly and a great memories."}
{"text":"The Keg is good. Not great, but good. For the price I think you can do much better though. But for reasonable quality and the expected consistency of a chain, there's The Keg."}
{"text":"It was my wife's birthday. We had a great server and wonderful meal. I had the whole Maine lobster and my wife had the prime rib. Great place and they treated us well."}
{"text":"I love the Canadian Dollar so much! I managed to have an $80 meal for around $60 and I couldn't be happier.

The Keg serves upscale delicious steak and seafood. I was able to get a large NY Strip cooked to a perfect medium-rare, a caesar salad, french onion soup(so deliciously cheesy), mashed potato side, glass of wine(keg sized, which is basically 2 glasses of wine), and a really tasty dessert, all for a really reasonable price. 

Don't let the fact that there are multiple locations, this one being near the Toronto airport, scare you away from giving this place a shot. This American left happy as a clam, even though I didn't have any seafood."}
{"text":"I ordered the ribeye cooked medium. It was a properly cooked, good cut and flavorful. It was just a tad on the dry side to my preference but I love my steak oozing with juices, grease, fat etc. 

The twice baked potato was excellent. Essentially it was a hallowed out potato skin filled with a mashed potato mix with bacon. Then baked to a crisp top."}
{"text":"We came here for my husband's birthday.  The service was attentive and very warm, the Steaks and lobster were perfectly cooked and moderately priced... How can you go wrong?"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, the service was good, however when my Salad was delivered to the table, it had guests....fruit flies and they joined us for the rest of the meal...even as we killed them they were ever present....disappointing"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here last night for dinner. His prime rib was not very good and when our waiter asked, my husband was honest and without requesting it be sent back they brought him a new plate and the new piece was awesome.  Excellent customer service. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I love The Keg, really I do. But this past Saturday night, I am not sure what happened. My 3 stars is strictly for the food I had (not including the dessert). The service was 5 stars. 

I got there around 6:45pm and was told it would be a 40 min wait. No problemo. It is Saturday and I didn't make a reservation. 40 mins later, my little buzzer went out and bam in our booths we go. So far so good. 

So me and my friend ordered. I had the sirloin with some lobster stuff on top and I ordered my steak medium rare. My friend ordered a different sirloin but asked for it the same way. Our meals arrive and I go to dig in, but the lobster stuff on top of the steak is cold and my steak is almost well done as was my friends :( I could get past that but I asked my lovely waitress if my lobster stuff was supposed to be cold. She said no and said let me take in the back to have that warmed up for you. Hmm ok, but my steak is already well done, which means when it came back out, it was beyond done. One of the manager's actually brought my plate back out and apologized and told me that she would take care of my meal as well as any dessert that we ordered. She even offered to remake my entire meal but at this point I was said, it was quite ok, you are going above and beyond. So ate my potato, the lobster stuff and pushed the steak to the side as it was not really edible. 

I must say that the manager and our server really did go above and beyond. Our meals were pretty much free and I chalk up the food as it just being an off night. Like I said, I love The Keg and I have been on numerous occasions. I will say this, my dessert, which was the Margarita Key Lime pie made up for my steak. YUMMO!"}
{"text":"I've dined at the Keg twice and both times left very pleased, this last time was exceptional.
The service was incredible throughout th meal, the food was superb (I very highly recommend the rib steak), the sirloin Oscar my wife ordered was accompanied with the most excellent scallops I have ever tasted (though the shrimp was slightly over salted, my only critique). 
Again, maybe the best dining experience I have ever had, which says a lot. Well done."}
{"text":"GNO (girls night out) with former colleagues.  Awesome time and fantastic food and service.  I had prime rib, excellent cook, ate every bite!  Service was good the place was very busy but it was a Friday night.  One of my table mates ordered her prime a certain way but it was a bit under.  The disk was whisked away quickly to what we thought was a re-cook.  Instead they brought back an entire NEW dinner!  When we asked why they brought a new plate the manager stated \"that is the way we do things at The Keg!\"  Great evening with great friends and great food."}
{"text":"Way overpriced. Mustard salmon is weird and I generally love mustard. Service has been horrendous/rude at times. Desserts are so-so ... Go to Cheesecake Factory. Also, twice baked potato that waitress recommended was way overcooked and flavorless."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a very nice place to go for celebrations something special. With that being said the service is superior to the service at most places.

I began with the spinach salad which was okay but I felt the dressing had no flavor at all. I was excited for the pistachio crusted salmon. I was disappointed that my order was wrong and I did not get the garlic mashed potatoes. I had asked to sub the Brussels sprouts for mixed veggies. The salmon was oven roasted and had no flavor. The maple butter sauce I had in the side was tasteless as well. While the presentation was beautiful the meal itself was average.

The filet steak however was cooked to perfection. It nearly melt in your mouth. The flavor was amazing. This was what I expected from the salmon. The twice baked potato was excellent.

The dessert menu was okay but not terrific on the choices. Seemed average.

Yes I would go back but next time I would not have the salmon."}
{"text":"We arrived around 4:30pm on a Saturday & were seated immediately, there were at least 6 open tables that I could see at a glance. We were discussing the menu with my teen who asked if any of the steaks were bone-in & we said no, fancy restaurants don't serve steak with a bone because that is usually a cheaper cut of meat. 

The atmosphere was romantic & the backs of the booth were high enough that you couldn't see the group seated in front or behind you. The music seemed to get louder 1/2 way through our meal but I didn't notice what time it was. The manager stopped by once to see how we were doing but we didn't see her again as we were leaving.

Ordered:
My husband ordered the prime rib with a baked potato for $30. My daughter & I split the chicken with garlic mashed potatoes & broccoli for $22. We also split a creme brulee 3 ways for dessert & got 1 soda. Our bill came to $70. We all agreed the best thing we ate was the $6 creme brulee & second best was the garlic mashed potatoes.

My husband was disappointed that his meal only came with one side item (they call it an accompaniment) & even though he ate everything but the fat, he was still hungry driving home. My daughter & I were unpleasantly surprised to find that the chicken breast we were served had a BONE in it. (isn't it ironic?) It was not very fun removing the skin & cutting the meat away from the bone. (it felt reminiscent of KFC which I would never pay $22 for, actually we don't even ever go there) After our meal we asked to view the menu to check & it does NOT say the chicken was bone-in. 

We were also served complimentary sourdough bread & butter (we probably should have asked for another serving to help fill us up).

Overall, for the $70 we spent we could have gotten much more food (& better food) at [[BJs Restaurant & Brewery where we just ate lunch yesterday. We got 4 hand crafted sodas, 3 meals, an appetizer & a dessert for $70 & left there full]]"}
{"text":"Tiffany was a fantastic server!!! The Scallops & Bacon are WAY better at Chandler & San Tan which makes me sad. It came with some unfortunate salsa mixture passed off as cocktail sauce which ruined it... thumbs down. Caesar salad is always awesome. The Filet Oscar was cooked well and was very good. I love the Keg's atmosphere, they are all beautifully decorated, cozy and comfortable."}
{"text":"The keg is always a good time. 
The service is always excellent as is the food.
Came here with my brother and sister in law for dinner in the middle of the week.

Now i'm probably the only person who doesn't get steak at the keg... I know... blasphemy, but to be honest I'm not a huge steak fan. 
I almost always get the chicken which is DELICIOUS!
My party said their steak was delicious as well.

The service was prompt and courteous, food came out quick as well.

They only thing I wasn't a huge fan on this visit was how squished the downstairs seating was. We felt cramped up against a wall, next to other diners.

One thing I'd like to mention is that people should really dress appropriately when visiting the Keg. it is a fancy restaurant... coming in sweats, hockey jerseys and backward caps is disrespectful.
This is an expensive, classy steakhouse, just saying.

4.5/5"}
{"text":"Both the service and food were great at The Keg this evening! It was our first time and will not be the last. Thank you to the wait staff, kitchen, hosts and management for making an anniversary dinner very special."}
{"text":"After signing up for their e-mail list, I was pleasantly surprised to find a $25 coupon sitting in my e-mail for my birthday. I had only been to the Keg once before (a very long time ago) so I was very excited to try again and take my boyfriend, who had never been. We did go on a weeknight (coupon stipulation for weekends) but liked the fact that it wasn't as hectic and busy as on a weekend night. Since it was my birthday dinner, my boyfriend I got all dressed up and went out for a nice dinner.

We were seated immediately at a spacious booth next to a large fireplace. The ambience reminded me of an upscale lodge. Our server was very attentive and charismatic. He made our experience fun but not overwhelming us with unnecessary visits to our table. We were given a loaf of wonderful bread to start. Our server made awesome dinner selections, including my boyfriend's filet oscar entree. I went with the 10 oz filet mignon and a side of steamed veggies. We ordered our steaks cooked medium and medium rare. Both were cooked very well. Everything we ate was top notch!

The best part comes with dessert! The GM came over to our table and not only wished me a Happy Birthday with his adorable baby boy in his arms but gave us a free Miner Pie. OMG it was incredible!! I think the idea of giving us that kind of service was better than the actual pie for dessert.

For the food and service we received, the prices were on point. The Keg is not a cheap place but is very delicious and service was great. I will definitely return and my boyfriend even said he would return for his birthday dinner in the summertime :)"}
{"text":"I like the place when I go out with my friends. The food is excellent. The staff is nice but a bit slow. Overall, I would recommend."}
{"text":"My parents were pleased. They are the toughest crowd. Happy birthday to my dad! He was pleased with his bone-in ribeye. Steak was comparable to his, so he was happy... and those crab legs tho, flown in fresh every 2 days!!! They are definitely coming back. Calamari is a must #nomnomnom"}
{"text":"All three of us ordered the ribeye and we all agreed that the meat was somewhat flavorless. It was cooked much rarer than I asked for but that is OK. I like my steaks red even though I usually don't bother asking for it. There was more gristle than I expected. At $30 a steak I expect way better. 

Everything else was OK but there was nothing that was exciting or something to talk about. 

Twice baked potatoes were OK. French onion soup was disappointing. The brussel sprouts with bacon was the best food I had there, but the Capitol Grille has a brussel side that blows it away -- and everything else this place makes. Of course the Capitol Grille is more expensive but it's money well spent. 

Bread was bland and for some reason they would not bring us enough butter. Grrrrrrrrr!

Service was OK but not exceptional. I never did get asked if I wanted more coffee with my dessert. I often felt rushed. They weren't busy so there was no need to clear tables. 

There are many other places you can get better food in this price range so I can't ever see coming back."}
{"text":"Amazing is the perfect word to describe my entire experience at the keg in Tempe marketplace ! Amazing service ... Amazing food ... My steak was cooked to perfection and our cocktails were perfectly blended to our taste ! Highly recommend the keg to anyone looking for a good meal in a great environment !"}
{"text":"Went here on Tuesday night with a few clients. They were from out of town and wanted a good steak. I had heard of this place but had never been. The atmosphere was great and the staff were incredible. The food however was not what we expected. The calamari was over cooked and rubbery and the steaks were tough. I ordered the ahi tuna and the flavor was there but the cut was not good and made it hard to eat. For the price I really expected better food and was disappointed. Atmosphere to go have a beer is great but I won't choose it for dinner again."}
{"text":"3.5 stars, but bumped up to 4 since all of my friends really enjoyed their meals.  I had the filet, and ordered it medium.  It seemed medium well, on the verge of well.. which just didn't cut it for me.  I should have said something.  O-well.  I'd go back.  All of my friends were raving about how good their food was, so I'll just order it rare next time.... Nah, but i'd probably order another cut."}
{"text":"Absolutely great service. I had made reservations for my girlfriend's birthday. We arrived 30 min early but we're still sat quickly despite the place being very busy. The waitress was very prompt and time time explaining the menu and options to us. She asked us if we were celebrating anything. I told her we were celebrating a birthday. I had prime rib, she had top sirloin. Both amazing. At the end, she brought us the mocha cake at no charge. It was amazing. 

A bit pricy for me, but worth every penny. Would go back for special occasions."}
{"text":"The food is really good for the price. The service is excellent, I've paid a lot more for a lot worse. There have beeb a few times there was a mix up with our food or something was underdone and without us even really complaining they would comp the dish or bring a free desert or give us a gift card. It seems like they really go above and beyond to meet expectations."}
{"text":"Oh so sad to eat nothing for my birthday dinner!  Seared ahi appetizer was Ok...I have had far better.  Way too much avocado on the plate with a somewhat stingy helping of ahi. I ordered prime rib...that,was a big mistake. Flavorless, cold, fatty..disgusting. a second one delivered was as bad. The au jus was cold water with a few,dried herbs floating in it. My husband ordered the peppered steak...he,couldn't taste the meat as there was so much pepper on it!  We will not ever go back to this place, not even for the free meal given to us. Just a total waste of time energy and money. ZERO STARS NOT ACCEPTED,sadly as that is,my rating."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious. The staff was very attentive and friendly. Very nice setting. Would recommend"}
{"text":"Over-cooked steaks, slow service, and a manager that said \"sorry\" but clearly didn't care on a busy night at the restaurant.  It says \"steakhouse\" in your name people!  A medium steak shouldn't be brown in the middle...

I can deal with food mistakes or issues, but that's when management can step in and make you a lifelong customer or let you leave unhappy.

Thanks for messing up date night!  :("}
{"text":"Update:  After talking to the general manager at the Gilbert, AZ Keg location I previously went to....I realized that his level of passion for his work...for his establishment was enough to get me to give it another go.  His regard for customer service is admirable.  You have to appreciate a business that goes the extra mile to make sure you're satisfied...or even more...with what they have to offer.

4/5 means I'm a fan...and yes I am!  Thanks Keg"}
{"text":"The Ahi wraps were good, however my spouse ordered chicken with ribs and that's not what came.  When we told the waiter of course he was willing to return it but I didn't want to wait another 30 min for the correct entree to arrive. So we accepted it.  We shouldn't have.  Instead of chicken and ribs just a small chicken was served with potatoes that had a ton of bacon.  The chicken was overcooked and never in our dreams would we have ordered anything with bacon.  The place was not busy and we expected the order would be correct but it sadly wasn't.  Why wouldn't the waiter at least have offered a choice of baked potato, or sweet potato, or twice baked potato?  The salad was good and my ahi was good but the chicken plate that should have been chicken and ribs was a sad sight.  White chicken, with a big blob of white potatoes on a big white plate.  Not attractive nor did it taste good.  Not so sure we want to risk that again."}
{"text":"Great steaks and drinks. This is a common meeting place when I am in town on business. The food is almost always great and rich with flavour. 

The wait staff is always helpful in making the experience memorable and also ready to help an indecisive dinner.

Prices are a bit steep for the average dinner but it is a steak house."}
{"text":"Second time my wife and I have gone there and always good service and my filet was done exactly as i wanted."}
{"text":"I love this place so much!  Love getting the prime rib and king crab leg combo.  This is the place my fiance and I go when we really want to have a European type dining experience (i.e no rush, 2 hour laid back meal).  Service is always great, aside from the one time we had a drunk server:)  They could have a bigger wine list, but I always find something I like.  I highly recommend coming here for date night."}
{"text":"Christmas Eve dinner was great from the Calamari appetizer to the superb Prime Rib dinner. The meat was so tasty and tender I would recommend it. Ryan was our server and he was great. He kept coming back to refill our drinks, very friendly and courteous. Restaurant was packed at the time and was not noise at all."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and I have to admit the food was deliciously seasoned overall. But 1/3 of my steak was fat and my first bite was just that, only a huge glubule of fat. For a steak house to have horrible steak is very disappointing. Prices are fairly inexpensive, but due to the poor quality it seems on point.
I can't say it's worth visiting in the future as the experience was very disappointing and our server quickly covered it on my plate with a napkin and pretended it never happened... lol
Food quality has unfortunately decreased."}
{"text":"We were staying at a hotel nearby and decided that we wanted to try the Keg out here. What an amazing experience. The place was packed, you could barely navigate a clear spot in the bar. But they were able to accommodate us and within five minutes we were seated. The food was exceptional, server attentive and very engaging. I would say this location proved what this chain is about, great service and exceptional food. Our steaks were cooked to perfection and the sides well seasoned."}
{"text":"Manager addressed our concerns. I respect a company who cares about their patrons opinions and feelings."}
{"text":"We had dinner here last week for my birthday. Sign up for their emails, and you get a $25 gift card for your birthday. It's a great deal! 

BEST FILET MIGON THIS SIDE OF THE MISSISSIPPI! 

The twice baked potatoes will make you wanna jump out of your booth right into a praise break! 

Even the wedge salad is blessed and holy! SHUNDA!!! 

This evening was made even more special by the amazing service of Cody and the manager on duty. They were VERY professional and friendly. Went out of their way to make the night special. 

We will be back before my big 30!"}
{"text":"The Keg has been a yearly visit (sometimes two) for most of my life, so it has a 'charm/memory' factor.  The new(er) Sherway location is one of the nicer ones I've visited.  The other Etobicoke location was kind of dumpy, so this is welcomed.  Although the older had more character...  This location has a really nice rooftop patio, it's very clean, well organized."}
{"text":"Our waiter and the staff sure aimed to please. My mate liked his prime rib but elsewhere it's been better. I chose the artic char and needed to send it back since it was over cooked. All the veggies were nicely done, especially the cauliflower mash. I got a complimentary B day choice and the key lime was ok, but that was super nice of them and a B day card awaited me too, very sweet. 

The service was great."}
{"text":"Tried this tonight for our anniversary. We shared the ribeye for two special, which is a 16oz bone-in ribeye. We weren't impressed with the steak at all. It didn't have any seasoning and the med-rare was really rare. The twice baked potato was the best part of the meal. I'd give it 5 stars for service. Our waitress was awesome and brought us a free desert for our anniversary.  The food did not live up to the price."}
{"text":"3 words - s car go

one of the few places that serves it and they do a bang up job
throw in a Manhattan and I'm happy"}
{"text":"Always have the best experience here. My steak is always perfect and the prime rib is fabulous. The staff is always helpful and polite. My wife and I always enjoy a night out and we spend our time at the Keg!"}
{"text":"I am vegan.  I received a birthday coupon for $25.00 and took a friend there for dinner.  I told the waiter about the coupon as soon as we sat down.  We both ordered: salads and baked potatoes (I ordered an extra side of sauteed mushrooms and onions to put on top of the potato).  We also ordered cocktails.  AFTER dinner and BEFORE the check came, the waiter told us the manager would not let me use my birthday coupon to \"purchase potatoes\".  The bill came to over $45.00 and they would not honor the coupon, even though I gave it to them before we ordered.  They told me they would only honor the coupon if I ordered an entree and all of them have meat of some kind.  I am so disappointed in The Keg.  They would have received the better end of that deal had they let me buy potatoes with the coupon..."}
{"text":"Went to the Keg tonight and had a terrific meal and waiter!  We've driven by the Keg thousands of times and never been there. I would really recommend it for cocktails, outside dining and very good food.  Fun evening! Will go back!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to go there for some time because I've heard great things about it and it's close to where I live in Desert Ridge.  I met some friends from work during happy hour and we tried a few things.  

We had the crab cake and it was excellent.  It wasn't over breaded and had excellent seasoning.  I'm from the mid  coast so I'm a bit of a crab cake snob.  
 
Next up were the prime rib sliders w a u jus and horseradish.  This was a good thought but the prime rib was low quality cuts and wasn't hot when it arrived.  Not very flavorful even though the horseradish was extra spicy and excellent.


 The grilled Shrimp smothered in some type of cheese overlay was disappointing.  Little to no flavor for the shrimp under the baked cheese.  

Our service was good and attentive.  The draft Molsens were great, a nice but subtle touch connecting the Canadian link the restaurant has. 

I will go back for something more traditional like a ribeye and lobster tail because I want to like this place."}
{"text":"Another fantastic dinner! Bone in ribeye... Love this place. I eat here every time i am in Phoenix. Prices are right, staff are great!"}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service, got in right before the dinner rush....it was allllll good. :)  Calamari and jalapenos left me wanting more and top sirloin was excellent.  My coworkers agreed.  I actually liked this location a million times better than in Markham, ON (toronto) where I first found this restaurant chain.  Thanks Chandler!"}
{"text":"I always visit the Keg for my birthday dinner and they always come through but this time service was lacking. There wasn't any birthday acknowledgment on the table as the reservation stated it was a birthday celebration. The server seemed rushed and not attentive. Drinks remained unfilled during the meal and when I asked for a box a cardboard box was dumped on the table. We had to inquire about dessert menu and nothing was offered for the bday so we purchased dessert instead. Disappointing and felt rushed."}
{"text":"I ate at this location two nights ago and was extremely disappointed. Our service was horrible. First it took the the service over 20 mins to even bring us a menu. The bread came out after our drinks and apps. My boyfriend ordered the chicken and it was so dry and literally was chicken tenders on a bed of horrible slaw and mashed potatoes. Our steaks we ordered med rare and we're literally raw. The crab legs were brought to us with no utensils to crack them. Then took the server over 30 mins to bring us a check. They say us in a section on the patio where there were no heaters and we were freezing while waiting for food and check. We've been to the Tempe location and had one of the best experiences we've ever had. So we only assumed this location would be as good but we were so disappointed with everything. Quit the bummer.... kitchen was definitely not quality checking there food and management was not keeping service up to par."}
{"text":"I've eatten here numerous time and I must say that this is my favorite steakhouse by far. Most steakhouses I've been to tend to not the get the meat cooked correctly. The first time I went here with my husband I was confused a bit when they asked 'what temperature at would you like your steak'. The waitress was more then helpful on explaining what temperature equals what type of cooking. When I got my steak it was cooked to perfection. I love their baked potatoes and the salads are wonderful! They also have a great wine list and a good selection of mixed drinks. 

Also, I've gone here a few times for lunch too and they have a pretty nice sized lunch menu as well with half sandwiches and soup combos that are just the right amount of food for lunch."}
{"text":"Yes, I'm a vegetarian reviewing a steakhouse, though I have eaten their steaks pre-veg. Their spinach salad is very good and filled with goodies such as goat cheese, dried cranberries, pecans, and mandarin oranges and is only a measly $6. I ordered the trio of sides which included some mushrooms, steamed asparagus and sweet potato fries. Our service was great, which typically it always is at The Keg. Big beers, nice sides, and for the meat eaters great steaks. Steakhouses should just offer a big ass portobello mushroom for vegs."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to this location twice in the past 6 months and the service and food quality have been top notch.  They have a wonderful ooutdoor patio that we love to visit.  This past Saturday we went to the Gilbert location to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  We had a wonderful time.  The service was top notch and the food quality was perfect.  When we ordered desert, they GM appeared and told us to enjoy our deserts as they were on them, and they brought us a small bottle of champagne to share.  AWESOME!! We will go back and will continue to take our family to this location for lunch and dinner.  Thank You Keg staff!"}
{"text":"Excellent date night at The Keg last night. Large beautiful restaurant. Very busy on a Saturday night but luckily they take reservations so make sure to call in advance! Atmosphere is a little more upscale for a nice dress up date night but could also be suitable for a casual dinner. All items on menu are under $50 and come with sides. 

Our server was Alex and she was awesome. She was very nice and provided amazing service. She was on top of all the refills for our party of 6 and always checking in on us. Couldn't of asked for better service. 

They start with fresh bread and butter on the table. I got the 10oz prime rib and added Atlantic lobster tails. The prime rib was so tender and had a great herb/pepper seasoning on it. The au ju was excellent and the horseradish was very strong. It came with fried onion strings and fresh veggies which were asparagus last night. They gave you a ton and they were huge. The lobster tails add on came with 2 tails and a large butter. Everything was cooked to perfection and packed with a ton of flavor! My mouth is still watering from it all. 

My husband got the 20oz bone-in rib eye and let's just say the plate was returned clean with a clean bone. It was cooked perfectly and had a lot of flavor. He said it was easily one of the best steaks he has had. It is huge so be great to share or for someone with a huge appetite. We hadn't ate all day so that steak had no chance... haha

The food was great and the service from Alex was excellent. I'm looking forward to coming back again. Thank you for a great night out!"}
{"text":"This newer, more modern-looking Keg was clean, had a welcoming atmosphere, and quite busy on the Saturday night I visited with my family. Our night was off to a great start with a friendly server, who kindly explained the menu as well as the specials. The four of us ordered 4 steaks, an app, and a salad to share and our server offered to bring us some bread. Then time passed by... quite a long time before we had to remind her that she was supposed to bring bread while she was chatting. It came out with our appetizer and salad. They all tasted great though. 

Then the steaks. They were standard quality that you'd expect from any Keg except they had mixed up the doneness, and had forgot to top another steak with other stuff that we had ordered (seafood, etc). The mistakes were corrected promptly. It was just a little surprising."}
{"text":"I love the Keg. I'm Canadian and where I'm more of a herbivore, I do enjoy a good steak every now and again.

I'm sure I've reviewed other locations and they're a chain so the food is pretty standard across the board. I wanted to comment mostly on the service we received because it was impeccable. 

It was my son's 11th birthday and he, like his mom, enjoys the Keg. I like that our waitress was good about checking in on us, keeping our waters full and offering dessert for him. 

The place was pretty busy but she was nevertheless very good and very polite. It's instances such as this one that keep myself and my family, as customers. I couldn't imagine not visiting the Keg on occasion but they certainly maintain my happiness with each visit."}
{"text":"MMmmmm, pecan fillet with potato :) My son, had the chicken strips with veggie. I love the Keg! I couldn't really taste any cheese on my steak which I believe it said it came with. However, I did taste HP Sauce or something of the sort and delicious! I had a steak and a kids meal and left spending $35. I understand that might sound a little costly, but it was well worth it. The kids meal was $9.95 and I spoiled myself rotten (you figure it out :-P) Anyhow, I love the crispness of their veggies, you know you are still getting nutrients from the food."}
{"text":"The prime rib is the best I've had. I love the quiet and casual environment. Service us always stellar and I highly recommend for a nice dinner and night out."}
{"text":"You know how you poke fun at people who go to a steakhouse and they order something like chicken or seafood? I'm one of those people, but this time I teamed my seafood with STEAK!

They had a prix fixe menu that carried over from their New Year's Eve dinner, but I skipped over that...

I have to say, I loved my sirloin and 5 pieces of shrimp. Shrimp was done correctly - not rubbery or charred and *gasp* it was actually de-veined. I can't tell you how I've gone to nicer restaurants and their shrimp wasn't de-veined. So that alone got a little happy dance from me.

Food was a bit on the salty side, but it didn't make me have a massive thirst craving when we left the restaurant. Server was friendly and knowledgeable, which was great!

Hubby ordered his prime rib, but they didn't have it blue which was the way he wanted it. It's all good, they still brought him out some of the rarest prime rib I've seen in a long time...

For an appetizer we ordered bacon wrapped scallops. I am a firm believer of 'bacon makes everything good!' and it did. The sauce that came with the dish was delicate and flavorful. The fresh rolls that came minutes before the entree was served were my favorite kind - light and fluffy on the inside while the outer layer had enough crunch that satisfied me, yet didn't make me feel like I was about to chip any teeth. ;)

I can't wait to go back and try some of their other dishes!"}
{"text":"Wow, the atmoshere is beautiful..the hostes are lively n kind and listen 2 u!!! It was my friends b day celebration and when we came to get our  reserve table the hostees , the managers and our server had signed Ritas b day card...how amazing is that!! They checked on us, constanly and made sure we were being treated as royals......they took care of us with our yummy lobster tail and blue cheese fillet and our dirty goose drinks. Then they brought out a huge piece of almond mocha dessert cake slice gor Ritas bday......it was a awesome experience and difinetly recommend and will  return back there.!!!!
 Amazing experience,  amazing atmosphere,  and the best hostes with the mostes!!! Thank u all for a wonderful experience and night to remember!!!!!! Keep it up. U all deserve a BIG Applause  and rock on....Thank you all!!!"}
{"text":"It has always been our favorite place for filet mignon. Tonight was different. It was not as tender as usual, and the bread was a disappointment. It has always been my absolute favorite bread of any restaurant. It used to be this heavy, dense loaf of rounded bread brought in a covered basket.  Now it is a ciabatta, a squarish non dense, very huge holes and airy and light.  It is not covered and the taste is not nearly as good. Acceptable yes, but if you have ever her the previous bread you'll notice the difference. The waiter said it was changed about 6 months ago. I didn't ask about the filet. It was larger and tougher. Husband had prime rib, and his meat was a larger than normal piece as well. Not that bigger is bad, but for sure not as tender. The twice baked potato was good as usual. Overall kind of a letdown of sorts."}
{"text":"Such a nice and sunny day yesterday and we are so glad we made it to The Keg patio. We had a fantastic time, food was great as usual and ambiance was fantastic, server was a pro. I would go back again to lay back and enjoy the beautiful Toronto summer with a bottle of chardonnay and a nice thick rib steak. Bravo!"}
{"text":"Been here a bunch of times. The food is awesome service is fantaatic . There is a reason you have to wait.  

I had prime rib and lobster my last visit and it was very very good. Lobster was very good and prime rib was cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service! Ordered a top sirloin and it was really tough to cut in to it, told server and with in minutes had a perfectly cooked steak in front of me. Manager checked in with us (sweet younger lady with brown hair). Will definitely continue to come here thanks to the great service & quick attention. Recommend the twice baked potatoe, baked shrimp & the keg burger! Also happy hour is now 4-7 every day so thats a plus for beers/wine/appetizers."}
{"text":"Food was good. Intimate atmosphere. Drinks were good. That sums it up lol.

Had the peppercorn steak. Cooked perfectly. Sides were very good as well. Had a sangria....tasty. I have no complaints about service or quality of food."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE SERVICE. I walked in and everything smelt good, but first off, they ran out of their steak and told us after the fact. They never refilled our drink orders, didn't clean up our spill, and whenever we asked for something they would act like they already were getting it. They were rude. Also, my steak itself was okay,  but the bacon wrapped around it was not even cooked at all. I heard this steak was yummy, yet it wasn't. Also, we were in the restaurant for 3 hours and they never really apologized for the bad service, just made excuses! It was an overall terrible experience. I only liked the bread. Even the soda had too much syrup in it. Disappointed. Don't go."}
{"text":"Yes, five stars.  Everything from the friendly greeting @ the door, the food, the service, the cleanliness, was impeccable.

M. heard from a friend this was a really good steak place, so we decided to give it a try last night.  We arrived about 1 1/2 hours after opening, and the hostess was very friendly and took us to a booth.  The decor is warm and intimately dark.  The server came over shortly thereafter and asked if it was our first visit.  He took time to describe the menu and the restaurant specialties.  

I ordered the Top Sirloin Classic which comes with about a 6 oz top sirloin, Caesar salad, veggie, baked potato, sauteed mushrooms and house bread.  M. ordered the Mushroom Sirloin that came with baked potato.  He ordered a Caesar salad on the side.   We also ordered the Garlic Shrimp appetizer which came in this cool little dish where each shrimp was cooked in it's own little slot.  I did have a Mojito which was just the right balance of lime, sugar and mint.  

The dining manager came to visit us and welcome us on our first visit and gave us a complimentary 4 piece shrimp cocktail.  The shrimp were HUGE!  Nice customer service if you ask me.  

Our steaks were thick and juicy.  They were cooked to order and just the right spices/saltiness.  The baked potato comes with a 3 cheese butter with bacon bits.  OMG!  YUM!

We did not have room for dessert, but they do offer mini desserts (seems to be a fad -  and a welcome one for those of us who stuff themselves but still want something sweet).  They also offered a variety of lobster dishes for summer, but at a steakhouse, I like to stick with steak.  We got out of there with a $70 bill for a drink, appetizer and 2 entrees.  We will definitely go back and take friends!

There is a huge outdoor patio area (in yesterday's heat it was empty)  But looks like a great place to hang out when it cools down."}
{"text":"This was my 5th and best trip to The Keg. We celebrated my birthday and everything combined to make it special. The waitress was delightful (Jaycee?), the food wonderful (we had filets) and I got a free dessert. Neither of us especially like coffee ice cream which is what it was made of but the thought was there. Had I thought to ask what it was, we would have skipped it. Other diners comments did not hold true for us. We had flavorful twice baked potatoes and tender crisp beans with our plate, not frozen mixed vegetables."}
{"text":"How can a Caesar salad and French onion soup give me horrible bloating and painful gas afterwards? What's in your salad and soup Keg??"}
{"text":"I have been to this location at least 3 times. Every experience has been wonderful. I have had their steaks (which are melt-in-you-mouth-goodness), salads, every side imaginable (Mmm twice-baked potatoes) and their creme brulee (which is to die for!) - I went once with my friend and his son and they brought us a fruit plat for his kiddo. Really great service, friendly people and a wonderful menu."}
{"text":"Mallory, thanks for making this trip special for me and my guest!! Yes, it was Christmas Eve. Yes, it was kinda late and I'm sure you wanted to go home and yes, we were indecisive at times, but you gave us comfortable space to let us mull over the menu. You gave us great suggestions for drink pairings, and you were friendly, helpful and attentive when we needed you!

Most of all, thanks for reminding me why I love this steakhouse so much. The steak was tender and juicey, the lobster had a great firm texture and was flavorful. Our cesaer saled wasn't drenched in dressing and of course the complimentary bread was warm and soft."}
{"text":"I came across this place by accident and decided to give it a try because I was craving for some steak. I ordered the steak and lobster ($38 for 6 ounce steak and 6 ounce lobster) and my husband had the three course meal (restaurant week for $44 for an appetizer, entree, and dessert). The appetizer came and it was garlic shrimp and I just say it was delicious. I loved the baked cheese on top of the shrimp. Then our entrees came and my husband had a prime rib oscar. He said it was average. I ordered my steak medium well and it was a bit dry..I've had medium well steak at other restaurants before and they're not dry..but this place made my steak relatively dry. The lobster was really good though..I just wish they had some sort of creamy sauce to go with the lobster. Then the dessert came and we had some sort of ice cream coffee pie. That was good..I love ice cream desserts."}
{"text":"Hands down the best place to get a steak in Tempe or Phoenix for that matter. Contemporary design and professional staff that seem to genuinely enjoy their jobs. I highly suggest this spot for special occasions or even just a night out on the town."}
{"text":"The Keg is a great spot to have a nice dinner.  We enjoy it because we can get a great dinner in a somewhat casual setting.  The baked garlic shrimp are delicious and so is their French onion soup.  The steaks are usually cooked perfectly, and if for some reason they aren't, they are quick to make it right!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal!  Everything was great.  Had the filet mignon with mashed potatoes and couldn't finish it.  Finished it off with a creme brûlée... So goos"}
{"text":"First time here! Wow what a place. The inside is very nice and intimate. I didn't feel like I was being squeezed next to someone. I felt I could relax and enjoy my meal. The menu offered a nice selection of steaks, burger, fish, and chicken. I went with the Prime Rib which was very good. It had a good portion of meat. For my side I had the mash potatoes. Those were super delicious and went well with the prime rib. 

I went out of my comfort zone and ordered a wedge salad. I actually really enjoyed this salad. The portion was kind of big so I wasn't able to finish it. I wanted to save room for my prime rib. 

Chris the manager is a very attentive manager. I appreciate that he works hard to make sure the customers are having a pleasant and enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"Went out for drinks and some good food. The Bloody Mary was great and the bread was fantastic! The service was ok, nothing bad happened, just a bit on the slow side and we ended up with at least 5 different people helping us. The portion size of food was good for the price. I had the Caesar salad, which lacked any wow factor, also I asked for extra cheese and dressing and never received either. A better, more expensive version of their New York steak was ordered and was pretty lackluster as well. I won't be going back for food any time soon, but the drinks were tasty and the overall atmosphere was nice."}
{"text":"This is so petty, but it's the little things right? Why would u put the women's restroom at the end of a dark hallway and then put 2 women's restroom signs on either side of the door but not on the door! I pressed on a wall where the sign was .... Doh!
Food was delicious! I got the salmon with macadamia nut crust. Our server was superb! I can't remember his name, but he's going to Kentucky soon.
They have a really nice lounge area, a large fireplace and a lot of seating."}
{"text":"Every birthday and anniversary we come here, and every time it's excellent.  We get the filet mignon, twice baked potato and wedge salad.    I would come here just for the twice baked potato it is so delicious!  And the service, they treat you like royalty!  Everyone is so very nice and drinks stay full, I love this restaurant.   Last time we got dessert because it was restaurant week and it comes with it - so we tried the Billy Miner Pie - I can't even explain, it was so delish, and I was so stuffed, I could barely eat it, but it came with my meal so I kind of had to :-)  So good.. Steak is always cooked perfect and that is so rare, I like it medium well, and everywhere else, it comes out bleeding all over, not the Keg - they know what they're doing, and management always comes to ask how you're doing, which I like."}
{"text":"Great service always consistent, food is always on point. Not 5 stars because they don't do take out over the phone which is unfortunate because if that was available I'd be eating there once a week."}
{"text":"This Place has amazing service and food. The bar tenders always ask your name and introduce themselves. A little bit expensive but well worth it. Only down fall when going for a whisky and coke, they do not have the coca cola in Canada !"}
{"text":"Been to this location twice already. Once one a busier night (Friday or Saturday), and more recently on a slower night (Monday).

Our first visit a few months ago was so excellent. Great server, amazing food, couldn't wait to come back. 

Ive always love the keg because of its consistency, however my most recent visit was such a let down. Server never asked us if were here for a special occasion (They ALWAYS ask), happened to be our birthday. 
A small annoyance but no biggie, apps were great, but OMG the mains were terrible. Prime Rib Steak was cut super crooked and didn't have a nice crust on it (it was almost grey and wet... when I came last time it was nice and grilled), my garlic mash potatoes was half the size than it normally is, and the crispy onion garnish was MUSH.

Partners steak was super salty, and burnt to shiet. Fries were very... mconaldsish. 

Very upsetting. From my experience, the better cooks work on during the Thursday-Saturday nights. Go during then."}
{"text":"We met all of the Snowbird Koenen cousins here for dinner.  Everyone was very happy with our choice of restaurant.  We will for sure do this again!  Our food selections were delicious.  Our server top notch!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere,  wide variety of food to choose from. Great place to take a date or a special occasion.  The bar is nice also if you want to catch a game. Get a drink then catch a movie at AMC across the way. Crab cakes are awesome."}
{"text":"Steaks are amazing. Love the square ice cubes. Service was very good and we had a great time. We were seated quick."}
{"text":"My husband and I haven't been here for a long time, it is still amazing.   We had the t-bone and it was sooooo good.   Trevor our waiter was the Best."}
{"text":"I wanted to find a restaurant in close proximity to the comedy club show we were going to so I picked The Keg.  I wouldn't normally select a chain or casual style steakhouse as it isn't my thing, but I have to say they surprised me!

Our server was delightful.  We sat outside so it was quiet and comfortable for us to talk to each other. The only downside was that my poor husband was getting drips from the mister fan above, but we were thankful for the air and the cool mist.

Going all steakhouse, I ordered the wedge salad, prime rib with shrimp and twice baked potato.  I almost told them to leave the shrimp in the kitchen because I thought a 10 ounce cut of prime rib would be enough, but I'm glad I didn't because it was quite tasty! A more than generous meal that was really good offered on their restaurant week menu.

Best of all was that they offered a coffee drink as an option instead of dessert for the 3rd course!  As I'm not a real dessert fan, I loved it!!"}
{"text":"Not sure what to expect but it was very nice. It's a chain but at least it's from Canada so it's a little different. :D

The service was very friendly and attentive. The server made a mistake with an entree and he automatically comped it without us asking or fussing. That's service. The food is pretty good too and the prices very reasonable."}
{"text":"In summary: a high class steakhouse chain that is consistently good.

My dining partner and I were thrilled to be seated in less than 5 minutes at 8:30pm on a Saturday night.  We were even more thrilled to get a corner booth.  I felt like I was with the mafia.

We split a salad and a steak.  Our server surprised us by having everything plated separately in the kitchen (except the steak, which they left up to us to cut...thank goodness).  The service here is always top notch."}
{"text":"Run of the mill steak and seafood at high end prices.  Service mediocre.  Stay at home rather than spend your money here. Not really worth a lengthy review."}
{"text":"As usual another great dinner from the keg. I have been to many Kegs accross Canada. This holds up to the experience. I always take comfort when travelling as to knowing what to expect going for dinner here."}
{"text":"The food is not bad but wha't with the teeny bopper waitresses in push-up bra's. How low class can you get??? We came for dinner, not  for sleaze. Just offer a good meal with reasonable prices and excellent service - and save the supposed sex appeal for the strip joints. Sex might sell but not at a restaurant and not with pudgy stomached kids trying to act like strippers. Quite disgusting and I know that we won't go back. Clean up your act folks and have some pride!"}
{"text":"I was in town with a group of friends and had a reservation on the recommendations for The Keg Steakhouse by friend of the groups. I believe that not a single one of us was disappointed. The decor is modern and sleek. The wait staff were on top of things and extremely knowledgeable of the menu and recommendations and the food spoke for itself. 

I had a blue cheese wedge salad and the NY strip with the blue cheese spread and the three mushroom mixture. Cooked perfect to my request, the blue cheese and mushrooms were a great add, via the waiter and the salad was prepared in the classic manner. 

Great experience especially with a group of 16 people!"}
{"text":"Well I am going to write my first 5 stare review.

The wife and I ate at the Keg Steakhouse on Saturday night and had a great experience.

There was a wait but we found big leather chairs to sit in the lounge while we waited. A cute, tall, blond, waitress took our dring order, offered us menus and checked on us about every 5 minutes during the 30 minutes we waited for a table.

Then we were sat at a cozy table for two, we both had ceaser salads and the Parmesan cheese was thin slices not powered, it was great.

We had the top sirloin and I have to be honest, when the food arrived I thought they screwed up the order because this sirloin looked like a fillet an was almost as tender. The backed potato and vegetables were cooked to perfection. 

The Salt and pepper grinders on the table were also a nice touch. I love grinding my salt and pepper.

About half way through dinner the manager stopped by to check and make sure everything was perfect. This is something most places should do but for some strange reason they don't.

I can tell you we will be trying their other locations to see if the service and food at those places match what we found, if not, I guess I will be driving 45 minutes one way to go have dinner."}
{"text":"This review is a summary of many dining experiences at the Keg.  The Chandler location lives up to this chain's high standards with quality food, excellent service, and pleasant atmosphere.

We've had dinners ranging from our wedding reception to entertaining out of town guests to just midweek date nights here.  This week, we decided to celebrate Valentines Day a couple of nights early, and as always had a great dining experience.  My wife enjoyed prime rib sliders, while I feasted on a perfectly prepared 12 ounce top sirloin.  

On a par with the excellent food was the service provided by Rashad, our server.  Really nice guy.  Efficient, great sense of humor, all around awesome dude.  Thanks for helping make our night out a really fun one!

Again, consistent, quality food and service.  We're regular Keg patrons and this will continue!"}
{"text":"Been over a year since we were the, the food is very good, ordered the prime rib 16oz medium, it's itch French onion soup and a baked potato 

Soup was great, potato was large and good. Prime rib was good, a little dry on one edge. But still very good, Wait staff very attentive and good,  price for two was around 80 or so including drinks..   Very good steakhouse"}
{"text":"This keg just opened one week ago! It's gorgeous inside! The decor is very modern. Ladies washroom is so pretty! I love the bowl of keg mints they have in there! Nice touch!

If you don't have a reservation (we didn't), you can either wait at the restaurant or leave and they will send you a link to open table via text and you can check how much time you have to wait in real time. We opted to go back to Sherway gardens to shop and went back to the keg 10 mins before our wait time was up. The system is very accurate. We got our table the moment open table's timer went to zero! We waited about 1 hour on a busy sat evening for a table. 

We went to celebrate our anniversary (part 1 of 2 dinners) and the staff gave us complimentary champagne. It was super sweet of them and a nice surprise. Our waiter was super friendly. We ordered the New York steak with Caesar salad, mashed potatoes, and mushrooms. Instead of getting mushrooms, we got mixed veggies, which was fine. My partner ordered the prime rib with steak frites and veggies. The steaks were cooked really nicely. The New York had a good amount of taste and was a true medium rare. I've been to kegs before where we didn't get the cook perfectly. The prime rib was a nice medium rare and rare. Very tender. The only negative was it didnt that have much taste. The gravy was supposed to help, but I didn't really like it because it tasted too vinegary.

Overall, the food is comparable to other kegs that I have been too. Some kinks to work out though. The Caesar salad was soggy and the frites were cold, but the steaks were cooked perfectly. One of the best kegs for this! I've been to kegs in scarb, Markham, north York, and downtown.

Dessert was a billy miner pie, my fave! Our waiter told us to add a shot of baileys to it for the ultimate taste next time. 

Great keg, friendly staff (the manager came over and congratulated us as well), and nice ambience. I love that it's attached to Sherway gardens! Can shop while we wait!"}
{"text":"The boyfriend had a birthday coupon for this place, so we tried it out. I can't remember what the coupon was for, but the food here was delicious, and I'm glad we tried it out. I was expecting something different out of a place called the keg, but I was wrong. It's not just bar food. There are cocktail specials each night. The food is pretty much amazing. Both of our meals were top notch. I'd go back, even without a coupon!"}
{"text":"This place is always such a pleasurable experience.

Today our server was Teddi and she was beyond great. Her attentiveness to us and her all around service was appreciated.

We only had food from the happy hour menu today and all the items were really good, especially the prime rib sliders! The tuna tartar is a close second"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to go to this restaurant last Friday night. We opted to get there around 5 as there is little parking available any time after that. We arrived at 5 pm and were seated immediately at a small 2 person table. Our serve showed up moments later and asked for our drink order. My wife was not quite ready so he came back a few short minutes later. She order a glass of wine and I ordered a beer. He returned quickly and asked for our food order. We weren't ready but he insisted so we placed our order.

We were just about to take our second sip of our drinks, when the food arrived. The staff who brought the food (not our server by the way) had troubles putting the 2 large plates and the 2 side dishes on the table that currently had a glass of wine and carafe, a glass of beer and a plate of bread. We ended up stacking a couple of things to get it all on the plate. 

We ate much faster than we would normally do on what was supposed to be a romantic dinner, and we were in and out in just 45 Minutes... 45 Minutes I say

I have spent longer in McDonalds.

This was not a great experience and I would suggest that anyone dining at this restaurant not accept a small table and do not get pushed into ordering fast. For the money we spent we should have had a much better experience.

I have spent longer in McDonalds."}
{"text":"We used to come here a lot. I say used to because we are not coming back. We came here for dinner but the hostess was rude and she let 3 white couple before us even though two of the couples got there 10minutes after us and with no reservations. Is it a race thing? We've never experienced that before. The joke is on them. They lost both our loyalty and business. We are both Doctors and generous tippers."}
{"text":"Nice place for a bite to eat (decor wise). Went for lunch.  My onion soup was pretty good.  My burger - which was recommended by the waiter as amazing - was dry and boring.  This place won't poison you, you'll have a decent meal, but don't expect to get flavorful food.  Lastly, they added calories to their menu last week by Canada law.  They have no entree on menu with less than 800 calories! Ugh!"}
{"text":"Dinner at The Keg last night was very disappointing. I received a bonus from work after 9 mths of workplace hell so I wanted to treat myself and my daughter to something nice.  I've had steaks at Capital Grille, Fleming's and others... I was not impressed last night. We shared a NY strip with lobster tail. We had a baked potato, French fries and vegetables. The steak was dry and seemed small for the 12 oz version (6 oz at best). The lobster tail again small and unimpressive. The baked potato seemed reheated from the prior day. The fries served in a bowl were greasy as you made your way to the bottom of the bowl. The only thing I enjoyed of my dinner...the 3 dollar serving of vegetables and the free bread. Yet, I paid $69 including tip. Expensive Lesson learned."}
{"text":"Came here one Thursday for happy hour with my co-workers. I ordered a mojito, orange peel martini, garlic shrimp (I believe) appetizer, and bacon wrapped scallops for about $32 total. The drinks were pretty weak, but had a lot of flavor. The appetizers were okay.. The garlic shrimp were way too oily and had a strong garlic taste and the scallops were okay. Two Thursday's before we went to Bar Louie which is wayyyyy better and their happy hour prices are a little better also. Overall a decent place if you want to impress someone."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for years and probably 3-4 times a month over the last year.  My boyfriend and I get takeout mostly.  The service is usually fine, but the food has steadily gone down hill.  You guys can do much better.  The steaks are hard to chew, even the filet is not that tender.  The ribs are often charred to the point they're bitter and dry.  I get the supreme chicken a lot and once it was so dry that the chicken was flaking off in layers.  I showed the manager a photo of it (it was takeout) and he did nothing to try and make it right.  We got a random kitchen bag of rotten coleslaw in one of our takeout bags and one time I saw a cockroach run across the bar.  I'm pretty sure the bartender alerted the manager because I saw them talking and pointing to our large party table later in the evening and we got three free desserts.  I wasn't about to ruin dinner for our party of like 15 people over one German cockroach because I'm pretty laid back.

Anyway, you guys really need to step it up over there.  Start cooking better food, clean up the place and be more consistent with your food and takeout orders.  You want to be upscale?  Try harder."}
{"text":"Addy glad Lobster Summer is back! The lobster gratinee is incredible! Also the fresh-baked bread is a little more crusty than last time, which I absolutely love. Prime rib was fabulous as well. All in all a fantastic dinner, and a bargain with my birthday certificate!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love The Keg. Great food great ambiance.  This is our go to birthday celebration place."}
{"text":"This place is the spot if want a good staek tho sis the spot but bring your wallet the prices are high but u get what you pay for ..good good service ..."}
{"text":"LOVE this restaurant!!! Our first date was here and we got engaged here! Everything is great about this place. The food is amazing, atmosphere is nice, service is awesome. They know how to treat their customers and we are always coming back because of it. The Keg is the only restaurant I know of where you get a FREE dinner for your birthday. We love coming here with friends and on date night!"}
{"text":"Went to the Keg for my husbands birthday.  Our server was Brian and was very attentive and informative.   I asked him many detailed questions regarding the menu and he was very knowledgeable and helped me decide.  I finally decided on the Rib steak and it didn't disappoint and my husband decided on the prime rib yummy.  We asked for European service (slow) and it was a perfect romantic evening.

It was restaurant week so Appetizer baked garlic shrimp wonderful and we took his advice and dipped the bread into the sauce yummy and for desert Spanish Coffee a nice touch."}
{"text":"Our first try and it was a HOMERUN!  

Service, atmosphere, and food were all on point on a busy Saturday night.  We didn't wait for a patio table-that would have been an hour, but decided to sit at one of the large bar tables instead.  Since we were lucky to be seated right away, we weren't worried about waiting a couple  minutes for a clearing...

We tried the bone in rib steak (amazing!), the wedge salad (fabulous if you like a wedge), the calamari (NOT salty like most places), and the French onion soup (my favorite thing just about everywhere, the Keg did it well).  I think that for the variety we tried, the consistency across the board means that the restaurant has it down.  You won't be disappointed if you try this location!

The only problem is, what do we try next time we're in?  :)  I'm looking forward to it, I think next week sounds good...Our server was WONDERFUL.  (Friendly, non-pushy, happy and just the right amount of attentive.  I'm sorry I can't remember her name, but I'll know her next time we're in.)

Two thumbs up!  Thanks to all!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat for a fancy dinner or a night out! I went here for my fathers birthday, and we were seated right away. The server (chantelle I believe her name was) was incredibly helpful, nice and fun! Service was amazing, and food was even better. This is the first time I've been here since it opened and I'll definitely come back. The upstairs area is also an option, and there is a bar there, with large fireplaces for warmth, and it is basically a patio but with a roof. Very chic and it seems like a great place to have drinks with friends. I'd say the age range up there is 20-30's. Great drinks, great food, great dessert, great service and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I went on a Monday night so we were pleased to be seated right away. Our server was a bit slow but he was friendly. We ordered the calamari for starters and it was okay...nothing to write home about. My daughter was craving shrimp so she ordered the salmon and added a skewer of grilled shrimp. Her salmon was way to fishy although moist. She enjoyed the rice and her shrimp. I ordered the filet Oscar with the twice backed potato recommended by the server. The steak was cooked to perfection (I ordered it medium) and it had great flavor. The twice backed is the reason I'd return but the shrimp and scallop...that's another story. They were not seasoned at all...no salt, no pepper...nothing. They were extremely bland and rubbery. Next time I'll stick with the filet, potato and no appetizer."}
{"text":"WOW! Their steaks are amazing. Their Seafood is amazing too!

As far as steak houses go, I put this place up there with Morton's and Ruth's. 

Be sure to try the twice baked potato too!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food here and the Steak is prepared almost as good as my own and thats a tall order. The sides are all delicious and I have never had a bad server."}
{"text":"Didn't even get to try. I called ahead because I could tell from driving up it was extremely busy. The lady on the phone stated there was an open table on the patio, I literally jumped out of my boyfriends car on the street closest to the restaurant & quickly went to the patio. Walked around like an idiot & found NO table. When I went to ask the hostesses at the front instead of them apologizing they just seemed to have attitude. It's obviously their scripted response. But I wouldn't have rushed if it was just a lie! Not impressed. Not sure if I'll be going back."}
{"text":"This location has been here for a long time.  I dine at The Keg about once a month.  Yesterday we arrived with a group of 6, which was not a problem. We were seated quickly.  The server gave us an overview of the specials & took our drink orders.  We wanted to wait about 1/2 an hour before ordering, which was not a problem.

I had the New York Peppercorn with a \"twice back potato.  Ordered the steak medium-rare and was cooked to perfection.  Everyone was quite happy with their meals.  The service was excellent.

Despite this location being an 'old school Keg', it was extremely enjoyable.
My only pet peeve was the washroom.  The men's room only had one soap dispenser working out of 3.  .....and one tap was out of commission.  I'm used to Keg washrooms that are usually immaculate. (Sherway Gardens, York St, etc...).  I'm docking 1 star for the washrooms.

Other than that............if you're in the area I highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten here before and had pretty good meals, but last night must have been an off night for the kitchen.  The asparagus were over cooked and the shrimp weren't properly cleaned.  I'll give the restaurant another shot, but probably at a different location."}
{"text":"Super impressed.  Never interested in going... thought it was another cheesy sports bar (because of the name... ya Im a snob) but OMG... filet mignon was amazing. Great atmosphere, super clean and great service.  We stopped in after a horribe BJ Brewhouse experience... glad BJ's failed cuz I took a chance and now Ima huge Keg fan!!!"}
{"text":"TEMPE, AZ: (Happy Hour Review) I was just pleasantly surprised by a wonderful Happy Hour here at the Keg in Tempe!  I came in with average expectations and was totally impressed during my visit.  I was with some wonderful business associates who frequent this place and were helpful in guiding to the best options.

Ambience: (4 stars): Its a current, updated look with some high back booths and dim lighting.  It's a cool atmosphere and a little loud.  Formal enough but not stuffy.

Service: (4 stars): The waitress was very nice, did a pretty good job keeping drinks full and was very sweet.  All smiles and friendly.

FOOD: Happy hour menu, tried a few things:

Prime Rib Sliders (5 stars): These were awesome!  The meat was extremely tender and thick sliced.  They were very flavorful and crusted in black pepper.  The sliders were served with a Dijon-horseradish aoli and were just wonderful.  Could have eaten them all night.  On a soft roll, too, which was fresh and dense enough.  

Keg Sliders (4.5 stars): These were delicious too!  Soft, tender meat that bit away immediately with each bite, even though from the grilled look of them it seemed like I would have to dig in a little.  

Scallops with Bacon (4 stars): You get three skewers, each with bacon and scallops.  The scallops are small but taste great and are a nice pairing with the bacon.  

Shrimp Cocktail (4 stars): Jumbo shrimp, well prepared, with a spicy, aromatic cocktail sauce.  They were delicious, even though I don't normally order cocktails.  I highly enjoyed them.

Go give them a try!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS but NOT FOR CELIACS.  I have loved The Keg as a place to go for a couple glasses of wine and appetizers. Dinners are delicious, but pricey - and for us, reserved for special occasions. Appetizers are delicious, but pricey for the amount you get EXCEPT for the loaded Nachos - you get more than enough for two, usually with leftovers. Now, with that being said... I was recently diagnosed with Celiac Disease. Not 'gluten intolerance or gluten sensitivity' - but the former which is much more serious. I can NOT have anything that has gluten or has been contaminated by gluten. The Keg has a symbol next to their 'Gluten Free' options, but Buyer Beware: Most of the options are fried in the same oil with floured/battered foods - and thus, are contaminated with Gluten. In other words - potato chips, corn chips, anything deep fried, is fried in the same oil as flour battered foods. The ONLY appetizer available to me - Gluten Free - was the Shrimp Cocktail: Five large shrimp with their delicious in-house made sauce. However, there is no way to know if it WASN'T contaminated by gluten, because:  To be truly gluten free, all gluten free foods must be prepared on a separate station and cooked separate from gluten foods, and I'm sure The Keg does not go to that extreme. // In summary: It's a great place to go, especially during Happy Hour (if you're on a budget), but sadly for me, I am restricted as to where I can eat, which is NOT The Keg's fault. They just need to correct their menu and remove the Gluten Free Symbol from the foods that are contaminated or cooked with Gluten foods."}
{"text":"I won't ever go back to this place!

I was looking for a steakhouse to take my friend out for her birthday.  I wanted to take her to some place nice with good food.  My friend let me pick a spot so I said lets go to the Keg at Tempe Marketplace because we both drove by so many time but never tried it out.  

Why two stars? The first one is for the setting!  I love the look because it is soooo cozy- i felt warm right when i first got in.  The second star is for the clean/smell really good bathroom!  

The food:  besides the bread and butter- I got a New York and my friend got a Top Sirloin-  the New York was very salty and the Top Sirloin- well I can get a better steak at Apple Bee's.  

The service was ok- it was not bad nor superb."}
{"text":"The Keg has a great balance between really good food and environment but not too pricey.  The twice baked potatoes are excellent.  Service is always good."}
{"text":"Eehhh.  It was okay nothing special.  I got a mediocre prime rib, a baked potato, and salad for thirty bucks.  I guess that's a pretty decent deal these days.  Looked a lot more fancy than it really was.  Not bad, not great.  I'd consider going back."}
{"text":"I had dinner at The Keg on July 6th and my New York Steak was cooked perfectly but my friend's Sirloin was dry and cooked as Medium Well when she had asked for Medium Rare.  The problem resolution was perfect as the waiter, Chef and the Manager came out to talk to her and they apologized.  They refired a new Sirloin and it was cooked perfectly the 2nd time.  The Chef at the Keg in Tempe cooks perfect steak.....the Chef in Gilbert needs to learn from him."}
{"text":"The best steak I've had I a long time! Very tender steak and the best twice baked potato ever. Service was wonderful to match!!"}
{"text":"A lot of people are way too harsh on chains, I love the Keg but this one in particular was outstanding. A lot of that had to do with the customer service we were provided with from our server, the bartender upstairs, and especially the Host Mark who must have been dying in this heat wearing a full suit........ I couldn't even bother with one today I felt for him!!!  But he was outstanding and just because of him we will be coming back on a regular basis. The food and steak were outstanding where else do you get prime rib that juicy and melt in your mouth."}
{"text":"4.5...like literally so close to a 5.

I've been saying this for awhile but for a chain, The Keg really does a good steak/prime rib.  Like honestly, whenever I order prime rib at other restaurants, I compare it to The Keg's.

Came last night in the ice storm for a low key bday dinner with my SO.  I of course, ordered the prime rib with a Caesar salad and my SO ordered the top sirloin also with a Caesar salad.  We agreed that The Keg's butter they serve with the complimentary bread is THE BEST butter.  I also love how the bread is served warm, so the butter can melt.  AS it SHOULD be.

Salads came out very quickly.  Salad was on point.  I love the cool temperature of the crisp lettuce.  Adding lemon on that.  Oh yes.  The mains came out in a timely manner. My prime rib was cooked to medium rare perfection.  God how I love prime rib!  Once you cut out the pure fatty parts (unless you like that), each bite is tender, flavourful and oh so juicy!  No tough pieces here!  My SO's steak was excellent.  We both cleaned off our plates.  

Our server had asked if we were celebrating anything at the beginning of our service, so she kindly brought out a free piece of the Billy Minor ice cream cake for dessert!  I love this!  This is the best thing on their dessert menu.  I was so looking forward to this.

I've been here plenty of times and will continue to do so.  The Keg can almost do no wrong.  OBVZ will come back.  What a lovely low key birthday dinner.  Enjoyed every bit of it."}
{"text":"Great anniversary dinner the steaks, shrimp cocktail, French onion soup, Caesar salad and double baked potatoes ,were all delicious everything was served the way it is supposed to be served hot or cold. Our server Josh was fantastic friendly knowledgeable and attentive with out being overbearing great sense of humor if you looking for a great meal check out the keg and ask for Josh . Oh ya the drinks and desert were spot on also ."}
{"text":"Excellent ambiance. Fairly quiet enough to carry on a conversation. The hostess and server were attentive and sweet.  I most definitely will be back. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Great food... steak was cooked to perfection , just the way we wanted it... atmosphere was good... prices were on the higher side but hey the food and service were great..."}
{"text":"This was a really great dinner.  There were 7 of us in town from the Bay Area for Spring Training.  I looked this place up on yelp.

On a Saturday at 4:30pm we called for a table for 7 that night and we were able to get a table at 7:30pm.  The hostess asked if this was a birthday party and I mentioned that it was my friend's Bachelor Party.

We were seated by Chelsea, who was super nice. She gave a very descriptive and effective summary of the menu and all its options.  Plus in realizing that weren't local she gave us suggestions for places to hang out.

The steak was awesome, I had the prime rib lobster combo which was great.  When we all got our food, Chelsea came by to check whether our steaks were cooked at the level we all wanted.  The side dish I chose was the twice cooked potato (I'm a big fan of potatoes)... can't go wrong with a potato that has bacon stuffed in it.

We also split some appetizers.. I particularly loved the bacon-wrapped scallops and the baked shrimp.

And throughout the night different servers came by to congratulate the Bachelor.. all of them were very friendly."}
{"text":"PRIME RIB + Lobster (essentially a surf and turf) for under $40 ?? WOWOWOW!

Food = soo good, i got the prime rib and lobster. It comes with a side of my choice and just the perfect portion. I don't walk out too bloated nor hungry. They did a really good job of cooking it the way I wanted it. (I recommend rare that way it'll still be red.. only way to eat prime rib!)

Drinks = I got a mixed drink there (can't remember the name), but it tasted like tea and it was sooo good! They have a lot of drinks and a happy hour too. 

Service = it was GREAT. The waiter was very attentive and the food came pretty quick. The manager/owner walked around talking to people to make sure our food was good. Very professional and make you feel even more like you're in a nice place. 

I wouldn't say this is the best place to watch a game, but they do have TVs in the bar area and its self-seating there too. 

I would love to come back here again and recommend everyone else to as well!"}
{"text":"This keg house rocks!!!!! it's not only the food that makes the experience an unforgettable one, but the excellent service that makes all the difference...every time  that I've been to this Keg house no matter what I ordered, never been disappointed. Not even once. The manager actually came to our table to see if we needed anything. That's called going for extra mile, that's called consistency, that's called excellent customer service. This restaurant really sets an example for other management to learn from."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service! Absolutely loved the onion soup and Caesar salad with steak...delicious!"}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING CUSTOMER SERVICE SAVED THIS REVIEW!!

Not that it would have been a terrible review, but not a 5 star. My wife and I wanted a nice steak dinner so I brought her here because although it had been a while since my last visit, it was a great place for a steak. 

Our server, Nate, said we had about 3 minutes before happy hour ended, and suggested martinis but on the rocks. Appreciated the fact he wanted to save us a few bucks, and although I was a little apprehensive about his drink suggestion, it turned out to be great! He was friendly and attentive, raved about the bleu cheese dressing (which was excellent!). 
My entree was the filet mignon, ordered medium. Despite how busy it was we didn't wait long for our dinner. 
Unfortunately, when I cut into the steak, I just knew. The steak was overcooked. It was still tasty, but at 40 bucks, nah! I waited for Nate to get back and let him know. He was very apologetic, and said he'd put another order in and it would be 5-7 minutes. He went and came back quickly, and said he needed to collect the steak to show the kitchen. He looked at it and agreed it was more medium well. 
The manager, Taylor then stopped by our table. She too was very apologetic, and asked us if we needed anything else. We both declined. Before she left our table, she apologized again and said to pick something off the dessert menu. 
Minutes later, Taylor returned with an entire new plate and asked me to please cut it to the middle to make sure it was acceptable. I cut into the filet, and you could \"almost\" hear a tiny moo lol. I told her it was beautiful and was I was happy. She apologized once again and said let her know if we needed anything else. If that wasn't enough, she also brought us our check and said she also comped my dinner. We were shocked! The desert and short wait for the replacement was more than fair.
Nate then came to check on us and then put in our desert order. While waiting, he asked us about Christmas plans, and told us a little about his plans.

These 2 went above and beyond to make sure we left happy, and we did. Thank you Nate and Taylor!!"}
{"text":"We were visiting family from Las Vegas and they took us here for dinner. OMG! I do not even have words to express how absolutely amazing this experience was. Tantalizing to say the least. First, the service is impeccable and some of the best and most professional staff I've encountered. Then comes the drinks, yummy! 

No one explained though.. how much food you get! WOW! From the warm bread to the appetizers to the salad and then... the entrée, we found ourselves taking back to the hotel an entirely second meal! It was phenomenal; the vibe of the restaurant was great and overall, what a great dining experience.

Hoping that they can possibly head one over here towards Vegas! :) Definitely a splurge, treat, cheat meal! PS: We didn't even have room for dessert but next time, we will know better.. a drink, salad and dessert! :) 

A MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"We ate here on a Saturday night, and we could not have had a better experience. The food was amazing and the service was even better. Josh our server & Shane the manager were awesome - highly recommend!"}
{"text":"An above average steak house with the politeness of a white linens-and-wine type of establishment. 
Keenan our server was most attentive and hospitable and while we initially came in for HH specials we ended up ordering off of the full menu. 
We started with the garlic shrimp appetizer it was A-ok too much cheese baked on top for my liking. 
The prime rib sliders were excellent with the side of atomic horseradish. 
The stuffed mushrooms were our favorite, loaded with crab and cream. 
I had the bone in NY med rare and it was perfectly seasoned and rare. 
The chicken and ribs dinner did not disappoint either. 
As for dessert, we both wanted to try their pineapple carrot cake with vanilla ice cream .... soooo good! 
A very happy happy hour and delicious spot for dinner. 
I am a fan!"}
{"text":"My husband and myself are steak lovers. We are also foodies and love to frequent different places. We came on August 17, to celebrate my birthday and his new promotion of GM certification with a different chain. It was a last minute choice so we came with no reservation later on in the evening after 8 p.m. I ordered  crab legs and he had lobster I believe. Our waitress was very informal, we both sat on the same side of the booth and she took our order with her knee on the other booth. She did that the few times she did come to our table. We passed on appetizers and had salads, the food was exceptional just the service very mediocre. We were almost done with dinner and I still had a piece of crab meet literally almost to my mouth and she asked if she could take my plate. Obviously I wasn't finished. We didn't order dessert. I felt it was a rushed experience. I called a few days later and spoke with the GM, I forgot his name. He did apologize and stated that each dinner was expected to be a 2 hour experience and we shouldn't have felt rushed. He did find our ticket time and agreed that it did seem fast. I just wanted to let him know of the very casual service and rushed time, and he offered to send something to us. We have not received anything and that was almost a month ago, I figured it would be a free appetizer or a percentage off our next visit. We won't be coming back. Overall great food, bad service."}
{"text":"I have eaten here on numerous occasions. The steaks are good but the prime rib is terrific! Remember that this a Canadian based restaurant, so if you order a Caesar you may get their version of a bloody mary made with clam juice.;-)
Their stuffed mushrooms and twice baked potato are spot on.
They have a nice bar, patio seating and a large dining room. Prices are very reasonable for a steak house and the food is good."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a nice birthday dinner. His steak was cooked perfect. He said it cut like butter and it had a good flavor. My pistachio crusted salmon was delicious too!!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Keg many times. Always a nice, dark, cozy atmosphere which btw is a great respite from the summer sun in good ol AZ ;) 

For some reason I had never tried the Prime Rib burger before last night. What a great sandwich! A nice twist from the typical burger around town. Although they have to cook it well done (according to the barkeep) it was juicy and flavorful. Ordered mine with the sautéed mushrooms and Swiss cheese. Absolutely the right call ;) Had the rice pilaf as my side which was better than average. 

Really enjoyed my plate and I always enjoy the Molson Canadian on draft. To be honest, it's one of the main things that keeps me comin back. Being from the East coast, a mans gotta have his Molson !:)) 

Try the prime rib. they do a nice job. Bon Appetit!"}
{"text":"Attended a meeting this week for work and was so looking forward to a good steak. I have never tried The Keg and I can safely say I will never go back. I ordered the rib eye along with a few more of my work friends and all of our steaks were over cooked. I asked for my potato toppings on the side and never received. Very disappointing. The best part, the creme brûlée."}
{"text":"My wife and I were visiting Scottsdale at Thanksgiving and wanted to have a nice turkey dinner on thanksgiving day.  We made reservations at The Keg on Tatum in Scottsdale.

The food was excellent, but what was really impressive was the teamwork by all the staff members.  Everyone was highly professional and very well trained, even the younger workers.  The bartender made a fantastic Spanish Coffee, not something you can always count on these days.  '''The lovely hostesses wore low cut black dresses that reminded me of something else to be thankful for.  A very nice touch.

We don't have a Keg where we live, so we will just have to come back to Scottsdale again. :)"}
{"text":"Took the future in-laws and the family out to the Keg at Desert Ridge last Friday, and I must say, I was pretty impressed.  There was a short wait at 5:00pm for a table for 5, just for set-up.  Within minutes we were seated.  Service was attentive without being overbearing.  My Jack-n-Coke was friendly, the way I like it.  The gf's foo-foo Mango something or other was also good/strong.  Tasty shrimp cocktail app and a basket of bread kicked off the feeding frenzy,  both on the higher end of things.  I had the classic fillet, wrapped in bacon (!!) served with salad, veggie and a baked.  My steak was great, perfectly done.  GF split a steak and crab legs with the kid.  Server split the plate, and brought out two potatoes/sides.  Above and beyond, adding to the service.  Also ordered were ribs, delicous and tender, and the prime rib sandwich, very good, too.  It met or exceeded my expectations, and I will be back.  Bit pricey, but well within what I expected to pay for the environment and food quality.  Next time, though, I think we'll leave the kid and the parents at home, for a more intimate dinner experience.

Edit: I'm not sure where that map is pointing (near my old stomping grounds, actually, but not anywhere near the actual restaurant)  It's in Phoenix, not Paradise Valley.  Just so's you know where you're going, if you decide to go..."}
{"text":"Bons steaks, ambiance agréable avec 2 salles. Serveuses souriantes et donnant de bons conseils. Compter 30-35$ pour une viande plus une salade (tip compris)"}
{"text":"We had a 10-12 person dinner here on a Thursday and our experience was so great that we brought back another 8 or so for another meeting on Saturday. Both times I had the New York Strip and both times it was fantastic. Great beef, great appetizers, great pours for cocktails. 

Our waiter the first night was a super friendly dude who was recently married and I'm sure our tab there was big enough to pay for a second honeymoon. Our waiter the next night was a bit more withdrawn but none the less got the job done."}
{"text":"I dont eat steak but figured there are other options for me to try at this place. We went on a Wednesday night and it was pretty packed. 

The ambience has a Nice rustic feel to it. I loved how there are no televisions around except at the bar. The service is pretty quick. 

I tried their Calamari for appetizer and it was pretty good with jalapeño. I ordered keg sized lobster for entree and man that was a huge portion. I had my hopes so high only to realize it was undercooked and way too salty. I was really unhappy with it and wished I ordered something else. It costed $41 for a not so happy meal. 
Their creme Brulee is to die for, the sugar coating was over burnt which I can forgive, coz the custard was very good. Their pie is great too, the Oreo base they have is delicious. 

I would have gone with a 4 star but the entree really threw me off. Overall a good place but wouldn't go for the lobster next time. The place is definitely on the expensive side and would suggest to save this place for good occasions."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food. The steak was tasty and the wine was also top notch. I was skeptical based on the fact that its located near an airport. Definitely go here if you are staying at the airport hotels."}
{"text":"We eat here every year on or near my birthday.  The food is excellent.  We always order the Tuna Tartare & French onion soup.  The service is great too.  Ask for Jeff!  He's a great waiter."}
{"text":"Eat Good, Feel Good! That's my motto and apparently Keg's too.

Outside: beautiful patio with misters, fireplace and plenty of giant potted foliage.

Inside: Typical, classy dark-wood and stone steakhouse/wine bar decor, very nice.

Staff:
 Hostess: was cheery and kind
 Waitress: was experienced and efficient, our glasses never emptied our food was served in appropriate succession and we were not rushed from our booth.
 Manager: very gracious, came by our table to welcome us on our first visit and offered us a  complimentary sample of their Santa Fe Chicken dip (see pics) 
It was really really good, the chips were fabulous too, I think half of them were fried flour tortilla chips, I would definitely order this in its full size.

We started with a caesar salad to share and it was split in the kitchen and served to us on ice cold plates (see pics) Fresh, crisp and just the right amount of dressing it was very refreshing and perfect to share.

I ordered the Halibut and Chips(see pics)
Extremely  succulent fish in a light crisp beer batter, it was so delicious it didn't even need to be dipped in tartar sauce,the fries were well seasoned with a tender crunch, perfect.

The Mr. ordered the Keg Clubhouse sandwich (see pics)
Giant sandwich,He Loved it, although even his big appetite could only accommodate half. 

I was really feeling good by now, everything was just delicious, I cant believe I'd never dined here before.

To top it off I ordered the Cheesecake for dessert and asked for the cherry sauce on the side Mr. doesn't like it. (see pics)
WOW! So creamy and light ,the cherry sauce was a winning touch,absolutely the perfect way to end a wonderful Lunch experience.

This is now my new favorite restaurant in the mall area, and just for the record they were well on to 5 stars even if we hadn't gotten the \"first timers freebie\"

I cant wait to go back and try their dinner menu!!"}
{"text":"My coworker and I were flying out soon and wanted to grab a bite to eat. We noticed this place and turned in. VERY nicely setup. Big booths, lots of space and great lighting. Sim, our waiter was awesome. He had the greatest personality and sense of humor. He made sure we were well taken care of. He talked me into the corn tortilla soup which was very delicious. I followed that with a VERY juice and good prime rib. Excellent meal to help me sleep on the plane. Lol. I definitely recommend this place to anyone near one since I recently found out this was a chain restaurant!"}
{"text":"Had THE best steak I've had since coming here for a few years now. Skip the Filet, Bacon-Wrapped, Bleu Cheese, New York or Top Sirloin. Even our experienced server said my choice, the 20oz BONE-IN RIBEYE ($39) is by far their BEST steak. He was right - it was GREAT. I was mesmerized at the juices and flavor in comparison to their other 'good' steaks - cooked to perfection: MEDIUM-RARE. Tip: Never order a steak at Medium or above as it loses its juices and flavor. 

This girl knows her Steaks. I've eaten Wagyu & Kobe beef IN KOBE, JAPAN! Overpriced & overrated - 4oz filet was over $160 there - at least, you don't tip in Asia - lol. Save your money & order seafood if you go there. A good Texas steak is as good if not better. I've had many steaks nationwide/worldwide, including Mesquite grilled steaks in Texas. My/my mom's Steaks rivaled Texan restaurants! The Keg uses fresh Texas beef, btw. Get the Keg Classic ($46) that comes with a delicious (nice presentation) Mixed Greens Salad and their Twice Baked Potato is to die for - regular baked potato not so much. Their Creme Brûlée is only $6 and is exquisite - rivals 5-star resorts. Also, pre-register for their birthday program. You get monthly specials and Buy One-Get One FREE anytime during your birthday month. After all I've told you, if you order any other cut of steak, you're a fool. Ribeyes rule - and at less than $40 for a 20oz succulent steak, you cannot go wrong. I've finally found my steak plaice. If only they had a Porterhouse, but almost no one does, anymore - and those who do, fail miserably in cooking them. Avoid Black Angus & Outback - the worst. The Keg FINALLY won me over. I'll be there eating 20oz bone-in rib every time I crave a good steak. A++"}
{"text":"Overpriced for food that wasn't great. The sweet potato fries were soggy. Good service. Most of my friends rave about this place, I don't get the hype. Maybe I should try again, I will update once I do."}
{"text":"Went there for Restaurant Week. Glad we had reservations since it was an hour wait. Shrimp appetizer was ok but my Prime Rib Oscar was over cooked & had a weird gray color to it & didn't taste good but the scallops & shrimp were good.  Manager replaced prime rib with a steak & comped us for that meal. Steak & twice baked potato were very good. The tiramisu dessert was cooked perfect.   Good & strong drinks from the bar!"}
{"text":"I just don't get how this place has good reviews? I shook my head while reading them. We went here tonight with some family, 4 of us total. I've been here a time or two before, and was never a fan but thought I would give it another try because my mother in law wanted to go. Well..... It sucked.service was okay I guess, nothing great. The bread they bring out was stale and flavorless. I know this May seem petty, but I asked for a straw 3 times and never got one from my waiter lol wasn't even busy in there either. I ordered the grilled garlic shrimp appetizer for dinner with a side of rice. It was nothing like I had imagined. The shrimps are about the size of a quarter, if that. They were drowned in butter and cheese and were overcooked. The rice, ahh flavorless and overcooked. Gross. Just had no flavor at all. The food all tastes and looks pre-cooked, not fresh. My husband got some sort of steak wrapped in bacon and said the bacon was all fat and the steak wasn't anything good. He's usually easy to please. And while looking at everyone's face at my table while eating, no one was impressed. Just not good food for the high price. If you want amazing food, try wildfish in Scottsdale, that place is amazing and worth every penny. Just don't get how people like this food! Too many negatives for me to ever come back, no matter who wants to try it out, I'm really done this time. I left still hungry and went to subway. Much better. Try wildfish in Scottsdale, they know how to prepare fresh amazing food!"}
{"text":"Some of the best teriyaki steak I have ever had. Pretty expensive, but extremely worth it. This place is perfect for a special occasion."}
{"text":"The keg here is amazing! The bar tender knows exactly how to mix a drink and the baseball cut was fantastic. Nicolette, our server was a pleasure and the amount of pleasant attention was wonderful.

Very enjoyable for my birthday celebration."}
{"text":"My husband took me here for the first time and i absolutely loved it i think our waitress was sarah. When we got there it didnt take long for someone to seat us but overall it was delicious!!!:)"}
{"text":"The hubby and I loved our time there. The waiter was so kind and attentive. Loved our steak and lobster and wine. I will be back again during happy and review that soon too"}
{"text":"The food was good but nothing to write home about. I ordered the prime rib after the waiter built it up to be the best item on the menu. It was cooked perfectly however lacked seasonings and that perfect crust a prime rib usually has. 

The restaurant is packed and perhaps staff is spread thin. Our waiter was incredibly nice however things were slow. We didn't receive a dinner salad and instead of bringing it out late, he took it off our bill without asking. Later in the meal, I asked for a second beverage and did not receive it. 

Lastly, when I booked our reservation, I made note of a birthday and it wasn't acknowledged. Disappointing but understandable if that's not something they provide. 

All in all, the bill and experience didn't match. Expected a little more from higher prices."}
{"text":"Filets were very good as usual and service was awesome.  It's one of the best steak places in Chandler."}
{"text":"Nice intimate place, 30s and up. We sat in the bar area which was cozy. They have a nice outdoor area as well. Salad and baked shrimp were okay, but the drinks were great and the roast beef and filet were excellent. Our waitress Nikki was great and even brought up complimentary champagne for our anniversary. Will return."}
{"text":"Just had a great birthday dinner!! Every time I've eaten at The Keg it's been delicious, so worth it!! Our waiter was Greg and he was super friendly and did an Exceptional job!! Need more waiters like him  
I had the ribeye which was absolutely amazing along with the asparagus. 
Mike's New York was gone when I looked over. Lol  Thx again Greg for the recommendations. Definitely coming again."}
{"text":"In town from Calif for a conference.  Craving steakhouse, and found Keg as one of the highest rated, so decided to give it a try.  Brought a bottle of wine, assuming they can provide corkage.  General Manager, Bobby Price, very tactfully explained to me that wasn't an option, due to liquor license specs, which is surprising, but fine with me.  They stored my wine bottle in their temperature controlled wine cooler.
Enjoyed an excellent steak dinner, with wonderful wines available on their list.  Prime rib for me, filet mignon (plus some tasty bernaise sauce) for the wife, and the sliders for my 8 yo daughter.  I tried the sliders, and initially thought it was steak, since the meat was very high quality.  Amy, our server, was excellent and attentive, but not intrusive at all.  Ended up going the full nine yards, including a complementary app (bacon wrapped scallops), all the way to a decadent brownie sundae, enjoyed with some cordials (glenmorangie for me, and a generous glass of tawny port for my wife).  When in AZ, we'll definitely plan to come back here, mainly for the excellent service at all levels, along with some of the best steakhouse-style food we've had."}
{"text":"I don't frequent steakhouses too often but I will come back here for sure.  Their menu had a lot of tempting dinners.  I ended up having a peppercorn new york steak, which coincidentally my friend got too.  We both thought it was outstanding.  Everyone in our party enjoyed their dinner, although there was a mix-up and 3 of the dinners had to be re-done.  I'll chalk that up to a rare, honest mistake which they more than made up for.  My wife enjoyed the mini-brownie dessert.  I thought the bar was very nice and cozy.  The restaurant was very nice but not too formal, which I don't care for at all.  All-in-all a great dining experience."}
{"text":"The Sherway Keg is bad. Do not go. 

Let me begin by saying I am an enthusiastic and experienced carnivore who dines out at least once a week and probably once a month at The Keg.  My favorite Keg is still probably The Mansion in Toronto, followed (in no particular order) by the Lower Church Toronto, Rue St. Paul Montreal, 4th Ave SW Calgary, Whistler Village, York St Toronto, King St W Toronto and the recently closed one on West Mall in Etobicoke. I also frequent Barbarians, Black Angus andTom Jones and when with clients have been known to visit  Ruth's, Harbour 60 and Jacobs, the latter 3 joints are over priced and fairly douchey in my opinion but they don't try and hide it so its fair. All in all, The Keg has always provided the best bang for the buck and has consistently delivered on its promise of being a solid steak experience in a decent setting for relaxing conversation. 

... And then I went to the Sherway Keg.  In their favor the staff  are nice kids who where well meaning. The type of crew that wants to be liked, pays attention to their training and believe what they are doing is right. You are not going to get, nor should you expect, the tenured Maitre 'D and the guy in the tuxedo making your salad at your table, the Keg staff is kinda like Jack Astor's without the sing songs. 

The restaurant layout itself had the feel and flow of a crowded and cluttered basement church sale with the lights turned off. Picture an 18 hole golf course  rammed it into a nine hole site. I'm sure it looks nice when its empty but when you fill it up it's chaotic and irritating.  If you don't mind bumping elbows with the guy 3 tables away, this place is for you.  The bar is better than the restaurant but only mildly. The fact that most of the clientele were wearing track suits and flat-billed ball caps is easily attributed to the fact that this Keg is attached to a mall so if this is the atmosphere you are looking for, fill your boots! 

The food is Keg food so you know what you are in for with the exception of the Caesars (and I mean both the salad and the drink). It was hard to distinguish the difference  between the salad and liquid versions in that they were both bland, incomplete and very unKeglike. 

In summary, the staff will age, the food preparation can always improve but the hurried atmosphere and the over crowdedness, partly due to design flaw and partly due to location is wholly unpleasant. When you factor in the cost the buck becomes unequal to the bang."}
{"text":"I have to say the customer service is above and beyond at the Keg.  The food is amazing, the staff was friendly and fun and the drinks were yummy!  Happy Hour is the best I've found.  Next time will be dinner which I hear from a good source is amazing.  Thank you to the manager and his team for making it a great time for my sister and me."}
{"text":"The Keg is me and Tom's date-night tradition. Whenever he's in town we try to make at least one trip there. I can't say exactly what it is, but there's an overall feeling that everytime we go it's a great experience. It's a treat and it feels like a treat. We get great food, and a lot of it, we get a nice bottle of wine and a plate of sides to share and then we can just sit back and relax and enjoy it. I think the service is perfect too - waiters are attentive without hoovering. Anytime something goes slightly off, like when the bottle of wine we ordered was out of stock, they always go out of their way to make it better by offering us a desert on the house - which is just really nice. Not that things go wrong very often and when they do it's always something really small. It might be a chain but it doesn't feel that way, it feels special and delivers a quality experience."}
{"text":"I was surprisingly disappointed last night as my husband and I ate at The Keg for our 36th wedding anniversary.  We have eaten at The Keg before and loved it, which is why we chose to return.  We were seated at a  wonderful corner table with round seating just for the two of us.  The waitress and all other staff were efficient, courteous and friendly, yet professional.  Our issue was with the food, and specifically with our entrees.  First off, The Keg had a weird menu that night, and I think it's temporary, where the only choices were crab and steak.  I chose the Dungeness Crab ($31) and my husband had New York Steak embellished with crab and other seafood ($33).  My crab was a lot of work to crack open and all, which for some reason I just didn't remember I'd be doing that when I ordered it.  So I was up to the task, but the crab meat inside was just very mediocre and a bit discolored....measly, not plump and luscious.  The garlic potatoes accompanying my crab were dry, and I had to keep taking drinks of water between each bite.   My husband's steak was the worst.  It was tough to chew (even though it was medium rare) and seemed to be fettered with some kind of gristly meshing.  We purchase our beef from a frozen foods delivery truck to eat at home.  Our beef is at least 50 times better than what we ate at The Keg.  The Keg was aware it was our anniversary, as was our waitress, yet nothing special was done as it normally is when we go out to celebrate something special.  Usually restaurants (like Flemings, Va Bene, and Lon's) will bring a special little dessert or chocolates for us to share to commemorate the occasion.  I don't think we'll be returning to The Keg for quite awhile now.  There are so many other wonderful restaurants out there."}

Yelp Review
The Keg: Steakhouse & Bar
Chandler AZ
3065 W Chandler Blvd, AZ 85226

My first time at The Keg: Steakhouse & Bar was by far the best experience i have had in a restaurant. Luckily, a friend of mine invited me to celebrate her birthday and chose this lovely place. Before my arrival I reviewed the reviews that they received from former guests, which gave them a total of 4 out of five stars, but I would give them that extra star and then some if I could. I arrived a couple of minutes early to see the place for myself, relax at the bar and got a couple a drinks and snacks while I waited.
A soon as I took one step out of the parking lot the door was wide open, and I was immediately greeted by the friendly hosts and one of the managers. When walking into The Keg I could feel a business casual feel in a classy warm ambience. Each server, bar and diner, were dressed clean and proper. The bartender was very social and had an outgoing personality as expected and made my wait enjoyable. The bar was definitely a casual bar to go to and as for the diner, it has more of a classy feel when seated.
The food at The Keg was exceptional, everything was cooked to perfection. Their wine selection was broad and had a great variety to choose from. I ordered an appetizer, recommended by the server, called the tuna tartare to start off my dinner. The prime rib was what they are known for and I could see why. The prime rib I ordered came out fresh and at a perfect medium rare (Careful with the horseradish. It's atomic!). the accompaniment that came along with the entrée was the twice baked potato that I highly recommend.
Service we received was exceptional. The servers that we had were very knowledgeable about their menu. Anytime I had a question they would answer without hesitation. We waited a bit long for our food, but they were experiencing high volume, which I expected on a Saturday night. There was an incident in which one of our members in our party that received her steak overcooked and was sent back. The manager took care of the situation and came back a couple of minutes later with a brand-new plate and new steak. Since it was my friend's birthday the same manager came out with a house made dessert called the Billie Miner pie that was on the house. We also ordered the carrot cake and the brownie sundae; all 3 desserts were delicious. 
Pricing of this restaurant was a bit pricey to say the least, but it was worth it. When visiting The Keg, I recommend getting the Keg Classics. The Keg Classics is like a combo meal here and you get to save a couple of dollars. 
The Keg is now one of my favorite restaurant to go to. Ill recommend this restaurant to all my friends and family that is planning to celebrate a special occasion, holiday, or impress a date. Definitely will come back. [511 words]"}
{"text":"Very good quality cow for us cow lovers. 

Comfortable, but upscale ambiance.

Service night 1 was outstanding.

Service night 2 was mediocre. 

Ok wine list, but nothing to write home about.

Vegis well cooked - not overdone."}
{"text":"We had a good team event here our last night in town. Overall the food was very good, but a couple of issues kept it from being excellent.  I ordered my steak medium and it was brought to the table well-done. They graciously took it back and brought another out very quickly. They were apologetic and very responsive, but the second one was about as well-done as the first. It was seasoned well with a nice peppery crust though. Also, the asparagus had no seasoning.  Appetizers, other steaks I tried from colleagues plates, and drinks were very good. Service was excellent.  This could have been a 4 star experience had it.not been for the steak temp, but they excelled in other regards. I'd advise not ordering the peppercorn strip because it is cut thin and apparently makes it difficult to get doneness  right for them."}
{"text":"My wife and i went on our first date 5 yrs ago to the Gilbert Keg. 8/13/16....we headed back and sat at the same table and had a great meal. My Baseball top steak was delicious and my wifes filet was perfect. The staff was on point and Matt B did a fine job taking care of us. Our coffee ice cream dessert was top shelf. 5 yrs later and still great !"}

Any problems or mistakes are unusual - and when they occasionally do happen, they're resolved quickly and graciously. This last weekend, our waiter Spencer took great care of us, and we enjoyed a delicious steak dinner and fantastic desserts. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I am not sure what happened to this place. The last 2 times I dined out here have been horrible. This last visit was extremely disappointing. I ordered the usual bacon wrapped filet minion asked to be prepared medium. The steak came out more like well done. No big deal. We all make mistakes. I asked the server to see what he thinks and he agreed sent it back and had a new filet brought out. The presentation was extremely poor the bacon wasn't not even close to being called wrapped. And the steak was pretty much medium well. I just dealt with it this point because it was clear they didn't care to bring out a 40 dollar steak looking like this for the 2nd time. Please see what they call \"bacon wrapped fillet minion\". Picture included"}
{"text":"My husband made reservations for our family for a Friday night to celebrate our sons last night home on leave before he returned back to his base. Danny Sanchez took the reservation and told my husband to ask for him when we got to the restaurant.  When my husband asked for Danny Sanchez, he came over to our table to shake our sons hand and to thank him for his service.  Customer Service was Awesome, the food was fantastic. We will definitely be back! Thank you for making our last night with our family together a memorable event. Chad and Candi Carter"}
{"text":"Food was outstanding, delicious.  Our server Nathan was super kind, great customer service and his suggestions superb. Bill, the manager made rounds and greeted and checked on our satisfaction. Customer service goes a long way. Thank you."}
{"text":"I like to sit in the bar and have their Caesar salad. It's my fave Caesar! You can add steak or chicken but it's delish with or without meat"}
{"text":"I was planning on going to The Richmond Station for dinner in Downtown Toronto. However, I decided to just eat near my hotel so I dropped off at The Keg. 

I came in and was kindly greeted by the hostess who directed me towards our seat. Soon after that, Klidi, our server came over. 

Klidi was a nice guy and a pretty good waiter. He was very polite and courteous. I had a nice conversation with him about the American Political System as well! 

For my meal, I decided to start off with the lightly fried calamari and than get a hamburger for my entree. The hamburger was recommended by Klidi as it was one of his favorite items. 

My calamari came out very fast, but at the same time the bread came out. I found that a bit odd. 

Anyway, the calamari was really good! I especially liked how it was only lightly fried so I could actually taste the calamari!

I ate a bit of the bread and it was really good. The inside was nice and soft while the outside was crispy, but not too hard.

However, before I had fully finished my meal, the staff dropped off my burger. I felt very, very rushed. 

The burger itself was pretty good and had a big, fluffy bun on top! The burger was very nicely done and had an almost steak style taste. 

Once again, I felt pretty rushed when being given the dessert menu. 

The dessert menu itself was not too extensive, but did have a brownie sundae that I decided to get. 

The brownies were really good and topped off with creamy chocolate sauce and whipped cream. Of course, it also had ice cream, but I did not love it. 

The Keg also has a sport's bar and outdoor seating options. If watching the Blue Jay's game you can actually see an add for The Keg behind home plate.

Also, at checkout make sure to get some of their chocolate mints. 

Altogether, I had a nice meal at The Keg and I would recommend restaurant!"}
{"text":"My date & I visited The Keg @ the Sherway Mall a few weeks ago and it was hands out the best restaurant experience I've ever had in my entire life. 

We got seated right away but our server didn't arrive at our table for about 10 minutes. Before we even noticed his absence we were greeted by a very friendly man in a suit whom was assumed to be the manager apologizing intently for the \"long\" wait time. He offered us free beverages and appetizers for the inconvenience.  

We ordered the escargot which was incredible. I had the Thai Chicken. As always everything on the plate was cooked and seasoned perfectly.My date had his typical New York striploin steak with garlic mashed potatoes. He said it was perfect.   

During our meal the manager returned about three times to apologize again and to check in on our Keg experience. He explained to us how important it is for his customers to leave the restaurant with nothing but good things to say. He definitely made this happen for us! He offered us free dessert as well so of course we obliged.  

Creme Brulee. Need I say more? We left a hefty tip to make up for all the free food we received. We will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Best steaks in town that I've found. Great service! The only negative would be that my 90 year old grandmother loves this place ..but it's a little dark for her eyes. Overall it's super excellent!"}
{"text":"It seems these restaurants are all over Canada.  Came here on a weeknight to have dinner with family.  It was not too busy and service was pretty quick.

Food: My husband had the peppercorn steak and I had the Sirloin Oscar.  Overall, the steak itself was pretty good.  The garlic mashed potatoes weren't as garlicy as I was hoping for, but it was fine.  The toppings for the steak were alright.  For the oscar, I had maybe 2 pieces of shrimp and 2 pieces of scallops that had no seasoning on them.  They were covered in Bernaise sauce that was just OK.    The peppercorn my husband had was pretty good but the sauce with it was kind of sweet and off-putting for the steak.  For a place called \"The Keg\" their beer selection was not that impressive.  I would expect 10-12 Draft Beers and there was only a few.

Decor: It is a beautiful place with a few different feels.  Great for a celebratory dinner or a date night.

Price: Quite pricey.  You are paying for ambiance and Service, not all of it in the food.

Service:  Service was very attentive and very good.  Much better than some 5 star restaurants honestly. 

Notable Extras: Their bread for the table is very good and difference. 

It was a solid meal and feels fairly consistent from the few that I have visited."}
{"text":"The Keg was good.  Service was really good.  I had the escargot, it was also good  The drinks were ok, a little lacking in booze content.  I was with a large group, most of them had steak and lobster.  They said the steak was good, not great, and same about the lobster.  It would have had a 3 star rating but because our server was so good (5 stars for her) I averaged my review out at 4.  I will be back in Tempe at the end of April and will try it again just in case the chef and/or line cooks had an off night.  Will update my review."}
{"text":"We made our reservations through Open Table. On the reservation form it asks if it's a special occasion and I noted that is was our wedding anniversary. We were on time and were seated in a booth against the glass that's separates the dining room from the kitchen. Nothing special. When the waiter came to our table, he asked if we were celebrating a special occasion which we confirmed was our anniversary. The wine was brought promptly as was the appetizer. We had the calamari which was also nothing special and rubbery. I am deathly allergic to peppers and there was nothing on the menu stating that peppers would be on my plate. They removed my plate but left my husband's and told me it would take about 5 to 7 minutes to prepare a new dish for me. It took a whole lot longer than that as my husband was completely finished before my plate arrived. Not good and no apologies. Both of our meals were delicious and cooked to perfection. He had the teriyaki sirloin cooked medium with a lobster tail and I had the sirloin (medium rare) with garlic mashed potatoes - too bad we couldn't enjoy our meals together. We asked for Crème Brule for dessert and told the waiter that this was the dessert we had at our wedding. No reaction. It was served as it should be - hot burnt sugar topping and cool, creamy vanilla pudding. We got the bill and were surprised that we were not comp'd the desserts or the bottle of wine - if not for the anniversary, for the delay in prep and serving of my meal.  All in all, the food was very good, the service, not so much."}
{"text":"We did not have a reservation and did lot want to wait 55 minutes for a table, so we ate at a table in the bar area. Sunday is all day 1/2 price select appetizers and crab leg meals for $32.99 with one accompaniment. We ordered the mushroom Neptune which had crab and cream cheese. They were nicely presented and tasted good. Not much crab was in them, more cream cheese which was whipped, still tasty. We each received two crab claw clusters and they were tasty. We ordered asparagus and received a large portion in addition to some green beans and two strips of roasted red pepper. The asparagus had absolutely no seasoning on them.  She brought out bread which we declined though it looked very scrumptious.

Upon completion of our meal, the waitress brought us a small bowl with water and a hard white round tablet that expands into a finger towel to clean our hands. So much nicer than receiving moist towelettes which leave a weird smell in your skin. A nice touch!"}
{"text":"My family and I were very impressed by the food and service at The Keg near The North York Civic Centre. We were there to celebrate my husband's bithday and we had a great time.

All the appetizers and entrees were well-prepared and delicious. I had a small issue with my salmon (the maple butter made it a bit too oily for me). Not only was I asked if I wanted a replaement (although I had already finished the fish), we were given complimentary desserts. AND, when I received the bill, I found that one of our appetizers had also been comped. A very pleasant surprise that demonstrates superiour customer service and care. In general, our server was courteous, attentive and responseive. We left full and very happy wth the whole dining experience.

We will definitely be returning, and recommending this location to our friends."}
{"text":"It has been 2 days since I had dinner and am still thinking about their crispy cauliflower appetizer-  yummy   Their fried calamari also has fried jalapeños with it to give it just the right spice. Josh our server was attentive and professional. 
I am looking forward to going back soon."}
{"text":"This place is Great it replaced my old Stake House Village Tavern. 

Great atmosphere and Stake. If you want a nice night out that is not over the top fancy then this is your place. The twice baked potato is beyond amazing and the stake are perfectly cooked and seasoned. 

The reason it took the place of my go to stake house is because they actually server their wine at the correct temperature unlike Village Tavern. The two food wise are very comparable and both excellent but The Keg stores and serves their win at the correct temperature and has a good section."}
{"text":"Straight up; the food deserves five stars! Had the prime rib with shrimp and scallops during restaurant week, basically awesome and delicious! So so so so tender!

Would've given five stars but everyone from the hostess to the waitress to the manager are a bunch of sticks in the mud, show a little personality! Seriously, it's like dealing with a scripted telemarketer. The desserts are meh as well, tried the creme brûlée and the Billy Miner. The style is dated, and it's really dark in there."}
{"text":"if you're looking for a really nice restaurant for a date night with amazing quality food, this is the place to go. It's a tad pricey, but more than worth it.

The lighting was dim, and we had reserved the spot next to the fireplace which made the whole setting more cozy. I can't give enough positive compliments about our server Matt and the manager Chris. Both were extremely helpful and provided really great info about the plates I had been contemplating.

We started off with the calamari which was great. Had a nice kick of heat with the jalapenos and it was paired with two dipping sauces. As for the main course, I got the filet with crumbly bleu cheese on top, grilled shrimped creole seasoned, a double baked potato with veggies and they had a ramekin of hot boiling butter and bearnaise sauce. One word, HEAVEN. My date had the prime rib with horseradish and au jus sauce, garlic whipped potatoes with veggies. Neither of us had a left-overs. The dishes were amazing.

The manager came over on multiple occasions to ensure we were enjoying our meal and greet us. I also noticed guests leaving and giving him hugs. It was great to see he had such a strong relationship with his clientele.

When it came to dessert, the manager, Chris suggested we try the key lime pie made from scratch in house with raspberry coulis and boy were there no regrets other than I was 100% stuffed. haha.

My beverage of choice that evening were the extra dirty martinis with fresh bleu cheese stuffed olives and my date had the crown and cokes. I appreciate that they put the liquor on ice and brought a small decanter of coke for him to pour at his discretion. 

Again, if you're looking to have a nice dinner out or just want to treat your significant other or business partners to a nice dinner, The Keg in Chandler is a wonderful spot. 

The manager appreciated all the feedback we had to give on our visit so be sure to give Chris some love while you're there as well!

We will definitely be back, sooner than later."}
{"text":"Great customer service and outstanding food. Went here after my graduation and they had a card waiting for me. The manager made a follow up phone call with us several days later to make sure everything was perfect. Blew us away. As for the food, definitively  recommend the prime rib!"}
{"text":"We had relatives in town here in chandler for the weekend from NY and wanted to take them to a nice dinner on Friday night. I made reservations in advance for 7pm. We were all very excited about this dinner and looked forward to it. We planned on dropping about $500 for the 4 of us and going all out for this special occasion.

We show up to the restaurant at 6:55pm The hostess handed me a disk shaped buzzer and said our table would be ready momentarily. No problem . We sat in the breeze way on the benches. We waited a full hour until our table was ready ! They apologized and we were cool about it although it was very annoying because I made reservations and this was a special night for us.

 The rest of our evening goes as follows.

1.)We sit down and a waiter doesn't come by to greet us for another 20 full minutes !

2.) We all four order cocktails and he stops back after 10 min to apologize that the bar is backed up and sorry for the wait. After 15 minutes 1st drinks arive.

3.) we start with two orders of tiger shrimp cocktail for the table . Those came out fast in 5-7 minutes. Only problem is our waiter only put in one order and forgot the other. We mentioned it and the second order of tiger shrimp came out after 10 min. 

4.) by now we're all ready for another drink. We wait about 15 min for our waiter and eventually I get up and flag him down. He comes over and says \" what can I getcha\" we order our 2nd round of cocktails. 

5.) waiter shows up 20 min later to apologize about the drink wait and asks if we're ready to order. We all want our second drink but decide to order. Two got the Filet and two got the  bone in New York that was featured. We all added the lobster tail and I added lobster and king crab legs.

6.) about 30 min later our food shows up about the same time as our second cocktail . All of our lobsters were cold and he forgot  my King Crab legs !The kitchen manager came out to apologize and comped my steak and took it away because it was incorrect . 

We had a ride scheduled  to pick us up that evening because we planned on drinking a lot and eating great food for what was supposed to be a special evening but it turned out to be a disaster. I really wish we would have picked a different spot because we only see or family from NY every so often ."}
{"text":"Great prime rib and excellent service, thank you for a wonderful experience. We will be back."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious!  Had the bacon wrapped filet with blue cheese topping.  It was perfect!  My husband and i shared the baked brie appetizer.  We could have eaten just that with a bottle of wine as our meal.  It was delicious!  Loved the outdoor patio!  We will return."}
{"text":"I always find myself going over to kona because of their great happy hour and realized how packed it always is, fortunately that day I went onto the keg here and I'm so happy I did! The waitress was super friends and calm, I felt like nothing was to rushy even though it was packed as well and surprisingly the happy hour wasn't too off from what kona had only better! The dinner was delicious and loved the atmosphere, happy to return."}
{"text":"OLE for their horseradish!!! If you want a real respiratory clean up, ask for an extra cup.

I was lucky to be invited by a friend to have dinner. Yes very pricey for a student budget, but we made it! I had one of their meat sandwiches. The meat is the target! it came with broth on a side and I had the garlic mashed potatoes. My friend had the tandori chicken she so much loves.

Service is OUTSTANDING!! 

Just wish they could put more light into it...why this steak houses have to always be soo dark!??"}
{"text":"Always a great steak. I haven't ever had anything else here. The only reason I won't give five stars is because the steak knives were very dull. The service was good. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is my first time experiencing the The Keg in the U.S.  I have to admit I was slightly disappointed. 

Our server Josh was great and the restaurant managers stopped by our table to check in at least twice.  You have to love a manager who works the floor with his employees. 

The food was ok, nothing special. It seems that the service from the hostess end could have been better, they didn't seem to be too engaged. We were sat in a location with a lot of foot traffic when the rest of the restaurant was fairly slow.  In their defense we didn't asked to be moved. 

Idk what it is but this Keg experience was lagging to others.  I would come back for Happy Hour, maybe not for dinner."}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix from Boston and first time here. White Sangria was delicious, not too sweet and not too fruity. I had the prime rib and the double stuffed potatoe. Potatoe was out of this world excellent service (we were in the bar)"}
{"text":"The Keg gets it right in so many ways, after Houston's this is probably my favorite steakhouse, which is nuts it being a chain and all. The ambiance is calming and romantic, dim lighting with a giant fire and professionally clad waiters, it's almost always booming yet never all that loud. I've had a lot of their menu over the years and still haven't found something I didn't like. Their prime ribs are incredible. Get it rare and just let all that wonderful juice run down your chin... they also have huge potatoes plus some great appetizers like the tempura asparagus, scallops and bacon and escargot. The only thing really lacking here is the beer selection, just the basics around The Keg. But with dynamite service, dishes you'll be licking clean, and an atmosphere that'll put you in the mood, The Keg earns an easy four stars."}
{"text":"We used to frequent our local KEG.  Guess we just forgot how nice it is!  We both enjoyed filet and they were as expected, perfectly prepared. The atmosphere and service is consistently 4 stars. This is a solid steak spot! The bar is well stocked. Herradura Repo flows freely which makes me very happy! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This Keg was A-OK. Was here during early part of December to help celebrate a colleague's 40th birthday.

Drinks were well-made (how could you mess up a Grey Goose and Diet Coke?) as well as the apps (nachos and bruschetta). I didn't eat dinner, but birthday girl had a well-done steak and it smelled/looked fab.

All in all - great place to dine and eat/drink! I'm just not a huge fan of chains - it makes me squirm a bit. Bathrooms were pretty modern/oversized and just a nice place to powder your nose."}
{"text":"I had my annual birthday ribeye steak dinner at the Keg. It was a $25 coupon, which was a great deal. I sat at the bar and the bartender with the beard was very nice and quick with the food even though I only had a 30 minute window of time. The steak here is the best ever! I wish I could afford to eat here every day. Unbelievable. :)"}
{"text":"New Keg in a new building.  Not as charming as the Keg Mansion downtown, but quiet and intimate seating and excellent service.  Same excellent meat quality as in the other Kegs.   There is a bar and patio (out of season as of this writing) upstairs.

Though know for steaks, I love their prime rib and their creme brulee is to die for.   Expect about $50 per person without wine.  Wine list is not cheap but it fairly priced."}
{"text":"I came to this location two years ago and I didn't went back until couple weeks ago I decide to give it a try again. The service was good, the food as well. The happy hour is great! Great Mojito! Except when you order one round of mojitos and it's one person who prepare it, and when you order another round and it's someone else who made it, and it's a different taste. Aren't they suppose to follow the same \"recipe\" in restaurant chain?"}
{"text":"Great food, great service/. We had the prime rib and it was among the best I've ever had.  Our 1 year old and 5 year old were very welcome and taken care of.  Will be back again next time to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for lunch with my colleagues and I actually really like it. Some of my colleagues think it's too dark in there but I think it adds a nice ambiance to a steakhouse. The food is always really good; I've had the sliders, cobb salad and Caesar salad and there was nothing to complain about. There's a lot of parking in the back, fast and friendly service and, in my opinion, a nice place to go for lunch."}
{"text":"Third time in 3 weeks, sit at the bar and they have prompt and excellent service. Matt is always very attentive and accommodating. 

Drinks are generous, Filet is high quality and creamed corn is excellent. 


I would highly recommend based on the attention to service, timely service, quality and portion of food, and atmosphere."}
{"text":"So I don't eat beef but occasionally I go to steakhouses when my friends are craving something red and bloody. The Keg is a chain and I find the prices to be very reasonable.  They have lots of seafood options for those of us not into beef. I have had their baked salmon dishes and they are always good. My favorite was salmon stuffed with crab and scallops, but it must have been a special because it was not on the menu when I went last night. Instead I opted for a dinner salad (should have asked for dressing on the side as there was way too much) and the crab cakes appetizer. You get two crab cakes and they were really flavorful and full of large crab chunks. I didn't even need the dipping sauce because they were great with just a light squeeze of lemon.

Service was a bit meh on my last trip. My water didn't stay filled and it took the waiter a long time to do everything (it was a Monday night and not at all busy). We asked for our side order of cheese garlic bread to be wrapped up but he took it away and never came back. We mentioned it to the hostess as we were getting up to leave and she took care of it. Waiter came out and apologized. Not a huge deal but certainly they could make some improvements. I've had better service at the Chandler location for what it's worth."}
{"text":"I am never returning to this place. We went last night for our anniversary.    I ordered the classic prime rib dinner. I did ask for medium well done.  I got the burnt end piece and had to send it back.  Who serves a burnt end piece for a 30 dollar dinner!  Plus my hubby was almost done eating before the new piece came.  Really...just cut it off the roast and serve it!!  
We went there a couple months ago and my shrimp skewer was over done.  So.  I am done with this place.  Over priced and poor quality."}
{"text":"Great service and great food.  My son loved the mini burgers in the kids menu.  Reservations are recommended as the place is super busy."}
{"text":"Why is the experience at this location never up to par with other locations.The  food should be  at proper temp when you are sitting next to the kitchen.Once again I ordered the prime rib(last time)and it was very tough for medium rare.It had a weird color to it,like it was cooked in au jus.Not something I was expecting with a signature  menu item.Wife's salmon was hot and tasted fine.Will make sure to take the ride to Tempe,for a better dining  experience.Must be the management at the Chandler store."}
{"text":"Food is four star quality, we sat in the bar area so we can't fully comment on the ambiance. Excellent steak- we had the prime rib and the New York strip. Plus they had some good red wine..."}
{"text":"I'm not going to go into a review of the food here, even though I had steak and lobster, which was incredible! The point of this review is for their bar. Since I discovered and Old Fashioned, I have been looking for bars that serve an excellent one. Well, I found my Phoenix Old Fashioned location! It was almost perfect, the only way it could have been better is if their ice were something other than just cubes. It was the perfect amount of citrus, perfect amount of bitters, and perfect amount of alcohol. I had mine made with Jameson, and I will definitely have another the next time I go. 

This Old Fashioned destroyed the drinks from Mable's on Main (Scottsdale), Turf (Phoenix), and a number of other places around the valley. 

This would make a great place to go to dinner and have a few drinks before going to see a movie while at Tempe Marketplace. I have heard the happy hour specials at The Keg are pretty good."}
{"text":"Watch out for the fish tacos!! My three girls have food poisoning symptoms and ate the same dish last night."}
{"text":"I've ordered many 6oz steaks and this was one of the smallest! I doubt it was true to to size honestly. The lobster tail was good however. Steak was pretty dry when I was eating it and I had to force myself on. Once again the lobster tail was very good and I'm thankful I had that to go along with my meal. Pre plate, I requested soup and of the choices the waitress gave me I made a selection, she came back and told me they didn't have the soup! All they had was French onion soup and that was honestly nasty. Also the drinks were good we ordered several... Our total bill was almost $200...overall for the price I feel I should've went to another comparable steakhouse if that amount of money is in play, such as Mastros or the Capital Grille. The Keg seems like it has potential though, and I would give it one additional chance to see if they disappointment me again because certain aspects of the meal were good."}
{"text":"Went last night for my father in laws 80th birthday. The service was fantastic and the food was good. Everyone enjoyed their food and they allowed us to bring a cake in for dessert which they served and cut up for us which was very appreciated. My only complaint if I had one was that they wouldn't make a child size rib meal 30 dollars for a 7 year old meal was a little over the top. With our bill being almost 500 dollars it seemed like they could have made it possible. Would definitely return though"}
{"text":"I love love love The Keg!! Classy/warm atmosphere, fun and fresh appetizers, succulent steaks (Baseball steak!!!!!), amazing happy hour, and delicious drinks!!! Can't say enough about this place! Since the first time I went, I've been addicted and have had EVERY special event diner there since... college graduation, anniversaries, birthdays, etc!!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful experience here! My date had prime rib and I had a burger with 3 different types of meat in it I believe. My date loved the prime rib and her mashed potatoes and my burger was cooked to a perfect medium. In fact the burger was incredible, just writing this review makes me want to go get another now. Only downside I would have to say was the Mac and cheese. I did get to speak with the manager and it's a new item and they are working on the item. We r definitely going back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here many times, but the experience we had on 9/7/14 was the worst. We went to use my husbands birthday certificate, we arrived after 8pm.
Adrian was our server and after we gave him the certificate things went downhill from there. I guess he must of been calculating less of a tip from the start. I was not that hungry so I ordered an appetizer and a side for my meal, my hubby ordered the 10oz prime rib. He left with an attitude, didn't check back with us until we were on our last bites, never filled my water and when it came to dessert he asked us if we had any room left. When we said no he didn't even say that a birthday dessert was included.
I urged my husband not to leave a full tip. Bill was $41.50 minus promo of $24.00 plus tax came to $18.92. He left a $8.08 tip. I hope all servers are not like Adrian, if you go ask not to sit in his section. I know someday we will return, but not to see Adrian.
Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Update 7/3/2015: In celebration of one year at my job here in Tempe I went with a friend to The Keg.. We don't go to The Keg too often but when we do we are never, ever disappointed. 
Shrimp Cocktail, Lobster Tail, Top Sirloin cooked to perfection .. omgoodness I was in heaven. My favorite steak house now.. absolutely must try. IN addition I forgot my reading glasses at home and they brought me a pair to use so this far-sighted old lady could see the menu. Above and beyond I tell you. Definitely a great place to eat and relax. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm new to Tempe, AZ and a friend and I were looking for a steakhouse last night. We found The Keg on Yelp and it had some excellent ratings so we gave it a try. I have to say it is the best experience I've had at a restaurant in a long, long time. IF you are a mushroom fiend you must try Mushrooms Neptune - I couldn't get enough of the crab and cream cheese concoction that enveloped those dainty little mushroom caps. Yes, I used my bread to get every last bit. My friend was teasing me everything tasted good thanks to the appletini I'd consumed (which was perfect).. but no this is so not true. Our server was terrific and highly attentive without being too invasive. We both had steaks and lobster and crab legs - everything was fantastic. I even ordered dessert because everything had tasted so good! (I have half a slice of cheesecake sitting in my fridge for further indulgence tonight!) The creme brulee was so delicious (I stuck my fork in my friends brulee - they didn't mind).

The Keg is now on my list of places to take friends and family when they come to visit. 5 stars across the board.. loved the feel of the place too. Tshirt and jeans are ok (you won't get turned away) but I found people were wearing business casual. Even the kids in the restaurant were well-behaved haha :D 

It is a little pricey but really not much more than Outback - and we like this place more - all they need is a blooming onion and we will never go back to Outback :D"}
{"text":"Yesterday was our mother/daughter day and we decided to go to The Keg for happy hour; which we have done quite a few times before. I feel like the last few times I have gone there, I have been disappointed. However, yesterday was great! We actually sat on the patio in the couches, very comfy by the way. 
Our waitress, Andra was amazing (which is quite rare at the Keg...) she listened, she cared and she was sweet! 
My mom got the Pinot Noir and I got the Pinot Gris, $8 for 9oz is a great price! For food, we got the warm brie (which we always get!) it is so good, just melts in your mouth. And the we got the Prime Rib Sliders! It comes with a touch of horseradish, delicious!
When we go back, we will definitely ask for Andra! She made us love The Keg again!"}
{"text":"The hubby and I came here for my birthday.  If you sign up with them, they will send you a coupon for a free meal during your birthday month, so of course we went!

As soon as we walked in, we were greeted and seated.  Our server was Montana and she was great.  She was really friendly but also knew when to leave us alone and enjoy our meal.  We had a nice private table, which was perfect.  A caesar salad sounded great to start but I really didn't want to ruin my meal.  She offered to split the salad between us.  Again, perfect.  And it was one of the better caesar salads I've had.  We were also happy to see that one of our favorite wines was on the extensive wine list.

When dinner came, it looked fabulous.  I ordered the filet with cajun shrimp and garlic mashed potatoes.  The hubs went with the steak oscar.  So SO delicious! We will definitely be back and this might be our new birthday spot!"}
{"text":"Good food service was good. Service was a little slow. Desert was okay. I like eating here just the menu is not what I desire, though I do like steaks. Just a good place to eat and chill nothing really says it's a standout or extra special. Service is a hit or miss. I think fell some short this time."}
{"text":"Very good steaks, appetitzers (Tuna tower), good wait staff.  Very pricey but worth the occasional splurge."}
{"text":"The keg is a really good steak house for a nice dinner. We went to eat here on a random Friday as a just because dinner. We had the Prime Rib and their au 'jus sauce is really good. I recommend the Caesar salad as the Wedge salad looks really plain. The veggies are really good especially the mushrooms. The bread is really good and holds you over until your food comes. Staff is friendly too!"}
{"text":"Dropped in for nachos and pints. Nachos were fresh, chewy, cheesy and chock full of fresh vegetables. All were beautifully presented and portions were more than ample for the two of us. For pints we had drafts of Heineken. The first pint was a touch flat so our server graciously offered a repour which turned out to be far better. After the nachos we enjoyed hot, fresh and full bodied coffee along with a generous piece of cheesecake with a fine amount of strawberries and strawberry sauce. The cake was fresh, tasty and rich. The base was a thick coat of graham wafer. 
The service was attentive, the surroundings clean and the ambiance relaxed and refined."}
{"text":"It was definitely a HAPPY HALLOWEEN night at the Keg!!!#BEST Halloween night ever!!! The music was bumpin', the food was delicious and the service was great! Our server Josh had great recommendations like getting both the blue cheese & honey mustard dressings to go with the garden salad! It was big & flavorful! Everything was so fresh! Loved that scratch made blue cheese dressing with the chunky blue cheese chunks! The bacon wrapped Filet Mignon was so flavorful!#Off the chain! It was tender & seasoned to perfection! The yellow hollandaise sauce complimented it well!!! We loved our sides as well which were the mashed potatoes & the works potatoes. The veggies were also good. When I go back, I'm getting the same thing!!!

The Brie pesto cheese platter was off the chain just like always! The cheese, pesto & red jelly compliment the baguette slices so well! It's an explosion of flavor in your mouth with every bite! The straw lem has a sparkle to it#A little fizz, which makes it refreshingly delicious!

The key lime pie is some of the best I've tasted! It's so rich & flavorful! The red drizzle is a cute presentation and enhances the flavor of the pie! The Billy Myers pie was okay this time. It's usually a fav, but this time it needed more chocolate & caramel. It didn't taste as flavorful as usual & look, I tried that first before the I tried the key lime pie. Hahahaha. It's not like one flavor took away from the other. I didn't have to cleanse my palate because I tried the Billy Myers pie first and it was still bland. Glad I had my back-up key lime pie! As long as I can take some food & dessert home I can order A LOT!!! Hahaha. I had a little bite of steak left over for the next day & it was soooo flavorful even the next day! So you know the Keg be throwin' down!!! I also had some key lime pie left over, which was also good the next day. We will definitely be back! Josh & the staff were AWESOME!!! :)"}
{"text":"This was a pretty good steakhouse in my opinion. I got the NY Strip with a twice baked potato. I also had scallops wrapped in bacon for an appetizer. 

The scallops and bacon were really good. They went well with a kilt lifter. They were cooked to perfection and had great flavor.

The steak was ordered medium rare however it came out more medium than anything. It was flavored well but i am sure i would have enjoyed it more if it was cooked properly. 

The twice baked potato was actually one of the best i have ever had. It was very delicious and i highly recommend it. 

Overall i will go back for dinner at some point I am sure. The price was in line with other steak houses and the food was good."}
{"text":"Excellent! 

Our first visit last evening was superb. The \"2\" Erin's that waited on us were fun and informative. My wife and I ordered sirloin steaks and they were cooked to perfection. Mashed garlic potatoes were included along with a few green beans for color. I enjoyed a wedge of iceberg lettuce with blue cheese dressing and bacon bits to start my meal. It was very good. 

Erin recommended a bottle of white wine we've never tried. It was an un-Oaked Chardonnay in a ceramic bottle. It paired really well with the steaks. 

The service was very well attended and we both really enjoyed the meal and atmosphere of this Keg."}
{"text":"I've been going to this restaurant for a number of years. I must say they have the best Prime Rib Burger I've tasted since I moved to Arizona. The service is always good. No matter what I order it's delightful. I recommend this for anybody looking for a great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Came here Friday night for a drink with a co-worker. Was super impressed by the quality of the food and drink and most of all, the service! Since moving to Phoenix I have had sub-par service at almost every restaurant I have visited. To the point where I haven't bothered going out much because it just doesn't seem worth it. The Keg completely changed things around for me. Hands down best service I've gotten since moving to Phoenix. My co-worker and I did not spend a lot of money on this outing and we were still treated like royalty. Waitress was so friendly and welcoming. Checked in on us many times and never let our water glasses get more than half empty. Must have had my glass filled 5 times. The food and drink came at the right time. First we ordered mojitos for $6 off the happy hour menu and then we ordered nachos. So in total we probably spent about $20 but you would never know that by the way we were treated. We never felt rushed or pressured to spend money. So you know what, the next time I do feel like spending money and having a real nice dinner I will absolutely go here. I know they treat their customers well no matter what. The ambiance here is lovely for a date night or night out. The patio is great- love dining outdoors! Drinks were generously sized, quite strong, and of course delicious. Can't wait to return. Finally some good service in Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"Normally I'm not a big chain restaurant frequenter but I like that the Keg Steakhouse sends me an email where I can get $25 off a birthday dinner. Thus, the husband and I went recently for my birthday and it was delicious. I ordered the Filet Oscar, which is a tenderloin wrapped in bacon and topped with shrimp, scallops and asparagus with béarnaise sauce. Delicious! The steak was medium-rare, which made a tender meal. I normally really like béarnaise sauce but this sauce was overpowering - wish I ordered it on the side. The shrimp and scallops were fantastic though. The husband ordered one of their specials, I can't remember which, but it was steak and it was cooked just right. Both of us got the twice baked potato which is really fluffy with bacon bits. For desert we ordered the Billy Miner Pie. Husband loved the pie. 

Our waitress was super perky and friendly. She was able to offer different items on the menu and segway into holiday meals without seeming harsh or pushy. Great service!

Overall, it's a good time that we enjoy once or twice a year."}
{"text":"Great service,  good food, a little overpriced. This is a good place for family and friends to enjoy a good meal. I enjoyed the crab cakes and a sirloin. The crab cakes were very good with great flavor and lots of crab. The top sirloin was seasoned well and cooked perfectly. The steak was served with asparagus and some roasted red pepper. Both were cooked well. Overall it was a great meal and the staff was attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Excellent meal tonight at the The Keg on Dixon. Was served by Anjelica in the bar area and from start to finish an extremely enjoyable experience. Lively atmosphere with a busy business crowd at 7, parking lot was full! 

Steak was cooked perfectly. Finished off with the Billy Miner pie which our server recommended and told us the story, truly an excellent night out. Would strongly recommend. The bar manager came by and checked up on us as well, seemed extremely genuine and really appreciated her coming over ."}
{"text":"Omg don't be fooled by the good reviews. Service was terrible, 2 TBone steaks were cold. Manager was kind enough to bring us fresh ones... and charged us for it! Drinks took forever. All around terrible..."}
{"text":"I've eaten here before and had the steak which is really good. This visit, I had the prime rib since I was trying for something different and the server said it was what they were known for. The prime rib was really good and so was the grilled veggies and baked potato it came with. The food here is pretty good and consistent but I gave it 3 stars because, well, it's a steakhouse and there isn't anything here you can't get at other similar steakhouses. Would I dine here again? Yes, but I like to try new things so it wouldn't necessarily be a first choice."}
{"text":"Honestly, I'm sure the food is great, but never made it there. For a place to call themselves \"The Keg\" and then have only 6 crappy macro taps is an insult to beer places. Get some real beer or rename your restaurant."}
{"text":"It's a chain, but a pretty good one...

I've eaten at this Keg a few times, but there was a Keg back home north of Seattle that we'd go for special occasion family dinners sometimes, so The Keg has always held a special place in my heart. 

You'll get a very good meal here. Not to the level of a Fleming's or Morton's, and not even close to a City Hall experience, but you also don't pay anything close to what you pay at those places, which is nice. Two people can have a nice dinner and a glass of wine each and get out for $75 + tax and tip. I typically get the filet meal with a Caesar salad and twice baked potato. They also have good ribs, and my wife had the prime rib once and seemed to like it. 

The \"Keg Dinners\" are the way to go, since they're all under $30 and come with a steak, a side and a salad. None of the a la carte stuff that kills you at other steakhouses.

Service is always attentive, even if you sit in the bar area, which makes that a nice option when it's a 45 minute wait. The drinks are good, and their desserts are tasty and well priced. We've had the creme brulee a few times, and it's quite good.

It's really close to where we live, so we're here occasionally. There are better steakhouses out there, but The Keg is a really good one for the money."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for our anniversary. The food was good as always. The service was good until checkout. ... Then they charged another tables bill and our bill to our card. So now my car payment is late because the money won't get put back into Monday. Credit where credit is due they did not argue with giving it the money back. Buy they didn't seem to care about the inconvenience of it all. It seemed like they didn't really care at all to be honest like it happens often or something.  I dunno if I'll go back or not."}
{"text":"The service is always very good, but the food is always mediocre at best and it is WAY OVERPRICED. We had to send 2 of our steaks back because they weren't cooked properly, and the quality of the meat was fairly poor, my steak had a lot of fat pieces on the edges and the rest was chewey. 
Sadly I get better steaks at Outback Steakhouse, and they are a lot cheaper!"}
{"text":"Awesome food!!!!! One of my favorite restaurants ever. The steaks are always delicious and cooked to order. Everyone is great and very nice. Recommends all the time."}
{"text":"I feel horrible that I haven't updated my review for the keg! After my last dining experience I thought for sure there was no way I would ever go back the keg! But I received an e-mail via yelp from the owner of the establishment apologizing for the service that we had received and said to let her know next time we went back in.

So we went back a few weeks ago and our second time was leaps and bounds better than our first. They had the prime rib (which was seriously fabulous and cooked to perfection!), our server was amazing and on top of things and I had my kiwi cocktail! The stars aligned that night and we had a perfect evening! I can not wait to go back to The Keg to eat their delicious food, experience their fabulous service and the beautiful ambiance. 

Kudos also to the general manager who was genuinely concerned with my experience the first time at the Keg - He was really interested in hearing my concerns and wanted to know what they could do better in the future to making dining there a much more positive experience. For that reason alone it shows the pride they take in the restaurant and are concerned about YOUR experience and I will be back.... and bragging to everyone about this place."}
{"text":"The wait service was great we got there early around 5 and they tried to sit us in a small table. When we asked to be hostess seemed a little annoyed. They changed the Caesar salad to a smaller portion less chicken and they don't cut the chicken. They charged 11 dollars for an extra piece. The wedge was great and the blue cheese waa more like sour cream.  The stuffed mushrooms are a must!"}
{"text":"Awesome service and food.  Our server, Michael, was the best.  I gave him a \"knuckle shot\" at the end of the meal and he said in his 3 years there that was the first one...well deserved my friend.  I had a perfect cut of prime rib (the Keg Classic) and my wife had the filet (the Keg Classic).  Both were cooked to perfection.  This place is A++.  It was our anniversary and the manager brought us a slice of the mocha ice cream cake for dessert and personally thanked us for choosing the Keg for our special day....I think next July 30th, we will be back.  Thank you KEG."}
{"text":"Have been to The Keg all over the country and was in Toronto for the and stopped in for dinner and a few drinks. Sat at the bar and order the rib steak, it came out perfect, no complaints here. Bartender Patrick was unreal at his job and should probably get a promotion. 

As always The Keg is consistently a great place to go for dinner no matter what location in Canada."}
{"text":"We came to the Keg for our daughters 5th Birthday. She wanted to have some ribs. The front desk gals were very friendly, and very sweet to our daughter. Our waiter was Trevor, he was extremely professional, service oriented. and made sure we were well taken care of. The dinner was good. We had the ribs, my wife had steak and lobster. The portions seemed generous, and everything was fresh hot. 
For our daughters birthday the manager brought her a mocha ice cream cake which she loved. This place was perfect for our night. Everyone was very friendly, and the service was VERY good!"}
{"text":"Very poor service last night. Wedge salad was a head of iceberg cut into quarters with very little else on it. Blue cheese dressing had no flavor. French onion soup was the worst I've ever had."}
{"text":"After reading other reviews we went to try it.  Couldn't have been any better food or service!  We are definitely planning on coming back!"}
{"text":"My husband, Neal, and I always celebrate our birthdays at The Keg in Chandler every year. We always enjoy the excellent food and wonderful service. Tonight Jacob was our server and was very thorough, efficient and knowledgeable. Much to my dismay, they were out of key lime pie, but we had their delicious creme brûlée instead. Neal and I had a very enjoyable experience at The Keg as always and look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"I went for my birthday last night. We called ahead for reservations and the hubs told them about the birthday. We showed up to a card signed by everyone, a lot of happy birthdays, no singing (thank God!), and a comped dessert (and not a scoop of ice cream, but something off the menu). I felt very taken care of. I got the whole lobster. Yummy! The keg is a nice moderately priced steakhouse that knows how to do service like a big fancy steakhouse. I'll be doing more birthdays there!!"}
{"text":"I grew up on a farm where we raised our own beef and am therefore fussy when it comes to how meat is cooked and tastes.  I like the Keg and have always had a good cut of meat when I have gone here.  

I have only eaten the steaks, salad, potato, and veggies,  but my wife has had some of the other items on the menu, which she says have been good, with the exception of the risotto.  The birthday coupon is the best (FREE STEAK AND LOBSTER), and it is sent to your home by mail.  I do not know of another steak house that does this.

Price is alright for being a steak house and for the location.  I like the atmosphere, the low lights, and the sense of being private even though there are others seated all around.  

This place is very busy on the weekends with waits of up to 2hrs. Try to plan ahead because there is no call ahead seating or reservations."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this trip to the Keg in Gilbert didn't go as well as trips in the past.  We arrived and sat on patio by fireplace to have a glass of wine before going in to dinner.  It took forever to even be acknowledged and then another forever to get our drinks... OK it was Friday evening and they were busy, but really??? At least acknowledge that we are there and you see us...  (Drinks were good at least) Finally we went in to our table, by the fireplace which I had requested, but when I asked the server to turn fireplace on he said \"sure\" but never did....  All of the ordering, serving, refills on water, etc took FOREVER and we had to ask for it every time... where is the service here?  The server at the next table over was right on the ball and actually brought us ice and butter even though we were not his table. I think our server might have been new, so I'll cut him some slack, but really????  Water refills???  Taking orders???  Flipping a switch for fireplace??  When dinner arrived 3 out of the 4 were good... but my prime rib was 50% fat... I should have sent it back, but I was aggravated by then...  I LOVE to go to the Keg for my birthday dinner, but not so sure I'll be back next time (Also, I never received my $25 birthday coupon in my email which made me unhappy too). To spend the amount of money we did on dinner for 4, it should have been a better experience...."}
{"text":"We came here for a birthday dinner and was pleased beyond words.  Great service and fantastic food.  Steak was flavorful, vegetables were perfect and the twice-baked potato was amazing.  The carrot cake was huge and delicious, definitely big enough to share and still have a little leftover. I would absolutely come back."}
{"text":"Amazing service and even better food, very accommodating for gluten free! We went for our  anniversary and made it extra special with complimentary champagne. Kellen was our server, paced out our meal perfectly!"}
{"text":"One of the better filets I have ever had.  Still full 10 hours later.  They also pour the martini at the table and fill the glass which is definitely rare.  High end joint but reasonable for what it is."}
{"text":"I was talking to a friend about how much I loved Ruth Chris Steakhouse and he suggested I try this place.  My wife and I finished up watching a movie and a steak just sounded good so I wanted to give the place a try.  

After finding out it was my first time the manager came and offered me a free appetizer which was way cool of them ... to bad I am not a huge fan of Shrimp cocktails, but the gesture was amazing.

I ordered the 10oz filet which really was melt in your mouth goodness.  Its about 10 bucks cheaper then the filet at Ruth Chris but I have to admit I still like the steak at Ruth Chris better.  BUT DONT GET ME WRONG this was an amazing steak, its just hard to beat Ruth!!!

I also had the sweet potato fries which were amazing served with some kind of sauce that I still am not sure what it was, but it was amazing!!!  

My wife had the sirloin and said it was really good too, and we both agree we will be going back to this place.  The service was tremendous and friendly and we got right in and the food service was quick.  

A very good place for an amazing date night!!"}
{"text":"My mom and I visited while there was a 45 minute wait. Luckily the amazing hostess showed us a hidden table at the bar for us to be seated at right away. Our server was amazing, we let her know we were in a hurry and everything came out very fast. You can't beat $32 for a filet and side! The bread was also delicious!"}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE  The Keg...my boyfriend and I come here as often as we can to enjoy amazing food, awesome service and a great patio.  You can never go wrong with the Orange Martini..everything we have ever eaten has been fantastic - from the salads to the steaks.  The boyfriends favorite - the baseball cut steak.  I am a lobster fan myself, but anything you get well certainly be great.

The service is also outstanding.  We were here a few weeks ago to celebrate his birthday and our anniversary and the manager brought out champagne and a free desert. It was a very nice touch that made our night special. They have certainly earned our repeat business!

Oh, the weeknight happy hour specials are also great!!"}
{"text":"Another great meal here last night. We both had filet mignon and lobster tail the server was attentive without being bothersome. The atmosphere was great (some people dressed up, some business casual, some in shorts). The food was delicious - definitely my favorite place  (for the price and quality and ambiance)  to go for a good steak dinner."}
{"text":"If you like steak and a nice relaxing atmosphere, this is a great place. I always enjoy the Prime Rib. Always great. I have been to 4 locations. 3 in British Columbia and this one in Phoenix, AZ. Never have been disappointed."}
{"text":"I DIDN'T GET CARDED HERE!  For most of you that wouldn't be a big deal but when you look like you're 16 like me, it's a pretty big thing when you don't have to pull out your wallet and grab your ID to order a martini.  All jokes aside though I had an awesome experience at the Keg.  Service was exceptional from start to finish, I'm so mad I don't remember the waiter's name but he was awesome, totally attentive and made sure everything was just the way we wanted.  Since we had never been before he explained the menu to us and gave us his recommendations.  I ordered the Prime Rib Classic with garlic mashed potatos and my date got the New York Strip with the twice baked potato.

The Prime Rib was sooooo good!  It was cooked perfectly, very tender and had a great flavor!  I'm so glad I took the waiter's advice and went with that.  The garlic mashed potatos great too.  My date's steak was had a really nice flavor as well but I didn't try his potato.  For dessert we shared the Creme Brulee which was also spectacular.  The crust had a wonderful texture and flavor and the custard was the perfect compliment to it.  I can't wait to go back but next time I think I'll plan for it by not eating the whole day before so that I can actually finish my plate!"}
{"text":"Have been here twice. Everything is excellent as far as food quality.  It's pretty busy on most evenings and that can slow things down so if you think you might be in a hurry I would recommend something else. Service has been outstanding each time that I have been.  The food is good and they have a reasonably diverse wine lists with mostly national wine offerings. The prime rib is superb. Most meals will cost in the range of 15-30 dollars depending on pairings and w/o drinks. Definitely worth it for a nice night out."}
{"text":"Omgee! Where have you been all my life!?! 
Stopped at Target to grab a few things and decided to stop in here since I was hungry. It's Thursday so the Thursday special was a strawberry mile! Delish! Muddled strawberries, purée , and a hint of ginger. I couldn't get enough! Now to the food....  ordered the mushrooms Neptune and backed garlic shrimp. 6 pockets of each packed in delicious goodness and cheese. Gosh I burned my mouth eating them because I couldn't wait for it to cool off!!! Definitely a must order!! I'll be back and back again!!!"}
{"text":"Dylan K you are awesome great customer service.. Great food, tasteful and FRESH. Will be back...........happy customer"}
{"text":"As for service, it was very good so they get an extra star for that. As for the food, it isn't as great as I remember it in Calgary on 36 Street. My hubby ordered prime rib. It was done very well. I ordered a bunch of appies and they were just okay. The escargot wasn't really as good as I remembered it to be in Calgary. Also the French onion soup was good the first few bites but got kinda too cheesy. The Caesar salad wasn't very tasty either. The chocolate cake was moist but wasn't anything to call home about. Food gets 3/5. Service 4/5."}
{"text":"I really did like this place.  The food is very good.  I really liked the French onion soup & their burgers are great, as is the steak.  The prices are a good value and I will be going back."}
{"text":"I love eating at the Keg and prefer the San Tan location. The server that we had at the Chandler location was really rude to us and didn't handle a money discrepancy issue properly. Great food."}
{"text":"One of my family's favorite restaurants! We love eating here all the time. We are going to go again this weekend. The staff is always super kind, efficient on bringing food out on time, courteous and the food itself is divine. 100% recommended! I don't, however, recommend the Chandler location. We visited there once and our server was super rude. The San Tan location though, two thumbs way way up!"}
{"text":"We celebrated our 43rd Anniversary at The Keg yesterday. The service and the food were amazing. We had some special requests on food preparation and it was done perfectly. Thanks to the Keg for making our evening special."}
{"text":"Such a great steakhouse. Beautiful ambiance. The blue cheese crusted filet is my favorite. The wine list is great. Everyone is nice. But I guess when your spending $100 for one meal they should be right?!?"}
{"text":"WOW talk about customer service! Came here for my engagement, was such an awesome experience and an amazing meal. Danny Sanchez the gm came over and was more the gracious, he went above and beyond into making our very special night truly amazing. Couldn't thank him enough. Our server Matt was also really genuine and nice, will definitely be coming back here more and would recommend The Keg to anyone!"}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant that is classy and has great food! Went in for happy hour, $4 beers and $6 glasses of wine.... they also have a variety of appetizers to choose from. 

They got a new steak and Cajun shrimp combo plate that was really good. My fiancé got the bacon wrapped chicken, so we got to try a wide variety of food! Everything was tasty and the service was great."}
{"text":"I have been driving by this place forever, and finally decided to give it a shot. We were greeted by a lovely young lady and seated immediately. Our waiter was at our table within seconds and was very friendly and outgoing, offering suggestions and he always had a smile on his face. We had the cheesy garlic bread as an appetizer, and it was hard not to inhale it..it was that good. The husband had prime rib and a twice baked potato and I had the steak Oscar and mashed potatoes. Pretty sure they were the best mashed potatoes that I have ever had and the meat was cooked perfectly. Prime rib melted in your mouth and the steak was tender and well seasoned. We had the creme brulee for dessert, it was amazing and one was enough for us to share. I am sad that I waited so long to visit The Keg, but we will definitely be back. Oh, the iced tea was amazeballs too! Love strong tea :)"}
{"text":"My wife and I come here at least twice a year. We come on our birthday months because they have an email list that will get you a free entree on your birthday. We both got the prime rib this time and it was amazing. She also got some crab and it was delicious as well. We had two different red wines that were terrific. You have to try the creamed spinach. Wow! This place has really become a tradition for us. Last year they messed up our steaks and they recooked it and gave us free dessert. It's always great when restaurants make it right. We will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Really good with outstanding service! Had the prime rib and wine. Nice variety of wine selections."}
{"text":"Request Joel if you want outstanding service. He really tried hard even when it was busy to make our experience great."}
{"text":"The food is always good but the thing that frustrates us every time is the loudness of the music. We find ourselves yelling over it to talk. It is tiring."}
{"text":"I had came here for my daughters birthday, there was about 10 of us and the dinner started out by the waitress on the patio telling us to push our own tables together, it seemed as if she was annoyed that we were there, I'm sorry maybe next time I spend $400 on a meal I'll make sure I take my business elsewhere, I was trying to make her night special but not so special. No thank you keg"}
{"text":"The service is ok. Don't expect the best seat if you don't dress up but that's typical of most higher end restaurants. If you like rare-cooked steak, go with the baseball top sirloin, real good. Just sucks the only low-carb side option they have is asparagus; I would have preferred salad but still ok. Don't waste money on the peppercorn sauce, it tasted \"frozen\". Overall I enjoyed the experience at this location. I was here two nights in a row. The patio is nice as long as you don't mind the sound of plane taking off since they are located right by the airport. Could not hear the planes from inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"I also had my birthday dinner there and also had Greg as our server. He did a great job and was continuously checking on us. He even replaced our caesar salad with a brand new, fresh one after seeing us try to pick out the cheese. Everything was fresh out of the kitchen, the shrimp cocktail was juicy and cool, the bread hot from the oven, and the steak cooked perfectly. 
Overall, everything was extremely good and I'd come back here again. And probably request Greg as a waiter :)"}
{"text":"A nice cold Arizona evening we ventured for some meat and potatoes Keg style.  Greeted by very nice staff and very nice waiter, service was prompt.  Started with some salad, casear; it was okay, almost frozen from being on the cart in the walk-in, kind of took away from the salad being so cold.  I had the Prime Rib and wifey had Bacon wrapped Filet.  Prime Rib was (see above) A-OK, nothing AWESOME but nothing horrible.  The jus was good but the prime rib was just A-OK. Filet wasn't very filet tender, more of like a ribeye without the fat, which I love Filets but this just didn't hit the mark.  Wine selections and price were very nice and not too expensive and probably worth it for the cost but nothing blew me away."}
{"text":"My friend and I came in one Monday evening, to celebrate with wine and desserts.

We ordered baked brie (cheese is always a good idea! Except they could've added more toast), Billy Miner pie (it's a nice generous serving and delicious), creme brulee (creamy) with a bottle of champagne and a bottle of merlot. 

The waitstaff was friendly and attentive. He gave us the space to talk, but was nearby if we needed help with pouring our drinks. 

This place is intimate, but comfortable."}
{"text":"Ok I know it's a chain and the beauty of Yelp is finding places you wouldn't normally find.  But if you're in the Desert Ridge area anyway the bar part of the Keg is always a safe bet.  Really busy and everyone seems to be having a good time.  Good food and happy hour prices.
I've sat in the regular restaurant part and frankly didn't like that.  The bar area is where it's at here."}
{"text":"Many people have recommended that I try eating at The Keg, but the thought of yet another upscale chain steakhouse was kind of a turnoff.  The food is usually great at places like this, but the lack of uniqueness is a bit a of put off.  While I won't say that The Keg offers anything more spectacular than rest, the service was awesome.

A big group of us celebrated our friends' engagement at The Keg.  Two servers handled 16 people in spectacular fashion.  Drinks were flowing, food was always on the table, no orders were screwed up (quite rear with a group this size), and they even separated the checks by couple without a fuss, and the Keg did not automatically add a gratuity to the check (while I understand the practice, I prefer a server actually work for their tip).

Most importantly, my steak was good, and not overpriced."}
{"text":"My son and I visited on Thanksgiving.  We didn't have family in town and I was recovering from surgery and didn't feel like cooking.  We were able to make a reservation the evening before.  The hostesses were very polite and our waiter, Alex, was wonderful.  He knew the history of the restaurant and the menu.  He was very polite and was able to make suggestions.  I enjoyed the prime rib and twice baked potatoes and was able to bring some home for seconds.  My son enjoyed his burger.  We shared creme brûlée and both had cocktails.  My son just turned 21 and isn't used to drinking.  They took his drink back and watered it down and didn't charge us.  I'd love to try it again for a special occasion.  It's lovely inside and feels romantic and homey."}
{"text":"Fantastic steakhouse. It has everything Flemings has with the same quality but within a five minute drive of my doorstep and at least 15-20% less expensive. We usually eat here on holidays (Christmas Eve, Easter and birthdays) when visitors come to town and the occasional happy hour which puts us there 12-15 times a year."}
{"text":"I've been two separate times recently and both times are orders are no where close to correct.  Most recent visit- Steak was not cooked anywhere close (not to mention they disregard the \"hold the bacon\" every time on the order) to my liking after cutting into it, so they took it back and proceeded to cook it more.  Only problem, was they used the same steak which was cut into and then dried out.  The side of roasted potatoes magicially changed into mushrooms, but since the rest of my party was done eating, I just ate the dried out steak.  

Sure, the manager bought us an appetizer and covered my steak, but I go there for great food, not free food."}
{"text":"Here on business with the hubs and came here to eat steak. He ordered the ribeye charred Chicago style and medium-rare. It came out perfectly cooked and tasty. The veggies were limp and looked like it came out of the frozen section though.

I ordered the sea bass over quinoa salad and salsa and it was one of the best sea bass I ever had. It must have been poached in butter. It was tender, flaky with a bit of crust and so amazing with the tangy salsa.

If you're in AZ, there are 2 locations. We ate at the Tempe location. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to the Keg since moving from LA.  Everyone raved about the food, so we had to try it.  It was one of the worst dining experiences we have had in the last year. I am certain I would NEVER try their food again. The service, staff and ambience were all above average but the food was AWEFUL.  Everything was extremely salty. We had to send back both the escargot stuffed mushrooms and the calimari as they were both too salty for my wife and I to eat.  The main course was no different. I ordered the NY steak and, that's right, it was WAY too salty to eat. They then brought me a plate with a completely unseasoned steak, unseasoned steamed vegetables and a plain baked potato.  This was not at all to my liking. I don't think I would ever want to try this place again!"}
{"text":"There is nothing overly spectacular about this place but it was a solid visit. Good steak, good drinks and only somewhat pricey. I have no real reason to complain but also no real reason to gloat."}
{"text":"Been a long time since I've been here. Friendly and fun, good service, great food. Could do with some more interesting choices of sides and desserts but the entrees are spot on! Highly recommended for a nice date out."}
{"text":"Food is amazing. Wedge salad is phenomenal. Steak cooked to perfection. Excellent taste. Melt in your mouth tender. 
Server was awesome. Very attentive and always available to fill drinks and checking in to see if you need anything."}
{"text":"The Keg
23 S. McClintock Drive
Tempe, AZ  85281

It was birthday time, and we decided to try The Keg for our dinner. The Keg has a birthday club which I highly recommend, as one dinner is free for the night. In honesty, it is only the main course that is free, with all side dishes and entrees additional cost.

We started off with cocktails - I ordered a chocolate martini and companion ordered a brandy alexander. Both cocktails were full measure and properly made. The barkeep definitely knows how to make a good cocktail and not skimp.

Next came appetizers. I ordered escargot with mushroom caps and companion ordered calamari with ginger sauce and feta sauce. Both appetizers were excellent and I could not resist dipping a piece of the fresh warm bread into the sauce. I'm not sure they would have to wash the plate after that!

Next was the main course. Companion ordered the 14 oz prime rib and pronounced it the best ever. It was served with asparagus and a side of mushrooms. The meat was so tender that companion could have eaten it with a spoon.

My main course was the 20 oz bone in rib steak, which is supposed to be the king of steaks. It was well seasoned. Unfortunately, mine was the joker of steaks. Filled with streaks of sinew that were virtually impossible to cut through or chew. I ordered a side of bearnaise sauce which came in a little metal pitcher that could hold about 2 oz and which was filled with about 1 oz of a very poor, tasteless bearnaise sauce totally devoid of any tarragon taste or champagne vinegar. My side dish was pencil asparagus that were properly cooked though no hollandaise sauce was offered with it, and a pile of limp, flaccid green beans that I'm sure saw a better life the day before.

As befitting a restaurant with a bill over $100, the place was spotless as was the bathroom. Service was paced and not rushed.

This is a mixed review in that one meal was outstanding and the other was poor to be generous. I have eaten USDA good steaks that were more tender than what was served to me. If I were the inspector for USDA I'd grade the steak as utility grade it was so poor. The manager came over and inquired about my steak, which I was busily trying to saw through. When I told him how poor it was he said he would come back and check on it, but he never came back and I have taken the remains home in the hope that a truly sharp knife will allow me to cut it up and feed it to my dogs. This is not meant to be an exaggeration nor a put down of the restaurant, but a plea that they either change their purveyor or inspect their meat more thoroughly. It was a very disappointing birthday.

3 stars for cleanliness, service, and some parts of the meal."}
{"text":"Took a friend to dinner here this past Tuesday.  It was his first visit at any Keg; I've only dined at the Chandler location.  I enjoyed our dinner and conversation, even though we elected to stay at the bar when we could've had our pick of tables and booths.

I had received an invite to enjoy dinner for two for $30 (choice of prime rib and sirloin, plus potato and veggies), but when we learned that we could opt to apply the savings (a $15.90 value) towards other selections, we decided to go w/ the server's suggestions of filet mignon w/ blue cheese mousse ($24.95; for me) and sirloin topped w/ roasted red pepper cream sauce and garnished w/ grilled asparagus, lobster, and scallops ($26.95; for him), both cooked to medium.  We were promptly served The Keg's awesome complimentary table bread and butter.  Love it!

After about a 20-minute wait, our entrees arrived, and boy, were they beautiful!  I wished I had taken photos!  (I promise to next time.)  While I loved my garlic-studded blue cheese mousse-topped bacon-wrapped filet mignon (Whew!  Try saying that fast three times!), w/ sweet potato fries instead of the standard loaded double-baked potato, it was my friend's roasted red pepper cream sauced sirloin that stole the show!  Apparently my friend enjoyed his meal, since the only things that remained on his plate were the potato skin and a couple pieces of soggy sweet potato fries (the kitchen made a mistake and switched our potato selections).  I will definitely order this dish again, and it'll have to be soon as the entree isn't even on the regular dining menu- it's a seasonal offering.  

I really wanted to have a glass of wine, but decided against it as I had a long drive home to look forward to; However, it was a pleasant surprise to find out that The Keg offered Blue Moon on tap, and it was w/ pleasure to savor the few sips off of my friend's pilsner glass.

The Keg now offers happy hours, but only on drinks- no food specials :("}
{"text":"What can you say about The Keg?! It's always a solid tasty meal & our server was delightful & efficient. The can't miss steak is almost always done right & the twice baked potato is always delicious. 

You almost can't miss with The Keg."}
{"text":"I mean what can you say about The Keg!? Always good or great. Always consistent. Always very tasty! I had my usual fare...10oz Fillet with twice baked potato & veggies. Mixed green salad to start. I don't honk I've been to a Keg that has disappointed. Airport Toronto Keg delivers! Nufsaid!"}
{"text":"We ordered a New York strip, My wife and I were happy with the temp of the meat.  Well done.  I like A1 steak sauce when I have a baked potato and Steak.  Right when the meal was delivered from the Kitchen, I was asked anything else from the kitchen, yes steak sauce please, we have Heinz and A1, A1 please.  10 minutes....  I asked the waiter..... 10 minutes later I asked the bus boy.  30 minutes I gave up.  Food was good, service failed X3!

Its not cheap to come to this place.......   Would like better experience!"}
{"text":"super bummed they got rid of the prime rib sliders. it was the best app on the menu. this was the main reason to come. won't see me here much any more!! get them back please."}
{"text":"I love the Keg!! What sounds like a trashy bar and grill run by washed up College dropouts is actually a classy restaurant with a delicious menu of steaks and seafood.  The patio outside is amazing, like a 5 star resort.  Inside is dark and romantic.  There is a large bar area with tables, lounge chairs, and a fireplace.  The service is very friendly and attentive.  They have a nice selection of draft beers, wine, and drinks.  The food is simply outstanding.  I've had filet mignon and a couple of the sirloins. The steak was cooked perfectly, full of flavor.  The sides are pretty simple, but tasty nonetheless.  Prices are high, but you get what you pay for here.  The Keg is quickly becoming my go to when I'm in Chandler."}
{"text":"I have been to The Keg several times but it's been well over a year since my last visit. My wife ended up getting a $25 off coupon for her Bday so we decided to try it out again and I'm glad that we did. This location in Desert Ridge is very nice and well maintained. We started with calamari which was excellent and I had ordered the bacon wrapped filet prepared medium and the wife had the blue cheese filet also prepared medium. Both game out prepared well. I liked that my filet was charred on the outside but tender in the middle. In my opinion the blue cheese filet was more tasty. I liked how the blue cheese accompanied the steak. I would order that one next time. After the warm bread to start and the filling steaks we had to pass on desert which was a shame:-(. Overall The Keg is a solid 4-4.5 rating restaurant. 

My only complaint was that we each ordered a vanilla porter tap beer for dinner, expecting it to just be a pint. I didn't specify on size but when we got our beers they were the large 22oz. I didn't complain but after 3/4 of a way through the beer I started to get tired of the sweet vanilla flavor. Would have preferred a 16oz pint way more than a large. Would have been nice to have the choice too. That is about my only complaint."}
{"text":"Incredible food and service! Both steaks were cooked to perfection! Can't wait to come back for more!"}
{"text":"The food here is excellent, but what really stood out to me was the service.  We had a large group, but the waiter was on top of everything, and there were always more waiters to help out with food delivery.  Also, we were here celebrating a graduation, and they brought out two complimentary desserts! Which were these mocha pie things, and were insanely delicious.  The tuna tartare and calamari were also outstanding.  I would say that my steak was a little overseasoned, and I heard that from a few people I dined with, but that was the only negative of the evening."}
{"text":"I have been here many times with my husband and never thought to review it until now. 

My faves on the menu include the spinach salad with mandarin oranges, dried cranberries, pecans and goat cheese. The French Onion Soup and Chicken Tortilla Soup as well as their burgers and the Ahi Tuna Sliders ...though I did not see the Tuna sliders on the menu last time : ( 

Our last visit a few days ago was a very nice one....we sat out on the patio and soaked up some wonderful sun! Our waiter was awesome, friendly, fast and knowledgeable. My husband loved his steak and 2 Seabreeze Cocktails (vodka, cranberry and grapefruit) and I had a very delicious burger, chicken soup and freshly squeezed Orange Juice.

This place is definitely the better option in this shopping area if you want to avoid all the grease traps."}
{"text":"Went here a few days after Valentine's day with the wife. Nice looking place inside and out, even has a fireplace. The service was SLOW! You see your waiter for a second and then they disappear behind the glass by the kitchen. Never got a refill on tea. Steak was good but overpriced for what you are getting. None of the food seemed very hot, even the steak. Had coffee and it was barely above room temperature. Had the Billy Miner pie for dessert that everyone raves about, it was ok but it had been assembled on the plate either earlier that day or the day before and put in the freezer uncovered, tasted a little freezer burnt. Glad I tried it but we won't be back."}
{"text":"Love the food. The service is great. But just wanted to ask, what restaurant doesn't have a balsamic vinaigrette? Or just straight Italian? Had to order the Caesar salad since the dressing selection is very limited! That is my only issue here...."}
{"text":"I haven't been to The Keg in awhile but decided to try the newest location for date night since it was right in my neighbourhood. Brand new building, two floors, easy to find.

The building itself was quite modern and cozy (a bit dim, but enough lighting that I could still see my food and my charming date. I have a thing against dim lighting in restaurants, but hey, that's just my own preference), and the staff were friendly and attentive. The menu has something for everyone, even has cauliflower steak!

The food was quite good and tasty. We started off with the calamari, a glass of Jacob's Creek Shiraz and Heineken. I had the special which was a rack of lamb on a bed of mashed vegetables. My date had the peppercorn steak with fries and roasted peppers and green beans. I must say that our dishes did revive my faith in The Keg, and I would come back. The only downside was that my lamb was more on the rare side than medium-rare (I ordered medium-rare), and the steak was more medium-rare than rare (ordered rare), but other than that, the meal was delicious.

Thanks once again to Joyce C, our wonderful server who was quite patient and full of energy (we got there around 9:15pm). Definitely helped make our night. Until next time!"}
{"text":"Have been here many times over the years and always a great experience.  Excellent streaks at reasonable prices (hello overpriced Mastros, Dominicks, Ocean Club, et al). Service is typically friendly and knowledgeable. Cozy ambiance with fireplace.  One Note:  our recent  dining experience had us seated directly across from a group of about 12 twenty-(thirty?)-somethings who were literally screeching at the top of their lungs!  We could not even hear our guests speaking to us, about 18\" away, across the table.  Restaurants Take Note: if you have an obnoxiously loud group, please ask them to tone it down, or seat them in a private room.  Perhaps even our waiters were rattled by this disruption....our orders came out incorrectly cooked, which has never happened to us before at The Keg.
Sigh....."}
{"text":"Best filet I have had in quite a while.  Caeser salad was just ok.  Twice stuffed potato was ok.  Billy pie was excellent."}
{"text":"Normally I would visit what appears to be a chessy chain eatery near a mall. But as I was looking for a nice place for Thanksgiving Dinner, this one just happened to pop up.
I perused the menu and I was honestly surprised. Prices are a little steep but it is so good. 
Our Thanksgiving Dinner was by far the best I've ever had outside of a home kitchen and easily the best Dressing I've ever had. And I don't like dressing as a whole. Theirs was outstanding. We also snaked on the Calamari. Absolutely Wonderful. I will be back here for a steak very soon. And desert. Our Cheese Cake was so smooth. Better without the Pumpkin Drizzle."}
{"text":"The Keg is usually a great place to go for dinner, but unless you want a loud atmosphere where you can barely hear each other....don't sit in the bar. We didn't have much of a choice as we hadn't made reservations and didn't want to wait 30 minutes to be seated. The food was good as it usually is and our server was attentive even though she was quite busy. Would recommend this place."}
{"text":"My family and I visited this location for the first time a couple weeks ago. The waitress was good the food was good the customer service was not as I would have expected from a steakhouse at this price point.

When my family ordered our meals everyone was happy with their food. Everything looked great. When I cut into my $38 T-bone it was over cooked, bummer but it happens. The waitress was nice about it and agreed it was clearly over done and took it back. My husband got the New York and his was cooked beautifully. The issue is that my whole family even my 6 year old finished eating before I heard anything about where my food was. I stopped the waitress and asked if they could make it to go or simply take it off the ticket as everyone else was done eating. The manager came over and apologized and I understand things happen. The brought out the meal in a bag and though this basically prevented me from eating my dinner with family  the manager did not even so much as offer a free desert or any type of \"peace offering\". I assume it is because I wasn't a jerk about it. I accepted the apology and we still tipped our waitress well but I will not be returning. Even at Olive Garden they go above and beyond if something is not right. 

Just for the record I cut into and notified the waitress rather quickly of the issue. I also did not eat any of it or whatever other weird things people do I simply just wanted my steak cooked correctly."}
{"text":"Took my staff out to dinner to celebrate and the Keg was perfect. I personally had never been, but I have always heard positive things. I think we ordered all the appetizers on the menu. My favorite was the ahi tuni. I loved it so much I ordered the ahi tuni tacos  ( they offer small plates for people like me that get full after the apps) OMG loved it!!! I'm not a steak and potato gal so this was perfect.  Everyone said their steaks and seafood was wonderful. Service and ambiance classy. I will be back very soon."}
{"text":"Was here for a business meeting and had drinks before dinner. Had a steak at the bar and it was wonderful. I would like to go back for the whole experience."}
{"text":"Went to the Keg to celebrate my husband's 50th birthday with friends. The atmosphere was laid back and casual. Our waiter was Nathan and he was awesome! The food was so delicious. The steak was perfectly cut and had a lot of flavor. The lobster was delicious. I tried the mushrooms on the appetizer menu as suggested on here and they were perfect; definitely worth trying. I also tried the desert with the Oreo crust, mocha ice cream and topped with Carmel & chocolate; OMG! So delicious. Love this place and will be back"}
{"text":"The Keg is perfect for those special occasions Birthdays/Anniversary, the romantic date night with that someone special or when you're just feeling happy.This place shall not disappoint.
You can sit at the bar or patio.I recommend the dinning space for a more romantic ambiance.

From the moment we walked in we were greeted with smiling faces and freshly baked bread(Yum).We started with some cocktails and beer i especially loved the Bourbon cherry smash(bourbon, cherry brandy liqueurs, syrup, fresh lemon juice and drunken cherries), its one of their feature cocktails and you can get a keg Size for $9.
For appetizers it was 
Baked garlic shrimp
Mushrooms Neptune(the mushrooms are stuffed with Crab and cream cheese).This Dish is Divine and must be experienced.
For Main we had the Chicken Seafood deluxe; it's a Boneless chicken breast served on garlic mashed potato and steamed asparagus.The dish is finished with scallops, shrimp and crab meat.Again it was Delicious.(The Chicken breast was in the shape of a heart)

Our Server was Great.The Food was Awesome.One of the rare restuarants where the food and the service compliment each other.I'm definitely going back again and again ...

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Twince in a roll here
First time a had a salad, really good
Second time stuffed mushrooms and appetizer and prime ribs for main corse.
Good wines, nice service
Like it really much"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for the Restaurant Week menu after having not visited in a while and left wondering why we hadn't.  The food was fantastic.  The menu is not very exciting, just your basic mid-range steak house fare with no real unique or imaginative dishes.  But it is still really excellent food.  Service was professional but not stuffy.  They also have a great list of beers on tap and wines by the glass.  I hope that we will not wait so long to return next time."}
{"text":"If you want to taste a bit of Heaven, try the Bleu Cheese Filet!  You won't be dissappointed!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised on my first visit to The Keg.  No really knowing what to expect, I came in with mid expectations.  The Food and service could not of been better.  Pistachio crusted salmon cooked perfectly, mashed potatoes and onion rings. Nice ambience and classy design.  Alexa our server was efficient, knowledgeable about the menu and great personality.   Definitely will return."}
{"text":"Lauren was an awesome server. Best whiskey sours in the state. Steak is always amazing."}
{"text":"Fantastic Service, Food and Atmosphere!  Will definitely come back :)"}
{"text":"The food was average. Tasted like it was prepared earlier in the night. I got the filet (medium rare) and it was cooked correctly. The bacon wrapped around it was undercooked. The mashed potatoes were over seasoned but tasted ok. I would have liked to have seen a better beer selection from a place called The Keg. Maybe I read into the name too much. The staff was friendly. Our waiter struggled to check on us adequately. Overall the experience was what you would expect from a chain restaurant. I will try other steakhouses before I return."}
{"text":"Have been here multiple times and kept forgetting to write a review.  Let's start out with the great ambiance they have. Warm and welcoming when you enter the place.  Food has always been great when we came no matter if it is when they open at 4 or at 9:30 before they close.  

All of the steaks are great and perfectly cooked (Sirloin and Ribeye) that we have had.  Hubs has had the lobster bisque and he said it very good. 3rd favorite out of all the various restaurants we have been to across country.  Salmon has a wonderful maple butter on top with a pistachio crust. slightly pink.  

So not your 5 star steak house you would get in Vegas or big cities but a nice chain that caters to a bit finer dining experience."}
{"text":"Everything was pretty good when we decided to dine here - the service, the food, the price. 

Appetizers:
1) Baked Goat Cheese (warm goat cheese with crushed almonds and tomato basil salsa - $8)
2) Spinach salad (spinach, strawberries, dried cranberries, candied pecans and red onion in a chardonnay vinaigrette with goat or bleu cheese - $7)

Entrees:
1) Prime rib - medium rare
2) Filet - medium rare

The steaks were really good considering the price. We also ordered a glass of red wine and beer with our meal which were reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Thanksgiving dinner!

We didn't feel like destroying the kitchen, plus I had a gift card so we made reservations to The Keg. We were escorted to a comfy booth in the back (My seat did have a noticeable large tear in it exactly where you would sit, minor point but you might want to get it reupholstered : ) ). I had the Thanksgiving meal, a three-course of Caesar salad, sliced turkey plate with mashed potatoes, stuffing, cranberry sauce, steamed vegetables, and a cheesecake with pumpkin spice drizzle. I also tried some lobster and the prime rib. 

The Thanksgiving meal was decent, and admittedly their strong suit isn't poultry. The stuffing was a bit mushy, the turkey was tender, but not really inspiring any \"wow\" factor. I did like the cranberry sauce since it wasn't overloaded with sugar like the stuff in the Ocean Spray can is. The mashed potatoes and veggies were very basic, nothing too awe inspiring.

The steak and seafood were a lot better. The prime rib had good flavor, and was a good portion for the price. It's no Durant's prime rib in terms of tenderness, but then again you aren't paying Durant's prices :). The lobster I had was delicious, full of flavor, cooked just right. The cheesecake was pretty basic, and the crust tasted more like sugar than graham cracker.

Service was great and a manager even stopped by each table to make sure everyone was having a good experience here. 

Overall, it's a good option if you're in Tempe and want steak or seafood."}
{"text":"The Keg is a nice place to go to for an upscale dinner date. The restaurant is high class inside. The lighting is dim which I like but I know some people don't. The booths and tables are big so you feel very comfortable. The bread they give you is soft and tastes great while you wait. I got a hamburger and I was very impressed how good it was. They have good fries as well. The price isn't that much higher than other places that aren't as upscale."}
{"text":"I enjoy the Keg. I have been to other locations, but this was my first time at the Tempe Market place location. The atmosphere was very nice and my party and I were able to talk and have a good time. I had some issues with the meal, but in reality I think they were mostly user error. I was going to go for the steak and seafood special, but when my friend ordered a salad, I realized that special did not come with salad. Instead I went for the top sirloin because it said potato and salad - but apparently there is a top sirloin classic. It seems that I ordered the one without the salad. My friend ordered a prime rib and she said she liked it, so I will go with that - but for me, it was under cooked. Prime rib is typically medium rare and pink throughout, but this was solid red like it just came off the Bashsa's shelf. I would have sent it back, but she liked it.

The desserts were excellent. Each person in my party had a different one - the coffee ice cream cake, the cream brulee, the chocolate cake and a cheese cake. YUM-O

The service was good and the quality of the food (although not what I was expecting) was very good. I have learned to listen to my friend and not change my mind at the last minute and to read the menu details before ordering :)"}
{"text":"Was headed to MIM for a concert, didn't figure there was anything available out in the desert - wow, was I wrong. I'd just driven in from L.A. and had no clue about local dining options. Thank you, Yelp reviewers, for leading me here. I was running late and told my hostess who told my server, who managed to get me my dinner in record time. I ate half, packaged the rest for later, and was out of there in under 40 minutes. SERVICE, outstanding food, and acceptable pricing. Winnah all the way."}
{"text":"A fairly ok experience at keg.   Service was primarily the issue.  

When we arrived it took probably almost 15 minutes before waiter arrived.   Then things went better.  But when food arrived he was no where to be seen.  Never saw waiter throughout meal until flagged him down asking for check. He said he had been busy taking care of another table first ...

Food wise it was very good.  The meals including salad entree mushrooms and side choice were fairly affordable for a nice steak house.   Only issue with food would have been that I asked for bernaise sauce and waiter had said it would be in side of all steaks.  Well it was missing from mine (the person who asked for).  I could have mentioned to him if he had ever come back to table). 

Overall I would probably give food 4 star and service 2 star for a 3 rating."}
{"text":"Great service!!! I usually eat my protein last and when I noticed they undercooked my steak, I had politely asked if they could put it on the grill again for a couple minutes. No big deal to me. But the manager came out with a whole new plate including all the sides I had already devoured and comped us dessert. They really go above and beyond. Their food is great but their service is 5-stars."}
{"text":"When we were seated our waiter Greg told us he would be providing us with excellent service, and he did exactly that. He was attentive and timely with his services. The steak is delicious as well as the salad and French onion soup. Great atmosphere! This is really good option if you are in the mood for a steak and baked potato!"}
{"text":"We had the most amazing experience! We were celebrating our wedding anniversary and my husband's birthday. Both occasions were acknowledged by the host and the entire wait staff. Ryan was our server, probably the best around. He was professional, sincere, and was genuinely an awesome associate. He was even training a new associate. He is truly the best! 
The food was phenomenal, very tasty, cooked exactly to order. I especially love the attention to detail- for example, the salads are served in a chilled bowls/plates. I highly recommend the Caesar salad and prime rib. You won't go wrong. :)"}
{"text":"I cant believe we've been to The Keg (this location actually) at least 3 times, and I've never reviewed it!  

We took our friend Ben to dinner here this past Friday night, as a thank you for all he's done for us in preparation of the birth of our son.  7pm on a Friday night and we were seated immediately.  The irony of our table location was, our server was also pregnant!!  LOL  

Great service.  Great food.  Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice now. The first time was amazing. We each had the filet dinners. Very tender, moist and flavorful. Service was friendly and prompt each time.  The second time we came (which was for our anniversary) my filet was very undercooked and when I cut into it, the toothpick was left in it that was supposed to hold the bacon (which was non existent). The manager was exceptional in responding to the issue since I had to wait a while to get a properly prepared steak while my husband ate.  Even with the mixup on my food, due to the way the issue was handled we absolutely hands down will be back. Mistakes happen but it's all in how the establishment tries to correct it, and this places knows how to get it done!"}
{"text":"If you love a classy restaurant & good food you'll love this place! The steaks are to die for! The potatoes, anyway you get them are amazing. We love baked, mashed & twice baked the best!! They make asparagus taste amazing! And their Brussel sprouts can't be beat-- I crave them! My hubby loves their lemonade it's a bit zesty for me! Their table bread is perfection- crusty on the outside & softest ever on the inside! 

We love the outdoor seating, even in the winter! They have a fabulous amount of heaters & a warm fire! Try to make a reservation if you're going on a weekend cause the wait is LONG!"}
{"text":"Made reservations for a Friday night here and everything was on point. The hostess and host were very friendly upon arrival which made a great first impression. Our server was polished and professional and he gave a great run down of the menu as we were first time diners. I had the seared tuna and my boyfriend had the teriyaki steak and twice baked potato. My tuna was cooked perfectly and they were accommodating to the special request for sides I made (plain asparagus and potato). My boyfriends dish was phenomenal. The steak had excellent flavor and the potato was unreal. Highly recommend both! He also had the cheesecake for dessert. I tried a bite and it was perfect. The crust was not dry at all and the cherry sauce added the perfect amount of tartness. Loved the atmosphere too! We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Visited the bar for happy hour last week pre theater. We had eaten there before but were seated at a table. This time the bar felt right and we had heard good things about their happy hour. We were not mis informed!! WOW. The apps in the bar are great!! We had the stuffed mushrooms, the garlic shrimp and the baked brie. The Brie and shrooms were amazing. Te shrimp taste great but the melted cheese on top is somehow not right. Messy and hard to deal with and really not necessary with such good shrimp and garlic sauce. The specialty cocktails are tasty and their house pours are pretty stiff! They have a good crowd for happy hour so getting two seats at the bar was a stroke of luck. Do try the house made potato chips that they put on the bar during happy hour  very very good. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and will return soon!"}
{"text":"Great food and service and the talent is also extraordinary. Consistently top notch food."}
{"text":"Busy day- Saturday before Mother's Day. Food was great and the service was great. The only downside was that our party was seated in the booth right next to the busy kitchen."}
{"text":"3.5*, bumped up for Keg service which is usually pleasant.

NOTE:  No reservations on Friday & Saturdays.

Arrived just after 7pm on Friday, was told the wait would be 30-45mins, but we were texted in less than 30mins.  Texting system worked like a charm!  You were even able to see how much longer the wait would be.

I guess this is where people from the suburbs for special occasions?  Server asked me whether or not we were celebrating anything and this question perplexed me.  To me, the Keg is just a slightly overpriced chain restaurant.  In fact, I completely forgot that it was a steakhouse until I mentioned to my bf that there weren't many vegetarian options.

Menu is quite succinct and it's online.  Anything that's not an App, is around the $20+.  If you're vegetarian, there are only a handful of options.  Lighting is dim, it's fairly noisy (not intimate by any means), it's a full house, and this location is new.

Food was good, no complaints.  They offer free, hot bread to start off your meal.  $18 for a burger is sorta up there.  At least it was juicy and not dry, and bun was fluffy and soft.  I can't speak for the steak because I didn't have it this time 'round.  

No surprises here as you sorta know what you're getting into, it's The Keg."}
{"text":"Okay, this is my first time getting food from this restaurant. The food is so amazing that I'm writing this review as I'm eating it! We called our order in and my husband went and grabbed it. The general manager is the individual who took my order and I wish I remembered his name because he was so helpful and suggested the best food! When it got here, it was still nice and warm and the portions are huge. We both got the rib steak. I got mine cooked medium and my husband got his well done- let me tell you, both were cooked exactly as we asked and the steaks were extremely flavorful and delicious! For sides, we got mashed potatoes, blackened corn, and their rice. The mashed potatoes were good. The blackened corn and rice were PHENOMENAL.  For dessert we got the cheesecake, and it was the perfect ending to a perfect meal! We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"$51 plus tip for filet with bleu cheese crust and lobster tail.  Lobster had no taste.  Filet was ok, but dry and i scraped off the bleu cheese.  I ordered it medium rare.  I won't be back.  The patio outside was nice and had a fireplace.  I wouldn't go here to eat again."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went to the keg last night and it was such a great experience!
We had made an reservation so we were seated immediately. Our table was right by the fireplace so needless to say, the mood was quite romantic. 
Our waiter was polite and super efficient. The food was excellent and the drinks were tasty. 
My steak was probably one of the best steaks I've ever had- and I'm a red meat connoisseur! 

This was my first time at the keg, and I am very satisfied with my experience last night. I will be a returning customer."}
{"text":"I'd love to give this restaurant a 5-star review.  The ambiance, food and service definitely deserves it.  However, we had a little hitch when we first checked in.  Evidently the restaurant manager was at the front hostess section.  He was engaged in a conversation with my mother about seating and reservations when another customer that had previously been seated approached him.  He interrupted his conversation and gave his full attention totally to the other guest.  He left my mother standing there in the middle of the conversation and walked off to assist the other guest.  Rude, rude, rude.  Obviously, she was ready to walk out.  She had definitely been insulted.

We did get seated and the person who seated us apologized for the manager.  That's when we discovered it was the manager.  The food was awesome and the service good but a black cloud continued to hang over the evening."}
{"text":"Tonight I came in for the first time and was not disappointed. Food was very tasty and the service was great! Jesse was our waitress and she was wonderful! Definitely will be back! Awesome place for a date or for a special meal with the family."}
{"text":"I have passed by this restaurant many times visiting Tempe Market Place. I am quite upset that I did not venture in sooner. This place is wonderful! As we walked in we were greeted by very friendly staff members, and were seated right away. It was nice to be at a restaurant to where you receive service as soon as you are seated. We were able to order a few drinks and an appetizer as we looked over our menu. Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu, and even suggested a few options since we were new to the restaurant. Our food came out pretty quick, and was cooked to perfection. Not only was the steak I ordered cooked to my liking, it was juicy and full of flavor. On top of my potato side dish I also received a few veggies. I am not a huge veggie person, but the asparagus and the grilled peppers were a perfect combination with my steak. Pricing wise The Keg isn't too expensive, but it's higher up there. If you are looking for a great steakhouse and are willing to pay a little extra for flavor and a nice setting, this place is definitely worth trying.

I will be going back very soon!"}
{"text":"We had been to The Keg a half dozen times for the food but this time was the most exceptional experience.
From the moment Spencer/Manager held the door open to the end of our dining, this night was spot on!
We were celebrating a very hard 13 hour work day and continued to celebrate with friendly hostess(s), a superb food server Rashad and quality, fresh, tasty Stuffed Mushrooms followed by Pistachio Salmon & Steak Oscar. Our waiter was friendly, professional and respectful. Spencer was assertive, knowledgeable, engaging, compassionate and a true role model in the Food & Hospitality arena."}
{"text":"This steakhouse, hands down, is the best steak house I have ever been to. They bring you sourdough bread with butter while you wait on your food, and it's soft and delicious. Their crabcakes are amazing and they're made with real crab, not the imitation crab that most places use. Their steak (Strongly recommend the New York or Baseball Top) was perfect and required absolutely no sauce to make it taste good, because it was already fantastic. Their garlic mashed potatoes were awesome and not lumpy. The wait staff was friendly, attentive, and my glass was never less than half full.

The price was a bit much, but totally worth it. 


I'd strongly recommend giving this place a shot if you like steak. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Not a fan the people working there were OK but the food was poor I wouldn't go back even if I got a free dinner for 5 sadly"}
{"text":"Rarely have I seen such a breakdown on serving fundamentals.  

My parents & I stopped by here on Thanksgiving Day, since it was the only place that we liked that was open.  Every other experience here before had been a 4 star or better, but that was years ago.  Also know that the restaurant had people, but was not busy at all on the bar side.  The restaurant side was reservation only for lunch and had people, but not busy as well.

I unfortunately forgot our server's name, but she was a 20 something female.  She was quick to great us with waters.  When we were not ordering alcohol that is when things took a turn.  She took a bit to bring the iced teas out & did not bring sweetener.  My father had to ask several times before we received it.  When she finally took our order that was the death blow.  We ordered three wedge salads & I had the sirloin added to mine. We have a big, early Thanksgiving dinner and did not want to get stuffed.  After that we could not get her to come by for anything.  We had to ask other servers for drink refills (I hate doing that).  After about 45 minute wait for our salads (mind you the place was not busy), we received my mom's wedge, mine with the sirloin, but my dad's was missing.  She forgot to ring his up.  So the food runner got his within 5 minutes, amazing how quickly they can get them out when stuff is messed up.  Going back to the food drop, we all still had empty drinks & no silverware.  When they brought our silverware out, they never brought out a steak knife; I had to ask for that as well.  

Finally the taste of the food. The lettuce was super wet, so much so that the dressing wouldn't stick.  My steak was almost room temp and the steak knife had a hard time cutting through it.  

My dad got a little snarky and made a comment about how bad things were to one of the other servers trying to help out. Alexa, the manager, finally stopped by.  She asked us how everything was going, mom & dad started going off.  I stopped them and spoke calmly to her.  She ended up apologizing for things not being great and comped our meal (for three it probably was $40).  She did a 4-1/2 star job.  The server was so bad & the food was not good, that I could not justify over a 2 star rating. 

Will I be back?  I will give them another shot when I am in town since the other experiences have been 4 star or better."}
{"text":"Have to give a high rating cause again the food, the waitress Jenaya was absolutely wonderful. The food was hot and fresh, drinks kept full. One of the managers Carlos stopped by to make sure all was good. Overall the experience was great, recommend highly."}
{"text":"Good sized portions, steaks and sides are flavorful. I'm not too sure about the locations in the United States, but my favorite location is the one at Banff, Alberta (Canada). The steaks up there are dry aged so they develop a great depth of flavor."}
{"text":"Good was good.  Had a party of 20 for a birthday. Service was good.  But they ran out of Prime rib......  Kind of a let down right there. That was the main thing I wanted to try.  Other than that the steak was good.  Cooked it exactly how I wanted it to be."}
{"text":"The Keg is a fun place to eat. The bar has good tv screens and the drinks are good. This time I ordered the prime rib but I much prefer their rib eye. My friend ordered a new menu item, their salmon. It was delicious and smooth as butter. For dessert my friend ordered the brownie with ice cream and whipped cream- that was amazing."}
{"text":"I came here during restaurant week and I ordered a bacon wrapped filet mignon with shrimp and scallops. Came with an appetizer of  buttered shrimp and a dessert (I ordered crème brulée but they didn't have it so I picked carrot cake). 

The buttered shrimp appetizer was pretty good. The filet mignon was the best. I always get it medium rare and it always hits the spot. The shrimp and scallops were a bonus.

They didn't have the dessert I wanted but the Carrot cake (à la mode) was a big slice (like 1/4 of a regular carrot cake). I'm sure I would've gotten diabetes if I ate all of it but I took a few bites and finished the ice cream.

The price was pretty good, all of that was $39. In my opinion this is a little bit better than Mortons."}
{"text":"This was our first time, we were so glad to be able to make a reservation, when we arrived at 6 there were people waiting.

Our server introduced herself right away . The service was excellent. I took advantage of the ordering from the Keg Classic New York Strip (12oz.) which had the benefits of a salad, Sauteed Mushrooms and a choice of accompaniment. My dining partner just ordered a New York Strip (12oz.) which came with your choice of accompaniments.

If you are dining here for an unbelievable steak like you might find at Ruth Chris or BLT, then this is the wrong place, BUT for the price and a well seasoned steak it is very good. My Classic was $35 and the other was $29, very very reasonable.

Excellent service, good food and fun time had. P.S. I would have had photos but where we were seated was to dark. Sorry"}
{"text":"Have been here a few times and this is the great review I have left.  It gets fairly busy here but patio is open seating and we were able to find a table within 15 minutes.  The patio/bar area is very large so you shouldn't have a problem and there is a nice seating area around a fire pit as well that just adds to why sitting outside is the fall is the way to go.  

While everyone was friendly my only grip was that service was a bit slow, but it wasn't anything that ruined the night.  We ordered our meal and while mine was excellent, ( steak cooked a perfect medium-rare ) with excellent mixed vegetables.  My girlfriend ordered a sirloin and she wanted it medium-rare, but it was clear once she cut into that is was very rare.  While she did her best to eat around the rarest parts we did mention this to our server.  

This next part is why I'll come back.  While they offered to re-cook her steak she graciously declined since we had to leave.  The waitress then came back and had offered us two free desserts as a small consolation prize.   While it was incessant we were more than pleased with the service provided and will have no reservation about ever coming back."}
{"text":"Birch gave it \"the best steak he's ever had\".  Wish I could be there...."}
{"text":"Found this place via yelp and hotel bar staff recommendation. 

This place is in an odd location but don't even worry about it. Inside atmosphere is relaxing and comfortable. 

Price is per usual for a steakhouse. Not too expensive, not cheap. With drinks it was about $100CAD per head. 

Wait staff was very knowledgeable and friendly. Christina was our waitress... she was very attentive. 

The food was solid. I had a New York strip with a twice baked potato. Good stuff! I I ordered it medium rare but it came out just a tidbit more towards medium. The flavor was good and it was juicy so I didn't worry about that too much. 

Good for a business dinner!  Enjoy, eh!"}
{"text":"10 oz prime rib was ordered medium rare, came out rare, sent back, came back medium. Was over salted. Meat was tough, Had to be grade below choice. Dinner to celebrate friend's birthday. Restaurant was her choice, my first time there. Won't go back. Ordered side of creamed spinach for $5.00 was actually cheese spinach , tasted good, we each got 1.5 tablespoons. But not real creamed spinach. Waiter friendly but acted like he was on speed. Gave us two minuscule scoops of ice cream for her birthday. His compliment. 
We both had identical dinner. Iceberg lettuce quarter. Ok. Baked potato good; same at Wendy's for 1.79; 4 green beans and two small pieces of red pepper cooked fine. Friend gave me balance of her baked potato and prime rib for my dog. Will have to cut off fat before giving it to dog. All this cost 89.00 plus tip. For a chain this was worse than normal. Save your $$$$ and go somewhere else. Even Outback is better."}
{"text":"WOWWWWW what a disappointment! Ive eaten at the Keg one other time about 10 years ago. I knew it was a bit pricey but dont mind pricey for delicious food. 
We were able to get seated right away, that was the only good thing. 
I am not exaggerating, we waited an HOUR...a FULL HOUR not almost an hour, before our entrees came out. (A monday night, 4 of us)
Getting a water was impossible. I was finally able to get a glass of (tap) water on my 4th request. 
The food....sooooo not worth it. I make a good rib eye but this was not close to comparable for a $66 rib eye steak (for 2) My baked potato was basic. My bf's chicken seafood dish was bland. 
Never ever again."}
{"text":"I work right by the Keg so it is the perfect spot for me and my co workers to go to for happy hour. We always sit at the bar and all the bartender and servers know some of my co workers who go in all the time and always extremely friendly. 

The food on the happy hour menu is all extremely tasty ! If you order the baked brie, nachos , or ahi tuna tacos you can't go wrong. Also, the prime rib sliders ( not on happy hour anymore) are amazing and very filling for 3 sliders!  

Good selection of beers and all of their different cocktails I have tried have all tasted great. I love that anytime I order a cocktail and from different bartenders, that they always taste that they were all made exactly the same way, which I think is hard to find at bars. 

Will always continue to go here for happy hour and would recommend this place for happy hour to anyone or a good date night spot."}
{"text":"This place used to be good but it's past its prime. The steak was cooked well and tender but it was not well seasoned. The crab legs were dry and overcooked. The bread was stale and tasted bad. The waiter was really nice and the restaurant was clean but it was not worth the price we paid for the meal. I would not recommend this place anymore."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times and it's pretty darn good! Staff is always friendly and knowledgeable of the food. I love their prime rib and crab while my boyfriend's loves the baseball cut steak. We're going here for Valentine's next week so we're excited to return!"}
{"text":"In all honesty, I wasn't expecting a whole ton when my boyfriend brought me here for our anniversary.  (Now before I sound like a terrible girlfriend, in my defense, it's in Tempe Marketplace next to BevMo and Red Robin - not where I'd expect an outstanding steakhouse.)  But boy, was I wrong.

The steak was amazing.  I'm not gonna pretend to be an expert on steaks, but I thoroughly enjoyed mine.  It was very juicy, and tasty on its own - mind you, this is coming from someone who douses every steak she's ever eaten in A1.  Although they do seem to count the number of green beans they put on your plate (5, if I remember correctly), but it's not like anyone's there for the veggies.  I'd also highly recommend the twice baked potatoes for a side if you're not calorie conscious, and even if you are.

The service too, was exceptional.  Not in your face, but there when you needed them.  They had taken note that it was our anniversary, so every waiter and manager that came by made it a point to wish us, even remembering how long we had been together (I was a little taken aback, honestly).  Oh!  And they also served us this amazing cheesecake, on the house, since we chose to celebrate our anniversary with them.  I was stuffed as it is, but you know how girls are with desserts.

That said, I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a decent steakhouse in this college town.  Like any decent steakhouse, it is a little on the pricey side, but well worth it."}
{"text":"First time coming with friends who had been before. Stellar service & food. 
I got the New York strip mid rare with iceberg wedge salad to start. All of it was delicious. 
Pretty pricey but it is worth the money for the quality and experience, in my opinion. Definitely a place to go to for special occasions."}
{"text":"The baseball top sirloin is the best steak I've ever had. The service was top notch too. The Billy Miner pie is great for dessert."}
{"text":"Keg's are pretty standard.
Had the crab/steak special that is running right now, and the crab was decent.

Only (obvious) pain is that it is RIGHT beside the main runway of Pearson. So you have massive jets taking off and landing. Not the most romantic patio lol
inside is fine though, just the patio's unfortunate location.

(Another instance when i wish i could rate it a half star for 2.5, but i'll give it a 3, based on tasty warm bread, and a tasty Gamay)"}
{"text":"Definitely a big change from the former West Mall Keg! It is gorgeous inside, can't wait to see what the patio situation is upstairs in the summer. 
The former West Mall was a different experience, more proper steakhouse feel...but it was starting to really show its age. 

On a Friday night, we were told a 45min-1hour wait and took the buzzer. We were lucky enough though to find a seat at the bar. It was pretty busy in there as well, so we were lucky. I believe there are Open Table bookings, but only on off-days.

Our salads came very quickly.
Our mains also came quickly and were both perfectly cooked.

I look forward to coming on a bit quieter of a night to really get a feel for the place, but we didn't experience any opening pains or issues with staff. Our bartender/server was very good and attentive despite being as busy as he was."}
{"text":"There are few times in life when a meal is so expertly crafted it is nothing short of genius, I just had one of those meals. The blue cheese filet was perfection! 
The atmosphere is wonderful at the Keg! Celebrating my anniversary I chose to come here because they never disappoint. Service is impeccable, and it too never disappoints. I would highly recommend the Keg for a great meal, and a great night out!"}
{"text":"Bad experience.  Food was cold.  Filet was tough and not seasoned.   Used to be a good place to eat, but way overpriced for the quality of food.   Next time will go to Ruth Chris or Black Angus.  Anything would be better.  Again, it wasn't about the price, it was about the severe lack of quality."}
{"text":"The best sea bass ever! Gorgeous meals and excellent service! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My wife loved it. I ordered a steak at medium temperature and it came out well (to extra well) done. The service was great."}
{"text":"Got a gift certificate so we thought we'd give it a try. It's so close to our house but we haven't heard good things about it. We've been told prices are high and the steak quality is poor. I got the prime rib and it was so dry that it soaked up all the juice they gave and was still too dry to even finish. My wife got the bacon wrapped apples filet and the bacon wasn't nearly cooked, the steak however managed to be way over cooked the outer 1/4\" and red in the center. It didn't looked like the same piece of meat. My son got the sirloin and his looked to be the best cooked by very very fatty. Mashed potatoes tasted like the were from a box and were a solid block on my plate. My wife's loaded baked potato was good. We got nachos for an appetizer and they were the greasiest nachos. I rarely go out to dinner and leave hungry, especially a steak house but we boxed up all the steaks to give to our dogs and are going to get something to eat somewhere else now."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night it was an all together good experience. My only gripe would be the price points of the entrees. The service was good and the bread was great (which is usually a rest indicator of how the rest of the meal might go). I ordered the prime rib it was done to my specifications and the horseradish was a good accent. Otherwise no complaints or problems. Ambiance was great and the wait wasn't all that long."}
{"text":"Would def reccomend this place for a date night. For steak I would reccomend the new york striplion steak with twice baked potato and also for beverages that are non alcoholic blackberry lemonade is amazing. Service was great! If youre coming here with friends get the tuna tatare & brie appetizer"}
{"text":"The name of this place is deceiving. It's upscale, fine-dining, candle-lit, and a hip feel.. It reminds me of Houston's Steakhouse. The server was kinda air-heady, and service was slow. The shrimp cocktail was standard, but the shrimp was huge. Wedge salad was good. It was a chunk of iceberg with all the dressing on top and bacon, bleu cheese. Spinach salad had goat cheese, fresh walnuts and strawberries. It wasn't as good as Houston's, but not bad. On to the good stuff: I had the Seafood Sirloin. Perfect steak with scallops, asparagus, and mixed vegetable (mushrooms, peppers, and squash.) There was a lobster claw that was cracked. Sooo good. My sis got steak and a half lobster. It was a full pound. Excellent restaurant!"}
{"text":"Wow! Blown away by this place. No wonder their pricey...the food, staff and atmosphere are well worth it. Had the Thai chicken with creamy mashed potato. It was accompanied with asparagus and sweet yellow and red peppers. Very flavourful with nicely done chicken that I wish did not end.  The portions are the correct sizes too."}
{"text":"First time at The Keg in Gilbert AZ tonight. Nice, upscale steakhouse that had a feel of Ruth Cris with prices to match.  Ordered escargot, bone-in ribeye, and garlic mashed potatoes.  The escargot came with mushroom caps cooked in some sort of beef broth.  It had a strange taste and rubbery snails with a total lack of seasoning, very off-putting.  The ribeye saved the day though, a 20 oz bohemoth grilled to perfection and the potatoes were good.  All in all, worth the $34 for the steak, but the $8 escargot was in the loss column."}
{"text":"This was a fantastic dining experience! We made a reservation on Open Table, and we were seated immediately. Carlos (I assume the manager) seated us and was courteous, professional, and even checked on us during the meal. Everything we ate was top-notch! Starting with warm sourdough and extremely fresh dinner salad. The burger was okay, but the blue cheese filet, rib eye, and portobello plate were amazing! The rib eye was one of the best I've ever had--highly recommend. 

Our server, Leo, did a great job!!"}
{"text":"We ate here last night and had a great experience. We started off in the pub first while we waited for our table. The drinks came fast and with some home made chips. The service by Aaron in the dining romm was outstanding! We ordered the specials and they were cooked to perfection! I highly recommend the Keg for a great night! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"After walking around the area we decided to eat an early dinner at The Keg. It was not long after they had opened for the day and we were sat at a nice large booth in the back. Our waitress came to tell us about their Winter specials menu and I decided to try the black cod with citrus soy glaze that was featured because I figured if they only had it special for the season it must be good. Everyone at our table had beer but I ordered an iced tea that ended up tasting bitter and the glass was so tiny I needed at least three refills throughout the meal. The bread that came out was eh, not very flavorful and a little too doughy for my liking. 

Our food arrived and my plate looked so sad, the fish was a lump of off white colored mush and smaller than my palm. Also on the plate: my baked potato, two chunks of red pepper and two asparagus spears. I tried to keep an open mind but on the first bite of fish I realized my gut instinct was right. The texture was as mushy as it looked, and there was NO FLAVOR, no \"citrus soy glaze\" no seasoning, nothing. It was slimy and just ick. I tried to squeeze some lemon but that just disguised the flavor, the mush factor was still awful. The vegetables were bland as well, I had to put lemon juice on the asparagus. The only good thing I ate were the mushrooms my boyfriend's sister didn't want and gave to me because I love mushrooms, and they were quite good, probably the high point of my meal. I didn't want to be rude at such a \"fine dining\" establishment so I politely ate my meal as I didn't want to ruin everyone's fun by complaining about my dish to our waitress. But for a $23 Winter \"special\" I was appalled. That fish shouldn't even be served at a cheap buffet.

Barely two stars for the ambiance, our waitress being sweet and fun, and the mushrooms. I will find a different place to eat when shopping here next time."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love coming to The Keg. The nachos that they have on happy hour are superb. My favorite drink I've gotten here would be the red sangria. It's so tasty and potent. As sad as this is...I order the same entree every time we go....the Supreme Chicken Breast. The Demi glaze that comes with the chicken and mashed potatoes is like liquid gold. Sooo amazing. Not one bad thing to say about this place. Give them a try....awesome food and awesome service."}
{"text":"We went to the new Keg Steakhouse near the North York centre on Monday night. The restaurant is nicely decorated and the staff was very friendly and accommodating. We came here before on Saturday night and were told we have to wait 90 minutes for a table. So we glad we were able to get a table without waiting.

I ordered the prime rib dish with mashed potatoes. The prime rib dish was well seasoned and delicious. My friend ordered the sirloin steak. She was happy with her steak.

Would we go back? Yes. The staff was super friendly and the food was very good."}
{"text":"Be sure to sign up on their website for birthday discounts.  Great steaks, quality bar, outdoor option is a preference for many, meals come with bread."}
{"text":"The food was ok/good. I was kind of surprised. I felt like it was overpriced and I would have been happier going somewhere else for less and getting the same quality of food."}
{"text":"Update.

I went in again a few weeks ago to use my birthday coupon.  I know, I know.  I ragged about this place horribly, and then still went back.  You'd think I just like to complain or something.  ;)  But, $25 is $25, so what the hell.

And...it didn't suck!!  For the first time ever, we did not get plates stacked upon each other.  

They've really cleaned up their service, so they get a star back.

Food is the same - good value for the price.

Good job, Keg!  :)"}
{"text":"This was my first time a the restaurant and it was very good.  I had a very tasty steak that was cooked to perfection.  It was juicy and full of flavor.  When my order came I didn't get everything  I asked for.  The backed potato came plan instead of with everything on it.  So told the waitress and within 3 min a new baked potato was on the table with everything on it :).  To my surprise she left the other potato there too.

The service was very good and the atmosphere was warm and cozy.  I will be going here again and again."}
{"text":"This time ain't so good. We had a reservation and was seated in a dark and crappy area while there was a lit, unreserved table. Then came the waiting. We waited and waited and finally had to remind the waiter to grab the drinks. Then the food came. We got a prime rib, a Baseball Top Sirloin, a Sirloin Oscar and a New York striploin. The prime rib was under cooked and it took a while for it to be fixed. Then the striploin was supposed to have sauteed mushrooms which to them is only 4. Though the manager was really nice and the desert was great. This might be the last time we go there."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great, the location is great, but the food sadly cannot live up to the ambiance. I had the teriyaki sirloin, but there was nothing teriyaki about it. I couldn't even tell if the meat had been marinated in sauce. The meat lacked flavor and was incredibly bland. 

With that being said, I can't complain about the service. However, I won't be making a trip back for such mediocre, expensive food."}
{"text":"Took a chance & went there for the first time for our anniversary. The Keg did not disappoint! The shrimp & lobster salad was amazing and the steak blew us out of the water! 
The waiter was very professional, friendly, and helpful.
Will definitely go back - especially when we want a good steak!"}
{"text":"We love this place. The food is always wonderful, but the service is exceptional. I've been to several other Keg Locations and this one has the best service. Ask Christa about all of the different ways you can order a steak - Chicago style is a thing! Or see if you can get in Amber's section b/c she is super thoughtful and attentive. My favorite restaurant. For Celiac's- they got you covered. Order the Brie with tortilla chips instead. Delicious! Remember to ask for the Gluten Free menu."}
{"text":"First timers. Loved the smell and decor as soon as we walked in. The hostesses were all dressed like a Robert Palmer video. Went there for my husband's birthday. On a Monday right at 4 pm.  Seated in a cozy booth, even without a reservation. Daniella was our server. She is a pro from start to finish, polished. I am vegetarian. She was kind and patient and knowledgeable in response to my questions, AND she did not fake it or guess if she didn't know. Hubby had the tuna tartare appetizer, he loved it. The avocado base looked appealing.  He then had crab and steak for an entree. He made delicious noises throughout his meal. I had a green salad to start, the dressing was delightful and he veggies were all crisp and cold.  The cherry tomatoes had refreshingly tomato flavor! For my entree I tried the cauliflower \"steak\". It was interesting. I liked the char flavor. It did not blow me away but it was creative. Manager comped us desert for the birthday, which was very cool. It was delicious. A slice of ice cream pie. This is an upscale experience in the middle of a maddening shopping center. I was surprised to be so impressed with a desert ridge restaurant. We will be back...for Valentine's Day."}
{"text":"I had the lobster and steak, was excellent. Kudos to the bartender Courtney for recommending the twice baked potato and providing excellent service, it was phenomenal. Classy vibe in the place, would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"My co-workers and I have tried going here for happy hour drinks/food twice. The restaurant is great. Don't get me wrong but, I don't think they know how to deal with a large party. I've even called ahead and all they say is well we can't accommodate you until you've arrived and then they run around like a chicken with their head cut off for 10 minutes pushing together 2 tables. Pretty good prices overall though."}
{"text":"I had dinner at this location last night. I sat in the bar area for happy hour and also had dinner.

Wine: Pinot Noir by the glass was awesome! 

 I started with the baked brie which was O-K, I probably wouldnt order it again because I prefer a breaded baked brie. It was the pefect size for two.

Entree: Filet Oscar Rare: Cooked perfectly. I loved the summer veggies and the scallops were also cooked perfectly. I did have ONE issue. I ate part of a shell because one of the seafood items were not properly shucked. The server appologized and showed her mananger... But it still kind of ruined the positive vibes of the entree. I probably would give this place 5-stars if this had not happened. It was a pretty large chunck and it crunched in my teeth. I was on a date so I didnt want to spit it out so I swallowed some of it. EW. 

Dessert: Miners Pie- AWESOME. I really liked this. & Decaf coffee & Bailys.

Service: Great. We had a female server who was very sweet. She was a petite brunette and she seemed very knowledgable about the menu items."}
{"text":"Went to The Keg with my wife as she had never been and Flemings was booked.  The staff was very accommodating and friendly.  The server was excellent.  He checked in often, presented himself very well and was attentive to our needs.  We had a bottle of Ridge that was delicious.  The brie appetizer was very good.  Now onto the steak:  Each of us ordered a bacon wrapped filet medium rare.  Unfortunately, the steak came wrapped in bacon fat and was cooked closer to rare vs medium rare.  At times I'll order my steak rare or rare + so this wasn't a problem for me, but the bacon grizzle was unappetizing.  We had the creme brulee for dessert and it was average.  The Keg does a good job, but if the could pay a little more attention to detail with respect to the food.  I think they try and turn out the food too fast and it just doesn't compare to other steak houses.  Definitely a AAA club.  If you want a real steak go to Flemings or Ruth Chris for a Big League experience."}
{"text":"Service has gone down hill. I went to the keg in Chandler and had an amazing experience so decided to go to this one with friends before a show at Gammage. The prime rib tasted nothing like the one I had at the other Keg. It was not as flavorful and my husband had the fried chicken and it was burnt. All three of us were unimpressed with our meals. Will not go to this location again, and likely, not another Keg at all. Not sure what's changed but it was not a good experience."}
{"text":"We ate here for my husbands birthday on Monday and everything was perfect.....our waiter Jeff was spot on and very nice to talk to, steak cooked perfectly and I love their Caesar dressing! The final treat was a piece of the pie which even though we were very full we somehow managed to indulge every last bite!!! Thank you for making his birthday one to remember!!"}
{"text":"Favorite steak place so far in the east valley. I love their salmon and steak is really good. Great salads. Been here a few times and would highly recommend it to people visiting from out of town."}
{"text":"The food was excellent.  My husband and I both had the sirloin steak which were perfectly cooked.  The sides were very generous - I ordered the asparagus and it looked like they gave me a whole pound.  My husband ordered the salad and baked potato.  Service was very good - the restaurant was very busy and the servers were quite busy.  Two managers stopped by our table to ensure everything was ok."}
{"text":"We are here visiting from California and tried The Keg based on the Yelp reviews. We made a 7:00pm reservation.  The shopping plaza it is located in was very busy. The restaurant was equally as busy. We were seated quickly. Our service was so so. Our waiter was overwhelmed.  Others filled our drinks and we never did get the other loaf of bread we asked for. The food was amazing. I had the mushroom stuffed chicken. Everyone else had the prime rib. We loved it all. The Brussel sprouts were a little tough, though. I prefer them softer. Overall, I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is our go to when we want steak. Great atmosphere, very good food, and nice selection of cocktails. I love the wedge salad, twice baked potato, ny strip.  This location needs to work with their servers. We still go to this location, but service lately has been horrible- bad attitudes and staff not keeping up with tables."}
{"text":"Straight Up!  This Steakhouse will blow your mind!  After it took us three amazing appetizers ( shrimp Neptune, bacon wrapped scallops and stuffed mushrooms ) we were finally able to decide on our meals.  The Rib Steak was the best!  Full and juicy.  Perfect.  Pure. What else do you say?  You say try the Blue Filet.  It will blow your mind with all favors!!!!  

Morgan was HANDS DOWN the best server we have had the pleasure of dining with.  I promise if you eat here, and Morgan is your server, you will be ecstatic with her!   

Do not pass this one up!!!"}
{"text":"I came here for my husband's company Christmas party, which means I didn't pay for the meal - thank goodness. Why anyone would spend $60 on a chain restaurant meal, I'll never know. It was a very uninspired, basic steakhouse taste experience, gluey mashed potatoes and all. If you consider yourself a foodie, this place is not for you."}
{"text":"Amazing filet mignon. Amazing.

Nice atmosphere until they turned the lights down at which i asked for a lantern but was denied.

Wonderful service, absolutely wonderful.

Shrimp cocktail is generous and yummy.  Again, good sea food in the middle of the desert, I'm still scratching my head, but try it none the less.

Did i mention the filet mignon?  Do it."}
{"text":"Great service. Food, not as good as the service. Perhaps I'm spoiled by the steaks in Texas or at City Hall in Scottsdale. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"How does this place stay in business?  After my bad experience years ago I figured it must have been me and I should give them another chance.  It was just as bad.  If you think a reservation at The Keg means a table's reserved for you, think again. We were left cooling our heels for 15 minutes in a lobby with no place to sit, eventually walked through a dining room where half the tables were vacant, then attempted to be seated in the ugly back room. Server was great but the food was not worth the money. Prime rib was tough and way overdone. Their asparagus comes with nothing on it, not even any salt or butter. Just a bad place for 2 people to drop $100."}
{"text":"Came again for my birthday on June 25th. Jen had called ahead to makenzure we could get a table and they had a birthday card signed by the staff. Kind of cheesy but it is the little added touches like that that make places like this stand out above the rest. 

We ordered the bacon wrapped scallops as an app as we do every time we come here because they are awesome and we are never disappointed; and again this was the case.  Jen and I both ordered prime rib. Key factor when ordering prime rib, always ask why they started cooking it.  Any place that serves prime rib for lunch doesn't slow coom it to perfection and you are most likely getting good yesterday's left overs. The Keg starts early in the morning and the prime was delicious.  Served at the exact mid rare specifications we ordered it at. The au jus was great.

After the meal the manager brought us a free dessert, not a scoop of ice cream with whipped cream, a real dessert off their menu, and wished me a Happy Birthday thanking us for choosing The Keg to spend my birthday at.  Additionally, our server was very good.  Attentive the right amount and possessed what I like to call \"silent service\".  Not every visit to our table was an interruption. He was great. 

I have to say I have not checked in nor written a review every time we have dined here and want to stress that I have yet to have anything less than a great experience here in every category each and every time we have came here.  I love this place."}
{"text":"The keg never disappoints! Been here several times and I've never been given bad service,food or otherwise.we are going again in a few days for a birthday and can't wait! Their green chili cream corn is heaven! Meats are fabulous,and customer service is on point! Love!"}
{"text":"Service was wonderful, as was the atmosphere, but I found the food lacking...

We showed up and were seated immediately. Our group was waiting for another individual, so we looked through the drink menu (Coors Light on tap as a featured beer, seriously? WTF) and ordered our drinks while we waited. I ordered a Mojito and was expecting greatness, but was SO disappointed. The drink was super bland, no sweetness or mint flavor. Sad way to start out the evening.

Our fourth guest arrived and we ordered our appetizers (Calamari and Escargot) and ordered a bottle of wine for our meal. The Wine list was disappointing, but the wine we chose ended up being suitable. The Calamari was alright, not as crispy as I would have liked, but a nice flavor. The Escargot was also decent, but the flavor was a bit off. 

I had ordered Prime Rib with a Twice Baked Potato and shared the Truffled Mac & Cheese with a friend. The Prime Rib was very tasty, but also super fatty and didn't have a nice char on the outter edge - which happens to be my favorite part of the prime rib. The Twice Baked Potato was alright, but nothing special. The Truffled Mac & Cheese was made with truffle oil and was actually very delicious... I wish I could have eaten more of that!

For dessert, we shared a Brownie Sundae and the brownie was glorious! I wish the ice cream could have matched it, but no worries... delicious brownie ftw.

The atmosphere was great, as was the service. 

All and all, the experience wasn't horrible and I would likely be back and order a steak and some mac & cheese with no drinks from the bar."}
{"text":"We went to the Keg at Desert Ridge for Restaurant Week.  The deal was $44 for a three course meal.  There were plenty of options on the special menu.  The young ladies checking us in were absolutely charming, professional, and efficient.  Once seated, our waiter was equally charming, professional, and efficient, as were the other members of the wait staff.  Simply wonderful service from start to finish.  As marvelous as the service was, the food was equal to the challenge.  My 20 oz bone-in rib steak (not to be confused with rib eye) was outer worldly.  Perfectly seasoned,  Perfectly cooked as I ordered it.  The accompanying mushrooms were sauteed and seasoned perfectly, as well.  The green beans were al dente and delicious.  The wine list is really good, and the prices are very, very reasonable.  Restaurant Week or not, Keg, here I come!"}
{"text":"Split the bacon wrapped scallops, they were good.  The bacon had great flavor but wasn't as crispy as I like it...but I know that's difficult because of the cook time for scallops.  I had the crab leg entree, it looked like more than a pound, it is a big serving.  The meat was dry, which was a bit weird.  My husband did the steak and half lobster, he said they were fine, nothing wrong but nothing to rave about.  We both had the sangria (red) and we liked it a lot.  I would come back for cocktails and snacks but probably not dinner.  2 dinners, 1 appetizer and 2 drinks was $98 so prices aren't bad."}
{"text":"We waited for 10 minutes for the table. Service is great and food is good.

The one we enjoyed most is actually the bread. The warm bread is so good! The butter served with it has some spices in it and taste pretty good. We ended up had two bread. 

Tuna taco is tasty with fresh tuna on it. The Prime Rib is just ok. The meat doesn't have much of flavor. The fried onion in it is a pleasant surprise.

Overall, it's a good place. Hard to find something to eat near the airport area, especially many places closed for new year day."}
{"text":"Went to the keg on Friday night 9:30pm. No wait, seated quickly. Then waited along time for drink orders. Server was very cold, she came back to take meal order. I ordered prime rib, server told me they are out of prime rib apologized and then stood there looking at me. I said ok give me some time to pick something else, she said I will send your appetizer order to kitchen, she left and we never seen her again. I said to my wife there's lots of other restaurants in Brampton lets go I'm hungry and don't feel like waiting any longer for a meal I wasn't looking forward too. We drove over to the keg on main. I asked the hostess do you have prime rib? They said yes. We were seated right away, ordered our food, waitress was very friendly and polite we had a great meal. 
If you want an experience similar to MacDonalds then by all means go to the Bramalea keg, the staff are around the same age and are good order takers. To sum it up the staff their really don't care about you and likely the manager doesn't care either. We have friends in town that refuse to eat at this location. This is my 3rd time going to this location and I have been to lots of kegs and this by far does not feel like a keg again it feels more like the service you would get from a fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"The steak was awesome! The drinks were tasty. The service was great. Our lobster tails were cold and rubbery and they forgot our salads. That is the only reason for 4 stars. We'll be back but only for steak. The twice baked potatoes are yummy.  Almost forgot."}
{"text":"I was a good meal, but not great.  I went with my daughter for a Father's Day Meal and between the 2 of us we dropped $100.  Not sure I would eat here again as I don't think it was much better than any other chain steakhouse.

Our server was very attentive and I have no complaints there.  Where they struggled was in cooking the steaks (Not good considering it is a steakhouse).  My daughter ha the Fillet Medium and it came out Medium Well.  She thought it tasted great, so she ate it anyways, but towards the end it was dried out.  I had the 14oz Prime Rib medium rare which was closer to rare.  It was bland and tasteless. I had to load it up on horseradish (very hot) and dip it in the sauce to make it feel like I was eating something. I was planning on getting the Bone In Rib Eye but was told the Prime Rib was their specialty.  We both had the garlic mash potatoes which were fantastic.  We shared a Miner Pie which was awesome.

If the resturant was cheaper I might give it a pass, but it was not great value for the money.  They are a Steakhouse, and unfortunatley that was the one thing they did not do well."}
{"text":"Ate here for dinner with the bf last night. We arrived right around 415 PM and were greeted by the hostess. No one else in line and we had to wait to be seated and we couldn't figure out why. The dining room was very upscale and I was in jeans and shirt and that seemed to be OK.

About 5 minutes after we were seated Daniel our waiter came by. He was able to answer all of my questions about the menu. I got the Oscar Sirloin and the bf had the NY steak (I believe). 

Fresh bread came promptly to our table and it was tasty, but they don't cut it all the way through so you have to slice it yourself which I found to be frustrating. Especially since they quarter it off center if that makes any sense. 

Oscar Sirloin was cooked to my asking and it is topped with scallops, shrimp, and a bernaise sauce. Comes with a side (I opted for asparagus). It was quite delicious. My boyfriend said his was very good. His steak came with mushrooms, a salad, and for his additional side he opted for the garlic mash potatoes. I tried them, they were very garlicky and were overall OK.

The service was a little slow, Daniel was attentive at first but then disappeared for a little while. The manager Chris also came up to the table and the interaction was a little awkward but oh well.

I would definitely eat here again.

BF's steak classic + my Oscar Sirloin + 3 beers (2 bottles and one tap) about $92 with tax"}
{"text":"To be honest, I've never actually eaten a full meal at the Keg. I am a regular, however, and go in to sit at their bar for drinks and appetizers weekly. The Keg offers something that is rare in the Valley: an atmosphere that is conversation-encouraging. By this I mean the staff get along with each other really well, this shows. This is important because this rubs off on customers and allows them to feel as if they are being included in a group. Even more important: their music is kept at a reasonable volume. I have made so many great friends at the Keg and it's simply because I can talk to them. They have great cocktails, an okay selection of wine and an okay selection of beer but I am comfortable getting drinks I've already had a lot because I know I am still going to have a great time anyways!


Keep singing,

{"text":"Great place!  Took a little work to figure out getting a reso but when I did everything was smooth sailing.  They took great care of my kid ( bonus points duh) BUT we were smart enough to make my reso early to be the first turn.  Food was great, wine pairing (my choice) was great. Take advantage of the Cammeron Hughes selection - I didn't know that was available until too late but I did not feel bad about the Bella Glos selection at all.  We will be back, we will request the same table, very easy nice outing for a celebration..."}
{"text":"First off, best service I have ever had at a restaurant. I know it's not the MOST expensive steakhouse in the Phoenix area but  I've been to two locations (Chandler and Scottsdale) in the Phoenix metro area a number of times each and have NEVER had a rude server. They are always polite, prompt and accurate with the order. The atmosphere is very nice as well. Very clean restaurant (even the restrooms) and relaxing, romantic lighting and sound level. For the west coast, great Lobster in my opinion. Not dry and they serve the butter over a small flame to keep it warm. The steak is the best or second best I've ever had. Not dry either and very tender. Melts in your mouth! Take it or leave it, a great steakhouse experience for the money. To give you an idea, it will cost apx $100 or more for two people but well worth it if you consider other competitors are about $60 for two people and the food well below the standards this place carries. A must try for anybody that enjoys a nice atmosphere and a good steak and Lobster....."}
{"text":"The food was good, a little spendy I wish the happy hour was better.  The bar is very nice and the bartenders are topnotch.  Service was wonderful and prompt, we didn't have to wait at all for our drinks and appetizers."}
{"text":"From the start I had a bit of a chip on my shoulder from the reservation making process. 

Monday morning I find out that I need to make a reservation for 8 people for dinner that night, at 5:30 or 6 p.m. So I quickly get on the phone with the Keg who's answering machine says they are closed but to leave a message and someone will get back to me. Well 5 hours later no one had called me back yet, so I tried again, same thing, I pressed \"zero\" thinking maybe this would work, it did, I got someone in an office somehow. I explained to them what I needed and had been waiting for a phone call back for hours. He didn't seem very concerned, and took my information again, and said someone would call me back. Great! More waiting around. Business dinner, kinda important people, cant wait around all day. 

So I wait, and the hostess calls me back about 15 minutes later. She had a bit of an attitude. She mad it seem like a hassle for us to want to be coming in for dinner. I wasn't sure how quickly we would be able to get there and it might be closer to 6 than 5:30, this was unacceptable to her, \"Its going to have to be 5:30\" Again I explained we would be there as soon as we could. Hello! 8 people, business dinner, one check, minimum $40 a head, what is the problem? You say great see you then and hang up, don't give me shit! I can just as easiyly take the group somewhere else. She told me that the servers would be standing around wondering where the table was and that is why we had to be there by 5:30, NO! Sorry we are not here to cater to the server, Ugh! Sorry done ranting but it was very rude, and for the money we planned to spend I really don't think I needed to deal with the Spanish Inquisition to make dinner reservations. 

Whatever, long story short, we showed up when we did, sat down when we pleased, all was okay in the world. Dinner was fantastic! The server was a doll, helped to suggest a great wine, walked us through the menu perfectly. Everything was essentially seamless. The timing was perfect! This is  probably one of the hardest things to get right in a place like this, and they nailed it. 

So all in all, even though the hostess gave me a hard time, we had a blast. 

Thank you!

PS: Get the mushrooms and garlic mashed, with whatever cut of meat you get, they are all good!"}
{"text":"Last night was our 3rd time here for dinner. As always it was an excellent meal. We had the Dungeness Manhattan with Dungeness Mac and Cheese. Our server was excellent. Always there to help without being intrusive. It was also my wifes birthday and we were brought a large piece of Kona Ice cream to share for dessert. We will be back again. Thank you to the Keg Staff for an enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"Great service and delicious meal. Wished we lived closer because it would be a regular"}
{"text":"Outstanding bar. Great service from the bartenders. Ours made great recommendations and we truly enjoyed our drinks and meal. Bone in rib eye was delicious with maybe less than a spoonful of fat to cut away. The 7 oz filet was so tender a steak knife was not needed. Both of us got the twice baked potatoes and there was some mushroom, red pepper, green beans as part of the main dish. We read that there are about 100 Keg restaurants around but we have never seen them around in all of our travels. We are going to look  a little harder because this is well worth a return visit."}
{"text":"My husband and I were off for the New Years holiday and decided to spend the night out at the Keg. Our service was outstanding! We had drinks and our dinner at the bar. Being in the industry, I appreciated how well the two female bartenders worked together, but even more impressed by the speed and efficiency of the bar back. We will definitely return and will suggest the bar to all of our friends!"}
{"text":"BEST ONE I HAVE BEEN TO 
well.. i have only been to one other location (Richmond Hill) but... in comparison this location was just insanely better. 
LETS TALK DECOR. Like velvet and royal blue seats ?? YES PLEASE. A luxurious second floor with an open concept ?!?! Cant WAIT for patio season. 
This is a seriously romantic upgrade from the cramped mess i went to in richmondhill. 

The service was lovely as well. She was very informative and kind. I loved that she seemed very genuine asking to suit any of our needs!! She was attentive and not intrusive. 

The food was fab ofc 
The keg is always consistent with their food. 
The shrimp cocktail had some giant meaty af shrimp that were fresh as hell and obviously NOT frozen. Delish.
My hunni enjoyed the days feature which was an 8oz sirloin crusted with coffee beans and.. some reduction which i forgot and also added the adiago lobster with it as well. 
Let me tell you how hard it is for him to have a good steak.... he likes it medium and i swear we always get one that is too RAW. but here it was cooked perfectly which definitely earned brownie points from him. 
I had the cauliflower steak, which was veggie heaven. It had chickpeas and asparagus as well and worked very well. 
We enjoyed a mini creme brulee for dessert and it was a good size since our tummies were about to explode. Our bill came short of $130 (tax + tip + alcohol incl.) 
Great date night here !!"}
{"text":"Went to the Keg with 4 family members. We had several different menu item. All of us agreed that the baseball cut sirloin was the best.  Mine was a little overcooked but came out perfect the second time.
Desserts (creme brule) was a little charred. Overall good experience. I did get $25.00 off for being in their bday club. Dessert not included. Well, included,  at my expense. Great atmosphere, quiet place. Professional service."}
{"text":"Kudos to mgr on duty! She took care of us!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stumbled in here on a weekday night and ate at the bar.  We got Santa fe chicken dip, prime rib sliders, and a burger.  Whoa were we blown away! So much flavor.  We really enjoyed ourselves and decided to come again for dinner.  Their prime rib is very good.. and this is coming from a person who LOVES prime rib.  It's the first chain restaurant that I really love.  Comes in big portions and their cocktails are quite yummy."}
{"text":"Came in for the first time on Saturday, May 5th. BTW: You'll have to make reservations prior to dinning!
Our server was Debra. She was good.
My husband had to Ribeye ( Oscar Style) and I had the NY stripe with a lobster tail & clarified butter. Mine included the twice baked potato which was a little dry, but flavor was nice. Steaks were cooked well just as we had requested them.
Our meals were just adequate. So sorry to have to say; it wasn't \"above average or extraordinary\": to stand out in any kinda way that would set them to a higher standard than your typical steak house..Just your average steak, nothing really took it over the top for us. But, the best part of the meal was dessert- the Creme Brûlée.
Although service was good, I don't think it was a memorable enough experience to say we will be back again in the near future."}
{"text":"Parking was a little tough, tis the season right? The staff was friendly, quick and attentive. 

I had the salmon. I know... I know...  it's the Keg but they did the salmon justice. It was cooked to perfection. 

The highlight of my meal was the dessert. YUUUMMMY! The Billy Miner pie was the best ice cream cake I've ever had. just go and get your self a slice!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ate here because we had a gift card.  We both enjoyed our meals.  My steak and baked potato were great.  The customer service was great.  I really enjoyed the inside of this fine establishment and I may be back to try another meal."}
{"text":"If you were smart you'd stop scrolling, drop everything, and read this immediately.

I give this place an easy 5 stars. I booked my reservation on Open Table and we were seated immediately upon entering... Which reminds me... Think back to the first time you went to Disneyland. How about the first time you discovered the jar of powder sugar in the pantry? How about when you were reunited with your biological parents 27 years after growing up and finding out that at birth the hospital sent you home with the wrong family??? Yeah, the feeling I had when I walked in here tonight was something like that. I was home. And I was happy.

Our server was Debbie. Don't mess this up. Make sure you get her as your server. Just as a ship needs a compass and a rudder to guide you through a storm, so too did we need Debbie to lead us to culinary bliss.

The Neptune Mushrooms things were the way to start it off. It prepared us mentally for what was to come.

I ordered a New York Strip because I'm not a 7 year old girl ballet dancer. My wife got the sirloin. If you don't order it medium rare then you probably should just stay home and make a bowl of Cheerios so you don't screw up your life. The steaks were perfect. Like... Fit for Zeus perfect. In fact they may have even been prepared by Him for all I know.

Now enter the double baked potato. Wedge salad. Mushrooms. Peppers. And an extra side of asparagus because why wouldn't you do that?

Perfection. Every. Single. Thing. Perfection.

I washed it down with a Pepsi because the Keg cares deeply about people and knows that Coke is for convicts and the kids from the Sandlot.

It was everything I hoped it would be and more.

{"text":"Excellent customer service. Excellent food at a reasonable price. The keg burger was delicious as were the fries. The garlic shrimp and brie cheese appetizers were very good. All in all a great dining experience."}
{"text":"My kids just got back from a mission trip and wanted steak so we decided on the Keg. Been here a few time and a good choice again. 

I ordered the baby back ribs with garlic mash potatoes and grilled asparagus with red peppers. The ribs were tender and falling off the bone good. Also enjoyed the garlic potatoes and vegetables. My wife had to mustard salmon. Never had anything like this. Very tasty salmon with a touch of a mustard taste. Mustard wasn't overpowering at all. Very good. Our kids had the steak and half lobster. They gobbled it up. So our dinner was very good. 

For desert we had passion brûlée. It was such a small little cup. Come on. You can make it bigger. Also had the Billy Minor ice cream cake. So good. 

The service was exceptional. They filled our water cups and continually asked about our meal. Even the manager stopped by. Very nice. Overall, we had a very enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in thanksgiving dinner at The Keg Chandler. The turkey was not even sliced- just a pile of meat on the plate, average at best mashed potatoes, horrible veggies and the cranberry sauce was served in a plastic cup. To top it off, the cheesecake was still frozen in the middle. Sorry but The Keg is off my list for any holiday and quite honestly, don't think we'll be dinning there again."}
{"text":"Solid. Prompt and courteous service. Good drinks and decent wine list. 

I had crab Mac n cheese to start. Spectacular. Then prime rib, perfectly cooked and terrific cut. Fresh horseradish without asking. 

Veggies cooked Al Dante , tasty mini desert and coffee. 

Prompt bill, nice atmosphere , and smiling help."}
{"text":"Really surprised! We went to the Keg a few years ago and it was ok. We live in n. Scottsdale so there is no shortage of good steakhouses, but we decided to try the Keg again. Both mine and my husband's steak was excellent-a lot of flavor and the \"grilled\" taste. More importantly, I could eat every morsel of my filet mignon because it was quality meat. For the price it was well worth the meal. Our server, Brad was really on top of things and made the meal relaxing because he was on it with food and drinks. I have to say good service is not to be taken for granted, even the hostesses were welcoming. All around a great experience!"}
{"text":"Visiting from connecticut and have never been in a keg steakhouse. We ate in the bar area and waitress courtney was pleasant, informative and very nice.  Manager came over to apologize for delay in my chop salad. It took a long time.  They apologized up front, again and manager came back to make sure steaks were cooked right and hot.  Courtney had us comped desert and they also went above and beyond with an additionial discount.   They made sure we were over satified manager was rob I think.  They make sure to take care of you and care.  Ask to have courtney as your server I will when I come back"}
{"text":"Much better than the abomination that is Outback.  Better than Firebirds.  Not as good as Ruth's Chris or Flemings.

Great place for lunch as the burgers are great (although the fries are not good).  For dinner, it's ok.  The wedge salad is forgettable.  The crab stuffed mushrooms were pretty good, but a little too much cream cheese.  The sides (mashed potatoes for my wife and a loaded baked potato for myself) were ok.    

The steak (bone in rib-eye for myself and a filet for my wife) were very flavorful.  Although not prime cuts, the preparation was very nice.  I usually prefer broilered steak.  This was the first time I really enjoyed a fire grilled steak.  An added plus was that the rib eye actually was mostly eye.  A lot of places will give you a rib eye and the eye is as big as my thumb.  Not here.   I appreciated that."}

The steak portion of my dinner was very good, the shrimp and scallops on top of it were so so. Garlic mashed potato's were good. I asked the waiter to bring a blue moon beer out when he brought my dinner but he forgot. My wife raved about her Salmon dinner, said it was the best she's had in a restaurant in a long time. Waite staff was fairly attentive. Decor was the usual for a chain restaurant. I would go back. Our bill for the 2 dinners with no drinks was $61.62."}
{"text":"Great restaurant and service. The service here is phenomenal. The recommendation for beer was great even though I dont remember the beer. I ordered the top sirloin oscar style. It was good and cooked perfectly mid rare as I had ordered it. They give you plenty of shrimp and scallops for the oscar. The bernaise sauce was delicious and the charred bell peppers sweet. The top sirloin cut was flavorful and the price was very good for what you get. I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I am going to upgrade my review. Went for a family dinner. Thankfully they taken limited reservations on open table on Friday nights. The meal was good and our server was excellent."}
{"text":"Went here for my wife's birthday.  We were seated right away.  We were promptly brought water and bread.  Our waiter Josh was excellent.  He told the specials, explained the menu and answered any questions we had.  The manager also came around to make sure everything was going well. Also, one of the wait staff was constantly polishing all the empty glassware. My wife had the salmon which she said was very good.  I'm not a big eater so I had the prime rib sliders (3) which were also very good.  Because of the birthday we were brought the Billy M pie.  It was delicious!  It is the perfect place for a romantic dinner.  Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I'm fairly new to this area and I'm trying new places as fast as my time and budget will allow - - so when friends suggested we go to dinner at The Keg, I was thinking Sports Bar. I like a good burger and a beer (as long as it is dark), so I thought it would be a fun way to catch-up with my out-of-town friends.

The Keg turned out to be a great Steakhouse. Way better than a sports bar. The food was fantastic. (Oh, do try the twice baked potato! A winner!)
Great steaks, good salads, and veggies . . . we had asparagus and it was done perfectly! We each had the prime rib and it was melt in your mouth perfect. 

And to top it all off, our service was superb. Our server was knowledgeable, friendly, and there when we needed her and not when we didn't.  

The Keg is definitely worth a visit or two: when you have out-of-town visitors, when you need to celebrate a life event, when you are hungry for a good steak, when you need to relax over a drink and a meal  . . . . actually there are dozens of reasons to head to The Keg!"}
{"text":"The Billy Miner Pie is killer!!! 
The wedge salads were yummy; our steak was seasoned beautifully; the tuna was cooked perfectly; but still, the dessert was the star of the show! Billy Miner Pie is the business!"}
{"text":"Amazing service! All the servers are friendly and attentive to their tables and often help one another out bringing the food to tables even if they aren't their own responsibilities. The food is superb; my steak was ordered medium and I have to say it was one of the tenderest and juiciest steak I've ever had. My plate was very neat and pristine!
The server offered desert and we got the keg lime pie..absolutely delicious! I highly recommend this steakhouse, it's a little bit pricey  ($$) but definitely worth the splurge."}
{"text":"really good food and service - but, for The Love! it was freaking S-L-O-W. About 90 minutes for us to get the dinner with an 'im sorry'"}
{"text":"My husband and I have enjoyed the Keg on many occasions.  We always sit at the bar because we really enjoy the interaction of a bartender.

However, last night, we went on a date to celebrate...and something went wrong right from the beginning.  While the bartender said hello, she left us sitting there with no drink menu and no offer to get us something to drink for about five minutes.  The well was NOT slammed and there were a total of three bartenders, a bar back, and a manager behind the bar during that entire time.  I'm not usually that picky, but I felt very dismissed from the very beginning.

The bartender came back and asked if we would like something to drink and introduced herself as Katie.  She took our order and brought my husband's beer while I waited another few minutes for my glass of wine.  When she came back, she asked if we wanted appetizers.  I asked for a full menu and she went off for another five minutes, making drinks, talking with another server, and in search of menus.  

Now, I know that I have higher expectations of many places (especially restaurants that charge an average of $26 a plate) and while I understand we were there at eight pm on a Saturday night, I felt really unappreciated and unwelcome.  Our food arrived in a timely manner and it was good - not great.  I took her recommendation on the steak and was disappointed - the steak had a fat marble running through it (one thing they point out not having on the front page of their menu) and they took away hubby's lobster butter before he was finished eating.  He used the bread butter for his lobster!  I mean, come on.  For an $80 meal?

Katie really redeemed herself at the end of the night.  I mentioned that I didn't care for her particular recommendation.  She offered to replace it but I really don't like to send food back unless it is awful.  She bought our two drinks to make up for it, which earned her a 30% tip.  

I am usually so happy at the Keg...but this one merited a review of distaste."}
{"text":"Great food, great cocktails and awesome service. Our server Tim Mullen made our night. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Probably the best place to go in Chandler.  Steak, shrimp and scallops with asparagus and garlic mash.  Couldn't eat it all, had to take half home."}
{"text":"My wife and I were visiting my wife's sister and husband because they had just moved from Tucson to Gilbert. Since her husband was out of town, we decided to take her to get some dinner and had settled at The Keg. Firstly, it is a beautiful restaurant. Secondly, the staff, most notably our waiter, Albert, was very attentive and pleasant. Service at the restaurant was excellent. I had the Escargot stuffed mushrooms and it was excellent. My wife had the crab cakes as an appetizer and it too was good, though not excellent. I had the Prime Rib and thought it was very good as well. My wife and sister in law had the Chicken and I thought the chicken was VERY tender and juicy. The reason I deducted one star was because of the dessert. I ordered the Creme Brulee. The problem with it was that it was made earlier and put in a fridge. That made the sugar a little too soggy as opposed to being able to crack it with a tap of he spoon as it should have and the Creme itself was cold, so it was a little reminiscent of a really good vanilla pudding. It should have been served warm and it should have been fresh, not made ahead of time and stuck in a fridge. My wife had the chocolate cake and it was delicious. A great experience, but the Creme Brulee would have made the experience much more grand."}
{"text":"the food was amazing!!! loved the filet, it was really flavorful. also thought the double baked potato was good. prime rib was ok (honestly i was a little disappointed).

we got there pretty late so i don't know if that's why, but service wasn't the best. definitely going to be going back."}
{"text":"We went to The Keg to celebrate my Dad's 71st birthday and we are sad to say the experience was just bad. My Dad summed it up when we asked how his Prime Rib was and he uttered a choice adjective that I have never heard him say before.

I read the reviews and I wonder if we had dinner at the same place. The food was just bad.. The shrimp smelled as though it was a couple of days old and the quality of the rest of the food that came out seemed like it was better served at a truck stop than a $50/plate restaurant. The filet I had was really fatty and the mashed potatoes literally had no flavor.  When we compare The Keg to other premium Steakhouses throughout the valley, like Steak 44, there is truly no comparison in terms of the quality of the food. Our server was great, but holy cow do they need to work on their food."}
{"text":"We went to The Keg for a special occasion - a friend's anniversary!  When she made reservations she let them know it was her anniversary - when they arrived - there was a Happy Anniversary card on the table - signed by the wait staff!  It was so sweet!

Our server was on his A game for most of the service.  Very attentive for the most part - till the food came, then he kind of forgot about us.  

5 of 6 people at the table ordered Prime Rib - everyone enjoyed a well cooked and succulent slab of meat!  We all got the combo that came with salad and a side.  Great meal at a great price!  

The 6th person, odd man out, decided to get the 1/2 rack of ribs - he was disappointed.  The size of the 1/2 rack was more like a 1/4 rack of ribs - the bones after the meat was taken off looked like chicken wing bones... so sad.  We did get to express the concern to the manager - she was very apologetic and offered to fix the issue in several ways - bringing out another 1/2 rack or some prime rib... or even comp the meal.  Great work on her part.  

My advice - stick with the steak!  Prime rib is great and so is their baseball steak - had it before!  They also usually give you a piece of cake or dessert if it is a special occasion."}
{"text":"1/2/2015 my husband and I dined here while on vacation. The concierge told us it was not up to snuff but she said it with a hoity attitude that we went any way. The service was excellent. The pour for wine and liquor was great! The food.. I am sad to say.. Over cooked. Low quality food period. They are trying but music was loud and hard. Not meant for dinning more for club! Club lighting in ladies bathroom was so dark was scary!. I would pay more for better steak and veggies. Keep trying folks."}
{"text":"I first wandered into The Keg up in Vancouver, BC. it was a lazy rainy afternoon and i thought with a name like this it might be a casual beer bar to relax for a bit.... SURPRISE. Even in the afternoon it was clean, good staff, and even a simple appetizer was done right.

A couple weeks ago here in Phoenix i was looking for a nice place for dinner and having remembered they had one down the street thought i should try it. Glad i did.

It was one of those nights i thought i should try a couple different things so, loving prime rib, they had an end cut so that was the plan. Being a sucker for a good special i added the crab legs. Add in the mashed potatoes (chunky enough so you know they didn't come from a box) and veggies and it was a meal fit for a diplomat.

The one thing I always forget is that crab legs take so much time to open and eat that the meat gets cold but... that yummie warm butter. The horseradish was real and HOT and a great compliment. The prime rib had enough crust ( i hate semi-raw meat) to make it well cooked and yet not dried out and the seasoning was just right.  The service was spectacular with an actual manager making the rounds and several wait staff overseeing every detail.

It's not a cheap place but not at the top of the scale either so it won't be a weekly visit but they have some great happy hour deals and it's worth any special occasion outing.

Great good, terrific service, clean setting with professional comfortable decor. What more could you ask for. As Arnold would say... \"I'll be baaaack\" and will enjoy this  place again I'm sure."}
{"text":"Consistantly great food, service is hit and miss but always friendly.  We usually get steak dishes, always prime and cooked perfectly.  Great choice for a special night out, fireplaces for cooler weather and misters on the large patio."}
{"text":"Finally! The Keg is back in North York. Years ago there used to be a Keg at Yonge & Sheppard. This new Keg is nice & newly built. I hear it opened in early December. The decor is nice & modern. In wood tones, and royal blue. Service from the wait staff is great as usual for an Keg restaurant.

Hubby & I came for an early dinner. We had the Keg burger & it was delicious! I have a dairy allergy & the manager actually came over to warn me that the buns for the burger has a butter coating. I can handle that so I was okay with it. But it was really nice of the manager to give me that warning. There's even a second floor for the restaurant which is a smaller space. The washrooms are up there but there's an elevator for those who are mobility challenged which is very nice. 

Hubby & I would definitely come back here to try their other dishes. Baton Rouge across the street has some competition now!"}
{"text":"Once our server found out it was our first time there he explained everything in the most condescendingly didactic manner that I think he must've misunderstood and thought it was our first time in a restaurant, and then neglected to make clear important information like that they only offer one side with the meal so when I ordered mashed potatoes, the side salad was not included--nice $8 shock at the end. Who only offers one accompaniment like that? Isn't a starch and veggie pretty much the norm? Wanted to start off with some craft beers, but the most exotic on tap was Blue Moon so had to settle for some bottled beer to accompany the table bread which was nondescript--the warm yeast rolls at Golden Corral are fresher and superior by far, and if you want a steak cooked precisely to order, they do a good job too, and not for $30 for The Keg's Winter 8 oz. Sirloin, which however, was cooked to perfection, and a common baked potato.  The biggest disappointment was the $41 dried out lobster tail, but the steak beside it was fine, the garlic mashed potatoes were okay. Total bill for 3 beers, 2 meals, salad we thought was included: $106.98.  Guess we paid extra for the ambiance, but I didn't think there was much--nothing interesting architecturally or memorable art or lighting, and if there was music in the background it wasn't anything that added to the experience, but sitting by the windows to the kitchen at least allowed for a little bit of entertainment. I'd prefer a place to see beautiful scenery while eating tasty food at reasonable prices, so won't be returning here."}
{"text":"In town by myself so I sat at the bar, servers go above and beyond on the service and do the little things well to make it an enjoyable meal which to me is the difference maker.  Food is excellent as expected."}
{"text":"The Keg is a decent steakhouse.  It has bold and modern styling, and the waitstaff are dressed in sleek black attire that is striking.  

My wife and I both immediately went for the surf and turf.  What better way to enjoy an evening together at a steakhouse?

Everything was cooked to order perfectly, my wife's steak mid rare, and mine medium.  The lobster was perfectly done as well.  The simplicity of the meal was pleasant, nothing outrageous.  Meat, vegetable, potato, soup, salad, drinks.  A fine time.

We enjoyed ourselves tremendously, and appreciated that the waitress was attentive, but left us to enjoy each others' company."}
{"text":"A definite hit with our party of 9. Seven hungry minor leaguers were well fed and sent back to the field happy.  We'll hit this place again next spring training.
I looked up the other reviews first and the steaks were cooked to perfection, delivered at the same time no small feat for large groups.  Twice baked potatoes were very tasty.  The service was very attentive and helpful, even with our two Dominican players and their limited english."}
{"text":"We came to celebrate our anniversary and sat at the bar.  We ordered a couple drinks and the happy hour appetizers. The loaded nachos were really great and came as a huge portion with all the trimmings. The Neptune's mushrooms were hot and delicious and so were the baked cheesy  shrimp. We also ordered the tuna tacos, but weren't impressed that much with them. I got the strawberry fizz cocktail, which was tasty but not at all like the picture with actual berries. You would think that for $10 you could get some actual berries.  Overall it was a good meal and affordable for happy hour."}
{"text":"My wife and I frequent the KEG quite often since moving from NJ.  I can summarize our experience in six words: (a) great ambiance, (b) good food, and (c) excellent service.  We prefer to sit outside or in the bar.  The servers always make an effort to learn our name and spend time talking with us at the table.   We really enjoy this place and will continue to visit."}
{"text":"I went for Happy Hour in the bar and was very pleased.  There is a great selection of drinks and food all for very reasonable prices.  I enjoyed orange slice martinis and shared several appetizers with friends.  The food portions were large and all very tasty.  The lounge has a great  cozy atmosphere with just the right amount of lighting.  Our service was very good and they were attentive to our needs.  Just make sure you get there early because it does get crowded especially in the hot summer months when it's too warm to sit outside even with the misters."}
{"text":"Happy Valentines to my fellow foodies-

Everybody Knows not to wait until the last minute to make reservations for the most romantic holiday of the year... But did we do that?  Nope!

Instead we waited until we couldnt get in to a local Chandler steakhouse and my husband really wanted steak.

As a rule of thumb I generally try to stay away from nationwide chain restaurants so I really can only blame myself.

If you have read any of my reviews you know two things about me.

I am super picky but do not mind spending the bucks if the food warrants it

I hail from Chicago ... Used to go see the stockyards where the some of the best beef came from... Favorite Chicago steakhouse... Gene and Georgetti's

My point is I grew up with good meat and I know the difference!

We walked in mid afternoon knowing we would never get in at night without a reservation . 

Greeted by several smiling employees... We Chose to sit outside as it is a beautiful day.

Service was good ... Food? Not so much...

Although I have never been , I am guessing it is similar to  Outback Steakhouse... Generic food.

Husband and I each got the \"Manhattan cut\" I believe the price $23.00  we upgraded to get the salad ( one of the most unappealing and boring house salads ever))...

The steak which was cooked correctly! (Thank you) but truly uneventful as well.  

There was a thick piece of fat/grizzle on this small piece of meat and it took a lot of sawing with the knife to cut thu the meat ...  the seasoning was fine... Not too much... Not too little.

The double baked potatoe was ok... Just a double baked potatoe.. Nothing at all special and green beans were green beans.. No seasoning... Just beans


Oh yes... Don't want to forget to mention the bread... Small round of what I think is supposed to be sourdough... Although it was warm it was truly nothing special.

No dessert... As thus far it was clear we were spending good money on not so good/average food...no point in wasting more money.

I do want to point out the patio is a nice space with a fireplace and comfy Chairs and couches ... Perfect to unwind after shopping !

And the service was top notch... Of course the patio was not very crowded...

It is my opinion if you enjoy the chain restaurants like Outback and Red lobster and those types of places THE KEGis right up your alley!

If you are looking for a cut of real Midwest beef then you may want to go to EDDIE V's, or CHOP HOUSE or something of that nature...

We left paying the $75.00 tab knowing we would not return.

I suggest you give it a try and enjoy it for what it is!  I understand they have a decent happy hour... 

Until then.....

Bon appetite'"}
{"text":"The Keg is actually a Canadian owned small franchise that in my opinion remains one of the best steaks and overall steakhouse experience for the money (20 oz bone in ribeye $30.00) only a handful of them here in the states and several in Canada. If you happen to be in Toronto be sure to visit The Keg Mansion. It's set in this absolutely gorgeous mansion in the center of town. Anyway, this location in Phoenix didn't disappoint. I grabbed a seat that bar (my usual) had a fantastic glass of Normandy Pinot Noir and decided to go with the bone in ribeye. I ordered it med rare , Chicago style( charred outside ) mushrooms, green beans and a side of asparagus. FANTASTIC  steak ! Loaded with flavor so much didn't require any fancy sauwse or anything. Outstanding service, clean and welcoming environment in their dark wood and shiek, modern motif. I'm a big fan and will always come back ! Well down Keg Phoenix"}
{"text":"Great food & great service!!!
Modest prices & the atmosphere is low light & not too loud...
I will be back!"}
{"text":"Food and drink have always been great. Service usually is, too, but there is a bartender tonight (Alexis) who is beyond unpleasant and rude. She slammed my boyfriend's drink down without a word. She's passed patrons on to another bartender all night. Flat out rude."}
{"text":"Brain is not only attentive but makes the dining experience great. Food is absolutely amazing, very well seasoned and the timing is perfect. If you chose ever eat here, the mushroom appetizer is to die for."}
{"text":"Sorry to anyone who likes this place, but The Keg is a big, fat disappointment - just like the parties with the same name always were back in college. To be fair, we only went for happy hour, but the specialty drink we tried and the appetizer we ordered were both really gross. In my opinion, a restaurant needs to make a good impression at the bar because a lot of people, myself included, try places out by ordering a drink and appetizer or two. Given how bad what we tried was, what incentive do we have for returning for a bigger meal? 

From the outside, The Keg looks like your run-of-the-mill steakhouse; once we got inside, however, we were shocked at how sleek and upscale the decor was. The bathrooms, in particular, were gorgeous and super-clean. When we went to sit at the bar, we were expecting some really classic cocktails and satisfying appetizers. The happy hour drink special was an orange martini, so I thought I'd try it. My husband got a Heineken (1/2 off during happy hour), which can't be messed up. 

To eat, we ordered the sliders, which were $9.95; they didn't have any happy hour food specials. The martini was really sweet and tasted like it didn't have a drop of alcohol in it; it kind of reminded me of Sunny-D, which I hated growing up and now wouldn't serve to children if you paid me. The sliders were even worse. They were supposed to be prime-rib sliders, but I would have rather had ground chuck. The meat was chewy and fatty and reminded us of the sausage in an Egg McMuffin (which I like but wasn't expecting on a slider). There were also no toppings like onion or tomato - just a sauce or piece of cheese on each one. Instead of fries on the side, there were just measly little fried onions. Blech. We could have gone to Ruby Tuesday's right next door and gotten better sliders! 

In the end, we didn't spend more than $22 or so, but being a happy hour fanatic, I know that there are plenty of other places (Latitude 30 is a notable example) where we could go and spend the same amount and get some great appetizers and drinks. We definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"My daughter and I were here recently to treat ourselves to a sunset patio indulgence dinner on a warm summer evening. I confess I adore eating al fresco when the weather is right & love watching the sun go down as I sip my last drink and maybe have dessert. My daughter loves to do this too. If we have nachos or French fries we will sneak one of the tortilla chips or a fry to a nearby hungry grateful sparrow on the patio. (Yes, we are both shameless birdnerds) 

My husband hates the sun in his eyes so he's strictly an indoor eater, but he wasn't here on this trip. It was just we 2 girls, mother and daughter, eating out and feeling deliciously naughty to splurge on a steak and lobster dinner. I love steak but I love lobster even more and I will NEVER pass up lobster if I can have it, do you understand, NEVER!

So here we were at the Keg, the traditional steakhouse for a night out with all the trimmings. There was a summer special of a steak with a half lobster that this seafood goddess, ME, was not gonna resist. Since the lobster was sliced in half vertically, it was mostly easy to pry out the juicy melt in your mouth lobster meat. Notice I said, mostly. For you see, that half lobster had one claw and the claw was a fair size. If the claw is a good size, it's well worth prying out the equally good meat of the lobster claw, even if you need a little lobster fork and a lobster cracker to get that claw open. 

Unfortunately no cracker or lobster fork had been supplied with the dinner. The waitresses were busy going back and forth and forgot my request for these items several times. They also seemed confused why I needed the lobster \"safecracking\" equipment in the first place. Hadn't the lobster already been sliced in half for me? Why did I need special itty bitty fork + cracker then?

When I finally got tiny fork + cracker, all wrapped with a napkin with a Keg style flourish, I found I couldn't crack that titanium lobster claw to save my life. Sometimes that does happen. So you got no choice but to ask the restaurant's kitchen to crack the crustacean for you. 

Which, of course, I did. Getting that communicated, that I wanted THEM to crack it, took forever and they seemed to get just more confused. Maybe the Keg doesn't like to do this service and thinks the customer should have sufficient arm strength to do their own cracking. Even a woman who still loves lobster but now, alas, has arthritis in her hands ;_;

So the wait staff kept bringing me dear little fancy napkins with itty bitty lobster fork and lobster cracker inside when I already had two of those *face palms*. The message that I wanted the KITCHEN to crack the lobster claw for me was obviously getting garbled.

I finally got them to understand what was wanted and finally got a cracked lobster claw brought to me, which I enjoyed with gusto. But easily in all the outdoor to and fro confusion, my dinner could have gotten stone cold and I could have felt frustrated.

I didn't though. The dinner was just too good, the atmosphere in the shaded umbrella table too serene, the rosy sunset too spectacular, the waitress and all the other staff too friendly, cheerful and wanting to please, it made me so mellow, way too contented and mellow to mind the wait. Instead, I found the parade of seafood equipment napkins brought to me with such an expectant well-meaning flourish each time to be comical.

It finally dawned on me that none of the Keg wait staff had ever eaten the claw of a lobster before. They didn't even know it was edible! They thought only the lobster tail was for eating!! They must have thought the only purpose of a lobster claw was as a pinchy decoration which could be dealt with by a rubber band to keep the live lobster in check till it met its fate.

The aftermath: I didn't have the heart to complain at the time. You can't help what you don't know about and don't get me wrong, I loved my steak lobster dinner, and my daughter is still raving about hers weeks and weeks later. She wishes we could afford a Keg indulgence more often.

But I did send an online satisfaction survey to the manager, in which I suggested he train all his staff on just how edible and delicious a lobster claw can be. I begged him not to scold his waitress, who was really doing the best she could for us all evening. He was really nice too, thanked me for the feedback--and gave me a $50 gift certificate for the Keg as thanks! So my daughter got her wish, and we got another Keg feast at a substantial discount!

I am left with just one problem if you can call it that. I just finished the warmed up leftovers from our second Keg feast: garlic red skin mashed potatoes, sautéed mushrooms, green beans, red peppers, all still succulent days later. What about the steak? Are you kidding? This carnivore finished that off long ago!

Yeah, you guessed my problem. I wanna go back to the Keg again as badly as my daughter does! LOL!"}
{"text":"This is the place for a last minute happy hour, it's open seating at the bar.  The deals on appetizers and drinks are worth it, and the servers are very friendly.  If you want to have dinner here, especially Fri through Sun, you need a reservation if you want to eat before 8:00pm.  The average wait is 1.5 hours for dinner.  For dessert, don't miss the Billy Miner Pie, it is delicious.  The bar selection is extensive.  For steaks, it is excellent whether you choose Prime Rib, Filet, Sirloin, or any other cut.  I have never had to send it back, it's always made the way you ask for."}
{"text":"I have been to The Keg many times before, but this was the first time at this location.  I had a birthday coupon to use and it was just as great as the other locations.  I had the prime rib, which is always a perfect flavor.  For dessert, I shared a Billy Miner Pie with my parents.  It's a large coffee ice cream cake slice drizzled with chocolate and caramel sauce topped with shaved almonds and a chocolate graham crust.  Yeah, I think you can see why this place is more than just a great place for steaks and cocktails.  Not to mention the excellent customer service.  I highly recommend this place for that quality steak dinner that you've been craving!"}
{"text":"5 stars every time and I'm a regular! Me and fiancé love this place and have had many many date nights here. They have an amazing menu!! Grass fed beef that is from
Canada and never frozen. Amazing drink menu - I love the Miami Haze. We get shrimp cocktail almost every time for our appetizer - it's delicious! I favor the bacon wrapped tenderloin with a blue cheese and garlic crumble on top. My fiancé loves to get the rib steak, he loves the flavor profile! We also love the desert menu, they have a couple desserts that we frequently get, one is a mocha ice cream pie to die for! The other is a delicious decadent brownie with ice cream and home made whipped cream on top. I can't say enough great things about this place! We also love that it's right in the Santan Mall and Best Buy - perfect for walking off our meal while shopping!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, good ambience, good service. Good choice of steaks, chicken and wines"}
{"text":"If your looking for a more casual steak house. Than this place has it for you. Gosh, I want another steak and twice baked potato from this place. 

Service was excellent.  The restaurant should be relocated to Scottsdale where it belongs."}
{"text":"Just a pleasant, relaxed time. The atmosphere is friendly though a little scattered at times. The food is solid and the drinks are reasonably priced."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here one Friday night for dinner and weren't  a bit surprised to find it packed inside.  Every restaurant near the Chandler Mall is usually packed!  There's not much else to do in Chandler...ouch!  I know.

We were quite surprised at how good the food was.   Let me back up for a moment and say that they have a really good wine selection...I was impressed.  I can't remember what I had, but I remember being impressed!

I had their wedge salad and my husband had the Caesar...both excellent.  My husband had the sirloin Oscar for dinner and they had a salmon Oscar that night that I had....can I say how RICH that dish was!?  The topping is seafood and Bearnaise sauce.  Sooo good.  We couldn't comment on dessert because we couldn't fit it in.

Happily surprised.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"The best steaks in town. Also great dessert. The lobster tail with the steak is my go to. I try to come at least twice a month. If you're in town, you have to stop here to have a good steak."}
{"text":"I'm not a steak and potato person but I do enjoy and nice steak now and then.  I recently dined here to celebrate a graduation.  The venue was the father's choice and not the graduate.   This restaurant dims their lights for \"ambiance\" but I felt it was little too low because I had trouble reading the menu and always wonders what are they hiding???.  

Started off with a cocktail-Ginger Peach Tea--delicious!  Their sourdough table bread is very tasty.

I order the 6oz top sirloin (medium) with asparagus.  I had high hopes because the cocktail was delicious.  It came with roasted red bell peppers and greens beans and no other sauce...  I was a bit confused and didn't know there was an option to add a sauce (extra charge) to it--as I mentioned before a bit too dim to read the menu.

While the steak was cooked to a perfect medium, salt and pepper was a bit lacking on it.  The asparagus and green beans literally looked like they were boiled-- no spices that I could taste.   The roasted peppers tasted.....roasted.  I wanted to ask for butter and garlic and onion powder for the veggies.... 

The 3 stars is for the cocktail, the bread and the service-not so much the main course. They could've made a better attempt to make the green beans and asparagus a bit more appetizing."}
{"text":"Wow what a night our server Matt was one of the most attentive servers I have ever had and me and my girlfriend will definitely be going back again even if it's just for his exceptional service in itself. The food www amazing as well but the warmth and feeling at home feeling that Matt gave us can't be matched it was a perfect evening out and much appreciated great job! Definitely ask for Matt when making a reservation you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Far better quality food than at Chop. Steaks were cooked perfectly, tuna tartare was amazing and desserts were delicious! Wine menu was also a bonus. The tuna tacos were good - have a little kick to them. My only complaint is the Caesar - surprised they didn't have anchovies and all five salads were overdressed.

Our boys had to order, eat and dash for a hockey meeting in less than 30 mins and our waitress amazingly accomplished it with a table of 9."}
{"text":"Hmm with all the hype I'm lost. I ordered the prime rib. It was OK really fatty but not bad. The twice baked potato ewe was too much salt probably because they are not fresh made.  Also got the scallops and shrimp. Eh nothing special I've had much better. I have never gone out to eat and still been hungry after. I ordered the cheesecake for dessert. It was good. No complaints but it's comparable to any store bought one. Husband got sirloin steak he liked it but didn't care for the veggies he said they looked freezer burned. He also got the lobster tail. Nothing worse than crispy lobster.  He did enjoy his brownie dessert. But the entree did not fill him up either. For the money you can go somewhere that serves better food. Sorry for the bad review but step it up a notch you're a high dollar place so please cook and serve accordingly. No frozen foods please."}
{"text":"yummm!  second time i've been to the keg and enjoyed both times.  this time i ordered the king crab legs and i wasn't disappointed.   would go back."}
{"text":"Amazing!  $$$$ food on $$ prices.  Great ambiance at amazing prices.  See you next time I'm in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I picked up my partner at Sky Harbor and we were both hungry, but for something light since it was already after 8 PM. We hadn't been to Tempe Marketplace yet and thought why not give something new a try. And for me it's always another chance to review a new try on yelp.com. So this is how we wound up at The Keg Steakhouse.

It wasn't too busy on a Tuesday evening so we were offered three seating choices: lounge, outside patio or the dining room. We chose the lounge since we wanted to be casual and the Cubs were playing the Diamondbacks.

We both ordered basically the same thing Chicken Strips his with Ceasar Salad, mine with Fries. (Too bad it didn't come with a toy!) The only issue we had was both coming out with salads instead of mine with fries. Okay I could have eaten the salad, god knows I could stand to lose few lbs., but heck I REALLY wanted fries and had to send it back. Our server came back with the fries in a few minutes and apologized profusely saying that it was her mistake. Hey, we've all made mistakes, right? And it wasn't the end of the world I got my fries.

So the moral of the story is I would have given them five stars had the order been right. They probably deserve 4 1/2 stars, but I can't do that on yelp.

Give The Keg a try when you're at Tempe Marketplace!"}
{"text":"Went there after the movie  on a Friday night. This was part of a group and they actually let us reserve the entire patio! What a concept someone who wanted to work with a group of folks.

The food was amazing. The bacon wrapped scallops were awesome, the chicken wings excellent with a little kick, the batter idami yummy...the pizza also very good. The drinks were very generous in portions, you got to mix your own. They brought a glass of Crown and ice each time, I got add how much Pepsi to add. Saw that with others....so if you ended up thinking \"straight up\" there was that option. 

The servers were plentiful, and the drinks came quickly. I wandered inside at one point to watch the end of the hockey game and observed the bartender and how it was all run. What an art form, these folks were moving but at no time was there a hiccup, and the food that passed by us from the kitchen area was also amazing. 

I will be coming back here and would highly recommend this place to any group where you want to just sit back an relax and be pampered...and leave with a tummy full of yummy."}
{"text":"Always a pleasure eating here. I've eaten at other Keg restaurants before, but I find this one to be one of the best. And the experience I had last week was one of the most greatest experiences I have ever had at an restaurant. At this restaurant chain, the food is on point, the service is amazing and you really feel treated like royalty. 

I went last week to this location for my dad's b-day party. They were super accommodating as my brother was very ill, they took care of him better than my mom did lolz, including getting him tea, warm bread and finding extra pillows for him to lay back on. And they would come by the table every 15 mins to check on him. Also, my dad has celiac disease which means he cant have gluten, they were super helpful in showing him choices on the menu that he could have. Including choices for my mom because she is allergic to alcohol, and needed meat cooked without. They even took special cooking instructions for my grandmother that can't eat hard veggies, and changed the way the sauce was made to her liking. The server was so polite and made jokes to make our night the best. Overall, always a fantastic experience here. I would def recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I got the rib steak, tasty and tender, ambience was nice, service was right on ,a few tweeks here and there and it would have been five stars like ,nothing really to drink for someone who does not drink alcohol and it's way to dark  ,but I've been going to the keg for years and I do really enjoy the place"}
{"text":"A non-red meat eater walked into The Keg....that's how my story starts!  I am not known for making trips to a steakhouses but I have to say I like this place.  The staff are super friendly and are eager in helping you make a selection of drinks or food.  I highly recommend the Strawberry Lemonade!  Supposedly there's Gin in this drink but I did not taste a drop!  I tried the Teriyaki Chicken with a yummy pineapple cilantro salsa!  I chose the Twice Bake Potato as my side....omg there's bacon it!  This was amazing and I need the recipe!  They don't have a bad happy hour menu.  I won't change my non-red meat eating ways but I will continue to visit the Keg.  


*Side note: Yes I eat bacon.  I don't eat Red Meat by choice and not for a cause."}
{"text":"Diverse food and drunk menu here. Steaks are prepared well as well as other food items. I prefer my steak medium rare. Great service from the wait staff."}
{"text":"This place is so cool the environment is perfect for a lovely dinner. The food was amazing and the customer service alone was seriously on it. We loved it. It's great for large dinner groups and patio seating is so nice too."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere in this place. Had a huge booth overlooking the bar. Had the prime rib, and was happy with it. Good place, a little pricey, but you already knew that."}
{"text":"This place is the spot for Happy Hour 4-6 pm.  They have several drink specials, I didn't listen after I saw the juicers at the bar and heard \"orange slice martini\" (3.75).  This drink is perfect, the orange slice floater tops it off- yum.  Next I tried a greyhound - of course fresh squeezed grapefruit and I added  the extra shot of Grey Goose for 1.25.   All appetizers are half off, you have to do the prime rib (no joke) sliders for about a fin.  WOW, this going to be a once a week gig methinks!  Not overcrowded, great lighting, comfortable and great service.  Give it a shot.  Oh, and the complimentary party of 6 or more Nachos were a hit."}
{"text":"Just ate at The Keg on Tatum. Our daughter gave us a gift card as she heard that The Keg is a great place to eat in Arizona. She was told correctly. Our meal was outstanding and our server Michael did a great job. Look forward to going back there next year when we come back for the winter."}
{"text":"Looks nice and upscale but the food is beyond awful. I have been to other locations and the food was nothing to rave about but the service was ok at this location the service was even worse than the food. I will never ever ever ever go back. The veggies were cooked to the point of mush... the filet was over cooked and just a terrible cut of filet... I was waiting for someone to come out and tell us we just had walmart steaks.. save your money.. eat local fuck chains."}
{"text":"I Love the 1 star reviews--Comedy! \"My NY Steak was less than 1/2\" thick..\"(doubt it) or \"I had to park ONE HUNDRED yards away...\" (exercise) or \"our table was so BIG!...\" (I hate elbow room, so I will complain and go back to waiting for a smaller table)
Our visit was great, also $25 off for your birthday is AMAZING! My wife's birthday was 2 days before mine so our server brought us a huge piece of Kona ice cream cake for her. Hope you can filter though the dum-dum reviews, this is a nice place Our 10 oz Filet was cooked to perfection and the King Crab was great. Order the crab cakes, split the dinner meal (with salad/grilled veggies/mashed potatoes), and enjoy your date night. 
PS, the Blueberry Mule cocktail is addicting."}
{"text":"I have nothing bad to day about this place. The service was very prompt and they made sure my glass was always full. The food was great I had the prime rib and it was amazing.  The wine selection by the glass was limiting the calamari and carpaccio was amazing.  
The salad was good.  Some of the clientele was a bit snooty but well cheap entertainment. There were lots of little kids in the place. Some of them were terable anf crying.  Leave your crying kids at home or take em to chucky cheese"}
{"text":"Great for special occasions and out of town guests. Service has been stellar every time we have visited this location. Prime rib is always good... LOVE the horseradish!!! Also, best key lime pie I've ever had. Ever."}
{"text":"Top notch food,  service and atmosphere.  A little on the high end for price,  but food lives up to billing."}
{"text":"Great food, great service and great atmosphere. The Rib Steak and shrimp was delicious and cooked just right.  I've eaten here a handful of times and have nothing short of excellence with the different items on the menu. Be sure to sign up for their birthday program to get a buy one get one free towards a meal every year."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places! They have a garlic cheese bread that is so delicious it makes my eyes roll to the back of my head. I have fallen in love with their peppercorn steak. So tasty! Excellent service everytime we have gone, though they occasionally have trouble meeting my \"well done\" request but always make sure I leave satisfied. You can sign up for their email club and they send you a certificate good for a free prime rib dinner. Great place for a celebration dinner, date or just a night out."}
{"text":"We sat at a table for over two and a half hours with a toddler on a Sunday night. They were out of all 6 oz. Steaks I believe. (Size) We to a friend there for his birthday and wished we had gone to Durant's. When they brought the meals, my steak was under cooked and lobster was dry and over cooked. My husband's steak was way overdone. All the manager offered to do was to give us a free dessert!  I haven't had the best experiences here in the past. It is worth it to go to another venue that is not a chain."}
{"text":"My first time here for my hubby's birthday dinner. 3 stars at best. Service was ok, a little on the slow side. Food was mediocre. Steaks ok though a bit pricey. Do not order the Brussels sprouts under any circumstances--really flavorless. I don't see us returning."}
{"text":"Amazing place! Service is fantastic, food is delicious and consistent and atmosphere is relaxing."}
{"text":"Food was quite good and the atmosphere was enjoyable.  Steakhouse pricing, clearly.  I would go back here for a company dinner, but probably wouldn't visit often with my family."}
{"text":"Beautiful place; was my \"go to\" after shopping but not anymore. Two bad experiences in a row - one because of a manager, and the last because of a server. Too bad, but there are other options."}
{"text":"Just left the restaurant. I was a little reluctant after reading a few of the reviews. Glad we went. Celebrating our anniversary. Kids flew in from East coast to surprise us! Their treat!! Dylan was our server. Pleasant and not over the top. Carlos, the manager introduced himself. We were given a Happy Anniversary card as soon as we were seated. What a nice touch. Ordered 4 of the appetizers. Enjoyed most of them. Nothing due to quality, just preference. Now the dinner: 3 of us ordered steaks, and one steak salad. All of us agreed that dinner was DELISH! Steaks cooked exactly as requested. Seasoned perfectly. I picked Asiago rice as my side, even though I assumed it would just be ok. I was wrong. That rice was so tasty. I couldn't decide if I liked the steak or the rice best. Everyone polished their dishes! We didn't plan on dessert, but glad we did that too. Brownie sundaes, carrot cake, and creme brûlée. To top the evening, we were surprised with complementary champagne. How lovely.  Great night. YUMMY!
I'm not sure what would make it a 5...but it's close!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food service was crap we were surprised especially for the Keg our waitress Jessica I believe her name was kept us waiting just to get the bill it's like she forgot about us.and then another waitress who was really nice took care of us..not impressed"}
{"text":"Always exceptional service and food. The Caesar salad is great, and the New York steak is always a winner. It can get a little loud, but that all depends on the crowd that is there -- small, intimate booths are available, but there is a fairly large open area as well.  As for the bar, the drinks are poured string and there is a large selection of house drinks and wines. They treat kids very well, but this isn't the place to go for a $5 kids meal."}
{"text":"We've been here multiple times and the food and service are always excellent!! One is our favorite places to go!"}
{"text":"You sign up a few years ago for their birthday club where they offer you a free meal/ steak and you did not get the email. You call the restaurant and they confirm you are in the system but it is not up to them to send you the email to get the free Birthday dinner. And the staff just shrugged their shoulders and said and I quote \" so it's your Birthday so what\" did not care to try make our special day to eat at their establishment. Way to ruin the weekend Keg."}
{"text":"AMAZING. I went here for newyears. The food portions are huge and delicious. I got the best waitress ever and gave her a great tip of $30.00 for her great serive. She kept comong back to make sure everything was fine. She packed my dessert because i couldnt finish it. She also packed the wine i ordered."}
{"text":"Solid steak! All the setup of a fancy steak house but with out the over the top prices of one. Very reasonable for the meal you get especially if you price out other places in the area. Made a reservation 45 minutes before I left to visit and table was ready upon arrival. Fresh hot bread round from the oven was still steaming and ohhhhh sooooo good. Just watch out for the horseradish because it is HOT! Not like regular but like holy hell my nose is clear now. If you're in the area give it a try. It's a little dark in there so just beware if that's not your thing, but I don't need lighting to know a good steak."}
{"text":"Went to this location last night to celebrate Mothers day. I was so impressed by EVERY staff member and how polite and professional they all were. We interacted with the hostesses, bartenders, our server, and a manager and every single one of them was truly awesome. 
Great food, great wine, and great dessert. Will definitely come back when we want a nice steak place!"}
{"text":"Pricey, but that is what you get for good food at a classy establishment. Good for happy hour specials."}
{"text":"Went her on Friday night, and the service was awesome.. got a table easily, even though it seemed pretty full. Ordered ribs and chicken, and it was cooked to perfection.. Perfect meal !! Substituted fried with double baked potato, and didn't regret at all !"}
{"text":"Phenomenal food, exceptionally good service and a nice relaxing sophisticated atmosphere. Took my husband here for his 38th birthday dinner, and we had such a lovely experience. Our server (Steven) was probably one of the best servers that we have ever had - his expertise, customer service and promptness were all top notch - so much so that I even complimented his manager! This place is truly awesome - literally can not recommend it enough!!!"}
{"text":"Looking for a great Steakhouse & Bar in the Phoenix area? Look no further than The Keg. 

Great atmosphere, a heated patio for those evening dinners, great service, and phenomenal steaks."}
{"text":"I had dinner last night with my friend from Alaska who was here for a hip replacement. We ordered Calamari and Prime Rib dinner. I asked to sample their lobster bisque and we both ordered a drink. I told my waitress I had allergies and would like to know how they made their lemon drop while I ordered. I asked her to leave out an ingredient. Now I'm not sure where things went wrong. About a third into my prime rib I felt nauseous, hot and dizzy. I went to the ladies room and things got worse. I vomited 4 times spending most of my time in a stall. I thought I should go get my friend who since her recent surgery could not walk far. I left the bathroom, walking thru the bar and slipped, fell and bumped my knee and arm. Now I was still not feeling well and on the floor, embarrassed and nauseous. No I wasn't drunk since I couldn't finish my one drink! Some very nice people helped me up and went to get my friend. Now I know it had to be something I ate or drank because my stomachache was in knots! The Manager came to see me in the bathroom and offered water, had her notepad and questioned me. I wasn't in the position to answer but I'm sure it was liability concerns. She came back after the fall and began her questioning again. She said that the drink mix had sulfites and so do most of the spices they use including the au jus. I think it was that or the food was bad. Fortunately I had some Benadryl with me so that helped. I had a terrible time and had to take medication and was up throughout the night getting sick. In the morning my friend said her stomach was bothering her all night and she couldn't sleep as well. Finally fell asleep at 4am. That very expensive dinner we paid for was not worth it's cost. Needless to say, today I won't be eating much. Also may never visit this location again."}
{"text":"The food and service was exceptional. Jenny was our server and made our first experience at the keg an unforgettable one! Cant wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Took an hour from order to food at table. The worst part was my $35 steak was over cooked, asked for medium rare got well done. Although The flavor was excellent. They gave us free round of drinks and took the steak off the bill. Nice service."}
{"text":"Why would anyone conclude a perfect 5 star dinner experience by annoying the customer at the last moment?

I almost never frequent The Keg when I'm paying, but I couldn't resist when they emailed me a free entree birthday certificate, so I carefully planned out what my date and I would be ordering to estimate costs, settling on the Bleu Cheese Filet for $34.

It sounded amazing... a filet mignon wrapped in pepper bacon and grilled to your liking, covered in a bleu cheese crust, served golden brown and sprinkled with roasted garlic cloves.  YES PLEASE!

In hindsight, I realized what happened when I placed my order.  The waiter confirmed my order back to me, but he said \"a bacon wrapped filet classic with bleu cheese crust, sauteed mushrooms and twice baked potato\"

I assumed that he had just repeated my order back to me, but he really confirmed several upgrades, such as a larger $44 steak with sauteed mushrooms and a $2/per crust.

I assumed I was just going to pay $34 + tax for one of the entrees, but I was charged $46 + tax.  Its not that much more, but it was more than I had expected to pay... so I was visibly annoyed.

But rather than being a `Yelp Mafia Douche`, I considered how my date and I raved about the meal, and agreed it was definitely worth the extra coinage and this 5 star review.

See you next year, Keg"}
{"text":"The Keg is a great place to go and spend a special evening with someone. I've dined there almost a dozen times, and even after trying a few more well known or more expensive steakhouses, I continue to go to The Keg. I first went to The Keg when they opened Tempe Marketplace with my boyfriend on one of our vey first dates. It's very modern and dimly lit, which I love. I always request a booth so I've never had a problem with seating or being stuck in a loud section of the restaurant. My experiences have always been quiet with light background music, perfect for conversation. Because it was our first visit to the restaurant, the manager sent over a complimentary shrimp cocktail. Which was actually really awesome because we both love shrimp cocktail. The Kegs shrimp cocktail comes with nice big shrimp, displayed beautifully in a martini glass. And we have ordered it every time since.  We normally get a bottle of wine, The Keg has a good standard selection with fair prices, taking into account that you are paying for presentation and atmosphere. I'm a stickler for wine presentation so I love that for the most part, all of the servers I've had at The Keg know what they're doing. The dinner menu is simple, which is nice. I hate cluttered menus. I always get the Petite Filet Mignon, which is wrapped in bacon. I'll send a steak back if it's not done the way I asked and i've never sent anything back while dining at The Keg. The service has always been excellent. All the servers are friendly and know the menu well. I've never had a bad experience. Actually, I normally have really great experiences where I save the servers name so I can request them another time. All in all I would definitely recommend The Keg to anyone who would like to enjoy a wonderful evening of good wine and great steaks in a modern atmosphere right here in Tempe."}
{"text":"This place is delicious but very expensive! Luckily my dad was paying so I thoroughly enjoyed prime rib with a baked potato, grilled vegetables, and some pretty damn strong horseradish. It is very fancy here so cloth napkins all around. On a Friday night, plan to wait nearly an hour if you don't have reservations. Very loud but extremely good service and overall a good place to go for good meat."}
{"text":"Best value in town. You can always get a nice steak with a lobster tail here for around $35. That's a good deal!

Try the twice baked potato and order any steak except for the Prime Rib."}
{"text":"The food was PHENOMENAL. All 4 of us ordered different cuts of steak and loved them. I've been to some very nice steakhouses and my ribeye was up there! Very reasonably priced all things considered. Will be returning!"}
{"text":"This place Knocked it Out of the Ballpark !!  THANK YOU !

I walked in the door and was greeted by a very professional and seasoned hostess.  I was given an option of the dining room or lounge which ironically is why I was at their restaurant.  I was not offered such in one of their competitors restaurants just shortly before.  I'm glad I decided to walk out of that place and come to The Keg.

The food was phenomenal and the service even better!  I had the Prime Rib.  Everything from the Wedge salad, dinner bread, entree and sides were nothing short of awesome!  

The service was so incredible that I tipped the server 50% of the check.

Thank you The Keg ... I'll be back soon !"}
{"text":"Definitely a prime destination for a great meal.  You can create your own favorite dinning experience.  Experiment with the menu.  Try it!   You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went there for Thanksgiving lunch. Service was excellent, server was attentive. Food was very good.  Had 3 issues. First, it took quite some time to get our food. I'll attribute that to the holiday. The second was the value didn't seem to be high enough. Would have liked either better quality food for the price. Third, my son's sliders came out cold. That issue was resolved quickly and the manager apologized for the issue. We will go back in the future."}
{"text":"I am traveling from Oregon, USA and was told this place had the best prime rib in Canada. That person must be correct because it may have been one of the best I've ever had. Glad I ate here."}
{"text":"Overpriced for sure.  Sloppy presentation of dishes. Looked like grandma serving a family style meal.  Cajun chicken was shameful.  They advertise a free bday cake but charge for it. Waiter delivered bill with desert.  Lacks class. The one good thing about toronto is its abundance of great restaurants. Stay away from chain.  You can find better."}
{"text":"Addition:  Tonight, my friend went to enjoy her leftovers from last night dinner and found the most disgusting mush mash of crap in her box.  The server must have tossed it all in the box with his hands?  No care in somebody's meal and the price paid?  Was it enough we were double billed for a crappy steak and now, its thrown in a box?  Literally, the food was thrown in the box and you can see the fingerprint in the baked potato.  

Again, Nick at The Keg by Chandler Mall.... maybe this isn't the career for you.  You truly have no respect for others.  I regret now the 12% gratuity I did leave you."}
{"text":"Came back again while down for Spring Training. Another phenomenal meal. Had the best time. Food was great, restaurant was elegant, and our waitress Kyl was awesome. My wife and I will definitely be back again next year. 
P.S. - Give Kyl a raise, she was superb."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to have dinner!  Love sitting out side in the winter with the fireplace and in the summer with the misters.  The food is always excellent.  We always take our out of town guest here. You can talk, drink and eat, Fun."}
{"text":"Went here once a while back and remember it was quite nice. Not too loud which is good. The food was really food and the portions were big so sharing food might be a good idea at times! The service is not the greatest though, which is why I took a star off."}
{"text":"Rarely do I write a review right after my experience. Mostly because I need some time to process negatives and positives. But this case is simple, so...
I ordered the top sirloin, medium rare. On the side I wanted mashed potatoes, sautéed mushrooms, raw bell peppers, cucumbers, tomatoes, and raw onion circles. Got mashed potatoes with green onions inside it, cooked green peas and sweet peppers. And a plate of roasted onions. Order customization failed. The steak was well done (may be I should've gone for rare?) so I didn't enjoy it either. Wait time is above normal, I'd say. They don't have Pumpernickel, they don't know what it is. The interior is ... okay. Comparing to the finest Chicago steak houses I've been to this place is 2.5 stars, but not 3. So it's 2."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly fast service. Far better than any of the Hotel restaurants you maybe staying at by the airport. Kevin is a fantastic waiter!  High quality food and a vast menu selection."}
{"text":"We love our steakhouses, and The Keg is one that is at the top of our list !! If your in the Chandler area stop by and meet Spencer and the crew. They are THE BEST !! From the tuna tartare appetizer to the filet and shrimp to the billy miner pie All we can say is WOW !!! Great food and exceptional service"}
{"text":"Our female party of 6 (4 adults, 13yr & 6 yr old) met at the Keg in Gilbert for a special night out.   We met around 815p on a Saturday and enjoyed a glass of wine while waiting for a table.   The service in the bar/waiting area was great.  The transition from bar tab to table was customer friendly, unlike many establishments where you have to pay the bar tab separately from the dining tab.   In my opinion, the service was the best part of our evening.  The food was fantastic, but what really differentiated this restaurant from competitors was the service.  Our waiter ensured everyone in our group was comfortable, including the kids.   When we requested our checks be divided, he didn't hesitate to accomodate.  I'm usually underwhelmed and/or turned off by the standard franchise gimmick but it didn't feel like that tonight.  I was impressed."}
{"text":"I took my fiance to The Keg. I have to say that it exceeded all my expectations. The service was great, they treated us like we were people instead of a number. The environment was amazing, the lighting, music choice, and seating is what made it that way. Now the food, of course, was amazing. I had the 'Keg Sized' Prime Rib and it was delicious. The garlic mashed potatoes tasted superb as well. My fiance and I had a few Martinis as well. She had the Chocolate Martini and Kiwi Martini which she enjoyed. I had the Water Martini which was fabulous. Overall this place is a great experience. It's casual and intimate at the same time. The cost is about the same you'd spend at a Claim Jumper or any other Steakhouse. I highly recommend The Keg, I know I'll be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Friday, we came just before the lunch rush but there's more than enough space for anyone. The decor is amazing and perfect for a nice business meeting spot or for a special event. It's been a while since I've been to The Keg and the service was exceptional. Our waitress was wonderful and took the time to give us recommendations. 

Was craving a good piece of meat so I got the 8oz top sirloin, medium rare. The steak came to my table perfectly grilled and tasted delicious. The bread that we had before our meals was also nice and heated, which I love.

Had no complaints at all and would love to come back."}
{"text":"I always judge a restaurant on service first and food second. The service here is one of the very best. I've had some issues with my steak and the manager always is apologetic and compensates. Even though the food can be hit and miss it's the friendly great service that keeps me coming back. If it was just rated on food I'd give it three stars but the service is five stars so it averages to four stars."}
{"text":"First of all, if I could give this place zero starts I would. It's not because it wasn't a nice restaurant because the inside was very nice. It's purely because of terrible customer services that was displayed there to me and my friend. I'll explain...

Yesterday 8/30/17 evening around 6:30 pm my friend and I went to this restaurant based off a recommendation from a colleagues. As we walk in, there were two hostess standing up  front.  They greeted us very nicely at first. We were given the option to go to the bar area where there was opening seating or the dinning area. We requested the dinning area. The hostess said it would be about a 15-20 min wait. My friend and I were ok with the wait as we were anticipating the food here. We take our number and sit down and waited. 

During our time there were other customers coming in who mentioned they had reservations  and they were taken to the back. But then a family comes in of about 6 people. They are standing in front of my friend and l so clearly we can hear their convo. I over heard them talking about how they didn't have reservations and they wonder how long the wait was going to be. At this point my friend and I have already been waiting 15 mins. That same family was greeted by a server who came out from the dinning hall. The server then began to give each person a hug and a Kiss.  A gentleman a part of this group said \" how long is the wait \" the sever clearly states \" I have one more table. Once they leave I will hook you guys up, I will bring you back.\" So at this point my friend and I look at each other  and was thinking I hope they don't bring this party of 6 back before our party of 2. We heard them clearly state they didn't have reservation and and the server said he would hook them up. Also thought how unprofessional it If for a server to have this convo in the entrance of the restaurant where others can hear. 

At this point it's been. 25 mins my friend and I have been  waiting. The party of 6 goes to the bar all of ten mins or less and the hostess who originally told us it would be 15-20 Waite took that party of six back the dinning area. As she was taking them back she looked back at us and quickly turned her head away. 

Now we are going on 30 -35 mins. I get up to front desk and ask them how long the wait was she said another 4 more mins. I said \"ok no worries, we see other parties come up up before us so I was just wondering.\"  She said \" ohh ok they all had reservations. At this point she has lied to my face because my friend and I clearly heard the family state they didn't have any reservations. So some had reservations not ALL. 

We agreed that If they don't get to us in 5-10
Minutes we will leave. Another 10 min went by and we still didn't get called. We decided it was time to go. I went up to gave my number back and the hostess was like \"
There is open seating up here.\" I stated to them nicely \" no thank you we see other getting seated before us with no reservations and we have been waiting 45 mins.\" The hostess grabbed my number from me,  rolled her eyes at me and looked away. RUDE!! 

What they didn't know is my friend and I were testing the restaurant out to see if it would be a great fit to house and high end company dinner. We picked the dinning area on purpose because we wanted to see if this place would be a perfect fit. However due to the poor customer service, the unprofessionalism of the employees and the rudeness of the hostess we will NOT be taking our business there. They lost out on a lot of money that could have been spent there. We will be taking our business else where."}
{"text":"I had the onion soup and the Pecan Sirloin, but since they cook with wine, and I really hate wine, my steak was ruin, but it was my fault I should had mention I dont like, wine."}
{"text":"Experienced The Keg for my first time last week - all I can say is WOW! The food was excellent, the service superb, and the company even better. We both had the prime rib and it was perfect. I tried the orange martini and it was so good - normally I don't like fancy drinks - a filthy martini is more my style but the orange martini was wonderful."}
{"text":"My friend & I went here for my birthday dinner and it was SO good! It was a busy Friday evening and we were seated in a high traffic area but the hostess was kind enough to move us to the next available table. The food was seriously the BEST I have had in a very long time! I ordered Chicago style sirloin & lobster and the steak was cooked perfectly! Seared on the outside, well done inside but still tender. The lobster was the best tasting that I have had in Arizona!"}
{"text":"I am a repeat customer at the Keg. Their service is great throughout the chains which speaks volumes to their care and integrity to the brand. Our server was prompt with the greet, getting our orders, refills and checking in with the table. My parents are quite picky and they even commented that the service was great! We ordered the top sirloin with their infamous twice baked potato and veggies. As an appetizer, we ordered the mushroom neptunes. YUM! The steaks were juicy and cooked to perfection for medium rare. The twice baked loaded potato was moist and very flavorful as well. As for the mushroom neptunes- they're unique as they come in an escargot type of dish. The creamy mixture of cream cheese, crab meat and seasoning compliments the mushrooms so well! Their Cesar salad is great with tons of garlic and lemon in the dressing. I'll always come back!"}
{"text":"My Husband and I came for our 10th Anniversary. Friday May 11 2018.
The atmosphere was perfect intimate and warm. From the hand polished glasses to the comfy booth, impeccable. Laura was our server, she was warm, friendly and extremely knowledgeable. My husband has serched for a Caesar salad that compared to his Fathers homemade one for 20yrs. He found it! Laura was so generous to give a lil more. We also discussed level of doness for a burger, Laura was kind enough to request ours to be \" just\" done to sarisfy legality and my husbands preference. My 12oz top sirloin was perfection.
The delightful char flavor lingered. 
Laura presented us with a delicious slice of mocha cake for our Anniversary. Thoughtful we were quite touched. Highly recommend this location!"}
{"text":"The food is good, and there's a pretty good atmosphere in the bar, I feel it's a bit overpriced, though. Most importantly, for a place called \"The Keg\", their beer selection is seriously lacking."}
{"text":"went here for new years eve early dinner.  The wait staff was very helpful and the food was yummy. I had the zesty salmon, and my husband ordered the halibut and chips.  The chocolate cake was decadent!"}
{"text":"my mr H. took me here last week after i told him I wanted some good food but we did not want to make the drive to scottsdale. i do like the keg but IMO it can be a bit pricey for a chain restaurant that does not serve outstanding food. I went with the king crab legs and he went with sirloin steak and we both had baked potatoes.  i did have 1 glass of wine- sauvignon blanc and he had a beer. on the positive note the crab legs were pretty good and I'm going to try to make it for the happy hour one day, since the prices seem pretty reasonable for hh, staff is helpful and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"We like to take family members here because there is usually something for everyone to enjoy.  We had a love dinner and the location was convenient with parking.  We often go to another location of the Keg but we found this location was even more convenient for us.  The fish and steak dinners are consistently delicious.  The place is busy but the tables are not squished together so you can be comfortable and have a nice conversation.  We especially like this place for taking family because different generations all since to enjoy it!  Good consistent service."}
{"text":"I just moved to Brampton and I live so close to this place so I came to this location about 4 times and I loved the food every time I went!"}
{"text":"We gave the Keg another try and I had to update my review. Food was great, atmosphere inviting and service was awesome. I had the lobster and filet and both were  cooked to perfection. My son had the chicken and ribs and my husband had the end-cut prime rib. Goat cheese appetizer has been removed from the menu and replaced with a baked brie that everyone should try."}
{"text":"Great service and excellent food. Thank you so much. We needed a good meal. Love, love,love The Keg."}
{"text":"Anytime we come here, we get great service. No matter how busy they are. 
We went recently for Mother's Day. They were packed but we had amazing service. Our server was very friendly I just wish I remembered his name. But very nice guy. 
Food was delicious as always. My husband got the ribeye and I got the filet. His steak was the juiciest steak I've ever had. Probably will need to order it next time instead of my usual filet. 
My mom enjoyed her meal and even said they were way better than Flemings. The keg is better priced, food is tasty, and service is excellent."}
{"text":"Date night last night. Our server recommended his favorite bottle of wine.. some kind of blend. It was very good, and I don't usually go for blend wines. We both ordered french onion soup which was delicious. Then filet and crab for me, and filet and lobster for the woman. Everything was prepared well, minus the lobster which was overcooked and on the rubbery side. Prices are very reasonable here.. no prime meat, I don't think.. Our server made great suggestions, and did an awesome job. Would have been 4 stars if the lobster was prepared correctly-"}
{"text":"had a wonderful experience here from first drink to last bite. Atmosphere has a nice chic upscale feel to it and the lighting is nice and cozy. We waited in the nice bar while we waited for our table. The orange martini they have is just heaven. After a few of those down the hatch i tried a \"keg\" size glass of wine and was great as well. 

This is def a steak joint, so about 90% is all about steaks but there are some salads, fish and crab options. (they are also having a lobster special right now). Lover had the prime rib and crab combo and loved it( they are apparently really known for their prime rib) i went with the crab off course and did not disappoint. 

The staff was very nice and very patient and i noticed that just about everyone that works here is good looking also. just a pretty place filled with pretty people and good food!"}
{"text":"Awesome experience! Great food! We were told that it would be a 30min wait so we decided to have a drink at the bar while waiting. We were immediately served by Hailey who got us a drink within two minutes. She had a great sense of humour and was extremely nice. We ended up getting a seat in the dining room within 15 mins but decided to stay at the bar because of Hailey. Food was delicious brought out right away and hot. Great night and experience."}
{"text":"For the service and quality of food I don't think this place is too overpriced. I have been here twice and both times have been pleasurable. I will agree with fellow yelpers that the steak was a bit tough to cut (could be a combination of the grain and dull knives) but the taste is outstanding. Food is warm and cooked to perfection. Ambiance is semi-formal but it's common to see people in shorts and tee shirts. Lighting is dim but warm. Management is proactive and accommodating. The bread is good, appetizers are good (calamari is awesome), and surf and turf is excellent."}
{"text":"Walking in I thought it was going to be over-rated due to the trendy high end decor.  It wasn't.  The food is excellent, as is the service.  The decor is just a bonus.  :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, great place, great location. The Sea Bass was AMAZING!!!! The Lobster Starter was AMAZING!! Caesar salad was just so so. The only downside to this place with my experience was the 5 snooty hostess gals at the front desk. They weren't very welcoming but once we got past them our evening was great. Also, had to flag down waitress for more water twice. 

Overall food was amazing, price was worth every penny. We will be back again."}
{"text":"Great service and nice food! I am here third times in two weeks ! I am very love the service here! The service is better than the food! Each time I order the lobster, the lobster is good, but maybe they killed them early morning, taster is not perfect, but it still good. However, they alway have way make me feel happy! I am very love their service!"}
{"text":"Great dining experience. Met friends there & were able to have a nice conversation during dinner. Food was outstanding & the service was good for a packed restaurant. We will dine there again."}
{"text":"Hands down our new place to frequent for dates and special occasions! Fantastic service, amazing food and a very classy and beautiful ambiance. Great job management! Your choice team people are wonderful! We had the bacon wrapped scallops, garlic cheese toast, Caesar salad, Share Lobster and prawn plate and a 10oz medium Filet Mignon. Everything was PERFECT! They even complimented us 2 glasses of champagne to toast us for our Anniversary. And on my birthday a delicious mocha type cream pie. I'm wowed by great service every time we dine at the Keg. If you haven't been here, get here!!"}
{"text":"I think the quality has decreased in the last three years. My fiancé and I ate dinner here the other night and we felt like for the price, we did not experience an outstanding meal. 

For example the butter that they bring with the bread is not real butter. It's that with stuff that seems to have some type of canola oil added to it. The texture of the bread was nice but it's not sourdough and really didn't have much flavor. 

I asked for with a salad with dressing on the side it came on the top. They fixed it but again attention to detail when I'm spending $28 for meal is important. 

They made my fiancé old-fashioned incorrectly.   They were able to fix it but it still didn't taste right. I think they added simple syrup. It  had a strange sweet flavor to it. 

My fiancé did enjoy his meal they cooked a steak the way he wanted it and they left off the butter on his vegetables because he has a dairy allergy so that was good. 

My steak however was well done and I did not ask for it well done. The flavoring and seasoning was good though. 

Again for the amount of money we paid for that meal it definitely was not worth it. In my opinion the keg is just another one of those chain restaurants that charges a lot of money pretending to be a fancy restaurant and it's just average. There are many other options out there for a nice steak dinner where attention to detail is important."}
{"text":"Service is really good, but I'm not that impressed with their food.  I've had better sourdough bread and butter.  I hate that whipped butter, it seems fake to me.  The rolls are mass produced, boring, no character.  It's a chain, I get it.  I have a love of really good sourdough, and this doesn't cut it.

I had the prime rib and the au jus had too many herbs in it.  That was the first time I'd ever experienced it that way, and I didn't really care for it.  The meat was cooked well.  I asked for a baked potato with butter, sour cream, and chives.  No bacon.  It came out with bacon and no chives.  The quickly fixed it, so not really a huge deal, but then left the bacon potato on the table the rest of the dinner.  I don't really want to look at the potato with the bacon I didn't want for the rest of my meal.  

It's a fine restaurant for celebrations if you like to go to chains.  I prefer something more unique."}
{"text":"This is in our neighborhood and we have come here a handful of times when we didn't want to drive too far.  This place is decent but overpriced. We went in last night and we were seated early for our 7:15 reservation which was nice. Also, the hostesses were very friendly so that is always refreshing.  It was very busy but we noticed that the table that was seated after us was  served bread and drinks before us.  We had to flag the waiter down for some bread for our kids. After we placed our order, we waited a good 45 minutes for our food. When I ordered, I let the waiter know that I have a serious gluten allergy. He did write it down but the prime rib came out with fried onions on it so I had to send it back. The new one came out pretty quickly. We all rated our food as a 6 or 7. Decent but not great. Mine came with hard unseasoned asparagus so I could not even touch them. My younger son had the kid's sirloin but he said it was chewy and not cooked medium. My older son enjoyed his burger and my husband said his filet was \"fine\". Next time we will go to Ocean Prime which is similar in price but the quality of food and service is much better."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing! Offers veggie options, seafood, steak, chicken, you name it. The ambiance makes this a great place for romantic dates, special occasions, or even a business meeting. The layout offers a variance of options -- quiet and cozy, in the center of the action, bar fly, or relaxed outdoors.

The servers are all very professional and knowledgable on menu items as well as the wine list. 

My only suggestion for improvement is that they implement organic/sustainable/locally grown produce and meats into their menu."}
{"text":"We dined here on June 11.  Service was impeccable from the hostess to our waitress.  Our meals were excellent.  I am never disappointed when we dine at this Keg location."}
{"text":"Love the new layout - big restaurant with lots of nooks and crannies for some privacy. It's my favorite layout to-date! 

Food is the same as every keg, always predictable! Peppercorn steak is my go-to at the keg.

My low rating originated from the bad service we had. We had to keep asking for our server when we needed to order or ask for anything. Our waitress was no where in sight, and the place was pretty dead (so it's not like they were running around tending to other tables)."}
{"text":"Family and I went to The Keg after an ASU graduation. Other than the happy hour at the bar I was very disappointed. I ordered the prime rib with a side of crab legs. I requested the prime rib to be medium rare. What came out was an under cooked flavorless piece of meat. There wasn't enough salt on the table to give it flavor. The crab was also lacking flavor and a very small portion. In defense of the restaurant the entire staff was friendly and accommodating. The manager also stopped by and asked if everything was ok. I unfortunately didn't speak up. I would go back for the service and the happy hour, but I will be passing on the bland overpriced food."}
{"text":"So we decided to go to The Keg after a movie to top off our anniversary night out on a Tuesday. So we sat down and man what a restaurant. Our server was Kayla and what a top notch professional...from her flawless knowledge of specials to very good eye contact and a warm smile. We ordered some the Neptune on the appetizer menu and WOW...amazing. We then ordered the sesame tuna and pistachio salmon, of all things at a steakhouse in Arizona...WOW again...the tuna was top notch sushi quality, just melts in the mouth and the salmon was so good I even ate Brussel sprouts lol...we were thinking of dessert and in waiting for a dessert menu to our surprise, after I had told the waitress it was our anniversary, the manager shows up with a Billy Miner they called it, ON THE HOUSE!!! and WOW again. Thoughtful staff, amazing food...my new favorite restaurant in AZ...thank you so much and we will be back for sure in the future."}
{"text":"I am a local Canadian, so I know the Keg brand well.

I was travelling alone in AZ and had dinner at the bar. My wedge salad, beer and burger were an 8/10. 

That said, the service was an 11/10. I embarrassingly left my credit card at a golf course I had been at just before. I was trying to be solution oriented (eg paypal, venmo, come back tomorrow, credit card #). They let me just give the $17 I had in cash and waived the remaining. I will never forget...."}
{"text":"Went back to try again.  Forced to sit at the bar as they closed the dining area.  Unfortunately.  Service sucked. Again.  And apparently the kitchen staff don't know how to tell if veggies are ripe to serve or not.  And the rib steak, usually great, was way too full of fat.  I love some fat, but there was one big long piece of fat.  Well, guess I'll have to find a new steakhouse.  Oh wait, that's right.  Canyon CREEK is right across the bloody street.  Thank god!"}
{"text":"This is a good meal! I eat the filet and the twice baked potato is good too. The garlic mashed potatoes are very tasty. For two people, expect a check of around 70.00. Its a quick fix you can get without driving all the way to some fancier places like Ruth Chris."}
{"text":"This location used to be good. We returned to this location on Monday night, and did not have a good experience. When we walked in, there was 1 hostess and she was on the phone. She did not look at us even though we were standing directly in front of her, or acknowledge us in any way. No problem, you are busy and we are patient. There were not any other customers waiting. Eventually 2 more girls come up front, and one of them sat us at a table.

When we were sat, our waiter Mike did not come by to take our drink order. He eventually came to the table and told us about the specials and asked if we were ready to order. My wife asked him if they have Stella. At that point he looked perplexed, as in, Stella beer isnt an entree! She was trying to politely remind you we didnt have drinks Mike, you missed that hint buddy.

As you can imagine, we were slow to get our drinks, bread, refills, and main dishes. When we were able to ask for things (more bread and refills), we got the impression the waiter was annoyed because he was short on time. We both got the filet mignon with garlic mashed potatoes, which both tasted ok. The only reason the review gets 2 stars instead of 1 is because the good was ok.

After we were given our food, the waiter apologized for the unusual wait time for the filets and he stated the reason was a large party which walked in just before we did. That does not explain why the rest of the service was so poor!

We may consider either trying a new location or just going to a new place for steak all together. We spend $80.00 to $110.00 depending on what we order here, so I guess I just want a little service with that kind of bill for 2 people."}
{"text":"I am updating my post because of how amazing the manager Chris was with my issue. I will be returning and will definitely be sitting in the main area instead of the bar! Thanks for taking care of my issue and trying to rectify the problem!"}
{"text":"Wow what an experience! The food was excellent and the service was even better! Our waitress Claire was the best I've ever had. She had an extensive knowledge of the menu and was super friendly! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Grandma C's Birthday dinner. Her Bday is on Christmas eve. She loves The Keg so we knew long ago we were taking her here for her Bday. Since I made reservations awhile ago, we were sat upon arriving by the hostess who made polite conversation as we walked to our table.

Our server was Kody. He did a great job. He was pleasant, didn't bother us and was around when appropriate. Another great thing about The Keg is that the staff/servers are there to help. We asked a few different servers for things and instead of passing the inquiry off to Kody, they handled it themselves. Awesome way to train your staff. Honestly, the service was flawless. (That's a rarity in this business)

I ordered Baked Brie ($11) & Calamari ($11) to start. The baked Brie is exactly what it sounds like. A small wheel of Brie baked served with a basil pesto and red pepper jelly and sliced crostini. The only negative here is that the app does not come with enough crostini. Not an issue though because we asked Kody for more and he brought us out enough additional slices to finish the Brie. The Calamari is nicely fried and served with both a spicy sweet ginger garlic sauce and a Greek feta sauce. The Calamari was also perfect but we all found the fried Jalapeno slices as unnecessary.

C ordered the Kids 6oz Sirloin ($15). Cooked a perfect Medium, he devoured it without a hitch. His order came with fries and an ice cream sundae which were also a hit with C.

K ordered the 14oz Prime Rib ($35). She said the meat was perfect as were the sides she ordered.

The Bday girl Grandma C had the 10oz Prime Rib ($31). As with K's, the cut was cooked perfectly and Grandma C said her sides were also perfect.

I ordered the 12oz New York ($36). A perfect Medium Rare but my cut was a bit tough and had a lot more fat that I feel should have been trimmed before cooking. My sides were also deelish.

Since it was a birthday celebration, we all ordered dessert. C's entree came with a small Sundae but it was perfect for a 10 year old. Grandma C & K both ordered the Creme Brulee. They did a great job with this. The caramelized sugar crust was perfect as was the custard. I ordered the Billy Miner Pie. Seriously, death by scrumptiousness. Mocha ice cream on a chocolate crust with hot fudge, caramel and almonds. Mud pie nirvana. 

Exemplary service. Great Food. Fair prices for this level of service / food. 5 Star."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner at the last minute and we are never disappointed.

We ate at the bar and had a filet and the steak au poivre.

The service from Allie was great."}
{"text":"Anyone that knows me knows that I really love a good steak.  When we finally touched down and checked into the hotel this was one of the choices nearby.  Choices were abundant when it comes to steak so fair warning expect to leave nice and full when you come here.  I got the Ribeye and my friend got the filet and both were excellent.  Now I was a little put off that the Steak didn't come with two sides as most places serve but really our portions were so large it really didn't matter because I was so stuffed they needed to roll me out of that place.   Overall I had a pleasant experience, the wait staff was friendly and helpful.  I might be back before the end of this trip."}
{"text":"Had a Valentine's Day reservation for 7pm yet had to wait to be seated. A couple without a reservation got seated immediately at the bar... ANNOYING!Besides that, the meal was enjoyable and the waiter was awesome! My salad was good but the roasted chicken was a little overdone. The other half ordered a steak and was happy. Would have preferred the key lime pie have a little more bite to it but it still got eaten  All in all, the experience was decent."}
{"text":"Delicious!
My hubby and I come here quite often and we have become big fans!
We always order the French onion soup? Iceberg Wedge salad, filet mijon, and their famous twice baked potato!
Their food is always cooked to perfection and it always comes out very tasty.
Their happy hour is great as well.
I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"For my birthday again, I  think their baseball cut steak is best anywhere, can't  wait to get back there, always friendly, knowledgeable servers, managers come by to inquire of satisfaction, makes you feel appreciated."}
{"text":"Craving some meat?! The Keg will satisfy that craving. I wanted to take the hubby out and we decided to come here. The steak is good, the drinks are tasty and the service is great. Overall it may not be the best but The Keg is quite enjoyable and we would go again. 

Best tip - make a reservation as the wait can get quite extensive."}
{"text":"The Keg is a well known chain and deserves the good reputation they have.

I had an overall good experience at this location. The service was good, food came out fast and our steaks were cooked exactly as requested. 

Unfortunately this restaurant lacks ambiance. Arriving late on a Saturday night I expected to be seated quickly. To my suprised we were only the second table occupied.. The restaurant was dead. I was so fixated on the silence I let it ruin what my mind has made up as \"The Keg\" experience."}
{"text":"I went to this location plenty of times for birthday's, graduation, and special occasions.. No reservations needed. The keg by far is still the best steak house restaurant I have ever been too. Why? Service is always great which is very important to me and food is always delish!! I love that they always cook the steak like how I want them too. They once made a mistake on my bill by doubling the drink I ordered which was a strawberry daiquiri. I complained right away and the manager apologized and took it off. He even offered us free dessert which was awesome! Something that will make their guest happy and satisfied. This is exactly what makes me keep coming back is for the service!!!! And of course the great meal. I will definitely be back here!! I never leave unsatisfied with this place."}
{"text":"3 words...Twice Baked Potato! Oh my, these are so good!!! I love these so much I have even ordered them to go when we are grilling steaks at home. But it is always nice we we go there for dinner too. 

The rest is good as well. I've had the filet, prime rib, various appetizers, a delicious orange martini. 

Only once did I not enjoy my food. The one time I decided to order the peppercorn steak. Way too peppercorny. (is that a word? ;-)) It did live true to it's name but way too much. Couldn't taste anything else.

So stick with the basics and definitely get the twice baked potato."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and was not disappointed!  Our server Danyella was attentive and also very helpful.  The hostess made sure to ask if we were celebrating a special event (just the celebration of eating) and Danyella also checked about the occasion so she could make it memorable.  

We each got the prime rib which was cooked nicely but the cut was very thin for being a 10 oz portion.  My piece actually looked ragged like there was some issue when it was sliced off the roast.  They also do more of a reduced au ju instead of the liquid version which was just ok. Another disappointment was they were out of the Scallops and Bacon appetizer on a Wednesday.  Danyella was helpful to recommend some other app options but we had our hearts set on the scallops.

My companion was in the mood for a brownie Sunday but was ready to go home.  Danyella was nice enough to box it up to-go for us and was prompt with the bill so the ice-cream wouldn't melt before we got home.
Overall a nice experience with some food hick ups but will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I am a frequent diner at the Keg and have been for many years. My fav steak house--bar none. But, my issue is that when I eat at the bar and I ask for my steak (ordered with the classic as a combo) to be delayed after the salad to 30 minutes, it seems to be a complicated request. I hate power eating. If I want to power eat I will go to a drive thru. My steak always arrives cold or arrives within 15 minutes or so of the salad. Most Kegs just can't get it right. The Mansion can't, nor Yonge and Eglinton, Lesley Street and now Yonge and Sheppard is a miss as well. Maritimes and New Brunswick locations can, as well as the Ontario Richmond Hill location.  

Two thumbs up to newer waiter Aria at the Richmond Hill location off of Beaver Creek. He was my waiter in the fall last year. He's the only server in Ontario who has served the meal to perfection as requested.

So tonight's experience, the 8 oz classic meal was to be served with double veg. The whole meal was cold when delivered about 25 minutes after the salad. Salad was awesome though. When the steak was taken away I asked to charge me for the larger size, but the 8 ounce came back. It was however cooked perfectly (wrong size) and they forgot the double veg. which they ended up bringing out upon request.

Also disappointed to see when I went over my bill to find that the small (maybe 2-3 ounces side soda rang in at $3.50) I ordered a couple of Soho's for happy hour. The table menu picture shows a lovely full glass of Soho and I received two just over half full glasses. So I asked for extra soda as I figured it may be too strong. I have only ever paid $3.50 for a full size glass of soda not the side little ones. 

Anyways, the moral of the story is from now on, I am going to either go to Richmond Hill or order my dinner in stages and stick to Strongbow.

Sorry Keg, this instance has happened too many times at too many locations not to mention. 

Great atmosphere and decor at the new North York Yonge Street location though."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants my fiance and I have been to. In his opinion, \"it was worth every penny\". Excellent food and excellent service!"}
{"text":"I have always heard great things about the keg,  I just don't know why I Haven't been sooner. We started off with cocktails, I had the apple orchard martini and Javier had the whisky sour. Both drinks were made perfectly and I have found a new happy hour spot. For dinner we ordered the Manhattan new York strip and the Kansas City strip. Javier steak was huge,both were perfectly cooked (we ordered medium) the mixed veggies were fresh and didn't taste frozen and our twice baked potato was creamy on the inside and toasty on the top. No complaints at all,  and I'm very picky when it comes to how my food should be prepared and taste. We ended with dessert, carrot cake with 2 small scoops of vanilla ice cream. Again no complaints and everything tasted perfect. I had a birthday coupon for 25.00 that you get when you sign up on the guest list.  Our total bill with the coupon was $63 I don't think that's bad at all for 2 drinks, an iced tea, 2 entrees and dessert. We will be back for sure . Also I recommend the patio while the weather is still nice."}
{"text":"Been to several Keg's in US and Canada. While this one doesn't quite have the chill, upscale atmosphere of others, the attentive courteous staff went a long way to make up the difference. Sat in the bar area. Bartender Paul was friendly and passionate about food and drink. Made me a kickass negroni. Followed by a killer Napa Sangiovese blend.   

Started off with the escargot stuffed mushrooms. Quite tasty. The kitchen tried to pawn off some kind of cafeteria roll on me. I called it out immediately. Paul was shocked and quickly brought fresh sourdough. Apparently they ran out of proper rolls and went to the grocery store for a substitute. 

7 oz filet med rare. Fries. Veg. Pretty standard. I found the steak slightly undercooked, but didn't complain. This was definitely not a prime cut. Found it a bit chewy with tough strands of fat. Definitely doesn't compare to Alberta beef. And somewhat inferior to other US Keg restaurants in the US.  

Overall a good dining experience. This location offers ample space, lots of bar area seating, outdoor patio with misters, and friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Have to say-- totally amazed today.

Food-- steaks meeting standard medium/medium rare/ etc. Also tried tuna sesame which is seared on the outside and raw in the inside and it tastes really good;

Environment-- spacious, dark, and relatively quite. 

Services-- this is the part that led to this review actually. Overall quality of the waitresses are great. They are hot and always smiling and know well about the menu too. They did miss an order of drink but then offered complementary desserts. So totally turned around!

At the beginning I didn't expect too much for a chain restaurant but this is surprisingly good, at least this location. It is better than some fancy steakhouses in DT in my opinion."}
{"text":"Finally made it here for the first time! We are celebrating a friend's promotion and he picked the place. I was not in the mood for steak but worries about ordering fish from a steakhouse. I was assured there was nothing to worry about. 

We started with Calamari and Scallops & Bacon; both were delicious. The Calamari has excellent breeding and a noticeable, yet not overpowering spice. The scallops were perfectly cooked, which is rare to find, and the bacon was perfectly crispy. I would love to know how they perfected that technique. 

I ordered the Pistachio Crusted Salmon, and it did not disappoint. The salmon, another often overcooked item (especially from a non-seafood restaurant) was perfection, and the flavors of the dish combined wonderfully. The garlic mashed potatoes were also noteworthy. 

My husband ordered the Top Sirloin. He was very disappointed in the cut of meat. There were several ligaments in his cut, making for difficulty chewing. Top Sirloin cut should not have any muscle in it. 

Overall, we enjoyed the place, but were disappointed wthe butchering mistake, especially from a \"steakhouse\". While we would eat here again, it would probably not be a location suggested/initiated by us."}
{"text":"It was my first time to The Keg, and it was amazing. The food was delicious, my prime rib was cooked perfectly. Excellent service, our server Justin was witty and very efficient. I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Meh.  Everything was OK.  Atmosphere: Sports Lodge.  Beer & wine selections: fine, not the greatest.  Bourbon Smash cocktail: I've had and made better.  Food:  Sea Bass: over cooked, quinoa salad was SO heavy on garlic & onion (and I am a huge fan of these items), asparagus was cooked perfectly.  Hubbies steak: ordered MR, came MW.  Uncle's prime rib: ordered MR, came bloody, sent it back, came back WD.  All servers and staff were quite nice, though our waitress shared that she is sick of waiting tables....probably won't go back."}
{"text":"It was our date night and we decided to try The Keg. Food was excellent, the staff was great, great value for the $, our server Cody was the best!! We will be back!"}
{"text":"This really is a great place to go for a nice dinner.  Yes, it's a chain, but it really is a fancy place still.  They have excellent steaks.  I got some sort of blue cheese filet and it was amazing.  The style of the keg is more elegant than say, The Outback Steakhouse.  This is a more formal place, but still more affordable than say, Flemming's.  Service was good when we were here, and after the meal the manager came to check to make sure our experience here was good.  Well, it was.  Like the Terminator said, \"I'll Be Back\""}
{"text":"I wonder how their steak is here but don't EVER come here for happy hour with a big group. No joke. 

I came here the other day with a pretty big group for happy hour. The service was horrible, the food and drinks were mediocre. For drinks, I ordered the Orange Slice to start. It was a martini but tasted like a screwdriver with a splash of vodka. My second drink was the Pinot Noir. This one I liked. For food, we ordered the crab cakes, nachos and baked brie. The cheese on the nachos was really dry and didn't taste very fresh to me. I actually liked the baked brie. The cheese and pesto that it came with was really good. 

Service.. I've never been a waitress and I understand we were with a big group but I would think you would go around the whole group asking what everyone wanted. Plus there were 2-3 waitresses helping with our group. Never once did that happen. We basically had to flag down the waitress every time we wanted to order something. On top of that, we asked her for the happy hour menu maybe 3 times or more and she never once brought it. We ended up talking to the manager who eventually brought the menu and told him we were very disappointed in the service. We got an apology. I would've thought he could've at least gave us a small discount on the bill, or something complimentary. Anything. Nope. I won't be back for happy hour."}
{"text":"I decided I wanted to take the lover to dinner and since he wanted steak he wanted to try out the keg. 

For drinks I ordered some sort of chocolate martini which was very tasty. A bit on the weak side but tasty. I also ordered a cosmopolitan which ended up turning out to be very red. So you know what that means. Lol. I ended up ordering the top sirloin steak, medium. I felt that it came out a bit more well then I wanted. Especially around the outside. Once you got inside the steak it was a little bit more medium. My boyfriend got the prime rib. He enjoyed it but apparently it wasn't the best prime rib ever. The customer service was good. I'd probably want to try the filet next time I came back."}
{"text":"I am so astounded with how terrible the meal I just experienced was that I literally opened my phone as soon as we exited the restaurant. 
4:30 is usually a great time to arrive at a restaurant. Chefs aren't busy, they take time with your food and it usually comes out much faster. 
Well not at the Keg. There were all of 4 people in the restaurant and it still took 50 Minutes to get food on the table. Little did I realize that the reason it took this long was because they were taking extra time to cook out any flavor or moisture. 
My sons burger was so dry and over cooked, it crunched. It CRUNCHED. Like... the hamburger patty, guys. 
I ordered crispy fried chicken and got chicken strips that were bone dry and had NO taste to them. I wish I were exaggerating. I mean, I'm an adult at a semi-decent restaurant. I'm not trying to order chicken strips. 
One of the \"strips\" was a bone covered in batter and fried. I have photographic evidence of this. Lol
The slaw was basically undressed cabbage and corn. It was actually dry. My brain literally cannot compute what was happening on that plate. 
My daughter had chicken strips and they were so over cooked she couldn't even bite into them. Fries were good, but how does one screw up French fries?
Husband got the \"special\" which was sirloin (which was cooked right but not seasoned) and it also had scallops and a single shrimp. All the seafood was severely over cooked. 
Now, I'm a nice person and I very RARELY get this heated over a bad meal, but the staff didn't even question if our meal was okay as they removed completely untouched plates of food and handed us a $120 bill. Not even a blink. 
I don't know who you all have running this place but quality is at a low Ive literally never experienced. What's worse was walking out to all the happy people with balloons exiting Red Robbin next door. Lol! That sucked because we ALMOST went there. Ahhh so close. 
Anyways, we are picking up crummy fast food and heading home so we can eat something before dark....Lord have mercy."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. Started with the lobster wrapped in bacon!! Oh my God tasty!! Dinner was the prime rib, end cut requested and received. Score!! All served by a very respectful and kind young man of the name Kane. I will return, you don't come across service and food this great very often."}
{"text":"Good Steaks but no atmosphere. It's a cross between somewhere trying to create a 'scene' and the Outback Steakhouse.
Laminated menus and explanations of what 'medium-rare' is kinda says it all for me."}
{"text":"After an indepth conversation with the manager, I decided to give this place another try. 

During happy hour, or before 7pm we arrived at the KEG. The atmosphere again is very pleasant and inviting. It seemed packed on the outside with so many cars that we through it would be crowded inside, but with all the room it has that it did not seem crowded. The hostess was kind and asked if we wanted dining which was a 30 minute wait or the bar. We took the bar of course which serves the same food anyway, as well as has the same great relaxing environment. We took a small booth and settled in. 

The happy hour menu was small and very weak in the offerings. My wife ordered a glass of wine, while I had one of the fruitier drinks (Pear something). Mine was tasty and perfect. 

We ordered some appetizers, the spring rolls first. after which we ordered they brought us out baked chips and bread. Enough for a small platoon, we nibbled on each as well as had our yummy spring rolls. So far so good....

We ordered the casual dinners which consisted of a 7 oz filet Mignon and fries. Again disappointed with the filet, and had to resort to A1 sauce to get some type of flavor out of the steak, my wife did the same. 

Overall: For the atmosphere, the appetizers and the drinks this place is worth going, however if your looking for a great steak, this is not the place and for the quality well over priced."}
{"text":"Awesome environment,  you can sit inside or outside and gave a good experience.  The steak is amazing I got the baseball top sirloin and my lady got the chicken.  Highly recommended and the drink selection is in point"}
{"text":"I was in Arizona for work, and stumbled upon this spot after hunting around in my rental car for a decent dinner spot close to my hotel.

The decor is nice, and I like the option to sit indoors or out. We opted to sit in the bar, and got a nice comfy booth.

Our waitress was fantastic. I am not a huge steak fan, and made a decision on what to order pretty quick, but my friend had a ton of questions about the menu.(Yes, she is one of those annoying orderers)  The waitress was very patient and friendly and gave some great recommendations. The manager also checked on us throughout our meal which is always a nice touch.

For my meal, I started with the french onion soup, which was amazing. Sometimes I find french onion to be too salty, but the one at the Keg was made just right. For a main entree i went with the mustard salmon and garlic mashed potatoes. The salmon was excellent and the potatoes were tasty as well.

My friend ended up going with the the homerun steak, or maybe it was called the pitch. (Something to do with baseball but I do not quite remember.) The steak came out and we were both surprised. It was huge. My friend loved it though, and said it was cooked just right. 

We were both stuffed about halfway through our meals, so we opted to not do dessert. 

Overall, I really liked this restaurant. I found the prices to be really good for a Steakhouse as well. Service was excellent and food was yummy. I would return."}
{"text":"Atmosphere and service are excellent.  One issue .. Granted this is perhaps overly specific.  I've had the prime rib here twice .. It has been disappointingly tough.  Don't know much about meat (except how to eat it) but their cuts are so lean I think they tend to get over cooked.  So, my advice is if you like your prime medium .. Order medium rare.
Want to give it more stars .. Can't, for now."}
{"text":"I still love this steak place. Have been here several times in Whistler and first time here in Toronto and the food is still absolutely delicious.  Love their appetizers ( crab cake and mushrooms) and their prime rib is perfect! The entrees come with vegetables and a choice of your side dish. My friend ordered the braise short ribs and it was pretty good. Falling off the bones, tender and very flavorful. Service was excellent and  very friendly.  Would always come back whenever I'm in Canada."}
{"text":"I do not recommend this place AT ALL!  It honestly tastes like an extremely over priced microwaveable dinner. I ordered a filet mignon medium rare. There was absolutely no taste to anything. Maybe the chef forgot all the spices. The vegetables tasted like they came from a can. My filet was also over cooked to a well done. There was no juicy pink center. Very unhappy."}
{"text":"This was my first time going to The Keg,  and it will be my last.  I went there for my friends birthday and it was an interesting experience to say the least. 

My friend and I were the first to arrive at the resturant(we got there a couple minutes early),  so we went up to tell the hostess,  to which they informed us that our table wasn't ready (my friend made reservations days before).  Okay fine,  the rest of our party wasn't there so we didn't mind waiting. 20 mins later they come and tell us it's ready,  so my friend and I go to the smallest looking booth that was apparently for us. We had 7 people joining us,  and the booth could only fit 6 people (it was a snug fit) plus they put a chair at the end of the booth, so the person sitting there was in the middle of the aisle (not a comfortable place).  I thought that that was really stupid on their part. If you know days in advance that you have a birthday reservation for 7 people,  pick a good booth or table that accommodates everyone!  I saw gropus of smaller people who got bigger tables then us.  

Okay fine,  let's move on.  I ordered a raspberry margarita and I was BEYOND disappointed.  Normally it's suppose to be like a frozen drink,  but instead they had it so it was a regular drink with a Huge Ice block in the centre,  and there was no salt around the rim of the glass either (in the description of the drink,  it said it had salt on the rim,  and Nothing about a huge ice block) . The ice cube did nothing because my drink wasn't even cold,  it was warm.  I ordered the Thai Chicken dish with a side of the twice baked potato,  but they got my order wrong.  I got the garlic mash potatoes instead.  I asked them about it,  and they brought my twice baked potatoe,  but it was burnt.  

Finally,  when it was time  to pay,  I asked our waiter if she could bring back 6.00 in change (I paid in cash which included the tip for her,  I just need back the 6.00). She then said that she would have to go to the bar,  and when she came back,  she reduced my bill sizes to smaller amounts,  and I didn't even get the change! She did not understand it at all.   

Over all,  it was a weird experience,  and I would not recommend going here to anyone.  It's poorly lit,  the prices are way to high,  and the service wasn't that good. I would rather go to a cheaper resturant with better lighting,  food,  service and better pricing.  

It will be my last time going here."}
{"text":"We had a party of six who went for a birthday celebration.  Awesome drinks, awesome service, awesome food!  The prime rib was as good as the reviews said it was, the blue burger (made with prime rib) was so juicy the bread did get a little soggy but oh so delicious, the prime rib sandwich was amazing and the au jus was delicious.   I would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I was initially a bit leery of this place, based on location and vibe: kind of a pricey, chain-like steak place. However, I left pleasantly surprised, and was very pleased w/ the attentive service (thanks, Justin), and a really tasty NY Strip that was well-marbeled and perfectly cooked. The only negative was the bar. Bartender needs to learn how to make an Old Fashioned, and the Grey Goose martini I had tasted watered down . . . Otherwise, really good meal!

Cheers!

{"text":"The best combination of cake and ice cream all in one. I would love this cake personally delivered to me every night. So rich and yummy. Never disappointed by it!"}
{"text":"Blue cheese olive, dirty martinis TO DIE FOR!! Best ever!!!! Started with ahi tuna appetizer and then prime dinner, DELICIOUS! Won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place has a great happy hour!! 3pm-7pm every day. My favorite item on the happy hour menu is the Prime Rib Sliders! They are so tender and juicy! They also give a large wine pour! But, everything on the happy hour menu is good! The shrimp, mushrooms, nachos, brie...it's all wonderful. So cheap you can order several things for the table."}
{"text":"We came to Keg for steak and we got plenty of it. I tried the smaller ribeye, a 10oz portion, rather than 14oz. The meat was delicious though a tad overdone for medium rare. The au jus was delicious and the atomic horseradish was what really sold the meal. That horseradish has a serious kick which is the perfect accompaniment to the steak, especially as you get tired of just eating meat... this is a classic meat and potatoes place, nothing fancy here. The Brussels sprouts weren't very good and the twice baked potato was so-so, but the steak itself was great."}
{"text":"Don't have any of these near me in Philadelphia so I came here off of recommendations. Food was awesome, place was clean, and servers were more than hospitable. 

Giving it three stars because I just didn't like the place so much. Kinda expected it to be a better experience or something special... which it wasn't. The food wasn't bad by any means but the \"hype\" people have for this place is completely unjustifiable. 

Definitely worth trying but I'd recommend Cheesecake Factory or Red Lobster for the same type of atmosphere/ambiance/$$$ for a \"upper-level casual\"."}
{"text":"They have the best chef ever!! He is professional and takes pride in the meals he prepare."}
{"text":"My wife and I dined here for our anniversary and we had a great time. Awesone service and delicious food! They pay attention to the details. I appreciated the manager stopping by to check on us. When the server asked what the occasion was we were served a complimentary glass of champagne...nice touch!"}
{"text":"Great food
Great atmosphere
A lot of alcohol drinkers 
Will come back
High in priced
Less in value and quality 
Compare to Fleming's and Firebird"}
{"text":"Was a great place with good food.  Everything came out cooked as ordered and we had a large group of 15 with reservations made only 2 hours earlier.  We were sat quickly and no ones glass every got empty.  Great service"}
{"text":"We have been dining at The Keg ever since it has been open in Desert Ridge. Staff is always very pleasant and accommodating. Good steaks, great HH. Always look forward going back!"}
{"text":"The food and wine deserve a 5 out of 5! We ordered the Baked Brie to start and it was so delicious. The brie partnered with basil pesto and red pepper jelly was the perfect combination! For dinner we ordered the Filet Mignon and Pistachio Crusted Salmon and both were absolutely amazing! However, we sat in the patio and the service was so-so. We sat for a good amount of time before our server came to our table. And that lack of timeliness was carried throughout the meal. But I wonder if the dining room would have had better service? Overall, the food is worth coming back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic our server was fantastic and on point, I'm a server myself and personally appreciate the service. Food was amazing, we all scarfed it down with a wonderful bottle of chardonnay recommended by the server. Just all together an amazing experience, thank you (Jonathon I believe was the name)"}
{"text":"Dining at The Keg is always a fun experience. I love going there alone to enjoy a nice meal at the bar and try to impress the pretty bartender with all my amazing Tinder stories. Hopefully she's already has a Tinder account, that always helps. Anyways, let's get back to the food... the food is great. I just wish The Keg made Mac & Cheese as a side dish."}
{"text":"The food is superb! The one experience (out of many visits) that I had my steak miscooked was remedied immediately by the staff and the meal was comped so I have nothing bad to say! Every other time has been delightful. And save room for dessert... The Billy Miner pie is a nice end to a great meal."}
{"text":"like to go 4 stars or more on it...the atmosphere an service were great...food left many unanswered questions....escargot had some of the biggest snails we have had in a long time and the price was right...girlfriend and I could not figure out the sauce...I thought curry she thought mustard but we were told ginger...ok well ginger would make no sense anyway...just a simple garlic butter please....Cesar salad was crisp and clean but i doubt an anchovy was within a few miles of it....Calamari was nice but sauces didn't go with it...the ginger one may have but too sweet...orderd a pepper steak...we both thought a nice green peppercorn sauce but the steak was covered in large pieces of cracked pepper...manager was good enough to replace with a plain cooked steak but still a little salty...had the waitress bring a sample of the Bearnaise for the calamari but not sure there was any tarragon in it or that it was even a hollandaise  to begin with...beer and wine were nice value...butter was whipped and lacking in flavor...so get a real chef to work on the menu and you got a 4+ rating I'm thinking..."}
{"text":"My family went to The Keg as a graduation celebration.  We arrived late after the ceremony and it wasn't very crowded.  We were immediately seated and there was a congratulation card signed by the staff already at the table for my son, a very nice touch and started the dinner off very well.  We went there for steak and intended to just order our favorite cuts with the usual side dishes.  THEN...we noticed the \"Feature Cuts\", and there was no turning back.  They take your favorite cut of meat and add sauces and other flavors to create truly awesome dishes.  We went from just having steak to the Blue Cheese Filet, Sirloin Oscar, and Peppercorn New York.  All were terrific. Overall the experience was excellent, the food was great and the staff was extremely friendly, efficient and helpful.
The only thing keeping The Keg from 5 stars is the price.  It is expensive!  You get what you pay for, but you pay a lot.  $300 for 5 people to me is a lot, your tastes may vary.  If this is in your price range, your money will not be better spent elsewhere."}
{"text":"Went on valentine's Day. Generally i'm smart about spending and this place although a little costly makes you feel like  a king. That's why I tipped like a king. Amazing service. Amazing bread. Amazing tasting food. Perfect ambient lighting with romantic yet laid back and inviting atmosphere. Love this place. Will be back. Server was one of the black guys, awesome guy."}
{"text":"Tonight was our first time eating at The Keg. Honestly it was great. The French onion soup was AMAZING. The steaks were cooked perfectly and tasted amazing. Waitress was nice and attentice, manager came to make sure our night was going well. Overall I'd recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Nice young man waited on us, but not the best prime rib I've ever had. Ok if your hungry and it's close but don't drive out of your way"}
{"text":"Came to celebrate a birthday dinner during the week. Came in around 5:30 and got seated right away. We had the prime rib and a filet, cooked to perfection, med rare. Even the martini was amazing, lemon and ginger, who knew? Service was outstanding, attentive but not overbearing....I wish I could remember his name, Mike?? A 40ish, cool family guy from Jersey. Anyway we'll be back."}
{"text":"I had an absolutely phenomenal dinner tonight. Our waiter, Greg, provided amazing service, very polite and personable. They brought out children's appetizer trays for the kids which was a life saver. I ordered the pistachio crusted salmon which was to die for. The atmosphere was relaxing yet not at all boring. It was my birthday so they treated our table to cheesecakes and ice cream bowls. They even gave me a happy birthday card. I'm super impressed with this place. I'll definitely be coming back for more."}
{"text":"My first time going to the Keg and it was great. Waiter was absolutely amazing and would regularly check up on us. Despite being at a steakhouse I had to try the honey glazed salmon. It was tasty and cooked perfectly medium which is just how I like it. Asiago rice and asparagus were ok too but my calamari appetizer was also a hit . Great selection of wine as well.

Restaurant was quite dark but it worked very well with the medieval keep-theme this particular keg had. Made for a relaxing and enjoyable night out. Great first impressions'"}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service! Had an extremely nice waitress who was very helpful think her name was Claire."}
{"text":"I've been to this location 3 separate times and enjoyed the food the first two times.  However, last night was the first time I had a bad experience.  I specifically came for the Sea Bass, as it was fantastic the last two times I ordered it.  I split it with my date and we also shared a Shrimp Cocktail and Salad.  The shrimp and salad were first rate.  The fish however was not cooked, and a piece I cut for my girlfriend was raw.  When I mentioned it to the server, she quickly had another entrée remade for us.  We were told by the server that they intentionally cook the Sea Bass \"medium\".  This fish was obviously under cooked by accident.  Both times I've  ordered  this dish in the past it was cooked perfectly, so I know what to expect.  In the end the manager comp'd us for the Bass, but did not offer anything else to make up for their mistake.  It would have been nice if he had offered something additional for our bad experience.  In the end I paid $60 for a salad, shrimp cocktail, and 2 glasses of wine.  I know they have good steaks here, but next time I want fish I'll go to a seafood restaurant'"}
{"text":"As my two and a half year old would say \"It was deeee-wish-iss\"

First let me commend the service. I believe her name was Laura and we had a business party of 10. She was fantastic. The meals came out at a good time, she knew the menu, drinks stayed full, she was genuinely friendly, and never once seemed rattled by her large party. Excellent job!

I had the 7oz bacon wrapped filet with the twice baked potato. The steak was cooked as ordered and oozing with flavor. I'm picky about my baked potatoes and it was done perfectly. Absolutely delicious meal. A few of us shared a Billy Miner Pie for dessert which was also fantastic! This was my first experience here and will be bringing my wife back with me!"}
{"text":"This place is trying to be really fancy, but I would consider it only to be a slightly \"fancier\" steakhouse than Outback (based on the decor, what they make the hostesses wear, prices, etc.).  And just judging on the food, I'd rather eat at Outback!  I think the steaks at Outback are better, as well as the sides, like the mashed potatoes, veggies, and other dishes.  Plus the Outback bread is way better than the sour dough they serve.

I ordered the prime rib burger and the mashed potatoes as a side.  The burger was decent, the regular stuff you'd expect.  I wish the patty was a little more flavorful.

So overall, just a regular, decent restaurant.  You could definitely do worse, but I don't envision myself making too many return trips here."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere, waitress was efficient only got engaging and friendly right before it was tip time. Food was prepared well and served hot. Parking is atrocious!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service. Our server Lauren was very professional and prompt. Both our meals were over the top. I had the surf and turf and my wife had the salmon. Both cooked to perfection. Sat outside with no wait. Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"I was in Chandler for a conference and, with the help of Yelp, I found this great restaurant!  The service was great and the food was very delicious.  I asked my server what his favorite dish was, and he suggested \"Rib roast with Oscar topping, crunchy onions and twice-baked potato.\"  I ordered it and I LOVED it!  Although I don't think I will be coming back to Chandler anytime soon, I will definitely keep this place bookmarked!  I hope to be back again!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to the Keg twice this week while we are visiting Scottsdale. The food is excellent and
the staff is very pleasant, professional, and helpful. Libby and Jessica were our servers this week and we could be more pleased. High marks for both food and service"}
{"text":"Came here to take one of my best friends out to eat since I usually visit her once and that's during the holidays. So we decided to come here for some drinks and tapas aka HAPPY HOUR. 

Service was great but can't say the same about their food. It was alright. We got a side cesar salad, bahn mi sliders, wings and fries. A lil disappointed on the taste of the sliders could have been a lot better. But at least all the other tapas were good. And our drinks were delish! Our server was super sweet serving us and making recommendations on our choice of drink selection. Location is very nice as it is in the middle of the shopping plaza where you can shop and then come for some good grub afterwards!"}
{"text":"I love the Keg I go a few times a year, usually sit in the bar so I can have happy hour and the regular menu. I adore the goat cheese. This time I had the French onion soup, the goat cheese, and an Orange Slice Martini. I also had a bite of a chicago style rib eye and it was absolutely to die for. 

Everything was really delicious and the server was great!"}
{"text":"Well, hit there at end of happy hour. Got charged for HR apps but regular price drinks. Flash forward (30 min wait) to dinner, my filet was awesome, hubby had to return his steak twice (ordered medium rare, first was medium well and and second was rare)...so basically I was done eating by the time he started... Service there after was abysmal, waiting forever for bill (they did comp steak but no apologies, free dessert, etc for our wait). So sad, use to love this place..."}
{"text":"Great steak! Cooked exactly to my liking. Not like most places where when you say \"medium\" it's cooked all the way thru! With this place, you actually see red in the middle and can chew the steak! Portions are fairly big so you can always share apps and entrees. Happy hour from 4-7 on Monday to Fridays. During happy hour, they have a delicious Orange Martini for around $3! Would definitely give that a shot. If you're not into fruity drinks, beer is around $2 as well as half price wines. Certain apps are also part of happy hour. Like I said, portions are pretty big so you can save by sharing. We've paid around $53-$70 and well worth it. Not bad for a good steakhouse! Crowd is a bit older but who cares when you're enjoying the food right?"}
{"text":"I came here for a financial dinner on Nov 16, 2017.  We were given 4 options, roast chicken, prime rib, salmon, and a sirloin steak.  The 10-oz prime rib was among the best I ever had.  Red throughout to the edge.  I did not like the horseradish, even tho server brought me the \"creamed\" one, it did not have enough sour cream, and was harsh, and sinus exploding, even with a tiny dab.  Golden Corral makes the best mix of sour cream to horseradish.  They do most everything right for half the price of the Keg.   The mashed  potatoes was good but unremarkable.

I did not like two of the servers so much either, a black man and a white lady with dark hair.  They were not friendly, and almost seemed to serve with a silent grudge that made me wonder what they were thinking.  

I had the cheesecake to go.  It was really gooey and sticky.  

The price includes sides, while other steakhouses only give you the meat for the same price.  But I think I would only return for my half price birthday dinner."}
{"text":"Well what can i say The Keg redeem themselves.  The manager Danny made it right. He invited us back and our server Jay was amazing.  He was attentive and probably one of the best servers ive had in awhile. The food was excellent too."}
{"text":"Meh - came for happy hour and ordered the bacon  wrapped scallops. Tastes super fishy and the happy hour (HH) J Lohr Cabernet was super sweet like it had been sitting out a couple of days uncorked.

30 minutes between each server visit. I understand it's HH and they don't want to serve a lot; but my friend and I waited 20 minutes after saying we were good to getting asked out our bill. They could've had a table freed up.

Because of the wait, I just invited my husband to come for dinner. We ordered dinner - I ordered filet mignon - medium and it came out medium well. After at least a 30 minute wait; and again, only one visit from our waitress regarding drink refills (still within HH).

She asked how dinner was and I said my steak was over cooked. She offered to have another come out; but I was too hungry to wait another half an hour so I said no thanks.

Could have had way better service and comparable dinner at JC's. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"A welcome staple in a sea of useless and mediocre family chains dotted across Brampton. Solid mains, reliable and friendly service, great lounge area, late hours, and central location. When its busy there is a Moxies next door but this place is way better. Def recommend if looking for a decent joint in Brampton that won't disappoint."}
{"text":"A dear friend was in town and loves the Keg but doesn't have one in his town. We ordered the brie for an app and it was small but good. It came with little pieces of toast and some jelly and pesto. He had a sirloin, oscar style with asparagus,crab,scallops and bernaise. I had the short ribs. The server,Hannah, was fantastic. She mixed up my side, which wasn't her fault as I changed my mind 3different times ( mashed....no..wait, twice baked...no...regular baked...no...twice baked etc...) but she remedied the problem right away. My friend is a manager at a high end steak house in Tahoe and when he complemented her, she informed us that it was only her second week! She kept up on his coffee, which isn't easy, brought everything in a timely manner and was super friendly. We thoroughly enjoyed our time there and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been to a few steakhouses, but nothing beats Keg's rib steak. Also love their cream Brûlé dessert, it's very delicious. Tried their baked brie appetizer and pared with pepper jelly its very good. I wish they would sell that pepper jelly, delicious with brie. Service was perfect too. Not annoying but always there when we needed. Love The Keg."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff! I was solo so I sat at the bar. Courtney and Jeremy were all smiles and super efficient... Be careful not to fill yourself with the yummy bread and the huge tasty Caesar salad before your perfectly cooked steak arrives! It didn't really need any seasoning but you should try their sauces. Mojito was made to perfection. I've been here before, and when I find a place like this I always come back! Oh yeah! Great soundtrack too! ;)"}
{"text":"Ordered the rib-steak and twice baked potato. The steak was a bone-in 20oz ribeye, it was cooked perfect but was lacking seasoning. The twice baked potato was outstanding. My wife ordered the bacon wrapped fillet and a twice baked potato. She also thought the steak was a bit bland. Overall the food was good and we will continue to have dinner here a couple of times a month."}
{"text":"Where do I start...the manager seems to be just out of high school with some weird fauxhawk hairdoo. I found this out when my prime rib arrived cooked like beef jerky when ordered medium rare. The 2nd prime rib showed up cooked to order but nothing like it should have tasted for the price. The outdoor seating was nice except for the random exhaust fumes and noise when cars drove past. The lobster was small in size and the waiter was a little odd.Overall, this was not a good expeirience and I will not go back. Way overpriced and poorly operated."}
{"text":"Follow-up to previous posting on the Keg Steakhouse in San Tan.  The Kitchen manager contacted me within 5 days of my posting and was very understanding of my disappointment from our visit.  He did provide me with a coupon and his business card to have us come back to this location.  My only issue now is that why wasn't it handled  like this from the start?  I do appreciate the professional manner in which I am now being treated.  I added one star to my previous 2 star rating.  Time will tell..."}
{"text":"Very disappointed on our last visit.  Prefer the Tempe location for both customer service and food.  We were celebrating my wife's birthday, after waiting for more than an hour on the patio in the heat, we learned that the prime rib was sold out.  The waiter was great (Don) but the manager was poor when asked a service question.  Will not visit this location in future, back to Tempe.  food was over seasoned... too salty"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere & pretty good food which was reasonably priced. Order was messed up w/waiter & manager was all over to correct w/out being asked along w/complimentary dessert! Well done"}
{"text":"I was so very excited to finally try the Keg but I was truly disappointed in the meat selection. I got the top sirloin and it was terrible... so tough. Great service but will never go back."}
{"text":"The restaurant is worn and badly needs renovation. Evident while waiting for a table (short 5 min wait without a reservation). Harder to see without looking closely when at the table, which is probably why they keep it so dark in there. Seriously, it's like night club dark. 
The Ceasar salad was mediocre, nothing special to the dressing. Bland. 
The Garlic shrimp appetizer was served in a escargot dish, and the shrimp were real small, maybe U-40's. Very tasty, but the presentation is very 1990. 
Service was excellent and friendly. Food was ok. $48. for a top sirloin with side/salad. Steak was cooked perfectly, Medium-rare. My wifes Prime Rib was also perfectly medium as she asked and was very tasty.  Twice-baked (ok, if you say so) potato was served with gobs of butter and sour cream. So by the time it hit the table, it was cold inside and everything was melted and runny. At this price point, surprised they don't cut open the potato and hand spoon the accoutrements in tableside? The outside of the potato skin could have been washed better also it was very gritty.  It was served with a garnish of grilled red pepper, half was burnt and the other half looked like it hadnt touched the grill, I didnt even try to eat it. I think this is a kind of lazy kitchen and not very creative Executive chef. 
The cream brulee' was delicious, again, just a plain last century presentation. (compared to a Creme Brulee we had the night before in Ottawa at the Hilton Casino Hotel, no comparison, that was delicious and beautifully updated with a creative dish and delicious fresh fruit garnishe'. 
So, to sum up, this place has good quality beef, good drinks, Excellent service and that's it. The several large hotels next door catering to the business traveller  and their expense accounts is the key to its success but if you are spending your own hard earned money there are much better more modern choices.
Dined here on 6/7 while on vacation."}
{"text":"Brought the whole family to celebrate my sisters birthday. The food was absolutely superb. Loved all our orders. And the service was topnotch! The best steak place to eat in when in Gilbert. They even gave us free cake when they learned it was her birthday. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Sorry, but besides my spinach salad (which was wonderful and totally responsible for the two starts given!) all else was greatly disappointing.  My blue cheese filet came covered in overcooked, dried out bread crumbs - black on the bottom - where the heck was the blue cheese???... the veggies on the plate, which were suppose to include asparagus, had numerous asparagus STALKS and I believe two asparagus tops - all the veggies were undercooked - nearly raw - and tasteless.   Horrible presentation for the price.  Our waitress disappeared half way through the meal and we couldn't get any service - had to walk up to another waitress to pay my bill.   And what is it with those super tight super short waitress \"uniforms\"???  That alone tells me where managements  minds live -   Are we back in the 1970's ?   Nearly $200.00 with a $32.00 bottle of wine and tip and I've had better meals at hamburger joints.    Sorry, Keg - won't be back."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I had dinner last night in the bar.  The bartenders immediately greeted us and followed up on a regular basis.  She ordered a filet, I ordered steak and lobster.  Her steak was perfect, my medium rare order was slightly over cooked.  Without question the bartender took it away, the manager stopped by and before long I had a fresh plate - perfectly cooked. 
Five stars based on food and overall service."}
{"text":"Christine's service was top notch, my first visit ever was a fantastic experience because of it. Great live lobster, great shrimp cocktail, great Billie miner pie!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent experience again.

Service: Waiter was very attentive, knew the menu, came to refill drinks often, was friendly and courteous.

Food: Lobster, crab were great. Top sirloin tender and juicy.

New: They have these awesome pill shaped towelettes that expand in water. Best thing ever!"}
{"text":"In the area and the team wanted steak.  The wait wasn't too long, but waited at the bar.  I started with an orange peel martini.  We got seated and ordered the bacon wrapped scallops to start.  Pretty good.  I've had bigger and better ones at 94th aero.  3 out 5.  I then ordered the an off the menu 24 Oz prime rib.  Other gents ordered:  rib steak and top sirloin.  My prime rib rates at 3.5 out of 5 for my steak.  Had better at filippi's.  I'm disappointed cause this spot is most popular for their prime rib.  Mayne I'm not a steak connoisseur but I know what I like.  I ended with a simple cheese cake.  See pics."}
{"text":"Came here for a late night snack and drink, there was no line and decided to sit at the bar since we didn't want a full meal.  The place wasn't that busy, but it was a Sunday night.

The restaurant was a little dark and had a hard time reading the mini menu so i had to hold it by the candlelight to read it.  The bartender was prompt in greeting us and took our drink orders right away and gave us full menus in case we wanted a full meal.  

I had the seafood stuffed mushrooms and crabcakes.  The food came out in no time at all and was piping hot and the waitress made sure we knew that.  The mushrooms came with a dinner roll and served in an escargot dish.  They were smothered in cheese and very tasty, the bread came in handy to each with the cheese.  The crabcakes were on the small side, thought they would be bigger for the price.  They were also nice and crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, served with a nice caper mayo with a hint of spicy.  The squirt of lemon added the right touch.  

Nice restaurant, a bit pricey but a good place for a romantic dinner.  The decor needs some work since the paintings/wall art had pictures of women's legs and people talking intimately.  Not sure what theme they were going for."}
{"text":"My boyfriend told me about this place.  He had been to the one in Canada and this location is the closet one to home.  (about 6 hours away) After a few weeks I gave in a decided if it meant that much to him we would make the trip.   ABSOULTY LOVED IT!!   I had the bleu cheese filet that was wrapped in bacon with twice baked potatoes.   It was to die for.    I also tried a lemon drop martini that was also delicious.   I also had to sample his prime rib cheeseburger and I must say I was also very impressed.    Our witness and the hostess were all very polite and we will be back next time we are in AZ."}
{"text":"Love this steak house!  Great variety of cuts, always cooked as requested.  As a gal, the portion is large for me, so I have lunch left overs the next day. The sides are yummy (salads, garlic mashed...) Enjoy a glass of wine in the bar while waiting for your table."}
{"text":"The Keg is a chain steak house in Canada.  This is the second one I have been to.  Overall, the food is of a consistently good quality.  And absolutely go with what they know (hint: check out the name above).  In other words, \"never order fish at a steakhouse, never order steak at a fish house\" applies here.  This location is typical of other airport-area restaurants.  The clientele is transient (like me), desperate for attention (like me), and multicultural, diverse, and interesting (nothing like me).  The beers are pretty standard Canadian and there are some nice wines for pairing.  Typical of other steakhouses, they are pretty religious to the definition of rare, medium, well, etc. so order your steak based on the temperature or color that you prefer.  Solid place and highly recommended for when you are stuck near the YYZ.  Walking distance to many area hotels or you can always drive your red barchetta if it is a little out of your way (only Canadians and American music nerds will get this joke, eh?)."}
{"text":"You have to try the BILLY MINERS PIE. it's soooooo good. A perfect balance of light chocolate & coffee. YUM!"}
{"text":"I stopped in with my coworkers for dinner on a suggestion by another coworker.

This place is a homerun! The restaurant has a really nice ambiance. Casual attire. The staff is attentive and friendly. The staff can handle parties of people as well as handling couples. There is adequate seating, booths, tables, bar area, not a bad place to be seated anywhere in this place. I like the fact that the front door is separated from the main dining area by a wall.

I had the Lobster Gratinee as my appetizer. Really tasty!! My main course was Pistachio crusted salmon with mashed potatoes over brussel sprouts. The waitress asked how I wanted my salmon prepared. Not just assume how I would like it. Our waitress was very fun and engaging with our table, that adds  to my rating of 5 stars! 

For dessert, I had the large Brownie Sundae. I would suggest the mini serving. The large is no joke! I finished it, but felt close to overly full. I definitely enjoyed my meal and dessert. There is a full bar as well as a nice wine list to choose from."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, service was superb. The back room was a terrible place to be seated. The sound bounced around the walls and we couldn't hear one another talking because it was so loud. Had heard such incredible things and while the food and service were both excellent, the lesson is never to be seated in that back room again."}
{"text":"My family and I had the best service last night at the Keg. Everyone who helped us was amazing--the hosts, sa's, food runners, and servers were great and made the night so special. Our server Cheyanne was exceptional. She helped us through the menu and wine pairings. Aside from that, she had an awesome sense of humor and a really sweet disposition which totally made our night. This was the second time we've had her as our server and will always try to request her. Thanks for the great night and the amazing food. Try the steak and cajun shrimp! So good. Definitely has a good kick if you like Cajun spices."}
{"text":"I love the keg and have been here several times. I have ordered everything from the Filet Mignon to the Teriyaki chicken, to a plain ol salad and have never been disappointed in the wait staff or my meal.

I gotta say the bread they give is AH-MAZ-ING. It comes out pipping hot fresh from the oven, covered in a black cloth to keep warm and sided with a delicious moose butter. I could fill up on their bread alone. In fact, I have asked for more bread to have with my meal and they brought it at no extra charge.

If you have a special request, they are always willing to accommodate. One time I went in, I wanted their mandarin cranberry walnut salad made into a dinner portion (not the small side one they have on the menu) and I wanted chicken on it. Not a problem. I have to say that is one of the best salads  I have been served at a restaurant. 

Their blue cheese Filet Mignon is outright RICH. With a side of those garlic mashed potatoes, it will send you over the top. I can't see how nayone can finish it.

The keg is also great with reservations and will take them even if its just you and 1 other person. The wait here can get a bit long if you show up after 630. I always make reservations to be better safe than hungry.

Like another yelper mentioned, this is not a Ruth's Chris steak house, this is the Keg. A notch under the best, but for the price and the great food, you can't beat it."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the steak here. Ordered the New York, it was $27 with potato and salad. I must say I was shocked at the quality of the steak. It was cooked (med rare) to perfection and had incredible flavor. I've paid 3 times as much for steaks that had nothing on this one. 

I was beyond pleasantly surprised and will definitely be back. My only complaint would be that the place is called The Keg yet their selection of beer wasn't what I expected."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to The Keg for our anniversary. The food was top notch. We had the prime rib and filet mignon, both medium rare, and they were perfect. All of the sides were delicious. The waiter was friendly and attentive, but not overbearing. 

The customer service was probably some of the best I've ever witnessed. The table next to us mentioned to their waiter that their steak was overdone. He immediately whisked it away, with lots of apologies, and promptly brought out a replacement. The manager soon came out to apologize and made sure the replacement was satisfactory. He then offered them a free dessert of their choice. 

To our surprise, our waiter brought out a complementary piece of mocha almond ice cream pie and congratulated us on our anniversary. We were sold. The food and service at this restaurant are 5 stars."}
{"text":"Another big thank you to this location of The Keg!  We had a reservation last night for about 20 people for my birthday dinner.  We needed to be finished within a certain time frame to make our second stop on time. We had wonderful servers and the manager on duty jumped in as needed to make sure we had excellent service and were in and out as requested. 

Our food was wonderful and perfectly prepped as always.  The staff was more than accommodating and the environment very pleasant. I am always blown away by the level of service in this location. All Keg locations have good food, but this one goes above and beyond when It comes to service."}
{"text":"Blah to the extreme. The McRib at McDonalds is more flavorful and priced much more economically.

I ordered the surf and turf special. Steak volume was decent but there was TWO scallops. Wanted to complain but... where's the waitress? 

It was also hard to cut my Medium-Rare steak with their DULL knives. Was like sawing through a brick with a chop stick. Boo!

PLUS it was irritating to wait for 40 minutes and then be seated in the far back... while passing dozens of empty tables along the way.

Thank goodness their liquid medication (martini) selection was decent. Maybe a good place for drinks??"}
{"text":"Business dinner at the keg. The place was hopping busy.  Ordered the shrimp cocktail calamari and baked cheese.  Overall nice flavors and good quality.  They talk about keg sized drinks but those did not add up for me. Asked for my filet to be medium rare and it was cooked medium well. Kinda disappointing as it looked like the beef was good. It was genuine Canadian usda prime beef.  Humm the USDA marking on Canadian beef threw me.  Prices were Ok and for a business dinner it met the need.   Not sure I would try again."}
{"text":"Bravo Claire!! You've completely changed my view of the keg. I've had a checkered past with the other locations in the east valley and you've changed my mind about the market place location.

You're suggestions we're amazing, I was pleasantly surprised with the Santa fe dip (but thanks now im on the hunt for the recipe). My husband loved the rib steak and it was cooked to PERFECTION matter of fact, so was my steak. 

Thank you so much for your service and kindness, im so impressed and will make the trip to Tempe over the other East valley locations."}
{"text":"Great friendly staff with great smiles. 

Sante fe chicken dip was delicious served warm with chips. 
Calamari keg style was a big disappointment.  Ringlets the size of wedding rings, causing portion to look like leftovers from bottom of bag. Informed young server and she said sorry, that's the size.  Server needs training on how to deal with clients response. 

Two pound lobster was perfect served with baked potato n portion of veggies
Manhattan lobster steak served with garlic mash.  Lobster sauce was nice. Steak tender n well aged."}
{"text":"Amazing! 
From the moment I walked into the door I was greeted by the Hostess with a very warm smile and immediately you felt that you were in a great place. Our waiter was genuine and was happy to answer any questions that we had about the menu. He was very knowledgeable of the wine selection helping me to pick a wine to my exact liking. Never have I been so impressed with the service provided to me. Towards the end of our dinner I asked to speak the manager to offer all our compliments that we had for the the service we received. The manager received our compliments genuinely and we could tell that he was thankful for hearing everything we had to say. 
The food was great. I could not have asked for more. The quality and taste of everything we had made me think that we were paying way too less. Overall, I can say that i will be returning to the Keg as often I possibly can and would recommend this establishment to anyone!"}
{"text":"Came in with a group of 6 to celebrate my birthday.  The hottest greeted us right away and offered us to grab one of their drink specials (daily 5.00 specialty drinks) at the bar while our table was being set up.  We did have a reservation and I highly recommend you make one on a Friday night as they are pretty busy at this location.  Once we were seated, the hottest brought us water and took our drink and appetizer orders.  All the food we ordered came out pretty quick and soon after our dinner plates.  I had a steak, medium cooked with a potato and it was pretty good and tender, flavoring was perfect.  Not too salty or under seasoned.  Great atmosphere, lighting is dimmed at night.  A few other parties were there that evening and were pretty loud, if your looking for a quiet dinner, Friday night is probably not a good idea.  We didn't mind it one bit since we were a group as well.  I will be coming back to try other items on the menu.  The servings are pretty filling, make sure you have an appetite."}
{"text":"This Keg was just ok.  My wife and I orderred the steak and lobster tail.  The steak was fantastic.  But, The Lobster tail was tasteless and rubbery.  Big disappointment.  And for the price I paid, I expected better."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed eating here with my family. We were here to celebrate my brother's birthday as well as mine for the month of November. We came in a few minutes early and was able to be seated right away since we had a reservation although I don't think it would have been an issue as it wasn't too packed when we got here.

We got seated at a booth and it was not long before our waiter came by to get us waters and said he would come back in a few minutes to let us decide what we wanted. He told us about a special they had going on tonight for $34.99 with a Cajun shrimp medley that had regular sized shrimps and 2 tiger shrimps, an 8 oz. top sirloin steak, green beans and red peppers, along with our choice of accompaniment. My father, brother, and myself got this special with a twice baked potato, mixed vegetables, and mashed potatoes, respectively. I got my steak medium rare and it was cooked to perfection. I couldn't finish the steak so I got it packed up. My mother got the 6 oz. top sirloin with green beans, red peppers, and a twice baked potato ($23).

While we were waiting for our entrees, the waiter brought over complimentary piping hot bread with whipped butter which was fantastic. I also ordered a glass of red wine and my brother got an old fashioned which was made well (both $13), and my parents both got a Pepsi each ($3).

Overall I would come here for a special occasion in the future for sure since it was a tad bid pricey ($172.89 for the four of us). The service was wonderful and ambiance was perfect."}
{"text":"I have been to the Keg many times before but not this location.  I tried taking my wife to the Keg Mansion as this was her first time in Toronto and wanted her to be able to see the mansion and the cool ambiance there.  Unfortunately, they were having ventilation issues and weren't serving dinner until they were repaired and guessed at a long wait.  We were staying out towards Mississauga so figured we'd just go to the one by the hotel.  What a mistake that was.  We arrived around 6:00 PM and decided we'd wait the 30-40 minutes they quoted.  We finally were seated and the waitress came over and for whatever reason immediately had an attitude with us.

She told us about the daily specials and then let us know the temperature of their prime rib and how wonderful it was.  Took almost ten minutes just to get our drinks, no bread brought to the table.  When she finally came back after another ten minutes to take our order, we ordered the prime rib.  She immediately said that they had just run out of prime rib and she'd be back in a bit to let us look at the menu for a different choice.  

We closely watched the couple at the table just over from us where they were sat after us but had their bread and drinks and then she told them how wonderful the prime rib was after telling us that they were out.

We decided to just get up and leave.  Asked for the manager on the way out and let him know what had happened.  Though he did apologize and offered to seat us in another section to show how they normally treat customers, we were done.  Wound up down the street at a place called Chop and had an incredible experience there."}
{"text":"Server Madison, great.
Pinot noir, great.

Prime rib bland.
Grilled shrimp tasted like a gas grill.

Should have said something while at the restaurant but of course I didn't so I called once I left tonight. The manger Chris was absolutely unpleasant. I will never return."}
{"text":"I would have given this place one star if it wasn't for the bartender Suzi. This place has the ambiance to be a pretty nice place. The wait staff is super cool and it has a good vibe. As far as what they are \"known for\" STEAK. Thumbs down! I ordered a bone in rib steak and waited over 30 min. Suzi let me know towards the end that there was a party that put in a large order and that's why it took so long. Thanks for the heads up, but the kitchen is well prepared enough to handle Wednesday night dinner traffic. My steak finally came and it was over cooked (medium well to we'll done) and I ordered medium. The veggies were soggie and bland and the mushrooms had zero flavor. I know mistakes happen, but the chefs/cooks in the back have to take more pride in what they are doing when serving food at mid-upper tier pricing. Again, my experience with the front line staff was awesome, Suzi definitely did her job, and did it well. However, the back of the house needs some work."}
{"text":"Probably should be a 3.5.  Last time I was there was restaurant week.  Food was good, but Firebirds was better.  Wait times here can be long.."}
{"text":"There's a Seinfeld episode where the gang attempts to eat at chinese restaurant.  They give their name to the host and are then told it will just be a few moments.  As time goes by people who come in after them are seated.  They ask the host again how long it will be and are told it will just be a few moments.  At the end of the day they leave the restaurant without eating and in the closing scene of the show, after they've left, the host calls their name.

While my experience at the Keg was not exactly the same, it was similar enough that my jaws tightened down so hard that I had to leave before eating.

So what happened?

Walkin and put my name on the list.  I'm told it will just be a few moments as they prepare the table.  Ok no problem.

I sit, I wait.  People come in after me.  The folks after me (same size party, no reservation) are seated.  I ask the hostess what's up.  Oh we're preparing your table.

Another group after me (no reservation) is seated.  I didn't bother to ask what's up.

Finally, they say our table is ready.  We walk back to the far end of the restaurant only to find they want to seat us at a table large enough to seat an offensive line of an NFL team.  I needed space for three...not three hundred.  We ask about the table behind us...a four top.  Oh...you have to go back to the hostess station while we sort it out.  

WTF!!!!!  My jaw is so tight its starting to hurt and I'm about to achieve orbital velocity.  I've got to leave or I'm going to pop.  I pass the hostess station, hit the door and keep on going.

Now, the place isn't that crowded (its before 5:00 PM.  But for some reason we can't accommodate a simple request without going to the front of the restaurant.   WFT...again????

The food my be good here, but I don't know and I won't ever know.

A zero is appropriate here but that's not a choice."}
{"text":"We ate dinner at the bar. The food was great. I am not a steak fan, so I had a small salad for dinner and a lot of beer while my friends ordered a big steak It was a big place but I really liked how I still felt cozy inside. I would highly recommend thi place for a business dinner."}
{"text":"Really disappointed.  It was our anniversary dinner (12 years yay!), we ate out on the patio.  The atmosphere was very nice, wonderful weather, quiet, enjoyable in that respect.  However, I ordered the prime rib and prawns, and my husband ordered the ribeye.  He said his ribeye was good, but no better than Texas Roadhouse.  It said it was served with rice pilaf, which it wasn't it was wild rice.  My prime rib was horribly overcooked and dry, although had nice flavor, and my prawns were undercooked, but again good flavor.  I did eat the prawns the way they were, but could not choke down the steak being so over done, so I said something.  One of our waitresses (we were passed back and forth between 3), siad she'd get me a new one.  They did bring a new one which was cooked correctly, however it was still dry and this one had no flavor at all.  I don't EVER spend $30 on an entree for myself and was very disappointed that this was such a let down after so many friends had raved over it.  Our calamari appetizer was good.  Our drinks were only refilled once and glasses sat empty for a good long time.  After the prime rib was replaced, that was that, nothing off the tab, no apology, no dessert on the house, NOTHING.  

For what we paid, the food was just okay and definitely not worth the high price tag by any means.  I doubt we will return in the future.  The only reason I would choose here over something like Texas Roadhouse would be the atmosphere, but even at that, I far prefer better food at a better price with better service over atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great date night spot. Bit pricey but food was good and service was nice. Lobster bisque was yummy. Blackened sirloin was flavorful and I would order it again. Steak comes with a side which is nice for the price. I would definitely return again. I enjoyed my meal and dining experience."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to a Keg. As far as ambiance goes, it was great. The wait staff was attentive, and must have all been models because it was probably the best looking staff I have ever seen in a restaurant. 

That being said, the most I can give this place for the meal I had is 3 stars.  I had the keg burger, and my buddy had the 7 oz. filet.

He said his was good. Mine, not so much.  The menu description sounded fantastic, and our server recommended it to me. I ordered it with a side of asparagus. 

When the plate arrived, the server presented it on what appeared to be a hot plate (he used a cloth napkin as a hot mitt) so I was excited. Well, the asparagus was cold to start. The burger was slapped onto a cold, straight-outta-the-wrapper bun.  I can get the same buns at a local supermarket.  It was not warmed, steamed, toasted, anything.  

The burger was a delicious sounding combination of meats, however lacked much flavor when executed. The flavor balance of the whole thing was thrown off by the quantity of strong pickles added on top of and underneath my burger.

It wasn't horrible, just underwhelming considering all the reviews.  Bottom line for me is that I don't think I would go back for dinner. I may go back to have a drink or two at the bar, people watch, and watch a game."}
{"text":"We come to the Keg at least twice a year - for my birthday and my husband's birthday.  We always get the free dinner coupon via email.  Their food is always delicious.  We ordered the prime rib combination dinner:  10 oz prime rib, garlic mashed potatoes and veggies (zucchini, bell peppers and mushrooms) - medium rare.  It was good as always. We also ordered the mushrooms neptune for an appetizer and it was really good.  It came with 2 rolls to seep in any leftover juices from the mushroom sauce.  We also ordered the calamari which came out looking really sad.  It was scarce mixed in with some fried bell peppers and fried slices of jalapenos.  It seemed overcooked and had been sitting under the heating lamp for a while.  We let the manager know, who happened to be walking past our table and he quickly apologized and offered to bring us another appetizer - he suggested the bacon wrapped scallops.  When those came out, they were hot and tasted really good.  When the bill came, we saw that Chaz (manager) had taken off the calamari and comp'd us the bacon wrapped scallops.  That was really kind of him. 

Overall, the service was great, our server was very accommodating and prompt.  She was super friendly.  I also like the \"kids\" plate that they bring out at the beginning with slices of oranges, crackers and celery.  My son enjoyed that.  We'll definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"Great service, love the upstairs patio. Appetizers are always delicious. Great wine suggestions. Staff is accommodating on patio as sun shifts and spots get too hot or too bright. Always clean. I always have a great time - have gone for work and fun. 

Love the apps and drinks. Be careful ladies, if you are in heels and drinking, the stairs can be dangerous! Lol

Note there is a TV on upstairs patio so you can enjoy the sun and fresh air and still catch the game.

Ok this worthy of an update. They have sliders as an appetizer and they are delicious!

I will also say that I like steak medium well and I have problems with most places cooking it enough. At The Keg they always get it right for me.

They have even butterflied some cuts for me, ensuring that they cooked it enough for me without making it tough.

They have a great sparkling wine, I'll have to go back and have more and then I can update this with the name!"}
{"text":"When it's time for a great dinner out and $ is not a question, we go to The Keg.  Service and food are excellent.   the only thing I would change if I could would be to make it less expensive so I could afford to go there more often.

I can't decide which is better there, the food, or the attractive ladies involved in serving it.  I can tell you that they are not an 'equal opportunity employer\" and I appreciate that.  

If I could change anything about the restuarant, it would need to be a quieter facility.  However, I'm there for the food, so I tend not to notice the noise."}
{"text":"I called this location before they opened to ask if I could place a to go order today, Valentine's Day, to surprise my hubby with a candlelight dinner at home. They told me to call back when they open and it'd be no problem. When I called back they told me they don't do to go orders on holidays. I explained that I had called earlier and they had said to call back. Maria was so accommodating and let me place the order anyways. Thank you so much Maria for your amazing customer service and helping make our Valentine's Day happen :)"}
{"text":"The. Best. Steakhouse. In town. Hands down. I've been to both the desert ridge location and Tempe location and both were outstanding. In service and food! I'm extremely picky about steaks and how they're cooked. Medium Rare seems to mean something very different between restaurants, but The Keg gets it perfect every time. It beats Ruth Christs, Firebirds, Texas Roadhouse, Houstons, Fleming's. Durant's is the only one in close comparison. They also brought out champagne when they heard it was our anniversary. So sweet."}
{"text":"I was not expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised
 We went there after my son recommended it and I am happy we did.
 Service was great, I love it when servers help each other out and run food so the customers get good service.
 The steaks were tender and delicious.  Portions were generous.  And the brownie sundae is decadent."}
{"text":"They really went all out for my daughters graduation dinner!
  They had a sweet handwritten congratulatory note on the table and gave us a free decadent desert on the house.  Not many places give that kind of special treatment anymore.
  Our server was terrific. Not too intrusive, but he was right there when we needed him.
OK, the food.  AMAZING!
  We each had a different type of steak and done to different degrees and all came out perfectly!
  My daughters boyfriend wanted his NY strip \"Blue\" or \"Chicago style\" - I had never heard of either of those, but the server did.  They talked a bit back and forth and he raved about how perfect it was and that this is only the second place in Phoenix who got it right.
  My well done was well done, my daughters med rare was med rare, hubbies medium well was medium well.
  Our server suggested the 3 cheese butter for my potato and I ended up slathering it all over the steak it was decadent!"}
{"text":"We came here for thanksgiving dinner last night (too lazy to cook here). This restaurant is beautifully decorated and they were definitely busy. Hostess was friendly and even greed us on our way out. I thought that was great. Our waitress knew the menu very well and checked in with us very often for refill. The manager stopped by just to make sure we enjoyed our service and meals. Their overall service is definitely top notch and as good as Durant's. 

They offered a thanksgiving 3 course meal even though I didn't pick it. I thought that was awesome. Since this restaurant is known for their steaks, I ordered a 10oz prime rib (medium rare) with twice baked potatoes as my side. Their prime rib is tender but a bit dry. Overall I still like it. Their twice baked potatoes is absolutely delicious. If I wasn't so full, I would have finished the whole thing. 

Overall, I think this restaurant is wonderful. I will definitely come back here again to try something else."}
{"text":"The Keg is the best chain steakhouse out there.  Yes, I believe it offers better tasting main dishes and side dishes than Ruth's Chris, Morton's, etc.  

Please don't let the chain label negatively influence your decision to eat at this fine establishment.  The service is impeccable.  I can't think of an instance where I haven't been treated amazingly well by the staff.  From the hostess to the server, you'll feel like you're the only guest(s) being tended to.  Additionally, the decor is beautifully understated, with low light and dark wood throughout the dining area.  

I've had the bacon wrapped filet and it was succulent and delectable and cooked to my liking.  The prime rib....fuggedaboutit!!!  I was told by our server that they have a 24OZ selection that is not listed on the menu, so I immediately ordered it.  It was the size of a human thigh, but oh so amazingly tasty (OK, maybe human thigh meat is tasty too??)  The Keg's horseradish sauce is amazingly hot and I love it.  Their Au Jus is also very tasty, but I pay most of my attention to that HOT horseradish sauce. Their Mushrooms Neptune are exceptional and stand on equal footing with any other higher end restaurant's best appetizer.  The baked brie is also wonderful and the staples like the shrimp cocktail and baked garlic shrimp are also flavorful.

If you're craving a steak and can afford to spend a little more than places like Outback, stop on over and enjoy high end tasting steaks at considerably lower than high end prices

**Tip 1**

Steakhouses are by definition pricey.  Sign up for the Keg's Birthday Club and get $25 towards your meal price every year you're alive!

**Tip 2**

Happy hour runs 4PM-7PM M-F and offers some discounted appetizer and drink prices, so save yourself a couple of extra bucks."}
{"text":"I've been here several times with my aunt and friends.  I love how the offer a shrimp cocktail appetizer to anyone that hasn't been there before!  It's a very cool idea!  I avoided trying this place for a while because of the 'chain' factor, but every Keg is truly different.  The decor is great and the menu will satisfy any and everyone!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent and the service was great! Probably one of the better Keg locations we've been to"}
{"text":"We have been to the Keg at San Tan several times and have always enjoyed it. Went there a few weeks ago for my birthday and there was a slight issue with my steak being overcooked. I ordered it medium rare, our waiter thought I said medium well. 

They could not have been more accommodating, they replaced the steak and brought out one that was cooked to absolute perfection. Our waiter was top notch, admitted the mistake and took care of it with precision. The manager on duty made sure that we were happy and went above and beyond. We'll be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Best customer service from our waiter, who was very personable, friendly and had insightful knowledge and opinions about the dinner menu. We have only been once for a special occasion and this made it a real treat! Food was pretty good, and entrees were priced for a ritzier restaurant but we offset that with a gift card. $80-100 and over on average for a steak dinner for two with drinks and appetizers is what you would be expecting to pay."}
{"text":"This place is something that I can't point my finger on.  The place on the outside doesn't look appealing.  When you walk in, the ambiance is nice and it's beautifully set.  I like the decor.  They had servers that were scantily clad but not in the Hooter's type of way. More of a short shorts and low cut tops. Great for anyone that likes that, but I'm not that \"anyone\" in that boat.  These servers were good, but the way they were dressed wasn't really fitting for the restaurant. 

We were a party of about 15 and the servers were on their game.  I ordered a Keg's Classic Filet Mignon and it came with quite a bit of food.  I asked specifically for no bacon, because they said they wrap it in bacon, well it was wrapped in bacon. Wha wha. I just removed it and ate the steak, because I don't eat pork (something I told the server). 

The rest of the food was good, and I ate it all. I then ordered dessert, creme brûlée. Well, that had hair in it. Wha wha. The manager came by and comped my wine as an \"I'm sorry\". It was a nice gesture. Everyone else had a great meal but me, and I was already having a bad day. :/ oh well. At least management took care of the wine. I sure as heck needed it."}
