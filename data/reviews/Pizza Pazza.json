{"text":"I love this place! I grew up down the street - its a great neighbourhood place. Whenever I visit Toronto, I always visit. The bruschetta is to die for. I also love the gnocci and pizza."}
{"text":"This place needs to get their act together. Flavors are off. Tomato sauce needs some help, same for flavor of fillings in pasta. Quite a disappointment. The place looks nice and hip, but food is not good. Service is OK, nothing special. No need to come back."}
{"text":"Never disappointed with this place.  Have been going there for decades, even after ownership changes, their food has stayed consistent, generous and never disappoints."}
