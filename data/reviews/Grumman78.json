{"text":"I've had the tacos from the truck a few times and also tried them at Nouveau Palais and the new spot doesn't diverge at all from what they usually offer. I had the \"turkey dinner\" taco, served with gravy and cranberry jelly and it was absolutely delicious. I wasn't so lucky with the \"pork stick\" taco though. The porc portion was a deep fried pork croquette, which sounds good in theory, but there was hardly any actual meat in it. In fact, the filling was mostly huge chunks of mushy pork fat (maybe I was unlucky, but this was inedible). I ended up simply removing the pork and eating the taco with just the condiments. Disappointing. I also ordered the hibiscus tea in a \"sip sac\" (juice in a bag) for 2$. It was a bit sweet for me, but with a bit of added vodka, it would have been awesome. Speaking of their liquor license, they're trying to get one and have gotten the green light from the liquor board, but the Faubourg says no for liability reasons. Hopefully they'll be able to figure it out. Total price for two tacos and a drinks, tax in: $11.50."}
{"text":"Amazing food, ambiance and service. 
We tried almost everything.... The onion ring appetizer was the bomb."}
{"text":"Porc Banh Mi, Papas Grumman et Horchata; Succulent et frais! Un must à Montréal..."}
{"text":"Ate here a few nights ago and the food was awesome. The summer menu is delicious. Their grilled endive salad, zucchini tacos and the taco of the month made with octopus were all fantastic. We also had their smoked mackerel rillette, a special for the night and it was tasty. Service was attentive and the casual family atmophere was inviting. They always have a great wine list with reasonably priced options, it's a well thought out list. 

Its nice when restaurants change up their menu, it makes it fun for returning customers and for the kitchen, keeps their jobs exciting and keeps it interesting for the customers palate."}
{"text":"I have one of my Grumman 78 staples whenever available, their fried chicken and potato salad. I'm not going to tell you that their fried chicken is probably right up there with some of the best out, because I'm going to let YOU tell ME that. Prepared in a two-step process, the chicken is treated to a nice warm vacuumed packed jacuzzi bath for a couple of hours then battered and deep fried. Coming out of the sous-vide like a fat lady from a sauna, the chicken is cooked while retaining all its natural moisture which assures a juicy and tender, fall-off-the-bone bite after it's been deep fried in a seasoned batter. The potato salad is not to be overlooked. Perfectly cooked potatoes with a snap to each bite, smothered in a tangy dressing, celery, and onion, is a great accompaniment to the fried chicken, adding texture and a bright note to the dish."}
{"text":"I am not sure if I like or dislike this place. I will make a list of cons and pros:

PROS:
- Some dishes are delicious
- The \"Papas Grumman\" are really yummy
- Place is very cool inside, lots of space
- They usually have the hockey games on if you like that
- Drinks are very good
- Easy to get a reservation last minute
CONS:
- The chairs and pallet tables look cool but they are the most uncomfortable thing to sit on.
- The \"Papas Grumman\" make me feel like crap every time I eat them. But I think they're worth it.
- Service is really slow when the place is packed.
- I find that every time I go and order something they just ran out of it."}
{"text":"the decor is nice, the papas side (roasted sweet potatoes with cheese and cilantro) were amazing, but I was extremely underwhelmed by the steak tacos. the meat, while cooked perfectly, just wasn't tender enough to be bitten into, and it was a messy eat. the taste was just plain meh as well. It came served in a tortilla with some mashed potato, a strip of skirt steak, and a fistful of greens and onions on top. now, I'm not a fan of Texmex/3 amigos-type \"americanized\" Mexican food, but this wasn't the real deal either.

the dessert was great, my date and I shared the lemon coconut pie and the chocolate bourbon panna cotta (EXTREMELY rich and decadent), and I have nothing bad to say about the service. our waiter was great, and while we did wait about half an hour for our meal, it was a busy night so I won't deduct any points there. 

if you're not a picky eater and don't mind the steep price, then you'll enjoy this place."}
{"text":"If you've been looking around for the bright green Grumman78 taco truck, good news: they have just opened a stand at the Faubourg Sainte-Catherine and are a welcome addition to the Faubourg's food court. Let's hope they are here to stay! (And let's hope Montreal's antiquated by-laws prohibiting street food are revised because this city needs to get with it and allow street food vendors like lots of other cities worldwide.)  

Today was my first time trying a Grumman78 taco. I had the Pork Banh Mi and it was really fresh and delicious. I look forward to trying their other creations. I'm taking one star off because the prices are a bit expensive for a four-bite -- or maybe three big bites -- taco (they are minimum $4+tax for just one)."}
{"text":"Weird location but the food is great! The setup is unique. Just a mishmash of art, tables, chairs. You can see right in the kitchen. Worth it 100%."}
{"text":"Small but tasty gourmet tacos. We tried the Porc Banh Mi (typical mild vietnamese flavor) and Boeuf Ancho (basically a burrito of beans and meat). 

There is no two ways around it; this is petite food. At $5-6 dollars a taco you will probably want to buy two for lunch. The staff wavered between nice and uninterested, but I'm willing to give them a pass under such intense summer food truck conditions.

The major caveat I'd give is pretty simple: the food I tasted was not extraordinary. If you really want a taco/burrito, there are better options (M4!). But in a food truck environment  they provide a tasty lunch option that nobody else in Montreal provides."}
{"text":"Tacos, tacos, tacos.  We are pretty far from the land where tacos originated from, but Grumman78 serves up some interesting mixes of tacos.  I have seen them around at festivals, but due to Montreal's antiquated street food laws they cant operate as a true food truck which is a phenomenon sweeping the majority of cities in the US.  Such a shame, but I digress.

However, they opened up a location in the Faubourg so I tried me some tacos.  First off, they are a bit expensive but are kind of filling, so maybe it makes up for that?  Anyways, my favorite is the pork bahn mi (sp?).  It has pulled pork and Asian slaw with some cilantro which definitely increases the flavor.  

Some of them are WAY overpriced like the chorizo and crab taco.  Wasn't worth the 8 dollars at all.  It's just chorizo and crab meat...really not much flavor.

They also have some sides, like the sweet potato fries.  They also offer juices in plastic bags, which I haven't tried yet.

It's a tad expensive, but good and a very welcome addition to the Faubourg food court."}

{"text":"Voici un foodtruck que j'ai découvert la fin de semaine dernière. Je n'ai pas essayé leurs fameux tacos, mais plutôt leur cheese cake à la rhubarbe et leur jus à l'hibiscus.

Le jus était bon et servi dans un sac en plastique avec une paille (peu pratique lorsqu'on essaie de le poser quelque part, mais très divertissant).  Le goût était bon, mais beaucoup trop sucré!

Pour ce qui est du cheese cake, j'ai été bien déçue quand j'ai vu sa grosseur (ou devrais-je dire sa petitesse!). Pour le prix, je m'attendais à un peu plus gros... Puis, j'ai pris ma première bouchée et j'ai finalement été bien satisfaite! Il est onctueux à souhait! 

Bref, j'y retournerai peut-être, mais jusqu'à maintenant, ce n'est pas mon coup de coeur."}
{"text":"I heard a lot about Grunman and as it is in my hood I thought  I would check it out.  First off, it isn't very vegetarian friendly, there is only one thing on the menu to choose from: beans on taco. As I can get something similar, more tasty, more authentic, for less in central american or south american places, you simply are disappointed. 
So I didn't try any of the other tacos on the menu (duck, fish, whatever else).  Grunman seems to focus on the local meat stuff.
We tried the dulce de leche desert, the staff recommended it, but it was plain and heavy.
In sum, this place is over hyped and over priced."}
{"text":"I heard so much about this place and when my friends informed me about the reservation they made on Saturday, i was excited. 

When you enter the place, you see that the concept is a garage, where the windows are actually the entrance. 
The tables are made of wood, and you feel like sitting in a wooden cabano.

I asked the waiter to tell me about their drinks speciality. He suggested the margarita. I did have a lot of margarita in my life, and this one was such a desapointment. 
It comes in a tiny glass with tones of icecubes. The taste was diluted.

For the food, we had the salmon dynamite, that I recommend.
We also had tasteless carnitas and steak tacos. The first one is shredded porc with avocado and the second is diced steak with mushroom and chimichurri. 

Finally for the desert we got a cake since it was the birthday of our friend. 
They charged each guest 2.5$ for the service !

I definitly dont recommend this place for mexican food, but if you are in the area you can try their salmon dynamite."}
{"text":"We have been twice to this restaurant. The first time I would have given them a higher rating. The menu is limited and seems to be evolving into a \"Mexican Tapas\" place. While this may work for their food truck it doesn't seem to work as well in the restaurant. The food is tasty however not outstanding.  There are other better choices in the area. Service was spotty. The Waitress seemed to have too many tables on the second visit."}
{"text":"I went here recently with a homie before a movie date because time was tight and well, because tacos are most people's best friend. That and dogs apparently. I love Mehhhican food and I honestly think it's hard to come by in Monty. After all, Canada isn't exactly south of the border, folks. So, we hit up Grumman78...and despite the absolutely dismal surroundings (it's in a bit of sketchy looking/vibing mini-mall), we ordered some jerk chicken tacos and had a seat...in a plastic cafeteria chair of course. Very classy date. Although the surroundings were a huge thumbs down, the tacos were niiiice..but, tiny. You need to order at least 10 (not really) and since they are 4 bucks each, it really shouldn't break the piggy bank. As an after food thought, I ordered the sweet potato fries, which ended up swimming in a sea of oil (I think the captain was asleep at the wheel and the sailors had taken over the ship), and were topped with feta...? I can't remember really. I must have been drunk...or just wanted to be. So, while I probably won't return to the gorgeous mini-mall to hit up Grumman's for some taco treats, I'll most likely seek out the food truck this summer...after all, tacos just taste better...in the daylight...with a Corona in hand. Si?"}
{"text":"Love their fish tacos!! .. oh, and that tomato salad is beyond!!  One of Montreal's little hidden gems!"}
{"text":"Hipster tacos, always my favourite. I've had their amazing Banh Mi tacos from the food truck over the years, but finally went to the restaurant for my anniversary the other day and was blown away. The ambiance was great. Beautiful xmas lights and classic rock/ soul music playing. Our dinner was unsurprisingly outstanding: Filet Mignon tacos, Fried Catfish tacos, fried chicken (whoa), and sweet potato poutine."}
{"text":"Guess I wasn't prepared for this place. I got excited when I saw that there was a taco truck just around the corner from my neighborhood and decided to cruise down to give it a try. For the record, tacos are my favorite food, and I am a taco snob.

When I went inside the restaurant I immediately said \"What the fuck?\" Not what I was expecting at all. I was totally under-dressed and felt waaaay out of place. I decided to stick around to try some tacos. I took a seat at the bar and ordered carnitas tacos ($20). Well, someone needs to explain to the chef what carnitas actually are. I was served lamb tacos. Why not just write \"lamb tacos\" on the chalk board instead of calling it carnitas, which everyone knows is pork. Weird.

The tacos were okay. At three for twenty dollars it should have come with a massive side, or be ten tacos at two dollars each. Considering they used generic corn tortillas and just a couple small bits of meat, my small portion twenty dollar meal probably cost them 3 dollars to make. 

Maybe prices are better when the taco truck is running?"}
{"text":"Grumman permanently closed up shop at Faubourg when they found that the building was infested with cockroaches and the landlord wasn't doing anything about it. Luckily for us they have opened their HQ to the public 3 nights a week (Wed to Fri from 6 PM). 

The local is industrial chic with lights strung from the rafters and all the tables made from recycled pallets. The sit down setup gives them an opportunity to expand and get even more creative with their menu. The team site Toqué, Au Pied de Cochon, L'Express and McKiernan's on their resumes and although the atmosphere at Grumman is far different the the quality of the food keeps up with the best establishments in Montreal. 

The taco plates are made for sharing and ordering one per person is defiantly overkill. The entrées  which are described as 'individual portions' are very generous and, in most cases, great for sharing. 

The Salmon cru and Taco Truck corn on the cob (not so great for sharing) are excellent. As a non-eater of meat I'm a bit limited in my selection although I'm certain that the 'Buffalo Bits' salad must rock, it just sounds so good. My fav is the calamari and kimchi tacos. I know this does not sound like a combo that would work, but it is pure genius. Open up you're BBQ Chicken bag, that's where your taco shells are, and pile on all these seemingly uncooperative toppings and all of a sudden their is an party going on in your mouth! 

The only downside is that they are only open 3 nights a week. Reservations are suggested."}
{"text":"Aménagé dans un entrepôt, les locaux du Grumman'78 sont vraiment exceptionnels! Le décors et l'ambiance est très unique, décontracté et tire beaucoup sur le côté hipster (on peut y jouer un partie de Pac-Man Arcade en attendant sa table...). 
La nourriture était vraiment bonne et goûteuse, un peu lourd, mais c'est probablement parce qu'on veut goûter à tout et qu'on à trop manger.
C'est un endroit pour partager la bouffe en groupe et les plat sont mis au centre de la place, à la disposition de tous. Ce qui donne comme résultat que:
1-On ne peut pas vraiment y aller à 2 parce que vous aller manger une seule assiette à deux, donc vous ne goûterez pas grand chose sur le menu.
2-Si on y va en groupe (comme c'était le cas pour l'anniversaire de mon ami, on était 10) c'est un CAUCHEMARD au moment de payer!!
Que ce soit par paresse ou bien pour accentuer le niveau de \"partage\" du repas, il n'y à qu'une seul facture pour la table au complet, qui comprend la nourriture et l'alcool, et vous vous débrouiller avec. Donc tout le monde sort son iPhone pour calculer la part du couple qui à prit une bouteille de vin et un apéro, l'autre qui à prit 2 bières et l'autre qui ne boit pas et comment partager tout ça en bout de ligne pendant que le serveur nous regarde avec ça machine à carte de crédit dans ses mains pour le chanceux qui aura l'honneur de la lui donner.

Es-ce que j'y retourne? Non... Si je veux faire des math, je vais rester au bureau. Mais je vais y casser la croûte sans hésiter quand je vais voir leur camion sur mon chemin parce que leur tacos sont vraiment excellent!"}

The food is solid and affordable, and service is excellent. The last time I went with my husband we ordered the dynamite salmon (very good), lamb kebabs (good), fried chicken (very good), porc tacos and patates. The patates are amazing!! My favourite dish. With a shared dessert and a couple drinks our bill was $180. So not a cheap dinner but not crazy expensive either.  7.5/10"}
{"text":"Outstanding. Finally some great \"Mexican\" food downtown! The pork tacos are amazing. And the hibiscus juice out of a bag... Wonderful."}
{"text":"Good food, and very cool atmosphere, but the service is what put it over the top.  My girlfriend and I were seated next to a large birthday group on a Saturday night. As people at the large table were standing up to leave they repeatedly came uncomfortably close to our table, standing right next to us as we're eating. Both the hostess and the server noticed right away and first offered to seat us at another table, then offered us a complimentary dessert. That's how you do good service. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very fun. The food is extremely creative and memorable and some of it is quite exotic.  The service is also fantastic and friendly.  We had an assortment of different plates to try as much as we can and the horse tarare and whelk quesadillas were especially memorable.  Desert plate was also very tasty."}
{"text":"Taco?  Okay! Taco, okay.

While food trucks keep fighting the good fight to get themselves established in Canadian cities, places like Grumman are finding more permanent temporary solutions.

Grumman opened up a location at the infamously dirty Faubourg.  It just so happened I was heading there for some Thai.

My sister and I decided to check out the tacos because we've read the hype and heard all fuss.

Note that I love me a proper taco.  A really good taco makes me throw down of these !

Grumman's taco got a .

That's exactly what it was like.  I felt oooohh!!!! leading up to it, took a bite and went oh.

It was good but it was by no means special.  I may  have liked it better if it wasn't so pricey.  I may have liked it better if I hadn't tried BMB in Toronto recently.  I may have liked it better if I didn't compare it to Grand Electric's tacos.  That's one too many \"I may haves\" to chew on.

We tried the beef belly taco ($5) and their best-selling pork banh mi taco ($4).  Both were overflowing with flavour and meat, but it was all too anticlimactic.

I liked it, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat it.

Call me cheap, but the two tacos, no matter how generously stuffed they were, didn't make me forget I spent $10!  

Right punctuation, wrong thing to accentuate."}
{"text":"For food truck- 

Ok tasting gourmet, non traditional tacos. WAY overpriced. I paid 15$ for 2 tacos after tip and was left hungry. I will never eat here again, knowing that a ton of taquerias have opened, serving amazing mexican tacos for a fraction of the price. Very disappointing, but not surprising considering it's a Montreal food truck ($$$$)."}
{"text":"Le grumman est LE meilleure endroit au Québec pour manger des tacos selon moi ! Dans un décore unique, ce restaurant de st-henri est l'endroit parfait pour prendre un biere entre amis et manger des tacos en quantités industriels ! 

Le service est vraiment toujoura très bien et la bière n'est pas trop dispendieuse ! 

Un spot essentiel a essayer à montreal  !!"}
{"text":"Amazing service, the staff smiles!!!!! Quality Service is very important to me and dying in this city. Their spicy salmon dynamite is to die for ... We always get it when we go. Ambiance is perfection in the summer. You feel like you're in Soho NYC."}
{"text":"Quelle belle découverte!
J'avais déjà vu à plusieurs reprises le camion Grumman lors de festivals l'été, sans y porter grande attention. Des tacos? Boff... Jusqu'à ce qu'une de mes amies me suggère d'aller passer la soirée au Grumman sur de Courcelle. En voyant les photos sur Internet je ne savais pas trop à quoi m'attendre, mais quelle surprise, wow!

On entre dans un endroit chaleureux au décor éclectique. Le restaurant est plutôt grand. Le personnel est attentionné et accueillant. Notre serveuse était hyper sympathique et a pris le temps de nous parler du menu (qui change chaque semaine, d'ailleurs)! Tout avais évidemment l'air délicieux, mais la description du menu est incomparable à ce que les plats étaient vraiment. Les tacos \" réinventés \" sont faits d'ingrédients frais et sont tout à fait surprenants. Nous avons pris plusieurs plats et les avons partagés; j'ai adoré tout ce que nous avons commandé.

Seul point négatif : Impossible d'avoir ma propre facture, tous les plats et les boissons consommés par les clients à la table sont additionnés sur la même facture. Un peu \" plate \" de devoir tout démêler ça en sortant, surtout pour les plus gros groupes.

J'y suis allée durant l'hiver, mais j'ai bien hâte d'y retourner l'été!"}
{"text":"GREAT Lamb and Pork Banh Mi Tacos, not so great price. Although everything is fresh and flavourful, paying $7 for that one little taco sitting in the palm of your hand just kills me. I'd do it once a year at the Jazz Festival or something, but that's about it. Their hibiscus juice in a bag is not too shabby, a mix of sour and sweet. It's a really creative and interesting way to enjoy a drink, although I can totally foresee various ways of it getting messy."}
{"text":"Franchement, je ne comprends pas les critiques négatives. Les prix sont raisonnables (8$ un taco), grosses portions, service rapide. Pas huileux du tout contrairement à ce qu'on peut lire. Mon taco au boeuf ancho était délicieux, l'ambiance agréable, service rapide. Gros coup de coeur."}
{"text":"Truly love this spot and it's another great addition to our rapidly changing st.henri district! 
It really is something you'd expect in Brooklyn meaning doesn't look like much from the outside but once you open those doors you'll be more than surprised at how large the space is and the vibrance and atmosphere from within. So good actually I've been twice in the past 10 days!

Food is as you know of the mexican variety and filled with delicious menu items like johnny cakes, and tacos al pastor (a sort of braised pork?)...but don't overlook the lighter stuff like the super tasty tomato salad/corn bread... 

Only draw back I find is it might be on the pricier side but most of the dishes are for sharing so you'll just split the bill anyways...except if you take your date guys...don't be a cheapo..."}

Waitress was very friendly and attentive.  It was an amazing experience; highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Incredibly overrated and overpriced. Egos on wheels. Get over it, you're a food truck with mediocre undersized portions. Deluded hipsters."}
{"text":"Our experience was not so good.The server explained the special tacos of the night but never told us the price. The most expensive item on the menu is around 16 dollars so we never asked the sever for the price and got a salad another order of tacos and some potatoes. 
The salad was good and the tacos as well,but the sever forgot our order of potatoes and we ended up eating them after we finished our tacos. The worst happened when we revived the bill and realized that the tacos of the day were $25 !!! We were pretty disappointed and surprised as it is a big difference of price compared to the price ranges of their menu. Another not so good thing was that one of the beers we ordered was 8.50on the bill but on the menu is only eight dollars ( we don't mind paying 50 cents more but after what happened it added to our bad experience ). Overall we weren't impressed by the end of or service and left pretty disappointed. The sever should've told us the price of the special, specially when the price is almost twice as much as one of their most expensive items on their menu."}
{"text":"Grumman78 has acquired something of a cult status in Montreal: when this truck pops up, Montrealers flock. I tried a taco for the second time at Juste Pour Nourrire, a street foodie off-shoot of the Just For Laughs festival. Everyone was there for the tacos, it seemed; it was the only stand that had a line up. This taco truck, it's got buzz. And a line it was: we waited for a long time;  the food was doled out very slowly as the people in line texted and tweeted on their phones in anticipation. 

While we were waiting in line, a girl leaned out of the taco truck to erase \"suckling pig\" from the chalkboard menu. They seem to make one unusual taco variety at a time, at least this particular festival. Some people gave up and forfeited their place in line in favor of easier-to-acquire food.

But I persevered, and was rewarded with a taco of the new flavour:  chorizo, black beans, and ranch salad. Very tasty, a great combination of flavours and textures, satisfying and filling. But I'm not sure it was worth 25 minutes in line.

I would definitely try the tacos again, preferably in a non-festival, less crowded moment. They supposedly show up at Nouveau Palais (281 Bernard Ouest) every Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday from midnight - 3AM. I'd suggest catching them there next time you're out late drinking in the Mile End."}
{"text":"having heard so much about these folks, and being from california, where i eat tacos almost every day, i passed by the pop-up on bernard last night. 

we tried the lamb tacos and vegetarian tacos, each order of 2 tacos was like $7-8.  overall, not very impressed.  the lamb was tough, overcooked, and under-seasoned with a questionable flavor combination, even if they were going for a lebanese-style shwerma or turkish-style doner.  the vegetarian tacos reminded me of vancouver somehow or berkeley: staid, with a deep, longing glance at the 1970s.  overall, the quality of the ingredients seemed about what one would expect in montreal during the winter, though the (very large) tortilla itself was gritty and factory-made, it tasted like ours taste when they're 2-3 days old.  there was also a banh mi taco (which the server managed somehow to mispronounce! and which, by description, seemed to go the banh mi xiu mai route, which i don't mind at all), and an octopus taco at an eye-popping $12, the price ruling it out on principle.

now, these guys are shooting for the sf/la-style nouveau taco, and they seem to be doing it earnestly.  but aside from the fact that i just felt like i was eating the product of a mediocre cook, the tortillas bummed me out, the cost to quality struck me as a bit unfavorable, and overall, the whole thing just seems to be trading on the novelty rather than any great passion or skill.  that said, they're sure to improve."}
{"text":"This is for the food truck:

2 stars is not for the food quality - the food is yummy and I love their tacos. Each of the 2 or 3 bites per tiny taco is delicious.

But seriously - two weeks ago, and always before that, the Bhan Mi taco was $5. And then at some point DURING the food truck fair in the just for laughs fest, it was marked up to $6. Little eraser job on the chalk board menu and up a dollar. It is already pricey, but trying to milk it like that is just plain freakin tacky. Seriously. 

That makes me want to punch-in the face of their little cartoon taco. 

The people working there were quite slow. Others have commented on lack of smile and friendliness and all that - yes, that is true. But friendliness in the service industry is pretty rare in this city. 

Your tip jar will remain empty from me."}
{"text":"Not sure which one came out first, their food truck or their shop but either way both are amazing.  The menu is short but food isn't short on taste at all. Located in a converted garage, it's a unique place to hit up for lunch or dinner. Much like the food truck dishes, single portion dishes might not be very filling and it could add up really quickly on your tab. They have great tasting desserts loaded on a cart that's almost a must."}
{"text":"Those are some tasty Tacos.  
That's what I was thinking when I scarfed mine down.
Hoping one of my Friends would get Foie Gras($14.78) so I can nibble.

Let's just say my Friends are as cheap ass as I am if not more so.
That's partly the reason for the rating Grumman78 Taco Truck receives.
As memory serves, this be the first time I've paid more than $3.00 per Taco.
Burritos excluded, but of course.

Porc BBQ($5.22)

The freshness of the toppings(Radish, Onion, Cilantro)
The satisfying smooth earthiness of the Refried Bean.
The Pulled Pork flavour didn't seem to stand out as much.

Boeuf Ancho($5.22)

I liked Porc BBQ better."}
{"text":"My girlfriend is a foodie! I've always had an extreme love for food, but since this union, in my mind I've become a food critic as a good meal really depends on how the rest of our night will go lol. We're both moody ppl when hungry or when left disappointed. We had a 6hr drive ahead of us and decided to stop at this here after making one prior attempt which didn't happen because the place was PACKED and reservations were closed. So! Food was alright. I think I expected a little more seeing how busy this place is. My girlfriend and I had the fish tacos to start which were awesome. Her main was the k-town beef ribs which were so good! However could've been cooked just a little bit more as beef ribs are normally very fatty, so cooking at rare makes its it hard to eat. My main was the fried chicken and Johnny cakes which I wasn't a big fan of. I mean ... the fried chicken was good, the johnny cakes were like a corn bread pancake which I like, but I probably would've preferred my coleslaw on the side instead of on the top and the honey I didn't like very much! Service was good and our waiter/bartender SUPER knowledgeable on each item on the menu."}
{"text":"Although I really appreciate the mix of flavors in the food here, I wasn't too happy that there wasn't a bigger selection of mains. I totally appreciate places with compressed menus but as taco dishes, I could only eat the veg taco with beans  (which wasn't great) and the fried chicken with the pancake which was cute but the pancake really disintegrates and it wasn't really a taco. We also got the onion ring with shrimps starter which was interesting. The sweet potato side was okay.  

I think it would've been nice to have a selection of Mexican piquante sauces/salsa (on the table) to accompany the food but I'm just being picky. I didn't like the hot sauce on the table and Mexican food is more enjoyable with hot sauces. 

Overall, I felt there was too much hype surrounding this place. It is a bit pricey and the food isn't extraordinary. However, the decor, ambiance and service are very good and the private parking lot is a nice touch."}
{"text":"What an awesome little hideaway! Like stumbling on a treasure. In all of our pre-vacation research, we never heard about this place, but once we got to Montreal a few trusty bartenders told us about it, noting it was a not-to-miss.

We took the train there, and it was a bit of a walk from the station. Kinda felt like the middle of nowhere and wondered if we'd been misled, but then there it was. Packed and beautiful.

The most charming atmosphere, the most inventive and delicious menu.

Go experience it. Make a reservation."}
{"text":"I really love this place. I'm even giving it 5* despite the fact that there's no AC in the Summer and I find it a tad overpriced.

It's a nondescript building that looks like an abandoned garage from the outside but is so charming on the inside, with it's high ceilings, fairy lights and picnic tables. I've been here twice now. Once last year as part of a large group and yesterday sitting at the bar since we didn't reserve for dinner on a Saturday night.

Yesterday, one of the owners/chefs (I think) plucked out a fresh cherry tomato that they grow at their restaurant and gave it to me to try before I sat down to eat. Very cute. The staff is young, fun and cool. We were served by a charming and highly persuasive bartender. He got us to order an appetizer that ended up being one of my favourite bites of the night; the spicy dynamite (essentially chopped up salmon and fennel salad - delicious). As mains, we ordered the vegetarian zucchini & potato tacos (2) and the beef torta, along with a side of the garlic sweet potatoes. 

The beef in the torta is very lean and pilled high, and I liked the pickled onions it was served with. We didn't really like the veg tacos because blah potatoes in a corn tortilla isn't really my idea of delicious. Their in-house hot sauce is bomb. At $84 total, it's a little pricey but I would go again."}
{"text":"Je suis donc retournée quelques jours plus tard pour tester leur vraie carte en restaurant, et on peut dire que ça devient assez intéressant! On reste encore dans un menu court mais efficace, la carte de vin est belle et ils ont pas mal de drinks originaux. Mais surtout, le service à la clientèle était A1 ! Le gars au bar a pris le temps de m'expliquer chaque plat bien en détail, et ils nous a fait goûter à moi et mon ami plusieurs vins afin de trouver LA bouteille qui allait accompagner notre souper. 

Ma soirée a vraiment été marquée par le Spicy Dynamite, une salade de gros morceaux de saumon cru dans de la mayo épicée sur du fenouil et des oeufs de poissons. La tarte à la banane a bien terminé le repas aussi, toute simple mais rafraichissante. Et les tacos étaient excellents, comme d'habitude. Le décors rustique est vraiment chouette aussi, si vous avez aimé le truck vous aimerez aussi le QG!"}
{"text":"I booked a table for my wife's birthday. We were  9 total. The set up was great, the palette concept tables put together made it easy for everyone in the group to talk to each other. 

The food was very good. They offered us a approx. 40$ per person tasting menu, which was essentially multiples of the on menu items. The quantities were more than enough and we even had some food leftover. The food is inspired from their food truck style items. Tacos, fried chicken, salads, wings, turnip salad and salmon tartar. Really no complaints there and that is what we were expecting.

The space is very retro industrial. The industrial heating fan might of been the only unfortunate part but it added to it's charm! 

Also a plus, parking!"}
{"text":"I've had several of their tacos. All were very tasty. I would say that they are a little pricey for just a taco. But beggars can't be choosers, and in this province, street food vending had be illegal for decades. So bravo to Grumman 78 for finding a way around it."}
{"text":"So, this spot (restaurant) is über hipster clique - an obvious stomping ground for young trendies, but I was there for the tacos. The tacos are BOSS.

The décor is really great - awesome art, a few retro knick knacks here and there, and a ceiling netting hung with the most chilli peppers you've ever seen in one pile, unless you've been to India. Tables are handmade from old wooden pallets, and really well done. 

I brought my son here for a dinner out and we LOVED the beef and pork tacos we got. Service was fairly good, and the general ambiance pretty high. Not too long of a wait for food, either. 

I met the owner, and he's extremely proud of his business, which is a standout gem in the most downtrodden part of Saint-Henri, right next to the old Elpro building and practically on the railroad tracks. 

Going there for tacos is a real treat, but you will pay! A little on the pricey side, but like I said, the tacos here can't be beat."}
{"text":"I had been waiting to try this place for a while now. Finally got to go and I must say that I wasn't super impressed with the food but the decor and ambiance is super cool.

I also had the best popcorn I've ever had.

I'd go back and give it another go and try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I've long heard of Grumman so when I saw their food truck I was initially excited. Thus, my experience below is limited only to their food truck.

I don't recall EVER paying more than $3 for a taco but I did so by paying $7 for their Bahn-Mi taco. I expected a huge orgasmic tasting taco for that price but what I was served was smallish sized taco that I'd be more than happy to pay $3 or so for. The toppings were fresh and tasty and overall I liked it but I've had better... I truly felt the price was far too exaggerated, even by food truck standards. I can probably eat 4-5 of these but no way I'd pay this kind of price-tag. I had to fill myself up with left over fries from the very generous servings my friends got from the other food truck.

Furthermore, I also took their juice, I forgot the name but tasted somewhat like cranberry. It was served in a bag (with a straw) which made trying to eat your taco while holding a round plastic bag somewhat challenging. It was quite tasty however. I'd suggest investing in another container or a plastic bag that has a square bottom.

I feel like giving this place a 2 star rating somewhat unfair (the food truck once again) but at this point, they're just exaggerating their prices and they need to be called out for. The food is good but the value is clearly not. There's just no sense paying $7 for a taco. Hipster or not."}
{"text":"I went there on a special occasion, my brother's birthday.
It it's in an old garage with a touch of tropical island deco. The hostess wasn't smiling when she received us; she seemed so haughty. When she saw us holding the birthday cake, she notified us that she would charge each one of us an extra fee for each piece of cake. 
On the other hand the waiter was very nice.
We ordered a meat tacos that was chewy, and the porc tacos was missing sauces.
All in all I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"LOVE their banh mi tacos!   Amazing flavour profile.  I find it depends who constructs the tacos though, as the meat to veg ratio varies.  I def like a lot of the marinated veg! 
I ask for extra lime every time, as well. 
(I even have a lot of dietary restrictions and this is one thing I can order and eat as-is.)

Just wish the price-point wasn't so high!  As someone on a very low income, it's a one or twice a year treat."}
{"text":"I've had their tacos at Puce Pop back in March and although have only tried their vegetarian one, it's super flavour-filled and delicious! 

If you're going for \"authentic\" tacos, these are definitely fusion but I don't think you could/should be unimpressed! I got news the other day that they will be some from their HQ on Sunday (the 19th) at 2pm in St-Henri and if you haven't had one, it's definitely worth trying out! Oh and I think it's cash only!"}
{"text":"This is a review of the resto, not the truck.
 I went there on a Saturday night following a Gazette review, so the place was packed to the nuts. We didn't have a reservation so the hostess said she would text us when a spot opened up. One did in less than an hour, so we had time for a couple of drinks beforehand. I ordered the steak taco plate, which had a 9 ounce steak cooked medium rare and a potato purée that was delicious. The meal came a little fast as we had just got our drinks maybe 3 minutes prior, but we were hungry after the wait so it didn't matter. To some people that would be reason to bitch. The staff was efficient and polite and our server gave good advice and was knowledgeable about the menu. 
The décor was interesting without being too hip, which can get on my nerves, and I didn't see any of the hipster sheep with their side parted hair and their stupid ass beards, so all was good. It was a fun night."}
{"text":"Excellent sur toute la ligne, bouffe, ambiance, déco!"}
{"text":"Delicious and creative taco's, although in Montreal we have a lack of taco trucks so everyone may have flipped out on this one and lost all perspective. Friends of mine recently booked the taco truck to cater their wedding and have been thrilled with the kind service and tasty sampling options, so the great reputation comes with a dose of good-people-ness that puts me up to 5 stars."}
{"text":"Le taco au pulled pork, un mot YUM!!!!! Avec les garnitures de type banh mi, re-yum. Mais une étoile de moins pour la portion/prix.... I'm a big eater."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is a Pinterest DIY dream - very fun! But don't wear delicate leggings or clothes because they might get caught/pulled on the crate tables.

1. They have their own private parking lot with free parking so that's awesome!

2. The washroom is very clean and nice A+ .. I also liked that you could see into the kitchen cooking area and it was military style cleanliness.

3. Food is super creative and fun - I really enjoyed the presentation and how fresh everything was.. Also the food came out sooooo quickly, almost at a food truck pace.... However, it isn't the tastiest food and not authentic feeling so if you're looking for amazing food only this might disappoint. 

4. They have an awesome desert cart (I have included a photo below) veryyy cute! 

5. The servers are friendly and clearly enjoy working there, ours was super nice, but I think it was her birthday or something and she kind of forgot about us so we had to wait a shockingly long time for our bills after asking again to another server.. And when the bills came they were REALLY mixed up haha one person had a $20 bill instead of $55 and one person had an $85 instead of $50 (but we were a decent sized group and the second server probably had no idea how the orders were made so she finally had to get our server to come and sort it out and after a few more tries, they finally got it right and they were super nice about it and apologized. 

I think overall the ambiance and environment was super chill and fun. It was packed but super spacious, and no one was pressuring us to hurry up to leave - well clearly they had kind of forgotten that we were even still there at the end :'D.  

I will definitely go back for a night out with friends but only to order socially, not for dinner. Because the food is slightly overpriced for the food itself but realistically you're paying for a really fun and enjoyable experience and I think it's definitely worth it and a unique place worth trying - you'll probably wanna go back too!"}
{"text":"This was an amazing experience.

It was a bit hard to find and I do admit we got lost on the way but when we entered the restaurant, all our worries went away. I would highly recommend getting whatever specials they have, for us on the night it was a green apple and bakchoy salad with blue cheese and the sweet potato sides. Definitely get things to share so you can try a lot of their menu!

In terms of the actual mains, the fried chicken taco was fantastic. Within the first bite, I was so happy with our choice of restaurant for the night. The vegetarian tacos weren't bad. The taco with pork belly was average. All in all, a fantastic meal and a wonderful experience. I would definitely come back to eat again but maybe in two or three weeks because I overstuffed myself."}
{"text":"Well I have to say that I probably still have the taste of the lamb taco in my mouth after 2 months of eating them....yes them!! We ordered 2 round of lamb, it was too good! 
Can't believe that someone could say that it was under seasoned when mine were so perfectly seasoned and cooked!
Loved the veggie one but the lamb was my \"coup de coeur\"!
I think that this is a bright idea and I am glad to find tacos in Mtl with flavors!!
Can't wait to go for more!
PS My friend who was with me that nite keeps reminding that we need to go back when I am back in town! Apparently, I was not the only one who loved them!"}
{"text":"Un resto-concept vraiment chouette, très industriel (c'est un ancien garage), avec cuisine ouverte, service chaleureux et nourriture délicieuse.
Super en groupe, quand j'y vais on commande plein de plats à partager, et on commande tant qu'on a faim, pas de rush pour dégager rapidement. Les desserts sont aussi excellents.
Excellente ambiance, excellente nourriture, parfait pour les groupes, service décontracté mais très efficace.
Réservation à peu près obligatoire."}
{"text":"Just came back from my 3rd Grumman'78 visit at their St. Henri location. Sure their food truck is good and their short-lived Faubourg restaurant was satisfying... but I was only 'in-like' with them. I'm IN LOVE with their restaurent on De Courcelle. How in love? My GF and I are getting married there this year! Today's Grumman adventure included a raw salmon salade appetizer, steak and bahn mi (pulled pork) taco mains, and Papas Grumman as a side. (It's impossible to describe how amazing the Papas Grumman is... sweet potatoes... garlic... cheese...) We also shared a tasty bottle of wine (recommended by our lovely waitress) and a chocolate panna cotta for dessert. What a feel good place and enjoyable Saturday evening."}
{"text":"Tres bons tortillas, bonne ambiance! Vous voudrez y retourner:)"}
{"text":"Food was over priced and bland. Michelada was tiny and disgusting. Beer was flat. Service was quick but gauche and tactless. Best thing about the place was the constant refilling of water."}
{"text":"The night started out rainy and slightly depressing. It was our anniversary, which I completely forgot about, it was pouring outside and neither I or the bf had the slightest motivation to whip up a half-decent meal. We decided to head over to Grumman '78, after all it was next to our house, we had been curious about it ever since we moved, and it was low-key enough. 

I'm sure glad the bf came up with the idea because my experience at Grumman '78 turned the evening around. I was delighted by the decor the minute I stepped in. The twinkling lights, the rough wood tables, and the leather high chairs were the perfect mix of classy and casual. The staff was so nice and charming; it felt like everyone was having a good time where ever we looked around. We ordered cocktails, starters, tacos, fried chicken, and a side to share. 

The cocktails were nice and not heavy on the sugar. I thought they were well balanced while the bf would have preferred them a little more juicy. I suggest you take a look at their cocktail menu; their offering is original.

The starters were good but the tacos were amazing! I would definitely go back and just get tacos. Forget the fried chicken, just tacos and papas (side dish). Nothing bad to be said about fried chicken, it was good but it's never been my thing...a little comprise here for the bf. The side dish which consisted of sweet potatoes with herbs and cheese was delicious. The bf devoured his plate even though he's not a fan of yams.  It's definitely on the heavy and greasy side so sharing is the way to go. If you've already ordered a ton of food, switching the side plate by a salad from the starters might be a good idea. I can't say much about the desserts since I already full. 

The bill...it wasn't cheap but it wasn't terrible either. It was $95 tip and tax in for 2. Considering we had about $25 of alcohol I'd say the pricing was fair for the good quality, flavour pairings, and the service. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Really loveeee this place, especially for a birthday. 

Great ambiance.
Good food.
Nice staff.
Fun place.

Can't go wrong. A nice selection of tacos and good cocktails. Good wine lust as well.

Open on sundays which is rare for good food in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Amaze balls! Tender octopus?! How! Everything was delicious and the service was top notch. 

And head to leche desserts for the finale!"}
{"text":"Why is this not a 5 star review? One word: the staff...okay well that's two, but you get the point. They didn't ruin my experience; the food (more to come) was finger licking good, but I felt that staff that we interacted with could have been more friendly and attentive. Firstly, our waiter took two out of three people's drink order...I may be petite, but I'm not invisible, right? When two of us got our drinks, there was no apology for missing an order, he just took another order like no error.

With that said, the food was spectacular! Quick run down of our meal...We started with the tartare de cheval chipotle and papas Grumman. You read correctly folks, that is horse meat on the menu. Being the adventurous eaters that we are, we had to try this dish. No matter what the politics around this is, we were in Quebec and it's more a norm than anywhere else in Canada. To be honest though, it had to really concentrate to taste a difference between horse and beef. There was a lot of chipotle sauce mixed in with crispy tortilla chips. It was definitely tasty, not matter what meat it was. The papas were delicious friend sweet potato cubes with crumbly cheese. It's cheese and starch, who wouldn't like that? Tacos al pastor were up next. The pork was sweet and spicy with bits of pineapple that is typical of this taco. We gobbled it up and even fought over the last one. (We ended up sharing it.)

Overall, I would go back...but maybe were a big flashy hat so that I'm noticed this time."}
{"text":"Super cool restaurant with a hip / trendy vibe. The food is great but somewhat expensive. Great date spot or for groups. Worth checking out, but a bit hard to get to without a car."}
{"text":"My Grumman experience has been slowly sliding down as much as I visit them, but I still like the concept enough and as long as they feed me with Banh Mi tacos I would never complain. 

My first Grumman encounter was during the food truck Fridays at the Olympic Stadium. The entire event is so messy and overwhelming that I hardly remember what were the tacos we ordered after waiting on a loong line. They were so delicious to make me think I must visit the restaurant. 

The Grumman garage is a sweet place to be, in the coldest winter months I can still imagine I'm sitting outside picnicking with tacos. Sitting at the bar if you are only with your sweet one is preferable as you get faster what you want. If you are in a bigger group I would definitely recommend a table near the opened kitchen at the back of the room, feels kind of warm and more comfy. 

Our last dinner was a slight disappointment. Beer list is short anyway, but the IPA was not available, leading to a wave of moaning on our table. Bloody Caesar was just fine, I would say pretty standard. Food wise Grumman rarely lets you down, but I found the tacos bland and even ordinary that night, we shared the beef tacos and tacos del pastor, because guess what, they were out of Banh Mi tacos...!!!! For compensation the Spicy Dynamite appetizer, raw salmon and fennel salad, was outstanding. To round out your satisfaction and tummy never forget to order the sweet potatoes: papas'78!

Special request: Dear Grumman, please, please, keep the Banh Mi tacos permanently on the menu!"}
{"text":"Food was decent and the staff were nice. Extremely poor value. 2 tacos for $15? You don't even pay that much in midtown Manhattan.

Major pass."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Grumman - from the decor to the friendly staff to the food. We had a few different items on the menu but two of the standouts were the lamb tacos seasoned to perfect with the lamb melting in your mouth and the tres leches pie. The pricing was very reasonable , especially considering the great quality of the food and the service . I would definitely recommend this place and I am looking forward to going back !"}
{"text":"J'ai eu l'occasion de goûter à la cuisine de Grumman78 au dernier Osheaga de Montréal.

Honnêtement, le hype était tellement fort autour du truck/resto que mes attentes étaient assez élevées.

Je fut déçu.

J'avais beau savoir que les ingrédients étaient originaux, le type de cuisine intéressant, rien n'a réussis à m'épater. Ma commande m'es arrivée extrêmement froide (aucun excuses d'attente vu que nous étions les seuls en ligne a commander) et le service fut assez moyen. 

Dommage, je suis pour les ''food trucks'' mais celui-ci m'a laissé sur ma faim. 

Peut-être que j'ai pas eu de chance."}
{"text":"Ok food, decent service and cool space. Overpriced for what it is.  Drinks were poor."}
{"text":"Oh how the mighty has fallen...

I've been in love with Grumman78 for years, but admittedly, I hadn't been in a while. I went last night on a whim and I'm sad to report that it isn't as amazing as it once was.

I will proceed chronologically for simplicity:

- booking online via YP dine was a breeze. Love it!

- there were a few families, that was comforting seeing how our group included a kid, the garage door was open, the temperature nice, and the ambiance pleasant. So far so good.

- then we get the menu. The horse tartare is gone! What? My heart broke. Nevertheless, it seems to have been replaced by a spicy salmon dish, and there were a few interesting taco options. We order.

- my 12$ cocktail arrives, and it's tiny. It look like a shot in a cocktail glass. It's tasty, but 12$ for 2 sips?

- the appetizers arrive. The shrimp toastada is nice, but the spicy salmon dish doesn't live up to the former horse tartare. What a disappointment.

- they offer a cheese quesadilla for kids, which was perfect and appreciated by the young one in our group.

- then... we waited. For almost an hour. 

People who had arrived after us and had ordered the exact same main courses were receiving their orders around us. After about 45 minutes, the waiter came and said \"you guys want desserts?\" 

I replied \"it'd be nice to get the main course before we think about dessert.\"

- we finally got the main courses after a few more minutes. The \"taco of the month\" was bland and disappointing. The \"beef torta\" was good, but not life changing like my first few Grumman experiences. 

The Papas were all right, but I'm not a fan of sweet potatoes and would've found them much better had they been prepared with regular potatoes.

We didn't have dessert.

In conclusion; 

Service was a chaotic and disorganized. 

30 minutes after we arrived, I got a call and text from the restaurant asking if we were going to show up. We had clearly identified ourselves by name.

But more importantly, the food didn't live up to its once glorious days.

I'll go again to see if this was just an odd night; but I'm afraid. I'm afraid that we lost a glorious restaurant with delicious food."}
{"text":"Nous avons commandé le saumon cru, les tacos de chorizo, les patates douces à l'ail et le mac&cheese dans un piment frits et tout était absolument délicieux. Le service était excellent, le serveur était efficace et attentif. Les drinks sont petits, dispendieux et pas particulièrement bons mais pour le reste, les prix sont très raisonnables."}
{"text":"How come the reviews of Grumman78 are so divided?! It seems that people either love it or hate it. Unfortunately, I am in the latter category.  The fried chicken was dry and crumbly and tasted horrible. Nothing about it worked. The tacos we ordered were ok. They were not remarkable (I make better at home). The food was just no. The prices too expensive for what it is. The service was slow and cold - I felt like we were bothering the waiter by asking if we could place a drink order. We waited and waited and waited some more for a waiter to come take our food order. We ended up leaving after appetizers and the first round of drinks because we were hungry and thirsty. The service is a fail - I don't care how slouchy the waiter's smurf hat is or how many tattoos he has or what band is on his shirt. FAIL. We went down the road to another restaurant that was more than happy to take our money."}
{"text":"Délicieux tacos ! Situé dans le Faubourg Sainte-Catherine, les tacos de chez Grumman 78, sont frais fait sur place et délicieux ! Leur jus dans les poches aussi et sont exotiques ! Le seul problème c'est qu'on mange dans un ''food court'', mais on y va juste pour la bouffe après tout et non pour l'emplacement. Essayez les, chacun coûtent environ entre 4/5$, ça va vous changer des tacos des autres restaurants commerciaux !"}
{"text":"I was on Mont-Royal earlier this week and was excited to see their truck perched near the chalet on top of the mountain, because I had heard good things about them. Sadly, while the beef taco was wonderfully tasty, I was disappointed with the smile deprived service (the dude seemed offended when I asked how big the serving was before ordering). I found that their offer didn't give reasonable value for money. For around $7, you get a single taco, so to make it into a meal, you need to get two, which will set you back $14. I think that's steep considering that you're eating out of a paper plate with a plastic fork. Oh and that dude shouldn't work in hospitality!"}
{"text":"FOOD TRUCK!!! Tacos!! 

I am glad that Grumman78 takes credit cards!! I can't imagine street food establishments would take cards, but at this price point... $6 for a taco.. and don't even think about the Foie Gras taco close to $17.. I really need to whip out my credit card!

The tacos are smallish.. I smell it and admire it and  tried to savour every bite... love the garnish especially the cilantro with the splash of fresh lime.

Pork BBQ and Boeuf Ancho are both tasty... I can eat 6 of those... 

Credit card time again??"}
{"text":"Swill Merchants

   Words that come to mind when thinking of my dining experience:

Dilapidated
Hipster
Cheap (not in the good way)
Half assed
Skimpy
Lack of effort
Pompous

   I could go on. Suffice to say, i have no positive commentary. The food was overpriced and undersized and the place was a dump. I guess being adjacent to the 'fattal lofts' has inspired the 'who gives a shit' decor theme.

Come on, fuck.

Waka Waka"}
{"text":"J'adore le camion comme tel, mais mon expérience au restaurant a été pas mal différente. En arrivant, on nous a assis à une table faite de matériaux recyclés qui va bien avec le thème \"industriel\" de la place mais qui me rendait presque mal à l'aise tellement j'étais assise loin de mes amies à cause de dimensions bizarres. Pour le menu, c'est beaucoup plus varié que celui du camion car ils ont une grande cuisine! On a essayé le tartare en entrée que j'ai bien aimé. Pour le repas on s'est partagé deux assiettes de tacos. Tout était quand même bon mais rien ne m'a vraiment impressionné côté saveurs. On dirait que ça manquait un peu de \"oumpff\" et au lieu le goût de tortilla était plus présent que celui des ingrédients à l'intérieur. Ayant mangé à partir du camion plus souvent, je retournerai si je les croise dans une festival, mais pour le resto, il y en a d'autres que je préfère (et d'autres à essayer) quand j'ai vraiment envie de vrais tacos."}
{"text":"Wow!  Tex Mex hitting Montreal, heaven!  

My friend took me here for dinner - it was both our first time coming here, and really neat to see St. Henri getting some cool restaurants.  The outside suggests that you are going to be eating in a garage, and truth be told, you are.  The decor inside is shabby chic, with some tables made of wooden pallets (be careful if you are wearing tights).  Great music on the stereo.  

Food seems pricey from the outset, but well worth it, as the portions are quite large.  I ordered the octopus/chorizo tacos which were tasty and very filling, and also the tomato salad, which was also a good start (but both those things were too much for one person.)  Salmon tartare was super fresh and we devoured that quickly.  There was also a \"Buffalo Bits\" salad - which we thought would be a salad with some cleverly placed pieces of buffalo wings, blue cheese, maybe some celery or carrot sticks but was actually a little bit of cole slaw and a MASSIVE PILE of chicken wings.  Whoops.  When I say MASSIVE PILE, I mean beyond Cheesecake Factory massive.  

So overall, I really liked this place - but probably could've used a steer on portion sizes!  At the very least, I did have some yummy leftovers for lunch the next morning....!"}
{"text":"One of those weird instances of style over substance that actually works, is plenty fun, and comes completely recommended. I've never walked out of there less than excited to go back.

I've you've enjoyed tacos outside of Montreal before, don't be alarmed at paying way too much for not-quite-the-best tacos you've ever had. I've you've had fried chicken anywhere else in Montreal (Icechouse, Triple Crown), then really skip overpaying for the fried chicken here. Expect however to just have a great time eating whatever you do end up slightly over paying for. 

There's really no other place like Grumman's you can experience in the city. Sure it's a hipster mouse-trap, but it's a friendly hipster mouse-trap with personality and heart. The staff is never less than stellar and pleasant and fun and ready to laugh with you over just about anything, and from the moment you walk in the vibe is that of people having a good time being serviced by people who appear to be enjoying themselves working there. 

I've nitpicked the pricing a bit and that's the market in Quebec unfortunately, but the food is inventive and really good (not best) enough that you never get the impression you're actually overpaying for anything. I recommend the extensive wine list, and suggest caution with the cocktails; the recipes are way outside your standard playbook, and I've yet to have one that didn't have me reaching to find why someone thought that would make a good drink. The wine though..."}
{"text":"As the \"foodie\" of my high school reunion group, I was tasked with finding a fun place with good food to host a large group on a Friday... not the easiest challenge but one I figured I could handled. Based on what was required, I figured now was a good opportunity to try out the restaurant of one of my favourite food trucks here in Montreal, Grumman 78.

Located in what appears to be an old converted garage and in what used to be (and still is) their prep kitchen for the truck itself, Grumman 78 has a nice relaxed vibe eminating from its locale. Funky artwork, old arcade machines, white brick walls, large wooden tables, old Christmas lights and good music - this is definitely not a formal restaurant. Given the open nature of the space and the fact it was Friday, a little noisy for conversation but it's the kind of room that I could see being enjoyment on a different night and time.

As we were a large group, we were beholden to a fixed menu but one that had been proposed to me in advance and which I had the option of making changes to. Given that it was a combination of many of their staple dishes, I had no issues with what they offered us. At this moment, I want to take a second to discuss the service of the evening. Our meal got off to a bit of rocky start due to no-shows on our end which delayed the start of the meal by a good hour and caused some issues as our number dropped from what we had confirmed for the fixed menu. While it got sorted out, it was a little surprising to see how we weren't offered drinks more quickly as we waited for those who ended up not coming or that we weren't checked on again until we eventually decided to assume those no-shows were actually not coming. That followed a bit of a pattern throughout the night of decidedly slow service despite our waiter being very friendly. An entire order of drinks never came and the wait times between the different dishes was surprisingly long. Now, I noticed that there were at least 2 other large (i.e 10+) groups in the restaurant at the same time which may explain some of the issues but regardless it was a disappointment.

The first appetizer was a Mackerel crudo. A combination of brined Mackerel, citrus fruits, pomegranate and avocado, this was a very light and fresh starter. Great combination between the salty Mackerel, the sweet acidic fruits and the creamy avocado. Tons of flavours without being overbearing.

The other appetizer was a beet salad with apples, creme fraiche, croutons and herbs. Another interesting combination of items and flavours. The redness of the beets created quite a visually striking dish. The richness of the creme fraiche and acidity of the apples helped to freshen up the beets which are not a favourite of mine under normal circumstances.

The next course was what made Grumman 78 in the first place: their soft shell tacos. In this instance, we were treated to two types: Bahn-Mi and Pimenton-Feta. The Bahn-Mi ones were comprised of pulled pork, hoisin sauce, pickled daikon and carrots. The Pimenton-Feta ones were Pimenton braised red beans, radish salad and feta. As we were a large group, there were served family style to allow you to build your own - although we had an issue in terms of quantity of tortillas. We eventually got extras but they were a little slow to come. Regardless, the tacos themselves were delicious - both were flavourful and texture rich. I had already had the Bahn-Mi before- it was the original taco I tried of theirs from their food truck. Nice combination of sweet and fatty. The Pimenton-Feta was a new one for me - not a huge fan of the beans themselves but the mix with the feta and the radish made it work rather nicely.

The next service was the final main: Fried Chicken and Johnny Cakes (cornmeal pancakes) with coleslaw and Ranch dressing. I loved these - the fried chicken was crispy but still moist inside, the coleslaw was light and fresh, the ranch dressing added some creaminess and the pancakes were a perfect vehicle for the whole thing. I just wished that there had been more!

For dessert, we got individual key lime pies. Now, I am a huge key lime pie fan so imitators need not present themselves to me at a restaurant. This one was quite good - a crunchy graham crust at the bottom and nice key lime filling. A solid end to the meal.

All in all, my time at Grumman 78 left me conflicted - the food was awesome as I had expected given my experiences with the food truck however the service issues on this evening left a slightly sour note for my dinner mates and I. I am generally more forgiving on these things but I suspect some of my friends won't be based on our discussions at the bar afterwards. The food here is too good not to check out but perhaps I would recommend not bringing a large group firstly - a table of 2 or 4 should not run into the issues we did. At least visit the food truck when it comes out this summer. I certainly plan to.

{"text":"Came here on a super busy friday night, luckily they had a table for 2 available. We ordered some drinks, a dos equis beer and a margarita which was absolutely delish! We got an order of patates78, sweet potatoes with some sort of mayo and garlic sauce which were great, but we also got steak tacos that were so soggy and tastless we couldn't finish them. We also tried to order their fried chicken dish, but was told they ran out and are serving fried turkey instead. I like turkey just fine, but really wanted that chicken. The turkey was spicy and tender, but parts of it were cold and it was damn near impossible to cut. I think this place is overrated to be honest."}
{"text":"I'm sure you've come across the green taco truck at the various summer festivals in our wonderful city. Now that the summer is sadly winding down, you may want to follow them on Twitter to see where they're at!

Grumman78 changes menu everyday: different tacos are offered everyday. All those that I tried had a good combination of flavor. However, I thought that they were always too salty. I definitely suggest to pay extra to add crabmeat to your taco. Pulled pork plus crab... mmmm! 

Despite all the great food that can be found in Montreal, street food is pretty much non existant. Outdated lawmakers are to blame for that. Through some loophole, Grumman78 is one of the only food truck allowed to operate. Maybe it's because of the novelty factor but they are quite popular despite being quite pricey (2 tacos for 9$ ain't cheap son!). 

Nonetheless, I am seriously hoping that Grumman78 continues on its success and will encourage young talented chefs to bring more delicious food to our streets!"}
{"text":"I think this place is overrated. My favourite taco place in town is probably Restaurant Mais (though I haven't been there in a while - hopefully it's still solid). Going back to Grumman: I think it's over-priced and their tacos are only average (when I compare to upscale taco joints in other major cities - e.g., Big Star in Chicago). Even their other items were meh (e.g., fried chicken, salad, okra-related item). I did not try their deserts though - which a dinner-mate raved about (he even pre-ordered a piece of pie to bring back home to his wife). The cocktails were good. I'm not itching to return here - but I also am far from being \"anti\" the restaurant as well. I'll go but I won't push for it."}
{"text":"Endroit très cool et dynamique, des tacos inventifs et très bien apprêtés, goûteux, originaux... belle trouvaille pour moi.

Beaux vins au verre et au prix plus que raisonnables,

Super endroit pour faire une fête en groupe.

J'y retourne!"}
{"text":"It is my first time at Grumman. I like the concept of a parking/garage turned into a restaurant. The design is nice and creative made out of wood.
It is a casual place. You can go there with friends to have a drink and tacos. I am not a fan of tacos, but I can say that I had better.

The place was packed for a Saturday night.
You do not have much options for beer. The choices are very limited.
I was also able to try the margarita, not the best I had.
They should place more effort on the drinks (more variety and better quality).

I shared a salmon dynamite as starter. It is good and do recommend it.
But when it comes to the tacos, I wasn't impressed at all. I shared the Carnitas tacos and the Steak tacos. The carnitas is a disappointment. I wasn't sure what I was eating. On the other hand, the steak was fine.
Another comment on the portions. We are not in a french gourmet restaurant. We are in a tacos place and for the price you're paying, the portions need to be more \"Tacowi\".

When it comes to the service, the waiters/waitress are not that helpful.
When I go to a restaurant, I expect the waiters to know their menu in order to advise properly their customers. When I ask questions/advise about the food, I expect to get some in return. It wasn't the case here, not even for the simplest questions like what it is your best seller."}
{"text":"Grumman78's hype started back when they appeared in this very noticeable green truck during Montreal's most seeked festivals such as Jazz Festival, Just for Laughs or Francofolies just to name a few.  Serving not your regular taco, Grumman78 stirred the interest of local foodies towards food trucks again, a practice that is banned in Montreal.  

I tried it once at an event in the old port, did remember its originality but was not mesmerized by the taste that much.  This weekend, I had the opportunity to have a tasting menu at a birthday of a friend.  We were served a variety of 3 tacos, 2 appetizers and one dessert.  Their kitchen is located in a parking lot in St-Henri and is seriously so well hidden. I would have never thought little tacos were being made in that place!

The drinks they offered were quite interesting.  I had the horchata which is a beverage made of rice, cinnamon and other spices as well as rum. It was served in a bag with a straw which added a fun factor!

We were very excited about our first two courses: fried chicken and potato salad & avocado mousse and mackerel ceviche served with fried won-ton wrappers!!! the taste was spot on and the play on textures elevated our level of excitement!

However, as we started on the tacos munching, we noticed a similar taste profile in all of them even though the toppings were very different.  We had a chorizo taco, a 'thanksgiving' taco (turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing...) and fish&chip style taco.  All of them were extremely original and the concept was definitely there.  But the addition of the refried beans and coriander in all of them undermine the uniqueness and individuality of each of them.  I am no expert taco eater and that is only my personal opinion.  I also found that their choice of tortilla overwhelms the delicate taste of some ingredients.  Maybe the fact that we ate that much didn't help either. If we were only to have one taco, i am pretty sure I will have been very satisfied.

Although the food was not my highlight of the evening, i must say that the service was perfect! They expertly and sleekly removed our dishes as we were finishing and we are always there whenever we had a question. They are also very well equipped in the kitchen! They have a 'sous-vide' machine, a pacojet (can pulverize any food or make the smoothest sherbet or ice cream ever) and much more...

For your real taco lovers, it may be an amazing idea to have them host a private party! And i think taco lovers or not, you must at least try them at least once.  They will be opening a counter in Faubourg Ste-Catherine in the upcoming month! Thus, you wont have to track down every event to have a try at their taco!"}

{"text":"This was excellent! One of the best meals I've ever had, really. A friend and I were in town for the Grand Prix and we had late dinner reservations downtown but we needed to grab some food to hold us over. We just looked up some places close to our Airbnb and found this place right down the street.

We got there right at 6 when they opened, which is probably the only reason we were able to get a table without reservations. The atmosphere is just awesome there. Clearly just an old garage that they transformed into a restaurant but they did a really great job. It was a really nice evening so having the big open door and windows was really nice and comfortable.

We started out with some margaritas which really hit the spot so we had a couple more. They had a scallop appetizer which we ordered and also got the ceviche which was so effing good we ordered a second order of it. I could have eaten a half dozen orders, was that good. For an entree we split an order of 4 Bahn Mi tacos, which I've never had before but were also really, really good.

The service was just as good as the food and atmosphere. The waitress took time out to write down a whole list of other restaurants that we should check out while we were in town and was overall very accommodating.

I guess it was a combination of being really hungry, being a Mexican food fiend, it was a beautiful day, had great drinks, great food, service, and atmosphere but it was one of the most enjoyable meals I've ever had. 5 stars, wish I could give it 6."}
