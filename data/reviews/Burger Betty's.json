{"text":"Normally, I think I'd give Jaded (formerly Burger Betty's) a three.  But considering that it's two previous incarnations were struggling to be average, I'll make an exception and laude the effort to really improve the quality of the menu.  An assortment of appetizers, salads, burgers, hot sandwiches, and acutal entrees (like you can order a steak!).    I had the philly steak sandwhich, which was really good.  My friend had the cranberry-pesto pasta and enjoyed it as well.  While the effort to go upscale with what is clearly a casual dining kind of place has not really evolved yet in the decor (though anything is better than faux-Aussie), they are really doing good things with the food.  I'm actually motivated to make a return trip and not just by lack of other options."}
{"text":"Funny story.   One hot summer day less than a year ago my dad and I were out in search of a late lunch/ early dinner. A burger sounded fine and we had driven past this place a few times so we thought we'd drop in.   We knew that quite a few places on this stretch were of the gay persuasion, but it didn't occur to us that Burger Betty's would be one.   Walk inside and you'll quickly realize that this is not intended for a father-son lunch spot. We backpedaled. We asked a couple of questions. We left.   Truth be told, my dad and I are both liberal guys and would have stuck around if the burgers weren't so expensive. From the looks of the other reviews we made the right call."}
{"text":"This new incarnation of Hamburger Mary's is less than impressive. Of course it wasn't very impressive while it was still Hamburger Mary's.   The service is hit and miss and the food is sub-par. Every time I've been here and ordered a burger, the bun has been stale and crumbly. Every. Time. The salads consisted mostly of the delectable white core of the iceberg lettuce that has no flavor.  The Sunday breakfast buffet is fairly expensive, around $15 per person. The only redeeming feature of the buffet is the 1 cent mimosas. Smoking is still allowed inside the restaurant (until May at least).  If you're going to a place to hang out with a large group of friends who drink and smoke and food isn't a pressing issue, then this may be the place for you.   I'm sorry, Burger Betty's. I've tried to like you from way back when, but it's time for me to move on. I have to see other restaurants. I hope you understand. It's not you, it's me."}
{"text":"Eh.  Went to BB yesterday around 5ish for a Pucker promotion...It was the first stop in about 5 bars for our Pucker gay pride bar crawl and it was my first time there.  I wasn't really impressed.  The staff was very friendly and helpful, including the owner, but the server I had was pretty sloooow and a little out of it. We asked for bottle Miller Lite's, we got draft.     And she took away the ashtray while my friend was smoking.  She left him sitting there with the ash about to fall everywhere while she took 5 minutes to get him a new one.  Maybe this is the server in me, but when you take an ashtray away to clean it, you put a new, clean one down first.   I thought the bathroom was cool, but perhaps a bit dingy. The ceiling had glow in the dark paint on it, and I really enjoyed that for some reason.   A lady asked me to put a Pucker sticker on her boob. I did.   We decided to give the burgers a whirl, but my pal and I both subsituted the meat for a garden patty.  I think it's awesome that they actually give customers that option in the first place- not thaaat many restaurants remember the vegetarians of the world- but Burger Betty's does and that's great.  I got the original betty with cheese and my friend got the garlic burger.  The food took forever and a day to come out and although there were about 50 people in the joint, I only saw one other table with food. What was the hold up?  It took about 45-50 minutes. For a garden burger and some fries? What the heck?   And it cost a $1 extra to exchange your meat patty for a garden burger. I thought that was a little silly.  All in all, I'd have to say that the burger was just okay.  But the fries were really good- oh and the beer was only $1.75 for a huge draft Miller Lite.  3 stars for Betty."}
{"text":"Listen Betty - Ya just can't charge these prices for this quality.  Pick one.  Either drop your prices to make it just a large bar food type menu - or dramatically increase the quality. Notice I didn't say quantity.  The burgers are big.  And a hungry person might not finish them.  But they wouldn't particularly like it.  And if you want them to order one again, they need to like it.    Sure, you've got a bit of a corner on the whole gay restaurant thing.  (Not a total corner on it though - but I'll give that there isn't that much competition.)  But do you really want to ride on those laurels?  I think you can do better.  I hope you do better soon.  How about a 1/2 size burger for 1/2 the price?  Same thing w/ the salads as right now they could feed a table of 4.  But how many tables of 4 want to split the same salad?  Exactly.    And while I can accept the weird atmosphere changes as you try to find a \"theme\" to carry you to your next success.  How about stopping all of your investment and hard work on the Australian theme and going with a \"good food and comfortable atmosphere theme\".  I'm telling you - it could be a hit.    I'll try to check back twice a year or so to see how you're doing.  I believe in you Betty.  Let's make it happen."}
