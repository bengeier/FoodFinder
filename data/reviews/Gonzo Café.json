{"text":"Gonzo Cafe is pretty much my wife's and my favorite cafe / brunch spot in Montreal. The food is outstanding, the vibe is incredibly chill and the service is totally spot on. I highly recommend folks come and indulge in the Mac Benny with a coffee and fresh pressed orange juice; promise you won't be disappointed. All around, we have nothing but good things to say about this place. Highly endorsed and hope more people swing by as everything this place is doing is so solid."}

{"text":"We stopped here for late lunch after lots of bixi-bicycling throughout Montreal. Our sandwiches were fabulous! So tasty and made with fresh, flavourful ingredients. I had \"le chic\" chickpea sandwich and an iced latt√©. My kids had milkshakes and BLT sandwiches. We all thoroughly enjoyed everything! Cute location, open air, friendly staff, quiet street. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is my neighborhood goto joint for great coffee and brunch. I saw that they often hold block parties and gallery showings of local artists at their upstairs space. So when my daughter wanted to have a sweet 16 party I figured this would be a great place.   The owners were super helpful and was awesome in making the party happen. They were accommodating and made a great menu for the party. My daughter and friends were super happy with the whole event and was very thankful to Simon and Terry for putting this together.   This is not just a great breakfast place but also a great venue for parties and events. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Super delicious food, great service, and very cozy location. Overall, great experience."}
