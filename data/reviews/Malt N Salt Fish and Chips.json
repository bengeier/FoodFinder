{"text":"If you have a craving for fish and chips this is the go-to place. The fish is freshly battered and fried on order. We had the halibut and chips... the flavor and freshness were excellent. The chips are freshly cut and fried on premises. Unbeatable flavor. Give it a try!!!!"}
{"text":"This is our local go-to place for fish and chips.  They have good specials and the fish is delicious and crispy as are the chips.  Their slaw is really good too with a nice creamy dressing, which is something I am picky about.  The chips are nice and crispy and a half order is still a huge amount and usually more than I can finish.  We generally get the haddock which is the cheaper option and the filet is a nice generous size.  The only knock I have is their drinks are in a cooler and there is no option to get a glass with ice for it, so I always bring my own cup with ice to use.  I do suggest eating in instead of takeout if you have the time, as their chips are best when they are fresh and taking them home seems to steam them a bit in the box and they lose some of their crispness."}
{"text":"Delicious fish and chips! Perfect to satisfy a craving. My go to fish and chips spot in Pickering. Friendly staff and fast service"}
{"text":"Malt N Salt usually pops up in my restaurant searches for Pickering but this is my first time coming here, in my search for Fish & Chips on Good Friday. They were quite busy when I arrived shortly before 6pm and I assume the nine staff running around behind the counter were there for the Good Friday rush.

We ordered one of their Family Packs - 4 pieces of halibut, 2 orders of fries, 1 order of onion rings, 1 large gravy, and 1 large coleslaw. On this day, it was 39.95, 1.00 off because they weren't serving onion rings. I guess their fryers were too busy. We paid and got a number in the queue. Despite the fifteen or so orders ahead of us, they got the foods out pretty quickly. I could see each piece of fish being battered and dipped in ther fryer and the fries being done in another fryer. They had a good system going to manage the rush.

I observed all the orders, including ours, being boxed, wrapped, labeled, and boxed again. Very neat. Nice touch.

The fish was still crispy when we got back home. It had a nice light batter. The fries weren't as crispy, maybe from being wrapped too well, allowing it to sweat. They were still good. The gravy was thick and a little on the salty side. It could probably have been fixed with a little hot water. The coleslaw was creamy, the way I like it.

I enjoyed the meal and I was impressed with the efficiency of the service on such a busy day. It's definitely worth a return visit."}
{"text":"I had lunch at this place close to where I was working. 
It's a small place located in a plaza. The place looks old and feels like it hasn't been updated since the 80's. 
It had mostly fish and chips on the menu with a few different kind of fishes you can choose from. If you don't want fish, there's other options to choose from. 
The food was okay. The fish was crispy and the fries where okay. They were a little on the greasy side. 
The only thing that bothered me about the place is, they serve your fish and chips with package of tarter sauce, as you can see in the picture. If your gonna be a good fish and chips shop and want customers coming back. My advice is update the decor and serve the high quality fish with a homemade tarter sauce."}
{"text":"I had lunch today at Malt 'n Salt Fish and Chips.  It's in a little strip mall.

I had the haddock lunch special with a side of gravy.  The batter was light, which I like, but I found that the fish and fries tasted the same ... like grease.  I saw a fella hand cutting fries in the back so I know they are fresh but they didn't takes like potatoes.  I ate the fish out of the batter and it didn't have a lot of flavour.

I won't be back if I'm in Pickering."}
{"text":"Sometimes fish and chips is a problem on Fridays, with line ups, indifferent service and low quality in late afternoon. I stopped going to Jasper's when they gave me a bunch of small overcooked fish balls instead of a nice haddock fillet.

Now I go to Malt 'n Salt, a friendly place with no line ups and first rate fish and chips. It's in a tiny neighborhood plaza close to 401.

I order haddock, a sustainable catch promoted here . Halibut is available but I don't know its provenance. The proprietor is very careful and fussy about his fry technique, and so, the fish is always crispy but not overcooked.

Customers here always seem to be pleased. And that includes me!"}
