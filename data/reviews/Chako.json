{"text":"Their Kim tastes very well done. Compared to other places, their kimchi has an Actual taste. The food was very good. I would only recommend the lunch hours. Dinner is very pricey."}
{"text":"This was my first time here.  We visited for lunch - I have not been to a Korean bbq style restaurant before and for a first timer, I really enjoyed my experience.  It is all you can eat and the staff kept bringing out the meat and veggies.   Very tasty - something different from all those chain restaurants."}
{"text":"Went for my birthday tonight. Make sure you make a reservation, wait time was 45 minutes! My boys told the waiter it was a birthday celebration, he forgot, they did remember at other tables, never did mention it!  Food was delivered fast, but quite a few things the waiter forgot, they don't write anything down.  When asked for a new grill top they were replaced very quickly. No Bulgogi sauce, did I mention this is suppose to be Korean? Overall was better than a few others Korean b.b.q. places we have tried. Would go again, just make sure we reserve first and don't count on celebrating a birthday.."}
{"text":"We ended up in Chako looking for sushi, they didnt have sushi at lunch time bqt offered us Korean bbq instead.  
I do agree that is not 100% Korean, but let me tell you, it was good, well seasoned.
We went for lunch, so this review is based only on that, the selection  was limited on  side dishes.
We had a great experience with the service even though as I am reading other reviews saying otherwise.  Perhaps because it wasnt busy? or they improved?  Well, will need to go again. Next time I will try dinner instead."}
{"text":"I usually eat kbbq downtown but for the times I have to go north I go to chako. It is the same as other kbbq places. I can't complain. I love kbbq. Kbbq anywhere is good with me"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times for Korean bbq. Each time I felt like it was over-priced and the service was okay. This time because it was busy he gave us DOUBLE the order of everything we ordered and told us \"If you don't want it, it's okay leave it\". I guess because he didn't want to check up on us frequently incase we wanted to order more....It's kind of gross to leave food sitting out like that. People talking over it etc. We also found a little hair in our green peppers tray.

I commend the waiters otherwise, they are definitely hard working and prompt, but they can work on their attitude a little. A friend of mine and I got separate bills, he brought over the ATM machine while he held on to the bill- we were confused if TIP was added to the bill we couldn't remember from the last time. Assumed the price being so high it probably is so she didn't include tip in her transaction. As he ripped the slip off the machine he asked her \"Is everything ok? Why no tip?\". Kind of rude, especially since other people are around. We told him well you didn't even show us the bill AS YOU SHOULD so we can at least confirm. 
The food itself is great, but the room became extremely smokey after a while from all the grills.
For Korean bbq I've had a better experience at Seoul House on Enfield."}
{"text":"Pretty good food for a pretty good price. Service is decent. Just be aware of the 10% subcharge and you're set."}
{"text":"Love this place. Our server's name was Christine I believe? She was the best service we've ever gotten at Chakos, and we go often. The food is on par with the prices. Food is fresh and tastes good. Staff are friendly. Great place."}
{"text":"Being a foodie, I wanted to try something new - new food/new dining experience... So... I picked Chako Courtneypark Mississauga location. To be honest, it was not the cleanest place. So if you are a germophobe, you may want to think twice. The floors were slippery and my table greasy. Luckily, the food is being cooked at high heat! Very casual, and many people there were wearing shorts or jeans. The sushi and meats selection was limited. However, the sushi that we picked ( yam and spicy salmon) were excellent. The meats were very good and marinated well. Obviously, this place is not vegetarian friendly :). Dessert was either vanilla or strawberry for this Thursday night (wished they would have had green tea or red bean). Also, quite pricey ....$25 for a thursday night excluding tip. Would I go again? Sure...once in a while its a fun change...however, I have heard there are better locations/ similar restaurants which are cleaner and have better food selection."}
{"text":"yummmy i love chakos!! can't get enough of the meat sweats from over killing the protein here!! I guess the time me and my friend went wasn't as busy as it was between 6:30-7:30 on a friday and there seemed to be more stafff around so it was perfect, we had service instantly and was asked multiple times if we required anything more. I was impressed while during the feast, one of the hostesses came over and started placing a plastic wrap over my leather jacket!! I appreciated this as she noticed my leather jacket was expensive and covered it in the wrap to ensure i guess nothing splashed on it. Great service , love their food, i always come back :D"}
{"text":"It's $12.99 plus tax, and 10% service charge. It's not bad for eat all you can. The mango ice cream at the end was so good I have to ask for another serving after 3. I think lunch is 11:30 to 3."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends for an working outing and was quite happy with the food.  Reasonable prices and good food however I found the service a bit slow."}
{"text":"The decor of this restaurant is very  modern.

Our server was very helpful and really nice. He explained how everything worked. It is pretty much like any other Korean BBQ restaurant. The service is also quick as it should be for a Korean BBQ.

I really enjoyed the been sprouts, the beef, and the mango ice cream. I think the selection was sort of lacking in terms of different cuts of meats.

I would recommend this place at least for lunch or late night because it is relatively cheap at those times for an all you can eat. However, if you are looking for variety, I would avoid this place."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever experienced. Walked in with my husband and one year old on a Wednesday afternoon around 2pm. The restaurant seemed empty with only a few tables. The hostess and two waitresses were standing by the entrance doing nothing. When we walked in, they have suddenly disappeared to somewhere. One waitress told us to wait for a second. The hostess simply stared at us and walked to the sushi counter to pour water. Five minutes later, I stood up to ask when we can be seated, the hostess suddenly frowned and yelled \"I told you to wait a moment!\"  I was shocked completely. Then I said, I want to know whether there is a table for us. The hostess appeared to be more angry and yelled again that server was busy.  Then she went started to throw chairs around and slammed menus on the table. I couldn't stand her tone and said that I wanted to see the manager. Guess what, she CLAIMED that she was the manager. I told her there is no way that they should treat customers like this and we were extremely disappointed. She gave me a bunch of ridiculous looks like I was an idiot. I had no choice but leave and want to warn all people how bad the service is! Avoid at all cost. I really wish I could give zero stars"}
{"text":"First time trying Korean BBQ. I'd definitely go again but for dinner. I had lunch today and it was just meat and seafood as your main options. They add sushi to the dinner menu. 
Price wise it was decent. $14.99. You can eat all the meat until your hearts content. 
All the meat was marinating in this yummy, kind of spicy marinade. It comes with fresh veggies. Zucchini, green and red peppers. 
Waiter was MIA for most of the meal so we had to wave down random waiters/waitresses throughout our meal. Kind of annoying. 
All in all it was a fun experience and def would go back."}
{"text":"Poor customer service. We had a reservation for 2:15 and when we got there they said they put the reservation in for 2:30 which isn't a problem except for the rude way the hostesses dealt with the issue. The meal and serving staff were fast and accommodating so the meal itself was good. We had a great time until I left my phone at my table and I called to make sure they had it. The girl said no problem and they will hold onto it for me but when I got there they gave me an extremely hard time to get it back and ended with \"if you leave something here next time I'm going to sell it on eBay\" from the manager as he laughed at me. I worked in restaurants before and people are more than happy to return a phone or wallet to a customer. There won't be a next time at all for me here when there are other Korean barbecue places to go."}
{"text":"Let talk about the good things, 
The food tasted great WHEN it came 
the decor of the resturant was tasteful and it was a good enviroment
 
However there were lots of negatives.
First, the sushi that we ordered came when our bill came 
The hand rolls didn't come at all even though we called them multiple times
The waiter had this horrible attitude
The tips was included in the bill (which may be typical in many resturants but when you are getting this kind of crap service, thats forcing you to pay for service you didn't recieve)
and we were kicked out of the resturant because we sat for longer then an hour

Many would say that this is a good resturant but i would pass."}
{"text":"Came here tn since I was craving sushi and It was after 10, which seems is the usual time for most sushi places to close. Turns out it's mostly Korean bbq. It's all you can eat but during late night hours they don't offer sushi anymore. Only 4 types of meat, rice, salad, miso soup, 2 veggies, 2 ice creams and some cold dishes. I'm a vegetarian and was really disappointed in the meatless options. Almost as disappointed as I was that I couldn't have sushi. Service was ok, the lady was really nice but forgot to bring us Alot of things, we had to ask a few times before we got it. I almost wanted to go to Dennys across the way after we left cause I was still starving. I wouldnt return."}
{"text":"food is ok, not too much choices, but you have enough meat, very salty. service need improve, server doest looks like welcoming the guests, seems like a long day to them."}
{"text":"Since this location is the closest to my house, I generally go to this one more than their Richmond Hill location. 

Their prices are adequate for what you get. They also have specials each day for beverages. I love their option for late night dinner, which is after 10pm because that is usually when I get off work and I'm STARVING!

Their selection of dishes are generally good, although I do find it sometimes really salty. I don't have much to complain about the quality of the food but sometimes the service is really slow. Chako is generally really busy on the weekends so it is totally recommended that you make a reservation if you don't want to wait. Even sometimes on weekdays, if you want late night dinner, there's a huge line up for it as well. I experienced one time where I waited for my sushi order (I do not recommend their sushi to be honest, it is poor quality for those who eat sushi a lot at authentic restaurants) for probably 30 minutes. I ordered 4 hand rolls... And the hand roll came warm and the rice would just fall out of the hand roll as soon as I picked it up. We also tried their spicy salmon roll and it was soggy. 

Service isn't bad, I always see new faces but everyone is really friendly. They also have amazing memory... They sometimes don't even need to write down what you want to order! 

The atmosphere is lovely. It's dark and everyone is pretty separated. Just a suggestion to not wear thick sweaters or anything that you don't want to smell like BBQ after! (:"}
{"text":"Went for lunch.. was told that we could only change grill plates once... so food cooked off the grill plates were often black.

Right away, we were given many plates of food and told 'its ok if we do not eat it, as long as you haven't touched it, we don't have to charge you and can take it back\". Pretty scary thought that they could take it back, and serve it to someone else. I'm glad that we were the first guests for that day, but scared for everyone else.

Towards the end, we were served ice cream, and they came in disposable cups. Some were in round/scooped shapes, but quite frozen... and *some looked flat and frozen*... was again told that its ok if we do not eat it, as long as we don't touch it, they can take it back... which led me to the conclusion that they likely treat the ice cream like their meats, and take it back if customers don't eat it, and serve it to others. 

Overall, would not visit again. Waiter was alright, not rude, decent service... but where are the standards???"}
{"text":"Chakos is the best Korean bbq restaurant I've ever been to. Their weekend menu is better than their weekday. It is a little more expensive but the weekend menu has double the amount of items you can order. The meat and veggies are all very fresh and you can cook it to your liking on the grill in the middle of your table. And to top it all off, there's mango ice cream for desert. I use to go there two-three times a month. Love it! :)"}
{"text":"Food is mediocre, ambiance is mediocre, staff that work there aren't quite all *there* if you know what I mean.

This Chako is connected to Wasabi, and twice in a row now, the front hostess have directed me to the Wasabi side when I clearly tell her \"I'M HERE FOR KOREAN BARBEQUE\". She smiles and nods, then takes me to Wasabi. After I stop her from going any further she laughs and apologizes. Uhh... 

So getting seated was a challenge, but eating the food was a challenge too. There was one waiter who kept on staring and coming by to ask how the food was every 10 minutes. I appreciated the enthusiasm, but he was starting to disturb my meal and I had to constantly try not to choke on my food and tell him the food is good. He will go back to his corner and the staring would continue. 

Also, I may add, once a waitress did not have a notepad and she was trying to remember all of our orders (like 10 different things). She didn't seem like she could remember everything so I suggested for her to write it down, and she told me she had an amazing memory. Well, not so amazing considering she forgot half of the stuff I ordered. Ugh. As if I didn't already predict that. 

At the end, nobody came to clean our grill even though we were asked so frequently about the food. The grill was completely burned."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a Korean BBQ restaurant for a while and tried this place for the first time.  Pretty good place,  very simple menus but tasty and great to have local."}
{"text":"Ordered soup, rice, bean sprouts and fried tofu which all came in small portions. Only ordered beef and short ribs but my order came with two extras I didn't ask for, chicken and pickled radish. Funny thing is that the two dishes were used to lift the stove ring up. 

The beef and short ribs came in two tiers which surprised me as to how generous the AYCE place is when I'm dining alone. I thought they would give you one dish of each item picked and order more later since waitress didn't ask quantity when she took the oder. It wasn't before long I started to worry if I'd be charged the extra $5 for wasting a dish uneatened. In the end I was able to finish all but the chicken as it was too salty and too thickly cut. Luckily I wasn't charged extra for the leftovers. 

The 10% tip was included in the bill, but interestingly, they did the calculations after tax. In conclusion you're paying more than 10% as you're tipping the tax. Not sitting too happy as I did the cooking myself, but acceptable since I didn't get charged for the leftovers."}
{"text":"Anyone who thinks this is Korean BBQ has absolutely no idea what Korean BBQ is.  This is a Chinese bastardization of it."}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming here for lunch. My boyfriend and i seem to indulge in the side dishes rather than the meat itself haha. Meat was marinated well, we usually order the beef and short ribs, and the side dishes and dessert taste really good too. However, sometimes we have to remind the waiter 2 times that we ordered extra kimchi or tofu but it wasn't the biggest inconvenience. Never had a bad experience in this restaurant though"}
{"text":"Horrible. 

I went with a big group... Around 20 people. They took advantage of some of the local guys who don't usually eat at asian buffets and gave each of us a bowl of rice before we placed our order. Most of us was filled after eating the rice, and we didn't have a choice because they said that a fine would be collected for each leftover item. They also didn't listen to our orders and gave us a ton of veggies. The meat came after a long time because I rushed them. Anyway the place is so cheap. Never going back. Don't go with a big group of non-asians because they're just gonna take advantage of you."}
{"text":"Went there couple times. Love the food, really enjoy the bbq and simple sushi. They provided all you can eat dessert too. Totally recommended. The meats are fresh. The only thing i dont like about this place is you will be stink like a smoke, still I enjoy the food very much."}
{"text":"Great food - terrible service. When our waiter finally came by, he started listing the available meats and asking if we wanted them. Aware of the $5 charge per leftover plate, we asked if we could each order separately so there wasn't any waste. He responded: \"No, I don't have time for that\". We were completely taken aback, and he left without taking drink orders until we flagged him down again. Food was great, but then it took a while to get our bill, which had the 10% auto gratuity on it. Since it was below substandard service I didn't tip extra. Our waiter asked \"You don't want to tip me for bringing all this food? The 10% is shared between everyone, anything else is just for me.\" Not only was the service terrible, but he then had the audacity to get mad that we didn't tip on top of the imposed gratuity."}
{"text":"Excellent Korean Barbeque Restaurant. It's very new, so the Decor and Atmosphere is very nice. The staff are very helpful and the selection of food is excellent and the place is very clean. They even have a late night menu - $10 on weekdays after 10pm. It's also open late. You can also order sushi as part of your all you can eat but that is not available on the discounted late night menu. I've been there 3 times and never have been disappointed except I can never get enough. Next time you have a craving for BBQ Beef, Ribs, Chicken and Seafood, Check this place out. Your stomach and pocket will not complain."}
{"text":"Best place for a late night feast!
Beef short ribs are thick and juicy."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Service was good!  and the best kimchi ive had to date. The sushi, however is mediocre at best but whatever, we weren't here for the sushi. The korean appetizers were okay.  Fried tofu was a let down but I swear, that kimchi made up for all of it. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"First time at Chako, ordered the meats and sushi accordingly.  Same person was serving few tables around - once completed, I asked for the bill.  I received the bill and, there was no mention of mandatory gratuity on Menu (as this should be highlighted, if you are to have mandatory changes to service) yet, the bill was charged for 10% on bill (it was the lady and I, only) and I did all the cooking.  

So the person who came with the bill , wasn't the very same as served...advising that the \"service change\" was for the kitchen and anything I gave above, would be paid to the server.  I was totally confused how the revenue model worked($21.99/pp for weekend evening).  I thought, the cost of the buffet AYCE covered the \"costs\" of kitchen (since, I was cooking what was the kitchen doing?) and usually, gratuity was left to me depended on service received.  Service was minimal and \"mandatory gratuity\" didn't reflect that service - my first and last time to this location and maybe this Resto.  Rating 1/10."}
{"text":"The food was flavorful and I loved the variety on the menu. The staff were also friendly & polite. The reason why I'm only giving it 3 stars is because of the washrooms. They are very dirty. Two of the stalls were occupied with extremely dirty wash buckets. The washrooms looked like they hadn't been cleaned in weeks. Sorry but this is a game changer for me. There was plenty of staff around so really no excuse."}
{"text":"3.5/5

I came here after there was a long wait over at Wok of Fame and this was walk in.

It's really nicely done and it's connected to a buffet called wasabi (maybe i should try it out)

Came here for the weekend dinner all you can eat, it served mussels, calamari, fish, and your standard korean bbq meats and side dishes. They also had extras I don't recall. They have very limited sushi variety but I'm fine with tempura and cali roll :)

Strawberry daiquiri was really good, and service was good.

I wouldn't drive here from toronto, but if you're in the neighbourhood after watching a movie or putting edge try it out!"}
{"text":"Best Korean BBQ in the area.   The restaurant is clean, spacious, and accomodating.  The food is good, and the service was great."}
{"text":"Don't bother coming for their lunch bento boxes. Although Chako is ok for AYCE KBBQ, I tried the boxes for the first time with a group of our friends (8 people). They told us that we couldn't all order the boxes since their kitchen couldnt handle it, half of us ordered sushi specials and the other half bento boxes. My box has 3 pieces of stale sushi, a teriyaki chicken that tasted like the sauce was added after and was definitely not the standard teriyaki flavour, and rice that was mushy on the inside. Other people noted that the cucumber sushi was stale, and overall the food was just pretty bad. Skip here and head down to Made in China if you want a cheap lunch special."}
{"text":"Went to Chako for dinner with some friends of mine who live in Mississauga and were regulars at this restaurant.

The food at Chako was very good! All the different meats and seafood were very well seasoned, especially the thinly sliced beef. The vegetables were average, since they weren't seasoned and there weren't many options. The side dishes made up for that though; I really liked the tofu and the seaweed!

The ambiance of the venue looked pretty trendy and clean. The service here was truly excellent. Our main server was very attentive and was very fast to help us and so were the other staff. Also the grills were switched in less than a minute, so we could get cooking almost instantly after each round. 

Chako is definitely worth a visit as the food is good, the service excellent and the restaurant itself great!"}
{"text":"Place was pretty full on a Friday night.  Waited 15 min.  Food was plentiful and average a best.  The self cooking was a different experience. Sushi was meh!  Gonna try other Korean places for comparison"}
{"text":"I'm a regular here whenever I'm in the mood for AYCE kbbq. It's my go-to place and in my opinion, one of the best places in Toronto for AYCE kbbq. I'm from North York and I usually make the trip here because everything is very decent.
The ambience is oriented towards a modern feel with the dark notes and furniture that they use. As soon as you get out of your car and walk towards Chako, the smell of barbecued meats will make their way towards your nose.
I really love the AYCE weekend dinner menu since they have such a variety of available meats that you can choose from. It's extensive compared to every other place that I've been to. 
When I eat here, I mostly end up eating the chako select beef, chicken, short ribs, spicy salmon roll, california roll, seaweed salad, kimchi, radish, tofu, and grilled pineapple. I just sort of stock up on these and have a good time here with it. (:
One thing that I've noticed is that their desserts are becoming more and more gross. When I came here to eat yesterday, my green tea ice cream was covered in FROST and it was not creamy in any way. Thoroughly disappointed - it was like eating a frozen hard green tea flavored ice ball.
Nevertheless, I will still come here. The mango ice cream was still creamy and fresh.
BEWARE - if you are going on a date, you will smell like kbbq afterwards."}
{"text":"It's the same type of AYCE Korean grill houses as anywhere else.  It's even the same stackable plastic square dishes as every other place!

Meats:  
Kalbi short ribs are cut too thick
Chicken tasted a bit off
Pork was chewy 
There was another meat here and I can't remember what it was!

Seafood: 
Squid was quite good! (Don't overcook!) 
Shrimp were larger than I expected and again, quite good! 
Fish was abit strange tasting and fell apart so easily after grilling 
Mussels don't bother

Veggies:
Zucchini sliced way too thick
Red peppers were good but thin
Green peppers ditto 
Pineapple were way too thick 

So overall, it's what you'd expect, sub-par food but you have the fun off making it all yourself.  Another plus is that they have the advanced grill system that sucks the smoke in so you don't leave smelling like you live in a bbq pit smoker.  

The entrance is in the Wasabi restaurant.  I guess the original restaurant was too big so they divided it into two restaurants.  

We had a coupon for buy one get one free so we went knowing it would be a great deal.  However, without the coupon I doubt I would go back."}
{"text":"Read as 3.5.The Korean barbeque portion is just like any other place but they have a great selection for dinner! The tiger shrimp is a must try! They are inconsistent with the thickness of their meat but overall it was good. 

The sushi lacked in many places. The California rolls looked sloppy, the rice vinegar made the rice taste cheap, and their spicy salmon is bland mush - just to name a few things. The sushi portion wasn't horrible but they used low quality fish which really disappointed me. Would come back again maybe but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"STEP YOUR GAME UP CHAKO - We come here all the time but usually in groups of no more then a few couples. This weekend we had a table of like 25 people and they gave us one waiter. We were very squished together and no one was getting anything they were actually ordering, instead they would pile up a bunch of stuff we didn't want. The table was so covered with things that there was no room to actually put your plate in front of you to eat. A one point my plate was moved to the side so 5 bowls of tofu could be placed there lol. We tried to turn things away and were told to \"not worry\" Sushi orders went ignored.. and when they finally did come there was no rhyme or reason to it so no one knew what belonged to anyone. Drinks other then water took 40 minutes to arrive and had to be asked for several times. Numerous orders of non meat items such as sushi, miso soups, salads went completely ignored and never came even after asking several times. Our waiter seemed annoyed with our requests because he was being pulled in 100 different directions. I don't blame him but why he didn't go and speak to someone and say I need help on this table is beyond me. We shouldn't have to tell him he needed it. There was never a time where the waiter was like ok what would you like face to face.. you had to beg him over to you. I think the funniest thing we noticed was that our waiter was also working other tables in the room on top of our mess LOL.

With a large group there is an automatic gratuity charge of 15% so they made at least $100 extra from us as a whole but had us sitting there feeling like we were being a nuisance and barely eating.

This place is always busy and they seem like they're making the money they want so they're not bothering to make sure that the service is up to even an average standard in these cases OR that their staff is being treated properly. I don't like to complain at restaurants I understand we're all people and not everything is perfect but this was nutso caputso! Especially when I don't even have the option to say horrendous service I'm not tipping."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places in Scarborough. The customer service and decor are excellent and who can complain about AYCE meat?! Definitely recommend this place. Be warned, gratuity is included in the bill."}
{"text":"Chako has excellent customer service - they are so speedy! Plus, they check up on you frequently. I always go for All You Can Eat and I find their dinner selection is better. Also some sushi available. This is one of the better places for Korean BBQ as their selection is wider than some other restaurants (however, weekend dinner has the best menu and is the priciest). 

RECOMMENDED: Lamb, Beef, Short Ribs, Salmon
RECOMMENDED APPS: Tofu, Seaweed Salad, Soup

TIP: to save, go after 10 pm for their late night special. Selection is not as wide as regular dinner, but it will save you a couple of bucks!"}
{"text":"I admit, I came with high expectations and boy, was I sorely disappointed. We came for lunch and we got served right away. The waitress was nice, although not very cheerful but she did refill our waters pretty quickly. Most of the food was meat which is great for a carnivore-lover like me but I was disappointed in the taste. I love chicken but theirs just turned me off. Everything was just either bland or too salty. The only condiments we had was soy sauce. I'm not sure if you have to order for more. My friend that I went with hardly ate anything so this venture was a failure for both of us. 

At the end, we got green tea ice cream in these tiny crappy little plastic bowls although the waitress was nice enough to give us the mango one too as we left. There's a lot more options for dinner and during the weekend. 

Apparently, there's a service charge so we got charged $14.99 each PLUS the waitress expected tips. It was quite awkward and a bit presumptious with her waiting for it beside our table. 

WARNING: We didn't finish five plates, but thank goodness it was lunch or else we would have been charged $3.00 each! 

Not coming back here."}
{"text":"Pretty nice place to go out in a lager group but after a while the bad ventilation and smell of burnt food burns your lungs. I personally prefer Korean grill house over this one but the selection here is much better and the cuts of meat were really good. Service was okay nothing amazing but it's a busy place so I would recommend making reservations if your wanting to go in a large group."}
{"text":"I would definitely call for reservations if you want to go there on the weekend. Other than that the food looks fresh and spiced nicely unlike Korean Grill.  I usually show up when I go to pac mall."}
{"text":"Very nice facilities. I had a good waiter, good quality of sushi/meats etc. Very nice atmosphere, would recommend. It is a little pricier than grillhouse etc, but you get your money's worth."}
{"text":"In the couple times that I had been here, the server was always attentive and the service was quick. I love the food, especially the short ribs and zucchini. The only reason why I didn't give 5 stars is because occasionally they would mix up some orders (ex. Short ribs when I asked for beef). Ice cream quite good also. 
Located in a not so busy area, plenty of parking available."}
{"text":"Worst Chako experience ever. I usually dine in Markham/Scarborough and this was my first time at this location. Sat down to a dirty table. Our grill still had food on it and our waiter just brushed it off to the side. Rushed us when we ordered. Asked for a grill change but took forever. Got our dessert orders all mixed up. And the final straw was when they put a mandatory 10% service charge and after we paid that amount our server told us that the 10% does not go towards him and was mad. WTF. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Worse than the worst...bad food, bad service, how dare they call this Korean bbq? No lettuce no Korean bbq sauce, no quality. The pork is way thicker than it should be. Worst experience. Won't come back anymore."}
{"text":"Over rated over priced and only to fill the glutinous appetite. The hype outweighs the concept here. Not trying to cook on a dinner out."}
{"text":"The food and service here is great! My family and I came here on a Thursday night, and once our waiter knew it was our first time, he brought us a selection of items on their menu. He was very nice and accommodating.
  The meat itself was really flavourful and tender, the chicken being my favourite. And I love the fun DIY cooking method of the built in grill. 
  Overall I really enjoyed my experience at Chako, and I will definitely be coming back. I would recommend this restaurant for sure! Except maybe not to vegetarians..."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy yummy! 

I came here for the lunch BBQ special, it was $11.99 per person. It's a pretty good price. There was four meat choices: pork, ribs, chicken, and sliced spicy beef. They were delicious, my personal favourite are the ribs. They had their appetizers/cold dishes. There wasn't anything special, but it wasn't gross. 

Overall service was above average, the manager was a bit pushy and bothered, but the staff were friendly and helpful. The only thing that really bothered me was that they didn't have good venting system, because smoke was everywhere.

I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone, prepare for yummy food but also be prepared walking out smelling like your grill!"}
{"text":"They've increased the prices by a dollar from what I've seen.

Anyway, this place is average for a KBBQ place. If there were better ones near me, I wouldn't be going here.

The beef is definitely my favourite, but that's just because I'm a beef person. Next the short ribs (which are usually a bit too fatty for my liking), and the pork, tied for second.

This place is really up and down with the cuts of meat they give you. Some days are better than others. I wish they had a bit more consistency.

Either way, still very reasonable for the price. Make sure to douse your meat in the BBQ sauce, or it will probably taste too plain."}
{"text":"The food here is very basic, nothing special and doesn't taste very good. It's also not the cleanest place...but it's all you can eat. The service is not bad. It's very dark and smokey inside. Overall, Chako is mediocre and the amount of money you will spend here, you can get a really good meal elsewhere. I wouldn't go back, but I guess it's one of those places you should try once just for the experience of a mainstream Korean BBQ."}
{"text":"Been a couple of times for a birthday celebration. Service was good and fun. Food was great except for dessert. Also wish the place was cleaner. Four stars because the waiter was fun and food was great."}
{"text":"Shut down until further noticed due to management failed to prevent infestation"}
{"text":"They really dropped their quality. You are basically ordering fat and no meet. Just check out the picture I uploaded of their beef, it looks like nasty white sludge. I didn't care about the bad service, but now that they have terrible food there is no point of going."}
{"text":"I travel 1-2x per year on business to Korea and I love the Korean food especially the BBQ!!!

Chako is probably the best well rounded Korean BBQ around. The ambiance is very nice creating a north american/asian fusion feel. Food quality is very good but not great."}
{"text":"If you want to be around a swarm of Asian people, then this place is for you. REALLY.  LOL! But aside from that, not that it is a negative thing, the place will leave you smelling like BBQ. Fake sushi but good. I love how I order here compared to the other shitty Korean BBQ Grill whatever the hell their called. \"Ummm I want everything please\", then they fill your table up. Plus they have dessert! and Mussels! LMAO I know it's random but I think that is a plus.

Service is actually good! They don't IGNORE you when you need something which I like. I've been here dozen of times and I can't get sick of it."}
{"text":"I think I went for the AYCE lunch menu. Meats are marinated properly and taste pretty good, but the squid was a nightmare to chew, and I didn't like the fish. Perhaps what I really needed was a little bit of alcohol to go with my lupper. I think I will try the dinner BBQ next time based on what the reviews are saying."}
{"text":"Affordable price for buffet I would say , if you do at the right time you'll enjoy it 100%"}
{"text":"We were looking for an all you can eat Korean BBQ place somewhere close. Seeing as how we were in brampton we didn't have much choice. After checking out the previous reviews we thought we would give it a try. 

Low and behold, it wasn't the greatest, but I also don't think we will return again. Some negative points to note were:
- Kimchi kind of looks like it was leftover pieces, not full cabbage pieces.
- beef pieces were too big, mostly fatty
- calamari was a bit too fishy 
- bean sprout side dish has a funky taste to it, we usually love the sides but didn't bother to get seconds this time 
- everything was sort of marinated in the same sauce (beef,chicken, etc)
- tea was not a covered drink menu, only water is complimentary 
- waiter brought our bill to the table before we asked, even though we were 1 of 3 people in a very empty restaurant.
- nobody came to clean our grill

Some pros:
- the miso soup tasted good 
- one server we had was very attentive and pleasant, the other one named Walter who helped her out was not as good. He was he one who brought our bill too soon 
- 12.99 is not bad for a lunch time special, good variety in meats 
- they offered zucchini and red pepper as dishes to order, good balance with veggies 

Again, overall was good but I don't think we would return."}
{"text":"When I go to Chako, I only get 2 things, their short ribs and zucchini.

Compared to other Korean BBQ AYCE places, I like their short rib marinade a lot more! There's more flavour and it's a bit sweeter.

Weekends are a little more pricey, but have more food options including sushi, which take a century to come out, so be sure to order it first! 

Usually packed on weekends, so there could be a bit of a wait. Service here is hit and miss."}
{"text":"I love Korean BBQ! Never disappoints, plenty of grub, fresh food, variety. I also love how you cook everything yourself. It's fun! Ps try the cold tofu, it's my favorite here!"}
{"text":"i wish i could give this place a 0 star.  so my experience at this shitty ass place was soooo bad that i cannot even describe it. everything except the mango ice cream was terrible. don't  even get me started with the service, they absolutely treated me and my friends like shit.  i highly suggest that you do not go to this place. pls don't go u will waste ur money on crap."}
{"text":"3/5 stars because of the rude hostess (short, hair up, glasses). 

I've been coming to this location for at least 6/7 years and last night was def an experience to remember - but not in a good way.  I reserved a table for 10pple at 8:45pm last night (Dec 29).  8/10 people were present before we were seated.  The hostess repeatedly asked if all 10 pple would be showing up, and I repeatedly said yes. We even went as far as saying that others were parking or stuck in traffic.  The hostess then responded  \"because if only 8 people show up I can still charge you for 10 pple\".  Again, I said yes, that all ten would be showing up. 

I called her out for being rude and asked why she possibly thinks its okay to speak to us in a threatening tone.  She apologized and said \"I didn't mean to scare you\".  Told her I wasn't scared at all but that she shouldn't be speaking to customers rudely and needs to change her tone.  Hostess said it's because sometimes people book a table for 10 with the intentions of only having 7 people come in.  Regardless, I don't know who she thinks she is for making up a bullshit rule like that.   

If I was to rate the hostess alone she would get 1.5 stars, only because she picked up my friend's scarf when it fell on the floor.  However, our server Angela was caring and attentive, bringing this rating up to 3/5 stars. 

Management, please remind your hostess that her job is to *welcome* people, not threaten them."}
{"text":"I would've given them a 4 or 5 BUT....

Please be AWARE and CAREFUL as their grills may have leftover bristles from the brushes they use to clean them!!!!!!!!

I started grilling my meats and veggies....as we were waiting we munched on their cold side dishes (pickled radish, kimchi, bean sprouts & tofu). I went for a bite in the zucchini and felt something pointy....I thought it was a piece of the chopsticks that might have broken off. I was chewing slowly and carefully so I don't hurt myself and pulled out a piece of METAL from my mouth!!! It was very tiny...probably the size of half a sewing needle (I wish I had taken a picture of it, I was just caught up in the moment and forgot). So I obviously alerted the staff and showed them what it was....they knew right away it was from the brushes they use to wash  the grill. 

The manager (I assume) came out to speak to me and apologized for what happened. She explained why and how it might have ended up there, which I understand but still not cool! She offered us a free drink and received 10% off our bill. All staff were very nice and extremely apologetic....it was an accident that shouldn't have happened... I could've hurt myself or worse...a child might have eaten it...

I don't even wanna comment on anything else cuz it's so important that everyone is AWARE so please be careful!!!"}
{"text":"There isn't much to choose from the lunch menu, but overall the service and food was great."}
{"text":"First visit was the late night special that starts at 10:30pm.  Same price as lunch and the same menu items.  Best thing to order are the Korean short ribs (kalbee), chicken in a curry marinade and pork.  Basa fillets I'd leave alone , as they're Asian catfish and among the dirtiest!  Great atmosphere, lots of parking and very clean.
There are daily specials as well such as $3.50 beer (domestic) night on Fridays."}
{"text":"Don't go for lunch it's a waste, I've been for dinner and it's much better more selection like sushi,extra meats and stuff. Lunch needs more stuff. The grill we had only half lit and waitress said it's cause of the a/c vent. They should find a way to redirect it or something also salt and pepper on tables would be great."}
{"text":"The service at location has gone up significantly, quality of food is OK but at least consistent. 

Most of the time we find ourselves here for theirs he night special (we usually just go for the Ribs, Chicken, beef and seafood). 

Dinner menu is good for the AYCE salmon filet, and the gateway sushi rolls, every now and then. Good for when you're want both sushi and KBBQ, if you're not craving for sashimi.

Not a bad joint, as west GTA/Mississauga doesn't offer many choices for KBBQ. Much better than the Korean Grill House chains downtown. Unfortunately not comparable to the Chako locations in Scarborough and Richmond Hill. 

However as of January 4th 2015, it seems this location is no longer offering late night. Boo!"}
{"text":"Chako is my go-to place for KBBQ. The only problem is the price. It's pretty expensive during dinner time, but when late-night menu starts there's no sushi! The sushi is what I really enjoy here. It's fresh and tasty. I usually eat mostly just beef and the beef here is very good. The only thing that puts me off is paying almost $25 for a meal of beef and sushi. 

If you are only craving KBBQ and you don't want to wait until late-night, I would recommend another KBBQ place. There are many close to Chako that offer KBBQ that is just as good. This is a pretty good place if you have money to spend for the dinner menu though."}
{"text":"Not Korean. Kimchi is all wrong. Marinades are all wrong. They don't give you lettuce or any leafy greens for wraps. No fermented bean paste (ssam jang). This is imitation Korean BBQ. 

This place reminded me of hotel food in Varadero, Cuba. The food was nothing like what they were supposed to taste like. 

It's just like in a movie where aliens try to act like humans, but cannot get all the fine details and nuances. 

Thumbs down. Way down. It was cheap though."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner the other night with my friend and we weren't overly impressed this time. It had been awhile since I had been here and I used to really like it, but I feel that it has gone downhill. The food just wasn't as good as I remember. The short ribs were pretty fatty and the sushi took awhile to get to our table. It's still a great option when you want to fill up on lots of meat for one price."}
{"text":"Food is amazing here! I love coming here with family and friends for healthy all you can eat options. It's such a fun and unique experience 

Tip: after 10pm, they offer a discounted all you can eat price"}
{"text":"Are you into non-authentic Korean style Korean BBQ? By that I mean if you want to experience REAL Korean BQQ (as you would expect if you go to Korea), please go elsewhere because Chako is clearly (and cleverly) meant to serve a different group of people. 

While the food is average at best, but for the price you pay, it is hard to find any other place with a better bang for your buck. Do note that ventilation seems to be a bit of an issue so if you are no good with smokey places, then this might not be for you."}
{"text":"Food is great but the prices have inflated too much to the point the late night option isn't worth it anymore. Flavour of cold dishes is great, the meat is delicious and well marinated. Service is great - but be warned, on your bill, they will have already charged you tips. The waiters will also mention this to you upon paying your bill. Always leave satisfied and full."}
{"text":"Good spot. 
Great atmosphere.
Lunch deal is good as well. 
They could change/add their appetizers a bit however.
I have been to hundreds of Korean BBQ such as this. 
What I found odd was that there is no vent above you - i.e. the tables. 
So, if you are not into BBQ and others are doing BBQ, you will come out of restaurant smelling like a kitchen help person. 

I would most def visit this place again but this time."}
{"text":"Damn, true to Louis C.K's words, I ain't done here until I hate myself. Honestly, i've been here more times than I'd care to admit, but I've never been here for anything other than the late night special (EL cheapo mode, I know). But for their late night special they've got a good selection of meeats and pineapples, pineapples, and pineapples. Their meats are well marinated, and the flavours comes through quite nicely. Oh ya did I mention pineapples? Make sure to get some of those bad boys and grill em up when you get tired of eating meats :D"}
{"text":"Chako was a nicer atmosphere and fancier inside than the other KBBQs in the area. Went back after not going for a while and it was a bad experience. The BBQ stuff was my bad, some dishes a lot of fatty cuts (and not in the good way). The sushi was bad, and they kept forgetting to bring items we ordered. At the end the guy who seated us comes back and said there is already a 10% surcharge added for the chefs and you have to tip the waiter on top. First of all, it's Korean BBQ...I am the chef. I get it...people need to prep stuff but that is included in the price of the meal, and when you tip usually the kitchen gets tipped out as well. It was rude how he said it and I have never been to a place that says that, some Asian places include the 10% but that is the tip and they often won't accept more even when you try to add it on."}
{"text":"Service has vastly improved from previous years. If you are craving unlimited meat this is the place to be. Warm rice with a perfectly charred piece of sliced pork with some radish on top ... what could be better!! 

Pro tip: Remember to tell them to change the grill when it starts to get black ... yes they do that so you don't have to keep grilling on a brunt up surface."}
{"text":"Good restaurant for cooking your own food! Meat is very flavourful and tender especially the chicken, and beef. Tofu was really good too. Less choices than most spots, but the foods still pretty good."}
{"text":"Went for a birthday party with about 15 people  on a Sat night.    Cost was $26.99 + 12% automatic gratuity + 13% tax.....the server asks what you want from their menu and they serve loads of meat and veggies to grill up.....veggies are all raw and meats lack seasoning and flavour.   We alltried pork, beef, chicken, shrimps, calamari, Ox tongue and lamb.  They were all tender but not very tasty.  Sushi is very good though and fresh.    We had a lot of meat go to waste, but luckily we weren't charged for wastage.   Their menu states that every dish not eaten cost an extra $5.    Calamari and fresh fish fillets were very good.    Shrimps had head and feet on making it difficult to eat.    Seating is so tight that it is extremely difficult to eat without hitting your neighbour's elbows and dropping food.    After cooking food yourself, you end up smelling like bbq: not recommended for really dressing up or white clothing as the food can get a little messy.    Was expecting much better for a first time Korean Bbq experience....definitely wont go back or try this style of diy cooking ever again.    The party I was in pretty much all said the same thing.    Only thing that was good was the service which was quick and efficient and polite!    Its alright if you have never tried this diy cooking, but it isn't worth repeating especially for the high cost.   Would of preferred to have a plated meal where the food is cooked for you."}
{"text":"the food is great the service is great i give it a 5 star ill be back for sure everything is fresh"}
{"text":"KBBQ in Toronto is meh as fuck but this place is the meh-est of the meh. I don't care how extensive your menu is if everything on it tastes like chalk. The Chako in Richmond Hill used to be good when it first open but everything since then went to shit. I don't even bother ordering the sushi. Compared to the KBBQ in Cali: They have barely any side dishes. Meat quality is not worth the price. It's rubbery and tough, and no matter how you cook it, it's hard to chew. If you think the marinated meat here tastes anywhere close to good, then I pity your virgin taste buds. They often cut the pieces too thick and it tastes like it's been sitting out. 

Don't get me started on service. My friends and I are speaking English so the middle-aged female manager thinks we don't understand Canto and rudely tells our server right in front of us to get us to leave because our time is up. First of all, we had 20 minutes left on our 2 hour seating limit. Second, your restaurant had plenty of empty tables so it's not as if any potential customers are waiting. 

If it was up to me, I wouldn't have even come here after it closed down for food safety violations (insect infestation) in 2014."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch twice on the Korean BBQ side, around 3PM each time, and I'll probably go back again.

They're pretty inconsistent with both the food and the service. Both times I went the place was almost empty, The first time the waiters were hard to get ahold of, never refilled my water, and got a lot of our orders wrong. The second time was the total opposite, the waiters got everything right, and were always checking up on us.

The food is a lot like the service, but not as extreme. 80% of the time the meat is properly marinated, and tastes good, then you get a batch which is just plain tasting."}
{"text":"2/5 for food, service was alright could be way better, had to wait 15 mins to pay because of lack of machines.

It was my first time and I didn't know what flavours/mix ins to put in ...obviously asked for some tips and the waiter either didn't understand me or didn't know. 

Either way, it was fine - I tried the squid and chicken. I found it to be bland and taking a long time  to cook despite putting soy sauce and bbq sauce it as bland! I asked for lemon to spruce it up. The kimchi was good as was the tofu. 

I'm not sure I like the sauces they offer for flavour it was bland, took a long time.

Mango ice cream was good.

The waiter when paying said the gratuity was split among everyone and that it's not just for him and that if we wanted- we could give HIM something  - um like you want extra on top of substantial gratuity despite being a party of only three ?! Awkward and undeserved because of the service"}
{"text":"Being owned by Chinese people you know you won't get anything authentic. The very FIRST chako around silverstar was actually more of a Japanese grilling experience, with good quality food, but I suppose they figured that Kbbq has lower costs, and will allow them to earn more money. What makes them unique (as far as I know) is that in addition to kbbq they also offer sushi items. Though they are nothing exceptional, considering it's part of the AYCE menu it is still pretty good. (I recommend the spicy salmon roll.) They offer the typical meats and seafood (with mussels which is rare), and all are very good. Special props to the seafood 'cause they usually suck at other kbbqs.  On several occasions where I went I was never pressured to leave, or over order and was able to leave feeling full and happy. Two complaints though is the service and the thirst that follows the experience. One of the male managers is quite useless. Me and my group of friends asked him to divy up the bill and he said, \"ask your waiter to do it.\" That just showed a great deal of irresponsibility in my opinion. Also while eating and after leaving the restaurant I found myself drinking water constantly, which should say something about the msg/sodium content in the food.  Overall a decent place, with good price. Good to visit with big group of people."}
{"text":"It took much longer to cook the meat compared to other Korean BBQ. The burners couldn't be turned up any higher. The most disappointing was our bill. We were charged $3 for 16 month old baby who barely ate."}
{"text":"SERVERS, management can't take your tips except under certain circumstances. If what you claim is true (see below), you can make a complaint to the Ministry of Labour. Check https://www.ontario.ca/page/new-laws-employees-tips  

For everyone else, beware of auto gratuity even for small groups. When they type the amount into the debit/credit card machine, it already includes 10% tip and then machine asks for more tip. Server said management gets the 10% and anything on top is the server's. Also some discrepancy between what servers say according to yelpers. 

Food was ok. Nothing spectacular but it wasn't bad. Probably wouldn't come back again."}
{"text":"This place is decent for the amount you pay, but don't expect super friendly staff and service.  The place seems to be fairly understaffed and for some reason the food prep takes a lot longer than expected.  We were forced to wait on extra orders of meat for 15-20 minutes at a time and the sushi took even longer to come out.

When we asked the staff for water, we were either looked at as if we did something wrong or they completely forgot that we asked them and choose to ignore it.  The food doesn't seem to be the issue here, but more than likely the unfriendly servers.

Overall the food is pretty decent and you definitely get your value since you can eat as much as you like.  I would probably only come back if I was really craving KBBQ and there were no other options available."}
{"text":"food?
pro: lamb and salmon are reaaaally good.
Con: short rib is too fatty and the chicken is not properly cut. the rice for sushi is not good.

Service:
Pro: the waiter is friendly.
Con: The voice for calling the waiting customers' name is too low.  You will be charged twice for the tips. One for the restaurant and the other for the waiter.

Environment:
Too much smoke and I can smell something even from my long jhons after returning home.

I will never visit again."}
{"text":"This place is great for a little more razzle dazzle of KBBQ. I've heard about this place but never been until recently. I'm going to be focusing on 3 things; food itself, service, and dining atmosphere. 

The food here is sooooo great! It's not overly salted like other KBBQ places. I can eat many items without my throat and mouth feeling dehydrated and weird. They have a great selection of items, with your classics of sliced beef and pork, fish, squid, shrimp, etc. They're Korean short ribs were phenomenal! I think my favorite of all time. And especially being able to cook it to my liking which is extra crisp, it was perfect. They had more veggies than other KBBQ places which I like, to cut through the richness of the meats. I do wish they had a bigger dessert menu, because I mean, who doesn't save room for dessert. But that wasn't a big issue, I came here mostly for the meats and veggies. Overall, great flavor, great variety! I'd rate this 5/5

The service was good, the server seemed frantic and was running around a lot even though his section of the restaurant wasn't that busy. There were times when I needed assistance and it took me a couple tries to get his attention. He was a friendly and outgoing server who liked to talk to the people at my table which was nice. The only thing that I wasn't so happy with, and I know some restaurants do this - a service charge. I understand that servers may be frustrated that people do not tip, but I personally think it should not be forced upon a customer who is dining, to pay a service charge. Especially if service was not good. And I think, especially for a place like KBBQ where customers cook their OWN food, I just felt it wasn't right to automatically include a service charge in the bill. I'd rate this 3/5

The dining atmosphere was great, a very modern but classy look. The marble (I think?) steps and the black on the curtains and walls made the restaurant look that much more sophisticated. It wasn't too noisy and the tables were all spaced out nicely. I do wish the tables were a bit bigger, especially going with a big group when you order lots of items and the grill already takes up a lot of space. I'd rate this 4.5/5

Overall, I think this is a great place for KBBQ, great variety of items to grill and with wonderful, bursting flavors. Meats were tender and veggies tasted fresh. Wasn't overly salted, I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying the bbq here is pretty awesome. What I had issues here with is how the bill was handled. They charge an auto 10 percent tip for all party sizes, which is fine, but the menu didn't make mention of this. What's worse is that my server hid the bill from me and just gave me the credit card machine in hopes of me not realizing there is a pre tip and so that I tip a full amount on top. 

Only after submitting an additional 15 percent tip on top of the 10, did I realize something was not adding up. I asked the server to see the bill (he was still holding it far from my view) and automatically he started playing defence telling me some untruthful story how the pre tip is only for the bus boys and not the servers. It was a long day and so I left it as is.. But I'll have second thoughts about coming back given this experience."}
{"text":"All you can eat!

It's not real Korean food so don't expect it to taste Korean. It's Chinese done on a Korean BBQ grill is how I would describe it. Maybe I should ship some Korean BBQ sauce to Toronto and sell it!

Because I actually love authentic Korean food, I was not impressed. This is more like fusion to attend to the Chinese clientele. If I don't regularly eat Korean food, I would love this place. Because I wasn't expecting this kind of \"taste,\" it just threw me off.

The weirdest was not even the food itself. When we received our tab, the server told us that there was 10% gratuity charged to the bill; but actually he only keeps 2% and the house takes 8%. We were scratching our heads. So we're tourists and you're telling me your boss is screwing you over or you just want extra tips? If you actually want more tips, why didn't you provide more service? I come from 20% tip land so it wouldn't be twisting my arm if you actually took really good care of our table."}
{"text":"Went for a Sunday dinner with my family and we were sorely disappointed with the service and the cleanliness at this place.  When we arrived, the host could not give me an estimate for wait times as we didn't have a reservation. We were however, promptly seated at a dirty table which we had to request be cleaned. The service proceeded to be bad, forgotten orders, and a bad attitude from the wait staff. They didn't have metal cutlery and provided us with plastic ones, condiments came haphazardly thrown in tiny plastic bowls, and the dessert which tasted worse than airplane food came in little Styrofoam cups. Then, when we got the bill, there was a 10% gratuity slapped on there; of which the wait staff said they only receive 1%. It is apparent that this place is not managed well, and the staff are poorly treated which is why we had such lackluster service. The place was loud and poorly designed, we sat in the most uncomfortable wooden seats, and there was poor ventilation. We were also not provided any scissors or knives to cut large pieces of meat. Needless to say, we will not be going back."}
{"text":"When there with co-workers to celebrate a successful finish to a big project. Was my second time at a Korean BBQ. Chako was a lot of fun! They serve a lot of food and its super fun to grill your own stuff on the hot plates. I enjoyed this a lot, but don't dress to fancy, because the smoke from the cooking can stay with you after you eat, but that will not stop me from going back. Everything was very tasty and interactive!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time. Mediocre at best. Meats were not seasoned well whatsoever with the exception of the ribs.  The thin slices of beef had absolutely no flavour/seasoning contrary to the numerous reviews of it being perfectly seasoned. Thought maybe it was a batch.  We ordered more with the same result. 

The kimchi and radishes were the best sides that they offered. Skip the bean sprouts and tofu! 

The rolls were good. The sushi was blah! Warm salmon on top of rice. Such a disappointment. 

Despite all of this, the service was top notch. Our server was great. Very attentive and made sure we were taken care of. He listened to all of our requests and followed up with them. Great work there! 

It's honestly over priced for what it is. It is however a unique experience!!"}
{"text":"my favorite Korean BBQ restaurant. I have yet to find a better spot for the price and service. The servers are really friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Worst service ever in toronto! 
i have frds came from UK and wanted to eat korean bbq so we brought them to there.
Food is okay.
However the service definitely ruined out dinner.
Almost every server including manager looked like having a bad mood and didnt willing to serve people. All of them seemed to have a bad attitude. 
I heard complains from the table besides us too.

Will never ever go back again. This was my worst restaurant experience in toronto!!!!"}
{"text":"I love Korean bbq! This place is pretty good and a fun different way to enjoy a meal with family or friends. Some of the meat cuts are better than others but for ayce I can't complain!"}
{"text":"Food will arrive .. But your rice will definitely remain cold. Servers are not friendly, only to a full table of guests.If it's a 2 people table they'll forget about you!!
 I Don't recommend.I find Spoonful way better."}
{"text":"The food her actually had good flavour, but the service was really lacking. I liked that they had vegetables on the menu, and the kalbi ribs were my favourite.

We ordered things, but didn't get them. The staff didn't seem to know what they were doing. They seemed very unorganized and inefficient. We had to enquire about our sushi order to see where it was, and they kept trying to bring us a second order. This eventually landed up on other people's tables. Then the rice took forever to come. We were waiting a long time to get our orders and the 1st hour no one really came to look after us. We were always waving someone down. They have 1.5 hr limit on dining, but we were there probably there an extra 30 min because of all the waiting. We left before we even got our complete dessert order.

I wouldn't come back here in a hurry."}
{"text":"Not sure of the bad reviews. Service has been both good and slow but it is expected if you come in on a holiday or wknd. I quite like the kbbq and don't think its poor quality at all. Yes, I've gone to Richmonhill/Markham for kbbq a lot of times before, and yes I think they come quite close. Quite frankly, Id rather not waste time and gas anyways. The plus side is that I can get my meat, beer, sushi, AND hit up the theatres after, why not? To each their own huh?"}
{"text":"Top notch service overcomes any issues.  There are a number of Korean BBQ all you can eat places in Toronto, so the competition is obviously pretty stiff.

Welcome to Chako, a modernly decorated restaurant where you cook your own food on a built-in burner.  To accommodate larger parties, Chako has 2 burners per table, but that makes it difficult for your server to reach under to adjust the inner most burner.

Once you get those logistics out of the way, the variety of meats, seafood, sushi, grilled pineapples were all fresh and tasty.  Our server was very attentive.

Chako takes reservations - highly recommended as this place was hopping!"}
{"text":"The servers are very nice, and attentive. But the food is not worth the price. The beef tongue, the beef, the pork,  the strawberry ice cream, and the mango pudding are probably the best things on the menu. I found that the marinade used for the chicken was lacking in flavor, and the sushi was abysmal. Probably the worst sushi I've ever had in my life. We ordered spicy salmon rolls, you could hardly taste the salmon and the panko surrounding the salmon was mushy rather than crunchy it was super unpleasant to eat. You can eat better sushi at Ocean's which is saying a lot. The last thing that was the icing on the cake was the fact that there is tip included in the bill, but according to the server that money does not go towards them. The servers are nice so I felt bad and put an additional tip on top, which basically turned into a 20 dollar tip in total. It wasn't a horrible experience but the quality of food did not reflect the price, which is what bothered me the most."}
{"text":"Yesterday I went with a group of 11 friends and one of them had reservations for dinner at 10:15 but the late night special was at 10:30 (Which he didn't know). 

We were told that we couldn't wait 15 minutes more at the table for the late night special by the manager, she told us we either had to take the dinner which costed us all $33 when we could've just paid $23 and that we had to line up all the way at the back. Last time I went with my friends to Chacko after 10:30 we did not get a table until 11 so I didn't want to wait even longer. I was thinking who will honestly pay $8 more for a table within the 15 minutes we could've waited? The waiter seemed willing to let us wait but once the manager came it was a different story.

Think of it like this, you're paying $8 more which doesn't include taxes or gratuity and only getting 3-4 items more which no one likes when you could've been told you can wait at your table until 10:30 for a cheaper price and have the same items you eat. 

I barely go to Chako and its a good thing that I don't too because there are far better kbbq places to go to rather than here."}
{"text":"Was here for a party, in a group of 8. There aren't only meat choices, but you can also order sushi. There aren't many choices but it adds a lot more to the experience. You get to cook the meat yourselves, while they change the stove top every once in a while. The dish I recommend is their pork belly. It's one of the only places where they have the pork belly in a type of sauce. Only downside is the extreme scent of smoke, and it will carry on you for quite a long time. I recommend coming here at night, so you don't need to carry a scent of smoke everywhere you go."}
{"text":"I love kbbq! This place is pretty good, I prefer the lunch service (price is on poinnntt).. I've gone for dinner, and it was over 70 dollars for two adults and two kids under 5.. It was good, but not worth 70 dollars good haha! That's why it's not a 4* review.
The service was fine for us each time we've gone! The servers were a bit quiet, but, that's not exactly a bad thing!

The sushi at dinner service was pretty good, the miso soup was good, kimchi was tasty, the calamari wasn't very appetizing.. But the chicken, pork, beef, and ribs were delicious!! They all have the same marinade, which I guess can get a bit monotonous, the veggies don't have any marinade, so I put some soy sauce on them before cooking to give then some flavour. 

Dessert was just ice cream, that wasn't anything special, but I'll be back for lunch!!"}
{"text":"Dined here on two occasions and quite a standard AYCE Korean BBQ and sushi offering.  Prompt service in fulfilling our requests, removing empty dishes and changing our grills.  Could really use more variety for their desserts...and larger size!  The green tea and mango pudding orders came out in tiny mini cups the size of a sauce container...we had to order 3x as much on the second round!  Not a really efficient use of packaging.  Overall, a nice place for a gathering with family or friends."}
{"text":"I read the reviews here before going. Someone mentioned that the tips were already included on the bill. In hindsight, that should've been a giant red flag, but I already told everyone where we were going so made the reservation anyways. 

SERVICE:
Arrived and got our seats. I spent a good few minutes keeping my arm up to get someone to get my order. THREE waiters looked a me and ignored me, no head nod, no hand gesture of 'one moment'. 
We ordered rolls and sushi in addition to kbbq meat. Like a normal person, we to eat food at our own pace. Unfortunately, a waiter kept nagging/reminding us to finish the sushi or else we'd be charged. Another waiter (looks to be a manager) has a really bad attitude. She rolled her eyes when giving us food, used a cocky tone when answering our questions, and didnt bring our order a few times.

FOOD/DRINKS:
Drinks are not included. It's an extra $2.50 with free refill, but since it's watered down anyways, sticking with cold water would be the same.
The food is the same as most of the other kbbq place (depends on your cooking skills). However the chicken were cut wayyy too thick, impossible to cook the middle properly without burning the outside.

DECOR:
Looks nice. Although it's a bit too dim. Needed it to be a bit brighter so I can check if the food is properly cooked or not.
Washroom's are the individual stall type (like at home).

PRICE/VALUE:
Price for the food is acceptable. Especially if you can go late for the $10 late owl. The drinks are watery so the $2.50 isnt worth it. 
Tips were included which caused the pathetic service that we experienced.

Basically, the service of most of the waiters were crap. Worse, the manager's attitude was horrendous. I would prefer the Richmond Hill location over the Scarborough one since the food and decor are the same, but with better service."}
{"text":"I came here with my brother and cousin for an impromptu dinner. The food was pretty good. I really enjoyed the ox tongue. Service was very very friendly. I've never had somebody ask to refill my water/pop so often! A decent spot, but a bit pricey considering the amount of options and if you're not a literal eating machine."}
{"text":"I haven't had KBBQ (and Chakos in particular) in a long while so I'm not sure if it's just my decreased affinity for meat or the actual place, but I feel like the food got worse. The short ribs were way too fatty and the \"maki rolls\" were almost embarrassing. I mean, I can't say I didn't expect the sushi to be crappy because it's a kbbq restaurant after all, but a little part of me still feels like I got ripped off because they dangled that glimpse of hope by offering sushi on their menu. Other than spicy salmon, which is a gimmick in itself for crappy end pieces of salmon mixed with leftover tempura batter, all of the offerings were vegetarian. The rolls were rice-heavy and poorly rolled and so they kept falling apart.

However, I liked the daikon side dish, the chicken, and the variety of vegetables to choose from. The zucchini and bell peppers definitely helped to make the meal \"remotely healthier\" and allowed me to take breaks between my meat indulgences. 

Careful to note that they already include 10% tip in the bill and everything else you give is extra tip. The service was quick and attentive though, so the extra tips are well-deserved."}
{"text":"Not the best all 'you can eat' Korean BBQ out there, but decent.
For a better deal dine in after 10p.m on weekdays for cheap."}
{"text":"The restaurant is spacious and well decorated. We had the ayce dinner and menu had good selection of meats. We esp liked the meat which was well marinated and was soft when cooked. The sushi was decent, sadly you must order sushis before 9pm though. Even on a Thursday night, it was pretty busy which meant it is quite a popular choice for people. Paired with some specialty saki, the food was lovely. It has a nice ambience and is a perfect setting for get together with friends or family to have a nice experience of cooking and eating together. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"the photo shows the business hours is incorrect! They close at 12 am now and the price for after 10pm is $13.99 now."}
{"text":"If you like bbq this place is is pretty dang good! It has quite a few things to choose from on the menu to bbq my fav are the ribs and thin slices of beef with some zucchini and peppers. The restaurant has very nice atmosphere it feels very open because of the high ceiling they also have big tables for party's. now I'm giving this place three stars because of two thin one of them is when you order a pop everyone has to get one so I would just stick to water. The second thing is the they charge you 10% for gratuity but the waitress or waiters don't see any of that money which to me is like they are just adding there own tax and making maximum profits off the customers. Now this to me is very wrong also doesn't sound legal."}
{"text":"All you can eat Meat. ALL YOU CAN EAT MEAT... and All You Can meat... did I say this place has all you can eat Meat... and oh ya... all you can eat Sushi too...

But really you come here for the All you can eat Meat because the Sushi is subpar at best. I would describe it as kind of like going to a Chinese Restaurant and ordering a Burger so you can have it but...you already know it wont be good. Haha!

This locations service is Much Much better than the location in Mississauga and the servers here are quick, attentive, and they bring out the food and drinks right after you order! I mean really how hard can it be to bring out Raw meat for you to cook yourself right?

They have plenty of Protein options such as Beef, Lamb, Chicken, Pork, Shrimp, Squid, Mussels, and tons of other items as well. O yea... they have veggies such as Zucchini, Bell Peppers, and Pineapples which are so yummy on the grill!

I come here every single time to feed my Bodybuilder Style Arms and Legs after an intense workout or helping my friends move into another one of their 5 houses.  Come here if you need to bulk up and make sure you ear your $30 worth and make those servers work! Work! Work!"}
{"text":"Chako is my favourite AYCE Korean grill restaurant. It has an extensive menu with sushi and meats/seafood for the grill, service is fast at giving new items, and the atmosphere is buzzing. It is located in a strip mall in Scarborough, and can get very busy."}
{"text":"The service and ambiance of this Korean BBQ are above average. The real miss in this place is the quality of the food and the cleanliness of the bathrooms. 

The experience of barbecuing meats and fish right at the table is fun and unique, but that isn't enough to encourage repeat visits. 

How this place works is that you order as much raw meat, seafood, veggies and sushi as you want, then you cook it yourself. Sounds great, but the menu is extremely limited. 

The quality of the meat here is extremely low. The ribs are horribly fatty and plump, and the beef is a paper thin shaving of various cuts. No two orders had the same consistency. 

The shrimp were adequate but fishy, and the vegetables were very sad. An order of zucchini got you four dried out slices. Not even oil on them. 

The other meats were all marinated in a bland bbq liquid. 

The cocktail I ordered, as it was cocktail night, completely missed the mark. My Cosmo (the entire bar menu was a 90s wet dream, tequila sunrise and Sours) was not at all correct. I am convinced it was a screwdriver, orange juice and vodka in a martini tumbler. 

Not impressed. You're better off going to the butcher and grilling at home. Plus at least your clothes won't smell. 

Not interested in returning, but probably will with groups as its a non-offensive, comprise sort of place."}
{"text":"After going to the Markham location, we were a but hesitant to come here but we were pleasantly surprised. We came relatively early before the rush so perhaps that explains the quick service. The survive was very quick and efficient, contrary to other reviews, and the food was delicious. We left very stuffed. The weekend dinner has a lot more options for only a few more dollars, and in my opinion provides the best value. We left very satisfied and stuffed."}
{"text":"Great service - especially by our server Jason.

The food was above what I expected it to be; although this was my first KBBQ experience. At first I thought it'd be plain meat, marinated only slightly, and the fun would be you grilling it yourself. 
But wow, the meat was marinated with amazing taste - especially the chicken. Love their crunchy yam rolls too (although you can't really go wrong with it, but their yam rolls are better than going out to AYCE sushi restaurants. That says a lot).

They can change your grill when it gets overused and burnt, but you will have to ask them to d do it. Although, it would be nice if they would notice it and take the initiative to make that change, but it's important to know that they are extremely busy so they probably won't make that offer themselves.

I'll definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"So now I've finally gone on a weekend and I must say that I like there salmon sushi and all of the other stuff included in to the menu. Just remember to bring your apatite and make the most of your 2hr time slot cause its $20."}
{"text":"The best part about this place was that it's open so late. The food was subpar and they only had a total of probably 13 or 14 items. I didn't know it was somewhere where you grill your own food, but that's on me. It definitely took us by surprise though. Not really worth 20$ a person, though. Staffing was busy, but that's to be expected for a Friday night. Maybe I'll try it again next time I visit Toronto to see if experience makes it better. And come before 10 if you want sushi!!!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible waiting time. Was told by the hostess that the waiting time will be close to an hour which was fine with us. Not only did we wait for an extra thirty minutes but also they called out a party of the same size (that came an hour after us) before us! How was that fair?! We asked the hostess and all she said was \"I know, we're sorry\" and that was it. No explanation what so ever. This was unacceptable. 

Food and service was overall very good. Our server was very friendly and attentive with our order. Food came out quickly and taste was good for its price. 

Overall I will not go back."}
{"text":"I would give it 4.5 stars if I could.

Lunch and Late Night are the best deals, go if you can.

The quality is average to above average for an AYCE KBBQ place, but the short ribs are amazing.

Service is pretty good as well."}
{"text":"If you ever have those KBBQ cravings then Chako is your place to go. Since KBBQ isn't the healthiest thing you can eat specifically during late night you want to make each trip count since it won't be a while till you find yourself in front of the hot grill grilling those juicy marinated meat.  I guarantee you after pigging yourself out you'll be so revolted you don't want to ever eat this grease buffet again. Yet I swore to myself multiple times that this would be my last! Nevertheless another month has gone by and my longing for KBBQ has return.

There are actually three locations for Chako in the GTA; Scarborough, Markham and Mississauga. I however only been to the Scarborough and Markham locations, hence this review will reflect on these two places. 

Let's get on with the good stuff.

If you ever do go during dinner time you can experience the full chako experience along with their Izakaya menu's (Japanese - Sushi etc...) the price would put you alongside other AYCE diners.  The sushi itself is not bad, a lot of rice though. 

TIP: If you want to eat rice, don't order a rice on the side just order sushi eat the fish sashimi style and use the vinegar flavor rice as your base for the meat: P

Beef: the beef is amazing here, the marinate in my opinion is much better than Korean grill house. Personally this is the dish you most refilling the most.  9/10 -1 for inconsistency 

Chako Select Beef: This one is overrated, its just a mediocre steak with their own unique spice, try it if you must but you'll find yourself favoring the regular beef 8/10 

Beef Ribs: Decent, if you are a rib lover you can dine on this all night.  8.5/10

Pork: Basically Bacon, I'm not big on pork myself. Better than Korean Grill House 7/10 

Chicken: Better than most KBBQ places marinade is well suited for BBQ 8.5/10
Fish Fillet: Basically Basa Fillets, big portions well marinated (natural flavor) 8.5/10

Squid: Squid Lover so might be a bit biased, again its only squid you either like it or not. 9.5/10

Ice cream: If you want the best mango ice cream Chako has it. They also have green tea however I'm not big on green tea. 

Appetizers: miso soup 8.5/10 very well flavored.  Salad 8.5/10 usually I'd avoid the cheap stuff at buffets but the salad is interestingly enough to try out. 

Over all the Scarborough location is a bit hectic thus the food is more fresh compared to the one at east beaver creek in Markham. The consistency at the Scarborough store is considerably superior, down side is despite advertising a smoke free atmosphere the Scarborough air circulation system is not as good as the one in Markham. Overall 9/10, remember moderation, self-control, is key to getting the most out of each visit."}
{"text":"It was okay. I mean for $33+$4 tax for two ppl for lunch on a Sunday. Not too bad. There was no sushi for lunch though. The drive was 30 mins for me. So I wouldn't ness. go back. Wasn't outstanding. The servers were kinda rude. And if u have back problems ( like me ) it's not a comfy place. Booths are wood and the stools are so tiny you can't even fit ur a** on it ahah. Idk it's okaywouldnt go back but didn't regret. The atmosphere was nice and at first he lit our BBQ and than it wasn't even on for first 15 mins :|. So that was kinda annoying but I mean BBQ your self is fun... also whatever you don't eat is $3. ....2.7 for me/5"}
{"text":"All you can eat Korean BBQ.  If you can hold out until after 10PM, $10 on weeknights.  

We had:
Short Ribs - Very very tasty!
Beef - Meh, wasn't very flavourful
Calamari - I don't know what they marinate it in, but it is just bursting with flavour
Kimchee - I'm in love!
Fish - I'm guessing its a bassa fillet or tilapia fillets, these were very tasty, but they do take longer to cook through.  
Steamed Rice - I use this as a grease/oil soaker.  Spread my rice all over the plate, and then it soaks up all the grease.  However, if you could still stomach it, the rice is VERY savoury afterwards, lol

Green tea ice cream is pretty good.  You can ask them to change the grill for you once there is too much black char stuck to it.  They are quite busy, and service can be slow, but they are good at refilling your water (which is much needed after ingesting all the MSG).

The washrooms are interesting.  You walk in and there are individual washrooms lining the walls.  The space is quite large, with high ceilings and its very spacious.  A great place to go with a group of friends!"}
{"text":"Prices 2018 Jan 9


Mon to Thurs 

Adult dinner: $24.99

Child 5-10: $ 17.99

Child 4: $3


Fridays and weekends is $2 more. 


Okay I've been to many Chakos around Toronto and always had a good meal there. Gone at least 7 times. 


It was my first time to this Mississauga location.  


Restaurant looked big and very nice. Clean, not smokey and had some neat purple tree lighted up inside the restaurant. 


Service was fine no complaints, they changed the grill when I asked them, no issues. Food came fast. 


Food quality: here's a big issue, the beef ribs were extremely tough. And no, it wasn't because I cooked it for too long. From the two portions (10 pieces) no matter how long I cooked then for, it was like chewing through leather.  I couldn't even bite through one!  I had to spit out every piece.  Beef ribs are one of my favorite cuts.  So I do know how to grill them.  Heck, it ain't rocket science 


Pineapples: can't gone wrong here right?  Wrong!  I was expecting the usual Chako sweet, juicy grilled pineapple, but it was dry and tough!!  I tried one before it was grilled to make sure and yup, dry, and not juicy.  Sad. As pineapple was one distinguishing factor for Chako vs other Korean AYCE grills


Shrimp: maybe it was just my grilling technique, but after grilling them, it was very tough to peel the shell off. Imo that's a sign of non freshness of shrimp 

Kim Chi: oh yes this perhaps was the most delicious item. But first you need to grill it on the grill and it tastes extremely delicious!


Everything else (sliced beef, chicken, fish, etc) was okay.  Not bad not spectacular either.  The California roll and spicy Salmon roll was just mediocre. 


Smoke: here's the Biggest issue. There seems to be no suction exhaust fan at all??  Back like 10 years ago, Toronto Korean BBQ started using suction directly at the grill level.  So from that point forward, your clothes didn't stink like Korean BBQ for 2 days after. 


So this Chako had no suction so the smoke just rose like it would and blow into our faces and eyes. It was very uncomfortable.  Soon, the entire restaurant was smokey as expected. And it was only like 10% full?   See attached photo of the smoke.


This made our dinner very un-enjoyable and I couldn't wait to get out of there. 


Chako Mississauga please install those exhaust fan at the grill level!!!  


Tips: like someone posted, the waiter told us the first 10% goes to manager and then whatever is on top is service.   This is bullocks. I thought about it and I believe this is something the waiters say to make more tips. 


Either management knows they are saying this or not. I bet you the servers gets the tip like any other restaurant, but this way many people will pay more!  


If what they say is true, then the restaurant simply raised the prices by 10%. And if I was a waiter there, I'd complain why I am not getting the tip as normal. And I'd look for another restaurant to work at if that's the case. 


So, bad ribs, smoke in my eyes, tip issue, non enjoyable dinner:


1 star 



Other Chako locations, 4 stars."}
{"text":"We came here with a group of 9 and they seated us within 5 minutes. It was surprisingly busy on a Sunday night.

FOOD: mediocore, in comparison to the scarborough location. The meat was fattier especially the short ribs, the appetizers such as the kimchi and fried tofu didn't appear to be that fresh. Sushi was alright the fish was a very thin slice over a huge chunk of rice. The other location also appeared to have more options and I was surprised they didn't even serve green tea ice cream! I mean c'mon its an asian restaurant...

SERVICE: super slow, our server wasn't very attentive and also had to be reminded to bring our water and extra cups for the sake we ordered several times. 

AMBIENCE: here is where the extra star goes to, this location appeared to be more nicely decorated and was dimly light. Lots of seating area but also shared with Wasabi which was on the other side. 

This place is not worth the bbq smell all over your clothing."}
{"text":"Okay I only come for late night or lunch cuz it's inexpensive. It's $11.99 during those times. There isn't a huuuuge selection, but enough. Could be more, just saying :P."}
{"text":"Good service. At night u can get sushi with bbq. But the meat wasn't flavoured right. And the meat took very long to cook for 26 dollars per person. There's better kbbq places"}
{"text":"Been here a number of times for all you can eat dinner:

-Fast service 
-Food is marinated and seasoned generously; lots of flavour
-Plenty of side dishes to choose from that are also seasoned well
-Good variety of meat and seafood
-Not as much variety for desserts, but it was average in terms of taste 
-Their sushi is close to average; a bit too much rice wine vinegar which made the rice taste more tart than usual
-Some things are authentic Korean dishes and some are a little more non-traditional, which makes this spot unique 
-Loud atmosphere, especially at dinner; it's a popular spot - good for groups
-Nice and comfortable decor and lighting 
Overall my favourite menu items: beef short ribs, pork, kimchi, raddish and the beef slices. 

Things to improve on: Although fast, service is still a hit or miss: We had a case where the staff was rushing us within the last 10 minutes of the 2 hours we had to eat. 
One of us paid $5 in quarters, since that was all they had at the time and they were not willing to count that, so another person had to give a $5 bill instead. 

Average dinner pricing for adults: $20-$25"}
{"text":"My children have always wanted to try kbbq but I have always resisted because I like to eat out and not cook.  But I gave in and we ended up coming here for dinner.  
We were greeted promptly at the desk and seated pretty quickly.  The service was really good from everyone we encountered bar one older bespectacled male server, he was miserable.  But we were near the end of our enjoyable dinner, so we were in high spirits.  If he'd served us from the beginning, our experience would've been different.  

You basically order meats, seafood and vegetables to grill on the sunken gas grill set in your table.  There's also lots of side dishes and sushi to choose from too.  The best meats for me were the chicken(dark meat) and the ox tongue.  But there wasn't anything wrong with the other meats, the only meat we didn't order was pork.  The sushi rolls were fine.  The pickles, kimchi, cucumber, salad, soba noodles and cold tofu starters were all good.  And everyone had a small cup of ice cream at the end.  The servers changed our grill top during our dinner and kept adding water to the grill.  

My kids had a fun time cooking their own dinner and I found it wasn't such a chore.  We all had a fun dinner and will definitely return.  The only downside is the smell that now lingers on our clothes and hair."}
{"text":"it's okay...the meat is not all that tasty.  The sushi is below average.  The service is friendly.  The atmosphere is pretty good for northern scarberia.  You can find the same thing for less money nearby (admittedly, you'd get a ton less atmosphere though)"}
{"text":"Very unimpressive kbbq here. I didn't come here with high expectations, but Chako seriously disappointed. The meat is very meh. Everything was just meh. It was a pretty forgettable meal. The main problem I have is that I've had better kbbq for cheaper.
Also, don't order the sushi here, it was pretty sloppily made and didn't taste that great.
Overall a very lackluster experience."}
{"text":"Been here for Dinner on a Thursday $23.99 AYCE.
Only place that serves AYCE Korean BBQ & Sushi (limited selection) but it was still really good!
Service was amazing. Someone is always there to fill up your water and take away empty dishes when needed.
Food was okay. I really enjoyed their chicken."}
{"text":"I was brought here by a friend.. The food was good. They had different type of meat for you to barbecue. But the service was the problem. Unfortunately, our lady server was rude. She dropped the meat tray hard in front of us several times and gave us attitude. We were so confused as to how we annoyed her... anyways I decided to tip her less, based on the uncalled for attitude. Then I was so shocked to see the 10% gratuity fee already included in our bill. No wonder she provided us bad service, as she was already guaranteed the tip (I am actually not sure whether this portion would be given to her but was her nasty!)

Again, there is nothing wrong with the food. I choose to not come again due to their ridiculous billing on top of poor service. If you happen to get a good server, or you can ignore the attitude from this lady, it can still be a good place to eat."}
{"text":"Seated right away. Great service from Brian. Nice clean grill. Tasty meat. Tried the steak, lamb, ribs and shrimp. Ribs are the hands down favourite!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is like my second home , the food is awsom and the service is fast on a Monday afternoon . I can say that I eat here 4 times a month because of the pork,lamb, shrimp and veggies . I really enjoy the chillie oil and rice / soup . But only thing I have to wear clothes that you don't want to get stunk. The smell of the BBQ sticks on ur cloths so dress in comfort clothing all in all I really really like BBQ I am hungry just thinking about this place !!"}
{"text":"So this was originally Wasabi now its both Wasabi and Chako (Korean BBQ grill).even though after 10 pm the price is $12.99, its limited. I still recommend the full BBQ since you get the option of ordering sushi ($19.99). Buffet on weekends and holidays is $22.99 that's the one I actually recommend. You get a lot more such has mutton (very good), specialty chako beef, steak, more sushi options. 
My main concern for them is that the grill isn't hot and the meat instead of grilling sort of boils which then takes longer to cook. Sushi is mediocre. Falls apart, rice lacked the acidity. Service however is better than food. Our server recommended what to eat and was honest in what not to eat. Usually they go by \"its all good\". I would recommend this place once and then the second time is your own will."}
{"text":"I am a frequent customer of Chako and have been for many years.  Bothe the Mississauga location along with the Richmond Hill location.  People complain about the quality of the meat but really come on guys what do you expect for the price you are paying and really its ALL YOU CAN EAT.  For the price you pay the food is GREAT and the fact that you cook it yourself is truly a different experience and makes dining fun.  Also saves people complaining how their meat is cooked.  

Now lets talk about the service.  I have been and the service was incredible and other times ive had to get up from the table and find a server.  Its not consistant. 

All and all i give 4 stars.  Would have given 5 stars but the services issues bother me sometimes.

I suggest everyone tries this place but consider this a heads up about the service depending on the day."}
{"text":"This was my first Korean Bbq. Food was great. We had some sushi as well before the meat came out. My favourite meat was the sliced beef...They really marinate all their meats so well, even after cooking it you can taste the flavours well."}
{"text":"Our waiter remembered every item we ordered from the buffet menu without taking any notes. Not one thing was forgotten. Our food was ready within a couple of minutes and the service was phenomenal. Food was delish! A great experience overall."}
{"text":"A frequent favourite and best Korean BBQ in Scarborough. The staff are usually quite attentive and there are lots of servers around to always help. All you can eat meat and the Mango Ice Cream is the best. I seriously have come just for the ice cream lol. Lots of sides and sushi to choose from. Definitely recommend to all in the area."}
{"text":"It is all you can eat yet everything seems WAY TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO salty for any human beings to eat or digest. Doubt it will benefit our body if you are a healthy eater; if you are not or just looking for some average all you can eat bbq places, for sure you can give it a try~"}
{"text":"The food was okay, not brilliant, just a regular Korean BBQ not much different than others. But more expensive."}
{"text":"Yummm! Here you need patience! And its best if you haven't eaten much all day long. That's what we do when we know we are going there in the night. We just eat little snacks to survive the day. The marinated meat is amazing. The staff are sweet and I'm pretty sure I see the owner Lady (short straight hair ) she is the sweetest.  We love coming to this location because the atmosphere is just the perfect balance of craziness and calmness at the same time. Oh and how can I forget the spicy salmon sushi! Pretty much all sushi available here is just mind blowing! You can always taste the freshness! 
I'm always ready to go here!

P.s. The ideal place to wear loose clothing so you can walk out with a pertruding belly. Oh and always come out smelling like the delicious meat! 
Not an ideal first date place... gets pretty loud sometimes! I'd say great for like the 3rd... 

Cheers!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, I went late night on a Wednesday. Not much variety but how far can you get with Korean bbq? Price was decent 13-14$$ for all you can eat

SHORT RIBS = AMAZING; def order this!!! soooo good best on the menu. 

Servers weren't on their A-game, I asked for 2 things at diff times and they forgot both items, saracha sauce and the bill... I asked again and they still didn't bring it.. they're forgetful BUT they always made sure my glass was filled with water, they were def A+ on that bit!

Ambiance was soooo chill, ambiance was extremely inviting, place doesn't \"LOOK\" too crowded because of the design, Loved the ambiance of the place, you and your bf or friends, but work with this place's interior decorating!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This month was the second time I went to Chako in the span of a year and both times I was highly impressed. Firstly, I'd just like to say if a place is known for its Korean BBQ then don't expect the sushi to be above sub-par. I haven't tried it here but this is Korean BBQ so I come for the Korean BBQ. I came with a large group of about 20 or so and of course we had a reservation. The staff was friendly, always stayed on point and never forgot about us or made us feel like we weren't wanted(especially seeing as we ate ALOT of food. We came for late night and they allowed us to pay while continuing to order mango ice cream(which is AWESOME).The meat was delicious, well-seasoned and flavoured this is the ONLY Korean BBQ place I have come across that has seasoned their meat well.Their short-ribs we delicious! And seeing as I don't really see the point in paying to cook bland food, this is the only place I will go to for Korean BBQ. I also tried their fish which were thick slabs (Of what I'm not sure) and took a while to took but was always soft and supple to eat. The chicken had a nice light curried seasoning which was not overpowering at all. Definitely will go again to sink my teeth in some good grilled meat."}
{"text":"The place is really nice inside. Some really cool decor and a good overall ambiance. I came there with two other people for all you can eat chako. We were sat promptly even though we came there on a Saturday night, about 730 without a reservation. The servers were quick to take our order and everything was brought in less than 5 minutes. The selection is the best I've seen in a Korean BBQ place with a wide variety of meat (marinated perfectly and melts in your mouth when cooked) and other condiments such as rice, soup, salad and veggies. All the food was fresh and generously cut/portioned. Everything was great right down to the ice cream! Creamy and practically fluffy - awesome quality and made in Canada! We were checked on frequently and our glasses were never empty considering the entire place was packed. Very impressed with this place. Great experience and already planning the next time I come in!"}
{"text":"The ox tongue, lamb and beef ribs are great. Our server George was hilarious and made us have a great time!"}
{"text":"I don't know why such poor ratings? I would honestly give it a solid four.

So basically this place is a Korean self cook all you can eat restaurant.So I went for a weekend lunch all you can eat and I was pleasantly surprised that I came out from this restaurant to a happy customer.

So basically on a table of 8, we had 3 grills in front and there is unlimited meats and Vegetables to cook with. So for meats the options on the weekend lunch were chicken, calamari, fish, pork, beef ribs, sliced beef. The veggies included bell peppers and zucchini. You also get to eat unlimited rice and for dessert there is ice cream.

Since it was my first time here my favorites were the thinly sliced beef and the beef ribs. The quality of meat for the price was good I had no complaints and I thoroughly enjoyed my meat. Before coming here I had read a few reviews which mentioned that the meats used were  not of good quality but I am glad I had two differ here.All the meats were of good quality and perfectly seasoned.

The service rendered to us by Wilson was absolutely outstanding, he made sure our table was always filled with the meats  of a choice and that are grills were changed once they had too much food building up on them.

The ambience of the restaurant is decent and the bathrooms neat and clean. There's plenty of parking outside the restaurant.I would definitely like to go there again when I'm craving lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of meat. Ha ha Ha ha ha!"}
{"text":"My family and I go here all the time be it for their special late night menu or for the regular priced menu buffet.

We are lucky to always get this girl, I don't want to mention her name but she is fast, accurate and IF, which is rare IF she ever forgot anything she usually apologizes and gets it right away.

It usually makes it easier when you tell them to OMIT something you arnt going to cook and eat. Even after your done eating and you say something like oh we didnt touch it (WHY would you think it would be ok for them to return it and use it again for someone else who comes and wants to cook and eat it, Would you want that served to you? NO...so know what you want and dont want) PLUS ordering in one go will make it easier for you and them. Telling them right away what you want instead of you making them stand there and wait while there are other people ready to order and you wasting their time.

TIP
if your a water drinker and you drink alot don't ask for just a glass, ask them for a pitcher if its not busy they'll leave one with you and refill the pitcher when they pass by if its empty.

When your done with something and you want there attention to order more move it towards the end of the table, they always keep an eye out for that stuff as soon as they come up order whatever your heart desires.

Hope that helps. 

Parking is huge
Washrooms are clean
Decor and ambiance is beautiful

NOTE for first time go'ers 
At the bottom they charge a service charge that is basically the tip. WHY they usually calculate with how many people there is at the table. IF you are a large group, tell them right away if you want separate bill or what...

I know everyone is entitled to their opinion but honestly don't expect much you were rude to begin with. This is me thinking why people are giving it such low reviews.


***The employee's here are HONEST after my sister's birthday my bf left his blackberry bold on the table. I called that night to ask if they saw it and our waitress had left it at the front desk. The next day I went to go pick it up because they were closed when I called. The lady said I have no problem giving you the phone but please call it so I know its yours. She was not only honest about having it but made sure it went back to the right owner. KUDOS to Chako and their staff!"}
{"text":"The meat were seasoned very well. However, its not authentic korean bbq, its just like a typical asian/chinese bbq."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner today (as I usually do when I'm very, very hungry) and it was awesome! I haven't been to many other Korean BBQ restaurants but I do feel like there is enough to choose from on the menu. I love the short ribs & sliced beef. For dessert the mango ice cream is delicious."}
{"text":"I went to Chako for my graduation lunch. It a an amazing all you can eat Korean BBQ. The short ribs were the best. Make sure you eat a lot of them.

Lunch wad really affordable. $15/person. Lunch has salad, short ribs, chicken, pork, beef, calamari, tilapia fish fillets, pineapple, zucchini, red pepper and ice cream. Dinner has a coupe more cuts of meat and sushi but is a little bit more expensive. 

The service was super fast and the food was amazing. We ate non-stop for 2 hours. The restaurant was quite big and could hold maybe 30-40 people. It was nice and modern. 

Overall, affordable and tasty. Highly recommend. Definitely can't find a place like this in where I am from, NYC."}
{"text":"I been here a few times I wish the meat was halal could of eaten it then. But tried the fish and other vegetables; everything was awesome didn't have any problems. The green tea ice cream was amazing , had so much. I will come back for more  great experience!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely one of the best KBBQ based restaurants in Mississauga. My friends and I were going to another KBBQ to eat, but it was overpriced (not naming to be nice lols). We decided to come from one side of Mississauga to get to this one, and it was worth the ride for sure. 

First things first, since most of my friends were getting Korean BBQ for the first time, we had no idea what to order. Right away when we said that, the waiter was like, \"why don't I just bring 2 of everything so you guys can see what you want to order? You are growing! Need to eat more!\". That guy was the nicest guy there, and we complimented him for the rest of the meal. There was also another waiter that wasn't ours, but he served our table sometimes and was a little bit more rude. But don't worry, just ask for a guy named Philip to serve your table! (I think)

Second, the food. Oh boy. We tried everything, even the side dishes, and there was not one thing that we didn't like. This restaurant isn't even run by legit Korean people, but it was better than most I've went to! They give you an incredibly generous amount of rice, each dish is like premium quality, and drinks were really good too for AYCE.

Lastly, the price. The first one we went to costed us $25 for dinner per person on a Friday, with absolutely no variety at all (only meat, no seafood). Here it's only $16, and  they have everything!"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for the night owl special which is basically a more limited menu after 10:30 to enjoy AYCE KBBQ for $19.99. It's usually your more common meats and seafood dishes that are included such as beef, pork, short ribs and chicken for the meats. Calamari and Fish for the seafood. A few veggie options as well.  It was super busy on the Friday night that we went around 10:30 with around up to 30 people waiting anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour. Thankfully, I made a reservation and was seated immediately after we arrived at the restaurant. After we ordered the food, it came out quickly and we were able to cook. Our servers were great. Got everything we wanted in a timely manner, super friendly and they kept refilling our water and getting napkins for us. It was super busy in the restaurant so the level of customer service was respectable. We sat for about 2 hours and didn't feel one bit rushed or felt that pressure from the servers especially when a restaurant is super busy. For desert, we got green tea and mango ice cream which was decent. Overall, a decent place to get your KBBQ fix. Good service, staff are super friendly and food is good. Always worth coming back!"}
{"text":"In one word, AMAZING. I've been coming here for years and I have never had a negative experience. The servers are very kind and friendly and are very attentive. 
Price-wise, its more expensive than most Korean BBQ restaurants but let me tell you, the quality you're paying for is worth it! The sliced beef itself is thinly cut rib eye steak!My favourite part is the all you can eat meat, rice and kimchi!! Oh good God the kimchi is to die for!! If I had to describe heaven I would say drive to Midland and Mcnicoll and look for the giant glowing red sign that says \"CHAKO\" 

I highly recommend the 10 o'clock late night special which I usually go to 4/5 times. Even though they take off some of the things from the dinner menu they keep the best meats (those bomb addicting short ribs I'm forever craving and thin slices of beef that I will never get tired of! You don't get the sushi during the lunch or late night special but it's average at best, believe me you're doing yourself a favour by skipping it. The late night and lunch special is a win win since you still get the best items on the menu and you don't break the bank! Make sure you try to make reservations because it's usually packed Friday-Sunday nights. 

If you've had a negative experience I urge you to give this place another try. Not only is the food mouthwatering and enticing, but it's also such a great place to go go with friends and family! Also a great place for a first date since you can cook for them and make them feel special like they have their own personal chef ;) (just don't undercook the chicken and you're safe) I just wish I could give this place a hundred stars!"}
{"text":"Wow. Just wow. Maybe because I had a really really really low expectation of this place so I was pleasantly suprised by their quality and service. I have previously been to the Richmondhill location and it was just horrible but this location is a different story. We came here the sunday on easter weekend at 5:00 pm. The pricing waa $27.99 for dinner which includes the meat, their special items, and sushi. Their sushi were on point that day. Rice was warm and soft and the salmon was fresh. Their meat was quite flavourful as well especially their ox tongue which was amazing. A little salty because of the sauce but it goes so well with their side dishes especially their kimchi, pickled radish, and pickled cucumber. Salty and sour is just the perfect combination. Other items (lamb, salmon, shrimp, mussels, beef rib) were ok and fresh. Their weekend only steak was not bad at all. It wasnt thin and had great marbling. Of course you gotta finish with their grilled pineapples. Service was fast and they come by to check on you alot. All in all, this location is so much better than the one in rhill. Remember to make reservations on weekends cuz it can be super packed."}
{"text":"Chako is an great KBBQ place in Scarborough; one of the best in my area.  However, compared to other k-grill places I've been too, it's just slightly above average.

The food is pretty good.  I LOVE the chicken.  Even though it takes a relatively long time to cook, it's definitely worth it.  You can't go wrong with the other meats and veggies either.  The atmosphere is pretty nice, but it does get loud.  

Chako is perfect if you're looking to stuff yourself for a pretty good price.  Coming for lunch or late at night is definitely recommended.  I've been to Chako about 5 times now and I've never been unsatisfied."}
{"text":"Food - my sushi was so filling. I had a veggie platter as I am a vegetarian, but even then, I was sooo full in the end. The meat my family had smelled divine. I was so tempted, won't even lie. It was just.

Ambiance - cute! I came for dinner and it was suitable.

Service - aww, the servers are absolutely adorable and they catered to every one of our needs! They checked on us so often and gave us what we needed and wanted. Probably some of the best service I've had from a non-5-star restaurant. I don't remember their names but when I see them, I will know."}
{"text":"Always a good any time of day. 
Menu is always the same. 
Staff is polite. Your clothes will smell like the food. 
Dont wear anything niceeeee."}
{"text":"The food is not the problem here. Everything tastes wonderful, marinated well and I mean what more can I say? I'm cooking the food on my own to my liking. Honestly, my main problem is the servers in this place. The first time I came here, I came with 2 friends and one of them is from England. When he finished paying, the server asked, \"Your lady friends tipped me and you're not?\" I was so shocked he even said those words! Mind you, they already charge you a mandatory 10% gratuity on your bill. My friend then went on telling him that tipping is not a serious thing back in England, people don't see it being as mandatory as it is here in Canada. I return with another friend and the server recognized me and said, \"oh thank god you didn't bring your England friend\". I just laughed and went on with my day. Then comes to time for us to pay. I paid using debit but I wanted to tip him cash so once I finished my debit transaction, the server yelled out loud in shock, \"OH NO TIP FOR ME?!\" I literally had my $10 bill out to tip him and when he noticed he was like oh I'm sorry. 

Apparently, I'm not the only person that been in this situation at this location. I know a hand full of people who complained about the servers demand they tip or complain when you don't tip enough. I just don't see how I need to tip you 20% when all you are doing is prepping raw foods and handing it to me and on top of that there is a mandatory gratuity tip for 10%."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best KBBQ places I've tried. The restaurant is clean and friendly, works on an all you can eat buffet system. The lunch menu (I think only offered till 3:30 pm) is significantly cheaper. 

LOVE the sliced beef and fish. 

Tip: make sure you don't over order, fine print on menu says you will be charged for any unused plates."}
{"text":"Decent place, all the meat and fish were nicely seasoned. Our server had a hard time remembering our order though. We ordered 1 of each item but he brought 2 orders of pork and beef. He also forgot to bring tofu after I repeatedly reminded him. When it was time to pay the bill they had already added a 10% tip but our server claims that only goes to the restaurant and any additional tip will go to him, which seemed so weird that the place only includes a tip that goes to the business. They really need to remove that 10% as it discourages people to add another tip for the servers"}
{"text":"Came here for the dinner and was pleasantly surprised! Loved the bolgogi and the short ribs were great. Didn't think the seafood was anything special but the spicy salmon sushi was great!! The service was luckily pretty good. Would come here again!"}
{"text":"Went back to Chako's yesterday for a holiday lunch with friends. 

This time, I thought the sauce for meat was actually better. I like the short rib, beef and pork. Short rib, takes a long time to cook though. Be sure to cook it thoroughly. Same if you were to get chicken or calamari. Not a fan of it here though. Calamari is tough and hard to eat, while chicken is very bland. But if you get chicken anyways, I suggest adding soy sauce while it's being grilled. Kinda makes it better. 

As for dessert, there is only a option of strawberry and vanilla ice cream. It tastes good, kind of like Chapman's ice cream.  They give you it in a little cup so you can take it out with you. Wish they had a green tea option. 

Please note: they charged extra during holiday season without posting it online. 
I think it's roughly from Dec. 24 until Jan.4? Please double check before going. For ex: lunch is usually $14.99, but during holiday will cost $15.99. 

This place is good for large groups, friends and family."}
{"text":"First time at a Korean BBQ place.Gotta say though, wasn't that impressed. For a $15.99 lunch menu, the menu was a little scarce. Main items included beef, short ribs, pork an chicken, to go along with miso soup, salad, calamari, fish, fried tofu, kimchi, green peppers and a green tea or mango ice cream.

The mango ice cream was the best thing on the menu, followed by the beef and pork that were seasoned perfectly.

The rest were mediocre and the fried tofu even tasted a bit off.

Overall, the food was ok, but I wish a few more things were added to the menu to add some diversity. We ended up ordering the same things and eventually just got bored with the dishes and decided to grab some ice cream and head out."}
{"text":"Marinated meat was lackluster.  Lunch was $5 dollar per person less than dinner but was half the menu.  There's an additional 10% service charge for bartenders, hostess and cleaning staff.  That does not include the tip for the servers which is a customary 10-15%.  I find it absurd that the owners was too lazy to cut costs other ways rather than pass the minimum wage increase to consumers.   Nobody wants a 25% service charge tacked on to their bill.  What a joke.  I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Boyfriend was thinking of going kbbq, and I ended up having to decide between Arirang and Chako. Hands-down, I would pick Chako now. It is a bit pricier than Arirang, but what you get is a good atmosphere, and good service. There was a bit of a wait time around the evening, but a walk around the plaza and our table was ready. Not to mention it's conjoined together with a Wasabi, you can get a small selection of sushi with your kbbq. Overall, I would recommend going here."}
{"text":"The grill was dirty. There was no lettuce (which is a must for Korean BBQ). Table was dirty. There was a 10% service charge which went to restaurant (why not include it in the price?). There was hair in our radish. The bean sprouts tasted funky (not funky good). The rice was too bland. 
What was good here? The server tried his best. He was nice. Marinate of the beef was ok."}
{"text":"Great place food was tasteful, seasoned well. I appreciate that the all you can eat is one price that includes all meat and cold dishes unlike some places that have various prices depending on which meats you want.  The service  isn't that great but I felt the language barrier might have something to do with it. I also didn't appreciate that you have to request for your grill to be changed."}
{"text":"Korean BBQ.  Monday-Thursday AYCE special $10 after10PM!

On the special menu:
Short Ribs - Mini steaks basically, oh so delectable.
Beef - Sliced thin for fast cooking & has a hint of seasoning of some sort.
Calamari - Flavor orgasm in my mouth, also it cooks very fast.
Kimchee - Optimal & I had it rated by an actual Korean man from Korea.
Fish - Tilapia fillets, marinated with some sort of sauce but if you are patient enough to cook this it is well worth the wait. 
Steamed Rice - l personally use it as a grease napkin by distributing it over my plate evenly to soak excess oils from my meat, but the actual rice is quite good on its own.

As time passes, the iron grill will accumulate lard & meat debris which will form into black sludge after a while due to flame exposure, however, when asked to an attendant will remove the old grill & replace with a freshly oiled one.  Service is optimal especially being an AYCE restaurant as the servers are quick & proactive.

The washrooms are interesting in the sense that they are semi communal for both sexes, a central hall lined by doors that when opened reveal a separate washroom much in the style of a home washroom sans bath or shower equipment.

Definitely returning again & again!"}
{"text":"Came here afew times and its always been good. Fairly large restaurant and service has always been good, busy or not. Love grilling all the yummy meat. The only problem I had was that the chicken pieces were too large to completely cook and burns before it's fully cooked. Although this isnt the traditional Korean BBQ, the prices are very good considering it's AYCE. 
Make sure to get as much short ribs and beef you can eat to get your moneys worth. The downside is that it can get really smokey and cancerous inside!"}
{"text":"Have only had the late night after 10:30pm Menu - when it's $13.99 AYCE Korean BBQ.

Have been to several Korean BBQ's and this one rates a little higher than most.

There are some that don't have Veggies - but this late nighter has Zuchini and Green and Red Peppers.  You get the standard meats and cold dishes.

Seating is great - you get a nightclub/lounge vibe from it.

The servers I have had were pretty nice.  (Been twice).  

Overall no complaints - will get your Korean BBQ Fix over here.  Will come again and try the non-late night menu."}
{"text":"Chako is good if you want bang for buck.
Located at McNicol and Midland, Chako has been here for some time. 
Their prices for the selection of meats and sushi you get is pretty good, a definite step up from Korean Grill. 
However in terms of quality of cuts you receive is questionable especially if you're comparing this to \"traditional\" Korean BBQ which is not AYCE. 
Dinner prices during the week is approximately $22.99/person, on weekends its a lot more. 
The services is friendly and efficient.  As for ambiance the place is presentable with various contemporary decor to give it a modern look. 

**Please note they also tag along an automatic 10% service charge on your bill which the server in this case notified us."}
{"text":"The food was as good or better than usual. What's new however is the addition of a 10% service charge, even when dining as a couple. We tip fairly generously but don't like it forced on us. Bad call."}
{"text":"I have been to Chako a few times to satisfy KBBQ cravings, mainly because it's in the area. The service is fast, communication can be a little difficult at times but overall okay, and I think they can do a better job at cleaning the tables and area. I wouldn't necessarily recommend this place, but also don't know of any other great KBBQ places around the area.

Expect to spend about $70 for two people at dinner time."}
{"text":"We went there without any reservations yesterday, and we didn't know that lunch time was only until 330pm.
Nevertheless, once seated they gave us all the food we wanted and more. We were famished because it is already late lunch time, but the waiter assigned to us was very accommodating, and gave all the particular orders we wanted.
It was our first time there but definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Don't eat at Chako Barbecue - Mississauga unless you want your orders to be forgotten, come late, and have your server say \"so do you want your bill?\" when they get sick of you. I've never had someone say they ran out of salad to get me out of a restaurant. But if none of this bugs you, go ahead and make a reservation today!"}
{"text":"Went Saturday for lunch place was good, very clean, food was good for AYCE, staff was very attentive, lunch is 20 bucks a head on Saturdays plus they add an auto tip of 10%, then waiter informs customer that this tip is for the restaurant staff but if you like the waiter add a little something more for him."}
{"text":"I have always been a big Korean BBQ fan. Used to got to the Korean Grills House downtown quite often.  Very glad there is a good place in 'sauga now.  Have been here 2 times now,  lunch and  dinner.  I find the price to be very fair.  I can get everything I like with the regular price, vs the new price structure at Grill House, I have to upgrade and few things I do not even touch.  I find the meat to be very nice. Nicely cut, clean and good taste.  

Service was decent. The first time for lunch, I think we had the manager mainly assisting us, and he checked on us quite often.  The 2nd time for dinner, there were plenty of servers around, but they did not go to the tables as much, at least not ours anyways. There was 1 girl going around just making small conversations, that was nice I guess.  Will go back for lunch. Sushi was ok, but I do not go to this place for sushi so I do not see the need to pay more just to have the same things you can get with lunch."}
{"text":"Meat is ok.  Value is great.  The shortribs are really bad quality, but everything else is ok."}
{"text":"Chako is an amazing all-you-can-eat, cook it yourself kind of restaurant. I always like to come here with my friends when we feel like eating a large amount of food. The restaurant's menu offers the usual meat and seafood items (and some veggies too). We usually order short ribs, sliced beef, chicken, fish and calamari. 

If you're with someone who has experience grilling meat, you'll be fine. I found it difficult at times to know when the meat was ready as I don't have much experience cooking. The beef and the ribs are definitely the best and don't take much time to cook. The chicken however takes ages to cook and really isn't my favourite. Unfortunately a lot of the staff don't speak fluent english and were often very busy, so don't reply in them to help you check if your meat is ready. 

Don't be fooled by the $$ rating, you definitely get your money's worth with the AYCE option."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Korean BBQ and I might be too picky but I think the food was very average and the service was slow. Took a while to get a hold of someone. Our waitress brought us dishes that we did not order (at the very beginning) and placed them in front of us. The table was very small so few of us had no place at the table, just piles and piles of meats.
The meat was not the best quality. Very, very thin, over cooked easily; chicken was the worst - lots of fat and bad pieces. I wouldn't come again."}
{"text":"Chako is alright.

It is where you go when you're hungry with a group of friends late at night. Sushi is not very good, but the meat is okay. If you're going at regular dinner-price, it might be better to choose something else because it is pretty pricey.

I think they were shut down for a while for health violations, but I don't think they really changed anything."}
{"text":"Great environment great food , really big chakos compared to the other ones in the GTA."}
{"text":"Good all-you-can-eat deal for Korean BBQ and some sushi. Nice quality meat especially the beef.  The short ribs are quite good too. It's all-you-can-eat so you won't run out of kimchi, although there's not a lot of variety- only the standard red cabbage kind. I was slightly disappointed by the lack of condiments (leaves, garlic, red pepper paste) to go with the BBQ meat, but the meat was very good. I'd come back here for sure."}
{"text":"I will give it two stars ONLY for the food, which is completely overpowered by how poor the service is!! Couldn't believe the inconsiderate, couldn't care less attitude we got from the receptionist and the waiters! The girl doesn't even want to talk, came from the back as if doing us a favour! Book an appointment and end up waiting 30 minutes! 
Too bad, their food is actually good! But to be treated like that is not worth it!!!!"}
{"text":"Was there yesterday night. Not so many choices, lamb are too sweet, beef too fat and salty. Basically, not very good."}
{"text":"I want to make this review short as possible.

My friend and i love KOREAN BBQ and me as being a Kpop fanatic was craving for some.  So i told my friend, what the heck; i'll treat you to the newly opened KBBQ at Courtney Park. While driving, i called up to make a reservation just in case it gets busy because it was a friday night. Or course i didn`t want to not make a reservation and then wait for half an hour to get seated.  This Chako place is actually co-joined with Wasabi, so people has a choice of wanting KBBQ or Sushi.  The KBBQ has the same menu as the KBBQ in downtown Toronto, but they don't serve sushi or i guess you dont have the choice of wanting sushi on the downtown Toronto KBBQ. Chako had that option which i like because i don't like ordering a lot of sushi and then not eat it after, otherwise they'll be put in the waste.  

As my friend was driving and i called in to make reservations, the host (since it was a guy talking to me over the phone) told me that if i wasn`t there on time; they would give up my reservation after 10 mins of my reservation time. At least he did some explaining and i get that since i do work at a restaurant and i also understand because it is a friday night.  I actually came to Chako with my brother and his Korean gf ( i actually do call her eonni ^^) for the first time after watching a movie before and let me tell you, the service was good; probably not as good when it came down for my dad's birthday last year?, filipino parents never listens when it comes to going to restaurants.  They think that it's ok to go inside the restaurant and get a seat right away...i mean, i work at a restaurant, i know how it all works. You wait and wait till you get seated and you get heated up if you dont get seated right away...BEEN THERE AND HAVE DONE THAT. So the last time i went for with my dad's birthday at Chako, the server was missing a lot of our orders and we had to remind them what we wanted over and over again. I guess it is because that the restaurant is co-joined so they may be serving the Wasabi section as well too?

But other than that, my friend and i sat down and got a quick service and i really LIKED it a lot.  I was praying that they wouldn't forget what we wanted.  The Galbi for this KBBQ joint...they cut it so THICK that when you fry it onto their grill...it's soooo JUICY!

haha, i said i was going to make this review short; i guess not.  I would recommend this restaurant though. It's a WIN WIN."}
{"text":"When I entered, from the online menu, I thought that the price l was ~$17.99, however they have changed the price to almost $22 per person. The food was decent. The beef was great, the pork tasted strange, chicken was okay and the ribs were very fatty and rubbery. The calamari was vile but the dessert (green tea and mango ice cream) made up for it. Our server was excellent as he kept on refilling our water and asking how we did. In the end, I saw the bill and it looked strangely high for 3 people and he sort of kept the bill away from me but I eventually got to it and saw that there was already a 10% tip on the bill. He stated that this was for the kitchen and any extra tips is for him. So fair enough, I tipped an extra 10% although I do not know how truthful he was. In the end I spent $90 for 3 people. I can say that it was not worth the price compared to other KBBQ."}
{"text":"All You Can Eat, they don't cheap out on the meat quantities when to a good Korean Bbq grill. Ask and it keeps coming. Definitely on the saltier side of marinade, but a good bite nonetheless. Don't be rocking your best outfit here because the space and lack of insulation and hoods available above the grill makes this place Smokey and attached to clothes, hair, anything that smell can breath into. Pricing reasonable for the food quantity. Easy to access and find as it's situated in one of the large popular cineplex plazas where you can grab a bite and eat like a cos, then catch a movie after and slumber away if you ate to much. All you can eat, quantity over quality, what more can I say. Service is attentive and easy to call and replenish servings. There's also all you can eat sushi ontop of the BBQ that's included in the price. If you don't mind eating your fill and have a large appetite to eat your value back, enjoy! Drinks extra."}
{"text":"I love going to chako! All locations have always been good!! Food is great and comes out super quick! Service is always excellent too!
My reason for taking off a star is that for some reason this location, the beef and pork is always shredded and harder to cook. The other location has nice slices of meat which makes for easy grilling and a tastier outcome!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Orders come quick and all of the items are delicious! I have to admit this location is better than the one I've been to in mississauga, their cuts of meat are much easier to grill and I find the marinade on the chicken is much better! Always fantastic!!"}
{"text":"We went to Chako's for my friend's birthday. We wanted to try Korean BBQ and an all you can eat place like this one seemed like the logical route to take. We went on a Friday night, a party of six at around 9 PM, and we were seated immediately. The ambiance is nice and dim, with the centrepiece of the table being the two built in grills. The menu is simple and short, with your choice of all kinds of meats ranging from pork and ribs to shrimp, scallop, mussels, and ox tongue (which I highly recommend, absolutely delicious!). The quantities were massive, and every single meat is spiced to perfection, with maximum cooking time for thin pieces of meat and lamb (and Ox tongue!) being 3 minutes. The chicken, steak, and scallop took a while though. They also offer a wide range of sushi like salmon and butterfish, along with avocado, spicy salon, and California rolls. They have a bunch of hand rolls as well, offered with a choice of miso soup, salad, or/and rice as a side (all inclusive with the all you can eat fee). I didn't pay for myself so I'm not sure how much, but I think it's around 23.99$ per person, but with a constant supply of food which you can order at any minute during your meal. They also offer vanilla and strawberry ice cream. After you pay your bill, you're given a warm steamed towel to freshen up. All in all would definitely recommend, especially for a large group of people looking to have a good time and require a fork lift to be lifted off their seats from all the food! 

TLDR; Aces, highly recommend. Great food. Lots of fun. Lots of food."}
{"text":"Came here with a couple of friends, this is an average korean BBQ place in Scarborough - really close to the border of Markham.

It's really hard to get a parking spot the place is filled. Upon entering the restaurant, it is very declarative and nice. The food was fresh and tasted really good. I like how the servers were always checking on us to make sure everything was alright. The bathrooms are pretty nice and clean, definitely a plus. The place is really noisy and can get on your nerves. The selection is quite limited to certain things. But overall, it's a great restaurant and you'll definitely feel full by the end !

3/5"}
{"text":"went two Saturdays ago with the gf for lunch $11.99. note: NO SUSHI during lunch. drinks another $2 or so. service was attentive and always made sure our drinks we refilled. asked us if we wanted more meat/side dishes often as well. ice cream was meh so 4 stars instead of 5. will be back"}
{"text":"Came to Chako in a party of 6 yesterday. We usually go to the korean grill house. It's about the same i'd say. Chako also serves some sushi which is nice if you want some variety. And they have these 'specials' for each day of the week, like $2 fountain drinks - this is a normal price at korean grill house btw so it's not really a special... either way it's good a place to get your meat fix. They have other things on the menu that are NOT extra charge like pineapple, veggies, etc., so that's a 1-up on korean grill house they have but aside from that, you get what you pay for here, and if you can eat A LOT then this place is for you!"}
{"text":"First time here and man, so worth the price.

The staff were really tentative, constantly checking up on me and my girlfriend to see if we needed anything else and they were overall very nice. Our waiter Jason also explained some stuff to us too like to call him if our grill looks too dry (the meat won't cook properly, meat is very dry or may burn faster) which I thought was really nice to know. I think this place has a problem with the ventilation though because I left smelling like the meat I grilled LOL. So make sure you either leave any outerwear that absorb smells in the surrounding area into the fabric in the car or don't wear it to Chako.

Anyways, the food. For lunch, you get a salad with ponzu dressing, miso soup and rice to start off. There is only 4 choices of banchan: fried tofu, bean sprouts, pickled radish and kimchi. We didn't get tofu (long story). For grilling items, there was chicken, beef, pork, short ribs, calamari, fish, red & green peppers and zucchini. Didn't get the fish because it breaks too easily. My favourite would have to be the short ribs hands down...the marinate on it was delish. I am not going to get the veggies because they weren't seasoned or anything..no good. The chicken was what I assume to be chicken breast cut into smaller pieces and marinated, cooking this was a pain in the behind since it may look cooked on the inside but it isn't plus it takes forever to cook. Finally, dessert...there is only 2 options: mango or green tea ice cream. I got both. The mango ice cream was good. The green tea ice cream was like a semi scoop of just ice. Goes to show they place the ice cream way too far in the freezer. I want to taste the matcha and not just chewing solid ice while I eat. 

Conclusion: Will come back but they need to fix the VENTILATION. I ate here today at 12:30pm and now it's 9pm...my jacket still smells like grilled meat and I currently have it hanging in front of my fan to air out the smell..."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on Saturday night and overall it was an okay experience. Their menu is extensive and has more options for the weekend. This includes additional sides such as kim chi, bean sprouts, radish and tofu. They also provide sushi (rolls), seafood (tiger shrimp, calamari, and fish), additional meats (lamb, ox tail) and desserts (chocolate mouse) that are not available during the week. The cost per person is $25.99. We had a great server who was very attentive; I think his name was Bou. He was very proactive and checked in on us several times during our meal. The meat is flavorful, the seafood is frozen not fresh and the sides are okay. We ordered rice, miso soup, bean sprouts and kim chi for our sides. I did find the kimchi sweet which was weird to me. The environment is modern but way too warm to enjoy a meal. At one point, our server acknowledged this but I think that management should really think about investing in stronger fans to suck up the exhaust from the grills or to turn up the air conditioning. Hence, overall, the experience was okay."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of friends the other day and it was my first time ever eating Korean Barbeque! The place was crowded when we got there.This place is a good start for those who have never had KBBQ before. It also has sushi rolls and hand rolls for the people who aren't so crazy about eating loads of meat like we did. A few of the orders were missed, but overall, it's a pretty good experience. :)"}
{"text":"i would say this is one of the descent bbq restaurant in the area...have a various choices of meat and a good tasting dessert. more important a reasonable price range for both students and young teens...but the only concern i have with the restaurant is their vegetable...my friends who have worked there, said their vegetable are not properly washed and actually had made a few customer sicked before...otherwise everything is good and a good places to chill with your friends"}
{"text":"Chako is my place of choice when introducing people to Korean BBQ. Is it authentic? Maybe not 100% but whatever they do, they do it well. Our group had two rookies and three veterans who have been coming here for years.

The recessed grills in the middle of the table always has newbies guessing at what's about to happen. The vast menu choices usually leaves them a little confused, not realizing they get everything on the menu. Our server took our drink orders and our newbies mulled over the menu. The rest of us didn't need to look.

Our drinks arrived and we asked our server to just bring everything on the menu - soup, salad, rice, sushi, veggies, meats, seafood - everything. The food started showing up (in volumes) and our rookie guests' eyes were growing in amazement. It looked like a lot of food. It was a lot.

The cooking started, the eating started, the rookies were smiling and really started to get into it. The language of the moment was Mmm. Although it was a lot of food, we ended up ordering more short ribs, sliced beef, and pineapple. It was all good. We were stuffed but willing to stuff ourselves even more.

The rookies thoroughly enjoyed their first KBBQ experience and are already planning their next visit and guest list. Our server, Chuck, was excellent, providing probably the best service I've had at Chako. We'll be back. With more rookies. We'll ask for Chuck."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Chako in a while because of Korean Grill House being cheaper and closer to my house. But after finally going to this place because of a birthday dinner, I realized that I prefer KGH. While Chako dinner offers sushi and other things (ox tongue, fruits) whereas KGH has your regular meat and fish, what upset me about Chako was they don't have salmon! I love that I get unlimited salmon at KGH lol. It's my favourite part. But service is friendly, quick, and efficient. I was part of a big group and a worker asked if he could start the bills early, so we wouldn't all be waiting for the machine at the end. I think I'll stick to KGH though."}
{"text":"Food alone 3.5 stars
Overall 4 stars

We came here because we felt like having AYCE and something hot, but we were taken back by the overall cost of AYCE hot pot.  AYCE grilled meat at Chako costed less, so here we came.  

The environment here was nice, though dimmed.  The meat was well marinated, so it tasted good.  The cut of the beef short rib was too chewy; I much preferred ox tongue.  The fish, chicken, beef, pork were delicious (or passable if you have higher standards).  We arrived early, so the store wasn't busy.  We enjoyed very attentive and efficient services.  We didn't order any Japanese dishes, so no comment on them.

I don't think anyone would hate or be particular with the food and environment here.  At this price point, Chako offers above average value.  There is some type of beverages deal every weekday."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best Asian BBQ restaurants in the area, I've been to many and this one tops them all! If you ask for a clean grill they bring you a fresh one from the back, which no other place I've been to does. The mango ice cream is so good!!! Awesome friendly staff. Great experience overall."}
{"text":"My definite local go-to spot whenever I need my KBBQ fix (although it's not authentic Korean BBQ)! The atmosphere is always great and I just can't seem to get tired of the food, despite making a trip there at least 2-3 times a month. I suggest the beef and ribs, you can't go wrong! 

The place is sometimes unpredictably busy so always call ahead and make a reservation, just in case. I personally head over there during their late night special (about $13.99 all you can eat) but keep in mind that the menu is slightly different during the night (no sushi). That aside, the price is phenomenal for what you get. Guaranteed to be stuffed by the time you pay your bill. 

Only reason I'm giving them a 4/5 rather than a 5/5 is because of their service. Servers can be a little more attentive but I understand that they do get insanely busy and overwhelmed. 

Overall, highly recommended! Remember to finish off your meal with some mango flavoured ice-cream! Delish."}
{"text":"Went in here for a double date! Easy to find, clean and no shortage of parking space. Stress free coming into the restaurant.

The place didn't seem busy for a Friday night, lots of seating and lots of servers, but this is where my experience goes downhill.

The food is the same as every other Korean BBQ grill House, unlimited rice with  side dishes that consist of Kimchee, Tofu, radish, potato, etc. and Meats that consist of pork, short ribs, chicken, shrimp, ox tongue, etc. Also, they now serve sushi with the dinner price.

First round was basic, they bring out everything and everything looks good. However, by the time we order our second round and third round the service for our table went downhill. They missed our orders, bringing the wrong items and consistently have to wave waiters and ask them politely to remember our request. At one point, we asked for 1 tray of vegetables and shrimps, they came back with 4 trays of mushrooms! What do we do with 4 trays of mushroom?!

I cannot comment on the meat, since we cooked it. The sushi was not to par at all, of what sushi has to be. You are better off buying at Metro instead of paying 25 dollars here. 

This experience was horrible. It's too bad that it's that Mississauga location is the bad one. I love the Chako in the Richmond Hill area.

The only positive in this experience is that, they do cheaper deals for late night goers. Extra star!"}
{"text":"Beef, chicken, fish filet, tiger prawn, mussels to BBQ, verities of Sushi rolls. Great experience, good food.... must to go there again"}
{"text":"Good place to have a good meal with friends and family. They have wide range of well marinated foods... beef, chicken, calamari, shrimp, fish.  The sushi and hand rolls are also good. The place is quite crowded and the noise level is also moderately high... but a nice place to enjoy a casual evening."}
{"text":"All you can eat Korean here is awesome! The waiter delivers the food pretty fast and service was great! The menu is a bit small but at least there's plenty of meat. If you come after 10pm, you can get the late night special. There's less choices but still a good deal for the price!"}
{"text":"We came here for all you can eat Korean BBQ and it was pretty good. The service was pretty fast and the waiter constantly made sure our water was filled. The menu isn't very big for lunch. It had peppers, zuchini, green salad, miso soup, chicken, pork, sliced beef, beef ribs, squid, three kinds of Korean side dishes, and two flavours of ice cream. At night, you'll have sushi options too. But sushi isn't very good there.

All the meats were marinated nicely but the beef ribs were cut pretty thick so it took forever to cook. Other than that, not much to say about the food. They were pretty good. If you're a big eater, beware that the waiter only changes the grill plate once so if you eat a lot, you'll probably have a hard time cooking your food near the end without getting burnt stuff all over your food. We found out the hard way!

This is probably one of the better Korean BBQ places around. Prices are a little higher than say Korean Grill House but food is marinated better too."}
{"text":"Came here for late night kbbq tonight.  Can't go wrong for $13.99 (they increased the price recently).  It also starts later now at 10:30pm (used to be 10:00pm).  

The new prices :

Mon-Thu weekday lunch $11.99
Mon-Thu weekday dinner $17.99
Mon-Thu weekday late night $11.99 (starts 10:30pm, last call 12am, leave by 1am)
Fri-Sun weekend lunch $13.99
Fri-Sun weekend dinner $19.99
Fri-Sun weekend late night $13.99 (starts 10:30pm, last call 12am, leave by 1am)

The selection of all you can eat food is noticeably less for late night, but still includes soup, rice, dessert.  Food came very fast.

The food is tasty and good quality (meat not much fat).  Service is also very good.  I would have liked to see beef ribs/riblets (my favourite korean food) but apparently the short ribs are pork.  You can ask the waiters to change the grill when it gets too charred.

The decor and atmosphere is wonderful.  Mostly young people here.  A nice place to bring your friends.  Note this place is always busy just like the Richmond Hill location so be prepared for a line up.  There is also the mandatory 10% service charge on your bill so be sure not to over tip.  This is a probably the most popular place for kbbq in GTA and is still a full house even with the price hike."}
{"text":"Great place to bring a group to eat. I have been here numerous times and there the food is good.  The service varies sometimes but overall the experience is good and the atmosphere is great.  If you want to enjoy a good time with friends and really like barbecue then this is a good place to go.  The reason why I give a 4 star is because of the service at times, and the sushi is average. It doesn't out way the other food though. The bbq is great."}
{"text":"I like Chako slightly better than Korean Grill house (only SLIGHTLY), for several reasons:
1. It's newer. Despite Korean Grill House's recent renovations, Chako still looks newer and has a lot more space, so I don't feel so crowded.
2. If I go to Chako, I only go for the 'late night' menu because it's cheaper. That being said, I haven't gone for lunch so my review (obviously) excludes that. I wouldn't come here for lunch, anyway, having seen the prices. I know I'm likely to get better sushi elsewhere.
3. Their Korean barbecue menu also includes vegetables (where at KGH, they're an additional cost). I don't eat more than one round of the vegetables anyway (I'm there for the AYCE MEAT!) but it's nice to have the option.

The service at KGH exceeds that of Chako, I presume because it's a smaller setting. This shouldn't really be an excuse on Chako's part, but it's likely the reason. I can only really justify coming here past 10pm, otherwise I find their prices to be a little steep, considering I'm cooking my own food (I realize sushi's involved, but from the sounds of other reviews, it's not worth the extra money either). All in all, both places have their good & bad. At the end of the day, my decision is based pretty solely on what time it is."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch on a Thursday afternoon over the holidays. The restaurant was fairly packed. Our server was quite attentive as before we even ordered extra side dishes, she had already brought them to our table! For the food, chicken was the highlight from the lunch menu. It was moist and well marinated. I had initially expected the short ribs to be the star. However, they were too thick and tasted a little under seasoned for my liking. The pork was unevenly seasoned as one piece had a very strong garlicky taste while there wasn't a hint of garlic on the other one! We ordered a salad along with banchan (side dishes). The salad was disappointing for it was served as an un-torn lettuce wedge. Just not very appetizing in my opinion. Lastly, the beef was mediocre, nothing too special. Overall, I might come back if I don't feel like driving too far for KBBQ and the price is pretty decent as well."}
{"text":"\"All You Can Stomach\"

Chako is primarily an AYCE (all-you-can-eat) Korean BBQ place. It offers up 4 different kinds of meat, some seafood and a few maki rolls and nigiri sushi. It is connected with Wasabi which is an AYCE Japanese place that opened a few years ago, but has recently lost its mass appeal.

You enter one door now and can go to Chako or Wasabi. As a Korean BBQ restaurant, Chako has cooking tables that feature a grill in which you cook your own raw food brought out by the servers. As an AYCE place there are several stress points and strategies to making your experience worthwhile. Overall, if you plan on consuming a huge amount of beef and simple sushi, this might be the place for you.

There is a two hour time limit and even though this is enough time to enjoy a meal, there seems to be added stress when you can't find wait staff when you need them. There is a $5 per dish that is not consumed and as such you may not want to order a lot more than you think you can eat.

The wait staff however are present and you can basically flag anyone down to help you. Regarding other reviewer comments about the courteousness of the staff, don't be surprised if some of them don't appear to be the \"friendliest\" of servers. They are all busy, running around and as such they may not take the time you would like to explain things and help you along. Like many other AYCE places, this is a production mindset with servers buzzing around bringing new dishes and changing grills when they get clogged with burnt pieces of food.

The interior is simple. modern and comfortable. The food selection is adequate and there are some extra items on the weekend (like salmon) that are nice additions. On the meat side, they have plain thinly sliced beef which is my favorite. The pieces are lean, cook fast and dipped in the BBQ sauce with some steamed rice, tastes very good. However the other items like short-ribs and ox tongue are not as tasty. And ordering the prawns may be an exercise in futility since it takes some time and patience to peel off the shell and the head, all to reveal a rather tasteless piece of seafood. Way too much work when you're on the clock :-)

The bill with tip for 2 adults was $70. And as such, the main differentiator in choosing a places like Chako, over what is probably the best Korean BBQ in Missisauga (Miga) comes down to how much food you can consume. Other places like Miga, offer a better selection of items for the grill and in my opinion better quality meats. And if you want, they will even cook it for you.

Finally I think that the Korean BBQ AYCE experience may work for a group of 4 or less and for very large groups, it could be an issue with all that cooking going on. Overall Chako is a good Korean BBQ place with decent food and a nice interior."}
{"text":"You can smell the greasy grills from the parking lot. I have to say the AYCE BBQ lunch for $12.99 is pretty decent. It is much better than the one I ate recently at Seoul BBQ. The cuts of meat were definitely of higher quality, especially the ribs. Service was quick and when you have stuffed yourself with all the meat you can eat there is even ice cream at the end. Side dishes were also to my liking with kimchii, radish, miso soup, bean sprouts and tofu as the options. No lettuce wrap available here but that's okay because rice is also available with the meal. Great value, decent food with great service."}
{"text":"The good: I remember back in the days where Chako and Destiny ruled their respective genre of food. Presently, Chako is still going decently as a go to place for not-so-legit Korean BBQ, and yet it still has people going. It's a one of those places where you feel like you crave it and then after going, you will totally regret that you even thought about the place.

The bad: it ain't premium meat like gyu kaku, but it's decent. I can't complain because it is what it is. They are all you can eat and they do have a good selection of food.

The ugly: price can be a bit expensive but like I mentioned, it is all you can eat.

Neutral: great for groups, come with an empty stomach, you can ask for the grill to be changed if it becomes too burnt! :)"}
{"text":"This was my second visit to chako's. It was Better than my first in terms of service and the food quality. I was still not impressed with food taste in comparison to other Korean BBQ places with better seasoned and marinated meat. It's a good choice in having the sushi variety and I liked the vegetable options that were also included but the meat for me is what sells and the beef and lamb marinades were non existent. I would like to see more flavouring added either to marinades or condiment options at the table."}
{"text":"2017 Review - Once upon a time, Chako was a solid 4. It was the better all you can eat KBBQ joint with higher quality meats than some other popular restaurants, and better service. And then some time passed and other players came into the market.... and this girl grew up, started working and making her own money and discovered more quality KBBQ joints.. but even then, I still get requests to go to Chako once in a while and so I go. And then I can't remember why I liked it at all. Is it me? Did my expectations sky rocket? Or did the quality and value plummet? I mean,  the meat is still decent quality but it's just not tasty anymore. The service is also spotty and they kept forgetting my orders. Side dishes don't look fresh or tasty anymore. Overall, no longer a fan. Prices didn't drop but quality and service definitely did."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Korean BBQ spot and I was really impressed. The food came out really quickly and was really good quality. We ordered one of everything on the menu and doubled up on most of the meats. I guess the idea of having to cook your own food at a restaurant sounds weird to me but it makes sense because you can cook everything the way you like it. 

I did wish they had more of a selection of meats for lunch, but the dinner menu has some more interesting options and also includes some sushi. 

Overall, Chako was a great experience but watch out who is cooking the food because there will always be that one person who forgets about something and burns some of the food."}
{"text":"I'm surprised noone complained about the seating in this place. I'm 5'7\", and I can barely fit in the booth seats. I can't imagine anyone taller than 5'10\" who would be able to seat properly.

I've been to this one and the one in Richmond Hill. Some things this place is better, some Richmond Hill is better (for example, the seating). This place has better calamari, ox tongue, and pork, while Richmond Hill has better kimchi, beef, and chicken.

Service is weird in this place; for me, they took out all the plates they offer, showed it to us, and asked us which ones we wanted. Contrast to Richmond Hill, where you order the plates you want and they give it to you. Aside from the food aspect, the cheque took a while to come, and we had to wait a long time before they changed the plate for us.

Overall, I like Richmond Hill's slightly better, but the pork here is so delicious..."}
{"text":"I was here on a Sunday afternoon, so it wasnt that busy, but the service was phenomenal. Our waiter came around every ten minutes to refill water/drinks, was very attentive, and quick to serving food. 

The food was great as well- i loved the pork the most."}
{"text":"Came here today with my sisters for lunch all you can eat. The service was pretty good since the waiters/waitresses were attentive. We ordered a lot of beef and chicken, and tried an order of calamari. The beef was good and so were the cold dishes. However I felt that the chicken didn't taste that great... The way the seasoned it made it taste funny. It tasted like a cross between satay and curry, but to each their own. Calamari was very big in portion but they were extremely chewy. The atmosphere of the place was nice and they were playing some older pop songs. The restaurant wasn't too packed even though we came around noon time on a friday. Overall the food was good for the price ,13.99 for adults and the service was great! We kept ordering ice creams at the end and the waitress was extremely friendly and fine with walking back and forth multiple times bringing us ice cream!"}
{"text":"Best miso soup ever. Great Maki and sushi preparations. Service quick polite and effective. Great ambience and environment. Will surely return."}
{"text":"Awesome place, great food, spectacular drinks, service is top notch too. However, if you want variety you gotta wait till dinner rolls in before there's actually any choices. During lunch your choices are extremely limited to about 20 choices compared to dinner which had more than double the choices. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"I came here a couple of times after craving some quick Korean BBQ. First time I came here,  we were told that we had to pay the dinner price but just without the sushi and various other dinner items. Which made no sense. Turns out, we couldn't even get the late night/lunch menu even though it was 30 mins to 10:00PM (when latenight starts). Because of that we had to wait 30 mins to get the reduced price. That experience wasn't the greatest. It was just a prime example of bad customer service. 

Recently came here again. The food is alright. The meat is not very marinated, and some meat will feel more dry. This time we got the dinner menu, and the meat seems fresher. Other than that, the service was alright. 

Overall, the quality is OK. Not the greatest and certainly not the worst."}
{"text":"Buyer beware. The restaurant charges a \"10%\" service fee (that does NOT include the tip for your server). Now, I've paid service fees at restaurants for large groups (more than 10), but NEVER for a party of 2 at lunch. So think about it... menu price + taxes+\" service fee\"+ tip for the server = menu prices + an additional 33%, all for mediocre quality food and skimpy side dishes. I don't mind paying money for good food; conversely, I'm sensible enough to compromise on quality for value; but I don't like greedy businesses that rip their trusting customers off. I sucked it up today and gave my server a full tip, but how many patrons end up giving servers less tip because of this joke of a \"service charge\"? Like another Yelper said, this practice should be illegal and in my opinion borderline wage theft. 
The beef and pork options were tasty, but they didn't have sesame oil/salt for dipping when I asked. The side dishes (bean sprouts, tofu curd, radish, and kimchi) were flavorful, but the portion sizes are ridiculously small. The bean sprouts come out all smooshed, pretty sure they just stacked the dishes on top of one another (food safety?!). And the kimchi had a slightly slippery film to it... thank goodness we didn't get sick. Not coming back."}
{"text":"$16 for all you can eat korean barbecue with some Japanese sushi rolls thrown into the mix.
Good since drowning in meat might be a bit disadvantageous to your bodily functions. So take a break in the middle and eat some rolls. Or order some greens to grill, they have some (zucchini is by far the best!) for you to order too.

Good food, fast service, and the people working there were super nice also! I came here with two friends and it turns out they knew one of the people working there which made it slightly awkward to have him serve us, but everyone there was very nice and accommodating.

For those who have not been to kbbq before:
COOKING TIMES: beef grills the fastest (especially if you like it rare), and pork is pretty fast too. Chicken is next but it takes some time to get the inside cooked completely. Ribs take a century. Seafood takes a while too. Veggies are up to you, how long you want to cook them. Usually I like to put a mix of slow cooking and fast cooking stuff on the grill so you can enjoy the fast cooking stuff while the others roast.
THE GRILL: the metal plate thing on the grill will get covered in charr if you let the food stay there for too long and it burns. And then when you cook other stuff, the charr will get onto them. Not fun. So you can get the plate thing changed once per meal so I would do so near the middle, maybe after your first or second round of ordering.

And a note about this place: they're pretty slow with bringing the sushi/rolls (I assume since they make them when you order them) so order them early or else they might never arrive."}
{"text":"Nice place for Korean bbq compared to other places in the area. Chako feels much cleaner in comparison. The food was consistent like it always is. 
The meats and appetizers are delivered quickly to your table initially. After the first round of meat, it gets a little difficult to track your server down. Our server gave us a little speech when we were paying to hustle some tips because the tip that's added to your bill is actually a \"house tip\".. Not sure why they don't just add it to the charge upfront so their servers can get tipped for real."}
{"text":"Honestly,I am not impressve about this place.food is fine. two things I didnt like :one is the service. it needs a big improvement.it seems they were short hands secondly, the whole place had kind of bad smoky smell.  air dynamic problem? I dont know"}
{"text":"Went there with an old friend from my college days last Saturday, April 13th. Lots of food for 2 for 60$. They bring you the raw meat and vegetables and seafood and you cook it yourself on the grill which is built into the restaurant tables. Waiters pass often and clean the empty plates. It was my first time in Scarborough, it's literally a little Asia in North America."}
{"text":"I would definitely recommend that you make reservations if you're coming here on a weekend. On Friday-Sunday and holidays, it's $20.99 for dinner and there are more food and sushi selections than lunch.
Overall, the meat here seems very fresh and the selection was good. I personally didnn't like the short ribs because it wasn't very tender. I also didn't like the Chako beef because it was very thickly cut but my friends seem to like it.
For dessert, there was mango ice cream, green tea ice cream, mango pudding and red bean pudding. They also have pineapple that you can technically count as dessert. (Grilled pineapple is the best!)
I personally don't like AYCE but I think this place is decent. The service was good and they brought us most of the food that we asked for. It's a good place to try if you're craving some KBBQ!"}
{"text":"A wonderful experience!!!
It's a Korean tabletop barbecue Great experience 
Tried Chako out for lunch Nd went with the buffet 
They brought in the raw marinated thin slices of meats and veggies 
We cooked it on the table grill so needed some patience but was a fantastic meal 
I think it was about $23 + tax for each person The sad part is they didn't have appetisers only the mains unlike some other Korean places They didn't give any sauces Had to ask for it
The miso soup was good 
For the mains they didn't have much choice 
Only 3/4 options but was good  had to ask for the dipping sauce for which they gave some plain soya sauce 
The mango dessert was great too 
I've been to better Korean places where for the buffet they also give appetisers 
Though limited choice this place was good 
A great experience 
Every person on our table 8 of us enjoyed the food , the experience and the service"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and i usually go to Korean grill house on hwy 7, but there was a 45 minute wait there tonight. Not being able to wait that long, we decided to give chako a try after ruling out some other restaurants - I'm glad we did. From the outside the place looks huge and modern, and that look continues inside. Its a hip restaurant that puts KGH to shame in terms of looks. In to the most important part, the food.....unlike KGH, Chako includes a variety of sushi in the all you can eat menu."}
{"text":"Got introduced to Korean BBQ cause of Chakos. The whole concept of cooking your food sounded fun and is good place to just talk and eat and for groups. From my experiences never dealt with sitting time or ordering limitations. 

Food - Your not getting some special aged Angus, free range chicken meat. At the same time, you are getting real good cuts. Every tray I received looks like what it's supposed to look like and tastes like what it's supposed to taste like. My friends usually stack up on the ribs, cooks the quickest and tastes great. The chicken can use a little more seasoning but there's always sriracha available, but cooking times can get annoying. The veggies are crisp and fresh no complaints there. In terms of seafood I would say the shrimp is the best. The sushi offerings are a nice addition but would say is on the average end. The mango ice cream .... :-) . Overall menu options are limited and depending on what time you go can get noticeably reduced. 

The Staff - Minimal communication hiccups here and there but end of the day you get what you ordered and the kitchen is usually on point even when it gets busy. 

Cooking the food properly is paramount. Getting an upset stomach from improperly cooked food is not fun... trust me. The burners can get dirty or low on flame power, but the staff can always swap the grills or increase the output.  

Overall Chakos is a nice place, would give it a 3.5/4 out of 5. Wouldn't really regard it as the best but it's still an enjoyable place."}
{"text":"\"Honey, where do you want to take the kids to dinner tonight?  I don't feel like cooking dinner...\" I asked my wife.
\"Hey let's go to Chako!  We haven't been there for a long time!\".
Great...on a night where I don't want to cook she wants us to go to a restaurant where we have to cook ourselves?!?!?  Go figure!!

Chako has been around a while as an all you can eat Korean BBQ joint in Scarborough.   It has your standard beef, fish and chicken cuts of meat, along with other items such as fish, shrimp and other seafood choices.  The beef ribs tend to be a standout of the items we ordered.  There is more selection on dinner and weekend dinner menus with the price adjusted accordingly.  

Its not really high quality cuts of meat but at this price point its reasonable for what you pay.  The good thing is that the marinated meats are lightly seasoned and not too salty like many AYCE joints.  They also have some simple sushi rolls with quality that is similar to what you find in the supermarket aisles in case you want something different.  The matcha and mango ice cream were really bad though and partially melted already when you get them.  

Service was really good as the servers are constantly walking around and quite pleasant which is always a bonus.  They charge 10% service charge but the servers emphasize you can tip more if you want.  I'm guessing since that 10% only goes directly to the management:(

Overall its okay, nothing great but does the job if you don't want to cook.....wait I mean if you don't want to do the dishes afterwards;)"}
{"text":"Disappointing experience:
Cons:
- Very expensive $23.99 (buffet on weekend). We ended up paying $70 for two people (drink and tea included) for bad food. And as I did not eat much I was hungry in an hour;
- The meat was not very good cut, not seasoned well, had bones and cartilage (yuck!);
- No spices on table (salt, pepper or other). Some salt would be great for salmon, veggies or other;
- Not many vegetarian options (very limited veggie options, only 2 vegetarian sushi!)
- The burners were not working properly couple of times but it was fixed later;
- Not enough ventilation, this place really stinks, so don't wear anything fancy and cute;
- 2 hours limit per table, so do not plan big parties here - cooking takes some time, especially when the meats are so big and thin, and if your burner does not work well;
- The service was not bad but we were brought things we did not order; and some dishes that we ordered never arrived (they say you have to pay $5 for dish that you ordered but did not use);
- Desserts were horrible. Menu said: ice cream, mango pudding, chocolate mousse, and they were all so tiny (I forgot to take picture of this joke) like a sample size... And the taste was even worst. I don't try their ice cream but none of us liked their mango pudding (very hard and bland) and chocolate mousse tasted like whipped cream with cocoa flavor, just frozen a bit.
I am giving 1 star because kids really enjoyed the food cooking in front of them. But as I do not \"own\" any kids, I won't be coming back. Most of my friends rated this place 4/10 and they usually like bbq.
Pros:
- Free parking
- Kids will enjoy it (they won't be bored while waiting for their meals)."}
{"text":"There is a hidden cost at the end of bill customer was charged extra $8-$9 for cleaning up barbecue pans. It seems very ridiculous customers have to pay for this fee, as cleaning up pans job shouldn't be an integral part of barbecue restaurant? For weekend lunch menu says $28, at the end we have to pay ((28*1.13tax)+9cleaning fee)*1.15tips=$45 it ended up very pricey compared with other sushi buffet restaurant cost average $25 per person. Won't go back again unless owner decide to get rid of this hidden cost. You can charge customers whatever you want but should mention on menu or build-in price tag."}
{"text":"Very very disappointing Korean BBQ place. For a place where customers cook for themselves, it is surprisingly low-quality. Probably my LEAST favourite Korean BBQ places."}
{"text":"The food is alright, it's a Korean BBQ place so the primary factor for me is the service. 

The staff here are extremely annoying, condescending and incredibly slow. I only go here because it is bigger than most other Kbbq places so a large group of friends can get a table without a reservation fairly easily. 

Decent food horrible service."}
{"text":"The service was horrible. I mean really really horrible. I gave 1 extra star just because these guys must be exhausted from shoveling raw meat at people all day. I'm sooooo full so I guess that counts as a close fail in my books. Like they say, close is only good in horseshoes and hand grenades."}
{"text":"It's not one of those high end korean bbq places where you pay a lot for quality meat, but you definitly get more than what you pay for. Highly recommend their dinner as it comes with more meat and dishes (sushi, rolls, desserts, etc). Wouldnt order sushi at a kbbq place though. 
Service was exceptional...never thought I would experience this kind of awesome service at a Chinese owned restaurant..until when I was paying the bill and found out that you tip a general percentage (10%) which is already included in the bill...and they also ask you to tip the individual server seperately. Not sure if they know, but tipping is not mandatory.... Shame that I actually like eating here."}
{"text":"Great place...I love the food and the atmosphere...they dont have the all you can eat sushi during the week which kind of sucks"}
{"text":"Food was merely okay. Worse than the other Chako at midland and finch. What triggered me was the service. We arrived at the door and the front desk was just serving the other three guests, so we waited. While we were waiting, the other two guys came in. Then the front desk went back and served them first. Then explained to me that she was looking at available tables. She looked \"available tables\" for 5 minutes. Another problem arose when we were trying to change the fried pan for bbq because it was not clean anymore. The waitress simply told me \"I will change it later. I can't change it now\", didn't even care to explain why. Compared to other Chakos in the GTA area, this one is the worst. I will never come back again."}
{"text":"all you can eat and fresh food. 
Workers are fast & it's a big restaurant. 
Korean BBQ try it . Don't cook if you don't want to they have food sushi. Nice place to bring family and friends. If there a line up which sucks, it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"First all, I am not complaining about the food. The food is great, but literally this is such a typical all-you-can-eat asian venue that you need to watch out.

The service blows at this place. We came in late at around 2:14pm and were told that the last call was at 2:30pm, so we ordered more because knowing that we won't be able to get more order. And by 3:00pm they are asking us to pay first. 

So we paid, and then they told us the leftover plates with meat are not eaten will be charged with $3 each. Great, they could have told us that before we order item.

And I swear to god that when she told us it is last call at 2:30pm, they still let another group of 8 people to come in to sit down at 3:00pm and then also told them that this is 'last call'. The other table of people are also panicked and then ordered more than they should and would eat.

Apparently the waitress had to charge the other table for 15 plates of leftover meat.  And we just wouldn't give up and we literally cooked every single leftover plate and sat till 4pm to finish most of them.

They could have just locked the door at 2:30pm and say that the lunch time is over. All of us are were told that we can only order 'once' for this 'all-you-can-eat' place. And guess what? everyone over ordered.

This is the 2nd time I've been here, this is actually the first time we over ordered, why? because we were told it's the 'last call'. And then they let another group to come in at 3pm and also tell them 'last call' at 3:00pm. The restaurant opens till 4pm, why they kept doing this 'last call' trick?

Such a typical all-you-can-eat venue that you won't be getting much of service. That is fine, we expected that, and yet this 'last call' trick is not gonna make me come back here ever again."}
{"text":"They were quick and took care of refilling our drinks etc... Without us even asking or noticing. Great service!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a weekday; we had a private room for a group of 9 people.  Located in a plaza, the restaurant is large, and as with most AYCE places, offers more selection on weekends.  In general, keep in mind that I am not a fan of any Korean bbq restaurant; I don't enjoy going to a restaurant to cook my own food and leave completely smelling like bbq smoke.  Nonetheless, the service was attentive despite our large group, and this location always seems to be busy.  I would recommend the Short Ribs and I love bbq pineapple."}
{"text":"Man service here is bad. Almost terrible considering they don't really cook anything. I'm not a self cooking at restaurant person as I don't like going out to cook for my self.  If I wanted to do that I would of stayed at home. 

There was 1.5 servers for about 8 tables. One main guy and 2 others id see every 20 mins or so.  

Food tasted decent but nothing wowed me. I would not go back."}
{"text":"Attentive service and decent food quality

We were there on a Sunday, so their weekend menu applies (special beef and lamb, both are just OK). Overall, the food quality is slight above average. I also live the kimchi and small side dishes.

The restaurant is spacious and very high ceiling. Don't feel smoky (but the clothes still absorb it. Oh well..

But the highlight is the service, they have very nice staff here the night I came. They come and check on is quite frequently, and never made me feel rushed and asking for too much.

I will come back if I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"Decent food. The typical Chinese run Korean AYCE restaurants. 

Pro -  after 10 cheap late night food."}
{"text":"First time trying this place and it was a decent experience. We were a group of 9 going for a weekend lunch and the place was not packed. We made a reservation just in case though! 

Food:
In the lunch menu you get beef, pork, ribs, calamari, chicken, and fish fillet as your meat choices. I found this pretty good because we were a bunch of teens with small stomachs. The meat was nicely marinated and I enjoyed cooking the food myself. 

Experience:
Fun spot to cook your own food without having to worry about burning the place down. 

Service:
The service was honestly really slow even though the restaurant was almost empty. Workers would check on our table once in a while and it was hard to get their attention. Disappointed my meal."}
{"text":"We called and made reservation for a party of 40. 
The service was great. We were served right away and got all our drink orders within matter of minutes. Throughout the meal, they monitored our tables and made sure we had enough. The food was yummy and we all left very satisfied."}
{"text":"An average Korean bbq restaurant. Decently priced. They serve sushi which most kbbq don't, but their sushi isn't the best. However, I can find better Korean bbq in Toronto with the price I paid for.

I think they have ventilation problems... I came out of the restaurant smelling like a bbq meat. I've never experienced this in other Korean bbq places."}
{"text":"Neat place.  First time in a Korean BBQ where you order your protein or seafood, veggies and cook it yourself.  

The portions you order is not as stated.  As sometimes they bring soooo much of a dish and other times only a couple of pieces.

You can also order limited  sushi rolls here.  I am assuming its from their joining restaurant; Wasabi.

They have rows and everyone sits beside each other.  A table top stove for every seating of 4.
Its good if your new... other diners are more than happy to guide you through your first experience."}
{"text":"Wow!  Great food, good service and overall a very nice experience.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Not bad, much better than the other korean all you can eat bbq.  The food wasn't the best tasting and selection was very limited.  On our visit, the service was pretty good, lots of waiters walking around, cleaning our plates and pouring more water into the stove.  Of course i hated the mandatory tip.  But 10% for decent service is fine to me.  I've tried other korean bbq, and you can eat yourself poor pretty quickly, for volume this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Was feeling some Korean BBQ. Resto was decorated nicely and service was average. 
Food was okay, came out promptly. Good variety is decent. 

Overall filled with the meat and rice."}
{"text":"I had a great first experience here with my friends for lunch. They advertise smokeless BBQ (written in Chinese) at their storefront, although I see no difference from a regular BBQ place, you're still going to get that smokey smell all over your hair and clothes. That aside the food was great, and our waitor was very nice and efficient. He took away our plates as soon as their were empty and always came back to top up our tea. Meat quality is decent and marinated well. I have no complaints, even though I've had better meat quality at other Korean BBQ places. On the weekends they have a 2hr seating limit policy, but when I went on a Saturday with a large group, we stayed past the two hours and they did not rush us."}
{"text":"Went here this evening for my brothers birthday and the service was terrible. We arrived at 3:30 when \"lunch\" just finished and we had to wait 45 mins for \"dinner to begin\". Although we called ahead of time and asked if a reservation was necessary etc. Our first server kept forgetting our order and took forever just to bring drinks. Once his shift was over and we got a new server the service was much better. I would highly recommend the short ribs, calamari, chicken and lamb. I wouldn't order the shrimps again as they aren't seasoned so there isn't much flavour. However it was a great experience to be able to BBQ your own food. The sushi is also pretty good."}
{"text":"My nursing friends and I come here everytime we get drained from studying at school. We come here at around 10 or 11 pm and these is a great AYCE because they close at midnight (but the last call for customers to come in is at 11pm). 

The dinner menu has a lot to offer. My favourites are the ff: short ribs, BEAN SPROUTS, chicken, radish, tofu, sweet fried you, beef, and steamed rice. I always try to order this to replenish my hungry tummy and get ready for another month of hibernating from Chako.

i always forget to order their california rolls (I tried it once on Sept 2011) but I think it is included in their dinner menu too. The maki with mango sauce was sweet and it was kay for me. My friends loved it but it was a blah for me cause i dont like mango in my entrees. 

The servers are very prompt and they act very quick. I am just scared sometimes when we eat here at night because there was one night when some Jerseyshore- ISH guys with spiky gel-ed hair were eating and they were picking up a fight with one of the servers. 

The dinner price would be around 25 dollars which is a bit normal for most of the AYCE restaurants.

i just hate it when I get out of the place because i smell burnt just like the grills we use for cooking inside Chako.

I would definitely come back here again and order the same old entrees I usually order + the japanese rolls :)"}
{"text":"Good food, pretty pricey! Just keep bringing the short ribs, those are well seasoned and marinated! We went for lunch, it cost about $40 for two people with one pop. Great staff that comes by every couple of minutes in case you need something."}
{"text":"The prices have climbed a lot and its really just not worth it anymore. 

I came in here with my girlfriend on a Saturday. The place was busy, but it was definitely not at capacity. Even though I saw free seats, we were told to wait. We ended up waiting more than 20 minutes before we were finally told we can sit down. By the time we got a seat, we only had one chance to get everything we wanted because it was already last call. Was this the plan? 

Look, I enjoy the food. The sliced beef is great, the ribs are awesome, but combined with the usual customer service (lousy) and the prices, its just not worth it in my opinion. It came out to more than $17pp for lunchtime. I could go eat an amazing lunch elsewhere for this much money and be just as full. Not to mention, they have a well documented history with DineSafe. The ever increasing prices are just not justifiable anymore."}
{"text":"You know when you go to a AYCE Korean BBQ there can be some issue with quality and freshness but there isn't here. The food is fresh and even if it feels like they are always missing some stuff 'cause you order way too much I had a lot of fun, The service was OK, as I had to get almost too noisy to get some of out super busy waiters to get rice. Instead of asking who needed more rice he just said yes,went to get the rice and somebody else at the table then proceed to ask him for more but he was already gone. 
In his defense, the place was super packed but if the place is always that packed they should get more staff to increase the quality of the service.  Overall we didn't wait much to get our first order, the food was good."}
{"text":"All you can eat meat. It was really good. Loved the short ribs and chicken. The mango ice cream is sooo awesome"}
{"text":"When you first enter the area during dinner time, you can smell the BBQ from a mile away. The place is always packed so it might be a few minutes before you can find seating, especially if you have a large group. We started our order with one of everything which was a good decision. Their beef is amazing, chicken is not too far behind. Sushi, while being basic, still is a great treat. 

I just wish I could remember which sauce is the red and which is the green."}
{"text":"We were looking for something different to do for our anniversary. So we decided on Chako.

Some observations:
The restaurant is showing its age from when it was Wasabi. Going down the stone steps, they are all cracked and need repair. You also get walked through what has become a bussing area with food carts and leftover dishes. A little finesse with the look would go a long way.

We were seated at a more private table, which was nice. But I could see it was still dirty from past users. Was it the lunch rush, was it last night? I'm not sure and I don't want to know. 

The meat came out quickly and all tasted just fine. The short ribs were a bit chewier than normal and I had a \"omg, I'm choking\" moment. Sushi had a strange taste to it. Like old cucumbers. 

The banchan were not too bad. I got the kim chi which was sweeter and less pungent than normal. I liked it. The radish was also good. 

Strange aspects would be sauces served in plastic with white plastic spoons. Ice cream served in weird foam containers? 

It seemed all set up to do as little as possible as obviously servers are busily shuttling meat back and forth. I get it. But still, looks weird. 

And yes, there was a mandatory 10% gratuity added on. Which was explained by our server. I don't agree with this at all, but paid it knowing we won't be going back again."}
{"text":"The food quality used to be good. Now it's just so bad. Everything here is not fresh at all. It seems food that they serve here has been sitting here at least a week old. It tasted weird. I gave this place two stars only because I think the service was okie."}
{"text":"Upon arrival....this place is busy!!! We had a 45 min wait but it's all good! Great service and our waiters were here attentive to our needs. We (group of 3) had various meats (chicken, beef, lamb, shrimp) - all seasoned to profection. The moose, chocolate & vanilla icecream was a nice touch to end the dinner service. Anyway don't take my word for it...try it for yourself! Only two negative points 1) you smell like a walking BBQ after your visit & 2) we had the BABY with us & was charged $3 for her eating. I immediately asked them to take it off as she can't eat solids (look over your bill before paying)!!! Bill corrected, it's all good!"}
{"text":"Sometimes I just want to get hooched up, go out and pretend that my life is an episode of \"K-Town\" (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9uzg2-ccac).  

I did a quick search for Korean food in Mississauga and Chako came up.  There were many reviews for the Scarborough and Richmond Hill locations so I figured we'd give the West side location a try.

There were some early indicators that this meal would probably be a fail - restaurant is attached to a Wasabi buffet, Chako dining room was huge and completely empty yet were ushered into a side room and sat at long communal tables with barely enough elbow room between couples, and it took 20 minutes and several arm waving gestures before any waitstaff came over to take a drink/food order.

We filled out our menu cards and waited for the parade of meats to arrive.  First came the side dishes - kimchee, turnip, bean sprouts, seaweed salad, and fried tofu.  I also ordered a miso soup and a salad.  Then came the veggies - mushrooms, red/green peppers, zucchini, and pineapple.  Finally, the meats - beef, ribs, pork, lamb, chicken, ox tongue, shrimps, calamari, salmon, fish fillet (not sure what kind but it was white), and mussels.  We threw a bit of everything on the grill and watched it sizzle and cook.  Then it dawned on me...I'm such a sucker, as if I'm not already sick of cooking for myself and also if the food was bad, I'd have no one to blame by myself.

The meats were okay, not high quality by any means.  The ribs were thick and fatty.  The shrimps still had a head and shell which were a bit of a pain to eat.  The white fish had a mysteriously Javex-y taste.  The calamari was good but not properly cleaned - still had a skin on it.  The pineapple sounded appetizing but ended up being unripe and uncored hunks.  

Service was one of the main issues with the meal.  There were about 5 servers waiting on roughly 40-50 people in the room.  They looked so sweaty and overwhelmed.  Sure, I'm no stranger to bad service at Asian places but I have to say that it's been awhile where servers purposely avoided our gaze just so they wouldn't have to refill our water glasses or bring us a few more food items.  The servers just looked miserable, probably wanting to fall face first onto a hot burning BBQ plate just to get out of work.

The saddest part of the meal was dessert.  The mango ice cream came in small golf ball sized servings (What is this - Ice cream for ants?).  The mango pudding was even sadder...it was three squares of gelatinous cubes, more like jello with no evaporated milk.  And the seasonal fruits?  It was a bowl of chopped up bits of unripe cantaloupe and honeydew melon.

Not a great or memorable meal but we did leave coated in a hot new scent called Eau de BBQ."}
{"text":"We went on the weekend, so it was extremely packed, wait time was about 20 minutes for dinner. 

The stuffs were friendly; the beef and ribs were really great and fresh, but the chicken leaves you feeling a fatty after taste which is similar to Korean grill house's. 

We would go back just for the beef and ribs actually . Overall a not so bad experience."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant. Food is good . The meat well marinated and the kids always enjoy cooking their own food"}
{"text":"Average for the prices.
18.99 on Wednesdays.
Service is well up to par with the rush of AYCE.
The food is well marinated & thick (unlike Korean Grill House where the beef breaks apart if you handle it too roughly)
Just watch out at the end - the server will already have put in a 10% service charge so don't tip again! (unless you're one of those)"}
{"text":"Just your typical and mediocre KBBQ place - I prefer the Richmond Hill location but this is the closest to my house. They used to do late night buffet a few years back which was really convenient for any late night cravings. Bummy that they don't offer it anymore.

Service was ok - we were still missing a few items and had to ask 2-3 times from 2 different servers to get the same item that was missed. It wasn't TOO busy either, but it was so difficult to flag down the servers for more food orders and refills. 

Ice cream options suck as the flavours are seasonal - only vanilla and chocolate when I went. NO GREEN TEA THOUGH? SO sad.

The bill is what confused me ....When I got the bill our server told us that there was already gratuity added on it, and that this gratuity is just for the restaurant. Any tip that we'd give on top of that will be for our servers.. I've never been a restaurant that automatically adds tip for a table of 2 (it was literally just my boyfriend & I) - so either the server scammed us or Chakos needs to fix this LOL! Anyway, I didn't want to put up a fight so I tipped another 10% so my bill ended up being $80 for 2 people.... Ouch. I think Im just going to stick to Arirang from now on for any KBBQ cravings I have."}
{"text":"Came here for my friends birthday. Good food like any standard Korean BBQ. The fish tasted odd and fell apart. the pineapple was not ripe. i also wish my servers didn't look like they hated their life. I'd go back. They just opened up I'm sure they will improve. The other locations are cheaper"}
{"text":"Visited this location on the weekend for the first time and boy do they get packed. We were super hungry and it was super late so we decided to wait 45 minutes. It was worth the wait because we left stuffed. As soon as we sat down we were ready to order and the food came flying out quickly. For anyone who hasn't been it's a cool experience to grill the meat to your liking and the food was seasoned well (it would be nice to have two seasoning options for the chicken).  Don't skip dessert the mango ice cream is creamy and delicious!"}
{"text":"a decent place for kbbq. give chako a try if you haven't tried it (also offers some sushi)
**if you go late night dining it's better to make RSVP or you could set yourself up for a 20-30 minute wait**"}
{"text":"Had a great meal, in fact couldn't finish everything that was brought on the first round.  It was refreshing to see that the waiter was happy to bring lots and told us that if we don't finish, don't worry about it.

There is a surprising amount of items included in the AYCE price, unlike some places where it's 3-4 meats, rice, and banchan.

I will echo the concerns mentioned by other reviewers regarding tipping/service charge.  Our waiter did mention that the 10% service charge is shared by everybody but tips left were only for him.  The service was actually pretty good so I did leave an additional tip but this seems like kind of a shady way to do business."}
{"text":"Went to this place with a large group of 7-8 people. It was a very tight fit since we had like mainly guys on our table. The waiter was very patient since it was a lot of people's first time trying this. We ordered a selection of meat, sushi, seafood, veggie, almost everything on the menu. 

After everything came, I regretted ordering fish and veggies. I've never been to a Korean BBQ place where we grilled veggies before and I've been to a lot of Korean BBQ places. This place was interesting and I guess I'm a bit picky on food but it fell short of the KBBQ experience. I was a bit disappointed in how fast the grill turned black and we had to change it multiple times. This happened because the waiter kept on turning the heat to blazing hot and there wasn't enough fat in the meat to act as oil. 

Anyways props to the waiter for handling the table since we ordered and had a lot of questions."}
{"text":"just want to get this out of the way. i absolutely HATE korean bbq, but i'll try to be as unbiased about this as i can. I just don't like the idea of paying to cool my own food. paying $30 at that. the only reason i came was because it was a friends birthday.

how many people can even eat close to $30 worth of food at a kbbq place? it's so expensive. all you're doing at the end of the day, is throwing pre-marinated meat onto a grill. i'd really rather go spend my $30 at a nice restaurant and get a nice rare steak. often times, you're either over/under cooking certain meats and sometimes burning them cus you forget while in conversation with your group.

the only things i actually enjoyed eating were the beef ribs and pineapple. speaking of pineapple, Brazilian steak house would be even better. WAY better.

however, obviously, people do for some reason like korean bbq. so there must be some sort of appeal to it, and if you like it, then maybe you'll like this. or if you haven't tried kbbq. maybe this is a not so bad place to try it.

verdict: i really don't know why people are willing to pay $30 to cook their own food.

I really hate to do this. because i always want to give places a chance. but this will have to be my first 1 star review. sorry."}
{"text":"Ordered:
Ayce


Expectation:
Good quality meat

Reality:
Depending on your server you will have different experiences.(been coming here since it opened)
 Food has always been solid. From their appetizers (fried tofu is my personal fav) to their meat selection (short ribs are the best here) all the way to the sushi bar (not much, but their spicy salmon rolls are good; not spicy but still good). Great service at times but make sure you get a reservation on Friday-Sundays, if not you are looking for at least a 30 min wait."}
{"text":"Tonight my bf and I enjoyed our first Korean BBQ experience at Chako.  We were quickly seated and our host explained everything to us and made some recommendations.

The meats were perfectly seasoned and arrived promptly at our table - the host even came and offered to change the grill for us (this being our first time, I didn't know you could do that!)

The only reason for the four stars is the following:

-We ordered the specialty beef (only available on weekends) and it came as a full steak.  I had to ask for a knife and fork to be able to cut it and with the dishes (plate and portion for soya sauce), it was kind of difficult.  I recommend cutting the steak into pieces.

-The beef and pork were very thinly sliced and while very well seasoned, they weren't cut all the way through so we had giant pieces that balled up and cooked VERY quickly.  I would suggest cutting the meat a little thicker.

-The peppers received may stand to be cut into wedges rather than \"circles\", it made it a little difficult to eat without the knife and fork.

-PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE change the shrimp to a pealed, headless shrimp.  The shrimp head ended up exploding on my bf while he was trying to peel it.  

Other than those 4 things, the experience was great and we will totally return!"}
{"text":"Chako is decent for what it offers in the suburbs. Dinner includes sushi for order as well as the AYCE grilling. Go for lunch or after 10pm when they offer the cheap late night pricing if you're not willing to pay over 20 for the meal. Drinks are not included in the pricing.

The meats are pretty much marinated in the same sauce. It's flavourful but they all taste the same. Vegetables include zucchini and peppers which aren't seasoned. Pineapple was available for grilling as well - these weren't ripe at all. The seafood is sometimes okay but they tend to be quite fishy in taste so I don't really recommend them. Side dishes are included as well - kimchi, pickled radishes, bean sprouts, etc. They're pretty good and help balance the primarily meat filled meal. Sushi selection is very limited so don't expect AYCE sushi selection. The rolls are comparable to most AYCE sushi rolls - too much rice, not enough content.

It's not a bad place but it's not great. Decent if you're looking for grilled meats and not wanting to travel too far. Nice decor. I found the service to be pretty good but maybe I just got lucky judging from the other reviews."}
{"text":"All you can eat KBBQ for 17.99 on a weeknight include:
- meats: beef (meh)/chicken(no good)/pork (good)/ribs (very good)/ox tonue (DELICIOUS)
- vegetables: pineapple/zucchini/red pepper
- side dishes: kimchi (surprisingly very good)/tofu/beansprout
- seafood: squid/shrimp/fish/mussels
- sushi: four types of rolls, none of which are any good
- steamed rice
- dessert: green tea and mango ice cream

not included:
- drinks
- service (yeah, the service is slow and like someone else said, \"blows\")

Honestly though, the food is really good, and since you cook your own food, nothing else really matters too much, especially when the place is really spacious, clean, and well-decorated.

I think it's 18.99 on weekends, and they offer more food on the menu.

I would love to come back and leave smelling like delicious bbq'ed meat."}
{"text":"I did not really enjoy my experience here. A lot of my friends would rave about this place so I decided to try it out and was defintely disappointed. The beef ribs were too thick, the seaweed was stale and other things weren't so great. The place has a nice atmosphere but not the food."}
{"text":"only 1 word comes to mind for this place.....yummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmy!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has decent customer service but like all the other chakos it offers the same great food.
It gets very busy evenings and weekends.
If you decide to go lunch and late night is when the prices are a bit more reasonable!"}
{"text":"We've been going to this restaurant for years now. The food and service has always been consistent. I know that there are a lot of korean bbq restaurants in Toronto, and Chako is one restaurant that I can count to be consistent.

Tonight we were seated at one of the VIP rooms, which was a first for me.  It had that cozy feel to it.  And our server was very attentive and friendly.  She made sure that the kept on coming. We didnt have to wait a long to our refills of meat, seafood, and vegies.

Overall Chako is a great korean bbq restaurant.  Try it out sometime, you wont regret it, i havent for years!"}
{"text":"We were seated promptly, despite it being a long weekend. Good service was decent. Sometimes it took a while to flag someone down, but once the order was placed, food arrived in a short time. Most of us mostly enjoyed the need ribs and sliced beef. They have a small sushi selection that is included in the price which is a nice addition. You may want to make reservations on weekends!"}
{"text":"My cousin took me here, advertising it as amazing Korean barbecue, and some of the best in the GTA.  A disclaimer, as you can see from my review history: I'm a huge snob about my Korean food.  Living in Los Angeles has given me a good palate for kbbq-- even the slightly sketchy all-you-can-eat kind.  

So, keeping that in mind, the food here is fine by Toronto standards, but it wouldn't survive ten minutes in LA.  The chicken, pork and beef bulgogi all tasted like they had marinated it in the same sauce, and that sauce had no real heat or flair to it-- only a kind of boring, flat sweetness, not unlike barbecue sauce.  The same goes for the banchan.  The kimchi was under-fermented, and the other side dishes were clearly phoned in.

Come on, Toronto, you're a major metropolitan area.  You can do better than this."}
{"text":"Been here more than 2 times now, because it's the closest one in town.  We regularly go to Korean grill house in Markham but the traveling will cost me a lot in gas so we go to this one.  The buffet is not bad except the Kalbi short ribs are a little bit tastier at Korean grill house.  You get all the same sides like kimchi, tofu etc...overall it's not a bad Korean bbq place that is conveniently close by."}
{"text":"I went here a couple of times, and I always thought Chako was just average and nothing special.

The meats are very thick, so it takes a while for it to cook properly, which is a downside. However, the prices were okay, and I liked how big and spacious the restaurant is (compared to how cramped up other Korean BBQ places are).

The only thing that I really enjoy is the mango ice cream for dessert HAHA but mango ice cream is all the same everywhere!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely great for a group of 6 or more, you really do get to enjoy different types of meat without being overly full. 
We did happen to go with a group of 6 for dinner on a Saturday night. It's a good idea to make reservations so you aren't waiting as it was pretty crowded. 
The meat is your standard fare but a tad more choices than the Korean grill house. The one thing that I was really craving that wasn't on the menu was the poem belly. They are connected to wasabi so the sushi is relatively good as well (for and AYCE place) 
I don't generally expect much in terms of desert from any Korean restaurant so it's a plus just having desert available. They had a mediocre variety of vanilla and chocolate ice cream, a mango jelly like substance in a small cup and a piping amount of chocolate mouse. Don't go expecting to really like the desert. I still do absolutely recommend the food. 

Bill: here's the part I didn't like too much - I didn't mind that it cost 51.98 for 2 people (we all had them split the bill), however, they charge HST and a 10% service charge AFTER HST is applied. Now here is where it gets even worse.... the waitress explained that 8% is for the manager and 2% is distributed by staff. Anything we choose to tip over that is what she gets to keep. 

Bear in mind that the credit card machine is programmed to calculate the tip on top of the total amount so a $51.98 bill ended up turning into $71.12 after taxes and tips. 

This place had a 4 star for the food but I had to take a star off for bad billing practices. The manager certainly didn't do anything to deserve the 8%"}
{"text":"Food is ok but the service is terrible. The manager totally ignores us whenever we asked for service and the staff are very bad tempered."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and from those two experiences I say dinner service is much better in terms of selection for meats and seafood compared to lunch time. Wish they had more selection for vegetables too. 

Service is quick and attentive. 

DO NOT ORDER SUSHI. Ordered a cucumber roll one time, poor presention and the \"cucumber\" was pretty much just the skin of the cucumber. 

All on all average place for bbq. Would probably go again if I'm hankering for some meat."}
{"text":"I reserved a table for 6 adults and 1 child. The server were able to lead us to our table fairly quickly when we arrived at the place. The waiter and waitress were also very friendly to my little brother. 

They were also able to attend to our orders very quickly. The place was spacious and very clean, but it's really dim, which is something I personally do not.

The meat was cut into thick slices which makes it longer to cook. 

At the end of your meal, they give you warm moist towelettes, which was really nice.

I enjoyed their green tea ice cream the most."}
{"text":"Worst service with average food quality even for AYCE Korean BBQ. Hostess staff are clowns and horribly organized - enforcing on the spot policies that other locations do not have and failing to carry them out consistently throughout the night. Hostess claimed restaurant was \"too busy\" and thus could not seat people when there were 4 rooms empty right at the front unreserved. 

Stay clear of this location. 

P.S. if your going to include a 10% service charge on the bill automatically to every customer, at least ensure that the service is within reasonable standards."}
{"text":"2-1/2 STARS.

There is nothing authentic about this restaurant (not run by Koreans or Japanese), but for all you can eat it was a good value.
The restaurant is nicely laid out and the individual bathrooms are cool.

For some reason the selection of meats and seafood we received wasn't really marinated too well and tasted very bland after grilling, so we relied on dipping the meats in soy and chili sauces.

Avoid the sushi. This is not a sushi restaurant and the rolls they had there were poorly made, the fish wasn't that fresh (most of the rolls offered were vegitarian, probably for a reason) and didn't taste that great.

The Korean side dishes were decent.

The built-in table grills needed to be cleaned or replaced a few times during the meal, which would have been okay but service here is painfully slow especially if you are in one of the private rooms where they can't really see you -- it was awkward having to leave the room to fetch a server everytime we need something.

Desserts were very disappointing and not a great way to end a meal. They were served in small plastic bowls with plastic spoons which was very ghetto (almost like hospital or school cafeteria food). The mango ice cream was more like cheap orange creamsicle in a cup and the mousse/pudding was more like jello.

You will be walking out smelling of BBQ smoke so be sure not to wear anything too nice, and place does get extremely busy after 8pm, so be sure to get there 6 or 7-ish if you don't want to be waiting for a table."}
{"text":"Decent Korean bbq run by Chinese staff. The short ribs were my favourite- flavoured very well. The pork was my least favourite- really fatty pieces. Overall, decent value for AYCE lunch at $13.99/pp on weekends. Drinks are extra $. Good service. The menu for lunch is quite limited, so I'll have to come back to see if the dinner menu is better to really judge the quality of this resto."}
{"text":"I guess this place got a lot of complaints about their horrible service because the service we got was EXCELLENT.. I went for lunch with me family and we had 10 people.. We must have asked for more food every 10 minutes and it came promptly every time.. And on top of that the manager (or someone of high authority) came around at the end to make sure everything was good.. He even cracked a joke which was lame but nice of him..  The food was really really good.. The short ribs were the best I've ever had because they were cut so thick! 

The downfalls, the bean spouts (usually one of my fave sides) was disgusting.. We all had one bite and it was gross.. They used a plastic water can while cleaning the grill.. Kinda weird.. Lastly CHECK YOUR BILL!!!!!!!!! TIP IS INCLUDED!!!!!!!!!  Although they were nice about giving us the money back"}
{"text":"Love coming here for the ribs and mango ice cream! Both of these are to die for. The staff are nice, however some of them can be a bit rude/confusing and not doing the right thing (e.g. rushing you/taking your food away before it's done.. happened to my friend), overall it's a good place to go eat. Make sure you order the ribs (the best to cook) and for dessert get the mango ice cream!

P.S. when you go during dinner or weekends, they have sushi! The spicy salmon is amazing. Ask for spicy mayo with the sushi."}
{"text":"The food was quite average but the mandatory gratuity charges were so absurd! Its 10% and 9% of it goes to the host, manager and sushi bar chef. That made no sense because I barely spent 2 minutes with the host and ordered just a side of roll. 
I was appalled to pay these when I rather pay my server! 
Clearly never coming back"}
{"text":"I would like to 5 star but I'm not sure.  

I ordered rice but the rice they give to us it seem not new. The rice have no good smell to it. If you eat rice every day and 3 time a day you will know if the rice is new or very old. 

But anything else other then rice it was okay. Is not much sauce they offer, I believe just light soya and regular soya. 

I'm not sure how we can enjoy the food without any sauce or seasoning."}
{"text":"EVERY TIME I come here I realize why I tell myself I DO NOT WANT TO COME BACK HERE. I'M WRITING THIS IN CAPITAL LETTERS TO REMIND MYSELF NOT TO RETURN EVEN THOUGH I PROBABLY WILL. 

The SERVICE IS HORRENDOUS. I don't know if the turn over rate is high and they don't have time to retrain staff.. But let's be serious.. When I'm finished eating and my grill is still running.. 15 minutes after.. Because, where is my server? I DO NOT KNOW. Blazing heat.. RIGHT INTO MY FACE. Oh don't worry, I'm just going to sit here and work on my tan. 

The grade of meat is low, don't expect much. 

Basically, if you feel like bbqing because your barbecue at home ran out of gas and you don't feel like changing the tank.. Be my guest. (Yes, that is what happened.)"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time not to long ago. I love KBBQ in general and chako gives it all 
Service is alright but it's not bad 
Would definitely come again though."}
{"text":"Very interesting and fun experience cooking your own food, and everything was seasoned and marinated SO AMAZINGLY!  The sushi was well prepared, and staff was hard at work, very friendly also.  As meats go (for cooking), the best ones were the pork, beef, and short ribs!  I could've went without the shrimp and chicken.  Overall, a delightful place."}
{"text":"Always have a great experience whenever I go here. Today I went for lunch and the sushi was not included but if we paid an extra $10 the sushi would also be included in all you can eat. We wanted to order salmon but there was no salmon so we just ordered the fish that was offered. We asked for 8 originally and then asked for 6 instead because 8 would be too many. When it arrived, she waitress gave us 8 trays of fish. Halfway into the meal, we told her she gave us too many fish trays and she took it back no problem without question. Usually at other AYCE restaurants the waitresses will convince you it was your mistake an you ordered too many, but that wasn't the case. I was glad she took it without question. The waitress served us happily and very quickly.  Some things took longer than others, like the rice, but I think it's because they had to cook more. At the end of the meal, the waitress handed us a whole tray of Styrofoam cups with chocolate  and vanilla ice cream. We didn't even need to ask her for the dessert.  We all had separate bills and there was no issues. I really liked our server. She was happy the whole time while serving us. She was fast, efficient, and just so kind.  I wish all servers were like her.  

 Food was worth the price and definitely worth the service you get. They always want you to have more and they don't question you when you're ordering a lot. They always make sure you have enough food and of you want any more."}
{"text":"This is my 4th time coming but I don't think I'll ever come back again. The good is that the food is above average. It's seasoned well but definitely loaded with MSG and sodium so be careful. The sushi for dinner time is like your grocery store sushi nothing to rave about at all but fun to have at the Korean BBQ place. Two things that were really bad was:

1. Horrible horrible ventilation to the point where the smoke was burning my eyes. The Korean Grill House downtown is smaller and more congested and doesn't even have the problem. It makes it difficult to enjoy the meal and I usually don't mind that much smoke. 

2. The biggest thing I had a problem was with the TIP situation. They add on 12% automatically to your bill no matter the party size and the our waiter pushed us to tip more and when we didn't tip the amount he wanted he asked us why and put one of our friends on the spot which was unprofessional and awkward. He kept asking why?not good service? Not good food? What's wrong with us?? He said the 12% only goes to front of the house and the kitchen and less than 1% for himself. If this is the truth then this place needs to be reported to the labour authorities of Ontario because that's not right. I will never come back here because this is shady business etiquette and I don't respect that at all and I'll be telling others that ever mention this place. I don't blame the waiter I blame the restaurant owners. How disgusting."}
{"text":"Friendly greeters.   We were seated fast.  
Gave us a private room for our party of 12. They add a 12 percent tip in for parties.  
Pricey since kids are $20 for dinner ( even 5, 6 and 7 year olds).  
Loved the quality of meats and variety.
Beef ( 2 kinds), beef short ribs, lamb, chicken, white basa fish, salmon, shrimp, mussels, pineapples, Mushrooms, green peppers, ect
Dessert is limited to green tea ice cream, mango ice cream , mango pudding and one other pudding.  Sashimi, taco and sushi available too.  
Make sure you ask for extra thongs for hot n cold food.  They do change the grilling plate at your request.  Smoky smell is strong.  Staff are friendly and do nicely ask for added tips if you are happy with service and want to at your choice."}
{"text":"Meat, meat, and more meat. If you're all about the protein, then you should definitely hit up this joint! I came here with my friends, a group of big weight lifting guys... They definitely ate their money's worth and then some. I couldn't keep up!

Service could be better... As when you ask for a water refill or utensils, they don't seem like they enjoyed serving us.

We went for 5:30PM on a Sunday and it was pretty busy. The menu had a great number of meat choices such as short ribs, chicken, tiger shrimp, pork, beef, lamb, red peppers, pineapple, zucchini, and mushrooms. There were some more choices but we didn't have any of them. The meats were seasoned in a slightly spicy-sweet sauce. It was really good, but slightly got messy at times. The lamb confused me though at first because it didn't look like lamb since it was sliced super thin. It still tasted pretty good but didn't have a very distinct \"lamb\" taste.

I also ordered one California handroll, but received two. It wasn't the greatest and I would go to Chako for the BBQ portion.

We got some little mini desserts at the end as well. There was chocolate mousse, strawberry ice cream, and mango pudding. The mousse tasted like chocolate flavoured whipped cream and the mango pudding was okay but I definitely have had better.

It was worth it though in the end and I would definitely come back here for a post hardcore workout meal for all of the protein!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Chako for years now, and their prices are ridiculous, their late night special isn't even great anymore. I love going here for the short rib, sliced beef, and the tofu. Ordering sushi here is either a hit or miss, and the last time was definitely a miss. They charge 15% on the bill automatically, and whatever tip you choose to do goes to your server personally."}
{"text":"I go here every few months and the food is always very tasty, the service is usually quick. I went here for lunch today, and the food was good (sadly, my partner found a hair in their rice). Disappointed in my experience today, but usually the experience is above average."}
{"text":"This definitely one the best AYCE Korean BBQ places around! The decor is very modern with black marble tables and large booths with black leather couches. The place pretty spacious compared to most so you don't feel crowded or crammed into a corner and they have high ceilings which keeps the place less smokey.

What makes this place better than most is the selection of items they have on there menu. Not only do they include the traditional meats (beef, pork, chicken, short ribs, ox tongue) and seafood (tilapia, salmon, prawns) they also include mussels & calamari! All the meats were seasoned really well, my favorites are the beef, pork, and short ribs!

Plus it also your basic miso soup, salad, steamed white rice, kimichi (really good and spicy), fried tofu, bean sprouts but you also get fresh vegetables (red pepper, green pepper, zucchini and mushrooms) plus PINEAPPLE!

In addition to all of the above, the menu includes AYCE Sushi and Handrolls which are freshly made to order! We tried the Spicy Salmon Roll and California Roll both tasted good and fresh.

Then if your not stuffed after all that meat and sushi the menu includes dessert!
You can get mango and green tea ice cream!

The price is a little steeper than most however I never been to a KBBQ with this vast of a selection of items so I'd say it's definitely worth it! Service here is also really good there are many waiters constantly walking by and any of them of courteous enough to help you out. 

Ask to switch the grill out half way through as it does get pretty dirty after much grilling.

FYI washroom are unisex! Once you walk through the washroom door you enter a room several individual closed door washrooms lining both sides.

Definitely check this place out, it will blow your mind on what KBBQ has to offer!"}
