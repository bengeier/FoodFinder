{"text":"This is a Happy Hour Review

I like what Thomas has to say so I won't do a boring repeat but because of 2010 dollars and sh*&ty service, I can only give them three stars. There are just too many great options around Grayhawk, DC Ranch, Desert Ridge, etc that have happy hour specials.

Yeah yeah yeah you get what you pay for here and yeah maybe this place isn't for Happy Hour, but at least throw a special on a Tuesday night, guys. Also, when the number of staff = number of patrons, don't wait for us to come to the bar for a refill - check the sofa area now and then. 

Now, the prime rib sliders and corn chowder are so goddam kick-ass good that I have to give them at least three stars. We liked that you can order as many or as few sliders as you like so that is cool. They are almost a meal."}
{"text":"Perfect place after a round of golf at Grayhawk, or a business lunch. Service is always excellent, and great selection of beer. Menu selection and food never disappoints. Great atmosphere and one of my favorite places."}
{"text":"The food today was superb.  The service on the other hand...was not. I suggest the Navajo corn chowder and the soft pretzel bread. The cheese was ooy-gooy goodness.

Our server Amber was phenomenal. She came out with a very happy attitude and stayed positive throughout the entire meal. Amber gave us a pitcher of water so we wouldn't get thirsty.  Amber was the only server working at the time and there were 4 capable men unwilling to help us or get any orders right.  To top it off she filled our drinks as fast as we finished them.  ASK FOR AMBER AND YOU CAN'T GO WRONG.

Three members of my family had the prime rib sandwich and said that it was the best prime rib sandwich they had ever had.  The burger was great, and the chicken tenders where \"Yummy\" .  The fruit was very fresh and perfectly plated."}
{"text":"Lunch on Monday, slow service horrible oily meatball soup. Tasteless salad, chipped glasses

Two thumbs down"}
{"text":"There is never a bad evening at Phil's. They have great drink options, delicious food, and a beautiful view. They have live music on some nights, and it's always the perfect addition to the setting. The wait staff is courteous. I have never had a complaint about a meal at Phil's, and I've been there a lot."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! I love the nachos, the prime rib sliders, the club sandwich, and so much more! Every time I go I am greeted with amazing service and amazing food. Not to mention the fantastic ambience!!!"}
{"text":"3.5 Stars

Great view of the golf course, food was good and our server was excellent.  It was busy when we were there and it was quite loud with (mostly) foursome's of gentleman grabbing food and a beer after their round. TVs and leather chairs for sports watching as well. 

The only thing I didn't love was the spinach artichoke dip - my preference is a bit creamier. 

The chicken club wrap and wedge salad with shrimp were both very good."}
{"text":"Beautiful location to dine outside and enjoy the Spring weather.  Food ranges from sandwiches to steaks and many great salads.  Our server Chelsea was attentive and friendly.  They do have heaters for those who find it a tad cool.  Our large group enjoyed our evening and will be back."}
{"text":"This is in the Grayhawk Clubhouse (not to be confused with Quill Creek which you have to walk through to get to Phil's). Phil's is more bar-esque but very much so country club feel still. Named for the great local golf hero Phil Mickelson. 

The food and service is always great. I believe our servers name yesterday was Sarah, very friendly and right amount of attentive. We had a meeting and we're sitting there for a while. Free WiFi, no password required. 

The filet mignon salad is delicious mmm I love it! Pieces of very tender filet, chopped mixed greens (not the cheap kind) and excellent blend of flavors. 

Outside seating during the 'winter' is fantastic, views of the golf course, man-made lake and the mountain range in the back."}
{"text":"I have loved Phil's Grill for years but the last few times have been so so. The service is very slow when you sit on the patio.  I also recommend staying away from the tacos."}
{"text":"This update is only because our favorite servers / bartenders have changed. Scotty is a top-notch server, as is the lovely Sam! \"Salt n pepper Scott\" rocks behind the bar, as does our beloved Scotty, for that matter - like Manhattans? Ask for Scotty! I do wish the menu would change a bit, but we come here so often, the lack of variety is kind of our own fault. Scotty DOES know!"}
{"text":"Had dinner tonight at Phil's Grill at Grayhawk. Have eaten there before and it was hood but just forgot about how GOOD the food is, had the prime rib sandwich which was one of the best Ones I have ever had !! Wife had the chicken wrap which was also very tasty.. Prices are on par with similar eateries in the area, the prime rib melts in your mouth juicy. Beautiful patio at sunset & great service makes for a memorable occasion. Will be returning soon."}
{"text":"We enjoy dining at Phil's Grill at least once a week. The servers are very nice and try to please. The food is very good and you get a lot of it. Dine outside and you will be rewarded with a wonderful view and the smell of an open fire. Highly recommend Phil's for a great place to dine at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I have been a regular customer for Phils grill and the Quill Creek Caf√© for probably over 15 years... I absolutely love their salads, their soups, their burgers and they have a good selection of beer and wine... I even love the summertime when I do the Penguin club, you get the discounted Golf and you get free lunch in one of the restaurants so it's great! Brian one of the GM's of the food service is really really great and a lot of the workers like Scotty and Sam are great as well! Love Phils grill!"}
{"text":"We went for lunch to watch Phil during the 2015 Masters. The food and service was excellent. Everyone was very attentive to our needs. We had a wonderful time."}
{"text":"Lindsey and Karen very friendly, warm fun place to eat"}
{"text":"This is a very pleasant grill room that serves mostly the golfers who play Grayhawk's great courses.  But it is also a good spot to down some cold ones or have lunch as I did recently.  Good menu and good food.  Nice bar.  The obligatory video screens are tuned to the Golf Channel, of course."}
{"text":"Fantastic night at Phil's Grill. We had 16 of us celebrating my dad's 75th. The whole service staff was fantastic. Manager Austin helped make everything perfect helping with everyone on every detail. Perfection."}
{"text":"Ahhh...the lingering country club lunches at Phil's Grill. Those were the days. When I lived in the white, homogenized and frankly, boring, world called DCRanch, I often met up with my roomie at Phil's. Sort of the anti Zipp's sports bar. Of course there are the obligatory plasma tvs. The views of the course are great as you nestle into a comfie sofa . I felt like the old farts in the movie Trading Places. We'd sit in those big leather chairs by the fireplace and count our money. Once, I counted $27 in one pocket alone! The food here is fantastic, as it should be for a mogul like myself. Favorites include the Sonoran chicken pasta with fresh grilled corn, the prime rib slider (how old  money is that?!) and the Southwestern wrap. The menu does include high end steaks running up to $37 or so. I would have ordered that. But was unable to find another $10 in my other pockets."}
