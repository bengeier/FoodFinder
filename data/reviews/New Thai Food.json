{"text":"The large tom yum soup was the perfect meal on a cold, rainy, dreary night. Thanks to Vivek and Melanie C for their reviews! It was a huge bowl of noodles, broccoli, carrot slices, soft tofu, shoots and spicy delicous flavour toppings.It is very spicy, and as Vivek points out, it will definitely clear your sinuses.   The atmosphere of the Grange and the rest of the food in the warming trays weren't that appealing, but it's a good, cheap place to eat if you're on the go. Staff were very sweet and friendly."}
{"text":"I like how you can get lunch for under $5 here at New Thai Food. I've been on a quest to dine for $4.99, like how you used to be able to find back in the day. At New Thai I found that if you get the small size then it comes to $4.75 with tax. Woo hoo! Sure, you'll be hungry again in two hours, but at the time I was quite full and satisfied. I got the Thai BBQ style chicken and I really liked it. It came with coconut rice and mango salad, plus pickled shredded carrot. It was totally take-out food court, but still yummy!"}
{"text":"Best hot and sour soup I have ever had!  (And I've been to many Chinese restaurants.)  The Pad Thai is prepared when ordered, so it's very fresh.  Spring rolls and cold rolls are also very fresh and delicious.    The best part is the price.  Very affordable.  (My soup cost a whole $1.50!)  The lady who is always there is very friendly and it's obvious she's an expert in the kitchen.  Even though she prepares the food when you order it, it doesn't take long at all.    New Thai Food is part of the food court across the street from OCAD.  The food court is also attached to apartments so the crowd in the seating area is a mixture of young and old.  I would suggest getting it to go and finding a nice spot outdoors (weather permitting)."}
{"text":"Update: Recently spotted the dreaded \"conditional pass\" dine safe notice tucked away on the side wall of the take out counter.  Upon mentioning this to a fellow diner, she stated no longer ordering from here after spotting a cockroach shuffling across the counter.  No hand washing, no insect control, no like!"}
{"text":"First time here and I loved this Toronto food court. You can get stuff from all over the world and it's like real street vendor food. The BBQ Thai chicken is loudly whacked and chopped into pieces right in front of you and dumped over soupy noodles and Thai veggies. It was extremely good. Load it up with their homemade hot chili sauce and wow what a quick meal that doesn't cost very much nor bloat you into a food coma. If I lived in Toronto I'd go to this food court all the time."}
{"text":"If they had any food I may have given this establishment a better rating. I felt like going to a Thai restaurant for supper, so after checking out the reviews on Yelp, I headed to New Thai Food. Surprise number one- it's not a restaurant. It's a counter in a food court. Surprise number two- they didn't have any food. Not exactly no food. The pleasant lady behind the counter said they only had two items left. I took a peak at the tired looking offerings in the warming trays and gave them a pass. This is definitely not the place for a nice evening meal."}
{"text":"Knocking it down to a three because they put so little chicken on my last order it was basically vegetarian!  Still tasty ... in the narrow way that non-meat dishes can be so deemed."}
{"text":"Their hot and sour soup should be mandatory for ailing bodies. That is all."}
