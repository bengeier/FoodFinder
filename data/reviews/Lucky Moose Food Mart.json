{"text":"I like Lucky Moose for their deli cooked food section upstairs in the back of the store. This a good place for snacks and the featured cheap vegetable or fruit (big bins outside of the store front). For vegetables, I  find more selection and cheaper prices if shop further along on Spadina and Dundas. I don't notice the better smell of this place compared to other chinese grocers that some of the other reviewers mentioned."}
{"text":"Great bang for your buck here! I am amazed at how much produce I come home with after only spending about 20 dollars. You can find some of the well known brands here that they carry at regular grocery stores like dole bananas, earthbound farm greens etc. for cheaper. Generally they carry a lot of fresh fruits and vegetables. The lesser fresh stuff is always at reduction price."}
{"text":"This store is much cleaner than other grocery stores on Spadina. 
Overall produce is fresher , so its price is a little higher, but worth it."}
{"text":"I found maggots in the sweet potatoes I bought - I guess quality isn't expected of a chinatown supermarket, but mold and maggots are out of the question. 
Sadly will not be returning (it is very convenient location for me)......"}
{"text":"I love Lucky Moose Mart's name and the moose on its roof! The prices here are very reasonable. I was pleasantly surprised at how cheap their produce is! They have some snacks and flavours of snacks that are not available at T&T, like QQ gummies.

The store is pretty clean compared to the other supermarkets in Chinatown. Service is not friendly, but that is typical of Chinese supermarkets. Don't expect your cashier to smile, greet you or speak except to tell you the price."}
{"text":"The Moose is well-stocked, well-priced and convenient. Great selection of produce, Asian snacks and candy, interesting drinks (sparkling peach vinegar, anyone?) and frozen desserts. You can even pick up some yogurt, cheese and pasta sauce alongside your dumpling wrappers, mini guavas and tub of tofu."}
{"text":"If I could give it a zero rating, then I would! Today was my first time shopping here, and it is definitely my last time.

Attracted by some butternut squashes on sale, I thought I was going to get a bargain. But, it turns out that I fell for a trap! I handed $12 in 2 fivers and two loonies to the cashier to cover my bill of $6.76, but she only gave me a quarter back. Despite my objection on the spot she insisted that I only handed her $7. She wouldn't even check to see if indeed she took two five dollar bills in by accident.

Another customer commented that this frequently happens at the Lucky Moose Food Mart, and that she had been double-charged before, and the cashier refused to return her money. So all shoppers beware! Some times it's not worth sacrificing customer service for price!"}
{"text":"Bad service, Bad products.
I found one of sweet potatoes in a net obviously had mold. I asked to a shop assistant to take it out, but he said no. He said I had to buy whole things in the net. I don't understand why I have to pay for the bad quality potato. They should put a notice on the price board or put them on the bargain section."}
{"text":"Moving to Chinatown, I was very worried... Where was I going to get groceries without having to inhale fishy air and settle for non-fresh produce? AND there are no big chain supermarkets near (well there kinda are but as a student.. they can get pricey)

well Lucky Moose to the rescue! Honestly, I was shocked how well kept this place was when I first stepped in. The catchy English songs you can hear from the outside lured me inside where the music suddenly changes into Chinese (makes me chuckle to myself every time haha).

They have a lot of produce and many many many good deals! currently.. apples/oranges are 10/$2, giant pineapples for $3 (seriously they're giant, bigger than my roommate's head)  and dumplings are 8 bags for $10! but word of warning, non-asian things are a little over priced. Also, there is also a cooked food area on the back right corner where you can buy food take-out style.

SO environment wise.. the people there are nice (even the customers haha) and the place is pretty clean. Only part I don't like is the meat section, the floor is semi-wet (don't wear sandals) and sometimes there will be things that surprise you like giant fish on the floor (true story)

they take cash, debit (on purchases over $10) and credit (on purchases over $30)

You gotta drop by this place and see what you can pick up!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite grocery store. I would say :
Quality wise - awesome 
Price wise - very cheap compared to other grocery around the downtown area 
Organization - neat and tidy

If you are using debit card, you need to buy minimum 10$.
If you're using credit card, you need to buy minimum 30$. 

The above is only to avoid 50cents extra charges. Otherwise both cards are accepted.

Fresh veggies, fresh fruits, toiletries, rice, quinoa, oil, egg , meat, shampoo etc. Etc. Etc... everything is available.

Overall - pocket friendly shop. Must visit."}
{"text":"Without a real big supermarket nearby, Lucky Moose (or Lucky Moose Knuckle, as the S.O. affectionately calls it) has become our go-to market for groceries.

They sell all the Chinese staples (hoisin, tofu, pre-made steamed buns) with some commonly used ingredients from other parts of Asia (nori for sushi, fish sauce, instant noodles, and my favorite hot sauce: sriracha!). Sadly, no Korean ingredients of note. Their kimchi is a joke.

You can get cheap produce of both the Chinese and Western variety but you have to use them IMMEDIATELY; there's a reason why some of their stuff is at clearance prices.

They also have a wide selection of meat and seafood but be prepared to point and pantomime because English is very limited behind the displays. Oh, and if you buy a whole chicken, it will come with the head and feet intact so if you're squeamish about that sort of thing, go for the pre-packaged Frankenstein parts. 

Lucky Moose stocks some basic Western groceries like milk, canned tuna, pasta and tomato sauce but they don't have other stuff like flour, butter, or vanilla ice cream; all their ice cream is red bean, green tea, or taro-flavored. Go figure. 

TIP: Avoid the long lines and pay with cash at the middle till. It's like the unofficial express checkout. And forget about service with a smile. The cashiers are miserable and they all hate you."}
{"text":"Lucky Moose is an Asian supermarket in Chinatown. This is the only market in Chinatown that I go to because I don't have to hold my breath and kill myself when I walk in- no offence.

The produce here is fresh, there is a wide variety of Asian foods, treats, meats, seafood, rice- stuff a supermarket has, but here you have Asian brands. I buy most of my bubble tea supplies there as they have a lot of bubble tea flavors in stock for $2.99. The bubble tea flavors are excellent- true to their flavors (with the exception of the coconut flavor) and not too sweet. The tapioca here is good too and you can find different version of it. Also, the tea here is a must because you can find some good stuff and a ton of it and you'll never run out. They're so many other yummy things and everything is very inexpensive.

Lucky Moose is more organized and clean compared to other options in the area. I also like how the people at the cash are quick and friendly.

If you're looking for good inexpensive produce, Asian goodies, food or supplies, Lucky Moose is the place to go!"}
{"text":"It's decent produce for the price if you take the time to pick them. I would go there more often if the staff were a little friendlier or at least said hello when cashing me out."}
{"text":"Cleaner than other chinese supermarkets in the area! The prices are great and I frequently bike here to get groceries even though I live near a Metro, Sobeys and Loblaws. The produce is fresh and you can pay via debit for purchase $10 and above and with credit for $30 and above. They have hard to find shirataki noodles here and ramen noodles that is not dehydrated at 1/2 the price of a japanese mart."}
{"text":"Probably the most unhelpful staff I have ever dealt with.

I bought Hummus a couple times a few months back with a friend here, when I revisited and could not find it in the area where it was last seen, I asked for assistance. The staff not only failed to redirect me to who could perhaps know, but simply said they do not know and do not care to my face in the most rude possible manner.
This experience was not just with one staff member but with 3 separate ones. An enterprise with staff showing such regard to their customers definitely do not deserve my business."}
{"text":"Most clean Chinese grocery store in Chinatown!

The fruits and veggies are a little bit pricer than the other places, but its okay, still better than Metro."}
{"text":"I live in Chinatown and this is by far my top pick among grocery stores in the area. They have everything I need for Chinese cooking, from fresh Pixian chili bean paste to excellent soymilk and pork belly. Their produce is generally  fresh and affordable. 
Since this is my regular grocery store, I also appreciate how they have a few \"Western\" stapes - milk, cereal, yogurt, etc. - in the back. 

In comparison to other grocery stores in the area, Lucky Moose stands out because (as other reviewers have noted) the place has no bad smell. The meat area does have a bit of a smell, but it's separated off from the rest of the store (and, incidentally, the butchers are lovely people). Overall, the store is very clean and everything is well-organized.

There's also a great selection of delicious Asian snack foods, from Sriracha peas to green tea Kit Kats and Japanese \"sushi\" candy. 

Finally, it's open until 10 pm, so if you feel like grocery shopping at night (which I often do) it's there for you."}
{"text":"Come here for the produce. Don't come for the customer service.

This is where I do my weekly vegetable and fruit run.

This store has fresher fruits and vegetables than some of the other places in Chinatown. The prices are super reasonable especially if you buy multiples of fruit/veg. For example, 10 Gala apples for $4.50 or 10 navel oranges for $5 (or $0.59 each). 

I don't recommend buying other grocery staples (e.g. bread, butter) or Western foods from here. The selection is limited and prices for these items aren't any different than the big box stores. Have not bought meat or prepared foods from here, so can't comment on the quality.

Also, there's a $30 minimum if you pay with credit card. Easiest to pay with cash."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for vegetables and certain meat products, mostly veggies however unless it's ground meat! It's my hubby and my go to spot when we need certain things and its about a 10 minute walk from where we live so having it so close to home is another added bonus!"}
{"text":"Small cramped, but great if you go later in the day! Decent variety, good for picking up a few items."}
{"text":"Lucky Moose Food Mart is a large, well stocked, clean Asian food mart that may not be fully aware what a moose is (see sign). ;-)"}
{"text":"Lucky Moose is the only Chinatown store my SO will let me shop at. All the other produce stations sell blueberries that smell like fish. But at the Lucky Moose you can get you 4/$5 mangos and they don't all taste/smell like fish. When I needed to make a last minute Super-bowl gumbo, the Lucky Moose had the okra and corn. I couldn't believe they had the weird ingredients, exactly what I needed, exactly when I needed them.  
I'm mostly veggie, so I haven't ventured to the back butcher/fishmonger. 
Milk expiry dates are pretty good, but as Susan C says, the kimchi is nearly carbonated and produce is to use ASAP.  
Also, reports in Toronto Star indicate that the owner beat up a customer who took it upon himself to take the five-finger discount. So, don't even think about tasting the grapes before purchase!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  

There is a relatively large selection of fresh fruits and vegetables all offered at extremely reasonable prices.  

The dry goods section is not quite as impressive as larger stores like T & T but they cover all the basics.

The prepared goods at this store is not bad.  In fact, it is much better than the prepared goods at T & T.  At T & T all the prepared foods have a fairly strong preservative taste and smell that really turns me off.  

One of my favourite things to purchase at the Lucky Moose is a collection of prepared tofu/ bean curd offered in an aluminum(?) container in the tofu section of the store - far left/ opposite side of the fresh veggies. The cost is $4.99 but totally worth it since you can make a meal out of it with some white rice.  This is far superior to the similar tofu/ bean curd collection sold at T & T.  The deep fried tofu balls are also extremely tasty too.  And I have just discovered fresh shanghai noodles for $1.29 - delicious!!!

There is an elevated second floor - accessible by ramp or stairs - that features a meat area and a prepared foods section.  Food up on this second floor is not too bad ... not restaurant quality but it is extremely reasonably priced i.e., purchased a deep fried crab type thing and I think it was less than $5 - can't quite remember.  

Western foods are not overly priced - I have found oreos sold for $3 and I think the price of chips are also competitive.    

Although the aisles are narrow and the place typically crowded, this grocery store truly does make an effort to be accessible to the handicap (or in my case, baby in a stroller).

And of course, could the name of this grocery store be any cooler?!  

The only downside to this grocery store is that they do not offer a parking lot - you must pay for street or garage parking."}
{"text":"Lucky Moose is very cheap compared to going to a Superstore or Metro and they have everything a typical T&T would have (including the hot food section). Parking is not to best, but it IS downtown, after all. Don't come here looking for quinoa or laundry detergent but if you're looking for cheap food and import snacks, Lucky Moose is your place.  (Not sure how trusting I would be of Chinatown meat though)"}
{"text":"Pour faire ses courses pas chers, en particulier sur les produits asiatiques.
Le stand boucherie est une immersion complète dans le Chinatown de Toronto!

Best place to go for cheap groceries especially asian products.
The butcher stand is a nice experience for the tourists who want to have a taste of the real Chinatown of Toronto!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service, cashiers are super rude. I would understand if it was due to language barriers, but we were speaking Mandarin. The produce is on the cheaper side but usually not very fresh. If you don't mind the bad customer service, then go check the place out, but it definitely isn't for me."}
{"text":"Mom wanted Chinese sausage from Canada (Toronto to be more specific), and this place had it!  I found a variety of sausages to choose from;  From Vancouver to Washington to Ontario.  A better selection versus some of the other Asian markets in the area is what I'm getting at. 

Anyways, about this market, they seem to have everything you'd need.  And they also seem a bit cleaner too.  At the entrance, you'll find various fruits and vegetables.  Fresh seafood with live fish tanks holding large crabs, lobster, fish obviously, and other shellfish all located in the upper rear of the store. 

We also found some Indonesians snacks, Pocky and Hello Panda Japanese treats, although I may have missed the green tea KitKats.  Spices and sauces from practically every Asian country, and a lot more.  Chinese,  Filipino, Vietnamese rice paper, Korean noodles, Thai curries, they got it! 

Their pricing of items were OK as well, with your typical '2 for $3' type of sale signs.  As I was ready for check out, I only had U.S. dollars and didn't notice I was in the \"cash only\" register.  I was expecting the rolling-eyes of rudeness, instead the young cashier lady was nice and helpful.  Call me the Lucky Moose I guess!

Mom, I'm coming home with your missing ingredients!"}
{"text":"I ventured in because of the funny name. 
I stayed because I found great Asian groceries, including my cooking staple- Chiu Chow Chili Oil. 
(i literally put it in everything...Pasta, Tofu, Fried Rice...anything)

I also found...the 3.15 Rose Tea Au Lait...which is pretty much non-existent in NorCal and SO hard to find in SoCal. YUM

Will be back when i need to fill up on my Asian cooking supplies. Prices were reasonable..."}
{"text":"Lucky Moose is my go-to for fresh fruit and vegetable all year long. The prices are very fair, fruit isn't marked up like at many grocery chains, and they are honest about what is good for the next week, and what you should eat asap. My typical shop includes fresh food, tofu and re-stock on specific noodles. There are countless choices and great foods to try - also a large selection of fresh fish and prepared food.

I am always in and out in 10 minutes, with $30 of fresh fruit and veg that will last me two weeks. 

Walk, with a backpack, if you can.
Otherwise you may get lucky with a street parking spot directly outside, or around the corner."}
{"text":"The thing is that it says Lucky Moose in English but really the plaza is called the Golden Bull in Chinese. 

This is the only supermarket I go to in Chinatown. They have an excellent selection and fresh veggies. Everything is cheap, and you can get HUGE chicken drumsticks."}
{"text":"Pros:
- Inexpensive selection of vegetables, some meats
- Good selection of Asian vegetables
- Decent freshness for perishable foods compared with other Chinatown grocers
- Open fairly good hours

Cons:
- Lacklustre service: sometimes no eye contact or acknowledgement from cashiers
- Needs minimum for credit cards
- Sometimes prices and country of origin of the vegetables are not visible
- Some of the staff do not speak English
- Not that great for Western foods - prices might be on the higher end for non-Asian goods"}
{"text":"I was passing by with a friend and decided to check out some fruits. The shop is small but enough to get the essential. The price is really cheap at high quality compared to chain groceries like Metro and Loblaws. It's Chinese New Year, so they are selling some mini tangerines with leaves. Wish they would sell some bigger ones for big fortune. End up buying some green grape only."}
{"text":"Nice grocery market with lots of asian seasoning, vegetables, and snacks
Cheaper than metro or other regular non-asian grocery places!
They have all sort of nice fresh fruit (especially strawberries! DAMN these strawberries are amazing - fresh, red strawberries for $1.99/box) 

Not the most organized place, and the aisles are very narrow, but this could also mean you'd bump into lots of strangers/acquaintances/friends and get friendly with them while looking for something on the shelf!
Not all staffs here are fluent in English."}
{"text":"I was not very impressed with my experience at Lucky Moose. First, I did not like the fact that frozen food was being displayed on the outdoor porch. Granted it is winter and it is frigidly cold out so the goods would be unlikely to spoil, I just still prefer to see my frozen groceries in a freezer! There is a distinctly 'fishy' odor at the back of the store where they sell the fresh fish, but it's not even a normal fish-stall smell... it's not like when you pass the fresh fish stands at St. Lawrence Market. I did not find that the prices here were considerably better than nearby Sobeys or Metro, so I would definitely not return just to save money. Something else that was off-putting was the fact that they charge you $0.50 to use credit cards if you spend less than $30. I can understand it to some extent when stores want you to spend at least $10, but $30 is a bit steep in my opinion! Finally, surly does not even begin to describe the cashier I had - there was no customer service whatsoever!

I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Most Asian food marts are no-frills and usually pretty run down. Cleanliness is not a primary feature. Although it does become part of the charm in many cases, atmosphere just isn't something you associate with these types of stores. But Lucky Moose is different. 

Clean, well organized, and priced fairly well, they also have one of the best fresh fruit and vegetable selections in the area. I've picked up 10 Royal Gala apples for $4.50 and 5 California oranges (not just by type, these were actually from California) for $2.50. Mushrooms of all kinds, fresh and also cheap. They have a full selection of noodles to make any Asian dish and fresh chow mein to make into crispy noodles or....chow mein! 

The cashiers are not very talkative if you don't speak Cantonese or Mandarin, but they are quick!  Checking your items out takes no time at all.

They also have their own butcher shop. It doesn't small very good (not spoiled....just a lot of seafood) but prices are great (6 bone in pork chops for $4!). 

If you smoke, cigarettes are fairly cheap here. They have a lunch counter too.

Worth the trip!"}
{"text":"The Lucky Moose is all you need in a Chinese grocery store. It has..

1. A great selection of Asian products, including some delicious ginger candies.

2. No western concept of customer service. 

3. Fresh produce.

4. Well organized aisles and shelves neatly stacked in a small space.

5. Good prices on most items. While you might find some individual items cheaper in Chinatown, the prices here are not bad."}
{"text":"Not much variety, small and cramped, the hot food looks mediocre and a lot of the products are made in China so usually I stay away from them. Did buy a package of zucchinis on sale and a bag of Japanese matcha Oreos."}
{"text":"Cleanliness of a Canadian grocery with products and prices of and Asian foodmart. Great selection, great value and easy to navigate. A smidge cramped in some spots so it can be a bit hard to juggle your food and try to climb over people but it's not bad at all compared to most markets in China Town.

For about $50 I got about 2 weeks worth of groceries, mostly produce and frozen protein with some assorted sauces and noodles. I epecially loved the packs of tofu that had been pre-fried. They are made in Toronto and are super convenient to throw in soups, hotpots and stir-fries. 

Great place to shop!"}
{"text":"This is our go to grocery store whenever we come to the area! Like most Chinese grocery stores (or the many from my childhood), there is a full seafood and meat butchering area, produce areas, and a mix of all the good sauces, instant noodles, Asian ingredients, etc. that cannot always be found at a regular grocery store (including my fermented tofu and thousand year old eggs!). Everything is very fairly priced, with a lot of cheap deals on produce (which changes seasonally). The produce can be in different conditions, from must eat immediately to should be okay for about two weeks. Spices are also dirt cheap! 

I will definitely be back for all the great deals and obscure asian ingredients!"}
{"text":"3.5/5

Lucky Moose Food Mart is probably one of the better supermarkets in Chinatown. We know Chinese produce aren't known for their freshness (and make up for that in their price), but this supermarket actually balances freshness and prices quite well.

Their produce in this supermarket is quite superb. Trust me, I'm from Markham and I know where to get fresh produce there, this place actually stacks up quite well to the giants up there.

For a small supermarket, their organization is excellent. At least there's no food lying on the floor, and the aisles generally represent related categories of food instead of it being a giant conglomerate mess.

Don't expect good cashier treatment here, which is quite typical of most Chinese supermarkets. They probably won't even say a word to you, which is again very normal. Just read the screen, pay your food, and out you go."}
{"text":"I am trying to eat more fruits and vegetables, so I've made it a mid-year resolution of sorts to stop here once a week.  I don't know that it's the best grocery store in Chinatown or anything, because I haven't come close to being in them all, but I do know that the selection is great and the prices are amazing.  To give an example, today I bought two pounds of strawberries (from the US unfortunately), a pint of blueberries, 10 limes (10/$1), and a plum, for a grand total of $3.78.  Seriously.  How could you not be a fan?

I don't necessarily agree with the comments about the produce being on its last legs and needing to be used right away. While that is true for SOME of the fruit sometimes, it is not always the case.  I've had some blackberries for 3 days now that are still fresh and I am sure they will be good for 3 more days at least.

They have a selection of hot foods and also a fish/meat section in the back, but I haven't explored enough to comment yet.

Also, the Lucky Moose is east of Spadina so if you are taking the subway (or coming from the other side of Yonge Street) and don't want to walk all the way in to Chinatown, it is very close to the university line."}
{"text":"I went to this store for the first time last weekend, and I was pleasantly surprised.  Yes, it is a bit more expensive than the other stores, yes, it caters to more of a Western clientele, but it's also clean, well organized, well stocked, and everything looks good and fresh.  I'll probably do some of my shopping there, but continue to get sauces at one of the stores on Spadina."}
{"text":"Ridiculously cheap produce that's often nearing the end of its lifespan; mysterious purple fowl in the meat section; hundreds of mysterious fruit jellies; huge bins of blue crab and 18-packs of quail egg; Ramune and Kratingdaeng (yes, that's Red Bull, yes it's $1.50, and no it's not carbonated!)... Indeed, Lucky Moose has it all. 

Except for ordinary stuff like flour and peanut butter and sliced bread, which is either nowhere to be found, or it's as hilariously expensive as the produce is cheap. 

Here it doesn't have the disturbing odours of the markets on Spadina, and you can get lost in the aisles revelling in the wild assortment of ingredients. Dried shrimp paste!  Powders in every colour and texture imaginable! Restorative herbal soup mixes! Dozens of cooking liquors and wines!

It's so very interesting here. I love this store, in spite of and indeed because of its little quirks. The cashiers are impressively sullen and noncommunicative. Presumably they speak English, but they've certainly never spoken to *me.* If I'm lucky, they'll mumble the price of my purchases to me. Who cares though? I'm just here to pay for my groceries, not for conversation. And I can read the total from the register as well as they can."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed shopping at The Moose.  Their produce is generally very fresh and reasonably priced.  The hugest onions I have ever seen and they had VIETNAMESE RED DRAGON FRUIT which is expensive ... but once in a while ...

Excellent variety of different soya sauce brands especially my favourite one (Kimlan) from Taiwan.  They had longan and different fruits from S.E. Asia.  Good selection of noodles (fresh) and biscuits.

Narrow aisles, lots of shoppers, always busy.  Good prices.  Efficient service - in and out, brisk."}
{"text":"Always travel here to get groceries living downtown. Cheap prices and good groceries :) 

There's a great selection of snacks and drinks and everything it's great!"}
{"text":"We Canadians stopped using pennies (coins), they put up a sign with their own version of the round up rule in their favor. Basically round everything UP to the nearest 10 cents. Even if it is $1.91 it gets round up to $2.00. Prices overall are okay, but I found better."}
{"text":"This is a place to I bumped into when I strolled around in the Chinatown of Toronto. I had too much food with friends, so I decided to get something light. What I had in mind was Congee Cans, easy to digest, and it is my way to tide over indigestion, It always works. This food mart have everything I need. I bought some fruit, plus congee cans. It is clean and you can get some lunchbox. Of course, the mart doesn't accept credit cards."}
{"text":"This place is smaller than other Asian supermarkets on Spadina (like Oriental Harvest) meaning it does not have much variety in terms of brands for sauces sauces or different cuts of meat. But they offer the staples and the most popular brands which, frankly speaking, is good enough. The fruits and produce here are usually fresh and the prices for them are way cheaper than your chain supermarkets. Don't expect to receive any questions with an understanding face though. The staff here are mainly Chinese and if you're looking for an obscure ingredient that you read off the internet for a recipe, good luck. In addition to groceries, they do sell some kitchenwares at the back."}
{"text":"After having lived here for several years, I've grown to love this place. It's clean for a chinese supermarket, they bag your groceries for you, the cashiers are quick, they have lots of neat asian food as well as more mainstream foods, and lastly of course the price. The price of broccoli here is the super special sale price at other (non-chinese) supermarkets in the area! Not only that, but I found the freshness very similar to other supermarkets for the most part."}
{"text":"Lucky Moose seems to be the cleanest and neatest of all the Chinatown grocery stores.  As a result, their prices tend to be more expensive than any of the other larger, but less clean, supermarkets on Spadina Ave.  They have a full range of Asian products here, as well as non-Asian foods (this was probably the only time I've come across arugula at an Asian grocery store?!)"}
{"text":"Like others have said. Cleaner, but slightly more expensive than other Chinatown grocery fare. Ive heretofore not been brave enough to sample the prepared foods, but I think I just might, soon. Ive been eyeing those $1.99 packages of stir fried noodles. 

I give The Lucky Moose 5 stars for being down the road from me, interesting, cheap, and open until 10pm every night.

edit: Don't try the $1.99 trays of fried noodles."}
{"text":"Def found my favorite Asian grocery store in Toronto! It is wayy better than the ones on Spadina Ave.

On top of a wide variety of grocery items, they also have hot foods section on a selection of (mostly) Chinese stuffs. ANDD they are 50% off after 8pm!!

Grocery items are organized neatly.

Unlike some Asian grocery stores, they have a good ventilation system and a separate cordon on meat and seafood/fish section so the store doesn't smell.

Coming from Houston, where grocery stores there are as big as malls here, I still feel like I'm at your corner convenience store. And every thing here seem to be at least $1-2 pricier."}
{"text":"I have been doing my groceries here for a while. However, I stopped coming here recently after realizing how terrible and abundant all their plastic packaging is! 

90% of the vegetables in their vegetable aisle are packed in plastic wrap with styrofoam, same with some of their fruits. Why do you need to pack 3 bell peppers or 6 pears together?!

Please consider a more environmentally friendly method."}
