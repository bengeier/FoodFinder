{"text":"I used to come to this place because I was working at St. Clair & Avenue Rd, which is nice area but a wasteland in terms of restaurants and cafes.

To summarize:
The long espresso is exactly to my liking
The prepared salads are pretty good but overpiced
The sandwiches are stale and look like they came out of a vending machine"}
{"text":"This place is terrible.  The service is dreadful - no smiles, no thank you, just give me your money.  They over charge for everything.   Its close to where I work, so I sometimes go out of necessity, but always regret it.  One time I got a yoghurt parfait, with blueberries, the blueberries were so old, they tasted of mold.  It was too late to return it, as I took it to go and plus I didn't want to deal with the awkward conversation with the workers there.  Terrible place, avoid."}
{"text":"To start, this place is not a destination. I'd say 90% of their business comes from the workers in the office building located above it. 
   Their coffee isn't that great, the standard lunch fare is decent but somehow they have these pretty amazing croissants. For awhile there I was getting a few a week but fortunately cut down my intake to about one.
   I enjoy coming here, getting my coffee, croissant and reading a fashion magazine from their  selection on a lazy afternoon but not for too long-- they play the cheesiest music."}
{"text":"Love these guys! I just discovered them for catering on Platterz.ca. I've used them several times for the office, be it meetings or staff lunches, and its always amazing! the bread is so fresh and the salads are delicious! They deliver and the order is always on time and prompt. Definitely reco for office catering."}
