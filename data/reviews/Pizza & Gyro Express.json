{"text":"my favorite place to eat in the area. lunch buffet is very cheap -under $5. gyro meat can get scarce   if crowded, but fresh stuff is usually coming out soon. cant say much for the pizza. some like it, i like a sweeter sauce.  dinner is great. they have everything gyro and ive had it all. the gyro pizza stromboli hoagies and the gyros themselves are second to none. they re very reasonable in their prices and the place seats alot of ppl so theres usually not a wait on the weekends.  try the gyro pockets on the appetizer menu. they re $8 but you get for and only eat 2 bc they re huge and you ll have 2 for later. for the appetizer menu, they re a meal in itself.  ill walk through fire and over glass to go to this place.  try itt"}
