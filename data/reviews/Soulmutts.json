{"text":"So much lack of communication. They never answer the phone. When they tried emailing us the confirmation the email bounced back and didn't bother contacting one of the phone numbers we had provided! It took several calls and text messages from two different numbers to get a text back saying the email bounced and that's why they couldn't confirm.   When my mom got to the place she called several times and circled the property and got no answer. She had to move her car and she got a text back saying \"you're not outside our property, we are located at xyz\" if you didn't answer your phone why don't you just call back?! What if your customer is lost or they need clarification? What if maybe you were looking at the window but they're still in their car so that's why you can't see them? Replying to a text message which is asking you to answer the phone with \"you're not here\" denotes lack of empathy, which is the most important quality if I'm to leave my pet there. There is a no-knock policy (which makes sense) so why not be diligent with the phone? My mom waited 20 minutes staring at the door from her car calling but by the time they answered she left."}
{"text":"I hate to write bad review for soulmutts as we truly believed that this is genuine place where dogs are in good care. But we were VERY wrong. Owner has extremely poor communication skills. As mentioned by another person in Yelp in her review.  We left our 10lbs dog with soulmutts for holidays and went to pick him up a day earlier than the actual pick up date thinking that it's doggie day care  and boarding facility someone will be with dogs at all times even if Allison is not there some other attendant would be in. Thinking its holidays she must be busy whoever will be there We will get our dog from them. But to our shock when we reached soulmutts house was locked down and All dogs were left alone in dark. And there were more than 20 dogs in that facility. We waited almost 2 hours thinking some one would come eventually. The guy named Paul came apologized and said he has no idea what's going on as this is his first day back to work after holidays and he kept changing his story as to why dogs were left alone. He said he went to pick up beer which he had in his hand. Alison gave another story he went to pick up his stuff from parents house. We really didn't care what he story was. Just shocked how could you leave dogs unattended. Especially Small Dogs are like kids who get scared In dark you can't leave them ALONE in dark.    Biggest disappointment was when we finally saw our dog he had awful stink and we knew he was not cleaned for last six days since he had been there. He was shaking,trembling and scared. And Paul would not let us even come closer to the main door as if he was hiding what was going on Inside house. Our dog almost died of negligent behaviour of this owner. Our dog front left paw had small wound which became worse in Soulmutts care. They did not even return our dogs meds.   If you want your dog to be safe and happy do not leave your dog at Soulmutts.  this place is all about making easy money."}
{"text":"Amazing first-time experience here! Ali picked up our dog and whisked him away for a week of fun times on River St. When we picked him up, he was excited to see us, but he also threw his happy little self at the staff, who obviously had a great time with him, too. We also appreciated the little tour we got upon pick-up and the photos they sent while we were away. Much recommended, thanks Alison and team!"}
{"text":"Ally took our stranger-shy lab/beagle mix for 5 days while we were out of town. She is awesome. Right from the get-go with Mia, she worked to develop a bond with her, and to not intimidate her. Her experience with rescue dogs comes through.  I wanted my dog to stay somewhere she'd get personal TLC, taken on really good walks, and not be in a cage alone. Ally gives the dog free run of her place and lots of pets and people time.  She also took our dog with her pack to a 1+ acre secure wooded facility to get some exercise and outdoors time.  I loved getting a daily text with a pic of my dog playing around and looking so happy.   I'm glad that there's a convenient, warm, awesome place for boarding right here in the city."}
{"text":"This place is incredible and truly cares about the dogs that they watch.  I was so impressed with the customer service and even more impressed with how happy Charlie was when I brought him home.  He has been depressed from other places and so have I because of the way that they treat me and the dogs (Hounds of York in particular).  This place absolutely treats all the dogs and all the animals incredible and Charlie comes home happy healthy and eating (a problem before, but not worth Soulmutts! )."}
{"text":"Soul Mutts took great care of my dog. I called ahead of my Toronto visit, made sure my pup had all of her shots, and reserved a spot in advance. The dog's intro to the pack was handled well, and my pup came back happy and tired from playing with her new friends. I recommend."}
{"text":"Soulmutts is amazing!  Alison is so wonderfully friendly and knowledgeable- a fantastic pack leader and astute business owner.  Owners and employees have extensive experience and training; the business is properly licensed, registered and insured; and boarding/day-care candidates are interviewed for behaviour before being allowed to board to make sure they can fit in well.  Soulmutts is a unique boarding experience for dogs who like their freedom and enjoy being with other dogs. Located in a strategically renovated home, dogs can roam around supervised on the ground floor, hop up on couches and beds, and make it their second home.  They have a transformed backyard where dogs can play, and do their doodies.  We couldn't have asked for a more ideal boarding facility! No crates, no secluded kennels, no hard concrete floors- just a lot of love, family and homeyness.    Be sure to contact Soulmutts a few weeks/months in advance so you can go to for a consultation.  We weren't able to go into their house during the consult, understandably so, it's Paul and Alison's home.  It's also a controlled environment and strangers can easily upset it.   We dropped off our 1.5 year old social-butterfly of a  beagle for a weekend and he barely wanted to come back with us.  He was exhausted after a weekend of playing in the park, then playing at home, and socializing.  We dropped him off again for day care, and he was so eager to jump into Alison's arms when we turned to corner to get to the house.  We found that booking ahead, keeping to a schedule and communicating by email and text (vs. phone calls) is best.  There are strict business practices and etiquette for dog owners as well as dogs, all in the interests of the dogs.    I commend Alison and Paul's dedication to their work while keeping the interests of their clients (dogs and people).  It's perfectly reasonable to follow a scheduled pick up time and date,  just as you would schedule a time with a doctor, mechanic, or make a dinner reservation.  It would be unreasonable to show up un-announced and expect that the doctor cure your flu, the mechanic to replace your engine, the restaurant have your meal ready, or Soulmutts have your dog ready.   Thanks Soulmutts! We'll see you again soon!"}
{"text":"As expected, Soulmutt's replied with another message denying their responsibility. In fact, it seems that they have hijacked my review to promote their \"famous Pug-O-Ween\".  Look, I'm not here to argue with the owner of Soulmutts, I'm only here to describe my own experience while letting other fur parents know what happened to my pup while in their care. I think Soulmutt's response to my previous review just demonstrates their denial of responsibility.  I, too, \"have all our correspondence documented\". You state that you notified me in very full details, and that my dog was not a good fit for your pack. In fact, I would love to post the screenshots to show how contradictory your reply to my review is. Asking me to explain the bleeding - does that sound like you gave me very full details? The outing was awesome etc. Didn't have any issues with him! etc. Does that sound like my dog wasn't a good fit for your pack? Your company requires a screening of all dogs prior to any services, if he wasn't a good fit then how come he was picked up from my apartment and put in a van full with other dogs to the outing? Please explain. If you would like me to post the full report - I would be happy to comply. For you to reply to comment with such false information just demonstrates your unprofessionalism."}
{"text":"We were planning a trip to Toronto and booked with Soul mutts weeks ahead of time to pick up our dog for day care while we went out for the day.   A few days before our arrival in Toronto I emailed Allison to confirm our arrangement and I didn't get any response. I waited a few days and then emailed her again. Still no response so I called her a few times and went to voicemail. The voicemail directed me with a number to text her so I did that too and still now response. The morning out dog was supposed to be picked up at 7:30 and nobody showed up or contacted us to cancel or anything.  This is a completely unprofessional way to run a buisness. People need to be able to rely on dog sitting services and this place has proven to be completely unreliable. I would never trust my dog with someone this irresponsible."}
