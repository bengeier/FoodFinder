{"text":"I always order the sicilian pizza from here. It really is hit or miss. The last sicilian I ordered had too much sauce and the non crust dough was completely raw. Totally inedible. Just remember to order light sauce on this pizza and you will be good. The pepperoni rolls are good also."}
{"text":"Love this place! All the food is delicious and fresh; the pizza had a beautiful, fluffy, crispy  crust, a wonderful sauce, and fresh vegetables. 
     I'd put it right up there with any Pittsburgh pizza anywhere. Soups are delicious, too.       The service is good and friendly, the place is cute and pleasant, comfortable, and warm in ambiance. Its attached to a bar with great music, but the doors are kept closed and you cannot even hear that theres a bar there. All in all, cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"ordered delivery to a nearby hotel and was promised 45 minutes or less. 1 and 1/2 hours later my pizza and salad arrived and both were the same temperature, that is to say slightly warm.

Pizza was ok, might have been better hot, but the salad was pretty poor. I realized afterward that they also overcharged me. Overall poor value and service. Try somewhere else if you are in this area as you can't do any worse."}
{"text":"it says they're closed sunday! they're open sundays! They're open Sundays! Rewriting the same thing because Yelp wouldn't post because it's shorter than most posts. Not sure how long it has to be though"}
{"text":"Sounds like things haven't changed. Bad service bad attitude. Just close for F's sake."}
{"text":"Love the food! I come here with my friends once a week."}
{"text":"My elderly parents and I visit weekly and until recently was mostly satisfied over the last couple months consistent mistakes missing sauce rude n unattended bar always chat on cellphone or talking friends  in you say excuse me the blonde bartender who say her brother is owner Told me SHUT  Up....Wow!
