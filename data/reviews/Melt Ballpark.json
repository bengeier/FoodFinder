{"text":"Nowhere near as good as the Melt Restaurants. The bread was \"meh\" and the cheese wasn't even melted through. May give it another shot, but not likely."}
{"text":"I have been to actual Melt locations and purchased sandwiches with a mound of fries from them for the same price that I purchased a half of two slices of bread with about a quarter of the fillings. My fianc√© got the kindergarten and it was three slices of American cheese. Extremely disappointed with the size of the sandwiches and the lack of the accompaniments that were with it for the price that was only a buck less than a regular location."}
{"text":"This place does not even deserve to be called a Melt!! I got a simple \"Kindergarten\" and the bread was somehow both soggy and stale, barely hot when I picked it up, the cheese wasn't melted all the way (!) and ended up having a gummy consistency like it had been microwaved. It was a half sandwich (by normal standards, not Melt standard) and I still didn't finish it because it was so bad. Huge disappointment."}
{"text":"Transplanting the tasty ingredients (or at least 10 sandwiches' worth of them), but few of the charming accoutrements of the home base establishments, the Gateway Melt outpost feels a little bit like a fast food joint wherein speed dwarfs heart, and the staggering list of eclectic add-ons has been sliced and diced down to its bare essentials.  \"Where's the soul?\" Patrons asked the other day during lunch rush. \"I've found the cheese (and I'm drooling over it), but where's the old school spark of vitality?\" Indeed, everything without direct purpose seems to have been jettisoned: gone are the jolly holiday decorations, ditto the cutesy vinyl cover menus (the latter for obvious reasons--a date-night establishment this is not). Orders are now taken on check-list cards and the menu, as mentioned, is limited to the heavy hitters (mushroom, chorizo, BBQ, etc.) The cheese and thick-sliced bread remain, naturally, and they're still undeniably delicious. How Melt makes their American cheese so much like a synecdoche of the country itself: rich and robust and shiny bright, will forever be a mystery. Sadly, the sandwiches themselves are often less than the sum of their parts: slapped together assembly-line style and slopped into take-out boxes with a handful of fries salty enough to inspire tongue lesions. Vegetarians would do well to steer clear of the veggie burger, which was somehow both gummy and dry at the same time. The wait at high noon, while not as hideous as say Barrio's (which has been known to produce scads of Methuselahs daily), was nonetheless protracted. It should be noted that food is made as tickets go in, with no real regard for dining parties, so members of your lunch group could be served in a staggered way if you don't all take pains to order simultaneously. This might seem trivial, but at least one guest was served a good fifteen minutes after his companions on a recent visit. With only an hour to spare for lunch, many people would see this as a real inconvenience. Still, though this joint is David Foster Wallace melted down to Hemingway, it is still the same product in essence as can be found in the many larger flagship stores. The veggies are fresh and the sandwiches are reasonably priced for their apocalyptic enormity. If you wake up at your desk some afternoon screaming, 'I'm as hungry as heck, and I'm not going to take it anymore!' you can do a lot worse."}
{"text":"Expecting something more than a half sandwich with mushrooms and cheese for $10. No meat $10?  How about $7 with no meat. The shredded pork half sandwich is also $10. Chips come with all, but most food stands include chips, which I like.  Was good. Just expensive. But so is the restaurant."}
{"text":"I hate to be this way because I love melt. But we went to an Indians game and the Melt stand was completely closed and had the baricades around it is how I'll describe it. Tweeted melt... Didn't hear back. so just to be clear, this is the melt stand at Jacobs field. Menu looked comparable in price to regular melt stores. No info online let me know if it hadn't worked out? Also nothing on melt website? And no response? = 1 star - just so people know if they make a special trip for melt, that we were unsuccessful in visiting this location, but game was good - go Tribe."}
