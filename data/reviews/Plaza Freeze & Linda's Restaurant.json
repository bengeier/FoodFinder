{"text":"Good food, great prices. My husband got the he-man omelette which he loved. Onions rings were hot and crispy. Tuna melt wasn't very melty."}
{"text":"It was a dark, sultry Tuesday morning. The clouds still setting their dim tone upon the day. I walk in greeted by the many wonderful faces of all men waiting for their morning cup of joe. I sit down, already feeling the joy that is to come with a stuffed onion and bacon omelette. Extra onions. The beautiful lady in plaid brings me my liquid gold. I sip. I gulp. So good."}
{"text":"The salad was brown ice burg lettuce.  The grilled cheese sandwich had only one slice of cheese. Overall, it was kind a disappointing experience"}
{"text":"Came her around 6am place was pretty packed. It's pretty much the only place open at 6am on a Saturday. Ordered 2 eggs over easy with white toast and a side order of chopped beef and gravy over toast and I have to say for a hole in the wall place the food was pretty good. And the side order was huge I can only imagine what a full looked like. But menu choice was simple dosnt look like any steak options only sizzle steaks but that's ok still pretty decent for a quick bite."}
