{"text":"Cannot get enough of the vitamin sea bowl, anything with kimchi is good in my mind.  Can't wait to try their smoothies and the acai bowls. Staff are really nice which just makes it that much more pleasant."}
{"text":"Being from Vancouver, where healthy, cheap and quick food options abound, I was incredibly excited when Bolt opened up in my neighbourhood.  The Vitamin Sea bowl is a wonderful blend of grain, seaweeds, and veggies, and I love it. I've also had a few of their smoothies and they do not disappoint!   The only reason that I give this place 4 stars instead of 5 is that they need to work a little on consistency. I've had the Greena Colada a few times - the first it was a dreamy smooth tropical slice of heaven, and the next it tasted bitter and icy. sadface.  Same with the grain bowls - sometimes they are heavenly and others the quinoa is undercooked and the ratio of ingredients is all off.   Overall though, I love this place. Great staff. Nice environment. Decent prices. Healthy  and delicious foods. If you're on Queen West and you need a quick bite of something that is NOT pizza or poutine, this place is your jam!"}
{"text":"Ugghhh. I am eternally disappointed. I haven't been around to have an acai bowl all winter, and given it's warm and summery, I thought \"oh hey, I'm gonna get myself some bolt deliciousness\". Much to my dismay they've changed their prices, and removed the best part: the coconut whipped cream. It's now 1.50 extra just for that. I mean, come on. Not only was my bowl lacklustre and plopped together with no care, it was made out of order (aka I was shuffled behind people who ordered well after me), by staff who seemed to care less. I never thought I'd see this day, but. Don't count on me coming back any time soon."}
{"text":"If I had to meet a missed work deadline after 5p.m. anywhere else on earth, I don't know what I'd be eating! This place is great and it is the only place that has managed to offer a salad with my favourite ingredients in it (without me listing them). Their Vitamin Sea Bowl combines Kimchi, glass noodles, avocado, kelp and lemon tahini dressing, along with other must-have salad ingredients in one eating. Love it-- thanks for keeping me fueled team Bolt! Onwards!"}
{"text":"Feeling peckish, went in for a healthy snack. Had the Vitamin Sea Bowl (see what they did there?) which was quite average, there was nothing dazzling about it and, for $13 on rice and shredded carrots and cabbage, i was expecting darn dazzle.  There you have it, happiness again turns out to be reality minus expectations. The latter did me in.  I recommend you keep walking past this place and go for slightly better grub at Fresh or Queen and Dufferin."}
{"text":"Just what I needed today: a fresh smoothie - chocolate and PB - and kombucha. The smoothie was awesome! And the kombucha was a new brand I've not tried before & tasted great!   I loved the music they were playing today. The staff were loving it too;  singing along. They were all genuinely friendly and the speed of their service was outstanding!   Since I'm always 5 minutes behind, their speedy service gave 5 minutes back to me!   Got my day back on track and re-energized too!  Thank - you!"}
{"text":"I'm only giving this a 4-star rating for now as I've only tried one item from Bolt (this was my first time trying).  First of all, the descriptions they provide for each menu item are fantastic - everything sounds amazing and I couldn't help but drool over each item.  I chose the Vitamin Sea Bowl because I love sea vegetables and I wanted to see if it would live up to my expectations - and it did! Everything in the bowl was fresh and there were just enough toppings so that it wasn't over-bearing. At first it looks like a lot of kelp, but with all the other toppings, I would definitely say that the kelp enhanced the flavour of the bowl as opposed to drowning out all the other flavours.  As I was watching the guy (I wish I knew his name) prep the bowl, I thought that he must surely be over-portioning the quinoa and all the toppings. Especially because the bowl is only $9. Suffice it to say, the amount that I walked away with was substantial giving the affordable price point - for the quality and amount that I got, I'd say that Bolt is definitely comparable to Live Food Market (but they're honestly a fraction of the price!!).  I'll definitely go back there again. And again."}
{"text":"Unsanitary practices, I was disgusted. They have this employee who has got to be the most unfriendly and inappropriately dressed food handler I've ever encountered (just for pure description purpose, she's Asian, with facial piercings). She prepared food for the person ahead of me. Used her fingers to scoop vegetables/fruits, no gloves, then exchanged money to complete the transaction. WITHOUT WASHING HER HANDS, she proceeded to prepare my order, touched the fruit with her hands, wiped them on her shirt and then took my money. GROSS! Can you imagine the filth that's on her hands, touching the food that customers are about to consume?!   During the summer, she wears these teeny short short spandex shorts (more like underwear) and half of her bottom hangs out, I AM STARING AT HER BARE AS*!! I think another reviewer commented on this.  Let's not forget that regardless of how tasty this food may be or how popular this place may be, this is a FOOD joint and certain practices are unacceptable.  Another thing with this place is that servers think they're too cool to prepare your food. No smiles, barely any eye contact, as if I'm bothering them by being there?  I'm tired of these \"cool\" places that are popping up, where attitude is on the menu.  Get real. Be nice to customers. Otherwise, you won't get any. And for god's sake, wash your hands and at least try to wear clothes  that don't expose your as*."}
{"text":"I never post reviews but after my last experience, I need to do so.  I used to go here quite regularly but last week I went and had a really gross experience. They use their bare hands to prepare the meals - no biggie if they're using utensils to make it, but when they are actually using their fingers to sprinkle stuff on to your bowl its kinda gross. Even grosser when it is the same person who was checking out a customer before and handling their money and then does the same for you.  I emailed them to let them know of my concerns. No response. I wouldn't have written this review if they had and addressed my concerns but they obviously don't care about their customers. You'd think after the whole Chipotle scandal restaurants would care more about this sort of thing. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Their parfaits are good but salads are mediocre. Everything is pricey. Also customer service is not consistent. On the weekend I had a lovely girl serve me, today an aloof hipster chick gave me attitude as she cashed me out. Not a place I would frequent regularly."}
{"text":"Love this place so much thank goodness it opened near my place. I grab a few smoothies and juices every day before work if I can since my options at work are a joke. Bolt has a super friendly staff, they remember you. Order the high boltage shot. Sometimes it's made slightly different depending on the person, I like it spicy. The greena coolada is excellent and the almond smoothie is pretty god damn amazing. Beet juice is killer and the soups are always always always good. The salad bar is pretty top notch. The red head is a sweetheart and the girl with a half shaved head. Go here if u like healthy."}
{"text":"I've been there once since they have recently opened, and I do plan on making another trip. Their menu seems very bland and small, so hopefully they expand it after being open for quite some time. Initially I was intending to buy a grain bowl for dinner, but they seemed kind of \"meh\" just in terms of variety. So I opted for an acai bowl because i LOVE acai bowls. The person working there didn't seem to know exactly what she was making or doing, but she still managed to pull off a decent acai bowl. Not many places in Toronto offer them, so it was pretty good since you don't have much to compare to (unless you make your own at home of course). The acai blend was good, fruit toppings good, granola good. But nothing too spectacular. I will return to try more menu items in the future."}
{"text":"I've lived in the area my whole life and have gone to Bolt since they first opened, back when their offerings and service were great, but that was years ago.   Now, this place is just awful. They have increased their prices while decreasing the quality of their offerings. The salads/grain bowls are disgusting when you consider that the ingredients are not covered at all and the front door is open sometimes. Their stews and soups are small and not worth their price tag. The parfait is what made this place popular and I don't even like it that much since they switched out the granola mix.   Another thing to add is the customer service, it can be fine sometimes and awful at others. I was used to seeing the same people work here (back when I visited Bolt every week) but now it seems as if i'm seeing someone new every time I go in there. Are they having trouble keeping staff?   Personally, If you are looking for an alternative to Bolt and are near the Queen West or Little Portugal area I highly suggest The Goods, Veghed and The Grow-Op. These establishments will all blow Bolt out of the water."}
{"text":"Bolt is the perfect place to go when you are on a health kick. They serve vegetarian dishes only and is mainly take-out   I was feeling pretty hungry so I ordered a grain bowl instead of a salad. I had the protein bowl which was pretty good and quite filling but I wish there was less grain(brown rice) and more of  the other toppings and  miso dressing.  I decided to give Bolt a second chance.and tried an Acai bowl.Their Acai bowls are served in a cup not a bowl and they look like parfaits I had the Acai power bowl which comes with tropical fruits and is topped with whipped coconut.  This bowl did not disappoint and definitely  satisfied my sweet tooth.  I'll be back to try their smoothies next."}
{"text":"In the time of the 2016 Rio Olympics, big ups to Usain Bolt and Bolt Fresh Bar! I haven't seen the meme grace their social media channels yet, but in due time, I am sure.   I really like Bolt. From the bright interior to the easy-to-read menu, it's not as intimidating a place as one might think. Definitely take a gander at the menu before you go in though because with so much selection, it is hard to not just stand there, mouth agog, while you make your decision. In times of sickness, I have turned to Bolt for supped-up orange juices and health shots from Elxr Juice Lab. In times of health, any old smoothie will do. I especially like the Lemon Tart, which has a little bite to it from the hemp hearts, lemon zest and Royal dates. For the instagrammable showstopper, run don't walk to order an acai parfait and don't skimp on the whipped coconut cream. That's like ordering nachos without guac; it simply isn't done.   The price point kind of prevents Bolt from being a daily or weekly indulgence, like a latte or muffin from coffee shops down the street. But, you do feel like you're getting what you pay from when you see all the fresh ingredients lined up in a salad box or being churned into a bright drink.    #BOLT"}
{"text":"Their salads and bowls are incredibly filling, healthy, and delicious. The best healthy food option in the neighbourhood by far."}
{"text":"Grab a bottled drink at the back and pay for it and leave. It's the easiest and fastest way to avoid the miserable staff and their questionable food preparation methods."}
{"text":"I had a parfait, and it was ok.  The space was so cute, But that point is moot.  'Cause the service was bad, And made me so sad,  I'll never go back, 'Til they give her the sack.   So, summarize, I had a mediocre, overpriced parfait, and the woman who served me was rude and crusty. Way to live up to the Queen West service stereotype, Bolt!  Will not return."}
{"text":"I was craving for something healthy and from outside it looked good. Although my boyfriend told me not go because he didn't like it I wanted to try it anyway. But I should have listened to him... Really disappointing, I wonder how you can fail making an acaï bowl without tasting acaï. Too expensive for what it is, not worth trying. Sorry!"}
{"text":"The most miserable people on earth work here. Not sure if that was a part of the job requirement or not? Also they go back and forth handling the food and cash without using gloves. Ie: when scooping blackberries out of jar to make açai bowl. Sadly, I do enjoy the açai bowl & the location works for me."}
{"text":"A delicious juice, smoothie and salad bar. The green smoothie was a great breakfast and the berry smoothie was delicious as well. This is not for typical smoothie drinkers - it is very clean and the deliciousness reflects this."}
{"text":"Pretty solid vegan spot. Had a rice bowl there today that came with a bunch of stuff, all the ingredients seemed fresh and came together well. Simple and tasty"}
{"text":"I was taking a stroll in the neighborhood with my date and walked in to check this place out. It was the most rewarding spontaneous thing I've done in a while. They had been open only 10 minutes and I was their first customer. The staff was extremely friendly and took the time to talk to us about their products. The Armenian Lentil soup was divine. Very hearty and flavourful. I'll definitely be back to try their salads and smoothies!   Note: Not a sit down restaurant."}
{"text":"Totally great! I made my own grain bowl using quinoa, kimchee, grated carrot, grated squash, tofu and avocado, topped with carrot miso dressing.  It was super good, and with a juice/smoothie, could be split between two people for a decent sized lunch.  I recently tried the Goods on Dundas, and I didn't like it nearly as much as Bolt.  Will totally hit this up the next time I need a clean and tasty lunch!"}
{"text":"I've been scoping out this place on Instagram pretty much since this place opened. I just moved to the neighborhood and finally had a chance to check it out. So far I've had the Lemon Smoothie and Acai parfait. Both delicious but the price point is insane! 13 dollars for the acai parfait?! The optional coconut whip is 3.25, come on guys, extra guac at Chipotle is cheaper than that (actually a whole burrito is cheaper meal for meal). Pay with debit and they automatically give you the 15/18/20% tip option, even though this is not an eat in place. You have to choose 'other' and then $0.00 not to tip. Sorry but I'm not tipping on something this expensive to begin with!! 3 stars because I can't deny it's yummy but my wallet can't justify me frequenting this place with any regularity."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.   Bolt has made some recent changes and additions to their menu. One of the major changes that they've made was add onion flatbread snadwiches (these are decent, but I find 2 pieces of this flatbread too much for me because it is very oniony). They have also switched the strawberries for raspberries on one of their acai bowls (sadface - I know it's because strawberries are harder to access etc., but still sadface), and also related to the acai bowl they have changed the granola (no longer just oatmeal but also had some seeds in their, dislike...). They also recently started advertising that you can get the coconut whip to go - which is a cool and awesome option that I get sometimes. Overall, I'm not pleased w/ their changes, but am in favour of the many additions, which also include different cookies, salad and sandwich toppings, and refrigerated drinks."}
{"text":"I've been to Bolt twice now.  It's a good spot to grab a quick healthy bite.  The bowl servings are very generous.  Being a meat eater, I was still full after finishing my quinoa bowl.  The downside of this is the salsa mysteriously absorbed into my meal and left it seriously lacking taste.  I had the protein bowl the second time and the dressing + butternut squash give it more flavour - I'd recommend this if you're not making your own.  Although, it still had a very \"carby\" feel to it I often get after eating vegetarian food.  I tried the beet juice which was tasty, but a smallish serving for the price.  The best part about bolt are the acai bowls.  I've had both on the menu, and they are like a healthy dessert, although I question how many calories they have.  That's how good they are!  Bottom line is a decent, convenient spot to grab a very healthy, quick meal.  Think IQ/Kupfert/freshii but not limited to food court hours (aka no weekends)."}
{"text":"I have never thrown food out; I paid nearly $15 and threw my meal out half way through because I just couldn't tolerate the flavour anymore. The miso carrot dressing was bland but the tempeh made this meal inedible. It was sour and not in a good way. Service was poor. They charge for additional sauce. Finally, it was mentioned that they don't accept the tap function when paying with a card as they should earn tips; the tap function elongates that. That is bold to say when you are a take out spot, with no seating and terrible service. I hated my experience so much that I didn't post it in my blog as I didn't want to impact tens of thousands of people from not going here. Bad. Bad. Bad."}
{"text":"I didn't really jive with Bolt even before I was barfing my face off from drinking their juice. I ordered some green piña colada smoothie my first time and it wasn't great. I kept it in my fridge for days afterwards until it developed a composting skin because I couldn't justify throwing out a $9 juice I didn't like. Second time I order the beet and whatever else is in it juice. I am hit with the most violent food poisoning soon after. My body did not want whatever was dying inside that juice in me. I called the next day to let them know, and I was told I got sick from something else, even though it was the first thing I consumed in 14 hours...  And considering my barf looked exactly like the juice I just consumed. The red of the beets made my bathroom look like a horror movie, so at least I got a cool picture"}
{"text":"I like this place a lot! I had the lemon smoothie and a carob cookie to go and they were SOOOOOOOO good. I cannot wait to go back for an acai bowl, so excited!"}
{"text":"What a great spot for a delicious, healthy lunch and/or smoothie. Unique combinations that don't taste like every other \"healthy\" spot out there. The staff are kind and friendly. Love this joint. More of a takeout place as there's no seating (only a stand-up area where you can eat if you'd like)."}
{"text":"Bottom line: Above average, slightly-pricey healthy lunch takeout joint  Walking in Parkdale, you'd be hard pressed to take notice of Bolt.  It's unassuming without much flashy signage.  I walked by a few times before deciding to give it a go because the first few times the whirring sounds made me think they exclusively served juices/smoothies.   The closest competition I can think of is iQ Foods which also has similar packaging and food offerings.  Based on the tips here, I tried two grain bowls: 1) Quinoa Bowl and 2) Vitamin Sea Bowl.  Quinoa Bowl ($10):  This bowl contains shredded kale, green onions, parsley, avocado, tomato salsa and cherry tomatoes on a bed of quinoa.  Lots of green popping out when you open the box.  Feels very salad-y and generally quite tasty.  If you like fresh shredded kale then this is for you.  However, while it was good, it didn't have quite the flavour punch I was hoping for.  Vitamin Sea Bowl ($9): The Vitamin Sea Bowl was an interesting mix of quinoa, seaweed, carrots, a slice of avocado, a mix of kimchi, red cabbage, sesame seeds and some kelp noodles. There's a separate creamy lemon tahini sauce.  It's an interesting mix of ingredients and certainly feels very light.  The tahini sauce was slightly tart from the lemon but is quite subdued in its flavour.  The kimchi really grew on me; I felt that it was a strange addition early on but the combination of foods really hits that savoury spot.  The servings are pretty decent, though within expectations given the price. Ingredients are very fresh too.  Would visit regularly."}
{"text":"Love it!! The selection of bowls and salads isn't huge BUT you can make your own!! So that's what I did and it was perfect. The smoothie and juice lists are huge. I had the greena colada and it was amazing. Can't wait to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"Okay so Bolt is 100% hype and like 30% truth. Yes the vitamin c bowl is pretty good but honestly all of the smoothies are just okay and the other bowls and salads are also just okay. The most irksome thing though is the service, last time I was in I was unaware that the menu had been changed as it was still up where it has always been and I didn't see the inconspicuous dry erase board, aka \"the new menu\" in the shadows next to the \"old\" menu, a guy behind the counter asked my order and I began to tell him as the girl working there screams -yes, she lookied me in the eyes and yelled at me, it was very odd, there was a new menu, \"didn't I notice the NEW MENU?!\" yeah, it sucked."}
{"text":"YES! I have been waiting for a yelp page for BOLT to open up because I have been dying to review the newest addition to my neighbourhood's food scene. Surprisingly, there are not a lot of healthy/vegetarian options in WQW so when BOLT opened it was like an angel came down from the heavens above and personally blessed us with this beautiful, special and fantastic local offering.  I have inhaled everything I have ever gotten from BOLT, which almost always consists of a \"my grain\" bowl. My personal favourite is quinoa, kale, beets, carrots, tofu and avocados with the zesty green dressing. If you order this and do not love it then you need to stop trying to convince yourself that you like healthy food. This combination is perfection. Ingredients are always crisp and fresh and the staff is so nice and happy. There is nothing I dislike about this place. They're local, support local food, support local companies, and are focused on health and nutrition. It's a fantastic spot and I'm so glad it opened up just down the street from me. I have quickly become a regular.   I haven't tried the smoothies yet but I have my eyes on the Greena Colada and will make it happen sooner than later.  In conclusion, I love you BOLT. Will you marry me?"}
{"text":"The vibe: Clean, bright vegetarian take out!  The food: Juice, salads, grain bowls and all that good, clean stuff. If you've done nothing but eat poutine all winter, or are suffering from a mega hangover, or just want to feel generally fresh and alive, come here and refresh.   My go-to meal: The Vitamin Sea bowl - quinoa, kelp, seaweed, carrots, avocado and more. SO GOOD.  Secret: There are usually little juice samples out, so you can try a juice before you commit."}
{"text":"Bolt is within walking distance of The Drake Hotel (which I adored) and is great if you need your fix of green smoothies and drinks. The staff here is super friendly and I didn't get a chance to check out their solid food. What I appreciated most about BFB is their willingness to accommodate dietary needs including my allergens of coconut and almond. Might not seem like a big deal to note; however, many sites use coconut and/or almond milk and don't offer alternatives.  I was very open about it being my first time and they were so kind to walk me through their ordering process and give some insight. They also sell a particular brand of cold-pressed juices which had me craving for more as I left the city. The best one was the activated charcoal cold-pressed juice for those crazy nights you need to recover from.  When I'm back in the neighbourhood I will definitely be swinging back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love how fresh the food is. I had a strawberry, banana smoothie and a \"burrito bowl\". Delicious. Portions are decent and kept me full for a couple of hours. The environment was also welcoming and clean."}
{"text":"I've been following BOLT Fresh Bar on Instagram ever since a friend tagged them in a delicious looking smoothie.  After weeks of eye catching photo's popping up, I decided I needed to mission there for something tasty. The Acai bowl was literally the most delicious thing I've eaten in a while.  It was pricey, slightly over $10 but it was filling (it was just a mid day treat after all).  I will likely be back, when I feel like treating myself with something healthy and delicious!"}
{"text":"They forgot my shredded butternut squash in my Kelp salad. I'm very sad."}
{"text":"I never understand why take out food places automatically ask for tips (when paying with card)... if you don't have seating- and you're not leaving the conforts of behind your counter why do you feel you deserve 15%?  I tip my coffee/ tea places always- by choice (into their tip jar)- why? Because they're pleasant- they smile, listen and add to the positivity in my day.  Bolt- you were rude, when I asked a question you totally disregarded it, and there just seems to be a cloud of gloominess behind the counter- so no- you do not deserve the 15percent and I consciously will hit \"other\" and choose 0. Because you are miserable and I do not believe in rewarding negative Behaivior.  Please leave my neighbourhood to make room for another shop that brings in more pleasant staff!!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Bolt 3-4 times a week for the past month and I will not be retuning. I think the product is fantastic and prices are within reason. What is completely unacceptable is the staff member who has been repeatedly mentioned in the reviews below. For description purposes she is female, late 20's-early 30's, facial piercings and of Asian descent. Aside from my very first visit to Bolt she has been nothing but rude, condescending and I feel as though I am troubling her every time I order. I have a juice bar two doors down from me that I could go to. But I was so impressed with the quality at Bolt I continued to go there. I'm over it and it's sad to see after multiple complaints she has not changed her disposition. I know we all have bad days, but as a staff member in a public service occupation you leave your problems at home and do your job as you're a representation of a company/product."}
{"text":"Please note this review is only on the acai bowls. After living in California for a decade acai bowls became the standard grab and go breakfast item. I've never been to Brazil but I feel I have my share of solid tasty acai bowls. Now to my assessment of of Bolt's acai bowl. First I saw them pour a fruit mixture into a cup not blend a fresh array of fruit acai in a blender. Then they proceeded to top of this sludge with a pile fruit to bury this hot mess they called an acai bowl. It was liquid not frozen nor fresh and I definitely will not be going back for one at all. I give this 2 stars solely because they put a very tasty and better than the entire bowl, a coconut whip on top, that was the only good thing. If you're going for the acai please stay away but if you're having their salad bowls I'm sure they're ok as I have never tried them."}
{"text":"Not too shabby! This place is pretty good for a quick, healthy bite to eat. I've tried most of the menu items now and I'd have to say the best are the Kale Caesar and the Energy Parfaits.. oh, and the soup is always really tasty too! The Kale Caesar dressing is quite possibly the best I've had and I love that they threw some chickpeas, avocado, tempeh and grape tomatoes in there to keep things interesting. The coconut whipped cream on the parfaits is super thick and creamy. My only 'beef' with this place is that it's pretty expensive. Also, there's nowhere to sit and eat. There are a couple of high top tables that you can stand at while you chow down but a few bar stools would really go a long way. But hey, thanks for making high quality healthy grub easily accessible!"}
{"text":"Great place! Everything is fresh n great taste :) i got the Quinoa bowl with avocado n tomato salsa! Juices are good too, watermelonade, beet, carrots... Etc just pass by n you'll love it :) ah and get the \"Boltage\" shot!"}
{"text":"Entirely staffed by beautiful girls with beautiful faces that have beautiful skin, and beautiful little cherub butts (I should probably go VEGAN right? Because who DOESN'T want to look like a sexy angel...If I looked like a sexy vegan angel, I would wear short shorts all the time too, even to work. Maybe they're born with it? Maybe it's Maybelline?)  SHMANYWAYS, Bolt is straight to the point, offering healthy, wholesome to-go meals that are organic and gluten free. I grabbed a cold pressed Beet Juice, and let me just say, their Beet juice is my top 5 contender for Beet Juice's I've consumed (Number 1 Beet Juice is that one time I worked some Hippie Music Festival in BC and after the night shift of watching teenagers OD'ing on MDMA, and getting schmitty-faced drunk, Mama needed a refreshing Beet Juice to cleanse her palette. That Beet juice was historical and I fantasize about it to this day)   SO YEA, Bolt has a nice Beet Juice. But possibly not the best ever Beet Juice. I also got their vegan curry on Quinoa, it was hearty and a great filling portion, the curry could have done with a touch more seasoning and it was missing something in terms of flavor, but it hit the spot nonetheless.   My main bish and I initially came here because their Acai Bowl looked like a dish of the gods, it was so intricately beautiful in instagram photos on the official Bolt page that we though it must taste like the food of gods. But we were mistaken, looks were deceiving and the acai bowl (which actually comes in a cup? huh?) was pretty bland and our feelings can be summed as such ¯\_(?)_/¯  Points for feeling REALLY healthy while eating the whole thing."}
{"text":"I really do love Bolt Fresh Bar. I've gone there a few times but didn't notice how expensive the parfait is esp the coconut whipped cream. $14 for a parfait?not going to be coming back for that anymore sadly. Parfait is small for that price and coconut whipped cream is to expensive for the small amount they give you."}
{"text":"Loved the smoothie & salad. The people serving could be more friendlier but I guess that's how they are. Ah well."}
{"text":"I went here once to get the protein bowl and it was pretty dry. I'd rather eat cholesterol out of a bowl if this is eating healthy to me. I want to go back and try the smoothies."}
{"text":"I love the concept of Bolt -- with their offerings of fresh, healthy smoothies, juices and meals -- and even their website, with its bright orange background and round, cheerful font makes me want to be happier and healthier.  Unfortunately, the food didn't make me so happy. I stopped in to try the Protein bowl, a brown rice bowl (somewhat similar to Fresh's bowl offerings) with cherry tomatoes, marinated tofu, sprouts, beans, butternut squash, pepitas and carrot miso dressing. Everything is served to-go, so the components of the bowl were assembled in a takeout container and the dressing is served in a plastic cup within. For $9, the serving is generous -- possibly enough for two full meals, depending on your appetite. I found it to taste overwhelmingly of ginger, although I wasn't quite sure why, and the sauce seemed to disappear completely and be absorbed into the components without adding any enhancement of flavour. The more I ate, the less I liked it, and I couldn't bring myself to finish it even though I still felt hungry.   On the positive side, the space inside is beautiful, and staff were very friendly. In addition to their menu items they also seem to sell drinks like kombucha, coconut water and some sort of kefir, as well as Chocosol chocolate. There appeared to be a few high-top tables inside, but no chairs, so perhaps not an ideal place to sit and linger. It's a bummer that there aren't any seating options inside, as I feel somewhat strange eating all this healthy food while producing so much unnecessary waste.  I might come back to try one of their juice or smoothie offerings, but I'll skip the grain bowl next time and get my meal elsewhere."}
{"text":"I love their salads and salad dressings and the discount if you're a Float member. The reason I've given 2 stars is the customer service. I've gotten served by a different employee every time I've gone and they've all been miserable. No one who has served me has ever smiled or made eye contact and seems bothered. Tough life."}
{"text":"Healthy, but my taste buds didn't \"sing\". Food was a little bland. Their smoothies are good."}
{"text":"Stopped in to try their acai parfaits.  PRO - the young lady behind the counter on this particular Thursday night was nice and friendly  CONS - the two items we ordered (the energy parfait and power parfait) were both meh at best - the whipped coconut cream add-on was OK but for $2.50?? - pricey (the bill for two parfaits came out to $24)"}
{"text":"Paying $7.50 for fresh pressed juice is not for everyone.   If you asked me six years ago if I would add this to my usual routine, I would have laughed you out of the room. However, things change and I am a convert. Do I have time to go to the market regularly for fresh produce? Would I pay money to have someone else clean out my darn juicer? Basically, I've just deemed the health-giving goodness at Bolt worth the price tag.   In the warmer months, I'm all about their Green Pineapple juice and in the winter months they usually bring the heat with their vegan soups."}
