{"text":"I am so glad this place exists. This is the real authentic taste of Chinese noodles. I only tried the cold noodles, loved it and will be back to try the other noodle dishes. The owners were warm and friendly. It's a cute little corner shop, with metal tables and stools, chopsticks standing in a utensil holder by the side along with chilli oils, vinegar and other condiments."}
{"text":"One of my fave Chinese restaurants in the city.... authentic and good with a nice price tag... Will always come back!"}
{"text":"Was in Chinatown today and saw pastor from church and his kids who just had lunch there and figured I'd try it out. Tried a beef Chinese burger and well I was pretty disappointed. They only take cash and on top of that they charge tax also they don't bother to top up their till to make sure customers get their change back...

Burger kinda tastes like a Jamaican patty, it's also the size of one. For 5 bucks (which is what I paid minus the nickelback buddy gave me) you're better off going to the viet sub place at the entrance. The \"burger\" was nothing more than an expensive snack. I thought a burger from five guys was expensive but I take that back now."}
{"text":"Dropped by for a quick bite during lunch in Chinatown (open despite what Yelp says). The Chinese pancake (?) itself was good enough with the nice crunchiness inside, but it was a little weird with cumin lamb. Might be an issue of personal taste though. Service was stellar - the owners were extremely welcoming and helpful after a busy lunch hour - and deserves +1 star."}
{"text":"Auntie's Chinese Burger is my boyfriend's and my favourite chinese diner in Calgary. Their food is simply delicious and for those of you that complain about the food being too expensive, I do not understand how much cheaper do you expect them to be. We've been there at least a dozen time and each time our friends and families come to Calgary, we would make sure to bring them here. What makes this place such an excellent place to eat is the excellent customer service offered by their staffs. They always make us feel welcome no matter how busy they are. Furthermore, they are willing to improve their menu and take the time to listen to their customer's opinions. This make us feel valued and appreciated. There is nothing bad I can say about Auntie's Chinese Burger, will definitely visit on a regular basis. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great little spot with awesome noodles and other authentic northern Chinese delights. I hear they are moving location soon so perhaps phone ahead to make sure you end up in the right spot."}
{"text":"I think it is too bad and too expensive, it is located in the building, and one Chinese hamburger is so small with $4.95? And one iced noodle is so bad taste with 6.95?"}
{"text":"Such a cute space! They sell old fashioned chinese crepes which you can't buy ANYWHERE else in Calgary and they are super authentic - ask for more sauce and an extra egg for the real deal. I think these crepes are better than any of the savoury Western types I've had. They make them with mung bean flour and they come out crisp and hot in a generous portion for around $5."}
{"text":"Maaaan, Auntie's Chinese Burger has been on my Calgary list of eats for awhile. Last time I was in town, we tried to go but was devastated to find out they were closed during a holiday. Lesson learned - always call during holidays, even if it's on a Monday. Well, I was determined to make it out on my most recent trip, even if I had to go by myself. In a nutshell, this is Calgary's equivalent to Edmonton's Noodle Feast. I had to see myself whether Auntie's Chinese Burger would be on/up to par.

I got dropped off Friday afternoon (around 3:30pm) and it was empty. A couple came in after me but that was it for clientele. Their hours are pretty short (11am - 7pm everyday except Sunday) so they must mainly get the lunch crowd. The lady working the front greeted me and both workers (think it's a husband/wife combo) are super friendly and gentile. There is hot tea and water up at the front but it's more of a help yourself kind of a deal (aka. don't be shy).

The \"restaurant\" (better described as a hole in the wall) is inside the Far East shopping centre, which also houses Trung Nguyen (banh mi/BBT) and some other typical Asian stores. Inside, there is a TV playing random Asian shows (some robot was throwing basketballs into a net while I was there). The menu is pretty straightforward - noodles and Chinese burgers (hence their name). Noodles in all their glory - cold noodles, noodles in soup and hand pulled noodles (My FAV)!

- Handmade B.B. noodles with lamb (#25) ($11.99) - being only one person is hard (not getting to try multiple dishes always make me sad) but I decided to make the most of it and went with their handmade noodles. These were awesome! Nice flat, wide noodles with a great chewy texture. The cumin spice mixture is just right and they added in some chili oil to give some heat to the dish. A couple bok choy and small bites of lamb rounded things out. If I had one complaint, it'd be that there wasn't enough lamb in the dish - you had to dig around to find a few piece here and there.

CASH only but you should already know that about Chinatown by now. Can't wait to come back again to try their cold noodles and soup noodle dishes. If you want real northern Chinese food, check out Auntie's, I know I'll be back. One dish and I know this place is legit."}
{"text":"Despite its name being Auntie's Chinese Burger, it was their noodles that won me over. (Have I ever mentioned that I'm a noodles/pasta lover??)

We ordered the pork burger combo (comes with a smaller sized cold noodles and homemade soup) and the handmade B.B. noodles. The pork burger was alright, and didn't do anything for me. It was ok, but maybe next time I'll go with another meat choice to see if it changes my mind on the burger.

The cold noodles are very appetizing and refreshing. My friend told me that when she comes to the restaurant with a group of friends, the cold noodles is always ordered as an appetizer for everyone to share. I can see why, it has that ability to get your appetite stirring (my analogy to this cold noodles is like the seaweed salad you get at Japanese restaurants). Though keep in mind for those who can't handle spice, this has a nice flavourful kick to it. I would definitely recommend it as an appetizer or for a refreshing meal on a hot summer's day.

The handmade B.B. noodles was a second favourite. The handmade factor was easily noted as the texture was chewy and had a \"elastic-y\" feel to it. Long wide strands of noodles was available, and even though my first impression of the bowl was \"this isn't enough!\", I quickly realized how filling it was, as I began to have trouble finishing it at the end of the meal. Once again, because this restaurant specializes in Northern China cuisine, this dish is spicy as well.

Tip: Make sure you tell them little spice if you can't handle spiciness. China spice is very different from North American spice. A little spice here does a lot of damage.

Another thing to note is that this place is CASH only. Not even debit is accepted. Good thing for me, I found an ATM machine in the same building."}
{"text":"ok ok - more description would help, I'm sure. thankfully I've been back to Auntie's twice since my last review, so I've got more to review. 
I have only tried the Beef burgers (also available in pork & lamb) and they are amazing. the beef is tender and perfectly seasoned with cumin. the cilantro compliments everything so well. the bun is always crispy. 
yesterday I got combo #2, 'the beef combo', and for $7.99 It came with beef soup, cold spicy noodles, a beef burger, and a cute little dish of cantelope. all of it was delicious. the cold noodles had a little kick which was a nice surprise.
service is great, the little cafe is great, it's all just really great. except for the cash only part because I always forget that part. but whatever."}
