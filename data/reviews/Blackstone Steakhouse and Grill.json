{"text":"Everything about this family owned restaurant is perfect. We arrived before the restaurant opened but the owner was nice enough to welcome us in. He personally prepared the food and explained how to cook the steak on the lava stone with various sauces to create different unique tastes. The food was utmost delicious. We were impressed by his passion towards culinary. The overall experience at this steakhouse was A+!"}
{"text":"Everything on this menu was incredible!!!  It's a new restaurant and the chef is a passionate cook.  Huge portions, reasonable prices and amazing food.  The variety of dishes amazed me. Of course, their steak was the highlight.  Their pulled jerk beef nachos were incredible.  This is a hidden gem, but won't be for long."}
{"text":"Very friendly and good was surprisingly good for a new restaurant. The staff was accommodating and polite, the food is unique, tasty, and it was a great dining experience overall. Recommended !"}
{"text":"Staff very friendly (owner seems strict), but steak and veggies were bland/unseasoned and way too hot to cut table-side. Hot oil and juices were spewing out from the steak and burning my hands."}
{"text":"This place has delicious entrees on its menu. I had ribs which were succulent! 

Next time i am going to try lamb shank! 

Exceptional service. The owner and the staff are very friendly. They even celebrated my birthday!"}
{"text":"After hearing a lot of good things about this place, I decided to try it myself. The owner was welcoming and explained about all the choices... Amongst the three of us, we ordered two sirloin and one grilled Herb chicken. Both the steak were delicious, by far the best in Mississauga, and I've been around. The concept of the black stones actually turned out to be an experience you don't want to miss. The steak cooked perfectly on the stone, and stayed tender and hot 'til the last bite. I saved a few bites to take home, and warmed it up the next morning. The meat was still succulent. Amazing! Have to mention the arty presentation, all put together beautifully. My cousin, who's B-day we were celebrating, ordered the chicken and really enjoyed it. To finish off a wonderful evening, the owner brought a delicious slice of cheesecake, complimentary, for the b-day girl. Definitely recommend going to this place, and looking forward to my next trip. Thanks Simran."}
{"text":"Amazing steak served on a hot stone cooked right in front of you. Incredible prices and great options. One of thw best steaks I've ever had."}
{"text":"Upon arrival the waitress seemed confused if we had a reservation. Anyways we did and we were seated promptly.

Complimentary bread: It was stale and would crumble when picked up. It even had small pieces of wrapper on it. When asked to replace it, the lady pulled her face and was clearly ticked off.

We had to flag down a waiter to take our order. We waited around 30mins and still no starters. Other customers that arrived after us were getting there food before us. I had to speak to the guy behind the counter twice requesting where is my food.  

We ordered, nachos with chicken, fish and chips, chicken, beef short ribs and 2 rib eye 12oz steaks.

Nachos were sour. Did not enjoy them at all.

The fish&chips and beef short ribs had the same sauce spread on it which was a sweet sauce. Who eats sweet fish and chips? Ewwww

The 2 rib eyes were OKAY. You can tell the quality of the meat is LOW. It was chewy to say the least. Not flavorful and overall just not tasty and enjoyable.  My steak was medium. 

The chicken was good. Juicy and tender hence why i gave this review 2 stars.

Presentation for all items were good. But that's about it.

The service was horrible. Steak was off poor quality,  and we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner for two (triple A sirloin with mashed potatoes and tenderloin with Caesar salad; both with grilled vegetables as accompaniments). The food quality was very good. Perfect portion size and good value. Flavours were on point and service was friendly and attentive. You could tell that the staff was eager to please. Ambience is average but perfectly acceptable if you are not fussy. Be prepared to come out smelling like steak! The smoke from the sizzling meat on lava stone cannot be avoided but is not a tremendous concern. I will gladly return to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Delicious food, had Caribbean chicken, perfect spices inside chicken and rice so tasty, and well cooked. Definitely great customer service."}
{"text":"Always make reservations as this place, it  gets so busy on weekends. Love this place the food and people who work here. I do recommend this on special days or any day!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, staff was very welcoming! I wish all restaurants treated their patrons like that.  Only negative would be the lack of alcohol."}
{"text":"This has become my favorite halal steakhouse in just one visit. 

Small cozy location with excellent menu and affordable prices, service is great. We tried the special Lamb shank and rib eye steak. Food and presentation was excellent. Steak was tender, moist and fresh, sauces were unique and complimented the meal. 

Overall, I would highly recommend"}
{"text":"I went here last night for dinner with my husband. I was not expecting the ambiance to be super nice as I had previously read the reviews. So I walked in around 9:30, it was extremely busy and defiantly not romantic place. 
The host was very accommodating and was trying to find us a spacious place as we had a car seat with us. We sat in a temporary place as we waited for our table to be cleaned. In the meantime,we had a look at the menu and decided to order the blackstone salad, calamari, ribs, and 16 oz rib eye. For drinks, we ordered the sparking champagne and Shirley temple. 
We placed the order with one of the servers, then we waited to be seated. It was about twenty minutes and we were still in the same spot and were not brought anything. Then I asked one of the servers since we had no server assigned to us to move us to the table the host had said we would be seated at. Then he went and asked the host who said he will clean the other table up and apologized. While waiting for a different table, a different server sat us in the middle as it was already cleaned. Then we sat there and waited once again. An hour of being there, we had not had anything served to us nor our drinks. We were a little irritated then a server came and i asked him what is happening as we have been waiting for so long and are very hungry. He said he will go check on it, again we waited and I called the server to bring us our appetizer at least. He said he will go check on it again, I asked him is there anything we can have in the men's time and our drinks. So he then brought us bread with butter and the drinks. He finally rushed the order and told us that we are first priority as it was super late and we needed to eat. 
We received our appetizers (calamari and salad) which was amazing. And shortly after, the host came back to tell us they did not have the ribs but will give us steak on house. We were fine with that. We got our entrees shortly after that, which again was really good. The food was amazing and I loved the fact that you can cook your steak to your desired taste !
The food was great and the service was amazing. My husband paid for the meal even though they offered for it to be on house as we appreciated the staff and them taking the extra mile to better our experience. This restaurant has a very good potential but needs improvement on the restaurant operation and organization. Also, their location is small and washrooms are shared with other buildings."}
{"text":"So for a place that charges $28 dollars for steak, you'd expect better interior and that's why I gave it three stars. As soon as you walk in, you think \"that's it?\" The place is fairly small. The interior definitely  needed a face lift (although it recently just opened?) the paint on the walls was chipped, the lighting was dim and mirrors were dirty. The washrooms are outside of the restaurant and is possibly a shared bathroom with the other few stores around it, however, it's relatively clean. 

Now when it comes to the food, the steaks were great! AAA grade cut, tender and juicy. I loved how it came out on a lava stone so you can cook it to your liking, however I was wearing leather pants and the oil from the sizzling  lava stone splattered all over them so you can see the oil stains as I left the place. My order came with veggies and mashed potatoes.. veggies were delicious but the mashed potatoes were bland.. my husband got the fried and he couldn't stop raving about how delicious they were.."}
{"text":"Small Place in the corner. They do really pretty lights! You wont feel the FINE DINE but it will get there when the food arrives. The food -- just pure incredible. Had the AAA RibEye 16oz Steak -- took 1 small bite and i knew I am going to love this place. It was packed with flavour. It comes with a Super Hot plate. The Chef gives you a Blue steak -- you can either put the whole steak on the plate or cut pieces of it and cook to the level you desire. its Brilliant and its gives the customer something to do and be active with their food. really liked the owner/chef -- he explained what the dish was and recommended items and even explained how the veggies are different because of different seasons and so on. 100% going to be back to try the rest Price range: $7 - $35 (lowest price item to highest)"}
{"text":"Debated a long time yesterday how many stars to give Blackstone, but after today's discussion with my family where we again complained about the faults of yesterday's dinner, I decided that two stars was the right rating. This was due to two reasons: the poor cuts of beef and the bad managerial decision.

Steak:
We ordered one of each steak cut: the tenderloin, sirloin, and the rib eye. The 8oz tenderloin was well executed and the highlight of the night. The cut was tender and juicy. However, it went downhill from there. The sirloin and the rib eye were far too tough and chewy. There were literal pieces of tendon dispersed throughout the cut, which made chewing very difficult. It wasn't particularly flavourful either. The steaks were impressive merely due to the lava stones upon which they were served; they were otherwise a disappointment. 
My dad also ordered the lamb shank, a pitiful piece of mush that came drowning in an overly sickening sweet BBQ sauce. There was absolutely no flavour whatsoever; it was an overdone, overbraised lamb. That said, I suppose we were at fault for ordering something other than steak at a steakhouse.

Service:
We came to celebrate my sister's birthday; I had called in advance to let then know and asked whether there would be any dessert or celebration. The manager had mentioned that they could bring a cake with a birthday song and decorate it nicely - just to let him know upon arrival. I did just that, but decided to confirm whether the celebration would be on the house. He said that it wouldn't be, which is totally fine, so I told him that I'd reconsider and let him know later. Halfway during the meal, he walks by with a pat on my shoulder, assuring me that he \"will take care of it\". From that, I assumed that he decided to provide the cake on the house, and was delighted. You can imagine my shock when I see the $8 charge on the bill at the end! While the celebration was a nice gesture, I never explicitly asked for it. That was because I didn't feel that a measly small piece of cake was worth $8, no matter how good. For him to make a decision on my behalf - the customer's behalf - is simply unacceptable.
The servers, though friendly, had difficulties understanding our order. The sides for the steak were switched, so we had to go through the trouble of righting their mistakes. Moreover, they just kept checking in on us, which almost felt as if they were breathing down our necks a bit. It was slightly pushy and overwhelming. 
Finally, the table space was very tight. There was simply insufficient room for all the plates and stones. However, despite our raising of this point, they simply dismissed it. The cramped table simple made dining there uncomfortable.

Conclusion:
If you're craving a good steak, I would not choose this place. If you're interested in the experience of the lava stone, then sure, come and try. I won't come again only because I feel that we were ripped off with the sudden charge and delivery of the birthday cake."}
{"text":"The theme behind this place is they brown your steak and bring it out on a 400 to 500 degree(fahrenheit) stone. Its medium rare in the center and you cook it how you like on that stone. Seasonal veggies and your choice of fries or mashed potaters OR a salad(like anyone is gonna order that). Server was very kind and helpful although he is vegetarian. Go try this place you cannot beat the concept and the food itself. 

P.s. we had american notes and they wouldnt do the conversion, instead they said you can pay USD without the conversion which would have been like 15 bucks more CAD, i did not want to downgrade the review since the service and food was top notch but i should mention if you have USD just use a card."}
{"text":"I brought my son here for dinner on a Wednesday night in February. The staff were very warm and friendly, and went out of their way to be kind to my son as well. He had a Shirley Temple and Bolognese- the portion was huge and he was able to bring some home for his lunch the next day. I had a special- crispy fish with a sweet and spicy sauce, mashed potatoes and perfectly cooked vegetables. The meal was absolutely delicious and I've thought about it many times since. We had a chocolate cake for dessert that was to die for. 
Can't wait to return with friends!"}
{"text":"Love this new halal steakhouse.  I ordered the lamb shank and it was excellent very moist and flavourful.

My friend ordered the steak with fries and very well presented and delicious.
The service was fast and friendly. The portions were perfect and price was comparable to other steakhouses.  The ambiance was lacking, cheap chairs and tables.  I'll be going back for the amazing food"}
{"text":"For steak lovers this is the perfect place for you, the steak comes on a sizzling lava stone. The steak comes medium rare and you can cook it to your liking on lava stone. I got the mashed potatoes and seasonal vegetables with mine, everything tasted so good. Our waiter, Simran was also very courteous and knowledgeable in all the questions we had. You can tell this place spends some time to ensure their staff has good customer service skills. Great place!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Well priced. We had an issue with the Nachos being cold and the staff immediately responded to our concern and brought out a different appetizer.  These guys really seem focused on customer experience and they have a well thought out menu.  The only pointer I would have for anyone coming in is to avoid wearing clothes that are white or maybe very expensive as some of the sizzle off the stone (yummm!) tends to land on you. But that is the sort of problem I love to have :)"}
{"text":"I was thoroughly impressed with the food here. It was done just right. We came to break our fast during Ramadan and they provided drinks and a few plates of complimentary dates and other items before we got our main dishes. 

Speaking of main dishes. I got the Carribean chicken and it was just perfect. The chicken was so moist and came with three sauces on the side, roasted veggies and another side of your choice. My husband got the steak and that was an experience on its own. They bring the steak on a blackstone pretty rare, immediately tell you to remove it and put it on your plate and then you can slice and cook your meat on the stone itself to your liking. The stone comes out between 350-400°-it's like an oven! The quality of the steak was good as well. 

We also got the jerk nachos for appetizers. This is probably the best thing we had that night! It's a must try. Definitely will be coming back again to try other items. 

The only downside was the place was small and in a corner of the plaza (a bit hard to find)."}
{"text":"Unexpected find. The chef is very gracious  and accommodated all our needs. So unique with the hot lava rock grilling the steak to personal choice.  The steaks are amazing quality. The chimmichuri sauce is the perfect foil to the perfectly cooked steaks. Amazing service and delicious food. Will come many more times!!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing ,owner was kind enough to accommodate our larger group near closing time ."}
{"text":"Blackstone is a fairly new steakhouse in the GTA and we went during opening week. We had made reservations early for my birthday for a party of 6 with 2 kids - everything was set and ready for us when we arrived. 

The chef specifically came out to welcome us and explain the menu. He mentioned that it wasn't their set menu as they hope to have more items on the menu in the next few weeks. He had bought us fresh bread with oil to munch on as we waited for the rest of our friends. 

I ended up getting the steak on a lava stone which was deliciously marinated and served with a compound butter, mushroom sauce, and a grainy spread. Additionally, I received a side of mashed potatoes, veggies as well as a complimentary ceaser salad. Each item was super flavorful, and tasted very high end in my opinion. My only concern were the veggies that tasted a little bland - otherwise everything else was amazing. 

I also had dessert which was the crème brulee - I think this is something they can improve on as it tasted 'eggy' but the dinner was so good that I didn't even care about the dessert.

Overall the food, service and ambiance of Blackstone was superb. I would recommend this steak over Affy's and Crave Grill House. It's actually on another level with all of the additional sauces it comes with as well as the marination of the steak itself. I understand that cooking your own steak may not be appetizing for some but that's part of the experience which for my group of friends, we really enjoyed."}
{"text":"Solid steak. And presentation is very good. Also halal. They provide the steak on a hot cooking stone which is neat and not something I've not seen elsewhere. Thwy provide the strak medium rare and you can cook to your liking. The place itself is a little weird located in a corner of a  plaza. It's a pretty small place with maybe 6 or 8 tables and not the greatest setup. Anyway the service was pretty decent and the servers were very nice. My wife  got the jerk  chicken and didn't like it saying it tasted like chicke  curry rather than jerk. Id say stick to the steak."}
{"text":"There are very limited potions for Halal steak houses so I had to try it out. First 2 times I tried reserving a table I was once told the food had finished and the second time The steak house is definelty not fine dining.  The menu is limited but good enough.  The portions are very good for the price. The burgers and pasta was really good and my kids loved them.  The ribs were good and I would say the beat halal ribs we have had.  The steak experience is unique where you are cooking the steak ureself. The steak was not good though as it was too chewy. Would come back but not get the steak. The service was good.  Helping were big and definelty worth the money."}
{"text":"The reservation was made a day before with time for coming in specified. The lady receiving us had no time recorded and falsely statexd she called us three times. Then made us wait. Horrible place."}
{"text":"My family of nine went down for dinner and all had something different ; it was all Amazing!!! 
Steaks , Ribs , Pasta , shrimp was absolutely delicious and plate presentation was excellent! 
Staff / our server Simran was way above average , 
Quality stuff man!!! 

Will definitely be back and recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"This was a great little find.  The owner told us that they were completely full because fasting ending & people were coming in.  But she graciously found us a table and served us with grace and the utmost attention.  

Boy...... everything was delish.  The steak is brought out on hot stone and you are able to cook it to the wellness that you desire.  

Everything was appropriately priced also!"}
{"text":"I typically only leave comments for either really good places or really bad places and this is definitely the former. I was in town here with some family and we decided to try this place. I'm from vegas, we have a lot of celebrity chef restaurants and great steakhouses. I hold no reservations about this place. It's tucked away in a corner, the ambiance is great for families or just a date. The service was excellent. The food came out in a timely manner and was delicious. Pretty much everyone got the steak prepared on the lava stone which was not only aesthetically pleasing but also lets you cook it for as long or short as you want. The sides were fresh and complimented the steak perfectly. The desert was a rich cheese cake topped with coconut shaving. Overall this was one of the better steakhouses that I've been to and would recommend this to anyone in the area, you won't be disappointed. Thanks to the chef as well who came and checked on us throughout the night to make sure we had everything we needed. A+"}
{"text":"Halal meat is served here per signs on restaurant and owners are known Muslims. Had the Jerk chicken Nachos appetizer (good), Pina Colada drink (pretty good) and the 16 oz Rib Eye Steak cooked medium rare on hot stone with veggies and mash on the side. Everything tasted very good! Meat was tender and juicy and marinated well. Friendly service. Quality food. Reasonable Prices. Interior of restaurant is on small size. Atmosphere looks more like a fast food joint than fine dining but I'm sure they will improve interior decor of restaurant eventually. Overall was a good experience and I hope to visit again next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Went today for lunch. Delicious steak. Well seasoned. We got the sirloin. Short rib was sooo good! Melt in your mouth meat! I would go for the mashed potatoes over the fries. The service is nice as well. Chef came out to ask how our meal was. The only thing is the restaurant is hard to spot in the complex because the sign is dark. Also the ambiance is so so but the presentation of the food, the food itself, and the service is good which is what matters most."}
{"text":"Ok so hear me out, I've been to many many steak houses across many continents. 
This place is tucked away in Mississauga and serves it's steak  on a black stone. The steak was perfectly cooked, tasted amazing!. 
On top of that, service was excellent!!!!!!!
Shout out to simran for his positivity!!! It was contagious!"}
{"text":"Amazing steak. One of the best in GTA. Will come soon again whenever have the opportunity"}
{"text":"Greetings!!! Here in Canada for the 1st time with great friends. Went here and we had the 16oz steak. They prepared the food on a hot stone which was awesome!! Great little hidden gem nestle in a corner.  Definitely would recommend and visit again.  Customer Service was great!!! We really enjoyed our steak which was absolutely amazing!!"}
{"text":"Best. Steak. Ever. Period. Juicy, tender, sizzling. Sauces are to die for. And the whole experience is one you won't find anywhere else in the GTA. The blackstone lets you cook it just as much or as little as you want. They have plenty of other items on the menu that are equally delicious! Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"It would be a mistake to judge this restaurant by its modest decor. This is an awesome steakhouse!! The steak on a lava stone is absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"The food here was remarakably good. Me and my friend ordered Jerk Chicken Nachos and Short Ribs. The Jerk Chicken Nachos were one of the greatest things I have ever eaten, explosive in flavour and in a large serving size - these could be a meal by themselves! The short ribs were also quite good, they were very soft, well seasoned, and had tons of flavour. 

In terms of service the two waitresses that greeted us were kind, quick, organized and assisted us immediately. Comedically the only odd experience here occurred at the end. When we requested the bill and asked to split it; an older waitress dropped by and split it based on the meals (she assumed one guy is paying for nachos, and the other for the short ribs...). We then politely told her that we meant split evenly amongst us (I thought this was the default universal standard when someone says split the bill??). She then pretty much got agitated and did not seem happy, and even went to say angrily \"You guys said split the bill\". Nonetheless, at that point she corrected the mistake and we parted ways.


The experience was so positive that the silly blunder near the end can be overlooked. I would definitely recommend this place to others, the cost was also very reasonable."}
{"text":"Had heard a lot of great things about this place, but we were disappointed. Think maybe we caught them at a wrong moment, as they had a pretty full restaurant when we went on a Wednesday night at 7:30 PM for a date night - there was at least two big groups there, 1 large family having a birthday party, and 1 very big group of friends. 

Walking in, we were not impressed by the decor (lights are great, but they definitely need new furniture); however, we were keeping an open mind. We were greeted by several very friendly servers and hosts, and seated quickly and made to feel very welcome. A+ here. 

Looking at the menu, we were thrilled - seems like there is a chef with a vision behind this enterprise. We were talking about how the decor doesn't align with what the restaurant seems like it's trying to be, which is upscale, but the menu looks amazing, so at this point in time, we were super optimistic and excited.  

However, after this, it went downhill. We both ordered steak, as that's what we were there for (tenderloin and sirloin); we were told the kitchen was out of bone marrow as a topping, but no matter. Still excited for our steaks. Oh, they don't actually have any of the non-alcoholic specialty drinks that are on their menu. Fine, sure, no problem, I am here for steak. How do I want my steak? Medium rare. 

We got our steaks and they were not medium rare. They were medium-well. Also, we weren't told how to use the black stone - and that we are supposed to take the steaks off the stone right away, and put it on the wooden plate and eat it off there. We started eating and our steak kept cooking more. When the server came back to check on us, he realized our steak had been cooking on the stone for that whole time, and told us we were supposed to take it off. The result? Well-done steak. Like any other Muslim steak restaurant. 

He apologized a lot for forgetting about us, and took responsibility for this error; however, we still left disappointed ($70 for a meal that we didn't enjoy).  

Tips for the owners if you want to improve: 
- Definitely update the interior decor - the furniture looks cheap, and doesn't go with the vibe  
- Maybe just have 1 person taking care of you all night, as we had at least 3 different people greeting us, seating us, telling us the menu options, and serving us, and we felt like maybe we got lost in this shuffle, as they each thought the others were taking care of us
- This is a personal quirk of mine, but I don't like seeing children working; I understand it may be a family-run business 
- Don't ask us how we want our steak if then we have to cook it ourselves. Why did you ask what level of doneness if we want? Don't assume we have been there before. Please just explain from the beginning that we can cook it ourselves on the black stone. 
- Tied to this: explain how the black stone grilling process works right as the food comes out!!!!! Don't keep the clients waiting, as their steak will cook to a level of doneness that they do not want if you forget them about for even 5 minutes. 
- Have just 1 stone in the middle for 2 people if they're a couple, as otherwise the small table gets too crowded with the big wooden platters for two, drinks for two, and more if the two people have ordered another drink or appetizer - we were told they could've pushed a second table to join with our table to give us more space, if we had asked, but why do we have to ask? Isn't it your job to be clearing the table? 

Will come back eventually in a few months to see if it has changed."}
{"text":"I loved the experience of cooking my own steak the way I wanted at the table. I know that sounds funny because you're probably thinking \"why not just do it at home\" But it cooks extremely fast on the lava stone which is heated to 270 degrees celsius. But if you wanted the chef could cook it for you. It's paired with these delicious sauces that the chef made in-house: Argentinian chimichurri, compound butter and a mushroom sauce. I paired mine with the vegetables and mashed potatoes. 28

The mashed potatoes were fairly bland so I got extra sauce for them which helped. I also didn't like the Caesar salad at all - please don't put meat on it.. tasted so odd."}
{"text":"Small restaurant tucked away in a Mississauga strip mall serving great food. This a true gem and a great find. 

We made reservations 4 weeks in advance as we had 6 people dining.   The place was packed while we were there. We saw many others turned away so make sure to make reservations. 

We arrived and were greeted with a warm hi then promptly led to our table. 

Restaurant: on the small to medium side, nice ambiance and quite busy BUT not chaotic. These people obviously knew what they were doing.  You could see the chefs preparing your meals. 

Food: incredible and unique experience!!!  Our steaks were actually served on a sizzling \"blackstone\". We had mashed potatoes, side vegetables and three sauces on the side of the cutting board.

Service: excellent!!  Sarah was great and so were the other employees. The staff seemed well trained in customer service and if they didn't have the answers, they'd ask for you. 

Our food all arrived at the same time and not issues. We had a total of 9 dished including appetizers and some picky eaters with some exactly requests: we were accommodated and had no issues with our orders. 

Price: excellent for the quality of service and the meal. 

Have definitely told others about this place and will definitely be coming here again."}
{"text":"A great fine Halal dining experience! Our waiter Simran was one of the kindest most patient waiters I've ever had. He did an amazing job of explaining the menu and helping us decide which meal to get. I chose the daily special, Habanero Chicken and I ordered Tiger Shrimp on the side. I was expecting for the wait to be quite some time considering the intricacy of the entree and plating. I was SUPER impressed when all 10+ of the people with my got their meals in under 15 minutes. The chicken was amazing as was the shrimp. It was one of those meals that makes you stop talking to your friends and focussing all your attention on the meal itself. The presentation for everything was beautiful, especially the steaks that I will surely try out next time. Only downsides are that the restaurant was hard to find with the vertical sign outside. The inside isn't so roomy and you might slip on the vinyl wood floors."}
{"text":"This is the best, steak experience I've had. I've had my fair share of halal steaks at Affy's, upscale places like Ruth Chris Stake House (yes the down town location has a halal stake), CN Tower 360 restaurant and Blackstone is the best I've ever had. The location interior is OK (not as fancy as other steak houses) but wait till the steak comes, you'll be blown away. The whole experience of cooking your own steak I've never done."}
