{"text":"I really don't suggest anyone to give pickle barrel markville a chance. After shopping, my friend and I decided to go despite terrible reviews.  I can honestly say, I've never written ill of a restuarant but this is totally ridiculous.  We walked in and was seated promptly. The server came and ask if we wanted to start off with a drink. We said we need a couple of minutes to decide. The waitress came back in about 15 minute. She finally took our orders, I ordered a beet salad and I had one adjustment to the salad I wanted to order. I asked if I could have it with salmon rather than chicken.  She said she would have to ask the manager first, that was another 15 mins. We came back and said the adjustment was possible but onky $3 extra. Surely, she would come out with a salad looking like this....   Lettuce were huge and not cut and there were still skin on the beets. To whom this may concern, if you fail at making salad, you may need to consider other profession."}
{"text":"Should have listened to some of the reviews for this location.  Both service and food was pretty bad today.  I generally don't like to give businesses bad reviews.   Some people just have bad days.  Some of the drinks we ordered were watered down.  The pasta was lacking meat. The nacho had sauce but missing the meat.   The steaks were over cooked.  We also ordered the dessert sampler tray which (the cheese cake one was awful) was so so.    I don't know what to say... even though I came out of dinner pretty full,  I was not too pleased.  If my friend didn't share her food with me, I would've been pretty hungry.  Lol  Will I come back... I have to say no.  This is actually not my first time here.  But it is my first time in 4 maybe 5 years.  I guess the majority of the reviews on Yelp is pretty accurate when it comes to this particular location."}
{"text":"I love the salmon and the sweet potato fries. Their French toast and bacon is good.    Their is always a long line up close to any meal time.  The service is only average... I like the renovated decor which was done a few years ago. But I go back for the Rose Resiman salmon... only 500 calories and delicious."}
{"text":"Ordered here maybe two weeks ago through Uber Eats app and was very disappointed. On the app, the pasta that i usually order when i dine in (pesto chicken fettuccine), did not include the side salad that is usually included when you dine in. I called the store and, before i placed my oder, talked to the manager and she said she would include the salad and notify the staff about the mistake... after i made the order and received the food i saw that they didn't include the salad... pretty pathetic considering i called in before placing my order and talked to a manager. They offered me 10$ off my next meal but i will not be back. Overall food was cold and not the same as any other Pickle Barrel"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this restaurant and location for many years.  The customer service have gone down hill tremendously. I originally thought it was a one off situation but it's now a continuous thing.   I can guarantee if I come to the pickle barrel I will receive the worst customer service of my life with the constant excuse of \" sorry we are understaffed\" I'm sorry hire more STAFF.   It's obvious to see no one cares about the customer when the \" manager stands around talking and chit chatting as well as staff when people are waiting to be seated.   Servers do not know what customer service is .... our server came up piped there head in and said I'll be with you in a minute \" not a hello how are you, my apologies you have been waiting for me to come by for 10 minutes. \"   I can't see this location being around much longer with their horrendous customer service, enough is enough. I will definitely think twice before stepping foot into this location."}
{"text":"Food was late and sub par. The Santa Fay quinoa  was good. The remake of my eggs bene was ok. Dont get the Greek salad."}
{"text":"Came here for \"date night\" this past Friday. It was quite busy, and there was a bit of confusion with the hostesses when we arrived. The two of them kept taking turns going to look for empty tables and telling us they would be right back. Eventually, one said the wait would be a few minutes for a table in the dining room or we could sit right away at a high top. We said a high top was fine. She told us to follow her, which we did to a dirty high top which she cleared, but no one wiped down. We sat and it remained dirty for our stay.   I ordered the Maple Manhattan which was fantastic. I think some people might be scared off by the maple, but it really isn't too sweet, it's just right. I would definitely recommend it.   The runners seemed a bit confused about where the food was to go. Each time they came out with orders in our area, they kind of weaved through the tables until someone flagged them down and told them it was theirs. Our food actually went past us and we had to flag him down so he could come back, that was a bit strange, but it could have been because we were technically in the bar. I ordered the Harvest Bowl with no tomatoes. It arrived with tomatoes so I just picked them out. The bowl didn't look like the picture at all, but I think that is quite common. It was still tasty and the server was very apologetic when he noticed that it was sent with tomatoes.  My husband very much enjoyed the club sandwich.   Overall, you know what you are getting when you go for dinner at a Pickle Barrel. It was neither surprising nor disappointing, and our server was great."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for a while now. The food is very inconsistent. Sometimes it will taste 5/5 and sometimes it will be a 2/5. Right now they have a great promotion for $10 you get a soup/salad plus a main course between the hours of 3-6. The service is very very slow. Last time I went I had to wait 25 minutes to get my soup and 25 more minutes after that for my main and it wasn't even busy. Love the new prices however with service like that it makes me question if I should come back."}
{"text":"Worst place ever in the world. No server at all. nobody care the customer. won't go anymore."}
{"text":"This location is just bad, the food is terrible and service is average at best. Was promptly seated at a table and it all went downhill afterwards. Order the burger and fries, hard to screw that up right? Fries was stale and the burger was oily as hell."}
{"text":"I ordered the red Thai curry and it was good nothing too special but kinda pricy for $18. My friends got the triple decker grilled cheese sandwich with bacon and they really liked it so all in all it was a good experience and the food was really filling."}
{"text":"Meal was good. However, I was here with a big group. My order was messed up. I ordered the Santa Fe with dressing on the side. Dressing was already smothered. My wife ordered the mushroom burger with no cheese. Her order comes with cheese :S  She asked them to fix it, which they seemed happy to do. When the manager comes he asks \"who ordered the mushroom burger?\"  My wife responds \"I did\" and he places it on the table. When she opens it up it didn't have mushrooms or onions like it was supposed to have, yet the manager referred to it as a mushroom burger?!  My Santa Fe was delicious btw. My wife enjoyed her burger but far too many mistakes for one evening.   On a positive note, our server was fantastic. The errors weren't her fault.   I don't think I'll be back to this location."}
{"text":"I went here with my kids on a Saturday night for dinner.  The restaurant wasn't very busy.  We were quickly seated, but it took forever for the waitress to take our order and even longer to actually get the food!  I had the fish tacos.  They were amazing!  My kids had the burgers and thoroughly enjoyed them as well.  Our waitress was super nice, but she was very slow and made a few errors on my bill.  Overall, the food was GREAT, but the service was painfully SLOW."}
{"text":"Nice decent pickle barrel location. Cozy and quiet away from all the hustle and bustle from the mall. We also have a little one yr old and needed high chair for her so we decided give this place a try. Definitely beats mall food court food.. not bad food and really good service."}
{"text":"Their food is mediocre at best, although, they do have a newly constructed patio that I actually enjoy going to when it's hot outside.  However, I've never been to a place with SUCH SLOW service. Oh my gosh, I can't even wrap my head around how slow these people are. I know it's not the kitchen's fault, because every time my food gets brought to me, it's already semi-cold. The food takes forever to arrive and it seems like it's always one old Asian man serving the entire restaurant. Every time, they tend to forget something...e.g., sauce, straw, napkins, etc. by the time you get the sauce (if you are lucky), your food is literally borderline frozen. Paying the bill is such a hassle too, I wait forever for the one waiter to finally show face, and waiting him to bring back a credit card machine is another story.   They really need to step it up in the food department, but most importantly, they need to consider hiring new, vibrant, efficient staff. Whenever I eat here, I feel like I'm in a retirement home, everything's in slow-motion."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Waited for so long for the server to come to our table to introduce herself and offer drinks/appetizer. Then took another 15-20mins to send us our drinks. Then another 30mins to order and got our meals. My husband's meal was cold so he requested for his meal to be reheated, took so long to come back to him only to find out that our server forgot about it. The manager came to our table and asked my husband if he still \"wants his meal?\" Or does he want to order another meal? Any good manager will just give the client a meal right away without even asking as a courtesy. My husband was so upset and left the restaurant with no meal because he has lost his appetite. Our server ended up packing his meal to go as a complimentary meal.  This whole situation I found is very unacceptable. Never will come back here."}
{"text":"I came here with a girl friend to order some food and drinks on a weekday, expecting typical Pickle Barrel standards.. but this particular one in Markville Mall was just terrible! Both food-wise and service-wise.   First, the place was hardly busy at all but it took awhile for us to get noticed, seated, and then for our food to arrive.   My friend ordered the plain waffle with frozen yogurt, and she said it tasted okay, a little bit too eggy though.   My meal was absolutely disgusting. I ordered the Triple Decker grilled cheese, upgrading it to sweet potato fries for an extra $1.99. When the sandwich came though, it was cold. Clearly, it had been made using the plainest Wonderbread with Kraft fake cheese slices.   Let's just say I was horrified. At least throw in one slice of real cheddar? At least let it have been warm and melty? But no, it was cold, cheese was hardly melted, and the fries were just ok.   Not coming back to this one again."}
{"text":"For ordering expensive steak dinners.  The steaks tasted like card board. They were tough as nails. Knives couldn't even cut through them. Onion rings were soggy. And, to top it off, when we told the server and manager, they offered one slice of cake to compensate? Ah, yes, thanks but no thanks. Never ever go back there to eat again!!"}
{"text":"This place has the worse service ever!  The wait staff have apparently worked there for 30 years, and do not have a personality.  Your food is served to you like you are at an army canteen, and the food itself is overcooked and is cold when you get it.  They even get your order wrong!  The greet staff look like high school drop outs that couldn't care less about you, and the bus boys act like they would rather be doing something else.  The best part about the place is that you can laugh at the ridiculousness of how this place is run and the people they have hired."}
{"text":"$24 i'll never get back! I had fetta cheese and pesto sirloin steak, which came with soup, beverage and dessert for only $17.99. Soup was ok but the story here is the steak. It was the worst steak I'd ever had in my life. It was so tough knife couldnt cut through it. And it taste of nothing! It was like eating cube of sand. I ordered medium rare but the meat came rare. I knew i was going to get bad food but even at $17.99 it was insulting.   Our server was busy pretending to be busy but he barely did his work. He would run past us just saying \"let me know if you need something\" but he didn't actually stop to check if we needed something. And he was never seen again after dropping off our dinners. We walked up to the counter to pay after waiting half an hour for him to show up and bring us our bill."}
{"text":"I came here in the afternoon for their afternoon special (weekdays between 3-6 pm). We were seated quite promptly but it took our waitress a while to attend to our table.  I looked through the menus and couldn't find the afternoon special menu, so I asked waitress for this. We were told that we can only order it before 6pm (it was around 5:40pm at the time), and that she'd give us the menus later. We waited around 15 mins before given the menu so we were forced to order quickly.  I ordered the steak and mashed potatoes with a Caesar salad. The Caesar salad was mediocre, but the steak was not bad. For $10.99, I thought the steak was decent value, but the service and salad were sub par. The steak is probably the only reason why I'm giving this a 2/5."}
{"text":"Absolute garbage experience tonight. Two of the entrees were overcooked, have you ever had Spanish piellea with absolutely no sauce and clumpy rice?  They gave out horrid tables and said all the booths were reserved. The whole time we were there from start to finish the booths were empty. The front staff seemed to want to drive business away since they all seem over worked. Surprising since the amount of work being done seems non existent. No one came by mid meal to check up on refills/drinks. When we complained about the way overly dry entrees the server asked the mgr to remove them from the bill. But there was no formal apology or remorse for the huge screw up. All night long we saw other tables sending stuff back. Seems like the line cooks were rebelling or too untrained to turn out a good meal."}
{"text":"This is not a go - to place for me at all, but once in a while when boyfriend and I feel for something easy well head to the mall.  It has been worse but it seems to be getting better.  I'm not even going to write about the horrible service I had on countless occasions, just overall.  We go now when it's not so busy - late lunch around 2 or 3 (even then they're still slow) or late in the evening around 9. It's harder for them to forget about us when there aren't as many mouths to feed.  Anyways, boyfriend usually gets the fish tacos and I'll get the shitake mushroom penne (usually without the chicken). The food is always just okay; sometimes a little worse than okay but never any better.  Try if you want..."}
{"text":"The 1 star is for the state of the restaurant and the food quality, NOT for the waitress, Gayethiry who was extremely friendly and really deserves 5 stars.  We should have turned around and walked out the moment we saw just how bad the carpet was, crumbs, chunks of food, pieces of paper napkins, just a FILTHY floor.  We went with the ribs and wings combo which was being advertised and looked good in the picture.  Unfortunately we were so disappointed - dry and HARD, like, hit someone over the head with them and knock them out HARD. Nowhere near fall off the bone.  Thanks to Gayethiry for brining us extra sauces which we used to try to moisten the ribs and wings but that didn't work either.  Markville has really become an upscale mall and this restaurant is only bringing it down."}
{"text":"Worst Pickle Barrel location ever. Service is extremely slow. We've been sitting here waiting for our server to come to us for 15mins but she's standing at the bar chatting with another server. Antonio the manager did absolutely nothing about this. They also ran out of food items too. Antonio, as a manager you should apologize for your staff not being prompt with service."}
{"text":"Came here to a friend's birthday recently.  I was not sure if it would be a good place for such thing, but the atmosphere was fine.  Probably on par with Kelsey's.    The food was surprisingly pretty good.  The only gripe, as with most chain restaurants, is they try to please everyone by covering every type and ethnic origin of food.  This makes it confusing, and quite frankly, you start wondering about how authentic their dishes are (they aren't, btw).  With a name like Pickle Barrel, you expect it to be a deli of some sort.. and their smoke meat combinations are actually pretty decent."}
{"text":"Dirty silverware Fruit flies buzzing  No music Dead!   Disappointing vs. The Yorkdale outlet."}
{"text":"Bad service. I Sat down with a table of 5 and no server came to see us until I specifically asked for drinks.  Once the drinks arrived, the server finally asked if we are ready to order. We ordered a salad (requested dressing on the side), kabob,  Spanish pella, and butter chicken.  When the food came,  the salad dressjng was on the salad, and the server asked if that was ok although it's a mistake. We were straving and took it anyway.. but there was no compensation given. The rice on the butter chicken was horrible! Packed and thick. The sausage on the pella was over fried, and the rice on the chicken kabob was rock hard. I addressed these issues to the store manager and she told me she will reflect them to the kitchen. She did not provide any follow up after that. The server came and told us there's a small discount given to us due to the quality of the food..  she gave us a whooping 5$ off from an 80$ bill. Not to mention that our drinks were not refilled and the bill took forever to come. I will not go back to this pickle barrel again. The food court has better butter chicken and Greek kabob than them."}
{"text":"Management needs to staff this place better!! The waiter was super nice and gave us great service until he was overwhelmed with tables.  We had finished our dinner and waited over 30 minutes until he came by asking if we wanted dessert  We just wanted to get out of there  The strangest thing ever then occurred - he gave one of us the credit card reader and entered her total and left it for her to finish off . She finished in about 20 seconds and then we waited for about 5 minutes. He came back and set up the next girls bill in about 10 seconds and then left. She made a mistake and had to wait 5 minutes for him to come back.  He redid it and left . She finished and we waited 5 minutes. (He was making and serving desserts)  Then he finally came back and gave me the machine and just left  So i finished it off , printed my copy and left  We should have been out of there within 2 minutes if he had of just waited the 20 seconds each time but instead it took over 20 minutes"}
{"text":"Food Quality & Price: A completely unexpected and pleasant experience for breakfast/brunch at the Pickle Barrel in Markville! My husband and I love breakfast foods and our go-to places are usually Wimpy's or Cora's, but after we found how well this location's PB does breakfast, it is now our new favourite.   Steak and eggs are always a hit with the man. For myself, the spinach and eggs flora is always cooked soft to perfection. Not too raw, and TONS of yolky middle. The earl grey is ORGANIC and the aroma is just incredible. They really don't go stingy on their teas.  Perfect, perfect English Muffin (unlike a Pickel Barrel we went to in Scaborough who gave me my eggs flora on some random piece of sliced bread...)  Facility: Immaculate, well-light, and modern. Washrooms are well-kept. Although there is not much of a patio (you get to see the parking lot basically), it's still a welcome option.  Service: Service is always with a smile. Wait staff check in often and are always there to accommodate your needs. If the kitchen messes anything up, they apologize profusely and quickly seek to get it fixed for you. They NEVER complain or give you attitude, no resistance (unlike other PH locations). The weekend morning staff really know what they're doing and deserve to be recognized for it.  Overall: We truly enjoy our Pickel Barrel experience on weekend mornings for breakfast and brunch. Our dinner experience so far has been satisfactory, but it's the breakfast service that makes PB Markville stand out."}
{"text":"What a horrendous experience. It took 35 minutes  our food to arrive on a not-busy Tuesday night. When I asked to speak to the manager it took 15 minutes for an unprofessional looking manager to show up and she couldn't explain why things took so long.   Not to me mention that they forgot to bring my cole slaw and pickle and my daughters guacamole,  my corned beef was cold, and our kids' fajitas was also cold.   Aside from that it was great."}
{"text":"Wow!,  dinner was pitifully lousy!!  Do not order the Cobb salad!  They do not know how to make it correctly!!  Missing bacon, missing hard boiled  egg, tasteless dressing, Swiss cheese Instead of blue cheese!!  HORRID!!  And it wasn't even busy!! Service was terribly slow!!   This place has gone progressively downhill!!  Avoid at all cost!!!!  Forced to give 1 star!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the French onion soup and fish and chips.  The soup was very salty and not well made. The fish batter was way too thick. Overall I would not order them again."}
{"text":"3* for average deli style food and negative 5* for the nasty service at the take out counter.  A simple question had to go around in circles of rapidly aggravating communication - my question - do you have a fucking side of coleslaw and if so, how fucking much is it?   Over that, I just about leaped across the counter and strangled the snotty little shit giving me attitude over a simple question that he seemed incapable of either understanding or answering. I don't need the aggravation over borderline mediocre food."}
{"text":"Vegi burger tasted very good but it was too oily that  oil had penetrated to the bottom bun and was sitting on the dish. They had to change the burger and it was a long wait to get my second burger.  The stead sandwich was the same tasty but oily. The manage took 50% off the burger but was such an inconvenience. My friend finished his food when I was still waiting for my burger. The waiter was very good though very polite and helpful"}
{"text":"I have been going to this original Pickle Barrel location since I was a kid (Decades) and it was located in the middle of the mall before moving to current location.  I went there for birthday meal, and was disappointed. Even thought it was renovated a few years ago, it has not been maintained since. Missing lamps, tears in seats, and panels peeling to name a few.  Waiter was nice and responsive,  but needed to be more attentive to what is order and what makes it too the plate. I ordered ENGLISH STYLE FISH & CHIPS and MIA was coleslaw and pickle slice, and in my view 1/2 the french fries, for $13 I expect a full plate. My daughter was missing her mashed potatoes, and Dad was missing same things I was.   Pickle Barrel need to concentrate on customer orders and getting it right, We go regularly and it is getting stupid how many time we need to call back waiter to get correct orders.  This may be the last time for awhile.   Don't ask me about the extra dollar added at the yonge dundas location years ago."}
{"text":"Ordered the deli sandwich with fries and coleslaw.  For $1.00 they add extra meat to your sandwich.  Well worth it! Great meal for great price.  My friend had ordered the chicken hoisin lettuce wraps and we were a little surprised to see a pile of mandarin orange slices on top of the lettuce.  Now how are you suppose to make wraps when the lettuce is covered with these silly slices, not to mention soggy???"}
{"text":"Worst service ever! We came for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. Had to wait 15 mins for a table even though the restaurant was half empty. When we finally got seated, waited another 15 mins for someone to approach our table. The guy told us that our actual server, Mike, was busy and he'd be helping out. Fine. We placed our orders and got our appetizer in a relatively decent amount of time. We waited another HALF AN HOUR for our entrees. When they finally arrived, I asked for the bill and a couple of take out boxes since we had had enough and just wanted to leave. I had to ask three times for a take out box after that because they kept forgetting or just not caring. When I was finally brought one, it was too small and I had to ask again. Overall, the impression was that the staff just didn't care that we weren't being served or getting our food. Manager on duty was ridiculous and kept giggling through her apology at the table next to us who had suffered like we had (\"I am never coming here again!\" Is what I heard from the women next to me).  Unbelievable, not sure what kind of gong show that place is running."}
{"text":"We had a great experience, the place was about half full so fairly busy. Service was fast, our server was excellent. We had 5 different items from the menu all were tasty and generous portions. I think as much as half the time on Yelp, people are so critical they will never be happy. Don't go to a pickle barrel and expect $80 main course food and service just rate the place fairly."}
{"text":"I love pickle barrel - but not this location. It's terrible. The place was virtually empty & we had to wait 10 mins for the host to find us a table - that was dirty.  Our waiter was not friendly and disinterested in us. He was ok getting us a before dinner drink but then deserted us. Finally we flagged him down to ordered & then waited & waited & waited for our meals to be delivered. My wife's meal was cold so we waited again for a replacement.  The manager who also did not introduce herself was unsympathetic   Does anyone in this restaurant understand the importance of a customer.  In short I highly recommend that you go to any restaurant but this one.  Pickle Barrel should be ashamed to have this location as part of their organization."}
{"text":"I come here with co-workers after work from time to time. While there is a large menu to choose from, I have yet to find anything I've ever actually enjoyed. Today I decided to try the 8oz pesto feta steak. I had ordered it medium-well, it arrived very well-done, completely dried out, and about half the size it should have been. Didn't bother sending it back because I really didn't want to wait another 15 minutes for a new one. At least I wasn't charged extra for substituting one of the sides for a salad. The staff was friendly, but the service is seriously lacking."}
{"text":"Slimy restaurant! This location does not deserve the Pickle Barrel name!!! Waiter was overly friendly until there was a problem- then totally could have cared less! Food was overcooked and dry! Waiter substituted an item - then when asked if it contained nuts - said no...turns out it had macadamia nuts in it - had someone allergic to nuts at table - no customer care at all!!!!"}
{"text":"I have never done a review on yelp yet, but I feel compelled for this place. I've been to this location three times.   The first time, my table and I walked out because we were sitting down for almost ten minutes and a server never came to our table. Nobody even asked us why we were leaving as well.  The second time, a friend had to send her disgusting, wilted salad back twice before getting one that was fresh and not pre-made sitting in the fridge for the whole day. My burger was as dry as cardboard, and the paella was a clumpy, gooey mess. The service was also insanely slow for the amount of staff and customers.  The third time, not much changed. Excruciatingly slow service. Pre-made wilted salads. Dry, overcooked and clumpy food.  I have to ask myself, \"Why do I continue to come here?\". Three strikes and you're out. Never coming back here ever again. Not even for a free meal. I've been to other locations, this one is the absolute worst of all of them."}
{"text":"We came here several times in the past year, mainly because of convenience and variety of entries on the menu.  However, the food is kind of bland in tastes.  And the portion is on the small side for the price.  Service is not great, as they seem to be under staffed."}
{"text":"I ordered the Berry salad which cost $12 and another $3 if I wanted to add chicken. This is the worst salad I've ever had. It barely had any berries, some goat cheese, and almonds that were missing in action. The dressing was gross...it just looked like plain baby spinach salad.  The service was really bad, I went in search for my own milk for my espresso. And prepare for a long wait before your server even takes your order. I would not recommend this restaurant and especially not their salads (or nachos, they are gross too)!  Saying all this, I did find the décor and atmosphere great!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday afternoon for the all day breakfast with my boyfriend. It wasn't busy relatively dead yet we were seated at a dirty table.   For drinks I ordered \"the green monster\" and my boyfriend has \"the classic\" (strawberry banana and orange). I've had the green monster at the Vaughan mills location and really enjoyed it! So I was looking forward to having it again. Unfortunately it was nothing like the one I had previously, wasn't terrible but disappointing to say the least.   We both had the steak and eggs. When ordering I asked if there was anyway the steak could be seasoned with garlic or anything else, she said she would ask. However the staff at Vaughan mills were very accommodating and automatically replied with a yes.   After ordering I realized that I was never asked what type of toast I would like so when I asked the server she responded \"oh yeah it does but if u don't specify what kind I just automatically give you multi\" okay..thanks didn't realized I had to know that it came with it.   When our food came I noticed I was given two different types of toast..whatever I just ate them and my eggs were barely scrambled. No effort put in this meal. Very mediocre. Lost my appetite just looking at the dirty table. Definitely won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant for dinner with friends. I had the chicken wings as an appetizer and the BBQ chicken as my main, which I both enjoyed very much, especially the main. But when I got home, I suddenly remembered that I was not served the soup that was supposed to come with my meal."}
{"text":"Food was O.K. But you'd think a place called The Pickle Barrel would have some pickles. There were no pickles on the menu except on the hamburgers! Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Saturday morning was my first time at the pickle barrel in years. I remember coming here and loving the atmosphere. I wish my experience was better.  The food was average. The service is what made the experience truly awful. The waitress Katherine gave attitude when my guest asked questions about the food. She took forever to take orders and rarely checked on us. The restaurant was empty and we should have been seen to or taken care of. We had to ask her for water refills. When we were presented the bill, we needed it split in half; even though we tried to get her attention, she walked by our table multiple times, not caring. Finally my friend went to her station to ask for separate cheques. She put her finger to my friend's face and said \"I'm busy hold on.\" She then made my friend wait 5 minutes before leaving her behind and heading straight to our table with separate bills.   In my opinion tips should be worked for, not expected. I refused to give her a tip. This waitress was the WORST waitress and completely ruined my experience. She needs to be retrained on BASIC customer service, or fired."}
{"text":"This review is personal, because DAMMIT I HATE RICH KIDS!  I attended the junior high just acrossed the street from the Pickel Barrel Plaza, and never did I have money to buy their poutine like the other cool kids during lunch.  So I always used to ask for a fry, and even ate what some of the other kids couldn't finish.  That box poutine was like six dollars man!   Everyday I looked at those smug kids chewing on their poutine arrogantly with spite...  Then you know, ten years later I forgotten about this place, until I needed to get lunch.  I was like, damn....I'm going to that pickle barrel and eatting the s%*t out of that place.   I ordered angel hair pasta with mussels, a whole bunch of other side dishes.  Basically the most expensive things I ordered them all.  I munched it down with pure hatred, and my friend looked at me not knowing what was going on, thinking I went completely bonkers.   This was without a doubt, the most passionate lunch of my life.  The place was always dimly lit, even in the window section facing North the Sun was mostly covered in foliage.  This has always been kind of a seniors' restaurant, with the exception of the lines ups which accumilated during lunch time on weekdays.  You can get pasta or other food items in containers to go here, which was a big money maker when I was like 14.    The waitress came to ask me whether everything was okay, and I said to her (with my mouth full of pasta): \"MORE SPRITE!\" This restaurant, or I guess most pickel barrels focus on sandwiches.  I don't think a restaurant which foces on sandwiches should invest so heavily on décor, but it seems to work out good for them. This whole place is just too much 'Sunday afternoon' for me.     I don't actually like the food here, but I've been emotionally scarred for life.  I may one day come back here just to get a box of poutine, but I am risking emotional melt-down over six dollars worth of fries."}
{"text":"Got together with old friends and one of them suggested here for breakfast.  What a big mistake! No one greeted us when waiting for table, I understand that if you're short staff, at least acknowledge the customer and say \"we'll be right with you\"  the person at the express counter saw us , but didn't say anything until I said \"is there someone coming?\" Then he said yes and a kitchen staff came to seat us.  There was only one wait staff and I believe to be a manager.  We had to ask again after 15 min, the express counter person that if anyone was coming?  He said yes and asked for our drink order.  Finally the manager came and took our order very friendly, then the waitress brought our teas, the pot of hot water was warm, so I had to steep my tea in warm water, since she was busy.  The place was rundown, my seat was oily and had food scraps on it, we had to switch chairs ourselves.  I saw the banquettes were dirty.  Now I remember why I never came here since the atrium on the Bay location.  The food is only decent, there are other restaurants.  I'm sorry, but not ever again."}
{"text":"Avoid! I sent my mojito back 3 times! Yes 3 times because there was bug in it. The last time I just left it on the side of my table without returning. Food was mediocre and service was just so slow. Never coming back to this place."}
{"text":"When I was a teenager this place was a favourite spot. Thirty plus years later not so much. Serious decline in quality in every area. Also, they just got fined with 12 violations from DineSafe this week.  So sad an old favourite has failed to keep to the standards they originally had. I doubt I will be visiting any time soon."}
{"text":"A Good Place To Eat  I come to this restaurant quite often.  Today I came in at lunchtime.  The service was slow and my waiter was rushed.  It was busy when I was there.  I had eggs Benedict.  It is not very filling.  Next time I come here I will order something else.  They have a big menu with lots of choice.  I didn't like the dish that the mini desert came in.  I prefer the old one."}
{"text":"This is my second time at this location. Pickle barrel food is decent, after all it's a chain restaurant. However this location is just horrible. Sitting here for the second time, not only am I experienced it, I saw other customers experiencing it as well. LOOOOOOONG WAIT for everything. From ordering food, or waiting to be serve takes over an hour. Getting bill is more ridiculous because your server is no where to be found for a century of time. First time I was here with my mother, we waited over 2 hrs for the early dine. Now I'm here for lunch, we waited over 75mins, our appetizer isn't even here yet. horrible horrible horrible. If you want to kill time, come here."}
{"text":"I haven't been to the Pickle Barrel in a long time. We came here for my cousin's birthday so we had a pretty big group.  They allowed reservations which was great.  I was quite impressed with their menu.  I honestly thought they only served soup and sandwiches at this restaurant.  I was completely wrong.  They had a very good assortment of apps, entrees and desserts...and yes they had their sandwiches!  I ordered the Free-Range Turkey Burger that came with brie, arugula, peppered cranberry aioli, avocado, and an artisan bun....it was amazing!  Now that I know it serves more than sandwiches, I'm definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Never comment usually but thought I share since this is a health concern...bought a slice of cheesecake to go tonight but as the server was packaging it I saw moldy strawberries in the same fridge! I asked for a refund immediately and at first he was hesitant but after I told him about the mold he was obliged to give me the refund. The manager came out to do the refund but did not ask the reason for it, I guess it's a known issue or the server had already told him?? Needless to say I will never buy desserts from here again!"}
{"text":"Too bad there is no option for zero star!  Dirty restaurant with fruit flies and flies around our table, dirty Windows, our chairs were dirty.  Came for dinner, lots of empty seats but service was still slow.  I haven't been here to this location in 20 years and now I remember why. Over priced food, dirty dirty dirty. Will not return."}
{"text":"Ordered  take out. All downhill  from here. Waited almost an hour  for 2 salads. Finally got a beverage at the bar while waiting for 25 minutes for the take out person to tell the bartender we would like a virgin ceasar while we wait. Got our drink when the salads  were ready. Sitting down to eat these yummy looking  salads at home when we come to realize the crunchy spinach salad had spoiled bacon on it and it was quite obvious by the foul smell. I lost my appetite  and returned both salads and requested a new  fresh crunchy spinach salad. I also asked the manager to look into  the spoiled food issue and he said ok. I got home again and realized that this salad was spoiled as well. I had to to go back and return it amd request that the manager  smell the salad. He agreed it was spoiled. Why would he guarantee me the second salad is fresh  when it wasn't? Overall the service is pretty lousy because the staff is too busy doing nothing and wasting customers  time. I did  receive a full refund and an apology,  however this should not have happened  a second time. They should  have a food safety inspection before somebody gets violently ill. I only gave this restaurant 1 star because it was mandatory to post this review."}
{"text":"Ouch... terrible.  From order to food on table was 1hr. When food arrived it was missing half the ingredients (no mushrooms/onions). When I asked about it they brought out the sides - we were almost done our meal!  Really nice environment... but never coming back again."}
{"text":"If I don't know what I feel like eating, pickle barrel is the place to go! Their  menu is quite extensive and everything tastes great! One of my favourites is the steak sandwich...usually cooked to perfection on a great tasting bun.  The service is usually spot on and their lounge has a good vibe with sports always playing.  Can't go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"Literally DISGUSTING! Do not eat from this place!! I rarely have pickell barrel tbh, and if I do I usually get their poutine to go which is super yummy and filling. However me and my best friend dined in once bc we were too lazy to take the bus and go somewhere decent when this place was down the street and more affordable. So we go and whatever, order our food. And it's TRASH. Like my burger had no flavour, my cup was dirty, and the ice cream was watered down. I wish I could rate this place negative stars."}
{"text":"New design Same old tasteless food Service is weak but it matches the quality of the food"}
{"text":"Came here on my 2 year anniversary with my boyfriend. Hoping it would be a special dinner, but as soon as we were seated, no servers came to us for about 15 mins and the restaurant wasn't even busy. I had to get up and get someones attention for them to finally come to our table and take our order. We ordered dinner and it came COLD. Was very disappointed considering it was supposed to be a special dinner and probably wont dine here again."}
{"text":"Came here today, around 4pm and there was a special going on for $10.00 that comes with a appetizer and entree.   Overall the food was ok.. the fish from the fish and chips i ordered had too much batter, the grilled bbq chicken tasted weird, (was not a fan) and the green beans felt like they were not even cooked at all.   But overall it tasted ok, and pretty worth the $22 . Not to mention the service was pretty efficient   Will be back one day~"}
{"text":"The Pickel Barrel has always been one of the lesser chains, but I give this location three stars for vastly improving. It`s a huge restaurant, so it`s good in that if you want a bite to eat after shopping you can probably get a seat (unlike at JOEY). We ate at the bar, and it`s huge and surprisingly comfortable. There are giant TVs with sports, so you almost feel like you`re in a modern sports bar. The patio apparently has TVs in the booths, which is pretty neat as well.  The food was actually pretty decent this time around. I had the Thai peanut chicken salad, and the portions were big and the sauce was great.  There were more beers on tap than you would expect at a place like this and the service was friendly."}
{"text":"Came for a quick weeknight dinner and was extremely disappointed at the food, service and overall vibe of Pickle Barrel. First off, we ordered the nachos because I've tried them before and I really liked them. This time, the nachos were terrible, the cheese wasn't even melted, it was completely bland and there were barely any toppings on it and the salsa had no salt in it!   The waitress forgot to bring our drinks until we reminded her at the end of the meal and then once they arrived, the margarita was extremely salty! More so that it should be, and it wasn't just because of the salty rim, it seemed like the entire margarita had a huge spoon of salt in it.   The mains were sub-par and not noteworthy/worth mentioning.  I won't be returning to this Pickle Barrel, perhaps none of them in the future :("}
{"text":"I've definitely had WORSE experiences at a PB. The food always sucks, the service is always mostly-if-not-totally abysmal. But it's even worse because now they added These buzzers to your table - press one for \"order\", press another button to get the bill. So now the servers don't even do quality checks or actually serve you, you just buzz them when you want something. Ugh. Wtf."}
{"text":"We walked in around 625 pm , looking for a quick burger and some friendly atmosphere  The place was pretty busy but still had some empty seats and it took 40 minutes for waitstaff to come and greet us , bring us a glass of water.  We knew what we wanted right away so we ordered to avoid more wait time but it also took another 45 minutes to cook two burgers. when our food arrived I inquired about the longer wait times , our waiter replied that they were shortstaffed in the back and they really couldn't handle the load of people  The food was good .. nothing out of this world  ..  because of the long long wait times and the Unattentiveness  of the waitstaff..  I don't think this restaurant merited more  than one star"}
{"text":"Pickle Barrel is always a great choice when you are at a mall, and not sure what to eat. This one seems to be about the same as it has been in a long while, but still pretty good overall.   Came by in the afternoon with some friends after work and it was quite quiet inside. We got seated pretty quickly and service came by pretty fast as well.   We ordered Mac and Cheese Poppers to share, and got pastas for ourselves. The Mac and Cheese Poppers were delicious, loved the flavour combination, especially with the Korean ketchup! I ordered the the Sausage Penne and my friend got the Spaghetti and Meatballs. Both were about average, good but nothing amazing.  Service was quite good. Our server didn't seem to happy to be there, but we still got good overall service.  A good, convenient choice when you are inside Markville, but we do have way more options now!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the worst Pickle Barrel I have ever been to. I give it 1 star for the so-so food. The service still diminishes it back to 1 star.  Food isn't the best, sometimes doesn't taste very fresh. When I came here the first few times with friends and family, I had thought that maybe we were just unlucky for bad service and food.  I was wrong, I have given this place multiple chances.   There was one time where we had terrible services, unattended. When we asked for help or to take an order, the waitress would ignore us and just say 'later'. We tried a few times and got the same response. So we just simply got fed up after a while of waiting and decided to get the bill.  When we got the bill, obviously we did not leave any generous tip, because of the poor service. She asked 'was the service not good', and we said yes the service was not good, they took forever to take our order, the food came cold, they don't come and check if everything is ok after they bring their food. Sometimes they forget to bring your food, if you have 5 people, most likely 4 people will get the food if they're lucky. The wait staff just simply disappears and you don't even see them walk by! What the heck!!  Another time after this was the same thing, poor service and one time this lady was just really straight out annoying. While she was serving us breakfast she kept cutting in our conversations and just had no mannerisms. We tried to wave her down a few times during our breakfast and we couldn't find her for about 10 minutes and when we finally got her attention we told her we've been looking for her, but her response is 'you should've tried harder to get my attention' That is just unprofessional practices.  Anyways, this is all I got to say, avoid this Pickle Barrel at all costs!"}
{"text":"I'm reluctant to give them a 3, I'm definitely not a fan of this place, except that this time we got a server that was decent. The only reason I come is that the food is \"reasonably\"-priced and they have some healthy options but the general quality of service and food is sub par. Usually come here for their all day breakfast thinking it's kind of hard to screw up breakfast you think? And you don't have to wait for a table (hmmm... I wonder why?) It's actually quite surprising to me that they still have such a big loyal fan base, since this location is notorious for bad service, perhaps it's due to tradition and habit and it's quite a family friendly restaurant. I often see children running around.   Today I ordered scrambled eggs with peameal bacon and multigrain toast and mixed berries. There were two slices of peameal bacon they were quite thin and oily. The scrambled eggs came cold and oily. The multigrain toast was also cold and the frozen butter that I got did not melt when I tried to spread it. The mixed berries consist of blueberries, raspberries, blackberries and strawberries were surprisingly fresh and refreshing. I feel like at a sit down restaurant where I ordered a 10 dollar breakfast the least I can get is something that comes hot and freshly made or even relatively warm and definitely not cold! Was quite disappointed with their food. I do believe the scrambled eggs I had at MacDonalds was noticeably better since they had improved their food.   The staff here seems overworked and underpaid. They are consistently running around and it's hard to get their attention. We tried to ask for peanut butter and ketchup. By the time we got their attention we didn't need ketchup anymore. They then brought he tray of jams and jellies and it had no peanut butter which we specifically ask for. Our waiter eventually brought it to us but it seemed like he was super busy so I don't really blame him. It also took us a really long time to get the bill. I think there could be better ways to streamline the duties and processes here to allow the servers to more efficiently serve the customers. There was some guy who looked like a manager walking around and chatting with people. I think he could have helped out with some of the duties when he saw the servers are overwhelmed. Also the glass that held my water came dirty, perhaps also an indication that the kitchen might be understaffed and lacked quality control. Hard to say if I will come back but I did notice a bit of improvement since the last time I was here."}
{"text":"This place has been at this location forever!  Or so it seems to me anyway.  People come to the Pickle Barrel because of the breadth of its offerings.  There is so much here to choose from.  The food here is decent, but really, not that memorable.  There's nothing that really stands out.  Great for large groups, especially with the wide open menu, there will be something that everyone will be willing to eat."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Inattentive waitstaff, slow kitchen. Prices are reasonable.  Food is edible."}
{"text":"I was out with a buddy looking for a relaxing & predictable meal, so we headed to the Pickle Barrel at Markville Mall.  I'll start by saying that unless if I just happened to pick a great dish, people need to generally get over themselves and appreciate a solidly good sports bar. This location had plenty of seating on a Friday night, with spaces available at the bar and regular seating as well. I did have a significant annoyance though with how ridiculously low some of the seating was compared to the table. I felt like a baby, and not in the having all my needs pampered way; just small.  On to the food! I grabbed myself a small salad appetizer to start, highlighted by pistachios, sweet cranberries, and a really nice, creamy dressing. Then came the fried chicken and waffles. When this fad first reared its head, I filed it under ridiculous-American-concoctions-to-further-obeisity, but I have to put my foot and this dish in my mouth, because it hits the spot with authority. They serve you three mini waffles, each topped with boneless fried chicken. The chicken on its own is A+. It's super juicy, seasoned with a spicy kick, not scared of a little salt, and crispy enough to still pair with the softer waffles. The waffles are a welcome surprise since instead of giving you the expected Eggo Waffle simply sweat flavour, these little gems are savoury, with bits of corn baked right in, and the right amount of butter to hug your taste buds. God damn, did I like this dish or what?!  Anyway, this is the first and only dish that I've had at the Pickle Barrel, but as of right now, they are doing me too right! The uninterested service, some poor seating, and not so amazing deli sandwich (that I got a bite of from my buddy) brought it down to a 4."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Monday night after doing some Christmas shopping. Restaurant was relatively empty when we got in around 8:15pm and we were led to a table immediately.  Our server came by almost right away to tell us about the drinks specials.  After we got our drinks, it took her a while to come back to take our food order.  I ordered the Manhattan for $23.99, which is their 10oz NY striploin with steamed veggies and mashed potato.  I added a side of sauteed mushrooms for $1.99.  The steak had good flavours but was overcooked..I asked for med rare and got med well.  The mashed potato was seasoned well, but was dry.  The side of mushrooms I ordered was tiny and definitely not worth $1.99.  If I had to reconstruct the sliced mushrooms back to whole mushrooms, I may have gotten 2 whole mushrooms..  They had their 16oz Stella Artois on special for $5.99 but they ran out and offered Bud Lite instead.  Not quite sure how they made their decision of replacing Stella with one of their cheapest beer on tap.  When I asked the server about this, I was told they were willing to sub any beer on tap for the special price.  To end, average food and average service."}
{"text":"I don't know why I keep wanting to come back to this place. The service is horrendous. The restaurant is empty every time I go and servers are just hanging around, yet I have to get up out of my seat every time to get a staff members attention.   Some of the servers never write down the orders. And this isn't a problem if they can actually remember it correctly. But everytime it happens at this location, food is mixed up or forgotten.   I tend to order the same thing here - a deli sandwich with french onion soup. I tend to be the least dissapointed with this combo.   My soup is served lukewarm 100% of the time. Asking the servers to reheat the soup doesn't fix it either.   The sad thing is, even though the service is terrible and the food is below average to average, I'm still going to want to come back in the future. I can't explain it."}
{"text":"I'm surprise at the low star ratings. I was there for lunch and thought the restaurant, service and food was very good. The staff treat me as a valued customer. The price of the meal was acceptable and overall experience was positive."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever !!!   All staff are unfriendly and not helping ..   And I ask for managers phone number , they tell me to go get it at front desk by myself ..  gosh !!! What kind of service is that !!!"}
{"text":"Our waiter had the worst greasy comb over ever! That, at least, was good for a chuckle. Nothing else was. The first mistake was the water that my wife specifically requested with no ice. Within two minutes there's a glass of ice with a little water in it. We ordered the calamari for an app. My wife wanted the meatloaf. I ordered the cheeseburger with applewood smoked bacon, with the couscous as the side, since I'm not a huge cole slaw fan. Before the calamari was anywhere near the table there's the cole slaw I didn't want. Our waiter is obviously a little scatterbrained. The calamari was quite good, perfectly cooked and a generous portion. The meatloaf and mash with gravy was decent. My burger was very nicely presented. It actually looked a lot like the picture in the menu. Except for the beef patty. Nowhere on the menu does it actually say what size the patty is, but it does show clearly as a single thick patty. What came was two patties that were thinner than those on a McDonalds cheapo burger, and nowhere near the circumference of the bun. One of them had a chunk out if it that looked like someone had taken a bite. (I know it wasn't a bite, it just happened to be shaped that way). If you put the two patties together they wouldn't have equalled half of that shown in the menu pic. The excuse was that the thicker patty took too long to cook. I'd rather wait an extra five minutes for a proper patty. If I wanted thin, small patties I'd go to McDonalds. They did ask if wanted something else, so I changed to a BBQ roast beef sandwich, which was alright, but by the time that came my wife had finished eating. Management, if you're going to change something as basic as the patty on your signature burger, put an insert in the menu! Tell the customer when they order! Something! Anything!  If I had bothered to check the reviews I wouldn't have give to this place, and I won't go back! By the way, the decor was very nice. This place has potential, but it's not going to get there under this management."}
{"text":"Came for dinner because Joey's was full and was excited by how appetizing the menu sounded. However the food was a disappointment. I ordered the avocado and chicken grilled cheese and was greeted by extremely hard oily bread and bland tasting chicken. There was barely any avocado and the cheese had almost hardened by the time the sandwich reached my table... Not impressed :("}
{"text":"I've only eaten in at Pickle Barrel twice, once for their early bird breakfast (9-10:30am special, $4.99 generous (at least I think so) continental breakfast with toast, eggs, breakfast meat & fruit) and recently for brunch. I got the smoked salmon egg Benedict & my friend got the regular. We both loved it! The place is clean & the service was efficient. The wait staff were all very friendly, willing to answer questions, and courteous. I've also had Pickle Barrel poutine in the past (takeout) and their portions are generous!"}
{"text":"We ordered two small plates and two mains on this relatively quiet Sunday evening during their dinner service.  I was quite surprised at how quiet and unbusy it was.  Maybe because it was a Sunday night?  The Thai Fried Cauliflower were lightly floured cauliflower seasoned and fried and-tossed in a sweet Thai chili sauce and sprinkled with mixed sesame seeds.  The small plates section of their menu were intended to be small plates for sharing and indeed the portion was small.  I guess for $5.99, it's okay?  The cauliflower was good -- it's hard to screw this up.  The Moroccan Cigars were seasoned Ontario beef hand-rolled in a mini spring roll wrapper and fried until crispy and served with hummus.  I liked these!  I especially liked the creamy hummus too.   I was in the mood for a grilled cheese sandwich so I ordered the Triple Decker Grilled Cheese thinking that it was going to be super cheesy.  It had premium aged cheddar and came with a choice of fries, Caesar salad, mixed greens salad, or daily soup.  I chose the Caesar salad.  (For $1.49, you could also add bacon to it too.)  Unfortunately, the \"triple decker\" part actually only referred to the bread (-_-) as in there were three slices of bread with just single premium aged cheddar between the three slices.  I was expecting more than that.  I guess I know now for the future.  Taste-wise, it was a really solid grilled cheese sandwich.  The cheddar was yummy.  The Harvest Bowl that K ordered had basmati brown rice, roasted zucchini, candied yams, shredded kale, crumbled herbed goats cheese, roasted chicken breast, toasted almonds, crisp apples, grape tomatoes, and a maple balsamic and fig dressing.  It was okay to me.  The rice was a bit dry and the rest of it looked a little dry too.   I'm a little disappointed in Pickle Barrel.  I guess it had always been a favourite restaurant to me in the past that now coming back, their food just isn't all that outstanding anymore.  I remember its food used to be more hearty and big in terms of portion.  They do have many more options on their menu now, but the food just seems so-so."}
{"text":"I went to Pickle Barrel at Markville Mall for a business lunch meeting this past week.  I was very impressed that they were able to offer us a table with an outlet -I'd required a plug for my laptop for the meeting, and how quickly they were able to seat us at lunch time -most places are packed because the whole world goes to lunch between 12PM -2PM. Before I'd stopped eating meat and milk-products, I had always enjoyed the variety at Pickle Barrel -their menu is huge and very diverse compared to other restaurants that serve the same food.  But now as a vegan, I was unimpressed that despite their large menu, most of their dishes are not vegan/ vegetarian friendly, nor are the dishes capable of converting into a vegan dish. For example, they could not remove the cheese in a vegetarian wrap for me because the filling for their \"Roasted Vegetable, Pesto & Smoked Gouda Wrap\" was pre-made with the cheese mixed in .  It took me a long time to decide on what to order, and I could tell that their waitress got annoyed at me because I kept sending her to the kitchen to ask the chef if particular food items contained milk or eggs. I'm sorry, but I'm a customer and I have needs, and if you can't deal with difficult customers, then you should not be in the service industry. Also, when serving customers, it should always be \"service with a smile.\"  I finally settled on their soup of the day: a split pea soup, which was thick, but mediocre. I also ordered a tower of onion rings and requested for non-dairy dips if it came with a dairy dip -at that point, I didn't bother to ask about the dip; I received BBQ sauce and a spicy red dip for the rings.  In conclusion, I don't think I'll be visiting a Pickle Barrel soon, unless it's for vegan-friendly alcoholic drinks, like wines and shooters, but I could probably get the same beverages from any establishment."}
{"text":"I normally don't give 1 star. But this place service is TERRIBLE. Sat down for 15 min before someone even acknowledge us. We actually had to flag them down for someone to give us water.   The food is meh. I would never come back here again. And I would not recommend anyone to come here. You don't get service and the food is really not that great. Save your money and go somewhere else.   We end up leaving because we never saw our server."}
{"text":"Bringing down the rating because they have some hygiene issues when business is better. There was still food on the chair when we were seated, the menus were sticky and there was paper towel all over the floor in the washroom."}
{"text":"I don't know why I bother to keep giving this location a chance?  I'm on maternity leave with a new baby which means TIME is valuable, from everywhere I go, everything I eat drink, every restaurant I go is now limited. We chose to come here because it's more baby friendly and quiet during the weekdays.   We were greeted and seated very promptly but everything went downhill after.  Our server took 10 minutes to just come to our table and take our orders.  It gets worse and worse: our food arrived surprisingly at a decent time opposed to other reviews I've read.  We ordered nachos and the chips were stale and chewy, my mom ordered the Spanish paella and the chicken was rubber and dry, sausage tasted rotten, I ordered the lobster grilled cheese sandwich where the portion of the lobster was mainly only on the center of the sandwich and worst was it tasted so fishy and unfresh. I ate half of it and didn't bother with the other half.   The absolute worst was when we asked for the bill we waited 15 minutes before we finally got it. I was so annoyed trying to look for my server after 5 minutes and she was nowhere to be found.  Finally she saw me after 15 minutes and I waved her down again and she just looked at me with no acknowledgement!!!!!!  I rarely get upset but come on if you hate your job then do something about your life don't put your frustration on paying customers.   I would never eat out at PB again because of this location."}
{"text":"Hair in the pasta made my son loose his appetite. Then we ordered tiramisu but there were no lady fingers included with the dessert. Why prepare something if you don't have the right ingredients?  Dinner was shared with 10 fruit flys buzzing around us. Yuck! No wonder the restaurant has a  rating of two stars.  We used to come here as kids, but now we regret bringing our kids here."}
{"text":"Both times we've been to this pickle barrel we have had to wait an extremely long time for our food and the staff did not regularly fill our drinks nor ask if everything was ok. The chefs and waiters were constantly chatting in the back. Our mains came before our appetizer which was 30 mins after we placed the order for everything."}
{"text":"Expected more from pickle barrel.    Cold fries and turkey club on stale bread.    The waiter did replace the fries with some new cold fries topped with some extra grease.   Wasn't the best experience here which usually is decent and reliable."}
{"text":"Disgusting customer service from both the manager at the restaurant, as well as from head office.    The restaurant manager sends a condescending insulting so called apology email, and head office sends a disgustingly insulting \"form letter\" not even addressing the original complaints over a month after the initial complaint was put in.  As a former customs of over 40 years, I would strongly consider choosing another restaurant who has more respect and appreciation for their long term client  Are you surprised that the flagship location only got 2/5 stars here.?! I'm not..!  I will never set foot back in that restaurant again!!"}
{"text":"We had a worst service and worst food, we order 2 fish and chips which there was no taste of fish and stake wasnt done how we asked. Our server was a old man and we had no idea what is he saying all the time so basically zero satisfaction from pickle barrel . Nice familly area but service below expectation, very poor.  Been contacted with the customer service lady but no respond from the manager so i guess they don't care about the reviews."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with this location. There was nobody standing at the front to greet us, so not only did it take long to get seated, but we were not even acknowledged. While, the restaurant was not busy at all (maybe only 3 other tables), I dont see an excuse for this. The people working at the bar had seen us but still did not acknowledge us or call anybody. The guy who eventually came to seat us seemed nice enough, so we did not want this first impression to determine our whole experience. The waitress was also friendly, as was the guy who brought our food. However, they had forgotten the side coleslaw which came with one of our meals and only brought it out when we asked if it was supposed to come with it. This was not a big deal at the time. But the next day, we realized they also didn't bring the salad that came with one of our pasta dishes. The food was satisfying but this restaurant seems really unorganized. I would have actually given this a 2.5. l'm more about customer service  and that determines the majority of my overall experience. The only reason I'd probably ever go here again is because it's the closest to where I live. Otherwise, I'll stick to the downtown locations whenever possible."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this is the first review I have ever posted and I'm not the type to rant about a bad experience but for the sake of saving people from going here I figured it was time to write one...  I'm not sure how this place is still in business. In my eyes it's a sad excuse for a restaurant. First of all we waited at the front to be greeted/seated for about 10 minutes. A line was forming behind my friend and I and we could see the waitresses talking in a group across the restaurant. This started things off on a bad note but they quickly turned worse. We each ordered drinks, a margarita and a Bellini, both were barely drinkable because of the amount of salt in them. Seriously disgusting. I ordered the lobster grilled cheese and for the price of it i was shocked how small the portion was when it came out. It was cold, the cheese wasn't melted and the bread was hard. I might add that we never saw a waitress throughout our whole meal... not only our waitress but there was literally no staff around...so we didn't even have a chance to send our food back. We found ourselves constantly entertained by the amount of frustrated or complaining customers we saw while we ate. The restaurant was not even busy so there is no excuse for this type of service. By the time our server actually came back we had been waiting a total of 30-40 minutes after we finished our meal, for the bill. It was a waste of time, money, and frankly a waste of restaurant space...This restaurant needs to be shut down."}
{"text":"I came here with my friend who lives in the neighbourhood and it was meh. I've definitely been to better Pickle Barrel franchise. The interior design, service, etc. is great but the food isn't that great after-all."}
{"text":"Don't think of ordering out or dining in here. You WILL be disappointed, not sure how they still manage to be in business. Without the elderly population who frequents this place occasionally because they live in the area, this place would have been closed years ago. Poor service, UNBELIEVABLY POOR FOOD (if you can even call it that). Save your money, time and mental wellbeing."}
{"text":"I've saved my review in hopes that things at this restaurant would get better with time and after giving them several chances over the course of about two years, nothing has changed. The most disappointing is the service. I give it to the staff for being super friendly but that's all they've got.   I often notice the host/hostess running into the restaurant and away from their podium for long periods of time leaving guests waiting at the front for at least ten minutes.   On this weekday night, our FIRST (of many) servers was quick to come with menus, and ask us for our drink orders while we browsed the menu. It wasn't for another 10-15 minutes that our four waters, one beer, and one cocktail came. By the time our drinks came, we were ready to order.   Two servers came out with our food about 30 minutes after ordering (YIKES!) but they had remembered to bring the extra sauces on the side that some of us had asked for. From then on, we noticed our original server had disappeared. We were joking amongst ourselves that he'd flown the coop. Little did we know, he had actually left for an emergency. Nobody told us anything. After our food arrived it was very hard to flag down ANY server for things we needed. I counted... throughout this most recent visit, we had 5 different servers help us. I give it to this young gentleman who took it upon himself to ask us if we needed anything as he was making his way to another table with their order.   I had ordered the 3 Alarm Buffalo Chicken burger from their \"The Notorious Six\" menu and paired it with a poutine for $2.99 extra. Nothing special about the burger; like any buffalo chicken burger you'd find anywhere else with the addition of a stack of crispy onion rings on top, and battered fried jalapenos that didn't have much presence. The poutine, at it's outrageous upgrade price, was one of the biggest food disappointments I ever did see. For $2.99 extra, I had received a small bowl of soft, soggy fries, topped with CRUMBS of what once was cheese curds, and then slathered with an almost tasteless gravy.   A friend sitting across from me had ordered the meatloaf. It looked dry and probably was dry; she had to ask for TWO extra sides of gravy even though it already came covered in gravy.  Another friend sitting beside me had ordered the spanish paella. She complained about the lack of seasoning and tastelessness of the dish. But then again, she says that about every food so let's just take this out of account. Haha! Although, other reviews on here say the same about the paella.  When it came time to leave, we waited and waited and waited for someone, ANYONE, to walk by so we can ask for the bill. Alas, 15-20 minutes of looking around later, nobody came. One of us stood up and walked in to pay the bill. Let's get OUT of here. Ugh...  Overall, I'd really only come back for it's convenient location in the mall. If I have extra time, no place to be, maybe a little bored and feel like eating, I'd come here. Otherwise... yeah. No, thanks. Maybe I'll try another location and hope for a better experience. Maybe..."}
{"text":"Pickle Barrel is one of the restaurants you don't really need to Yelp because it's one of the chain restaurants that is great for family dinners and one of the safer options to go with for an average priced American meal.  Located right inside Markville Mall right beside Winners and the Shoe Company, Pickle Barrel is great when you're going shopping at Markville Mall and you want to grab a quick bite. I like the design of Pickle Barrel, it gives you comfortable space if you want comfortable space, a patio if you want to eat outside during the summers and an open area if that's what you're looking for too! Coming into the store, there are hostesses and hosts in the front that serve you right away. Our server let us take our time to choose what we wanted - my friend an I went for the bowls.  Both my friend and I went for the Kung Pow Kung Pao - we got shrimp and beef individually.  The noodles were mediocre - it was spaghetti or fetticini pasta mixed with soya sauce - Asian style. I didn't think $14.99 was worth it for this dish probably because Chinese restaurants are much cheaper. The shrimp was really large and delicious - there were about 5-6 large shrimps in there - something you don't see in Chinese restaurants, but the noodles weren't that saucey. The beef option on the other hand was rather juicy and had more sauce.  I think I would go back for the waffles or pancakes next time."}
{"text":"If I could have given my visit today a zero rating I would.  We went here for lunch and it wasn't particularly busy and we had dined before so wasn't too worried.  Upon wishing to be seated it took a while and I should have sent that as a sign of things to come.    Our waitress took our drink orders and appetizer request.  About a half hour into waiting we asked if it would be out soon, she gave us a grunt like \"ya ya shut up it's coming\".  When we finally got our appetizer after 45 minutes my friend commented that it better be very good for how long it took.  No apologies were offered.  The nachos were thrown onto the plate with some cheese and shredded up lettuce what a disappointment that was.  I regret not having taken a picture of the sad sight.  We were approached and asked if everything tastes all right and we said other than the 45 minute wait for an appetizer it was fine.  The lady than went on to question us with an attitude of really did it take that long and we were like yes it did.  Again no apologies.  Seriously if you are going to ask be prepared to hear the truth and drop the attitude.  By that time our food had come out and they had gotten the requests down to the sides completely wrong.  The food was subpar and would have been better off eating at McDonald's it was that horrible to say the least.  We wanted to pay the bill and ask for a manager, but we noticed they had comped us the appetizer so we quickly paid and left.  Please save your money and go some where else definitely not worth the time or the money for the level and quality of food.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"This Pickle Barrel location used to be so much better.  It's pretty unfortunate actually because I used to love going here.  I've been going to this location for over 10 years now and while it started out excellent both the food and service have declined dramatically over the last few years.    A few examples of things that could be improved:  - The wait at the front door is usually quite long considering the number of open tables.   - They are often short-staffed resulting in longer waits once seated.  (Although I have to complement the people they have for doing their best to keep things running smoothly, our server this time was great) - The food portions are a smaller than they used to be, including for items like fries and coleslaw.   But enough with the negatives!  There's always good points about a restaurant and this is no exception.  Here's a few dishes that I've had and always enjoy:  1.  Deli sandwiches - You can choose from four or five types of meat.  I like the turkey myself but they have pastrami, roast beef, and others.  You also have the option to add more meat for $1.99. 2.  Omelettes - You can choose your own ingredients or choose one of the kinds on the menu.  3.  Eggs Benedict - A classic breakfast choice.  4.  Burgers - A few options available.  One that I've had a few times is the Greek Burger (Feta Cheese, mushrooms, & onions). 5.  Italian sausage penne - A great choice for dinner  They've done a great job with the restaurant itself too.  The furniture and decor feels quite new and is always clean, the washrooms are clean and high-tech (touch-less soap dispensers, paper towel dispensers, as well as the bathroom doors which you don't often see), and they added an outdoor patio fairly recently which is very nice in the summer.   So, to end on a hopeful note, while they have been a bit disappointing lately, I know I'll keep going because they have a great selection of food.  I'm also looking  forward to seeing this location back to its former self and adding a few more stars to this review."}
{"text":"I've been here for an hour and a half and the food has not arrived. Service sucks! The portions are on the small side and the food Is just ok. I will never come back here."}
{"text":"We brought the family here for a weeknight dinner. I think the whole idea of a place like Pickle Barrel is consistency, but unfortunately the service and the food didn't meet the standard this time. One of the pea shoots in my quinoa salad bowl still had the root attached (and dirt too). Yuck.  Service was slow and indifferent.   The place was recently renovated so the atmosphere is nice but I'd take good food over nice decor any day."}
{"text":"Came again, and had great service again. The table could have been wiped a tad cleaner, but I can deal.   Had: Crispy calamari ($10.99) - so if you sign up online (name, email address), they give you an online coupon for a free appetizer! Valid for two weeks. They send it as soon as you register. My dad registered...or well, I did it for him, so our calamari was free!  Also had their steak and eggs breakfast again - latkes weren't up to snuff today, but they were crispy. Steak was a tad salty, but still delicious. Substituted my eggs for salad. Grandpa substituted his potatoes for soup. At another PB location, my brother substituted his bread for soup. So theoretically speaking, I could sub my eggs for salad, my bread for soup, and I could have a full on steak dinner. Pretty much. Very cool.  Caesar salad - came with my brother's meal. Every time I see a caesar salad, I cringe because there's a part of me that's been conditioned to see caesar salads as a food that I no longer want to eat because I've had them too much. I tried this one nonetheless. It tastes like a caesar, but it also doesn't taste like a caesar. I'm not exactly sure what I mean by this, but the dressing wasn't as sharp, and it was creamier than I was used to. I very much enjoyed it.  Crunchy spinach salad ($6.99) - I'm hooked on this salad. Even before coming, I considered getting this salad. I thought about getting an entree size if no one wanted to share meals with me. There's something about the combination of sweet and creamy and crunchy and salty and fresh that really gets me.  Tirimisu mini - $2.49 if it comes at regular price. My brother ordered a set meal that came with daily soup or salad, drink (my grandfather's coffee), entree, and dessert. Lots of coffee flavor. Actually used ladyfinger biscuits. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing meal here.  I've had a much better experience at Yorkdale (but that was a few years ago).  Avoid this place if you can.  We went on a weekend dinner.  The mall was already closed so the restaurant wasn't busy.  Our table wasn't bad but some of their seats were damaged and ugly.   We had the nachos to start, I had the fish and chips, girlfriend had grilled beef. The nachos were a mess.  Unnecessarily huge portion and the plain, shredded lettuce on it was super bland and a waste.  The fish and chips were pretty damn disappointing too.  The fish was barely crispy and tasted just ok.  Her meal looked and tasted much better at least.  So in the end, food was mostly disappointing for me but at least the service was good.  This place just barely gets a 2/5 overall."}
{"text":"This rating is for the banquet service, which is probably the only reason why I'm at Pickle Barrel anyway.    Location Inside Markville Mall, above Walmart.  Parking space in the back, with direct access to the banquet area.  The hall was clean and modern, with small stage and dancing area.  We were there for our niece's first birthday -- I think there was about 80 people in our party, and it was quite ample for that size.    Service Friendly and attentive.  Serving staff at each station (bar, meat carving station, food station, dessert and drinks station).   Outside food not allowed, and they are strict about this (other than the birthday cake).  They do have services for projecting videos and playing music, and they also allow outside party vendors for activities like face painting.  Food I wasn't expecting much, but it was quite decent.  Salads, grilled chicken, fried chicken and a meat carving station (which they said was beef, but tasted more like ham).  Desserts were pretty, but a little rich and creamy, so I stuck with the fruit tray.  They also had an ice cream station, which were great for the kiddos.  Overall, it's a good option for hosting a hassle-free celebration."}
{"text":"A newly renovated venue with the most funky interior. It is impossible for the wait staff to see anybody, and the service has become lackluster.  We met some friends for dessert after having dined elsewhere. I order the gigantic ( as advertised) Skor Sundae,  It is not gigantic, and you can do a lot better at Dairy Queen.   Since this is a neighborhood restaurant, we have eaten there often, but the last 3 times the service was poor and the food so so."}
{"text":"Pleasant dining environment. Friendly service staff. Food was pretty dry, like it has been sitting for a while. Nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"Lately, it has always been a miss here. My friend and I have been here twice and we really tried to give it another chance but they just seem to repeatedly disappoint us. I definitely don't think we'll be coming back unless it was just for dessert. The Choc-o-holic sundae is delicious and quite large. Great for sharing between 2 people.  Their food has gone downhill from what I remember from ten years ago haha. With so many restaurants nearby in the Markham area, you'd think they'd up their game to keep with in the increasing competition, but not this location. Their customer service is quite lacking as well. While the hostesses were nice, none of the servers seem to know how to smile. However, the hostess did seat us at a table with a dirty napkin, even though the restaurant was 80% empty...  This time, we got nachos to share and I don't know how you can screw up nachos, but they did it. Some of the chips were burnt underneath, and I mean like quite charred. Most did not have any cheese or toppings on them, so it was a waste, because who wants to eat burnt plain tortilla chips? Not me. I also got the chicken grilled hummus wrap. It was kinda small and nothing special. Overall, I would not recommend coming here unless you had no other options and were stranded at the mall for some reason. Or just come here for dessert. But just dessert."}
{"text":"I've been here many times before because of the convenience of it being in the Markville Shopping Centre.  With the recent upgrade in terms of renovations, it looks better than ever.  I always receive good service from the wait staff and I always enjoy the food here.  A great comfortable place to dine in!"}
{"text":"This place is going downhill.  It took awhile to get seated. Another family actually went into the kitchen to speak to the manager so they could get seated.   They were out of kids menus and latkes.  Floors fairly dirty - not sure why staff kept trampling over spilled food rather than clean it up.   Food's usually decent though and same for the service. This and the broad menu keep us coming back."}
{"text":"Had the strip loin.   Not bad but looked terrible.   Steak and mash was extremely salty."}
{"text":"Always good food and service at pickle barrel Leslie. Tilapia /w lobster topping right on point."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for many years now and also one of the only Pickle Barrel I go to. The menu is extensive and service was always great which makes it one of my go-to places.   Unfortunately I feel like this place has been declining the last few times I came to visit. The food doesn't taste as great as it used to not to mention the price hike and the service is extremely slow even when the place is empty. I came once with coworkers and we were waiting passed our reservation time because they were \"setting up the table\" but the place was only 10% full on a Sunday. There was also a small crowd behind waiting to be seated. I remember this location being packed in the past but isn't the case anymore.   Another pet peeve I've had in the past few visits is their policy with SPC cards. Card holders are entitled 15% off food but because the card is so small, SPC doesn't list it on the back of the card but has a full list of participating stores on their app. Each time I tried using it, the waitress are never seem to know what it is and decline. I would show it to them in the app and they would ask their manager. The last visit was the worse. The waitress looked at me and said \"I don't know what it is...I don't think we take that...but let me double check for you\" ok fine. So then she came back and said \"it's not listed on the back of the card so we don't accept it\" ??? I was already so annoyed that night so I didn't even want to bother with showing them on the app but seriously they should ether not be one of the participating restaurants with SPC or acknowledge all their employees about it. It's just really frustrating and a waste of time when the customer, waitress and manager has to go back and forth to verify their discounts.   I'd prob only come back when they have their early dine in special Monday to Friday from 3pm-6pm. They did increase the price $11.99 for soup/salad and a main from a preselected menu. It's pretty worth though in my opinion. Side note: the steak frites were not good (very hard to chew) and they also have an hidden charge $0.99 for gravy. It was not mentioned on the menu nor did the waitress say anything about it."}
{"text":"I came to the pickle barrel for brunch. I had the build your own turkey sandwich on marble rye with a side of latkes. I was very upset when I found out they don't have applesauce to serve with the latkes which is a very traditional accompaniment. The service was fine. My dish came out with the wrong side then but they fixed it for me right away. The problem with that was the latkes clearly had been sitting there because they came out lukewarm to the table. Other than waiting a while for a refill, everything was good."}
{"text":"It's an ok joint for a quick bite. They have all day breakfast and quite a big selection of food choices. Today I ordered a Balsamic Beet Salad, wait staff was very nice to let me know that it is extremely small. But that was ok cuz I wasn't really hungry anyways. Taste wise it was ok, but definitely not worth $11.99. I took a few bites from my husband's meat platter, it was not bad either, meat was moist and tasty."}
{"text":"#thePickleBarrel | Markville  Service : 1 / 5 Environment : 1.5 / 5 Food & Drinks : 3 / 5 Price : 3 / 5  Overall : 8.5 / 20  Comments for a table of 11 ppl: - Horrible service :       -  took them 30 minutes after our reservation to get us seated at our table.  Took them another 15 minutes to bring half the group water (reason, because they ran out of cups).       - cutlery was sticky and dirty, ask for a new set and their responsible was their kitchen is backed up so they ended up giving us wet-naps to wipe and clean our own knives and forks.       - food was moderate at best, 50% of our order was either wrong or over-cooked."}
{"text":"They are constantly renovating the Pickle Barrel, especially this location!  I'm going to base this review on my last visit, and think positive, usually its a terrible time at this particular location because the waiters have not changed in 30 years and they have no personality plus they like to charge you for the bread! WTF!  With that being said...  We had a very friendly young waiter, who was very glad to serve us, he suggested the Kong Po stir-fry and it didn't disappoint. It was very tasty and was filled to the top of the bowl with with noodles and veggies, cant forget the chicken too! Usually places like to skimp on the meat but this stir-fry had a very generous amount of chicken!   The waiter was also on top of bringing us refills of pop, before we ran out there was a fresh glass waiting for us to drink!  From this experience I would come back sooner rather then later and hope to get the same service again!   However it all depends on who you waiter is it seems with this location...."}
{"text":"Every time I visit this Pickle Barrel, the food seems to be getting worse.  Our server was so sweet and likeable, but my Chicken Pesto Linguine looked like it had been sitting under a hot lamp  for 15 mins.  It was dry, crunchy and seemed to have hard, gritty little pieces of god  knows what in every few bites.  This place has all the makings of great restaurant, they just need to get their S##t together in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  Terrible food. Terrible manager.  Ordered 8oz steak.  Returned it as it was not m.r.   Next one came raw.  Mgr came out and actually argued with me. Thanks for reminding me why I don't come here anymore."}
{"text":"This is the place to go when you don't want your server to talk to you or go even near you. My breakfast had hamburger buns instead of actual toast. Then the server didn't come to check up on us until later where we needed the bill..."}
{"text":"One of my go to restaurants at Markville if I'm not feeling food court  Food price is fair and not overpriced. Food is decent, as well as a lot of vegetarian options :)"}
{"text":"Located at the upper level of Markville Mall by the Wal-Mart, Pickle Barrel knows how to satisfy when you're craving for a bite to eat!   Been here multiple times and have ordered different things from the menu. The French Onion soup and mussels are delicious if you're looking for appetizers. However, if you really want I'm sure you can finish a bowl of mussels on your own as a main if you're up for it.   The fried chicken and waffles were quite tasty! The skin of one of my chickens was just a little burnt but not burned enough for me to ask for another plate. The syrup the had for the waffles were delicious, and if you really want you could dip the fried chicken in the syrup as well.  The only downfall was the service. The last few times I went, I remembered the service would be speedy at times, however when it came to bringing the food and sometimes the bill, it took longer than necessary. Overall, not bad."}
{"text":"I don't understand the hate for this place. 2/5?? C'mon.   Perhaps one reason is that I've only ever been here for breakfast when the mall is quiet and the service is fast. Another reason could be the staff in the kitchen. Our server specifically referred to the chef on duty as particularly fast.   Ordered the 3 egg early bird special. Substituted the bacon for the latkes.   Eggs were cooked perfectly. Over medium. Not too runny but perfectly yolky. I ordered brown bread and was pleasantly surprised with their choice of artisan bread. The latkes are to die for. Baked first then deep friend for that crispy brown look!  A nice touch is that there are a couple of slices of fruit that accompany the breakfast. We all need to be healthy ;)  For $6.99 before 10:30am it's a steal. Crappy diners, serving previously sausages and tiny eggs cost more than this place.   Coffee is expensive at around $2.60 but it is bottomless for you coffee loves.   Great service, amazing food, quick delivery of food. 2/5? I think not. A solid 4 from me!"}
{"text":"Ordered the 3 egg breakfast special - eggs cooked over medium. It's served with Artisan toast, and I opted for tomatoes instead of the meat.   The food was ok but did take a while. Also took around 20 minutes to get the bill, which left a bad taste in my mouth. Mind you it did get a little bit busy but we should have received the bill when we asked for it.   The eggs were a little over done. Unlike their Markville Mall location, this location needs to up their game a little bit."}
{"text":"Service is friendly although it could be a little quicker.  I think the interior is decent and do like the renovations for the patio that was done recently.  I also like the automatic washroom doors so you won't have to touch it when you leave after washing you hands.  As for the food, decent but nothing spectacular.  I've had the Texas style Steak Sandwich and while it was good, it was really greasy that the bread felt wet."}
{"text":"We used to dine at this location on a regular basis; we even knew all the wait staff's names.  Food was good, portions were huge, prices were reasonable. That was before.  Now, the food has gone down hill drastically, prices are considerably higher for much lower quality food.  A real shame :("}
{"text":"I stopped in to satisfy a craving for Montreal Smoked meat and was very satisfied with a very meaty sandwich with fries, coleslaw, and pickle. The meat was tender and moist, the rye bread was fresh, the fries were crispy, and the coleslaw and pickle were just right. The service was pleasant, although it did take a few minutes to be seated (with very few diners).  I haven't been to this location in many years. It's nice to see that they're still around and have updated the place. I'm looking forward to enjoying their patio with outdoor TVs and heating when the weather warms up a bit."}
{"text":"I like this family restaurant.  The price is reasonable and the food is in big portion.  I recently came here for breakfast,ordered an eggs benedict and multigrain French toast.  The portion is good enough to share among three. The smoothies and shakes are good as well.  It is a nice place to have a drink in between shopping."}
{"text":"If you come here on a weekday morning to noon time, expect a longer wait than usual for your food. They only have one host and one server during this time. Very slow service. I made the mistake of coming here with a 6 month old baby, both of us lost our patience waiting for the food. The food itself is mediocre tasting and overpriced in my opinion. I suggest going for the mall foodcourt or Joey's at the same mall instead of coming here."}
{"text":"Pickle Barrel is another chain store that I enjoy going.  I like the large menu, options that range from all American burger and deli to Thai spring rolls, the all day breakfast, the cocktails, the dessert and so on.  I love it when everyone in our office department can find something they can eat.  The interior decor of this location has been updated to contemporary.  The services somehow still remind me of its family restaurant root.  The pricing is okay.  The takeout counter at the storefront has fabulous meals.  The food tasted quite good the few times we had visited for Friday lunch.  However, I came a few times on Sunday evening and the salad was stale and soggy.  I have learned not to order salad from this location on weekends."}
{"text":"Working in the mall where this Pickle Barrel is located, this was often my go-to lunch destination. Not just for myself, but most of my coworkers as well.   That has now changed for good! 3 of my Co workers went there to grab brunch a couple weeks back and brought it back to our store to eat. They ordered the waffles and fruit. When they opened the container they noticed little baby MAGGOTS crawling out of the fruit on top of their waffles!! We have never been so disgusted.  I'm no expert, but maggots usually means rotting food. I don't know how often they clean their fridges, but after that experience, I'm guessing it's not often enough. Please, for your own health and safety....do not eat at this location. I know I never will again."}
{"text":"The service there has gotten bad to worse. After 15 mins being seated, we had to get up to find the hoestsss to find our waiter.  It took another 15 to get drinks.. The overall service was poor and it has been consistently poor rhe last few times i have been there."}
{"text":"First time and the food was great  I ordered the chicken pesto pasta Wasn't a big fan of the Moscow mule.  Our waiter was great super nice and took the time to go over the day specials.  Glad I ate here.  Loved the entrance decor:)"}
{"text":"Finally! I got some good service and attentiveness from the bar area. While Xmas shopping, I was getting restless so I decided to drop in for a pint to chill and watch a l'il Raptors game.  Sat down at the bar and was served promptly by a very friendly bartender. They have a good variety of brew on tap (10 choices). Additionally, their menu now has tapas items which is ideal for a single person.  Ordered the wings and the tacos, both were good and freshly made.  Overall, a good place to relax when walking through Markville Mall."}
{"text":"Whenever my family wants to get together for food, I ask where they want to go and it is a collective yell of \"PICKLE BARREL!\". While I may not share the same firey passion for this establishment as they do, I definitely think that Pickle Barrel is one of the better chain restaurants out there.  The menu is gigantic (pages, and pages, and pages, and pages, and pages, and...), so there is definitely something for everyone. There is also all day breakfast, so you can nosh on some Eggs Benny or Pancakes 'til your heart's content anytime of the day or evening (during business hours, of course.)  While none of the entrees I've had at The Pickle Barrel have ever blown me away, they've all been A-Ok. I do, however, have quite a fondness for their apps. The Deep Fried Pickles are always crispy and delicious, the Coconut Shrimp is addictive and great to snack on, and the Lobster Artichoke dip is actually pretty awesome. Also, if you sign up for their mailing list you'll get a coupon for a free appetizer - yay!  They have mini dessert samplers, so you can try a bunch of the sweets - I am always a fan of this, but I find usually some hits and some misses scattered throughout the samplers.  The service at this location, while friendly, I find can be a bit slow - even if it's not too terribly busy.  There is a take-out counter near the entrance, where you can buy packaged pastas, party sandwiches, delicious pickles and mustards, etc. My family always leaves with at least one jar of pickles and the deli mustard (both which I can vouch for their deliciousness.)  This location also crafts up a mighty fine Caramel Macchiato (though skip the complimentary biscotti - it's always stale.)  Overall, a good family establishment."}
{"text":"There is so much here to choose from.  The food here is great.  Great for large groups, especially with the wide open menu, there will be something that everyone will be willing to eat. Clean bright place. Defiantly going back soon."}
{"text":"I'm going to preface my review with this: I would never come here by choice. Even my dad, who has pretty low standards for food, said that this place was horrible when I told him where we were going.  Every time I've come here I've disliked the experience. The same could be said for many of the chain restaurants that serve mediocre western and bastardized Asian food at varying price points - Milestones, Moxie's, Montana's, Kelsey's, Jack Astor's, Joey... it's all the same. You'll find some sort of spinach dip at any of them. Swiss Chalet is marginally better because they don't try to rip you off as much. Many of these are owned by the same parent companies... sometimes I swear they just take the same menu, add tiny adjustments, give the menu/restaurant a specified theme and there you have it. Some locations are better than others. This is not one of them.  This is the perfect place for business and work lunches and large groups precisely because the food is \"safe\" in that there's nothing very unique about anything on the menu and there's enough range (the menu is huge) that everyone will find something they're at least okay with.  A group of friends chose this place and because I'm there more for the people and not the food, I agreed (next time I'm vetoing this choice). Space is huge with nice decor - you might not have to make reservations and the place is pretty clean. It was quite empty when we were there in early January for lunch. We sat in booth seats that were oddly really tall and kind of uncomfortable... the table felt a bit too far away from the seats.  I ordered a triple-decker grilled cheese with a side Caesar salad. One of the cheapest things on the menu at $11.99. Somehow we waited 40 minutes for a burger, chicken and waffles, a soup/salad combo (really, how hard is it to ladle premade soup and toss a salad in Caesar dressing and throw in croutons... no bacon here), chicken parmesan (again... how long does it take to microwave a piece of chicken breast), and a grilled cheese?  My friend was facing the kitchen and could see some of our food sitting there for at least 20 minutes (quote: \"I can see my chicken and waffles getting cold\"). I don't blame our server. We commented that he was the only one that seemed to be doing any work. We noted that everyone else seemed to be milling around... I get that there are zones, but come on. Why is this one poor guy doing all the work? He looked flustered and was friendly - wish I got his name, all I know is that he's Asian.  I'm pretty sure I could have made two, more filling grilled cheeses in that time. The bread was really dry (I ripped off the crusts because they were so hard), not helped by the fact that it was sitting out there for so long. You can see from the photo that the cheese used to be stringy and is now sad and hard and chewy. Not soft and hot and cheesy. Also, this is a pathetic amount of cheese with what is between three small slices of bread that I could probably pick up from the Walmart downstairs. My friends told me to send it back but I was not prepared to wait another 40 minutes and I was already hangry.  The Caesar salad was drowned in dressing. I didn't finish it but it tasted okay. I had some of my friend's beef barley soup and it was actually okay. Next time I come here I'll probably just get a salad and soup.  Total damage with tax and tip: $15. My suggestion: just go somewhere else if you can. I don't know how this place has stayed in Markville so long (rent can't be cheap) when it has been this bad for years... evidence being the 2.5 star rating. How often can you \"retrain\" staff when they clearly do not care? And yet people will still come here exactly because it's a safe choice. Be brave, friends. There is more than this out there. Nancy (is your profile picture a stock photo?), I'm sure you're a great person so this is nothing personal, but please tell whoever owns this place that a canned response is not going to fix the disaster that is this restaurant."}
{"text":"I come here in the morning. The place is busy from Noon through 3PM. The it is quite busy from  5PM to closing. So, best bet is breakfast before 10:30 AM. Service is great in the morning. Staff get overloaded as the day goes on."}
{"text":"I have been there regretfully twice and everyone that lives in Markham knows this is the place you would stay away from if you want good food and good value. Food is bad. Mine friend's salmon turns out to be overcooked and the fish and chips she got tasted stale. The side salad that I got was very very wet turning it into a soggy mess...   Thankfully, we didn't spend too much money cause the food we got was on promotion but I really don't how the restaurant would charge so much on such bad food.   The servers and decoration was however really nice and the location is very convenient after a day of shopping but I prefer to go to the mall's food court then eating here again."}
{"text":"One of my least favourite restaurants. I'm not a fan of the typical American style food restaurants, however, I often find myself going for friend's birthday parties. What I've noticed is the food is always mediocre, small portions &a a crazy expensive price. Pickle Barrel is nothing less.   At the time I was a pescatarian & there really wasn't much on the menu to eat. I tried one of the Super Bowls, the only one that had a seafood alternative for protein, & it was pretty gross. Had a very earthy taste to the quinoa & the salmon tasted very fishy. This was about $15 & I had to force myself to eat every bite of it.   The appetizers, such as the Cheese sticks, are okay. Once again nothing special for the price they demand.   Other than the food being bad when you dine in, I believe the seating area is spacious and comfortable. Their prepackaged food, that's ready to go, is pretty good. I would recommend the pasta salad."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst service ever. If I could give this negative 5 stars I would. Some genius decides to put wet coleslaw with my wrap. Soggy and nasty. I don't understand how it takes 20 minutes to make a wrap and put some coleslaw in a container. Sucks."}
{"text":"Honestly, the food was just okay but the service was so bad that I can't give, what used to be a decent restaurant, anything more than one star."}
{"text":"I have NEVER had a good experience at ANY of the pickle barrel restaurants. People who are giving them anything above a 1 star ratings either don't get to eat out much or have no taste buds and no sense of smell. AFter a few consistently bad experiences , I have made an effort to actively avoid this establishment."}
{"text":"Super disappointing. I actually used to enjoy coming to this Pickle Barrel location however the food has gone from bad to terrible over my last few visits (I come back because I live nearby but this may be my last time)   Calamari 1.5/5 : Soggy and small portion. Wasn't crispy at all and was poorly plated.  PB Nachos 1/5 : Covered in raw lettuce which I found weird, cheese was uneven and the guacamole which we had to pay extra for was actually gross. I expected something freshly made to be honest.  Sweet potatoes fries 3/5 : Only thing I found acceptable   Service was acceptable but the crappy food means I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I have a hard time giving the Pickle Barrel 4 stars.  In my mind, it's a 2 or 3 star kind of place, but I tell you what - when I went there today, it was fantastic.  I rolled in, and found myself quickly greeted by our server: Batman.  I'm not saying that Batman wore a cape and a cowl, or anything like that (pretty sure that's against Pickle Barrel regulation - much like playing any music that wouldn't find itself at a modern day Bar Mitzvha).  How did I know our sever was Batman?  Did he strike a certain resemblance to one Millionaire Bruce Wayne?  No.  Did I possess detective skills greater than that of the worlds greatest detective?  Again... no.  (I mean, you don't even need great skills to learn the secret - just follow a tunnel in your house, or steal the wheels from a car, or - you know - have your parents murdered in a circus accident.)  But I did none of these thing.  I knew, for his name tag told me so.  Moving right along to the review: Batman took our orders quickly, chatted about where we were from, what we were up to, and how our day was.  All of this happened while orders were being readied, and water was being poured.  This did not take up time in the way annoying server banter often can.  This was a fully integrated experience (like the type you get when on a cruise ship.)  My water was never more than half empty (one of the most upsetting things is having an empty glass for half of a meal.  I had no worries here.)  Not only that - the food was good.  I broke free from my traditional order of Hot BBQ sandwich and tried the Ruben.  It was pretty good.  I had offers of fancy sauces to dig my fries in - ranging beyond the ketchup, mustard, hot mustard, mayo, options.  The deep fried pickles?  They weren't so great - truth be told.  Too hot, the batter flies off the pickles, and you one get five quarters for five bucks.  Not even the solitary onion ring that holds them together can make up for that.  So it's not a five star - but with service like this, I've rarely enjoyed a dining experience more in public.  You know - I would go so far as to write a letter to the company about how fantastic this young man was, but - alas - I know not his name.  Who was that unmasked man, I will forever wonder.  But truth be told, it matters not - for he has but one name is restaurant greatness: Batman.  And that's enough for me."}
{"text":"Do not go here.  I used to love going here but recently the service and food quality has gone down the drain.   The last time I came here with my girlfriend, she got a plate of soggy wet calamari. Absolutely awful and gross, it looked like it was left out overnight to dry and tasted morbid. After she told the waiter, he just shrugged his shoulders. He was also socially awkward af. (How did he even get the job as a waiter? Wtf?)   This time, the hostess looked like she hated her life. When she seated us, we asked if we could move to somewhere else and she grabbed the menus and moved us (she seemed to have a bad attitude). After we were seated, it took me more than 5 minutes to get someone to notice my hand was raised. I had to get their attention by saying 'excuse me' really loud. There was no apology for the wait, just 'what can i get you'.  This place does not even make you feel welcomed and the food quality is definitely not worth the price.  I even made an account just to post this. Thats how bad it is."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday with a friend and it wasn't busy at all. We even called ahead to see if there was a wait but the hosted told us there was none.   The menu options have changed a bit since my last time here a few years ago, especially with their drinks. I ordered the Spanish Paella and it was definitely below average. It lacked flavour overall and the rice used was simply plain rice tossed in a tomato sauce as opposed to the Spanish Rice they used to use. None of meat included was seasoned at all and every single piece of chicken I'm the dish had cartilage in it.   Pretty doubtful I will ever other this dish again, since this is the second time ordering it but from a different location. I can definitely tell they have changed the recipe on this dish.   The ambience was nice, but not enough to want to return.   Our server was friendly, but she didn't check on too often, so it was a little hard to get a hold of her at times.   Heads up, the entrance, is actually at the back of the mall, despite the signage at the front of the mall  insinuating otherwise."}
{"text":"Was at this location tonight for a friend's 30th birthday dinner.  We had about 30 people in the party so we expected that service might be a tad slow but understandable.  I was one of the first to get my order in and the very last to get served.  Ordered steak and eggs (one of the simplest things on the menu). They got it wrong... TWICE!!!  Wanted Steak done rare. Both times it came Medium-Well... Ordered Eggs over easy. The first time they got it right but the second time they came sunny-side up...  ARE THEY EVEN PAYING ATTENTION?!?  The server asked if I wanted a menu to get something else because he figured the 3rd attempt wouldn't be any better, but it had been over an hour since I asked for the steak and eggs and I was very hungry at this point.  I couldn't trust them to make anything else considering that couldn't even make a rare steak and eggs over easy.  Went to McD's instead where I could trust they would get my order correct and in a timely manner."}
{"text":"While waiting hours for Apple to fix my iPhone we decided to try Pickle Barrel Restaurant. Big mistake!  My husband got a burger and onion rings and the pickle was served on the side and was dried out. It was very small,cold and tasteless. I had a seafood bowl which of course was mostly rice.i only had water my husband an ice tea and it was over 44.00!  Should have went anywhere else."}
{"text":"The place looks great. The waiters hyper and twitchy. The food plenty and warm as it's always been. Probably why i rarely visit any more.  But when you find foreign objects in the bottom of your water glass, dirty cups and empty creamers along with that, the ratings just keep getting lower.  Even with an apology from the manager and a discount on the bill. Surprising how popular they still are. Gotta say it's probably the last time i step foot in that place."}
{"text":"Meh, some people in our group wanted \"American\" food and this is what someone suggested. To me this is more of a slightly fancier ruby tuesdays. They have several locations but this one is in the mall. We got sat right away but it took forever for someone to come greet us. Our server was nice but I noticed he had LARGE section plus he had tables at the bar. I counted he had about 7 tables. We ordered our food quickly and he brought our drinks quickly.   I ordered the nachos and paid extra to add beef. You can also pay extra for chicken but I was in a beef mood. But ugh, when I got my nachos, I noticed it was a hamburger cut up and not ground beef. The beef was chewy and it did NOT taste good with the nachos. Nachos were dry, hardly any toppings on it. I got a side of salsa and sour cream with it. Salsa was not salsa. It was COLD marinara sauce. Like, for real. I'm not joking. The best thing about my nachos was the sour cream.   My sister ordered the salmon caesar salad and my aunt just ordered a regular salad as her meal. Their food never came out and there wasn't anyone for us to tell them about it. Finally the server came and we told him we were missing two meals. He went to the kitchen and we waited several minutes for him to bring the salads. Everyone thought their food was \"ok\".   Would I come here again? NO!!"}
{"text":"Visited this place after a long time for lunch and have to say it wasn't the greatest. Considering this is a well known established restaurant in business for many years, you would think the food would be consistent, fresh and good. The customer service could have been better. Our waitress took forever to come and take our order.  We ordered the grilled chicken hummus wrap and the hand battered crispy fish sandwich. The chicken wrap was good and the side of fries were warm and fresh tasting. The fish sandwich however was horrible. The fish was bland and served with a bun that was so hard to eat! The roof of my mouth hurt after eating the sandwich. The sweet potato fries tasted like it was sitting out for several hours and then warmed in the microwave and served. Won't be coming back here again. Coming after so long to have not the greatest experience was disappointing."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for over a decade.  One of my favourite spots, and absolutely love the menu selection.   I have a vegan wife / baby, but not me.  Their menu has something for everyone.  And, we've always found the service to be great.  Not sure why such bad reviews for this location, but we certainly will be back."}
{"text":"My experiences here were always hit or miss. However, it is a convenient place to eat at Markville Mall.   Today, we came in for brunch. We ordered the Steak & Eggs which was good. It came with 3 eggs, toast, fruit, and potatoes.   We also ordered the Breakfast Frittata, which was VERY disappointing. I honestly felt like I was \"cat-fished\" with the image on the menu. It was so bland, there were maybe tiny bits of bacon and some sundried tomato's and no cheese?.... at the end of the meal it was just a slab of egg with way too much arugula. I'm not going to complain about the missing baguette because the garlic bread definitely made it for me.  Maybe I'll skip the brunch menu and head somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"I'm very surprised it got such a low rating. Maybe understaffed from time to time. BUT!  The food is always decent. There's always a beverage promotion. And it's actually a decent place to watch the any sporting events. Because of the large screen.    Not the greatest in anything. But definitely nit bad at anything."}
{"text":"Well we went for Sunday dinner at the Markville location at around 7pm. The front counter host area had a lot of garbage infront of it. We thought maybe they are just too busy. The host did come quickly to the front and sat us near the bar area. Comfy booths. It took over 10 minutes for anyone to come and take our drink and food order. One in the party ordered the banana milkshake. It's extremely huge and the burger. He said both were good but the milkshake was the best. I had the steak Sandwhich which was good with mushrooms. I ordered medium rare and it came more medium to well.  The sweet potato fries were very good.  Another ordered the club Sandwhich which was good and another the deli Sandwhich which was good but nothing compared to shopseys deli. We tried to order the banana split for dessert but after 5 minutes they came back and said sorry no more bananas but they have everything else. Lol no thanks. The dinner without Aps or desserts took almost 2 hours. Service was slow and it didn't seem very busy. I would have expected a lot more customer service when they realized they have no more bananas.  Overall average but we will be back."}
{"text":"This Pickle Barrel is the closest one from my home. I have been going to this one for years. I am far from being a regular, though. Typically, when I feel hungry and have spent several hours shopping, I will come here for a bite to eat.   My go-to dish is the spaghetti with giant meatballs. You get two meatballs. In the past, I used to order extra sauce. These days, they are more generous with it. You get your choice of soup or salad. I typically go with the latter, but I felt like soup when I was there. I love beef barley soup. This one was hearty and good.   Normally, you get parsley or something green that is edible on your spaghetti. I'm guessing that it was so  busy that everything was omitted. Still, the spaghetti tasted yummy.   For dessert, you have your choice of the smaller ones in shot glasses or the humongous ones that you can share with friends. There was a mini tiramisu one I glass. I took that and it hit the spot.   It's a decent place to eat. My server was friendly and service was prompt.  (191)"}
{"text":"I honestly have never suffered through worse service, at any place, in any country, ever. And it wasn't just one screw-up, it was many. They only brought us part of both my and my dad's meal. We waited over 20 minutes, frequently pushing that stupid \"service\" button on the table and hoping the server might show some interest in how we're doing. At that point, I went to the kitchen and asked for a manager. Apparently he was busy, but showed up at our table about 10 minutes later.  We asked for the rest of our meals, the condiments I wanted so I could finally START eating mine, and refills for our long-empty drinks. These arrived a few minutes later, so after staring at my dinner for over a 1/2 hour, I was finally able to eat it. All I really wanted to do was leave."}
{"text":"We've been going to this location for years. Always loved it. The staff are young and helpful, and the food is just as good as ever.  The all day breakfast is excellent, and the salads and take out still are good. Of course it's changed over the years, but so does everything. I don't think they have their sandwiches in the box like they used to at least not as big a box and not as low a price. They have a really nice patio that was added a few years ago, and the smallish bar area with the TV is always a good place to watch a game. I hope I don't sound like management, but I just love this place."}
{"text":"This place used to be great back in the day but the quality seems to have gone down hill. Menu has expanded but over all mediocre.  My beef dish was tough, served with old brown rice and wilting bok Choy. The dessert that came with the \"full dinner\" had old \"whipped cream\" which was probably cool whip. Not a good experience. Stick to the old favourites, Latkas and meatloaf."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch for my birthday in July. Had the waffles they were great and filling and my family had the egg items and were pleased with their dishes.   We all had different smoothies as well. Except it took a while to get coffee and they messed up the coffee order but it wasn't a big deal.  Would definitely go there again! Also love the patio it was very cool and breezy which was needed in the hot sticky summer months"}
{"text":"The service was okay. The fries were yikes. We had a un uniform waiter who tried to service us. The chicken was dry. Plus, we went in on a non busy day and service was still problematic. The water, they left out our lemon wedges. The lemonade juice was terrible, tasted like powder, too sugary."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and with each consecutive visit, my experience gets progressively worse.   I had the double Monty sandwich. Roast beef and turkey on a pretzel bun, sounds good to me. It took around 40 minutes for our food to arrive. I gotta say that on first impression, the sandwich looked a smaller than I expected, but it was packed with meat. The first bite was very surprising. The inside was soggy, and worst of all cold. The pretzel bun, which I expected to be crisp and warm was cold, mushy and nothing close to a pretzel. The fries were decent, but it's kind of hard to mess that up.   Aside from taking our order and bringing our food, our waitress was nowhere in sight. So I flagged down a different server and explained my disappointment. Our original server then came back and offered to bring me a new one with a toasted bun. My replacement sandwich came in about 5 minutes and was noticeably warmer. However, the sandwich was even smaller than the last one, dry with a lack of mustard, and the bun had almost no crisp to it. The couple dining beside us had also complained that they were given additional charges for things they didn't order.  Mediocre food, inconsistency, and poor customer service. Honestly, McDonald's is a better dining experience. This will be my last visit to the pickle barrel."}
{"text":"The price is not worth the quality and service. The calamari came out soggy and the plate was half full. The server, who probably was a busboy, came out with the plate and said \"yo did you order calamari? I'm just going to put it here cause you don't have room in the middle of the table\". The new menus looks great, but none of the food looks like the pictures on the menu. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Visited The Pickle Barrel for their catered buffet dinner for a school event. I believe there is a choice of foods to be served when ordering. We had Caesar salad, egg/tuna/salmon salad mini sandwiches, mashed potatoes, penne carbonera, penne alfredo, fried mozzarella sticks, fried spring rolls, and fried chicken. For drinks they had Shirley temple, coke, diet coke, ginger ale, and sprite. However, the food was from an outside catering company and not from the restaurant itself so I will rate it based on the decor and atmosphere.  The room is spacious and there is a small stage for speeches and slideshows. The serving area is at the back of the room with a bar beside the entrance. There were about 80 guests for the night and we had more than enough room there. The place is clean and fairly modern. The room was temperature-regulated, and there were no big drafts of air anytime the entrance doors opened, and I sat right by the entrance. No significant complaints, for the banquet hall at least."}
{"text":"I've been to Markville Mall many times and I've never really gotten a chance to go to this place until tonight, and I must say I'm really impressed. I've always thought that they only sold generic bar food, but their stuff is actually very delicious and high quality tasting. They have wide variety of items on their menu so there's something for everyone. The service was quick and the servers are very friendly and genuine. I love this place, definitely coming here again!"}
{"text":"We placed our order with Just-Eat at 5:40pm, knowing that delivery started at 6:00pm. We expected our food to arrive around 7:00pm.   The restaurant called us around 6:15 to confirm an item on our order, so we know that they at least had the order at that point.  We called the restaurant to check on the status of our order at 7:00pm, and they notified us that the driver had picked up the food and was on his way. We are located only a 17 minute drive from the restaurant.   We called again at 7:30pm to follow up on the status of the order, and they once again assured us that the food was on its way. At 7:55pm, we still had not received our food and called again. We were especially concerned that our food was prepared before 7:00pm and would be cold by the time it was delivered.   The delivery finally arrived at 8:00pm, and to no surprise, it was cold. We would not have ordered from Pickle Barrel if we had known it would take 2 and a half hours to get our food, or even if we had known that our food would sit in the delivery person's car for over an hour after it was cooked.   Our meals were well below our expectations, and we would most certainly never order from them again. My sandwich was actually missing ingredients, and the milkshake that had been sitting in the car for over an hour was warm and had to be thrown out. The steak was completely cold all the way through.  We paid $6 for the delivery fee and tipped the driver, neither of which are acceptable charges in this case. We're at the office working long hours and the last thing we needed was to be consumed by rage and hunger at the end of a 15 hour work day. I made sure to wait until the next afternoon to write this review, because had I written it last night, it would have just been a long and partially incoherent string of vulgarities."}
{"text":"Walking into the restaurant, they wanted to seat me and my girlfriend at the bar. We requested that we have a quieter booth where we can talk. But after following the waitress, she ended up sitting us right beside the bar where it was just as loud. What's worse, is that the dining room had lots of open spots, and they sat us in the very corner of the bar.   After ordering some drinks, the time it took from getting to talk to someone about ordering the food, napkins, cutlery (after dropping off the food), and getting the cheque was an ordeal just to get someone's attention. With the hockey game going on, it was hard to have a conversation with my girlfriend and I was a little disappointed that we didn't speak up and tell them to put us in the dining room with everyone else.   Overall, the food was ok. Exactly what I expected, however I asked for some additional flatbread for my dip. I didn't mind paying extra for it, I just wanted some. But it never came. I didn't bother reminding them for it, just as long as it wasn't on the bill. besides, that was probably one of the worst places to put a table. If they are willing to put a table there, for goodness sakes make sure you don't forget you put customers in there."}
{"text":"We were five people last night at the Leslie Pickle Barrel.Firstly we were seated at the outer section where it was a bit cold. Four of us,myself,husband & two adult sons ordered from the Passover menu. I thought the food would be plentiful & good.Was I wrong. The brisket was dry as a bone,no gravy even on the side. The cabbage borscht contained no potatoes or beets. My son just tasted the cabbage & tomato sauce. Three of us ordered bubies (grandmas) chicken soup. Firstly, bubie would never make a soup like this.There were no carrots,onions,or celery. And the bowl was so tiny. The piece de resistence was my matzo brie.It's supposed to be softened matzo mixed with eggs & onions to give it a taste.This dish was cold, tasteless & unappetizing. The total bill for this fiasco was $103 plus tip.  I don't mind paying for the family if the food is well portioned and  prepared. I am finding the Pickel Barrel to be very over priced now with the food going down in quality.I won't be eating at the Pickel Barrel anytime soon. Roberta Chaitov"}
{"text":"Good: 1. Food is ok, it's consistent but average. 2. Conveniently located inside Markville Mall and rarely a wait to grab a bite during shopping.  Bad: 1. Bad for people who have trouble deciding what to order as their menu is too large and not focused."}
{"text":"One of those Franchise restaurants inside Markville Mall.  Food is ok, portion is big.  Great selections of desserts: cakes are displayed in the glass case in the front.  There are take away if you want sandwiches, they are all pre made and on display in the case.  I usually order the pasta which come with a Ceasar salad..   The service are fast and friendly..  Good place to go after shopping at the Mall"}
{"text":"Bad service and food.  My friend was served and I sat there and was not served until past he was finished eating.  The excuse was a mix up with the computer.  After complaining the manager came over and offered a free dessert.  I asked the waitress what type of cheesecake they offer. She named a few including red velvet. When she brought it, it was red velvet cake not red velvet cheesecake. Maybe they should train their staff to know what is cheesecake.  It was also the worst red velvet cake I've ever had with the icing being a gel consistency rather than creamy and no flavour to the cake.  As well the fish I had ordered was completely bland.  Would not go back to this location."}
{"text":"Santa Fe was plain and the waiter suggested to be the best. Never came back to check upon us. We had to go to the counter to pay."}
{"text":"I went here with my wife and in-laws a few nights ago.  Living in a predominately asian area, we often come here for a change of pace from sushi, chinese, malaysian, and vietnamese places we frequent.  I would say the food is just ok, but above average for a chain.  I usually get the salmon 3 course dinner, and once it had great flavor, the second time it was a little dry.  Cesar salad was ordinary, and the smaller, sample size desserts that they bring out are good, I usually end up with the tiramisu.    I'll end up coming here again, since the choices around the area aren't the best for non asian food..."}
{"text":"Looking at the reviews, this place wasn't THAT bad.  My husband and I took my mother in law out for a belated Mother's Day dinner.   We were promptly seated and provided with everything we needed. The waiter was friendly and informative about what was on the menu such as which food items were spicy. The food came quickly and was fresh.  On to the food. I had the pesto chicken fettuccine which I really enjoyed. The sauce was tasty and I really liked the sun dried tomatoes. However, I thought the chicken was a little bland. I wish it had more of a grilled flavour. But nevertheless, the dish was good and I was full.   My little girl had the chicken strips and fries. She isn't talking as yet but she ate a lot and would therefore lead me to believe that she found the fries and chicken good.   My husband ordered the Steak frites which looked very appetizing. He said that the mushroom gravy was really good.  Overall, the Pickle Barrel experience was good. The menu had a lot of variety and it took a while for me to figure out what I wanted."}
{"text":"That whole place needs to get a new manager and all-new staff. Everyone from the hosts to the waitress seemed to be completely overwhelmed and unable to handle more than 1 thing at a time. Took forever to get seated, water took 10 minutes, my coffee took 15 minutes and was cold (and gross). My eggs were overcooked and my toast was cold. The whole thing was a disappointment."}
{"text":"It's an good place to hang out with friends when people can't decide what to eat as they have a vast menu with many selections for entrees. I agree with other yelpers that the service at this location is a bit lacking. We got our food promptly but got mostly neglected for the remainder of the time, drinks took a long time to arrive   They have the early bird dinner $9.99 from 3-6pm Mon to Fri for a two course meal (salad or soup with an entree). This is a steal IMO. Quality of food is okay; portions are large"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night around 8pm. We first asked how long the wait was and after we learned it was 20 minutes, we decided to wait for a table.   After getting a number, I went to use their washroom and while walking through the restaurant, I noticed numerous empty tables that still had dirty dishes on them. I didn't think much of it but when we ended up waiting half an hour for our table, It was quite unimpressive seeing as how they could have freed up those tables for other parties. We were the third party in line for a table so I don't see why it took as long as it did, but I gave them the benefit of a doubt.   Once seated, we sat down to wait for our server who didn't come around until 10 minutes later. We were ready to order by that time but she said she'd be back with our water before she takes our orders. She comes back 10 minutes later with one water pitcher and takes our order and leaves. It was then we noticed we didn't get any cups.   After tracking her down (which took another few minutes), she comes back with our cups and comes back with a starter salad that somebody had ordered. After leaving, we realized the table had no utensils. Once again, had to track her down and this time, it took another 10 minutes for the utensils to arrive. During the wait, we flagged down other servers AND we saw our own server taking orders from other tables and cashing people out. This was frustrating so we just took the opportunity to eat the croutons with our fingers haha.   After receiving our utensils, the food itself took 30 minutes (yes, I timed it) to get to us. I ordered a chicken pesto penne and I wish I took a picture of it but I was too hungry to care anymore. The pasta was greasy and oily and there was a little puddle of oil on the bottom of my plate. I didn't end up finishing it.   It was my first time at pickle barrel so I can't comment on their other dishes, but I wasn't impressed with the service or the dish I ordered. I understand that it was a Friday night and they may have been understaffed, but our server just didn't know how to multitask to be efficient.   I might give this place another try as a last resort one day and hopefully, I can have a better experience."}
{"text":"This Pickle Barrel isn't doing the franchise name any good.  Our last visit there in late November 2017 was their last chance after a two year hope for a complete reset.  Previous management, service and food quality was horrendous enough to put us off for those years.  Returned with new hope that all must have changed by now, but they've got a chronic problem, and if anything, have worsened.  Slow service, wasn't a good start, although friendly enough when she was with us, that's something you could work with, but the food, that's a staple requirement for dining out.  My child's chicken fingers and fries came with a hidden barbecue sauce smear underneath some fries, as if they were from someone else's returned plate!  When my deli sandwich arrived (about 10 minutes later than the other serving), there was a brown coleslaw, cold sandwich with a mustard stain, the hard edged stale cheese -brittle!, and large chunks of meat ends (see attached photo).  I left it as you see it there, and not just for it's composition.  The chef clearly doesn't care about what they're serving at all.  We hailed down a manager who discounted our bill incrementally, but never returned, avoiding us.  No more chances.  We look forward to seeing another restaurant go in here.  As a regular attendee of the Leslie Street Pickle Barrel Restaurant since the 80s, and a fan, the franchise owners have to stop this location from doing harm to your namesake."}
{"text":"Despite all the bad revjews, everyone was happy aith their meal. The teriyaki salmon was plain; it's only the sauce that makes it tastes good. They're bigger cuts of fish compared to Moxie's. Edamame Haddock was plain but not enough sauce. Fish dishes needed a slice of lemon is my only criticism. Big enough portions. I will never get blue cheese on a steak again; sinpky out of personal taste, it got too rich for me. Don't add on to the potatoes; flavour city but a bit much for my liking. Great seafood linguini and the chicken & waffles wasn't spicy or burnt like some other reviews here suggest. Only criticism was I asked for caesar salad with my sirloin but got beans instead."}
{"text":"I only visit this location for company functions.  Space is clean and the decor is nice.  Food is good.  Good selection of salads and pastas.  Desserts are great with very yummy cookies.  Drinks are not watered down.    Service is nice and consistent.  I would dine at this location even if I was not there for a company function."}
{"text":"Disappointing.  Been here several times and the service is seriously lacking. We were seated and given menus.  Then it seemed like we were forgotten for a good 20 minutes.  We proceeded to enter our orders in.  Once again forgotten. The food took forever to come. To give u an idea. The raptors game didn't start yet when we ordered. And when the food came out it was beginning of third quarter.    Chicken in the salad was dry.  Fries were cold and rather greasy since it's put in a steel cup with no holes.   By the way the prices have gone up rather steeply since I came here last. About 2-3 dollars for everything.  Which is fine. But I expected more with the increase.    The worse part was a sense of attitude from the waitress after we paid.    The waitress told my grandma to pass her plate over to her to take away.  She then proceeds to order us to pass her the plates.  That's unacceptable. My grandma can barely lift the plate.   If they can't grab everything they should wait till we leave or reach over. I have no problem if she asked nicely but she asked in such a nasty attitude as if we did not tip enough to her liking.    Oh yea. And also. Our drinks were never once filled.  The whole table had empty drinks and unable to flag her down as she went missing during the meal.  My mouth is dry as I type. \"Gasp\""}
{"text":"Use to come here all the time. My last visit will be just that.. My last visit.   This place has unfortunately gone down hill. By that I literally mean it's gone down hill, through a fence, into a cess pool of disgusting water and drowned.   It's really sad to see a place that use to be so great become what this place now is. I feel like the only way this place can be what it once was would be new management? Maybe change up kitchen staff? Who knows.   Sad sad sad. Won't be returning. Wouldn't suggest it to anyone."}
{"text":"Ribs were amazing but the latkas are not like original they are smaller and were burnt! Why change what your famous for! Knish also not on menu! Sorry to say a unclean smell from back wall maybe bathroom! Waitress did not provide wetnaps before or after! Kind of a disappointment since this once was my favourite family restaurant!"}
{"text":"Came here with my mom and sister for a birthday celebration lunch. Tried their chicken sandwich with avocado, roasted red peppers and cheese, with sweet potato fries on the side. Very generous portion, average price point but I thought it was a pretty big lunch and had to take some to go. Ordered an appetizer, the coconut shrimp which was nicely fried and crispy, but there were only 5 pieces and seemed quite small. Also, tried using some coupons and the waitress would only allow for one and not the other, while other restaurants are usually not as stingy. Overall a good experience though."}
