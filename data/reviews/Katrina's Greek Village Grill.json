{"text":"First time here.   Breakfast was great!  Never going back to Sunset Grill even though I live closer to it.  Bacon was nice and crispy.  Potatoes hash was seasoned and tasty.   Service was good.   Really like the atmosphere.  Very relaxing."}
{"text":"Yikes.....it's closed. Went over for bkft last weekend and while the sign is still up, there is a huge garbage bin in front. There is a sign up saying....\"Coming Soon\", a falafel place.
Hopefully they're not gone for good.....will keep you posted"}
{"text":"This is a different place than Opa, this is not a chain restaurant, but a nice family run spot. Katerina's is great!  Quick friendly service and wonderful fresh food. 

Unfortunately the previous reviewer has based their review on the previous chain restaurant that was in this location prior to this wonderful establishment. 

Highly recommended, even friends I have brought here thought highly of the food.  They make their tzatziki sauce in house and adds a subtle flavour to whatever your putting it on. In general we have been pleased with our over all experiences whenever we have either come in or ordered delivery or take out. Lately there have been times when we have been less then impressed. Hopefully this isn't a sign of things to come."}
{"text":"Originally this was called Opa's Mediterranean and we really enjoyed the food & the atmosphere.
The service wasn't great because it took quite some time to get our food.  Also, quite a long time to get our bill.  To add to this, the waiter decided to charge me 100X what my bill was.  I got it corrected but I was upset with their incompetence.
Lastly, the food wasn't great because it was very salty.  I wasn't pleased with my lunch at all.

Unless there's a change in management or service, I don't think I'll be going there anymore & I wouldn't recommend it to you to go there either."}
