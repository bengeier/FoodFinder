{"text":"Sister in town from Ontario Canada and wanted some traditional Mexican food.  Manny's came recommended and the food was great.  Especially liked the Chimi Enchilada Style with the white sauce.  99 cent Margaritas a definite plus."}
{"text":"Please do not come here the food is all frozen and it taste old the taco shells were so old it took me a long while to chew my jaw hurts. The chimichanga I asked for no onions when I got home they put onions when I called and asked about it she told me that the food is \"seasoned\" with onions when I order the same type of meat in my tacos and those did not have onions ? if that's the case she should of been smart enough to tell me that my son is deadly allergic to onions I am not happy I paid 40 dollars and it taste like Taco Bell I asked for two tacos on the side she gave me a meal and charged me as a meal! The beans are nasty I could go to Walmart and get the value beans in the can it would taste better. I always love to try new things and this was definitely new and I would NOT recommend anyone here NASTY!! This is my opinion I grew up eat authentic Mexican food when you claim to be a MEXICAN restaurant you should make everything from scratch I was trying to figure out why it would only take 15 minutes. When you have a restaurant you need to love food enough to make it not give people old frozen food and try to rip people off"}
{"text":"We have been going to Mannys on and off for several years.  It has been over a year since our last visit.  Ordered shrimp tacos today and was very disappointed.  Two small cold flour tortilla shells with nothing inside but eight mini shrimp.  Served with a side of thousand island dressing and shredded lettuce salsa.  I don't recommend you order this seafood item here.  If you can't say anything nice better not to say anything my mom always told me.  So I guess that is it folks we will not returning again until I can forget today's eating experience.  The Mexican beer was the best part of my meal and only $3.75 each."}
{"text":"Had a BOGO coupon for either lunch or dinner combo.  On our way back from PIR testing & was so glad we waited to eat!  Easy place to find & ample parking. We were seated and our drink order was taken right away. Our waitress helped us with our questions about the coupon and all three of us recieved our own salsa dish which was really good they must be getting it from a better place than other reviewers have had. We each ordered a lunch special $5.99  #7 Enchilada . My friend from San Diego said it reminded him of the Mexican places back there. Oh was it good!!! My only sticking point was it took a while to get a glass of water  after our chips & salsa was served before our drinks came. The margaritas are very good & after 3 they are 1/2 price! Will be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch there because I was told it was really good from coworkers! Nothing fresh at this place!! Fish tacos taste like old frozen boxed fish from the grocery store old guacamole couldn't eat sent it back, shrimp ceviche totally watered down that it made the tortilla shell soggy and no flavor !! Old rice and beans - it all made me sick, literally!! Never going back!! Yuck!! Talked to my coworkers when I got back and they admitted they haven't been there for a long time!! Obviously it's totally gone down hill !!"}
{"text":"Manny's Mexican food is some of the best food north of the border, ..    With the friendly service and attention to detail makes this a valley gem!  The decor and authentic music inside are vibrant and inviting.  Ample parking outside makes it easy to get in and out even when it's very busy.  The food is excellent! My favorite is the Carne Asada Burrito ... but today I'm having the Fajitas ... what a treat! ... but it seems that everything at Manny's is delicious and made with the care and love that Mom would put into her food! My wife had a Chimi and asked for some baha sauce . . which is a very non-standard request for a chimi . . .NO PROBLEM! it was there in seconds, drinks always full! . .  They even found that so hard to do secret of asking how is the meal, while no one had a mouthful of food! My son had the Baha Chicken Enchiladas . .  he just raived about how great it was . .  creamy sauce, moist savory chicken, . .  he can never get enough cheese . .  he remarked  \" Wow this is really cheesy . .  I love it!!\"   The waitresses remember what my favorites are, and suggest other specials that quickly become favorites!  In short Manny's is just great and I can't wait to come here again and again!"}
{"text":"Neto, a waiter at Manny's never smiles. He'll stand at your table with his pad, pen, and a smug look on his face without saying a word, to take your order. You might get a \"what do you want\" or \"what do you need\"! If you ask him for something, he'll grudgingly gets it for you. He's even flung napkins at us before. We are very patient people and have been there many times because we like the food, but every time he serves us, our family is overtaken by a negative change of mood. We would ask for another waiter but the restaurant is so slow, oftentimes Neto is the only waiter. We've been going to this restaurant for over 12 years, but Neto has only been there for only a few years. We've complained to Manny many times, but evidently Manny doesn't care about the impact this makes on customers who've been loyal for over a decade. Perhaps Manny is afraid of him. You would think Neto would be sat down by Manny and explained the importance of customer service by making customer service a priority and a huge part of Neto's continued employment. I don't want Neto to lose his job, but I also don't want to continue spending my hard earned money in an environment of tension. Our last visit was a lot of the same tension and I'm tired of it. I am an excellent tipper with 20% minimum, but often 30%, and sometimes 100%. Our last visit, I only tipped one dollar. I was so upset I called Manny at the other location but it seemed that he didn't care. It's sad to say but we will not be going back. It's crazy that one employee can destroy business right underneath the nose of ownership. What ever happen to customers first. I guess Manny doesn't realize that there are plenty of other options I.E.- Raul and Teresa's, Rio Mirage, etc."}
{"text":"Went to manny's for Cinco de Mayo. Big mistake! This is not authentic Mexican food! I ordered there version of albondigas soup. All grease. No vegies. Tiny meat balls. Who would serve this to anyone. There version of tamales are frozen heated  in the microwave. This is not fresh homemade food. Unfortunately for them not going here again. Should of went to Garcias."}
{"text":"AbSOlutely Disgusting Wow! 1st  of all it smells of dirty carpet,2nd the chips are super greasy leave a bad after taste,I orderd fish tacos it came out and i almost pee'd my pants! It was 2 fish sticks on a plain dry tortilla!!!! the secret sauce they give you looked to be chunky calmine lotion! I asked the waiter what was this as i hold up the fish stick,he said i dunno its fish! haha wow Never again manny,never again! And the waiter wasnt even thankful he got a 10.00 tip!!!"}
{"text":"I'm NOT saying don't eat here. I AM saying make sure to order the right food. Good chimichangas, great salsa and service!. Bad spinach enchiladas! Gross fish taco. Carne asada is ok."}
{"text":"I brought my girlfriend of 3 years here for dinner the other night .  She is not one for trying new things but I have to say by the end of the meal she was looking forward to our next dinner date there.  The waiter was so patient and tour guided her through the entire menu to ensure that she picked an item that she would love .  I know they were busy at the time but we felt like we were his only concern in the world .  I have and always will be a big fan of Manny's ."}
{"text":"Great customer service!! Our server was fast and checked on us many times to see how we were doing . We had the Mexican pizza for appetizer which was full of flavor. The chips and salsa were good and free. I enjoyed my food beside the burrito it had cubed beef not a big fan of that. Margaritas were tasty also. Good experience would return."}
{"text":"Wow my food was just awful !!' Steak was very thick & dry & just couldn't even chew it !!! Paid $16.00 and I would love to enjoy my food !!! Sorry won't be back !!! Oh yea had the fajitas ...."}
{"text":"Horrible. A couple years ago it was good; I have no idea what happened. I ordered the tamales and they looked like canned soup. I'm giving it 2 stars because the service was decent. I'll still be searching for a close by, non chain, Mexican food restaurant/cafe."}
{"text":"Finally stopped in after an afternoon at the driving range across the street. My margarita was strong, definitely got my monies worth! Service was fast, friendly and the food hot. My marinated steak taco was excellent, as was my wife's shredded beef taco. Will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Wife and I rode the Harley over for lunch. Great food... will return."}
{"text":"Some people gave this place bad reviews my experience here with the family was excellent their hospitality was super the food was awesome Elsa was a very good host to us."}
{"text":"Not bad, not good. The prices were fine, but the food left me feeling thoroughly unimpressed. In a mix of all the other Mexican restaurants in the area, this one unfortunately does not stand out."}
{"text":"WOW!  Very good, authentic mexican food!  Nice portions, good prices, \"around 10 bucks a plate\", and a very nice staff, I do wonder how attentive they would be when really busy, but for our first time, the service was excellent...  Place was clean, good music and the food was served on very hot plates.  Good chips and salsa while ya' wait for your order.  Nice outdoor seating with a fireplace and bar.  Can't really say anything bad about our experience.  Will have to go again if they have another Groupon coupon!"}
{"text":"The food has been really good every time we've been there, and we have been there a lot!   But...  The wait staff must be working a call center in the back because like another reviewer said, you will not see them for long periods of time.  You're lucky to get refills on drinks, and when you ask for water for the entire table, you're lucky if you get any.  I had to remind our waiter, and he only brought out water for half of our group.  We have been there when's it's dead, and when it's busy.  The service is consistent; very poor.  If you have time to kill, and you're not in a hurry, this is your place.  Be sure to buy a certificate from restaurant.com.  I picked up a bunch of $25 off of a $35 minimum purchase for under $2 each."}
{"text":"We experienced greasy tacos, stale chips, and the Chile relleno was more egg than chile. We arrived with a 2 for 1 coupon which they forgot to honor and had to be reminded at check out. Never found the service to be especially friendly. There are so many more choices in the West Valley for good Mexican food."}
{"text":"Service is horrible!! Two waitresses for entire restaurant. Stuff never arrived at table when ordered. Bad experience!! Hire more servers!!"}
{"text":"Like a cleaned up version of Raul and Theresas. Clean and colorful. Food is decent and reasonably priced. Our waiter was polite and efficient but not overly friendly. Try smiling. Also never came back to check on us after serving.  Ample parking. Cute outdoor bar with dance music.   We like Chevy's or Macayo's better."}
{"text":"Mannys alcohol beverage tasted like flu medicine. I would stick with regular domestic beer next time. Didn't like the crunchy Quesadilla, soft one might be better. Carne Asada dinner was really good. Lot of good meat. Service was good, but check up on you every minute literally.   I might come back if I'm in this area of town"}
{"text":"This was our first time at this establishment. The first impression was it looked dirty and upon looking at menu it had food stuck to it. Gross. The food came out just dried up and my nachos were burned black. The waiter had ZERO class and didn't observe even the most basic etiquette. We ordered dessert to use up Groupon funds and fried ice cream was literally raw batter with stale corn flaked poured over vanilla ice cream. There was nothing fried about it. Raw, inedible slop. The waiter brought the bill receipt and STOOD AND LOOKED OVER OUR SHOULDER WHEN WRITING DOWN TIP. He would not leave the table! He grabbed the receipt and looked at it all the way back to the kitchen. Really??? Horrible horrible horrible."}
{"text":"love the food and enjoy the service. we went across the street at the driving range so we decided to check them out. the shrimp tacos were delicious"}
{"text":"We just ate at Manny's  for the first time  and it was wonderful.  Had the Carna Asada Burro. It was delicious and a spinach enchiladas with Baja sauce and they were also very good. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is close to my house, so I go occasionally when I just need a Mexican food fix. However, I have not had a consistent experience. Sometimes the food and service are decent, sometimes just the food, sometimes just the service. Totally hit or miss. But I like the small town restaurant feel of this place and perhaps that's what keeps me coming back every few months or so. Definitely experienced better, but most definitely have experienced worse."}
{"text":"Wife was looking for a new place to celebrate our 32 anniversary.  Got on groupon and found a deal.  When we arrived, the place looked like a dive, but sometimes a book by the cover comes to mind.  Greeted quickly, sat down and ordered a margarita.  Yea, margaritas go with Mexican food like beer and wings.  Server stated they did not serve alcohol.  Odd since I saw a patio bar when we came in.  Any rate, we stated we were looking forward to a drink with our meal and stated we would not be staying.  He stated the other location served liquor.  As I was leaving, the server stated, senior, and rudely tapped his finger on a piece of paper near the entry that said they don't serve alcohol.  Now I admit, I don't read everything I ever see, especially when I am not looking in that direction.  No biggie.  Can't comment on the food, but if you want a drink, skip Manny's.  Makes me wonder why they lost their license in the first place?  Does not bid well as to the management..."}
{"text":"Terrible food. What ever you do don't order albondigas soup.  It was a bowl full of greasy unstrained beef with one measly piece of carrot and celery and three small meatballs of mystery meat. Corn tortillas were greasy. Won't be returning to this place.  Kudos to wait staff, they were attentive."}
{"text":"Food was average, great margaritas with option to buy a pitcher, atmosphere was ok... nothing spectacular, service was just ok. So, I guess my favorite things were the margaritas and chips and salsa."}
{"text":"If your not super hungry and not in a hurry this place is good but slow service wanted to get appetizer they forgot to put it in so when my food came out I said where is my appetizer they said forgot to put it in we scratched that I guess it wasn't meant to be ..."}
{"text":"my dads bowl of red chili was like a cup not a bowl.  Waiter was not personable..   seen waiter only like three times... one good thing that we got was the churro sundae"}
{"text":"Terrible food and what's worse is the service. Horrible service. Don't waste your time or money on this place!"}
{"text":"My wife and I bought a $30 Groupon for Manny's.The tacos and enchiladas were decent enough.I liked the free chips and salsa.But the service was lackadaisical at best,and negligent at worst,and it was a very slow time of day.                  We got our bill,and the total was about $21.We were then told we had to use the whole 30.I said it was ok,we can forfeit the rest.We were then informed that the bill had to be 30,so they could add the 18% gratuity in the fine print on the Groupon.Thats fine,go ahead.We get the revised bill,and they added the extra sales tax of bumping it to 30,along with the gratuity.To review,a $21 bill became a $39 bill.It was only nine dollars out of my pocket,no biggie.But what a rinky dink way of doing business.            I live only a few miles from here.If the service and attitude had better,or even made sense,they would have had a steady customer.As it is,Groupon would have to pay ME to go back."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for a good close by Mexican food restaurant but this one failed. The chips and salsa were great but when it took forever for our food to arrive, our server said some of our food went to the table next to us because that server was faster! The food wasn't that great even after the wait and there was no offer to make our experience better either. Never again!"}
{"text":"I can't help only giving it 2 stars. The food was no bueno at all.  Everything tasted like it came from a can.  Thank goodness i had a Groupon.     Chips & salsa - salsa was from a jar with fresh cilantro  added to it.   Maryloue folder quesadilla w/ ground beef- tasted like the beef was dog food.   Tres Mariachi Enchiladas- green sauce was der from a can. Baja sauce wasnt bad. Red sauce tasted like it was made with cheap tomatoes sauce.    I got 2 fried ice cream to go because i didn't have cash to leave a tip.   Even though the service was less to be desired, i still wanted to leave something.   Sadly, We won't be back."}
{"text":"This is the worst Mexican food I've ever had. The steak is not even real steak and really had to chew. The regular margaritas are crap. I would not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"Pretty good food with an ice cold Pacifica. Sat on the patio. Driving range across the street."}
{"text":"Truly authentic and delicious!  Nice bar and sitting area.  The owner was on-site which was nice.  An awesome find!  Loved it."}
{"text":"Flavorless food, and sad service. Everything was bland, no spices, no flavor. The \"salsa\" was watery tomato sauce with CHUNKS of onion. The ONLY good thing was the green Chile corn tamale. My bf didn't even finish Chile reano,  he said it was the worst he has had. Not once did the server come by to check on us for water, or to see how the food was. Not coming back"}
{"text":"It's ok at best. I had decent service, but found the food bland and generic. I don't plan on returning."}
{"text":"We were looking for a Mexican Restaurant the other day and we planing on going to other place but we couldn't remember the name. While driving back we ran across Manny's. It looked closed but it was a Monday Night. Once we got there it was open and we were both hungry. Place was empty except for a few families. Large menu with a lot of different options to pick from. Service, food, and portions were very nice. Prices were reasonable too. I bet we will be going back."}
{"text":"By far the worst food experience that I have had in AZ since moving here.  They should change thier name to \"American Caserols trying to be mexican\".  GROSS.  I ordered the seafood enchalada's.  That was my first mistake.  NEVER order seafood your first time at a restaraunt!  They were made with FLOUR tortilla's and the sauce was the conistency of OOBLECK (yes, that gross stuff you made in grade school by mixing cornstarch and water together).  The \"seafood\" was immitation crab and bay shrimp. It was so disgusting that I sent it back.  The waitress couldn't have cared less that I didn't like my food.  She just said \"ok, whatever\" and took it.  You couldn't pay me to go back this this place again!"}
{"text":"We went early and it wasn't busy at all. Service was friendly and quick. I had read earlier reviews that said you had to pay for chips and salsa, but that wasn't true. The margaritas were good, strong. The taco was ok... otherwise food was pretty good. What you might expect. I liked Manny's & had an overall good experience."}
{"text":"We've been here twice. Both times the food was great and the staff is friendly. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"bad food and bad service. Why is the price different when using a groupon?"}
{"text":"it was a quiet Monday (Columbus Day) and one kids meal is free per adult order on Mondays.  The food was very good.  They are not afraid of flavor or a moderate amount of spice here either!  The complimentary salsa (very tasty) and chips were very good.  The wait staff was attentive and pleasant. We'll be back"}
{"text":"Came for taco Tuesday and margarita 's -  no alcohol being served at this time, guy said maybe by next month.  Tacos and burritos we had were very poor quality.  Like store bought and zapped in microwave. Service was very good though so they get a second star for their staff."}
{"text":"We really enjoy Manny's and they not only have some really pretty good food, they have some cool specials during the week!  Tuesday is $1 Tuesdays, Wednesday $2 off combos and such specials thru the week.  There are plenty of regulars which also tells you that it is a place that is well liked.  They have a nice patio and good staff overall.  It may not be the best decor (not bad just a lot of red) within the restaurant but really you are there for the food!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I've ever had!!! Plus service was awesome. Ill definitely go back. It was clean, had a good atmosphere, and they were quick and efficient.  I love the chips and salsa especially the hot salsa."}
{"text":"We have been several times now and are always pleased with the food and service. A good reliable place to eat."}
{"text":"We have been going here for years. This is my daughters absolutely favorite place. I actually get burnt out as much as her and my husband want it lol. The staff is great. I love their food. Thank you"}
{"text":"Mannys is the best Mexican food around great busy atmosphere. Feels very family oriented . Food is outstanding! Fresh and served hot. Best chips and salsa and let me not forget the only place that makes great margaritas around this area. Can't beat the food, the margs and the great service. You must go if you have not! You will be happy you did. I bring everyone there who visits me from out of town and when they return they ask to go back."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Delicious margaritas and chicken tacos! The homemade chips and salsa are good too...it's mild, but good! It is the epitome of authentic Mexican food-tastes all homemade!"}
{"text":"We gave the food a star. Did not see if they had a cheese crisp on the menu, until we saw one brought out. We did not know Suisa Enchiladas came with Chicken in it. Chile relleno was good. Chicken was dried out in the fajitas. No alcohol, and it was never mentioned, until you arrived and saw a sign on the door saying no alcohol. If you go to the  Goodyear location ( wrong address on Groupon for the Goodyear location) Signs in restaurant all indicate they serve alcohol, but they must have lost their license. Service was great!"}
{"text":"Not a busy place for a weekend night. Food was below average and lacks freshness and flavor. Very small portions for the price. Margaritas are watered down would not go back and would not recommend to anyone unless they get a new menu and new cook."}
{"text":"I bought a Groupon for this and wish I never saw it!  Even if the food was FREE I would not go back.  The staff was half way pleasant but the place was dead and we had a hard time getting chips and drinks.  Service was horribly slow.  Now the food... the Mexican Pizza was blackened around the egdes and probably the best thing we had.  Their tacos were so wet that when you went to pick one up they bottomed out.  The chicken was flavorless and the beef even worse.  It had a horrible after taste that made you hesitant to even continue eating it.  Good thing is they had their liquor license.  Bad thing was I didn't get a drink!  I would probably still be waiting for it anyhow.  This place was a HUGE disappointment.  It wasn't worth it even with the Groupon.  We will never be going back."}
{"text":"Went to Manny's tonight place was dead had about 10 customers. Waited 5 minutes to be seated. Then waited to get drinks,there was only 2 people working there. Food was ok but the service was very slow. Could not get alcohol. I would not go back only reason i went tonight was for groupon."}
{"text":"We arrived at lunch time, were greeted and seated right away. Decor is a little dated, a lot of red. Seemed mostly clean. Restrooms clean. Server ok in the way of friendliness, drinks served very quickly. Food, ok. Nothing great. Jalapeño popper appetizer was probably frozen. Salsa, not that great. Entrees were fine- burrito and enchiladas. Friendly goodbye as we walked out the door. Had bought a Groupon, but we won't be back."}
{"text":"Arrived last night with a party of six. We had a great server; she was attentive and always kept making sure we were okay.  The food on the other hand was not that impressive. We ordered a lot of food, so here it goes. My dad ordered their shrimp cocktail/cerviche he said it was good but they didn't have any crackers to go with it for him. I ordered their chicken quesadilla and that was mouth watering delicious.  My daughters ordered the children's quesadilla meal and that was not very impressive. Two small flat grilled tortillas with a small amount of white cheese.  My parents didn't complain about their meal but didn't rave about it either.  I had the dinner #8 which was a green chili burro. I am a sucker for green chili burros and then one did not take the cut. The sauce inside was more like a gravy then a chili mixture. I didn't see any whole or sliced green chili's inside of it. The meat was not tender and was just chunks of meat.  This place has the potential to be a great Mexican restaurant yet they don't strive to be.  I doubt I will return to this place again."}
{"text":"I'm giving two stars because the food was absolutely delicious. However the service was severely lacking tonight. There were only three tables occupied but our server could not seem to keep our drinks or chips filled.  The table next to us received huge bowls of salsa and baskets heaping full of chips. Our chip basket literally had 10 chips in it every time they filled it and we got teeny little bowls of salsa. We were frequently without beverages while our server just stood in the corner.  We had to ask for every single refill he never observed when we were out. The last time we were at this restaurant they had signs posted everywhere announcing that they have 1 chip basket per table was allowed and any more would cost.  They finally removed those obnoxious signs but I guess maybe they are still struggling because they were very stingy with chips. The portion sizes were quite small as well and we left the restaurant hungry. I had been trying to give some business to a small local location but now I wish we had gone to a different Mexican restaurant where they were not so stingy. We purchased three meals and three beverages so it's not like we were trying to be cheap."}
{"text":"Horrible food.  Not sure what happened to this place but it used to have pretty good food. I took my family yesterday and my carnitas plate was burnt, my sons chicken tenders were burnt,   the rice tasted old, my tortillas were hard,  and my wife's taco meat was tasteless.  When I asked the waiter if we could exchange my son's tenders he took the plate back and brought them back looking even worse.  I will never return here and recommend you don't either, as the prices are pretty high for the quality of food."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I tried this place because we had a groupon for $40. Unfortunately everything is just a little bit over priced. Not a lot of value here. The food wasn't terrible, although it was kind of bland. We shared the Fajitas for Two. We also got some margaritas and chips/queso for an appetizer. I was surprised at how little we got for $40.  The margaritas were good, best part of the dinner. The queso was $6 and was nothing special at all. Just cheese. The sizzling steak/chicken Fajitas were ok but they didn't include very many bell peppers, just a lot of onions. The chichken was decent, the steak didn't look very appetizing and it was pretty chewy. Overall I probably wouldn't go back, mostly because it's too expensive for what you get. If it was a little cheaper I might've considered returning. Going to try Popo's, I've heard it's very good."}
{"text":"Food tastes like microwaved canned food, too much grease, no a.c. was on just fans so was very hot inside, only 1 person to take orders for the whole place. You're better off not coming here and just going to taco bell if you want bad Mexican food, at least there you know what to expect for the cheap food and it tastes better."}
{"text":"Let me start out by stating the food here was delicious . The service was horrible and i mean absolutely horrible! It has never been horrible like it was Thursday, Sept 21st. The wait staff was SLOW, Not engaging, Not present or friendly at all......UGH! I loathe horrible service, even if your food is good."}
{"text":"I don't know if a dining experience can get much worse. Suddenly i remember why i said i would never come here again! We arrived around 12:30 pm on  Sunday. My boyfriend wondered if they were even open, there were only a few cars in the lot. I suggested that would mean we get a good table and fast service. I was wrong on both accounts. There was only one other occupied table, they seated us right next to them. Great,  its hard enough to have a private conversation in public but impossible when the restaurant is practically silent and theres 2 tables sitting next to one another.  The food took forever,  over 35 minutes. So much for fast service. Everything was in slow motion. We had asked for water, that arrived after another request and right before we were done eating.  The cocktails were flat with no taste. First i tried one with club soda, no good. Then one with diet coke, worse. The food was just mediocre. Shrimp tacos room temp, which is fine with me but most people prefer hot food."}
{"text":"2nd try. Still not great, at all. Took son and family. Chips and salsa are complimentary, and this is good. I got albondigas, and I swear I taste bullion and the meatballs are frozen ones, I am quite sure. Enchilada suiza was boiled chicken with sour sauce (my fault, I thought suiza was white sauce) No black beans, which my 7 year old granddaughter loves. Edible but not a go-to place. Can't even get a beer or margarita, since they have no liquor license.... Still."}
{"text":"I used. Groupon for $40 worth of food so the price came out to about $22 for the Groupon purchase only had to pay two bucks which were the tax fees so total $24The food was okay the service was extremely bad the lady who served our food was on her phone while giving us the food  and the whole 45 minutes we were there we got asked once if everything was fine. The food could've been better to be honest, I had the \"Mannys Mexican burger\" the meat didn't even have enough flavor the bun was drenched with oil so the bun was soaked up In oil and it was just disgusting, my fries looked a day old and also drenched in oil 't side vegetables like lettuce and tomatoes look aged already. let me just say the pictures look better than what the food really looks like and the place was really empty me and my cousin were the only ones in there and yeah I wouldn't recommend this place at all. You are honestly better off eating at taco truck or Filiberto's"}
{"text":"Really good food for a spot that looks like its part of the bar next to it. Food is great portion ally and tastes amazing. Will be a new spot for me"}
{"text":"Well after a long day of moving,  we wanted beer n tacos.  Well this restaurant lost there liquor license. They have Letters up everywhere stating they don't serve alcohol yet they give you a money with alcohol beverages to order.  False advertisement. Good tacos though."}
{"text":"Used to eat here all the time but the last couple times they have been horrible. food tasted old and chips are not fresh anymore. maybe they changed cooksi dont know but they are not the same Manny's with awesome food and reasonably price. :(  Ive left a great review in the past and not my stomach churns every time we pas by this place :("}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food in the area.  It does serve alcohol and has an outside bar even though it is family friendly.  I recommend the fajitas and chi-mi's."}
{"text":"I love this place, it is family owned and operated last I checked and the food is great. It is more authentic than some of the larger chain restaurants and the services is always good too. They have awesome drink specials and they are pretty quick at getting your food out. They are not the cheapest game in town but one of my personal favs."}
{"text":"Bought a coupon from Groupon, food was good but not worth it without the coupon. Weird atmosphere in the place. Service was okay . Wouldn't come back ."}
{"text":"I so enjoyed my enchilada plate.  Their salsa is so fresh and their chips are extra yummy as well.  The server was very friendly and quick to take our order and refill our drinks!"}
{"text":"Super casual place, good food and great service. Great place to stop in with the wife and kids. Nothing fancy but a nice place to grab a good meal."}
{"text":"Too hot to sit outside on patio, but cant wait to return! Homemade chips n salsa, yum Patron Marg w grand marnier, delish Mini chimi's, Yum Steak dinner w flour tortilla, yummy! Cant wait to return!"}
{"text":"The staff was nice but not enough servers for the load of dinner patrons. We had the quesadilla (cheese crisp), Mexican pizza (cheese crisp with beans and greasy meat) and the fish tacos. The beans were good and tasted authentic but everything else was subpar. The chuck was greasy as was the fish, the two cheese crisps were overcooked and the rice had little flavor. Would be willing to give it another shot on a slower day but would definitely  suggest they get more kitchen staff to improve the food and more servers to handle the guests. Gordon Ramsey would have a field day with this place! They have so much potential given they have such a good location and loyal customers. Wish I could have given it a better rating."}
{"text":"I was here a few year back, but I was not a yelper yet and I cannot recall how the food was.  My MIL loves this place and I a GC from the restaurant.com so off we went.    The service and the food was better than I expected.  We ordered a manny's appetizer platter to share.  Not too shabby.  I got ordered the chicken chimi.  It was not too bad.  Good but nothing special."}
{"text":"So its a Wednesday night. Dont feel like cooking.  Found a Groupon.  Mexican sounds ok.  I scan the yelp reviews and figure its a gamble. So we decide to check it out. Well I am happy to report it was good. We both ordered enchiladas.  I have the three ameigos.  Beef chicken and cheese w all 3 sauces. The beef is shredded.  Tasted like beef stew meat almost.  It was good but my least favorite.  The chicken was shredded.  All white meat. Very tasty.  The green sauce was my favorite.  The white was good too. The red was my least fav.  Hubby liked his as well. We ordered soft drinks and 2 fried ice creams to go. It all came to about $38 So not bad with a groupon. Its a little high priced for the quality.  It was tasty but I prefer fresh high quality food. This is your standard American Mexican.  Not bad. Definitely recommend with a Groupon.  Service was great. The guy was very friendly.  I think he may have been the owner.   We were served in like 4 min. It was nutz. In and out of there in under 30 min. I left feeling lile a stuffed thanksgiving bird."}
{"text":"I've read through all of the reviews after buying a groupon for Manny's. I tried not to go in with any preconceived notions. First, they had no alcohol. I believe they are in the process of getting it but call first if you want a beer or margarita.  Now the review Food: was good. My wife had the chicken flauta dinner and I had street tacos. Everything came out very hot and very tasty. The chips were fresh and the salsa was pretty good. They have a spicy salsa if you ask for it.  Service: our server had the personality of Hillary on a sedative. Very \"as a matter of fact\" and to the point. However, we always had fresh drink refills and our order came out exactly as ordered. I believe there was one server for the whole place, two helpful bus boys and a helpful and friendly hostess.  It's hard to use the $40 groupon with 2 people and no alcohol so we saved it for their other location or when this one gets approved.  Either way we'll be back."}
{"text":"Went for lunch Yesterday with my wife and enjoyed everything! The place was clean the waitress was amazing and so was the cook! The food was tasty and perfect! We will be back soon!! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Manny was the worst Mexican restaurant I've been to hands down, no service, shit food and bad location....."}
{"text":"The wife and I used to come here every month or two. It was 15 miles away from my house but worth the drive! salsa is very good.  Most of the food I have tried has been outstanding! Very authentic we even had them cater a party for us and the food quality was excellent! now that I've moved out of state I really miss this place. did I mention that their service is amazing?  Always refilling drinks and checking on you. Owner works there most nights.  not surprising that they are opening a second location!!!"}
{"text":"This was a very cute place and the food was good for the price. There were three of us and we had the taco salad, rolled tacos, and chicken quesadilla. We were all pleased with our food and the service."}
{"text":"Had a great first experience, but won't be back. Waiter didn't deliver the right food that was ordered and the meat was very dry. Even with Groupon, not worth a return visit."}
{"text":"Checked it out because we had some time to waste. Food is pretty typical mexican cusine, nothing really stood out. The margaritas were cheap which I love. The fried ice cream was totally the best part!"}
{"text":"Despite some of the negative reviews, we had no issues with service or the food. The one comment I would make is that my chili relleno was very small compared to almost anywhere else I've had it. I always take home leftovers from a plate of food at a Mexican restaurant, and I had none left over this time My son had the two cheese enchiladas combo plate, he said it was really good, and he had leftovers. I did enjoy the green sauce on my relleno."}
{"text":"Guys I gotta admit, I was not expecting a great experience.  My parents wanted to go here so if course I hop on yelp and see the reviews and I was a little worried. But we had a good experience so I felt the need to speak up.  The chips and salsa were good.  They gave us extra and didn't charge (perhaps they're rethinking their policy?).  Food portions were small but so are the prices, so it all works out.  As far as taste and food quality, I've had better but believe me, I've had MUCH worse.  So I don't see what all the complaints are about.  It's your average Mexican food place but it for the bill when craving Mexican food.  Our service was good and they were very friendly.  Margaritas were good as well.  I like the patio, perhaps I will return when it's not so hot.   Maybe our experience was the off one. But it wasn't bad by any means."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch because I had a hankering for Mexican and a Groupon.  The service started out good but didn't finish that way.  We were honestly 7 minutes from dinning and ditching.  After we got our food we didn't see our waitress for another 30 minutes!  The food did not make up for it either.  I am pretty sure they microwaved everything.    I go out to dinner to get food better than what I can make at home and this fell way short of my standards."}
{"text":"UPDATE: I moved away from AZ last year and as soon as I got back, I just had to have these shredded beef tacos. I'm updating my review because their staff must have gone through retraining because the service was GREAT on my visit. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food I've had in Arizona. There is always great service and food."}
{"text":"Recently dined here and absolutely LOVED it! The waitress was extremely nice and got our order perfect. We had a big group and had several appitizers and food. Pricing was great for as much as we got! Walked away Fat, Dumb and Happy. The owner was really nice and made sure to walk around to each table to make sure everyone was happy. We will make several trips back! Thanks Manny's!!"}
{"text":"Always was hit n miss with this place. Sometimes good food, sometimes bad service, etc, etc.  We went with a Groupon, \"love em' and always r purchasing them for places\", anyhow, this visit put the cherry on top and NONE of us will ever be back. We went more than 15 minutes right in the middle of our meal without drinks, we finally were able to finish our food. My sons rice was crunchy and the chips were half stale. The server was playing both waiter and cook. People waited to be seated and a guy finally walked all the way into the kitchen just to say they were there and sitting down. When our check finally came, my son said to the waiter \"u took my crunchy rice and never brought out a replacement\", the waiter took 2 bucks off the tab. Now for the cherry on top; I noticed an almost 10 dollar service \"gratuity\" charge on the bill, I was like what, there was only 4 of us, not 8 or 10??????????  The server/waiter/cook said that since we are using a Groupon that they charge an 18% service charge cause Groupon users don't tip right!!! We always tip accordingly and I was like: Hey, u didn't mention nor does the restaurant mention ANYWHERE that an automatic service charge is applied! They are thieves! I contacted Groupon last night and sent them copies of everything and today I'm contacting the BBB and the attorney generals office. Sad, sad, sad! At this rate, that manny's will go outta business. Don't go, save urself the frustration of feeling belittled and unimportant and ripped off!"}
{"text":"Avoid this place. Food was disgusting. And made us sick. Its dirty and not very good customer service."}
{"text":"Worst experience at a Restaurant in a long time.  I got a groupon to take my family out for my sisters birthday and it was probably one of the worst gifts ever.  As soon as I presented the groupon the servers demeanor immediately changed.  The gratuity is a given 18% when using a groupon so I guess she knew at that point it wouldn't matter how horrible she treated us.    The busboy was continuously wiping down all the empty tables around us and completely ignoring we were out of chips and drinks even though he kept looking straight at our table.  Even though the crowd was very thin we still had to wait a very long time for our food without refills of drinks or chips and salsa.  The food was ok, nothing to write home about but not horrible.    The most horrible moment is when the check came and was a good $40 more than I expected.  This was after I had to wait another 25 minutes for the server to even bring the check even though they were taking away our plates before we were even done eating because it was 30 minutes to close.    A few people at the table ordered their combo burritos enchilada style and I was amazed they up charged $4 a piece for every meal that we asked they add sauce to.  The sauce was cold and there was no melted cheese as there should be for enchilada style.  They also charged $4 for a side of pico!! It ended up costing over $20 a person at the table for sodas and a combos that cost between $8.95-$10.95 each.    I will never step foot into this restaurant ever again.  Especially beware if you have bought a groupon, you will get the worst service of your life!!"}
{"text":"Place lost liquor license. We weren't interested in eating Mexican food without a drink..."}
{"text":"I've now tried Manny's twice...both times were equally terrible.  The food comes in at a decent price point but certainly not great.  Especially considering how hard it seems to be for them to get an order right, and or serve quality food.    I've had the fajitas, they were bland and boring.  There salsa is on par with the Pace you pick up at the grocery store.  We will not go back for a third try."}
{"text":"I ordered Manny's through UberEats... it was horrible! Uber was bad but the food even worse. I ordered queso dip and it came with out chips. I called Manny's and was told that if I wanted chips with my queso it would be extra.  Interesting...$7 for queso and no chips. Never in my life have I experiences such a crazy policy. I called and asked the chef about the chips...he stated that if I wanted chips with my queso it would be extra. Interestingly enough it wasn't on the menu as an extra. Will NEVER eat here again...food was average at best. Customer service was horrible."}
{"text":"Salty! I went for lunch with co-workers and was sadly disappointed. The salsa was mild to say the least. The lunch was waaaay overpriced! I tasted salt (literally) for days! I will not be back!"}
{"text":"Not sure why all the negative reviews. Been to Manny's many times and always leave happy and full. Food is awesome and service attentive especially when \"papa\" is there"}
{"text":"This place has great food. Love the feel and look of this place. The outside dining area is a bit small. We opted to sit inside because there was a family sitting out there and their child was having a melt down and screaming and crying.  Service is fast, but our waiter has the interpersonal skills of a door knob. Work on it!!!"}
{"text":"No Buena !  Rice was okay and chips were okay. I won't be returning  Made me sick all night  ;("}
{"text":"We have been coming here for a couple of years.  The food has always been good, but lately I have noticed an extra effort on a part of the staff to be more attentive and professional.  We also noticed that the menu has been completely revamped.  The food is very fresh and the chips were light, crispy and warm.  Prices are reasonable too."}
{"text":"where do I start? I've seen coupons for this place and wanted to try it for a while. Upon trying it, I was not impressed! I ordered a chile relleno and my guest had a taco and burro combo. When my relleno came, i noticed a couple of hairs on the chile, two thick hairs on the top and a few on the bottom. I told them about it and requested a new one. Moments later, server comes back with the same plate and tries to prove me wrong saying, \"those aren't hairs, they're parts of the chile. see, there's some up here too!\". I've worked with roasted chile, many times before and I can tell you, chile isn't supposed to look like that. These guys haven't heard of \"the customer is always right.\" . I sent that back and got the same as my guest. In the end I had a Groupon that was 10 for 20. the bill came out to be $19.65. When my bill came, I gave them the code for the group on and thought all I'd have to pay is the tip. The server then told me I owed her $1.75 for tax because she claims \"Groupon doesn't cover tax\". The only reason I disputed this was because I've used groupons at other places and even if the bill is under, they always take care of the tax. So my guest covered it, they accidentally gave them $4 to cover they're unearned $2 tip. When I left I called the manager and complained, turned out the manager, Crystal, was the one who was serving me this whole time. I addressed my concerns and every time I told her a point she would cut me off and try to defend herself saying I was wrong and they were right. Obviously poor customer service. I was not yelling at her or being disrespectful or mean in any way and the manager kept cutting me off and arguing with me on the phone. I got fed up, so I told her my final concern and told her I was never coming back and hung up the phone before she cut me off again. I WILL NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN!!! I'm glad that I said loudly, \"I'm never coming back!\" as I walked out the door, maybe some other people will start seeing the same poor service in these guys."}
{"text":"Ordered Chicken quesadillas and received cheese crisps, they said if we drive back they would make them again and charge us extra for the chicken.never going back"}
{"text":"One of the best if not the best mexican food in arizona. Authentic as it gets and clearly explains why its always busy. If your looking for quality service and good food, then be patient of you have to wait because its definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Always a quiet setting with great food and amazing service. Love going here. The fajitas are my favorite and the street tacos are awesome as well. Great prices."}
{"text":"the food was bland and uninspired. the service was quick and friendly. another reviewer hit the nail on the head with the salsa comparing to pace from the supermarket. we ordered: a tostada, steak & chicken fajitas, the #1 which is a cheese enchilada and a beef taco, and chicken strips & fries for our little terror tots. again i find myself agreeing with another reviewer-$2.50 for a bloody soda is a bit pricey as well. the husband asked for a wee bit more sour cream and guac. to top off his last fajita...the server brought them quickly, however they were huge portions and ice cold-which he then decided to charge an additional $5 for. it's a good thing i didn't marry a sucker, after arguing with the waiter, the manager complied...however, it didn't come off of the 18%% gratuity that the waiter automatically received from our coupon. next time i want mexican food i'll drive to 67th and indian school and go to popo's...they never fail to deliver."}
{"text":"I bought a groupon for this place and we decided to to head out on a Sat night, after reading reviews here i was a little concerned, it did take longer than average for them to get to us and get us at a table over all maybe ten min, this was long due to their being no lines or waiting guest. There was five of us and we got a mix of food, after asking everyone their thoughts we all agree that the food was very good, plenty of flavor and portions size was ample that everyone left full, also the server was right on time and very accommodating to our needs, I had the red chili burro and it was very good actually it was the best I have found here in the valley, I am used to the style from Globe and Miami Arizona and it was comparable, I would say give the place a try, I will return if just for Their red Chile"}
{"text":"I'm a bit shocked the average rating is just 3 of 5 stars. My family and I went to Manny's and thought it was great all around. The food was tasty, the staff was attentive and the prices seemed appropriate (I did not have a Groupon). I mean, isn't that what you'd expect?   We'll be going back (and with a Groupon it'll be even better.)"}
{"text":"This place gets some bad reviews, and I don't understand why. Obviously, they are successful or they wouldn't be opening up a SECOND and NEW location nearby on McDowell Road!!   I have been going to Manny's for many years. I love their chicken enchiladas with the cream sauce, their cheese enchiladas with red sauce, their tacos, rice and beans and fajitas! They serve good chips and salsa!  So, my advice is to ignore the negative complainers and give it a try!!"}
{"text":"Food was terrible! $2.50 for a drink! Would not recommend. Never ever going back gross and terrible service."}
{"text":"So, this was a three star place to begin with; sorta average, but consistent.  Then, for a long time, they didn't have any alcohol and I love beer with my tacos. So, we hadn't been here in a while. I think they transferred the liquor license to their new restaurant and had to wait to get another, but maybe they just lost their license for a while...who knows?  At any rate, we went in here last night, and this place is disgusting. To begin with, there are home printed signs saying that they now charge for chips and salsa, after the first two baskets. I don't really care about the policy, but add it to your menu, not tape pieces of paper throughout the restaurant; that is just tacky. Oh, and the financial difficulties, if they exist, are likely not due to the free chips, but the lousy food and lack of adult beverages for the past year.  About those chips: they seemed unnaturally hard and the salsa, as it always has, lacks flavor. We ordered some hot salsa to liven it up. Problem was, the hot salsa tasted like it had cleaning solution in it...really really bad. My wife thinks it has sat in a can for too long, but I think they mixed Windex with it.  Our order consisted of shredded beef tacos, tostada, and a chicken flauta.   The beef tacos were overcooked the point of ridiculousness. I picked one up and it cracked along the bottom and split in two. This left me eating half of it like a taco cracker, while discarding the other side. The meat also didn't take kindly to the extra cook time and was a significantly more crispy than I like shredded beef to be. This is also a strange sized tortilla; in between a street taco and a normal taco; like you might find on an appetizer taco. These same shells were used in the tostada and flauta as well.  When I picked up the tostada, the tortilla could not support the topping, bent in two and dumped the contents onto the plate. So, a deconstructed tostada is what I had. This is quite literally, the easiest thing to make; seriously?  The flauta was edible, though overcooked with dry chicken. The tortilla size again made this seem like an appetizer.  We seriously thought; wow, what a waste of calories, money and time. We will not be back and just hope that they close this location and let somebody who gives a damn open a new restaurant because it appears that they have stopped trying."}
{"text":"Delicious and comfortable. Great food and service. We will be back.  I had a chimichanga w shredded beef, my daughter had a bean burrito and ate the whole thing. Good stuff"}
{"text":"We come here about once a month for lunch.  I've noticed a big decline in service and food however today the food was great and service was on point.   There is usually only one server around lunch and usually they are running around or not attentive and food served cold.   Our girl today was good, food took too long for a baja quesadilla but it was SO GOOD!!!"}
{"text":"Place lost its liquor license. The only thing I can say is that at least they tell you right when you walk in the door. We went to the new one on Van Buren nothing much to say about that one that's all that great either."}
{"text":"Their service is great, and the happy hour or groupon specials make it a decent value.  Without any 'discounts', I am not impressed enough with the food to return continuously.  I live close by, and so I have visited Manny's at least 7 times before writing this review. The salsa is great, and they have awesome shrimp fajitas.  However, their cheese dip appetizers are very mediocre.  I absolutely love cheese dip, and so to find it so bland here was a huge disappointment.  The beans and rice are also on the bland side.  Personally, their food is nothing to write home about--with so many Mexican cuisine options in Phoenix, Manny's disappoints.  However, the beer is always cold, the service is welcoming and the location are all reasons I would return.  ****avondale location does not serve alcohol any longer...2 stars because the food is mediocre. The service is generally good, though"}
{"text":"Their hours of business are stated on Yelp and the restaurant itself as 11am to 9pm for Mondays. Arrived at this place at 8:20pm last night and the shades were all pulled down. Entered the dining room, there was one family eating their meal, told the server party of two and he stated they were closed and the food had all been put away. When I pointed out it was only 8:20 he shrugged and repeated they were closed.  This is actually the 2nd time this has happened recently (750 pm) so it appears that they just close whenever they feel like it. Very disappointing and very unprofessional in my opinion. I wonder if the ownership is even aware of this situation (?)"}
{"text":"We had a Restaurant.com gift certificate, so we went out to see if they were any good.  We visited just before Christmas...so I can't recall specifics. However, the food was decent. Nothing spectacular, but wasn't bad either. The real turnoff here was the service. Slow. Really slow...and this was on a night that had about 6 tables seated.   What really stuck in my mind was the 10 minutes and two requests it took to get my credit card back from the waiter when I paid. The last request he looked at me like \"whaddya want?\"   We will not be back."}
{"text":"My wife got a deal on groupon for this place, so we decided to check this place out. The ambience was nice with lots of seating. The food was average at best, but at least they were kind hearted people, and the owner was very nice as well. Will come back a few more times hopefully to bump up my review."}
{"text":"Awesome food Love the their chip and home made salsa It's free too  I can eat that all day They should be charging for that good food I would pay for it Tried their chicken and beef tacos cause they are awesome"}
{"text":"Food is terrible waiter rude busboy cool. Should have looked at the reviews before I came"}
{"text":"Worst service every. No AC in the restaurant, they had a server who is wiping his head and then touching plates and cups. Our server didn't speak any English and said we had to speak Spanish to him. We asked for lemonade and were told they only had ice tea. Seconds later another server brings out pink lemonade for another table. When we showed our server the tray of lemonade, he still said they only had ice tea. We asked for 3 salsas and he brought 14. As we were still trying to order our drinks, our server walked away and left us talking to ourselves. Then we go and let the manager know that we aren't happy with the service we have received so far and to also let him know we would be leaving and he said.... Ok bye! Do not go there... Stay away... Spend ur $ else where!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. It can be months since we've visited yet they remember who we are. Prices are more than fair and it's worth the drive every time. When people are looking for good non-chain Mexican food, this is where we send them."}
{"text":"$9 Chimi and $2.50 coke, plus tax and tip... where am I eating at right now?  This isn't exactly the high rent district out here on Indian School road halfway between the 101 and Dysart Rd.    Chips were rather dry and resembled the generic brand ones that come in a bag modestly labeled 'chips' that my in-laws buy.  Salsa was fresh (good onion & tomato), but the Chimi, beans, rice, and service were just average.  I'm not sure why the other reviewers found the price to be just right.  I fear that this place enjoys inflated review scores because it's down in the Avondale/Goodyear area with so little decent competition."}
