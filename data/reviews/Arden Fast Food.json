{"text":"This is one of my go to pace for cheap chibese take out.   the only place that makes   Ketchup deep fried boneless  chicken on rice.   They make a good honk kong tea also.   They have loyal clientele so foe bust times on weekend and weekdays after 5:45 call 10 minutes in advance so yiu don't have to wait that long .   Other good  menu item are pan friend noodles.   It is a dated food court so bathroom  are so so.  But they just gutted it last month.  But it is icky again.   So many people take out and eat at the comfort of their own home.     This place is solid since they lasted here along with the bbq inside the food court.    Other have come and gone.  Most dishes are lest the $7 which includes a soya drink , hk tea or lemon tea"}

{"text":"I think this place serves HK cafe style fast food based on my basic understanding of Cantonese food; ordered Western style fried rice (sai caau faan) and hot and sour soup; fried rice was was tasty with great portion but my partner said he did not like the taste of the hot and sour soup.  So food was decent here. Why two stars only, you may wonder?   Reason was the cleanliness of the food court: actually last time I was coming for the rice noodle rolls at Da Ke Yi in the same food court, it wasn't that bad. But this time it was so gross I was able to remember clearly; there was uncleaned food mess on most tables and I could see oil dripping down the waste bin in front of me while I was eating. It was that disgusting. Wish I took a picture of it for Yelpers to see.  Very unfortunate as the food is actually not bad, and the main point of my review is not meant to be critical of the food quality from the particular food joint. My advice is to order takeout maybe if you crave their food as the hygiene in the food court could kill your appetite."}
{"text":"My family has been visiting this place ever since I was a child, and yes that is quite a number of years ago I shall say hehe. So why the high rating? This place is always consistent with the quality of their food, especially because of their Wok Hay (Wok Heat), which makes their dishes so much better. My family usually orders the take out combos, and my go-to dish is always the Eggplant and Beef with Thick Noodles. They tend to get very busy during dinner time, and the lady taking the orders isn't always the friendliest, but hey from a take out joint, it's the food that matters most. The only downside is that it is located in a small food court, so there is limited seating."}
