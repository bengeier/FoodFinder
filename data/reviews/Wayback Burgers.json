{"text":"Burgers are ok, nothing great. Fries were a bit soggy. Staff all friendly. Waited a long time for my burger. Just like Five Guys, the burger feels like a weight in the pit of your stomach an hour after eating and you smell like a burger the rest of the night."}
{"text":"Hands down the best burger I have ever had.. And I've had a lot of burgers in my days.. The milk shakes were perfect and yummalicious. 10/10- would go again.. I loved it and such a cute place.. My whole family was proud of the idea to go there and try it, we all enjoyed it. The prices were cheap for the taste."}
{"text":"Overall it was good. Has a similar concept too 5 Guys with a larger menu. Burgers are a smaller then 5 Guys and not cooked as long so they are juicier. They are also a little less expensive. Similar lunch was $2 less."}
{"text":"I've had great experience both times I've been. The staff are friendly and helpful. The December special burger (on pretzel bread) was simply amazing (can this be on the regular menu? If so I'd get it all the time) as was the Carolina burger that I had the second time I went. Both times there was a bit of a wait, but it's made to order so I didn't mind waiting since it was so fresh when it came to my table. Yes, it's a bit pricier than the typical fast food burger, but you're not getting a typical fast food burger. Much, much better!"}
{"text":"M first time here and I had the Veggie Burger and the Chili....both were delicious!! The choices are not just beef burgers. They have turkey, cod, chicken, & veggie and hot dogs. Also on the menu is are a variety of shakes, fries, & onion rings. The ambience is clean, friendly, modern way back. TV. I'll be back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"My bacon burger was delicious!! I ordered a single but next time I will order a double. I felt like the meat on the single wasn't enough. There homemade chips were amazing and I also ordered a milkshake and it was to die for. I can't wait to come again and eat another burger. A great new burger joint in Matthews"}
{"text":"Plain, no kick no punch
Don't bother ordering the Buffalo chicken sandwich dry and no buffalo sauce taste in it.

Single burger ok...
Fish sandwich ....hmm poor on taste..plain.
Fries...etc."}
{"text":"Employees were nice, hubbys $3.00 small milkshake was good, my root beer was good, and that's all the good I can say about it. My burger was not good, the pickles aren't good (rather than hamburger dill chips, these were like Clausen pickle chips) and somehow, the lettuce was bitter. Hubby's Buffalo chicken sandwich was horrible. It wasn't like a chicken breast, more like \"chicken crackling\" and drowned in Buffalo sauce and some other white sauce. No need for a repeat visit."}
{"text":"The food is very good here.
The shakes however, are out of this world! I had oreo Mississippi Mud and it was incredibly thick and tasty.
We will be back soon."}
{"text":"There are many better burger places to try than this one. I asked for a well done burger - they literally didn't understand me and had to get guidance from the manager. The mushrooms on my burger were canned. Bland food isn't my thing. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Not very clean. Pepsi, not Coke. They charge for BBQ sauce if you want it on the side. Never again for an overlooked burger."}
{"text":"We went to the Matthew's location on its grand opening night and the place was packed. Despite it being their first night on the job with a line out the door, the staff was incredibly nice and the food was delicious. The onion rings were amazing and the milkshakes crazy good."}
{"text":"Came here with the family they treated my kids well. The food was i think a little on the expensive side, however when i read they donate to veteran groups, that won me over being a vet myself.  I got the carolina butger, it wasnt too bad pretty good. I would order it again. The slaw was good."}
{"text":"Burgers and buffalo chicken sandwich were very disappointing!  Milkshake and homemade chips were pretty good."}
{"text":"Had a cheeseburger and hotdog.  The hotdog was very good. The slaw and chili had great taste.  The single burger seemed a little small and thin, but it was good also. Everything is fresh and made to order."}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular about the place but:
Pros:
Generous portions of fries that are pretty good.
Homemade chips are pretty good as well.
Buns are tasty.
Shakes have pretty good flavor
Service is usually friendly and quick.
Cons:
Burgers are smaller than the buns
Slightly expensive
Shakes are high for portions
It's just a burger regardless of which you get."}
{"text":"We had lunch here a few weeks back and it was great! We each had a burger and I had fries and my wife had onion rings. We also each got a shake and they were delicious. The manager (owner?) greeted us and explained the menu and was very friendly. Overall, great experience and will be back though it was a bit pricey...."}
{"text":"I ordered the original wayback burger which comes with two beef patties,  lettuce, tomato, mustard, pickle, and onion along with your choice of cheese on a soft fresh made roll. (You also get your choice of sides which includes french fries,  homemade chips, chili cheese fries,  or just cheese fries or for something different fried macaroni and cheese) I chose the fresh cut french fries which are made in house. Now I know you're thinking just another burger joint but in this case you'd be wrong this burger is delicious fresh not frozen made to order right in front of you. The staff is very friendly very helpful and just overall pretty amazing I have to say wayback burger is one of the best burgers I've eaten in a really long time. Do yourself a favor and get there as soon as you can!"}
{"text":"Great hamburger!  Nice and juicy, done just right, with crispy bacon!  Fries were good, and counter staff was very friendly and helpful.  Plenty of parking was available, so that always helps too."}
{"text":"Great service and food.  Buffalo chicken sandwich was great.  Office is not far from here so I will definitely be back to try the burger."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. There is only one register and I had to wait for 10 minutes while a customer placed an order.  I just ordered the Carolina burger and nothing else. It cooked up pretty quick but the bun was cold and falling apart. Maybe if the bun was toasted it might hold together better. The meat had no flavor and the slaw and chili were falling out the sides of the burger which helped cause the bun to fall apart. Won't go back when there are better and cheaper burgers down the road at Showmars."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good , nice fresh juicy burgers . The fires are  tasty as well, they are a bit pricey but it is worth it for fresh burgers . I also was impressed the cleanest of the restaurant . The staff was okay one girl seemed a little overlay friendly . A tad fake or maybe it was just me . But I will be going back ."}
{"text":"Burgers are pretty good. Not mind blowing but pretty good. Chips and or fries are extra which perturbs me since the regular double burger is about $7. Employees are nice and food came out fast. Fries are average."}
{"text":"So good. The concept of a hamburger with the bun reversed with cheese blows my mind. Taste like a grilled cheese with hamburger. I love this place. The burgers are very good. The fries are great!"}
{"text":"Only okay. Burger was edible but not awesome. Fast food in a small restaurant. Too loud and crowded. Onion rings are good."}
{"text":"Why is it that some Transplants feel the need to a la carte a simple burger into $$, for mediocrity from hell. Ain't a cereal aisle and frozen onion rings? Balls, stooooopid and good luck. Wayback needs to get waaaayback to the drawing board. Can't even do a Patty Melt right and this franchise is a northern franchise??!!! 
Later taters, hope your lease isn't long term. $$wasted big time!"}
{"text":"Our burger and grilled chicken sandwich were okay. Nothing special. The service was great! We loved the milkshakes! Would come back for those but not for the food."}
{"text":"Hehehe...
Never had the Carolina Burger before but I was surprised how well the coleslaw and the chili mixed together on the patties. I recommend eating this burger with the buns flipped upside down like the Cheeesy Burger. Trust me, it's a lot easier to handle. Lots of flavors, looks messy, but tastes amazzzzzzzzzing. Service was great and clean all around."}
{"text":"We drove past this place a few days ago and flagged if as a place we wanted to try. Today we went for lunch and it was delicious! My kids loved their kids meals - budge and chicken tenders - and my wife and I thought the burgers were great! This is better than five guys in my opinion...no it's not the best burger place ever, but for the area, it's very good! ORDER THE CHILI CHEESE FRIES AND THE MILKSHAKES! (Caps for emphasis) The staff was super friendly. It's new, but the place is super clean and decorated really well. We will come back!"}
{"text":"Great place to get a burger, fries (personally i always substitute the mac n cheese bites) and a milkshake in the Matthews area.  Their Carolina Burger is really good for upscale fast food!"}
{"text":"Great burgers but at an expensive price. Wayback is a great place in that ingredients are fresh and each burger is made to order. Family friendly and in a nice part of town (downtown Matthews). My only gripe is that prices are way too high for the \"quality\" of food - i.e. you're paying high prices for regular burgers, nothing special in terms of ingredients ( ex. coleslaw, cheese, bacon, the usual ). To have a burger and side and drink will probably cost you $12-$13 which is more than I'd like to pay at a fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"Food isn't bad the service is super slow! Don't go if it's even remotely busy bc it's going to take a while!"}
{"text":"I was there and  my husband and I had   Philley cheese steaks .  They were so good. My mouth is watering to come back and get another. The restaurant was very clean when I was there, and the staff  couldn't have been friendlier. it's easy to pig out someplace that is so good.  The onion rings are delicious. They have milkshakes that are made the old fashion way,  handicapped ice cream. So  nummy!"}
{"text":"Nestled along the North Trade development (near Jet's and Which Wich), Wayback can almost not be seen from the street - in fact had we not turned around, we probably would not have gone in, as we had no idea they were there. However, since we hadn't had a burger for a while, we decided to give them a try.

When we got to the counter, their menu is both simple (for signature burgers) and potentially complex (for the build-your-own variety). If you build your own, most topping are included at no additional cost, which is nice, and if you're not in the mood for burgers, they also have other sandwiches, including chicken, turkey, veggie, fish and even hot dogs, so there is a reasonable variety here.

We were there on a day when they were having problems with their systems, and so the preparation took a while and I also had to go back to the front and run the credit card again. I later checked to make sure that we weren't double-charged (we weren't). The staff was nice through the whole process, and the food was solid, if not particularly memorable. I assume this does not happen regularly, but we have not been back since to try again - but all was handled well enough that it's reasonable to assume that we will if we're in the area."}
{"text":"I had heard about this place an last night me an a friend drove out to Matthews to check it out.  They were running a special BOGO double bacon burger with the purchase of a side an drink.  First seems the young man on the register was new an in training.  He had ask another guy about it an he was like yeah we have that. Alright lol we order our burgers an drinks an fries he says 20.00 I said thats BOGO mmm here was the catch it was buy a burger an get one you just had to buy a drink an side.  Than it was 16.00 okay better price. But when we asked questions about the food since it was our first time the new employee didnt know which when I used to work in eateries they let us try food so we would know.  He asked the other employee an being he was busy cooking he could barely answer us really!! Finally a mgr is what she looked like came out an seemed to know much more than these other 2 or should I say friendly:) The burgers were good an juicy just as we ordered but it was just a burger I wont drive all the way to matthews just to go here again.  Fries are not fresh just frozen dumped in the fryer they were good  If your in that area an want a burger try it , there are alot of new places in matthews to try :)"}
{"text":"Ok, ok, ok I know I am a vegetarian at a burger place...but come on- they should have at least one good thing on the menu for me to eat-but no-no sirE! I tried the garden salad and it was just the lettuce, tomato, and onion they put on the burgers. The honey mustard dressing was so thick and almost frozen I couldn't even pour it on my salad. The only reason that I gave them two stars is because my family said the burgers were \"ok\" I don't think we will be back. It was an over rated steak and shake. The bathrooms were dirty and the food took a very long time to get to us. The staff was not the nicest either."}
{"text":"Wow what great burgers.  Hadn't planned on finished the Carolina but I did!  Couldn't stop myself. They also have excellent milk shakes and malts made with REAL ice cream. Looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"First time here, it was great! Had the Cheesy burger- it was delicious! Kids had cheeseburgers and hot dogs and loved them. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Great burgers! They are always flavorful and filling. Their onion rings are some of the best around. Yes it's more expensive but you get what you pay for. Want a cheap burger? Go to McDonalds. The grilled chicken Caesar was great too. The chicken was nice and hot and tasted good. The dressing was creamy."}
{"text":"Strolled in here with a buddy one night after work in search of some mouthwatering burgers as depicted through pictures. Instead we were thoroughly disappointed. For what is supposed to be a somewhat quick in and out burger joint we waited 20 minutes for my friends burger to come out. That being said he was finished with his by the time mine was placed In front of me. They even forgot we ordered milkshakes and that just took even longer. Food was okay but still left hungry. For the style of the place you are way better off heading over to five guys. Prices are extremely high for what you get."}
{"text":"First visit tonight.  Buffalo chicken sandwich was ok, cheese fries ok. Dad got philly, it didn't look good at all, craft singles under the meat not even melted.  Onion rings were probably the best thing.  Not likely to go back."}
{"text":"I tried the CHEEEESY burger with Swiss cheese. I loved the \"inverted bun.\"  It was unique and the texture worked. I also loved the fries. I liked the burger, but found it too oily (greasy) for my taste. I'm guessing the excess oil was due to the four slices of cheese. So, for me, I don't think I'll order this burger next time. I will update my review after trying a different burger. I also appreciated the presentation. The old newspaper was a cool touch."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers, cooked and seasoned to perfection. Their menu is simple, but dependably good. Food is fresh and the interior is clean and well kept. We enjoyed the nice little outdoor seating area and helpful staff. Service is incredibly fast...Wayback is a good alternative to your typical fast food burger joint."}
{"text":"I was excited about a new burger spot in Matthews but was disappointed in the flavor and prices of wayback burger . The customer service was great, so I gave 1star just for that . I really felt like none of our burgers had a distinct flavor  . Definitely not worth the $30 we paid for, the fries deep fried in oil that came along with the order had no flavor beyond the grease we had to sprinkle too much salt and add more than ketchup . 

I ordered the \"Philly\" an all beef two patty burger with mushrooms and sauteed onions , where were the mushrooms , and they definitely came from a can or jar :( . My daughter got the jalapeno burger , hmmmmmmmmmm same burger as mine with a few slices of jar jalapenos , double sad face ! The buns were your basic store bought buns , the bottled water was like being at a Panthers game , Jeez I could've purchased an entire pack from the supermarket . I really was hoping to give an outstanding review but when you have 2 other individuals not enjoying their bland burger patties with limited toppings , what can you do ."}
{"text":"Took the family out to lunch last weekend at this burger joint. Kids love love loved it. They got great diner style burgers on super soft rolls with yummy french fries and chocolate shakes.   Definitely a feeling lunch. No need for dinner that night ha ha."}
{"text":"My family and I were looking for a different burger place other than the staples we have been going to.  Unfortunately we tried Way Back Burgers.  We were really let down after being excited after seeing the pictures online.  Food was way to pricey for what you get, and we do not mind paying for quality food.  No cheddar cheese is available, only American, Swiss or Pepper Jack, that is just gross.  The burgers were overly greasy, more than your standard greasy spoon.  The bun was extremely soft, like it had been microwaved for about 2 minutes.  We got the chili cheese fries, which were just terrible and caused major indigestion.  The milkshake may have been the worst part.  We got a Jr size for 2.99, and the cup was about the same size of the small clear water cups you get at most places (we compared and they were very close).  The strawberry flavoring tasted like syrup.   

The good: service was ok, and the place was clean.  The bad: everything else.  The ugly: no \"way back\" vintage decor or ambience, unless you count the weird posters of kids and Pac-Man.  The music was awful.  I thought the staff had chosen the pop music playing (feat. Miley Cyrus!), but after every few songs, the \"DJ\" proudly announced you were listening to Way Back Radio and then ran an ad.  Not very vintage.  Please stay away.  I recommend almost any other burger place, including most fast food places.  In the Matthews area, Fuddruckers or Moo-Yah are much, much better and the same price or cheaper for way better food."}
{"text":"This place is sincerely good.  I put them as ALMOST on the same level as Five Guys.  The burgers are really good and the milkshakes are awesome.  Also, they have a better selection than Five Guys (chicken options, dressed fries, milkshakes, other sandwiches, etc).  The staff was super friendly.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Great stop for burgers, fries and more. I wasn't brave enough to try the triple triple, which consists of 9 burger patties...next time! Chili fries were great, as was the American Heroes burger! Everyone was very friendly, including the owner. Stop and give them a try....I will be back!"}
{"text":"Okay, upon entry, no greeting. I approach the counter and place my order. After waiting 18 minutes , my order arrives and it's not the way I ordered it. Instead of waiting any longer, I eat the burger. It was ok at best but nothing to brag about.  Fries were lukewarm at best and considering the 18 minutes I waited, they should've been piping hot! At these prices, they may want to really step their game up. Enhance customer engagement,  suggestive sell and most of thank your guest for patronage of your product. I could've gone elsewhere and not only received better service, but it wouldn't have been a disappointment. I'll return just to give you another chance to redeem yourselves but YOU BETTER BE ON YOUR A GAME!!"}
