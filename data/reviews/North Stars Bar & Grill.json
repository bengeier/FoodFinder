{"text":"Under new management. The quality of the food is decent at best. The burger and fries were just okay, actually the fries weren't good, which is a pretty bad sign. the calamari was barely breaded and looked more like mashed squid and fried batter. The service however, is tremendous. They pour cold beer in iced glasses and play sports on the television better than most joints."}
{"text":"A nice quaint place. The Monday-Wednesday special is great 1lb wings and $5 steam whistles. The wings are really good, and the device is decent."}
{"text":"Man, do times change. So after Joseph and Susan took off, there's all of a sudden teriyaki, bulgogi and other asian dishes added to the menu. Can't say if they're good or not as me and a friend were in a hurry to leave because the game has started and the place became loud as hell. I remember the old times when we could sit for hours at the bar and Joseph kept feeding us pitchers. Miss those days. But, for those of you who like a good sports bar, this is what has become. Come in and try, don't take my word on it.  As for me and my friend, we ended up going to lcbo and drinking beer in the park."}
{"text":"This is a small local pub that shows sports and tends to have a more blue collar crowd in a not so blue collar area. Cheap prices and standard pub fare on the menu, the food doesn't stand out, pretty much your run of the mill pub. The owner works here everyday and is quite friendly, she tries to make people feel at home. She will often bring out some complimentary fries or pretzels for patrons when drinking beer and chat a bit here and there. A great place to go if your looking for a small cozy little bar you can call your own lol it's small enough if your a regular they should all know you in no time"}
{"text":"Came here to watch an MMA event on a Saturday night. The place was much smaller than I expected, but it was still a good size for a sports bar.   Service was decent. The owner forgot to bring me a glass of water after I asked for one, but the other waitress's were attentive and friendly.  Food was also fairly good. It was pretty much your standard sports bar food. I had the fish and chips. The entrees were a little overpriced in my opinion.  The music was playing very loud for the whole night but it wasn't so bad since I was there alone. However, I could tell that it would have been difficult to have a conversation with a friend.  All in all,  a decent place to go to if you want to catch the game/fight alone, however there are better places in the area to visit for UFC fights."}
{"text":"Cheap drinks, cool location, okay patio, super cute and sweet server, whats not to love?  I'm pretty sure they made a mistake on our bill..  We had 2 pitchers of Canadian, a Caesar salad and a plate of pretty much the worst nachos Ive ever had, but I forgive it, for under 40 bucks?  I will defo be back here. Its cute + cheap + convenient.   Also, why did I have to google how to spell Caesar. What's wrong with me."}
{"text":"I really like this bar: good food, reasonably priced, awesome jukebox and handsome female bartenders. The owners are nice too."}
{"text":"Terrible service. They can only serve bottles of beer and bar rail shots. No creativity or skill with cocktails. And everything is watered down. Food is typical fried crap, but they will only make it if 'they have time'. Deplorable. The woman who owns the place, 'Angie' is rude and apparently overcharges customers on a regular basis. Beware!"}
{"text":"Got a burger. First time here. Bathroom air dryer has cancer. Burger was steller and fries were nice. Probably gonna come back for a pint and to watch next year's hockey"}
