{"text":"Love it here! The stallion smoothie is amazing!!!!! They have tons of options and I like everything I have tried.  That however is a must try. I go there after my weekend workout for it"}
{"text":"I love this place!! I could not wait for it to open - it's exactly what Strongsville needed!"}
{"text":"3-Stars but hopefully improving as the potential is certainly there. 

Recently opened on Pearl Road in Strongsville, Octane Performance Cafe is looking to corner the underserved market on quality coffee and healthy, alternative meals from breakfast through dinner. 

I've been to Octane twice now; once for a smoothie, and once for a quick and light breakfast. The smoothies were delicious both times (Strawberry Banana, and Acai Energy), and my breakfast (Turkey Sausage Burrito) was also very good. I have yet to try their coffee, but I will certainly be coming back in the next week or so to try it. If it's truly a quality bean, Octane is onto something that the community is certainly lacking in a good coffee house. 

The only thing holding them back is a \"system.\" The staff were friendly and helpful, but the wait for the food (I was there with 2 other guests) was painfully slow and the food was not served together (or close together). The girls were doing there best, I think, but we were the only customers there at the time, and it just seemed that they lacked the right direction (not to mention that one of the sandwiches was missed altogether on the initial order, and had to be reordered). 

I'm a huge fan of the idea and I'm sure it will catch on. If they're able to get a manager on staff that can actually manage the store, I think Octane will become a great success."}
{"text":"Yummy! The food portions are generous, the atmosphere is inciting, very clean and modern open feel. The Octane Mocha either blended or on ice is AMAZING!! The staff is inciting, upbeat and helpful. The gorilla smoothie is awesome! I'm from Seattle and the major coffee companies have nothing on Octane. Did I mention, I gave up coffee 15 years ago?! They have converted me."}
{"text":"Love this place!  They are fast, fresh, and healthy.  The staff was helpful and excited about being opened.  They have a coffee bar and a cafe.  Prices are reasonable.

I always judge my coffee on if it is just as good cold as it is hot & this place past the test.  The coffee was a local brew and I look forward to stopping in for another cup soon."}
{"text":"Tried this new place out as I was looking for a coffee shop to sit and read my book. The atmosphere was fantastic and open. The staff was very friendly. The only downfall was that the matcha was extremely overpowering and strong. The staff however was nice enough to allow me to exchange it for some loose lead green tea, which in fact was perfect!"}
