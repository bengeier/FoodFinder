{"text":"Pretty awesome Thai food. Can't say more than have the fresh and spring rolls and as much pad Thai as you can get your hands on!"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic! They are a very nice family. People like this deserve to do well. The location is tough, I know because my restaurant is close by. They really try and produce a great product."}
{"text":"We feel really lucky to live so near this place. The food is awesome and the service in the restaurant and for take out is exceptional.   We love the Pad Thai, all the chicken curries (especially the red and yellow), the spring rolls and cold rolls.  The deep fried bananas with honey are also awesome. Best to eat in the restaurant though for maximum crispiness and deliciousness!"}
{"text":"We love Thai food and when traveling, we always try and find a good Thai restaurant near our hotel. Sawasdee wasn't just good - it was amazing! Five stars for the delicious food, ambiance and great service. Even though we will only be back  in Toronto once a year - Sawasdee can count us as regulars."}
{"text":"I really like Sawasdee. It's a great little Thai place that is very quiet and peaceful great to bring kids to. For food I recommend for a big filling lunch/dinner  I recommend Coconut Rice, Spring Rolls and mildly spicy Thai style chicken wings. Their kebabs are also nice for a nice little lunch when you want good priced delicious non-spicy Thai. Decor: Cool artwork and plants give the place nice peaceful ambience while a woman who works there's cute little toddler runs around the back area of the restaurant. Not the best view but still not bad. Service is short and sweet  I give it 8.9 out of 10 worth coming back a few times"}
{"text":"This place is very nice! The food tastes just like in Thailand and the lunch set menu is very good value . In addition, the service is very friendly. Our favorite Thai restaurant in the area!"}
{"text":"Regularly eat here. Always nice service and food is prompt and delicious. Most often, I have the peanut curry, basil eggplant, duck, pad thai or #100 - a beautiful pasta dish with green vegetables."}
{"text":"I ordered their wonton soup off of foodora since im down with the flu and it was just what i needed. The wontons are AMAZING and so is the broth itself. If you arent a fan of mushrooms you cant even taste the  in the wontons. It just gives a type of umami flavour.  Will definetly be ordering from here again"}
{"text":"Service was really good .The patio was open and was well maintained .Perfect for people watching. Food however was below average.I ordered the eggplant basil.There was more carrot and bell peppers in there than eggplant.There was no basil flavor at all.There was no flavour.I had to ask for the hot sauce which by the way was not hot at all and tasked funky.Have had upset stomach all day.The food looked fresh but stay far far away from that hot sauce"}
{"text":"Great Thai food. When you say spicy, they make it spicy. We ordered the papaya salad, it was delicious and spicy. The service is also great, they listen to your order and are not in a hurry to run away. We also ordered the tofu green curry which was bursting with flavors, my husband ordered the cashew tofu dish which had oranges in it, I had never tried oranges that way, they were very pleasantly yummy!! I will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Liked the food and the service was great for take out on a Saturday night"}
{"text":"Personally I find it better than the bulk of Thai restaurants in Toronto, slightly more pricy during dinner time but definitley worth the money as you get tasty dishes with good quality meats and vegetables. We have only tried a few curries and the pad thai so far, but I really like the food - especially the pineapple curry is a favourite. The fact that they use chunks of fresh pineapple instead of canned pieces is a nice touch.Their Pad Thai is actually the most \"authentic\" and tasty one I've had in Toronto, definitely not spicy (as Pad Thai is traditionally not a spicy dish). Service is attentive and friendly, and it has become one of our go-to thai restaurants."}
{"text":"Ordered take out through Uber Eats it was the worst Khao Soi I've ever tasted. Super bland and the soup wasn't thick at all."}
{"text":"Really not impressed. I got delivery this week for myself and some friends-- the cnsensus was never again.  The guy taking the order was super nice and gave us free spring rolls. The food came quickly to my door, and was hot, but that was the best I could say about the whole experience.  The pad Thai was pretty good but everything else sucked. The green curry had frozen peas, corn and carrots in it and very little taste. The basil beef was not fully cooked and was completely tasteless. The sauce had been thickened with something like cornstarch too. Like canned gravy. And the Tom yum soup, well.... Tasteless, no veg, chewy shrimp. etc. You could make better at home with a spice paste package from the grocery store.  Sorry guys. You really need to do better."}
{"text":"This place is great - it's very clean, has a nice atmosphere, the people are really nice, and I love the food.  It's very consistent and reliable every time.  I would definitely recommend this place - I'm a regular.  Also, the fried banana for dessert is really good!"}
{"text":"Food was mediocre and bland. The service was horrendous. I was not served water at my table before or after receiving my meal. The server was not pleasant to deal with. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Nice decor and interior, reasonably clear service.   Overall, the price was average but portions were small so I'm not super happy. Also, things were heavy on the sugar. The pad thai was link candy.   The basil eggplant was reasonable, again small and lots of filler vegetables."}
{"text":"Really flavourful thai dishes in a nice atmosphere. We ordered Khao Soi, which was has a very deep curry flavour. Spicy Seafood was fresh indeed spicy but nothing too much heat. Basil eggplant was also yummy but I prefer more eggplant in the dish. Pad Thai was OK, but I have not found any pad thai in Toronto that I actually liked. The dishes all looked lovely and the restaurant was clean and pleasant. The service was friendly but could be more attentive (considering that at one point we were the only customer). We used a high chair for our toddler, and I appreciate that the chair was new and clean (many places have terrible high chairs). Bathroom was also clean, which is a really good sign that the restaurant is well managed. Dishes weren't too big so for three people, four dishes were enough. Price is reasonable. I would gladly return."}
{"text":"It's good but the portions are so small that if you order take away you need to get 2x each for 2 people. Tastes great - no complaints there - tastes just as good as any reliable Thai restaurant. Just you may want to consider a competitor with larger sized portions so you're not spending 2x the amount. That's all."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly service and reasonably priced. Got take out and really enjoyed the Thai green beef curry."}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight.  I lived in Thailand for 10 years; so I am not going to compare this food to authentic Thai food, rather I will just comment on whether the food was good or not.   Fried fish with mango salad was amazing    Spicy beef salad wasn't spicy at all, and the beef was served on a bed of cabbage which wasn't too great, though the beef and the sauce was alright.  It was a tiny portion of beef for the salad too. - wouldn't order it again   Red curry beef didn't taste like a Thai one at all and wasn't a good curry either. Would never order it again.   Had all of the above with sticky rice which was a touch on the sweet side, but actually quite nice.   I have had a beef pad see ew delivered to me before from this place , which was really good."}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant on the block- and I'm so glad it's here!  I've done take out and have had it delivered. Either way it's awesome.  The pad Thai is delicious- I recommend ordering spicy otherwise it's very mild (good for those Canadians who are afraid of heat), the red curry chicken is awesome..  Delivery is quick- about 45 minutes."}
{"text":"We wanted Thai food on a hot Sunday afternoon. This place was excellent prices and food was really good. Surprisingly it was open at 3pm for us to have a late lunch.   We got one free veggie roll for checking in on Yelp (just one)  Ordered the basil duck (a little salty but good). I would love to try the duck curry one day. Also got beef green curry. It was a perfect spicy (not too much but just enough kick). And the Peanut Pad Thai which was my favourite.   Deep fried banana with honey for dessert. Hot and fresh out the fryers. And Mango sticky rice. An excellent meal. ($60 for 3 ppl)  They also have some good valued set menus ($15 for 3 courses)."}
{"text":"Visited on Fri Dec 19 at 7pm party of 3. The place was empty, we were the only ones there. The phone seemed to be ringing for takeout/delivery orders. We ordered the appetizer platter which was quite good, good size for 2 people to share. We had the pad thai and glass noodles (pad won seen). The pad thai was quite good. The glass noodles are very small and delicate. Not much else to do in the area though. We parked in the Green P just North on the West side of Yonge."}
{"text":"Brand new resto in Yorkville.  Cool deco.   Cheap lunch specials - better than Na Siam a few blocks down. Lunch specials start from 8.95 including soup and spring roll.  I decided to stick with the tried and true Pad Thai as that's a good benchmark for Thai places.  Pad Thai wasn't spicy at all, but it had a good flavour. It wasn't spicy at all, but it's easy to make things spicier. I liked it because it was more authentic Thai than the ketchupy type that's served these days.  Hot and sour soup had great flavour and the spring roll was pretty good. Would visit again. More 3.5/5, then 4/5, but I'll round up since service was good."}
{"text":"I was staying around this area for the weekend and decided I wanted to eat Thai food. I came across this place and I'm extremely pleased. The food is fresh and it tastes amazing. I recommend the BBQ CHICKEN, SWEET AND SOUR CHICKEN, and GARLIC CHICKEN BROCCOLI with brown rice."}
{"text":"We ordered take out and the food was totally delicious.  They currently have a special if you order over $30 before taxes they include two spring rolls with your order. We decided on the green curry with shrimp, veggie tom kar coconut soup, and spicy beef salad. Everything was very tasty, flavourful, and not oily at all (YAY).  I would definitely order from here again, just wish they delivered to our area."}
{"text":"The food seemed like it was cooked on the spot. Very tasty. It's the only Thai place I've been to that does Peanut Sauce on top of the Pad Thai; which is to die for. I can't wait to go eat it again.  Edit: went back again, and I can for sure say that this is now my go-to spot for Thai Food. I plan on having it every week for when I'm downtown for sure.  No way I could get sick of it. I don't know her name but the woman working there is so kind and sweet, she makes everything worth going there."}
{"text":"More of a 3.5 star cause good customer service. I came in right when they were opening so at 11am for their lunch special. I was short on time and had to get back to work soon. Staff knew I was in a rush and they were quite fast. Served my dish in 10 minutes or so.   I ordered the Pad Thai for $6.99. Extras are $2.00 for 2 spring rolls or $2.00 for 1 spring roll and soup of the day (hot and sour for me when I went). However, if you check in then you get a free spring roll too!   I think the Pad Thai was just ok. I didn't think the portion was very big..bean sprouts took up 1/4 of the plate. I'm weird and don't like bean sprouts uncooked, so left that part alone. Lol. Also, taste was a bit on the bland side and they cut the noodles really short too. I did like their Thai ice tea tho, it's only $2-3 too.   So, while they didn't wow me...I'd prob go back if I was in the area and craving some Thai food. Food was OK and service was nice."}
{"text":"These shmucks ! I went in at 3pm and they had a lunch special . Ordered it and paid , have a seat and the food comes out all packed , the guy told me I couldn't sit here and eat because their lunch time is over and the restaurant was empty . Mother f*****s !"}
{"text":"Food was mediocre, for Thai food every dish we had the spices were off a bit. The Golden Pad Thai tasted like some kind of green curry. Maybe it's just a different 'style' but it's jarring and not tasty at all. The same can be said for our other items spices used were jarring for usual Thai."}
{"text":"great staff, very friendly. excellent pad thai, good spring rolls. doesn't appear to busy (can't b great for business). I would definitely recommend, very boring stretch of Yonge St but worth the walk."}
{"text":"3 for a super sweet, attentive lady. Good lunch price,.pad Thai was a bit sweet for my taste but my lunch date liked it. Cute decor! Worth a try but I didn't like the food ... No revisit"}
{"text":"A very underrated place. Food is excellent and service is friendly. Great combo with a thai massage upstairs at Urban Nirvana."}
{"text":"I was in the area with a colleague for work and our stomachs were telling us it was time for lunch. Sawasdee was steps from our destination and has good ratings on Yelp.  We ordered the Thai Green Curry with Beef and Chicken Pad Thai from their lunch specials menu for $7.99 each. We added on a soup and spring for roll an extra $2.00. Checking in on Yelp also got us a complimentary spring roll. Yay!  The Hot and Sour soup and Spring Roll were good and really hit the spot since we were hungry. Our entrees were also very good, nicely presented, cooked well, and flavourful. Good meal, good value."}
{"text":"I am Thai, and I can say that this place definitely serves authentic Thai food. Try their Curry Noodles (Kao Soy) or their Sweet and Sour Fish (Pla Sam Rod). The service was also great, and the atmosphere was also nice for a night out."}
{"text":"Ordered from Sawasdee through Uber Eats. Got pad thai, papaya salad, and Thai iced tea. The pad Thai wasn't too sweet and the papaya salad had a bit of spice to it. Everything tasted fresh and it was still hot when it arrived. Food came packed securely and they even wrapped my to go cup of iced tea with some saran wrap so it wouldn't spill (probably more for my driver than me, but I appreciated that they took the effort to make sure it was secure as possible).  I'd definitely order Thai food from here again and would recommend it to people that want some inexpensive but tasty delivery."}
{"text":"I went here for Thai food with some friends on a weeknight and we were the only ones in the restaurant all evening for dine in, even though the restaurant has plenty of tables. The menu has a great selection and includes all the staples in Thai cuisine. We got the chicken pad thai, mango salad, beef pad siew, jasmine rice, and seafood curry. Everything tasted really good. Prices were reasonable too. The location is slightly north of the busy Yonge and Bloor area so that could be why it's so quiet in the restaurant. But don't let that deter you away because they serve some great Thai food here!"}
{"text":"Great env. really good dishes! The dishes taste better than those of many Thai restaurants I've been to here in Toronto. I'd recommend any Thai food lovers to give it a try."}
{"text":"Our regular \"go to\" was closed, so after a quick Yelp search I found this place. The reviews were pretty good, so I decided to make the 15 minute trek to pick up an order of pad thai and spring rolls. They did not disappoint. The service was fantastic and the food, absolutely delicious. Perhaps the best spring rolls I have ever eaten. Perfectly crisp, fresh ingredients and the dipping sauce had just the right amount of zing. The pad thai was great, but next time I would ask for spicy. I will definitely be trying some other menu items in the near future."}
{"text":"Yeah this is a solid spot!  Their green curry was a bit too thin but the sticky rice was spot on and so were the pring rolls. I ordered ahead of time and picked up the order. It was seamless through out the entire process.  I definitely coming back here to try the rest of the menu.  You've got a fan in me!"}
{"text":"Enjoyable Thai food at reasonable prices. The menu has a really good variety of dishes and everything we had was delicious. The seating inside is pleasant and comfortable, and service is friendly and attentive. Patio is also nicely shaded by a large tree. There are plenty of vegetarian options as well as the traditional dishes. Short walk south from Rosedale station on Yonge or walk north from Bloor."}
{"text":"Great Thai food, customer service & always fresh! They also have a great lunch menu for reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Too lazy to cook tonight so I ordered the pad Thai for delivery through UberEATs. I'm not disappointed! Food was delivered fast and tasted fresh. I'd like to to check out the restaurant itself now for their other options."}
