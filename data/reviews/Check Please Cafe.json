{"text":"My daughter and I walked in and were seated right away. The server came by immediately and got our drink orders and we ordered our food quickly. It wasn't real busy but the food took a bit longer than I think it should have. Not \"This is bullshit, I want to talk to the manger\" slow, just \"Hmmm. I'm hungry\" slow. 

The food came and the portions were bigger than expected. The peppered bacon is amazing. Thick, not fatty, just perfect. All of the food was hot and on par with what I would expect. Nothing earth shattering but pretty good. 

The servers are attentive and checkout was a breeze. We'll be back. 

Two of us ate for $16.19 and left food on our plates because we were full."}
{"text":"I love this place!  We have dined there for breakfast on three separate occasions and each time they have not disappointed!  We always choose the \"check\" option and build our own platters.  I really like how you can add your veggies & garnish and there is no up-charge.   The peppered bacon is very good. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The Check Please Cafe is a breath of fresh air to our tiny town of Grafton.  The staff was welcoming and very friendly. The establishment was very clean and its decor has a homey country feel.  Their food is absolutely delicious and very responsibly priced.  Without question my favorite part of my dinning experience was their homemade ranch dressing.  It is one of the best dressings I have ever had!  I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"A wonderful cafe for breakfast. Everyone is polite and the food is great. We have been several times and all meals have been exactly as ordered. The restaurant is small so give them a call ahead if you have a large group."}
{"text":"First visit and while the outside appeared small and simple, the interior was clean and had an attractive dining area.  The menu, although a bit cumbersome on small clipboards, provided many options for personal taste.  The food arrived quickly and efficiently.  A great little place for breakfast."}
{"text":"The place is fantastic! Great service and fantastic mike shakes and good food. I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great tasting food.  Love the fresh cut French fries.  Service was outstanding.  The atmosphere is very relaxing.  A great add to Grafton!"}
{"text":"Great FOOD ! Fresh and tasty .  Service with a smile and great atmosphere. I would recommend !!"}
{"text":"This was a very pleasant surprise. The decor was rustic chic, a welcome change to the lorain county area. The concept of building your own breakfast or lunch sandwich was makes the selections even greater. The staff was prompt to greet you and friendly. They have a good selection of specialised coffees and their basic coffee is also very good. Their french fries are the good fair type fresh fries sitting a side of a huge sandwich."}
{"text":"Very nice, clean location with great food. Definitely a gem in the little village of Grafton."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  I really like how you can build your own breakfast and the choices are fantastic. The food is all locally sourced & organic meats which is a plus too.  As a party of four, we each opted for something different and none of us were disappointed.  The portion size of very generous and you won't leave hungry. Try the pesto on the side-  I added to my red skin potatoes and it was delicious.  I will definitely return to this place."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast. Great food quick. Spoke with owner for several minutes very friendly   Server was very efficient"}
{"text":"Adorable location, great food! Tried the cheddar potato soup and it was great. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Went there for Sunday breakfast. My Stuffed French Toast was luke warm. Our served acted like \"Oh Well\". We checked out and the cashier wasn't willing to compensate us for a not so great breakfast. It was our first time there. We were very disappointed. We wont be back."}
{"text":"Great food!  Lots of menu options and additional \"create your owns\" for breakfast, salads, and sandwiches. Service was prompt, the food is great and the server was a charming young lady."}
{"text":"If I could give this no stars I would.  Three people at our table of 8 got the Keto Skillet and it was awful.  The cook never drained the grease from the meat on any of our meals and it was so gross.  I ate it because I felt bad complaining and felt sick even after I drained the grease myself.   The waitress had a blank stare when I showed her the grease that was drained off my plate.  (In the pic it's the cup of brown liquid). The rest of the food was average.  The sour cream was like water and the menu said it had salsa which was really cut cherry tomatoes.  The butter also just didn't look right. After reading the reviews I had hopes for a great Mother's Day breakfast with my family.  Very disappointing!"}
