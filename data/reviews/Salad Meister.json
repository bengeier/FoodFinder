{"text":"This is the BEST SALAD I have EVER had in my entire life. Seriously. Tonight my husband and I ordered carry out from this place, and we were SOOO impressed. I got the Market Fresh and he got the Campus Cobb. The best part about this place is that they have the BEST ratio of dressing to greens to goodies of any place I have ever been to. We ordered extra dressing, but didn't have to use it. Both of us were as full after dinner as we would be if we order a steak dinner from Longhorn. For $20, you can't find a better summer dinner! THANK YOU!! May you stay in business forever!"}
{"text":"Wow great fresh salads or make a wrap out of it.   We ordered the Campus Cobb ($9.49) the Asian Zing ($9) and the market fresh ($9.49) all were delicious!   Attentive and friendly service too.  They had just opened an were out of avocado which was a bit disappointing but they recommended substitutes that were just as good.  Big portions!   You could probably split the wrap (they cut them in. Half) if you are not starving!  Highly Recommended"}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite place for s salad.  This months special wasn't very good at all...the main ingredient was white onions.  The salad was lacking the cheese,Zeenya chicken, corn and beans.  I suggest you build your own salad if you want to try this restaurant."}
{"text":"Absolute delight. Tried both salad & wraps...will def come back when in champaign. Veggies were fresh, dressing were tasty & at a reasonable price (9-11$)"}
{"text":"So excited that a healthy quick option is in Champaign, even if it's on campus. They label their ingredients with what is organic, local, vegan, and vegetarian. Every ingredient in my salad was fresh and perfect. The man who helped us was friendly and patient and so helpful! Everything was clean inside as well. For fresh, organic, local salad with a variety of toppings-- it's a great value!! For sure check it out."}
{"text":"It's a little pricey for a bowl of salad (about $10), but then again it's what you'd pay for a Panera salad, and they do give you a nice big salad. The ingredients are high quality and fresh, but what I really was impressed by were the dressings. They tasted fresh, and NOT the typical boring selection of ranch, italian, etc. Super yummy salad!"}
{"text":"I was very excited about this place opening, and so far I haven't been disappointed. The veggies are fresh and there's a great variety to choose from. 

When I've gone for lunch there has only been one person making the salads and one that stays at the register, and the line would get a little backed up so I hope that changes (I'm sure it will when the students are back)."}
{"text":"I love Salad Meister! I am thoroughly impressed every time I go (which is a lot!). All of the ingredients are fresh and taste delicious. The amount of options is overwhelming, so I usually just stick to one of the signature salads as opposed to creating my own. All of the signature salads/wraps that I have tried have been delicious and very filling. The service is almost always quick and friendly. I am always amazed at how much they can fit in a wrap without ripping the tortilla. 

While it might be a little too pricey for a student budget (sometimes $10+ for a salad), it is worth the extra buck or two, in my opinion. Salad Meister  is an awesome and healthy alternative to other Green Street fare."}
{"text":"It. Was. Amazing. I LOVED the coconut soup. Don't let the name fool you (it's not really coconutty) just flavorful amazingness with a bit of spice. The salad was tasty and pretty BIG portion. The goat cheese was delish! Price is about a dollar more than most places- however the quality is above average- I would most definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"I had really high hopes when I heard this spot was going to open and boy was excited when it lived up to the expectations! Seriously one of the best salads I have ever had. I got the Asian Zing and my girl got the Southern Spice. Both were phenomenal! I'm certainly going to make this a regular lunch or dinner spot. I especially like that they incorporate local produce into their line up which is really nice to see. The products are also organic which to me isn't the biggest deal but I know some people are very strict about that. The chicken was also really really good, it was legit chicken breast that was baked then sliced unlike most places where it's some sodium filled lunch meat. Both of the sales together came to around $18, which I think is a very fair price considering the quality and the quantity that you receive. It is a very large portion. The packaging they put the salads in, the utensils and the cups are all biodegradable also which is such an important move in my opinion. That alone made them one of my favorite restaurants already. In fact, I might be back for dinner just to try one of the other salads. When you're willing to go twice in one day, you know it's good!"}
{"text":"My husband kept telling me about this place. He's been there a few times since it's opened. I was skeptical at first, really how much can you do to a salad? I stand corrected. The food is clean and fresh. The flavors are bold and well blended. You can tell there was thought out into the menu. When I say fresh, I mean the avocado is not brown or mushy, the eggs are fresh and not been around for a day or two, the salad greens are crisp, etc...
On top of that, the staff are friendly and welcoming. Greeting you when you enter and thanking you and inviting you back when you leave. 
I will defiantly go back and try some of the other salads and wraps."}
{"text":"WOW!  Delicious, fresh, crisp veggies, delicious dressings.  The wraps are inspiring, the soups look amazing!  Everything We've tried so far has been better than I imagined it would be.  A great surprise!  We will order from here often!  Now I'm craving salad again!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Good salad. Too expensive if you need any kind of protein . I wish they had more premade options though."}
{"text":"This place has filled a huge gaping hole that existed for way too long on campus town. We needed a decent salad bar and oh does Salad Meister deliver. Fresh ingredients, great healthy options, personalizable to dietary restrictions, and oh so yummy! They're generous with their portions and have a great environment at the store. Everyone working there seems happy to be there and it reflects in their service. It makes me glad to\"bring my business\" here, i.e., stuff my face with a good salad. I've become a regular!"}
{"text":"Love this place! People are so friendly and the salad is so good!! Amazed by how fresh the food is. Favorite salad place on campus"}
{"text":"I was really excited for this type of restaurant to join the carousel of restaurants that come through Champaign. Their spin on being a sustainable and environmentally friendly business is certainly a nice touch, but the most important part of any restaurant is the food. For this town, it's good; if this restaurant was located elsewhere, I'm afraid it's days would be quite numbered. 

You select either a salad or a wrap, then choose either romaine, spinach, or mixed greens. Of course, you can combine them. There's a wide assortment of fresh fruits, vegetables, cheeses, and crunch items to add to your salad or wrap. Finally, there's proteins and dressings. 

I noticed the folks preparing the dishes often drained a lot of excess juice from the topping bins used on the dishes; they try their best, but the salad and wrap I've had from here were soggy as a result. They also do not have tortilla shells of a sufficient size for the amount of ingredients they use for their wraps. Of the wraps I've ordered, they fall apart and end up becoming a sloppy mess. 

Overall, Salad Meister is a good addition to the rather unhealthy, grease filled dining scene of the area. Would it thrive next to Chop't on the east coast? Definitely not. However, it is a good approach at being healthy and sustainable."}
{"text":"Amazing place! The tastiest salad I had in my entire life. In addition to usual chicken, egg, or bacon protein options they also have salmon and tuna.  I built my own salad with seared tuna, beats, goat cheese, grilled onions (turned out nice and crispy), wasabi dressing, etc. Big enough portion for two. When ordering via chownow.com  one could choose dressing on the side option to regulate the amount of dressing that goes into your salad."}
{"text":"In town for a conference at UI, we decided to try this place. Absolutely loved the food! They offer various salads plus a \"make your own\" option. The salads were fresh and the ingredients were tasty. Plenty of seating. We were very satisfied and we highly recommend this for good, fresh food!"}
{"text":"I like to eat and I don't always prioritize eating healthy. When I am hungry for lunch or dinner, I don't usually turn to salad as a first choice. Salad Meister could definitely change that. 

I've eaten at Salad Meister twice, and both salads were big and delicious. The ingredients were high quality and fresh. The blend of produce, protein, and dressing was well balanced and complementary. The salad comes with a piece of bread. The first time, the server remembered. The second time, she didn't, but I still felt satisfied at the end of the salad bowl. 

To order, belly up to the counter and choose between custom or signature and then salad bowl or wrap. Custom options include an ample variety of vegetables, cheeses, proteins, fruits, grain, beans, crunch, dressings. These aren't just your basics, either. For example, the proteins include everything from seared tuna (premium) to tofu to chicken. The cheeses can go blue, feta, cheddar, goat and more. You can add items to a signature salad, too, for an upcharge. Be sure to look for a board with the seasonal salad selection -- there have been some inspired combinations (roasted beets and goat cheese -- yum).

Of the signature salads, I can recommend both the Campus Cobb and the Chef. I can't recommend the others -- yet -- because I haven't tried them. I loved both of these salads. Loved. For those of us who find texture as important as taste, these salad blends with their range of components are a real treat.

There are only two drawbacks to Salad Meister. 1) Like most campustown restaurants, it gets packed at lunch. Even so, as long as you get there early, are willing to wait, or get your order to go, you'll be fine. 2) The signature salads are on the expensive side. I found them to be a good value, but I can imagine this would be pricey (at around $9 each) on a student budget."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh, and fast! Amazing quality for the price. My favorite place to get my salad tossed!"}
{"text":"Really good and fresh salads!  I've ended up coming here way, way more than expected.  The Asian Zing salad with double protein and dressing on the side is healthy and delicious.  With the extra protein it comes out to 11.99.  Given the lack of health food on campus, this place is a gem.  Also!  There's something for everyone!  If you want a salad smothered in ranch, cheese, and bacon bits, they've got that too!"}
{"text":"Whenever I feel like I want to eat out healthy for once on campus, I usually go to Salad Meister. Ordering is pretty simple, you just choose your ingredients like you would at Chipotle, or you can order a premade option off of the menu. I like their \"Hail Caesar\" salad, and I sometimes get a cup/bowl of soup, too.

On the other hand, this place is kinda expensive. I also wish they had more premade options, too."}
{"text":"Wish I tried this place earlier! I love having the option to either build my own salad or choose one of their creations! I was thoroughly impressed by how many options there were to choose from. I ended up getting the Asian Zing and it was sooo good! Ingredients were fresh, the chicken was delicious, and their dressing was amazing! The staff was also super nice and friendly. I asked an employee about the soups and he offered me a free sample since I wasn't sure which one I wanted! It was the real deal type sample too! He even added the jalapeno pepper and the green onions to it! I ended up getting the Coconut Thai Curry soup and it was also super delicious! Paid $14 for this entire meal and every dollar was worth it!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant. I love being able to order a salad with all the toppings that I want. They have so many choices. There aren't enough 'build your own salad' places out there. Plus, most places where you can build your own salad are buffets, and I always question the cleanliness of buffets. The food tastes very fresh. Free refills on drinks. I also love that everything at Salad Meister is recyclable--the bowls, cups, and utensils."}
{"text":"This is essentially a salad bar or like building a salad at subway...and the starting price for the salad is $9. It's a nice idea I guess if you are wanting to have a salad, but there are way better salads out there. I am not sure if I am paying for the \"organic\" food or perhaps so they can afford to pay their employees more than minimum wage (which was all over the signs in the \"restaurant\" but this is just not my kind of place. If you want salmon or tuna it's $2 more. Oh well...  the employees are friendly enough"}
{"text":"Love this place? The walnet and cranberry for the topping even make the taste a level up. Just wish they can come with the option for half size salad. It is huuugge!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. I am literally addicted. I've been looking in to eating healthier, so I decided to try Salad Meister and see what it's all about. The ordering process was very simple. The customer service is also very friendly! I usually build my own salad and add the fresh tuna sometimes. For being pre-made, the Tuna is not that bad! The order comes out to being around 12$, but you get a LOT of salad. I usually share with my significant other. The first time we went we got one salad each and had a lot left over for dinner!

The salad ingredients all taste very fresh. From the spinach to the bleu cheese and everything in between- everything is so clean and fresh! There are a ton of options for salad dressings, so it's always hard to pick. I am currently obsessed with the Chianti Basil though. 

I'm also happy that all of the packaging items are recyclable. 

This is a great place for taking out or eating in. I'm a big fan!"}
