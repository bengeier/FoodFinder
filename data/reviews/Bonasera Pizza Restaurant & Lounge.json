{"text":"Such a great casual homey place. Super friendly. Food is awesome and a groovy place to chill out and relax."}
{"text":"Seems nice enough for a little neighbourhood dive. But a pitcher of Kokanee gold will set you back $26... that's about $30 with tip for a little over three glasses (not full pints) of a relatively mediocre beer. Service was friendly but could only admit that it was a bad deal (especially when it turns out that you can buy beer by the glass for cheaper). Doesn't give you the impression that they know what they're doing."}
{"text":"Great dive bar with really good food! The pizza and lasagna are my favs."}
{"text":"The tried and true Bonasera! Awesome pizza and lasagna. And great wing nights, though I like the dry ribs more than the wings. This place has been around forever! It's a great neighbourhood pub with pool tables, TV's and food specials every day so there's always a decent food deal. They even do a mean steak, which is hard to find in little places like this. Don't expect a big range of beers on tap though! They only have 3 on tap, but they are served COLD and in a chilled glass. There's of bottled beer options in the cooler though. What more do you need??"}
{"text":"It's been 10 years since I have been in Bonasera and I recently came back because I am working two blocks away. Food here is awesome and the beer is cold. Don't really need more than that unless you like great pricing. Today (Friday), I had three pints of beer and a pepperoni pizza and it was $24.   You can't beat that so close to the downtown core. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place is a TOTAL HOLE IN THE WALL!!!!   But the service is amazing, the wings and meatballs are delicious and it's always busy with locals.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone who loves wing night!"}
