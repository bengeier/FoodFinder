{"text":"Onorio's Deli is probably one of the hardest lunch spots you could find in Toronto. It's located in the second basement of the Ontario Power Building and the only sign acknowledging its existence is by the staircase on the basement of the building.  It serves up sloppy goodness in the form of chicken/veal on a bun, top it up with mushrooms and hot sauce and you're in for a working lunch that's bound to require a fair share of napkins. But coming in at close to $7 it's not going to be a cheap one. And while shorter than a subway's footlong, it's certainly thicker (and yes I'm still talking about the sandwich here).  Besides the ____ on a bun, they serve up pizza's, salads and pasta (might have some others but that's what I've seen).  It's run by a family and Onorio himself who works the cash is blind and I admire them greatly for the amount of trust they put on us the customers to tell him what we got (if it's less busy he would already know your order) and everything to do with money handling as well.   Most patrons are people who work in the building and hospital staff, so not the first group of people one would expect to swindle money from a blind man   The food itself is probably of 3 star quality, but the friendlinest and the feeling of triumph when you figure out how to find this place pushes it in to the 4 star category for me, definitely a must visit if you're around this area and are not feeling typical food court chain fare."}
{"text":"It's a hidden gem. Literally. I kid you not.  I tried searching for this place for quite some time -- \"It's in OPG!? WHEREEE?!\"  Finally, a former coworker of mine showed me this place.  I was a happy girl.  Prosciutto sandwiches for $4.75? WELL, HELLS YEAH.  Can't complain.  Delicious? Yes.  Legit Italian mommies?  Even better."}
