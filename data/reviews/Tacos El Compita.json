{"text":"Hands down the most amazing carne asada burrito I've ever had! Their marinade or rub for the meat is.sooo good! When they ask you mild or hot ask for the green sauce. Both the red and green sauce are homemade both are delicious but the green sauce is absolutely amazing! Absolutely positively going back for more. I wish they were opened 24 hours!"}
{"text":"Just visited this place last weekend and if you read my review of Tacos El Compita #2 then you will know that this is THE BEST place for good ass hood style mexican food - taste so good make you wanna slap the bum at the chicken shack! The carne asada is the business here! No matter if you get it in a burrito, taco, or mulita, it's all good! Don't forget your Mexican Coke!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Vegas!!

I was introduced to Tacos El Compita #2 by a coworker and I have been addicted ever since. Mexican food is usually good if the spot is hood, and this place is no different. It's a hole in the wall but the food is tasty and cheap. They got the BEST carne asada, period. The Pastor is no slouch neither, real flavorful and saucy. I always get the 5 tacos for $5.25 and a Mexican Coke. They also got mulitas which are like open face tacos but they add cheese and another tortilla on top with avocado. You won't find that anywhere else around here.

I would probably eat here everyday if it was closer to my house. It's that good and I LOVE me some mexican food! Damn my mouth watering just thinkin bout it!"}
{"text":"So good!!! My new favorite taco stop!! Had the chicken tacos, the quality of the meat was excellent, flavor was perfect! Also tried the beef, it was very good, and not chewy either like a lot of other places can be. Excellent food!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for about 5 years.  I come here for the Carne Asada Tacos with everything (red sauce, chopped onions, cilantro).  They are street taco style meaning the meat is placed on two small corn tortillas. The Carne Asada (grilled steak) is traditional and flavorful.

They made this place bigger over a year ago so you can sit inside and eat. You order at the counter and pick it up from the counter when it's ready.  I recommend bringing cash even though they have a visa/credit card sign on the glass door.  It used to be hit or miss if it works so I just bring cash. 

I've been to other taco places in Las Vegas and as far as street tacos go, this is my second favorite and it's not as expensive as other high end taco places. The salsa bar is the same as you would find in different taco chains in Las Vegas except here it is very fresh and well kept.  I highly recommend it.  Oh yes, my kids had Chicken Quesadillas. They liked them and couldn't finish them all."}
{"text":"This place is the most legit Mexican spot in LV that I've found so far. Robertos does not come close. I've had most of the menu and usually go with the chicken or asada tacos and tortas - reminds of the authentic taco shops in frequented in California."}
{"text":"This place has a C from the health department! And you know what I don't give a fuck it's amazing! It's always busy the meat is fresh I love this spot!"}
{"text":"They must have changed cooks cause it's a whole lot better than it was before! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Better and more affordable then pepes. My dad found this place a while back and we have been going here ever sence. The people were friendly and patient. Never leave here hungry :)"}
{"text":"I love this place! I've only been here a few times but every time I've gone I've always had a good experience. Everyone's so nice and helpful and will answer any question you might have. Last time I was here I got the carne asada fries and they were delicious! Definitely a favorite of mine."}
{"text":"This is what I would consider authentic Mexican taco fare.  Excellent!  I really was sad when my meal was over.  It was so good.  

Paper plates, cash only, very good food.  

Tomorrow night we'll be finding another such place to eat.  Not because this wasn't great food, because it was.  Just because this place has got me hooked and I've got to try more."}
{"text":"Authentic good fast Mexican food. This is the only place I get my tacos, burrito, etc."}
{"text":"Authentic food. Good sized portions, very tasty! The temperature inside was really warm.  Almost enough to make me want to get the food to go. Fast service and a friendly staff plus low prices makes this place worth a second trip. ."}
{"text":"I love the tacos here! They are so amazing and taste authentic. There are a lot of authentic taco places around but this one takes the cake for me! I always go there in between classes at CSN just to keep me going through the day. They are addicting and I highly recommend their tacos! Great price for great quality!"}
{"text":"The food is top notch authentic Mexican street food, delicious and fairly priced. The red salsa was incredible. The atmosphere isn't glamorous, but it was clean. My wife and I were both very happy diners, we saw the great reviews on Yelp and were hoping they were accurate. They are. Definitely worth visiting."}
{"text":"I have been coming to tacos el compita for about 7 years, most of the time my husband runs into order our food. I absolutely LOVE this place. No other place has the flavor in there food like el compita. I've never had a problem coming here. They also always have peppers limes and sauce  out makes me happy, I don't have to ask for it. The decor needs work. But the food is so yummy."}
{"text":"You have to try the carne asada mulitas! They are the best. Hands down they have the best red and green sauces I've ever tasted."}
{"text":"If you know your Mexican street food and you want the best this is the place to go. Everything on their menu is beyond great. Always fresh and the caveza tacos have no competition. The best ever. Never had street tacos as good as El Compita's not to mention witch such generous portions of meet on them. Try them and you  will be hooked for ever."}
{"text":"Short: Good, but can be better. 

Long: Went here for lunch. Ordered three beef tacos. They're the typical three inch tacos with meat, salsa and sauce on top--at $1.25 each, it's quite the average deal. While everything was good, my main problem is that nothing blew me away and makes me beg to go back there. There taco trucks that are a lot better in the area, like 702Tacos down the road that blow me away. 

Go here if you want to eat good tacos inside and with a salsa bar. Otherwise, visit a taco truck--there's several in the area."}
{"text":"This place looks like every other little taco shop from the outside, but they're food is better than the others. There is only a few tables so sometimes it can be a little crazy during lunch, but worth it. My husband lived in Mexico as a kid and has craved the street tacos he had while living there. He has tried everywhere in town and could not find them until he tried Tacos el Compita #2.  Since finding this place it has become our favorite taco joint. And unlike Robertos, we don't leave feeling sick."}
{"text":"The hole in the hole in the wall taco shop, but I haven't had better authentic tacos, pozole, or menudo anywhere else! Come here for lunch, and you'll see what I mean!"}
{"text":"This place makes me want to learn Spanish!

We had chicken tacos, a beef burrito, and of course some horchata. The salsa bar was fresh and a perfect pairing with our foods. 

Lucky for us, this place is less than five minutes from our house!"}
{"text":"Este lugar es mi favorito cuando se trata de comer comida mexicana digamos en una manera rápida o fast food, todo es exelente, desde la comida salsas lugar y limpieza, si no pongo 5 estrellas es por alguna forma hacer notar la conducta, mal servicio y agresividad de la señorita que atiende x las mañanas, pues sin dar mucho de que hablar es super ridículo su agresividad con las personas y el mal servicio que da e incluso en la forma que se dirige a sus compañeros de trabajo. Espero y solo se me contacte x los dueños para poder dar más detalles."}
{"text":"We had the al pastor taco , tongue taco and carne asada quesadilla . The al pastor taco was very good, the best al pastor I've had yet.
        Carne  asada quesadilla  good grilled flavor and tender .    The tongue taco was very tender and moist but lacked flavor , maybe some seasoning would make it perfect, with the well stocked  condiment bar( salsas, jalapeño , diced onion and cilantro and lime ) making your food taste the way you want it is not a problem . 
       Like a previous yelper said they call out your order # in Spanish and I figured no problem ,I can count to 10 in Spanish and since the restaurant  just opened and we were customer dos no problemo, wrong your # is your receipt # and it's five digits so I can see the problem if you don't speak Spanish . Food is cheap and very good my kind of place."}
{"text":"My kind of mexican food! 

Fresh made chips to order and the salsa bar is fresh and plentiful.  Gucamole is more of a topping rather than fresh and chuncky but still good. 

We had the carnitas mulatos and they were awesome! The cheese is authentic and the carnitas meat was very tender and juicy. We also had the chicken tacos.. again tender and juicy! 

Tip: menu is a bit hard to read so use your yelp photos.. works great! 

Great meal for two with soft drunks for under 20 bucks.

We'll be back.. Thanks!!"}
{"text":"The burritos aren't 3.99 anymore (it's $6 and change) but it was good! I got the carnitas burrito. The tortilla was toasted to perfection (which I've never had it like that except for when you get a quesadilla) and the inside was very tasty. I also got to try to asada burrito which was given to me by accident. The meat was a but too salty. All in all, Id definitely go back again for the carnitas burrito!"}
{"text":"I was really craving Mexican, and after reading some of the other reviews concerning this hole in the wall restaurante I had to give it a try. Located right of the Summerlin Pkwy and Buffalo, this little place has a facade of no thrills but oh what a surprise you get. The menu is small but the food you receive is probably one of the best. The place has only a few tables and a bit of a funky smell, like it used to be a chinese take-out or something, but don't let that distract you. After ordering you notice that the service is extremely quick, like McDonald's quick, (I went on a Monday night around 8pm) and the little salsa bar with their different condiments is concise with pico de gallo, fresh cut wedges of limes, a green chile sauce, and a rich red chili sauce. I ordered the carne asada burrito and the five pack soft tacos with carnitas, carne asada, and lengua. All I decided to take them home to enjoy and what a surprise it was. Each and every one of the tacos were still soft and tender. The meats, no matter if it was the asada, carnitas, or lengua, had a slight roasted smoky flavor with a little kick. It didn't take me long to devour all the tacos. Next it was onto the carne asada burrito. All I can say is wow! Same great taste, smoky, juicy, and downright better than many of the other Mexican burrito joints in town. All I could do was nom, nom, nom! It was my first time trying Tacos El Compita numero dos, but it will not be my last!"}
{"text":"Can't beat their prices, and their food is amazing.
Their green salsa was delicious, and all of the condiments were fresh."}
{"text":"For me this is authentic Mexican fast food, but then I am a white girl from the Midwest. Every so often I get a craving for Tacos El Compita. My husband and I make the trek there and order so much food - several tacos, a quesadilla, a huge torta, etc. It is so good. And then I ultimately get sick a few hours after I eat. I swear I won't go there again until a month later when I get the craving again."}
{"text":"Great food. My son ate his torta so fast, it was gone before I knew it. My pozole had great taste and perfect temp. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"The Ricas Cemita is the best sandwich in Las Vegas. Tender carnitas, Oaxacan cheese, a roasted pepper on a hot sesame roll makes this my favorite Mexican restaurant. They also have good tacos al carbon and de carnitas. Skip the fountain drinks and go straight to the refrigerator by the door for Mexican cokes."}
{"text":"This is my first time visiting.
The chicken tacos were very good.
The service was very good as well.
The men's restroom, well that's another story.
I'm going to eat there again soon."}
{"text":"The carne asada here is probably the best in Vegas.  Tacos are only $1.20 each and the mulitas for $1.79 are a steal, with excellent cheese and fresh avocado with the meat of your choice.  Love the jalapeno/onion/peppers they have here and the horchata is excellent.  Tacos El Gordo still has the best spicy pork in town though..."}
{"text":"Never Fails! Every time I come here I get excellent service, they are friendly, fast, and I would come eat here everyday until I die lol! My office always orders big meals from here and when they say 20 minutes, they really mean 10min..food is made to perfection...there are no words to describe this place! This place is too legit!"}
{"text":"Coming from California you hope other states have Mexican food as good or better than Cali!  This place is legit!  Great food for a great price!"}
{"text":"Yay! What a good experience. In fact, so good I went back for seconds and am drafting this review while el cocinero prepara mis tacos. 

So I came in to judge a bean burrito. That's it. I figure if a taco shop can't make a decent bean burrito then why trust them with such intricate creations as tacos or tortas (or God forbid, a quesadilla).

It was good. Real good. And unique. A little smaller than a Berto's bean, and a little looser and with white cheese instead of yellow, but good. The salsa bar is good for a un-gourmet shop. The red and green salsas have tons more flavor than other places, and tons less bacteria aswell thanks to the refrigerated holder. Who would've thought, keeping ready to eat foods at decent temperatures. Shocking!

The pico is good, and FREE! A little too much onion and the few tomatoes weren't quite ripe enough, but I'm not complaining. Not bad. 

Then the tacos came. 1.25 each for choice of meat. I did the Asada and Carnitas, and I'd do it all again, dammit! Little TJ street style tacos with just the right amount of seasoning on the meat. I'm serious, try a bite before you salt it up. 

These went great with the accoutrements. Perfectly paired. 

So for around $5 I had a great, tasty lunch. I might come back for dinner. 

...and somewhere off in the sunset, in a dry and dusty land, a chain taco shop is crying because they just lost their best customer- except on $1 chicken taco Wednesdays, por supuesto..."}
{"text":"May I recommend Mulitas also known as #5. There is another location for this company on Tropicana and freeway 95south & also on Buffalo and Weftcliff. same menu also great flavor. This location is on the corner of Jones and Charleston and is next to other local owned businesses. A bit crowded at times but Mexican tacos shops are usually like this. Be prepared for some good salsas and don't be afraid of watch some Spanish tv while white eating some bomb ass tacos!"}
{"text":"I stopped here with a friend who was familiar with the place and raved about their carne asada burritos.  The dine-in area is very small, and the few tables were not wiped cleaned.  Since it was a nice day we ordered our food to go and ate at a picnic table at a nearby park.  

As a sort of appetizer, we ordered a couple of mulitas.  These are kind of like little tortilla sandwiches that have cheese, onion, avocado, salsa, and the meat of your choice.  We got ours with BBQ pork (pastor).  They were awesome and just $1.50 each.

I try to avoid beef as much as possible so I ordered the mole poblano with chicken, which at $7.99 is one of the most expensive items on the menu.  However, when I saw my friend's burrito, it did look appetizing.  So appetizing, in fact, that I had to try a bite. It had been two or three years since I had a carne asada burrito, but I can't say I've ever tasted a better one.

As for my main dish, the chicken was covered with the mole sauce, and rice and beans were served on the side, along with some slices of fresh avacado.  It had also been awhile since I'd had mole and I was not disappointed.  It hit the spot.  

I know I'll be back here on a pretty regular basis -- whenever I want authentic, delicious Mexican food at a very affordable price. 

It is cash only, so make sure you bring cash."}
{"text":"Growing up just outside of LA, I know good mexican food. This joint is solid, from the salsa, dollar tacos, to the killer burritos. You just gotta ask for cheese and avocado in yours!"}
{"text":"A great taqueria. My girlfriend and I were looking for authentic Mexican food for dinner and stumbled in. I order the chili verde and she got tacos. We were both impressed with the quality and flavor of the entrees. The guacamole is delicious as are the home made tortilla chips. The prices are fair and the staff kind and helpful. I highly recommend this restaurant as a go to neighborhood taqueria."}
{"text":"Love this place, reminds me of LA taco shops. I like that they have very broad selection of meats. I love that they always make the tripas crispy for me"}
{"text":"Kids and I just stopped by to grab a quick bite to eat.  The cooks and counter people are very friendly and courteous. Salsa bar was decent and the food served fast and flavorful. Enough seating here for quite a few people. Will definitely give this place another try."}
{"text":"I drove here last night granted it was New Year's Eve but the hours said they were open. They were not. So i figured. They'd be open today for sure. NOPE!! Not even a sign to tell us if holiday hours. 

Two others walked up trying to get in as well. 

Booooooooooooo"}
{"text":"my kids love the quesadillas here and we love the al pastor. the caldo de rez is also very good and hearty for when you are sick or in the mood for a good soup. kind of hole in the wall but prices are reasonable and food is amazing. can't ask for more."}
{"text":"Real delicious. Best mexican food ive had in vegas. I had pozale and it was very flavorful. Chunks of meat & very much reminded me of my moms. The tacos were good to & the place was packed."}
{"text":"People always tell you about \"their favorite Mexican food spot\" and good for them, but what most people don't realize is the best fast food Mexican food west of the Las Vegas strip is in fact Tacos El Compita. This place is clean, fresh and absolutely delicious. Best thing on the menu is their Mulitas, with many choices of meat you're bound to find the one for you, the price is simply amazing as well!! Only down fall is they close at 9pm, most of us like the burritos and tacos after midnight, so be sure to come here for lunch and enjoy the friendly staff as they prepare you some of the greatest Mexican Meals."}
{"text":"Great tacos. Had the pastor and the carnitas. The carnitas were a little fatty, but all In  All really good, pastor was excellent. Liked the flavor of the green salsa but I liked the heat of the red better."}
{"text":"Booooooooyyy. Anything off this menu is like 17 flame emojis. My top 2's are the Cemita de milanesa and the carne asafa burrito. Place is always packed. Shoutout their red sauce."}
{"text":"Religious murals, a candle-laden Catholic altar and arcade games coexisting in the dining room, and tacos. This place is... well, all over the place.

THE GOOD NEWS: they're no longer cash only and accept credit with a 50-cent processing fee. There's also an ATM in the dining room. There's a panaderia next door and a paleteria further down the strip center to continue your Mexicano dining adventure!

THE NOT-SO-GOOD NEWS: Apparently prices have gone up from most of the ones posted on these reviews. Tacos are $1.25-$1.50 each, my two-taco take-out order was basically $3. But when I opened the bag at home, there was a foil packet roughly the size of a slice of cheese. I wondered how they could have given me the wrong order, given that I was one of only two orders at the time.

THE REALITY: My two tacos were both mini-tacos, and the condiment container of grilled onions I'd grabbed at the salsa bar seemed to dwarf the actual tacos. I know street tacos are on corn tortillas and run a smidge smaller at traditional places than, say, Taco Bell or Del Taco, but these were absurdly small.
Similarly-priced tacos at Tacos Gil or the guys on Decatur are all easily twice the size of what I received here. Key words: similarly-priced. 

That being said, the lengua taco is fairly good and I liked the mild salsa verde, but the asada was lacking and overpowered by the ranchero-style sauce included when you ask for \"everything on it\". 

THE VERDICT: Disappointing. For tacos, anyway. Maybe I'll go Jade's route and try the soup next time.

Side note: also watch out for the guy in the parking lot with a bottle of Windex. He'll spray down your vehicle while you're inside, unprompted, then expect payment afterward."}
{"text":"I visted Tacos El Compita #2 afew months back and today I came in to check out their #1 shop. I must say I would prefer their #1(this shop) because it's more spacious. The other place was tiny and cramped. Just to add, both places had great service-- the workers were nice and friendly.

Despite my preference for spaciousness, the tacos at both places were crazy-good! Each taco was $1.05 and I ordered 4-- tongue (lengua), pulled pork (carnita), steak (carne asade), and marinated pork (pastor). All you need is to Squirt some lime for a hint of sourness and drizzle some extra smoked chipotle sauce on the tacos and it will be complete. All the tacos came out hot with generous amount of meat (see pics). The tongue was super soft, like butter in your mouth. The pulled pork and steak was my two least favorite-- not because it wasn't good, but bc if I had to chose and recommend, it will be the tongue and marinated pork. The marinated pork was super tender and tasty that if you look closely at the pork, you can actually see speck of spices!

Yummy in my tummy! Come here and get their lengua and pastor tacos at $1.05 each. Totally worth it!!!!"}
{"text":"Everything was excellent about this restaurant. The service was very friendly and helpful. We had a party of 15 and even though it's a small place they moved tables around so that we could all eat together. We ordered a variety of food and everything was delicious! Tacos, menudo, birria, torta, and burritos. We are definitely going to be back here whenever we're in town."}
{"text":"Pretty good food staff is nice. Could use a bit of janitorial work but other than that you can almost taste Mexico lol"}
{"text":"I honestly didn't know what a good taco was until I came here. I had the al pastor, lengua, and carnita taco and the al pastor is hands down my favorite! Quick service too, my food was ready within minutes of me ordering. Only downside is that they charge 50 cents if you pay with a card, so bring cash!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a place close to home that serves street tacos,  but not the taco wagon, which is great but we needed a sit down place.  I found this place on yelp,  so we checked it out.  We have been there twice now. The tacos plate is awesome and the employees are super nice. My husband had a burrito and this last time the quesadilla. He raved about how good it was. The horchata is very good also. 
We topped it off with dessert from the bakery next door. To die for!"}
{"text":"Had the tacos, mulitas, and the quesadillas. All had fresh meat (even though we came close to closing) Salsa bar was clean and had good selection. They have several locations covering 3 major Vegas seas. Will definitely be back when we are back in town!"}
{"text":"This is my second time here and I love it!!!  Whenever we come from California this is a MUST!  The pastor taco is pure bliss. This place is a wonderful hole in the wall. We fed a family of 4 for less than $25!"}
{"text":"The burritos and tacos are close to the food in California. The meat is juicy and has a good flavor, unlike pepes tacos where the asada is dry. Good food and fast service!"}
{"text":"I am so happy my best friend introduced me to this place. I get tired of eating the same old Roberto's and was looking for a tastier alternative. They seriously have the best carne asada here! I have been craving their tacos on a daily basis. The staff is very friendly and inviting. I look forward to trying other menu items. They are super fast, and this location is conveniently located off of Summerlin Pwy and Buffalo, easy to stop and get a to go order on my way home from work. Also, I have to mention I have never had any communication issues here, all the cashiers speak English well, and their prices are unbeatable."}
{"text":"No need to run to the border, you have home style Mexican food in Charleston. The funky colorful decor welcomes you to savor the flavors of your favorite town hangout. Tacos are Street Style so it's the small tortillas. The start of the show was the Sopas (Soups) like posole, and Caldo de res. And don't worry if you miss the game it's probably on at the shop"}
{"text":"Since we don't have King Taco in Vegas, this is the next best thing. A \"no-frills-hole-in-the-wall\" taco shop serving up mouth watering tacos to satisfy your craving for authentic Mexican food. You won't find mariachis, fancy plating or an overpriced pretentious menu here. In fact you'll get paper plates and food wrapped in foil just like they do in LA, street taco style. It's simply good food at a great price...as it should be. I know a lot of you are partial to Tacos El Gordo but I prefer Tacos El Compita. Can't beat their flavor & prices. Not to mention the staff is always very friendly and your food is made to order. 

A few of my favorites: carne asada fries and carnitas tacos with a Mexican coke. Comfort food at its best."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food that certainly has its flaws. Their food tastes good overall but they don't freshly cook their meats. Instead, all their meats are already cooked so you won't be getting the fresh tender Mexican meat that you want in your orders. If they changed that, this rating will easily see itself at the maximum of 5 stars. All the other contents of your standard Mexican burrito or taco is very well made and delicious. But it's more difficult to master such things as cilantro and onions. However, it's the meat that makes the difference. Oh and cash only. This is the digital age. El Compita needs to keep up with the digital emergence."}
{"text":"This place has good food, everything is made to order and I haven't had anything bad here. Mulitas are popular but I also have tried the cemitas and enchiladas de mole. All have been tasty. I like them better than Roberto's"}
{"text":"I've tried several items on the menu, Pozole, cemita, birria but my personal favorite is the Lengua burrito. This is the only place I eat it because they know how to prepare  the meat right. The food is amazing and as close as it gets to REAL Mexican Food. We've been coming here for years and the flavor hasn't change a bit. They used to be cash only but now they also take credit cards! I forgot my phone here and I thought I lost it, almost 2 weeks later we came back and they gave it to me. We are regulars and they knew we'd  come back."}
{"text":"Always delicious! We've had the burritos, these are huge and delicious! Tacos are great and the caldo de res is also yummy!"}
{"text":"Oh I was craving tacos! The thought of biting into a delicous taco with all the fixings had me drooling around yelp trying to find a place near me with grand tacos.  I found NOTHING through the search of \"tacos\" (which I indeed laughed at because as we all know its the first e.g of what to search for..) All I found was Robertos, and Lindo whatever. I was looking for something that would ease my craving for tacos, not just disappoint me with sorry excuses for tacos...

LUCKY I came across Misti's thread \"Taco Time\" http://www.yelp.com/topic/las-vegas-taco-time

Shes trying to find taco shops for a taco crawl....the first place I saw someone suggest was Tacos El Compita....so I threw it in the search bar and thought, \"Oooohh yes.\"

This place has some killer tacos. Every bite got me excited for the next. I'm a little sorry when it comes to spiciness so I stuck with the salsa it had on top, which was perfect for me. They, of course, have different salsas and all the other goodies at a bar.
I ordered the 5 tacos for $5.25. Two lenguas, two carnitas, and 1 pollo. Friggin BOMB. 

When that damn Mexican demon craving comes back, I'll know how to put it in its place.  Their tacos are delish. Can't wait to try more!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat tacos, mulitas, burritos! the food is amazing. the salsa delicious. worth the visit. the price compared to other taco places is way cheaper!"}
{"text":"Authentic Rural Mexican Restrooms

The food was excellent, and I would have given the restaurant five stars for that and for the clean kitchen which is part of the dining area.  However, a dirty and foul-smelling restroom detracted seriously.  Worse, sewer gas dominated the dining area.  The shame of it is that both of these problems are easy to avoid, the restroom by obvious means and the sewer gas problem by making a vent to the outside so the cooking ventilator does not cause undue low pressure in the facility.  OR the gas problem may be solved by simply making sure the floor drain gas traps are filled with water. 

It's a shame and maybe an unusual event.  We'll try it again."}
{"text":"I've found myself here more times than I care to admit, mostly because it's close to my work. That said, it's below-average Mexican food. The meats don't have much flavor, so get something covered in toppings like the nachos or super burritos. 

But if you are interested in the Chile Verde nachos other reviews rave about, don't bother. Maybe they've changed them over the years, but the order I got (and another recent review mentions) was lackluster, with minimal pork and very little cheese. The order was mostly soggy chips with a thick blanket of sour cream and fake guac. I can make better at home."}
{"text":"Good, cheap, authentic taqueria.  Defiantly a hole in the wall type of place and the folks who work there aren't overly friendly to non Spanish speakers, but tasty tacos for $1.43 a piece so can't really complain."}
{"text":"Just wanted to let everyone know that they punched a hole in the wall and now have a much bigger dinning area!

Same great food and prices!!!! 

Also they seem to have cleaned up their act a bit....... tables and rest room are much cleaner."}
{"text":"I had to try this place it out since it falls under my Category of Cherse = Mexican Food! Plus these Yelp reviews lured me in here in no time!!

Not the nicest place nor the biggest but I'm here for the food, besides this is what typical real authentic mexican food shops look like in Los Angeles, so I guess I'm used to it. 

Carne Asada Burrito with everything: Not the Best I've tried but definitely one of the better Asadas I've had here in Vegas. The meat had distinct roasted red pepper flavor, had a spicy note to it and was outright Tasty! Pour over some green sauce with squeezes of lemon juice and a couple bites from their sliced radish time to time, seemed to amplify the experience!!

Carne Asada and Carnitas \"Mulita\" Tacos: I don't know what \"Mulita\" means but it costs like 50 cents more and they add cheese (that real white mex. cheese), slice of avocado, pico de gallo.. Whatever, it's damn good!! They place a tortilla on top, forming a sandwich then they lightly fry the tortilla on both sides, just until it gets some crunch and the cheese starts melting.. The Carnitas (pork) was juicy, tender and flavor was on bullseye!

And the Blue Ribbon goes to the Carne Asada & Carnitas Mulita Tacos!!"}
{"text":"I have found my home for street tacos ($1.43+tax) and tortas ($6.69+tax) The meat here is simple and delicious. No frills, just \"con todo\" - which on a Torta is buttered bread,chopped iceberg lettuce, tomato, and avocado. I've tried so many places that this the best of the best when it comes to replacing LA street tacos, burritos, tortas, and mulitas. 

Grungy location in a run down Mexican plaza (behind Farm Basket)."}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican and it is close to my office.  I am in here enough that they know my order by heart: Pastor burrito, everything but rice, and habanero.

Food is great and consistently so. Their red salsa is not overly bitter like most Mexican restaurants and they can make your food with as much kick as you want.

Food portions are huge for the money and everything I have tasted is above average or excellent.

The decor is what it is and I've seen a few people ding them for it, but it isn't dirty as much as it is dated."}
{"text":"Such great authentic mexican food! Lots of variety. I would expect anything too great but its awesome comfort food for sure"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious.  Ordered the 5 tacos for $6.95 or something like that and they were amazing (two pork three steak).  There is a salsa and hot sauce bar for you to add everything you would like on your tacos.  The food was affordable and service was very very quick.  Must try this place!"}
{"text":"SOOOO GOOD!! We ordered the chicken enchilada plate. Husband devoured it within minutes. I got the small carne asada tacos, oh so very good! Our kids split a cheese quesadilla and they both loved it! The salsa bat had 4 or  5 different options, only 1 we didn't like. If you dine in you get a free basket of chips. They were super good and not greasy at all. The lady helping was super friendly and offered to keep our tab open so we didn't have to run out card more then once (they had a small fee to use card) totally worth the drive!"}
{"text":"This place has the most authentic Mexican food ive tried in Vegas since I moved out of my LA home base. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This is kind of funny how people from Las vgeas are just finding this place.  I live 1,800 miles away from Las Vegas but have been eating here since 2001.  Love their carnitas and everything else."}
{"text":"This is a nice little taco shop located on Westcliff and Buffalo serving up some great al pastor tacos and mulas. Al pastor and carne asada were my favorite and have a blast of flavor. We ordered some carne asada mulas which are like smaller quesadillas. Overall pretty good place to go get some street tacos for a good price!"}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp reviews. I've had what were easily the best tacos I've ever had. Delicious flavors and fresh meat. $1 each!!!

But what do I know about Mexican food; I'm a French-Canadian living in Central PA. Eh?"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food near summerlin (westcliff&buffalo NW corner) I had the mole combo and the chile verde combo.  Great prices and big portions! Can't beat that on this side of town!"}
{"text":"I don't ever write reviews but this place definitely deserves it. My boyfriend and I each got the 5 taco plate with a variety of meats...needless to say, it was absolutely amazing!! The tacos are loaded with meat, and topped with onions, cilantro and hot sauce. You definitely get more than what you pay for."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Mexican food in Vegas everything I've had so far is amazing love tacos burritos you name it but since there the best always alil busy"}
{"text":"Thank goodness for fellow yelpers that give recommendations in comment boxes. I was reading reviews for a different Mexican joint (as I've been on a search for authentic food) and was about to settle on going to that place when I saw someone say that this place had the best tacos in Vegas and was extremely authentic. So my fiance and I went there and were given slightly quizzical looks (as we were the only asians in the restaurant) but nonetheless the cashier was friendly and the place smelled sooo good. 

We had planned on only getting tacos but after looking at the menu and smelling the goodness coming from the kitchen, we decided to also order a combo burrito and pork with verde sauce. Everything was good, even the rice and beans. The only complaint is that the pork w/green sauce was really fatty which is typical of authentic Mexican spots so I picked the fat out. We are so happy to have found this hidden gem!!"}
{"text":"Very good food asada and carnitas
Burritos tacos mulitas los Angeles style
Food hot sauces good red and green"}
{"text":"Food is very delicious, their tacos and carne Asada quesadilla were really good! The staff is very friendly. It's good for a quick bite"}
{"text":"I had bookmarked this place to try quite awhile ago but didn't get around to trying it until a couple of days ago. I ordered three carne asada tacos. When the guy told me the price of less than 4 bucks I thought to myself that I should have ordered another one. I was right. The tacos were small (i.e., think three-bite taco) but tasty. I was disappointed when I first saw them because they had a red sauce on them and I'm a green salsa type of girl. However, the sauce had a nice smoky flavor. Not my favorite tacos ever, but I think I'll give them another try.

They had a salsa bar with red and green salsa, pico de gallo, radishes, onion, lime, and pickled carrots. I got some of everything. However, I didn't end up eating the salsas because the tacos were already very flavorful. I only got like one piece of carrot because the container was about empty. I don't think the guy at the counter spoke a ton of English because when I told him the carrots were about empty he just smiled and nodded."}
{"text":"Really Great tacos!! 
Awesome salsa bar and Refreshments from Jamaica to Tamarindo!

Great spot Very Good
I'll be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is one of our favorites for lunch. Don't be mistaken into thinking it's the cheapest place, but the food is excellent and we'll worth it! You can't go wrong with their taco plate with carne asada or pastor. Overall a great hole-in-the-wall find that exemplifies what I love about Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Update: Mulitas still very good, but why no Pico de Gallo available? I would be happy to pay for it if it is too expensive to offer for free. The maintenance not as good as before--bathroom messy and covered in graffiti."}
{"text":"This place is truly authentic mexican food. The place could use an upgrade especially in the restrooms, but food is amazing. They only take cash, but have an ATM available inside. Great service as well."}
{"text":"I'm honestly surprised at how much I like this place. Tacos el Compita has surpassed my expectations in every way. From the outside, it doesn't look like much. It's right behind a car shop amongst other businesses that seemed out of place. Going in, it doesn't look like much either. The walls are adorned with figures and paintings of Catholicism and Mexican culture. The furniture, the walls, and the floor shows signs of aging. Overall, the place doesn't look like much.

The food shines through all of this. It is amazing. I've always been a huge taco fan and this is my go to taco spot. In my opinion, Tacos el Compita is better than Tacos el Gordo any day. There is usually no line to order, minimal wait time, and the price is such a bargain! They have a five taco plate for less than $8! My go to tacos are the lengua and tripa. The carnitas are pretty damn good too.

Overall, fantastic food for a bargain! I highly recommend for taco lovers!"}
{"text":"ohhhh myyyyy gawwwwd. These tacos are fire. They are perfect if you're near CSN or very hungover and need to soak up some booze with delicious carne asada. It's a very authentic hole in the wall type place that will not leave you disappointed."}
{"text":"i live in california every time i got to vegas i have to go to tacos el compita #1 there menudo  and birria  de res and chivo is boom there customer service is great"}
{"text":"Never disappoints !!!! Everything is delicious here if anyone else says otherwise they don't know the true meaning of Mexican authentic food!"}
{"text":"Not gonna lie, this place looked sketchy as heck from the outside and inside, but sometimes the dingiest hole in the walls offer up the best food and my fiancé and I were feeling adventurous enough to chance it. 

To our surprise, they offered up tasty and flavorful authentic Mexican cuisine. I also learned that they're actually a small chain: with 3 locations in Vegas (Charleston, Tropicana and this location on Westcliff) and there is also a location in Los Angeles that's poppin off popular sharing most of the same menu offerings.

Here's what we tried: 

* al pastor tacos - street style, mini soft taco, very flavorful, moist meat. 5/5

* carne asada tacos - street style, mini soft taco, great asada and charred flavor, but meat is a tad on the dry, chewy end. 3/5

* al pastor mulitas - it's like a mini quesadilla! Super cheesy with moist al pastor meat and a little bit of avocado sauce. I was shocked by how much flavor was stuffed in that little guy! 5/5

* mole chicken enchiladas - holy mole-y it was delicious! The mole sauce was very thick, slightly sweet and flavorful. Plus the shredded chicken inside was moist. The enchiladas came with a tiny side of rice and beans which were both average. I enjoyed the mole sauce and loved the savory sweet combination of flavor, but to some, they may find it too sweet. 5/5

* chile verde nachos - The chips are fried fresh and super crispy - my favorite part of this dish. The nachos are topped with moist and flavorful pork, guacamole, sour cream, pickled serranos, beans and lots of malty cheese. It's a serious meal in itself! 4/5

* salsa bar - all of your usual suspects: red hot sauce, salsa verde, pico de gallo, pickled jalapeños, lime, pickled oregano onions. My favorites were the salsa verde, pickled jalapeños and pickled onions. Unfortunately, nothing was very spicy. 3/5

Do not pass on the the horchata! They have the most delicious horchata I've tried yet! Bold flavor and not watered down like every other place. I see myself cruising by just for a cold, refreshing horchata since they are 5 min from home. This could be dangerous! 5/5

As you guessed, this place is cheap! My fiancé and I left stuffed with lots of leftovers for about $24 and change."}
{"text":"Over rated for sure ! Older man taking orders is kinda cold ! Not friendly at all ....the tacos were ok, had to pick out a lot of fat in all my tacos , and the meat was not seasoned that well. Was expecting better quality and taste with all the good reviews...  plenty of taquerias in the valley that are way better then this place ... won't be coming back !"}
{"text":"Hands down best tacos in Vegas. I'm from cali and didn't think anyone could compare to LA tacos trucks... these people are. I got 4 carne asada tacos and a carne asada burrito. I absolutely loved the tacos... the burrito was good but not as amazing as the tacos."}
{"text":"Why travel to Mexico when you have Mexico right here. Authentic bomb Mexican food, need I say more."}
{"text":"My husband loves this place.Their food is delicious and very affordable. Whenever we get a craving for Mexican food we come here :-)"}
{"text":"Definitely worthy of five stars. So flavorful, very reasonably priced and fast service. We got the 5 mini taco plate and quickly devoured them. So good, the carnitas were just dripping with flavor. The chicken tacos were the good chicken, not the processed strip things some places have. We ended up ordering 5 more tacos and bringing a few home for family, that's how good they are. Go check them out!"}
{"text":"Tacos are extremely good here! It is a small place with Mexican authentic decorations. All the food seems to be fresh made which is even better! Tacos are good priced only $1.50. Definitely recommend this place for their tacos."}
{"text":"The food here is very delicious. I enjoy coming here with the family. They are a little high on the prices but definitely worth it. They have a shared parking lot and they do take debit and credit. I wish the owner would invest a little on this place. It's in desperate need of remodeling. More seating would also be a plus ."}
{"text":"Love there  Their food  I'm a Cali guy And it's hard to find good menudo  in Vegas. I've been coming here for a long time."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. Across from the community college. Tacos are extremely tasty and very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Hidden behind a gas station in a run down strip mall, Tacos El Compita #2 does not make a strong first impression.  The restaurant itself feels a little run down with a very cramped space and a tiny amount of tables, which appear to only occasionally be wiped down.

Given all of that, Tacos El Compita #2 requires a leap of faith.  But give the place a chance and you will experience the best carne asada burrito in Las Vegas.  Yes.  The BEST.  Now, I don't give that title out lightly.  There are some good Latin places around this Valley, but this taqueria's cooking out does them all.

Why?  The secret is how the place cooks the meat for the burrito.  Rather than tossing the steak on a grill as orders come in, Tacos El Compita #2 keeps the steak mixed into a spicy soup.  Kept on a separate stove just below simmering, the steak has been stewing in a delicious, spicy tomato-based soup.  And when the sauce is drained off and the carne asada is placed alongside the rice, beans and cheese, it's over-the-top delicious and spicy and flavorful.  You will have to remind yourself that you're in a taqueria after you start eating because you just don't expect this level of flavor from a small hole in the wall.

Since I moved to Henderson, this place is about 40 minutes away from me.  But it doesn't matter.  We make the drive.  It's just that good."}
{"text":"Legit mexican!   Seriously, I love Robertos, but this has something on Robertos, its the same , but better.  I cant put my finger on it, but I know its better, lets think here.....cheap as dirt, quick, flavorful, fresh made to order, glazed meats, mexican workers, bare bones, simple and it makes sense all together.  So simple it is , but remember simple can be supercalafragelistickexpeealodocious.....super for short.   No \"undalay\" over there for a burrito filler!   Satisfied always!  5star mexican!"}
{"text":"I feel compelled to give ppl the yellow light on the chili verde nachos. I searched yelp for nachos because I was in the mood, and it led me to this place and a bunch of rave reviews for the CV nachos. 

I have no horror story. I just want to say they're not worth it and you'd literally have to pay me to eat them again. 

They looked kinda small when I first saw them, but, when I started eating, it was clear that three ppl could happily split this as an appetizer. 

The word that pops in my head when I attempt to describe the flavor is \"tangy\". I asked for light sour cream and, as the picture shows,  they didn't over do it. But all I remember flavor-wise is tanginess. There were small bits of pork in it (so small). This costs 8.46 tax included, and the other reviews kinda make it clear that you can get a lotta meat at this shop for $8 by other methods (tacos, burrito, plate, etc.). This is highway robbery compared  amount of meat you get on a $6 order of nachos at any other hole in the wall or fast food joint. Speaking of fries, these nachos have potato? in them. I should have taken a picture but I was so underwhelmed by the dish that I had no desire to. Small (but significantly larger than the pork bits), soft chunks of potato throughout the nachos. They weren't bad, but I just didn't understand why there were potatoes in my nachos. 

So yeah, if you come here, and want to try the chili verde nachos, maybe split it with two friends. Maybe, I'm the strange person and everybody else loves it, but, after eating them, I don't get it. Also another review mentioned spice. I'm not spice blind. I can handle very spicy food but I also appreciate the lil kick I get from a packet of fast food hot sauce. I remember no heat in this dish. It was just a whole plate of Why. Just my body asking why I was doing this. It didn't taste good, wasn't good for me, just eating it, trying to figure out why ppl liked it."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this restaurant after reading the reviews on Yelp. We were both raised in SoCal and wanted to try the carne asada. On our first visit we tried a carne asada burrito and had some el pastor and the carnitas tacos. We were surprised that the carne asada burrito was not as good as everyone said. It's not bad but it's just not as good everyone said. The el pastor and the carnitas tacos we had however were fabulous!! 

We went back again today and tried the El Pastor tortas and some more carnitas tacos. Both were unbelievably good! The tortas was the best I've ever had. The food tastes so fresh. The green sauce and condiments are very good. 

Finally, the couple that run the place work their butts off and are extremely friendly. 

As good as this place is I am surprised it is not busier. You should go and change that."}
{"text":"Not only is this some of the best Mexican food I've had in Vegas (it reminds me of a few spots back home in So Cal), but it's even walking distance from my house. Totally worth the price!"}
{"text":"$1.25 for tacos! Authentic, cheap, and crowded! I might try the seafood soup next time. This will be my go-to down home authentic Mexican spot moving forward."}
{"text":"I came into this lil place a few months ago for lunch since it's a few minutes away from my work place. It's a small hole in the wall place, but the food is delicious! The beans were homemade and you can taste it! I recommend this place for typical Mexican food, being Mexican this food reminds me of my moms' cooking and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Really good authentic tasting carne burritos but sometimes there is WAY TOO MANY onions!"}
{"text":"Love this place,  hole in the wall restaurant with delicious food. I have yet to be disappointed with their food. On Fridays only, they have Fish Tacos, yum yum.. Prices are super cheap, good quality, burritos are huge..."}
{"text":"I came here expecting the worst. I order 7 carne Asada tacos. Almost 10$ for it. It was surprisingly good this is what Mexican food is all about, cheap and good. This place is not pretentious like other Mexican restaurant here that try to scam white people into paying 5$ for one taco and 10 dollar margaritas."}
{"text":"4.5 stars

FINALLY!!!!   I've found real Mexican food in Las Vegas!  I've been searching for over 4 years.  It's been an emotional roller coaster of getting my hopes up only to be disappointed time and time again.  Growing up in Southern California I guess I have high standards.  But no more let downs, my search is ended.

This place is no joke.  It's as good if not better than many of the taco trucks I've eaten at in L.A.

They serve the best, most perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned tripas.  

The buche was awesome - tender and juicy.  

Carnitas - not tex mex crap - this is the real deal.  Like southern pulled pork.

Cabeza was great, the carne asada solid, the al pastor was up there.

I've had better tortillas but I'm not complaining - these worked.

The food was so delicioso it actually brought a little tear to my eye.  

And talk about cheap eats.  Tacos are like a buck each.  Be sure not to order more than 2 or 3 tacos per person at a time - they're best served hot off the grill.  You can always go back to the counter and order again, and again, and again....

And be sure to throw a five spot in their tip jar, they deserve it.

{"text":"Ay Dios mio!  This place is good!!!

This is the second outlet of the original Tacos El Compita on Charleston and Jones  (http://www.yelp.com/biz/tacos-el-compita-las-vegas)

The food is just as authentic and good as the original.  It is much smaller then the original with less seats so if you go during lunch or dinner rush you may have to wait for a seat.  That contributed to the half-star deduction as well as the fact they do not have aguas frescas or fresh jalapenos both of which they have at the original location.

I think the tripas are my fav here.  But everything else is so good - the carnitas, buche, lengua are all excellent.

I want to try the caldos here, someone next to us had some menudo that looked really good.  

I tried the cemitas and am not a huge fan because I didn't love the bread.  and unfortunately I believe it's the same bread for the tortas, but I'll have to try next time."}
{"text":"The asada tacos here are BOMB.  Nice little hole in the wall right by a self-serve car wash.  Tacos are $1.60 +tax, and there's a $0.50 charge if you use a credit/debit card.  The tortilla here tastes so good, it's not oily.  The asada was chopped into very small pieces and was very tasty.  My girlfriend and I ordered them with \"everything\" on it which includes hot sauce and some onions.

They have onions, sauce, radishes, lemon/lime, peppers and seasoned onions available at the self-serve condiments bar.  Let me tell you, the seasoned onions are so good, but be prepared for a full day of onion breath (worth)!  Bags are available for you to take them to go as well.  

Aside from the food there's plenty of seating available and a few TV's to watch.  Parking is plentiful but could be difficult to find if you're trying to park in front of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Ive eaten here twice and each time amazing!!  The first time was Pozole with my friends from work.  So much great food and  good price!  

This time it was Birria and it was great!  All of the flavor of home!  Not joking!"}
{"text":"Now when ever I get that craving for some real tacos... there is a place to go.  This place makes the best tacos I've had in vegas...  The tacos are just as good as the tacos from the taco trucks in L.A.

The only drawback to this place is that they don't open late ( sign in the window showed they close at 8pm) and it's cash only.

So if you're going to go ( and I highly recommend it), don't go late and hit the ATM before you go..."}
{"text":"A hole in the wall and some might not be comfortable with the crowd, but once you get over it, the food is sooooo worth it! If I remember correctly, the tacos are $1.38 each and you can choose from all kinds of meat including beef tongue. My favorite taco there is probably just beef. Also the tacos may look small, but they fill you up quickly. Even though I can wolf down steaks at buffets, 5-6 tacos is probably my limit here.

They also have a condiment bar and you can get grilled onions and peppers for free if you ask for them when you placed your order."}
{"text":"I've only been here once, so maybe I just came on an off day, or just got the \"wrong\" thing, but I won't be back. It wasn't good enough to justify driving even the short distance from my house (1 mile.) 

I tried Carnitas Burrito with beans and rice, and was not at all impressed. This is sad mexican food, bland and flavorless, but at least cheap. Rice and Beans were average. Horchata was good, but really, it takes special effort to screw up Horchata."}
{"text":"The Al Pastor tacos are incredible. The service is always great and the food is always delicious! Every time I go in there, they are nice and greet me! The prices are perfect."}
{"text":"Quesa, carne burrito, pollo asado torts, very good. Excellent sides for free also. The place is clean, not really visible from the street, go behind the car wash/ gas station. Looks and tastes authentic. Limes and jalepenos are a great compliment."}
{"text":"I almost pass the opportunity to a delicious lunch at this place because the restaurant did not look to extravagant from the outside. My wife and I appreciate tripas taco from time to time and they serve them and the place is very near my home. We came to find out that the place has way more to offer. The food is delicious and a great find. Tripas tacos almost lifted my body off the ground and the carne asada nachos hit the spot. Because it has been so long, and we almost gave up on vegas to deliver great mexican restaurant. Considering we have somewhat high expectations coming from Seaside, Ca before we became Nevadans. Staff are very friendly and welcoming. Check-out this place and it will lift your spirit too."}
{"text":"This is where the Mexicans come to eat. Hands down the best tacos and tortas in Las Vegas. Im not a big man but when I come here I eat like one. Everytime I come here I eat four tacos 2 Chicken 2 Carne and a torta, the best in town. absolutely love this place"}
{"text":"You need only one reason to come here: chili verde nachos.  The chili verde is too good.  It has my boyfriend and I driving 20 minutes there and back just for it. The tacos are good too from what I've tried.  The menu is kind of hard to follow at first and cluttered with tons of photos.  Probably why we stuck with what we knew in the beginning; but then we branched off to the \"special items\" listed next to the register.  Chili verde nachos is where it's at.  I crave these things constantly.  Melt in your mouth good... just beware of the hidden jalapenos in there if you are sensitive to spicy."}
{"text":"Taco, taco, taccco ! TACO !! Had the tacos (could you tell?) They were mighty fine! Lengua and pastor were the yummier ones. Mulitas were also ordered but very forgettable. My Guatemalan co-worker recommend this place but for the tortas, so I guess that's next on the menu. They also had a good handful of soups which is nice for a taco joint. 

P.S. I got take out, the neighborhood seemed a bit sketch and the place is located behind a car wash... Totally up to you. Overall I give this place 5/5 Pedros."}
{"text":"The best burritos in vegas love this place. Mulitas, menudo well everything on the menu is so delicious everyone that works here are very nice"}
{"text":"We came here twice while in Vegas.  I wasn't feeling well so I asked for the caldo de res very good and hearty.  My husband asked for tacos, they have sides of chili my favorite the green chili.  I ordered the small plate and it was topped to the max, plenty of veggies and meat just delicious.  This place gets packed even though they have plenty of seating.  It's not a fancy place very homey you can tell many of the locals come here.  On our second visit my husband asked for the menudo which seems to be a local favorite.  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I love this place.  It's so close to my job I go more than I should but I'm not complaining. I love the Carne asada mulitas.  The tacos. The chips. The staff. The Pico de gallo. The green salsa. I love it all. I wish I could afford to eat the calories everyday."}
{"text":"great food, amazing prices. dont understand the talk on previous reviews about a seedy strip mall. i've been to much worse and it's not the least bit dangerous. last night had 7 taco's, cheese quesodilla and carne asada quesodilla, total bill $16.47!!!! the food is absolutely delicious. staff is nice and helpful. the horchada is awesome as well."}
{"text":"Nothing says authentic Mexican cuisine like uneven tiling, soccer on TV (español of course), and down-to-earth prices. Got menu item #1 which was 5 street tacos, meat of your choice (mine was pastor aka BBQ pork), it was amazing and only $7.25. Hot sauce was pretty hot, the place was very clean, and although it's not pretty inside at all it felt cozy."}
{"text":"With all the recent Yelp talk about a taco crawl, I was craving tacos more than usual. So I decided to hit up El Compita during my lunch break. I didn't have a lot of time so I had to grab and go. It was crowded during lunch and I was the only non-latino/hispanic person in there. That's always a good sign that the place is \"authentic\" and good. I was too intimidated to order in my broken Spanish, so I just ordered in English and the guy behind the counter smiled. It was probably the only English he heard all morning.

I got an order of 4 tacos (2 carnitas, 1 asada, 1 pastor). Each taco was $1.05. Despite the crowd my order was up in about 10 minutes and the guy behind the counter was nice enough to tell me in English that my order was ready. Everything was good, but I still have to rank Los Parados and La Mexicana ahead of this place. The carnitas here are good, but the asada just doesn't come close to what you can get at the other two places. The pastor was decent, but my least favorite of what I tried. It just wasn't as tender as other places. But, it did have a lot of heat -- at least for me. I can't handle really spicy foods, so while it was spicy to me it's probably mild to most people. Ten minutes after I was done eating I could still feel the heat on my tongue. I had to wash it down with a few glasses of water.

There was a guy selling CD's and movies from one of the tables. He had a huge box full. It may have been the same guy that Lisa mentioned in her review, but the guy was quiet and low-key about pitching his stuff. 

3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Best tacos ever!!! Well worth the drive is the strip. This is a hidden gem for sure! Carne Asade was grilled to perfection and the salsa had the right about of heat! Definitely coming back again on my next Vegas trip!"}
{"text":"4 stars if the place was in Indiana or something, but not with a bunch of excellent competing mexican places in the area.  The tacos were fine but not spectacular. The carne asada was the best out of what I had (carnitas, buche, pastor, and lengua)."}
{"text":"Had chilaquiles verdes. Very very tasty and well presented and prepared. When i walked it the smell was fantastic"}
{"text":"Every time I feel like having a Burrito before church, I always stop here. The food is good and affordable. The place is not the fanciest, however, if you could look past that you will have a good meal."}
{"text":"It will surprise you how good the food is here. It's just the outside that will put you off a bit.  The inside feels like you are in an an authentic Mexican dive.  It is a good sign that people who are in the know about what good Mexican food is like seem like they are regulars here. You might become one, too. I know I want to return for the tasty tacos, and delicious soups!"}
{"text":"Location: West side

yuh yeah.

Taco El Compita is like Mexican spots in LA, offsetting appearance, shady business plaza, and smells like chlorine when you enter. Its going to take some guts to jump in and give it a try if you're used to spots like Baja Fresh or Qdoba. Once you're in though, YOU'RE IN... assuming that you like more authentic Mexican food and have no intentions of ordering carne asada fries. 

From my experience with the carnitas, carne asada , and pollo they are a bit spicy and kind of have a tomato taste. The tacos are tiny, but they are soft, have intense flavor, and only cost 12 pesos (1 USD)! The burrito however is not tiny, you could probably fit a Taco Bell grilled stuffed burrito in it. Anyways my carne asada burrito was filled with rice, beans, onions and well carne asada, none of that sour cream and guacamole nonsense. 

The salsa bar is pretty small, but definitely has all the essentials, pico di gallo, lime wedges, green salsa, and red salsa. Service was quick and prompt.

If it adds to anything I always see Hispanic customers here, so maybe they think its legit too. 

SMALL SMALL SMALL thing that bothers me though is that the menu board facing the cooks and not where the customers are facing."}
{"text":"Best whole in the wall taco spot in area . Malitas r a must! Mulitas is like a taco quesadilla hybrid"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food. The tacos are reasonably priced, and very good. They have a variety of meats for tacos. They also have other options if you do not want tacos.The employees are nice. They have a salsa bar with different options as well."}
{"text":"I'm from Cali and it's been very hard to find some good authentic street tacos here in Vegas and I must say that these are pretty close. I'll difinetly go back here for my taco fix"}
{"text":"When it comes to tacos, I don't mess around. I have invested considerable time and effort to become, what I consider, a connoisseur.

In each city I have lived I have found the best tacos in town, and then become a regular customer. 

When I moved to Vegas, I was admittedly nervous -- I can't live without good tacos and Vegas is big... it could take months to find the best. Luckily, it didn't. It took two weeks (and 3 great reviews from Latino friends) to find Tacos El Compita. 

 The food is fresh, authentic, flavorful and juicy! It is just greasy enough to be good  Mexican food, but not so much as to cause post-lunch regret. 

I recommend the mulitas, typically with carne asada, or some chicken tacos. (Be warned, the chicken tacos can be a bit spicy if you order them with everything ... but OH SO DELICIOUS).

I went for lunch today, and I'll be back again next week."}
{"text":"They were really fast in making their food but it definitely didn't taste like those fast food Mexican places. It really tasted like REAL authentic Mexican food. The flavor that comes out of the tacos were just flourished with the taste of their culture. I loved it! And the price is definitely PERFECT for full-time college students."}
{"text":"First visit, we ate here specifically because I wanted a raspado (Mexican fresh fruit \"snow cone\" ) from the shop a couple doors down. The menu is simple yet covers all the basics. We went with a couple of tortas and split them ~ carnitas & carne asada, and I was pleased with both. The carnitas had some meaty chunks and a low grease factor and the carne asada was well seasoned with a slight kick. The sandwiches are put together well, with just the right amount of shredded lettuce, a slice of tomato, slices of avocado... and, of course, a grilled bun. Well done! Bring cash as they don't accept plastic."}
{"text":"Was looking around Yelp for lunch today and saw @Jennifer R's review.....after reading it and the other review of this place, I had to try it out.  I wanted to beat the lunch rush so I could get a table, so I got there around 11:30.....perfect timing.  I was the only non-Mexican patron in the restaurant (out of 12 people).

There are four 4 Top tables and one 2 Top table in the restaurant.  I snagged a 4 Top right in front of the counter and ordered a Carne Asada Burrito & a Carne Asada Taco.  Out of the corner of my eye I noticed a Jarritos Orange Soda in the cooler....of course I had to get one......sweetened with natural sugar & not HFCS, it's one of my fav's.

While I was waiting for my food, I went to the Salsa bar and prepared some Red (Hot), Green (Mild), and Pico de Gallo Salsa.  It's a small Salsa bar, but what it lacks in quantity it makes up in quality.  Then I no
ticed in the cooler an odd bottle that said \"Sangria\" on it.....What the Frijoles? (see pics)  So, I went to investigate.....turns out it's \"non-alcoholic\".....dammit, fools gold!  Who would drink that???  blech!

Within a few minutes my food was ready.  I went for the Taco first.....devoured it in 3 bites.....it was amazing!  The Carne Asada is marinaded with the same flavor I remember back in So Cal.....I think I found Taco Nirvana!  Then I went for the Burrito.....it's a nice size for $3.99, great value.  The Burrito didn't disappoint either!  It was amazing!  A quick note for the Gringos....if you order the Burrito with \"Everything\", it will already have Hot (Red) Salsa inside the Burrito....and it's pretty spicy, so if you're sensitive to that, tell them without salsa.  The Burrito had Carne Asada, Beans, Rice, Salsa, and Onions in it.....good proportions of all ingredients too.  Just like the Taco, the Asada's flavor was just right.

Overall, this place has just launched itself to the top of my Taco Shop list.  Thanks @Jennifer R for that review!

Will I return?  Orale, of course!"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic. But what ruined the experience for us was the amount of people  crammed inside, the number of running, screaming children, the uncomfortable religious portraits of a suffering Jesus, and the absolute dirtiness of the restaurant. 

The food was great, nonetheless. The menudo was menudo, which is usually decent, and the chicken mole was immensely flavorful. The mole was sweet, the chicken was moist, and the plate itself was literally overflowing with the amount that they generously lumped on. You could taste the chile clearly, as though it'd been slow cooked.

My fiancé ordered five asada tacos. The meat had a nice charred flavor and was the perfect texture. Unlike most places, it wasn't dry. 

Despite the wonderful food, which should have earned a five star, I'm afraid that the ambiance and the clientele just pulled this so far down. People kept staring at us...one man in particular. It was odd. There was so much yelling going on from both the customers and the kitchen that I could barely hear myself think. The floors were disgusting, to be blunt. The tables were not clean; I watched a bowl of old, half-finished menudo sit on a table the entire time were we there. There was no horchata (what I'd hoped for most) and there was no posole (also what I'd come for, but the menudo was alright). 

The Jesus portrait. I wish I could have sat across the room to avoid the somber, condemning stare. I don't mind religion, because that's an owner expressing themselves and their beliefs...but he was crying, bloody, mouth hanging open, and staring directly at us. Damn. Guadalupe's alter was fine. Like I said, I usually don't mind. 

The children's prize machines were just gross. I don't think they have been cleaned in years. And the children around them were pretty calm compared to the ones being forced to sit down and eat. This resulted in screaming. Wonderful. 

Service was alright. The woman at the front was pretty okay - nothing severely noticeable. But she was pretty busy, so I can't say anything negative. The total was a little much for what we ordered. Nowhere near as inexpensive as I'd assumed based upon other reviews. Taking a five minute drive over to Sweet Tomatoes or, hell, even Robert's would have cost less. The mole was definitely worth the cost, everything else was pretty \"meh\". 

If it'd been clean, I don't think the Jesus portrait, nor the costs, would have bothered us much. But honestly, and personally, cleanliness is almost as important as the food. Definitely would have rated it five stars for such awesome authentic cuisine."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! finally got the chance to come and check this place out. they have since increased the price of the tacos from $1.05 to $1.11. who cares though? because thats still HELLA cheap! 4 tacos fro $4.80...amazing. i ordered 2 asada, 1 carnitas, and 1 pollo...i wasn't brave enough to try the lengua even though it got good reviews. =P super quick service."}
{"text":"Loved this place! I stopped at Tacos El Compita for lunch driving from the strip to red rock and I'm so glad I did. I had the torta de carnitas and it was delicious- tasty, well-seasoned meat and with lettuce, tomato and avocado stuffed in toasty bread. Great flavor! If you're looking for quick, authentic mexican comfort food, definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"Great food, always busy, worth the wait Perfection. Had the steak burrito. Well deserved five stars."}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriend  looking for good street tacos  near  Summerlin (which can be tough!) Sorry Eastside Vegas, you have some of the best taquerias in town, but I can't risk it. We ordered 8 carne asada tacos and carne asada fries. The tacos were pretty good. Had a nice little spicy flavor to them and the carne was juicy, not dried out like other places. The carne asada fries were yuuge! Felt like I was on man vs. food. There was a little zest to them, which I didn't mind, but overall there was plenty of carne and toppings. Also, they used steak style fries instead of traditional fries, which I found better. Didn't have to stab my fork 20 times to get some fries! Overall, we enjoyed the food and you can't beat the price, $1.75 a taco!"}
{"text":"I am forgetting the name but the #6 sandwich with meat, cojita cheese and avocado is so good that I got it again within 24 hours of first trying it."}
{"text":"This is a legit taco shop with the best tacos! The meat and toppings are always fresh! The red salsa is to die for! If you haven't tried mulitas yet, YOU MUST. they're two taco tortillas and in between them is your choice of meat, melted cheese, pieces of avocado & onion! One order of mulitas comes with 3! =) This is the only GOOD taco shop that I've been to where tacos are still under $2. If you want to have real taco shop tacos,  come here. All of their other food is good as well. Tip: if you ever need a taquiza for parties, they do it as well! I had them for my party and everybody was asking me where these tacos were from! They are generous with their meat, and don't just try to fill you up with tortillas like some other taquizas."}
{"text":"Literally they have the Best mulitas EVERRRRRRRRRR !!!!! 
I come here atleast once a week for lunch."}
{"text":"Absolutely worth the drive!!!  The mulitas are absolutely awsome!  Best tortillas.  I'll be back"}
{"text":"The place to go for authentic tacos but the mulitas are truly the star of the show!!!  It's worth it to go a bit out of your way for this place. On you way out, grab some pan dulce next door, you'll be pleased!!!"}
{"text":"3 letters... Yum!!!!!!! So tasty and decadent  I get the steak burrito and it is to die for but not going to lie it isnt expensive but it can be a little pricey but you do receive a lot of food and your burrito is filled well. The seasoning they use is exquisite and really fills you up."}
{"text":"Best salsa in town! The carnitas are my favorite! Pastor is mediocre, but everything else is the best! Except the horchata, it's too sweet!"}
{"text":"I eat at this place entirely too often. This place is not some fancy sit-down restaurant, instead it's almost like Mexican fast food. The only difference is they don't sacrifice quality, and I would say it's one of my favorite Mexican places in the valley. You can't beat their burritos or mulitas."}
{"text":"I am actually in love with their carne asada burritos. Maybe someday I'll try something different, but I'll stop here after work when I want a burrito. The service is always pleasant to as well."}
{"text":"Was not good at all! Greasy and not cheap. We won't be going back! Oh and it took me a while to place order because their English was poor so of course they got it wrong!"}
{"text":"This food here is honestly some of the best food I've gotten out of these little mom and pop taco shops in Vegas ever!  The carne asada is perfectly seasoned and not over salted and the salsa is thick and flavorful, unlike the watered down salsa on the salsa bars you find in other places.  Everything I've eaten here has been amazing!!"}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place from a friend at work and ive been hooked ever since. They have the best carne asada in las vegas . Its not hard and has a spicy kick to it .The salsa bar is great made just right. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a mexican resturant!!!!!"}
{"text":"First time here and BEST FRICKEN TACOS! If your looking for some great mexican food this is the place."}
{"text":"Multias de asada are delicious! We will be here often. Sevier was quick and friendly!!!!!"}
{"text":"The Tacos are delicious and they were prompt with the service! The fact that the delivery was way ahead of schedule made me even happier! I would definitely recommend this place to everyone that has a craving for a Taco Tuesday! Only thing I can say is that the drink selection was limited... but the food was delicious so it made up for it"}
{"text":"Ordered camaron agridulce, mole poblano & chile verde. They were always so good!!! Try their caldo de res esp on a cold day, it never disappoints. I see most people order the pozole; I'm not a fan of tripe but they seem to be enjoying it. Maybe I'll try it next time.
Also, the restaurant has started accepting credit cards--- that's a big plus."}
{"text":"Asada Burrito, add cheese. Legit! Sometimes my burrito is hotter than others so you might want to ask for no salsa, and grab your own from the salsa bar."}
{"text":"Good restaurant for mexican food, the service is quick and the food is good (tortas and burritos), the horchata is incredible ! Big quantity...if you're hungry is perfect :-)"}
{"text":"SWEET BABY JESUS!! ORGASMIC!

So I LOVE tacos and any Mexican food for that matter; they have GREAT food here! The price, quality, and quantity is ace! Everything was seasoned PERFECTLY! I got the muelitas and ordered some carne asada tacos for my son. I went to the salsa bar and was a little hesitant to get salsa (I'm a visual eater and this didnt look yummy) but I got some anyway along with some limes. I went and got my beloved horchata and was in heaven because it was a self serve!! I took one drink and seen cherubs!! It was def love! 

We got home and I salsa and limed up my muelitas and took a bite; I swear the earth stopped for like 5 seconds and I seen angels flying around!! PERFECT! Thank goodness I got the hot salsa because it was delish!!!! The muelita melted in my mouth and I was in love; I couldnt get enough! The carne asada, cheese, and avocado was totally mastered! My sons carne asada tacos were wonderful! We ate all the food up!

The place is pretty large and just a plain seating area. Remember! Youre going for the food, and not the ambiance!! I've been to super pricey restaurants and the food was hella shitty!

Go here NOW! And bring an extra set of panties bc you may very well cream them!!"}
{"text":"Great carne asada tacos & burritos.I've been coming here for over 10 years & never been disappointed"}
{"text":"This place is a nice hole in the wall taco shop, I'm still partial to my taco place but this place is my stop when I want lunch while working. A co-worker introduced me to them and on an occasional taco Tuesday I'll stop by get el pastor. The meat is well flavored and their red sauce is just right."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying this; I am a Mexican food freak. If I could only eat Mexican food for the resting my life, I would die happy. This place is the best I have found in Vegas so far. The people working there are nice, but most importantly their food is amazing. Good tacos, burritos and their chili verde is awesome. This is my go to place. The thing that stands out the most is the green salsa at the salsa bar, it is to die for. Love this place, I'm a huge fan!"}
{"text":"Tried this place today and quite frankly I have no idea why this place has so many good reviews! I ordered the five taco special all carne asada and a drink-total was over $9.00! Wow that was not expected since the reviews below say the food was priced well too which it was not! The tortillas was good but very greasy from the grill. The carne asada was over cooked and dried out...flavor was bland not what you would expect from a Mexican place! Greasy food is not something I like and this qualifies as greasy! I love spicy bold flavors and I was not impressed at all! Growing up in LA I guess I was spoiled with great Mexican food but out here things are different. This place overall would get a no star review but I can't go this low. Lacks quality and flavor, I will not be going back."}
{"text":"First time here with my family and we absolutely LOVED it! Food is amazing and the cooks are unbelievably fast. 110% satisfied!"}
{"text":"Tried to open door at 8:5pm and it was closed. Closing hours is 9pm. The staff inside didn't want to let us in. What are business hours for then?"}
{"text":"Coworkers introduced me to this place.  The food is really good.  Not that I would know, but seems authentic Mexican.  (Taco Bell does not have beef tongue soup on the menu.)  I usually get the quesadilla and wash it down with a horchata.  The quesadilla is thick and flavorful.  Lots of cheese and meat.  I have also had a couple of their sandwiches, but cannot remember their name.  There is a hot sauce bar with pickled onions and hot peppers.  I recommend the onions, they are spicy hot.  Free refills on the drinks.  Me and my coworkers are usually the only non-hispanics in the joint.  Beware: when your food is ready they will call your number in Spanish.  Menu is inexpensive.  Food and atmosphere are not high society, but I sure enjoy my visits there.  Be sure to save room for dessert.  There is a fantastic Mexican bakery next door with delicious pastries at a super cheap price."}
{"text":"My husband and I eat here regularly... whenever one of us or anybody we know is craving some amazing Mexican food we come here.  The tortas are the best.  The food is always fresh and the people working there are super nice and helpful.  My husband had the chili Verde and said it was amazingly good with the just the right amount of heat. I especially love the salsa bar.  Again, everything is fresh and yummy!! Simply put it's some bomb ass Mexican food:)"}
{"text":"Best mexican place ever, everything taste great highly recommend a visit if you like the og taco joints"}
{"text":"I ordered the caldo de camarones, found it tasty but then an hour later, I had the MSG-overload effect. You know... the sensation after you eat Chinese food that you just can not get enough to drink? Soooo THIRSTY! The camarones, too, were as tough as old leather. I think they were in there just to flavor the soup, not meant to be eaten. The pastor taco was so cute - was about three inches long. Was ok, not the best I've ever had. Also tried the Ricas Cemita since it was highly touted on here. So, its like a sloppy joe with out the sloppy. Meh, ok. Did not blow my skirt up. Would be 50% better if they used good n' fresh buns.  

Look, I've had roll-your-eyes-back amazing Mexican food, from little hole-in-the-wall joints where I'm the only gringa within three miles. This is not it. What does perplex me is, with all the south-of-the-border folks here, legally and not, why the hell doesn't Vegas have some of THAT level of Mexican/Oaxacan/Salvadorean food options? I have to go to Santa Barbara for truly amazing gorditas. I have to go to San Jose for effin' phenomenal pastor \"devil\" tacos. That kind of food makes you want to drive three hours out of your way to enjoy. I'm left stunned with all the five star ratings with this joint. Have to assume our collective level for what makes real 5-star food has dipped. I it like an LA \"4\" is a Vegas \"10?\"

Back to Compita and the plus-es of the experience... service was nice, prompt and pleasant. The place was as clean as possible. The salsa bar was arctic-ly cold so all the goods were nice and fresh. They kept a good eye on the salsa bar and kept it stocked and clean. The caldo is enough to feed 2-3 people. The cemita will kill any hunger within three bites - man that thing was crammed full of meat chunks. (Quantity is not a problem here). Also, parking is easy, and its next to a panderia if you have a sweet tooth."}
{"text":"First time here not what I expected. Girl at the register serving food didn't even wash her hands touching her face. Food was not even that great. No ice"}
{"text":"Hard to find gold mine!!!  Amazing!  We had the mulito, carne asada, al pastor, and home made chips!!!  Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a total hole in the wall haven. Their tacos al pastor are SO good!! I also ordered a burrito al pastor. The meat had so much flavor!! This place is authentic, flavorful, and has friendly employees. And, they have really good prices!! A burrito, 2 tacos, and a soda all for like $8 total!!"}
{"text":"Omg their carne asada tacos are to die for. Although, I didn't like the tacos al pastor, the meat didn't taste like pastor meat (I'm Hispanic and a fan of tacos al pastor so I know what I'm talking about), it was dry and no pineapple (an essential ingredient in this type of taco - other places offer it as an optional ingredient but you can see it on the top of the el trompo and its juices contribute to the flavor of the meat. Overall, best place for tacos de carne asada but if you like tacos al pastor, Tacos El Gordo and Tacos El Buen Pastor serve them better."}
{"text":"My favorite taco place!!!! Reminds me of LA tacos.
The tacos are fresh!! And they make it right on the spot!. They finally take credit cards but its a 50cent charge. But still love them!"}
{"text":"I love tacos! Who doesn't love tacos? How could you not love tacos?
If you are like me and can't resist stopping in to a little shopping center taco shop that speaking English could be a problem in ordering, then go ahead and try Tacos El Compita. They have some pretty good tacos, but the star of the show for me was the Mulitas! These are a must!!!!
Actually I highly recommend getting both, the taco and the mulita, when I come back thats what I will be getting again."}
{"text":"Went twice in two days.  Very affordable, 5 delicious tacos for 7 bucks.  Sign me up.  Preferred way over Roberto's Taco Shop.  Speedy service, friendly staff."}
{"text":"My favorite mexican food in Las Vegas! Every time I come into town I make a stop here two or three times, depending on how long I'm in town. It is so good and tastes like home. The tortas are my favorite. Try this place if you get the opportunity. You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"holy moley. it hasnt been since my treks out to tj have i found tacos this amazing.

the meat. moist and fatty, but not too fatty. just the right amount of fatty

the tortilla. surprisingly subtle

the salsa bar. oh holy salsa bar. one of the best hot sauces ive had a chance to taste. giant jalapenos. radish, fresh onion, cilantro, lemon. and the pickled onion...i would make the 4 hour drive from so cal to lv just for those pickled onions, whose hotness factor can pwn even the most experienced of taste buds.

must return one day for their soups, which you will often see mexican locals slurping down just about every time you visit. 

and the sinker? the workers only speak spanish. how much more awesome can that get? its like walking through tj all over again.."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite spot for tacos. We got 7 tacos total for less than $15 and everything was so delicious. I had 1 asada, 1 lengua, and 1 pastor. My man had 2 carnitas and 2 asada--needless to say we both left very happy. My favorite though was the lengua. It is so tender and delicious!

Anyway if you are looking for a cheap and fast lunch on this side of town, check this place out. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"My 100th review is a tribute to \"street food\" - Tacos El Compita is in a strip center, and was fast and authentic.  We were limited on cash (forgot it was cash only in other reviews), but scraped together enough for a 5-taco plate (I got the juicy tongue/lengua, and the boy had 2 beef, 1 carnitas and 1 pollo), a side of sliced avocado, and 1 Mexican coke (bf only drinks h2o).  The food was fast, the salsa bar very nice (radishes, whole raw jalepenos, pico, onions and cilantro, very spicy salsas - loved the green especially).  The tacos had onions and salsa on them, and my poor bf doesn't do spicy food too well, so he got the avocado to cool him down while I was dipping it in the green sauce!

This place is cheap and yummy, a solid bet.  I would definitely return when I have cash.  The salsa bar had cups with lids so if we hadn't been on our way to Popcorn Girl, I would've taken some green salsa home!  I ate only one taco due to our limited budget and the bf's big appetite, but next time I may try a torta (highly recommended by the lady in front of us).  The guy sitting right behind me was selling pirated CDs and peliculas :)  No one seemed to bite every time they walked in and he called CDs! Peliculas!  CDs! Peliculas!

The best part was watching my bf go to his car to get change and count out quarters and dimes to buy me the Mexican coke :)"}
{"text":"I found it! This is truly a goldmine of mexican food. This is authentic mexican food! This is just like the food in socal! Not that american style stuff, the real stuff! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Honestly this place is the spot to eat at! But the customer service this restaurant consists of is absolutely  absurd... the food is divine honestly!, but the cashier that has been serving me lately is tremendously rude . I come into the restaurant ready to put in my order but the service that i have gotten from the cashier was so rude. I understand  that u guys close An hour from now but that doesn't mean u have the right to give shitty service, you know what you signed up for. Like I've said before... great place to eat but the service is fucking terrible!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Small hole in the wall taco shop and its to die for. Quick cooks, big bag of tacos for relatively cheap, and a salsa bar which lets face it is crucial. When I'm craving street tacos this is the only choice."}
{"text":"Cant get better Tacos and Mulitas for a better price. Makes it even better that the taste is good. Love their red hot sauce. As authentic as you can get imo. 

Will be a regular."}
{"text":"Love the Menudo, Love the tacos de Asada, and chicken quesadilla, the only thing that could make it better are homemade corn tortillas!"}
{"text":"If you want some bomb ass Mexican food, then come here! 
I've tried a lot of Mexican places & this place is really good. 
I ordered the combo #8, except I had no idea what came with it besides the meat since that part of the menu was in Spanish. But from the pictures on yelp, it looked really bomb. & I was right!!! #8 combo comes with Mexican rice, beans, tomato, lettuce, avocado, tortilla on the side, & your choice of meat - I chose pastor. The meat had so much flavor & wasn't too salty or bland. I was able to like make my own taco with the tortilla wraps on the side. 
My boyfriend got a pastor burrito & it was big & wrapped very nicely. He enjoyed it very much!


10/10 would recommend!"}
{"text":"Food is great. Been coming here since I was 6 years old. One of the best place to get tacos and other good food"}
{"text":"I'm upset at las Vegas yelpers, ive been let down before, but this was terrible. I had a carne asada burrito, came asada taco, carnita taco, and a cheese quesadilla....I'm happy I only threw away $13"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos! Really good quality food. Staff is nice. Excited to come back and try more items on the menu!"}
{"text":"This one is the best, best service awsome food will never change going to any other of the compitas again I will forever keep driving down to this place..."}
{"text":"I go twice a week to el compita #1 they gave me great service their fried onions and chiles toreados are the best they give me a plate full since I always do big orders but I moved nd now tacos el compita #2 is closer in one week I went in twice order my food and asked for the fried onions and chiles toreados I bought food for 4 people and the first time they gave me the fried onion nd chiles it was a joke and a waste of paper plate they gave me 2 chiles nd less than a small cup of onion so I let it slide the second time I went I order the same but this time I told them specifically to give me alot of onion and chile nd the girl said yes once I went to pick up she gave me again 2 chiles nd a handful of fried onions so I  asked for more her answer was we haven prepare more and we ran out so we can't give you more, I'm never going back to el compita #2 I rather drive 3.6 miles and go to the original compita, I suggest the owner if his employees aren't doing the top sells like in the compita #1 than your employees are the problem, hire new cook he also seems to almost eat people alive when asking for fried onions..  BAD SERVICE AND ATTITUDE FROM THE CASHIERS AND THE COOK ."}
{"text":"I LOOOOVVVVEEE this place.  Granted, no one speaks English there, but that's how you know they are for real!!! 

I have tried their menudo there, and it is pretty decent, and by that, I mean it is greasy enough!  My favorite is the lengua (tongue).  I'll have it either in tacos or mulitas.  

Another thing to love about Tacos El Compita is that they are FAST.  We would order 15 tacos, and it would be ready in 5 minutes.  The kitchen is an open kitchen and it is right there, so you can see everything for cleaniness and what not.  

One downside is that it is a cash-only \"cafeteria\" so be prepared; otherwise, you'll be stuck with a $3 fee for using their ATM inside. 

Go there!!"}
{"text":"i have been here for about 2 years now and had pretty much given up on authentic mexican food. One day i was driving and did a search and based on the rating decided to give it a try. I was not disappointed,unpretentious location,simple menu,delicious food. This place reminds me of the places i fell in love with mexican food. All i can say is that i enjoyed it very much,it was funny they call all the numbers in spainish and i was counting in my head ,i am a little rusty on my numbers then I realized it was me ! lol friendly hard working people I will return every chance i get :)"}
{"text":"It's ok. I ordered a carne asada torta and carne asada taco. Meat needed seasoning. Plenty of meat though. I had the green salsa from the salsa bar a little underwhelming. I don't know if I will try it again."}
{"text":"Hubs got the asada tacos I got the pozole. Tacos we're greAt but pozole tasted like they forgot to put seasoning in it. No flavor. I added green Chile from the salsa bar and it was great after that! I've had the pozole here before and it was delicious. Wish they had some specials on tacos. We got the 4 tacos, pozole and a drink snd it came to 17.00 A little pricy for a little hole in the wall Mexican place. We'll be back here."}
{"text":"Really close to my house, delicious and good price. Try the horchata. It is not home made but it is delicious. Had an al pastor torta that was too tasty"}
{"text":"Update: The Chile Verde Nachos are probably the best nachos I have ever eaten.

They. 
Are. 
Amazing! 

Thoroughly enjoyed every single thing we've had here. 

Mulitas are awesome and the new menu additions like nachos and sopes frigging rock! The mole poblano enchiladas are a little bit of heaven. Quite a deal at $6.50, too. 

Cemitas son Muy bueno! A meal and a half right there! Zippy, too!"}
{"text":"Another awesome meal!!  My husband and I love this place. The Mulitas are a must try :-). Everything's fresh and authentic. Just Come prepared to pay cash. No Debit or CC accepted. Prices are cheaper than Robertos."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place for the Caldo de Res. My favorite soup south of the border. 

I pretty much order this all the time at my favorite Lindo Michoacan. 

We had the Caldo as well as the number 8 with Carnitas. 

The Caldo was good. The meat was tender enough and the tortillas very hot. I just prefer the meat to be on the bone and it wasn't. The onions and accompaniments were just fine for us. 

The broth was very simple and delicious overall. 

I think that using plastic bowls, thin paper plates and plastic throw away spoons kind of affected  my thinking of this place and I don't feel the food was that fantastic to overcome this. It is hard to eat soup with chunks of meat and vegetables using a small plastic spoon. 

GK says come here for the food."}
{"text":"Real street tacos and authentic meats. The Mulitas came highly recommended and they did not disappoint. Like grilled cheese tacos. Place reminds me of a mini Tacos El Gordo. Good com we out fast enough for a quick lunch break."}
{"text":"If you're visiting Vegas... make the trek out to Tacos El Compita. Asada was tender and flavorful, Pastor was good with large chunks, not small charred chunks like most places. Decent seating area for a taco spot. Asada Quesadilla was clutch! Not dripping in grease or butter like most taco spots."}
{"text":"My 2nd favorite taco place in Vegas behind Tacos el Gordo.
Basically, soft tacos cost $1 and you can choose from asada, pastor, carnitas, chicken, and a couple others.  They also make great tortas, quesadillas, and some other things I don't know the name for.  
Great salsa bar that has, thank God, pico de gallo.  Most places just have the runny salsas - but I like the chunky pico de gallo.  Adds a lot of crispiness and freshness to any mexican food.
I also love their burritos - just meat, rice, beans, and salsa.  Highly recommended for cheap eats."}
{"text":"This restaurant is so unique whenever they're out of cup holders they give you a huge box. I loved it. The food is great too, had mulas de asada y lengua yummmy"}
{"text":"While I think the cabeza here is on point, this visit some of the meats were a bit fatty and gristly compared to my last review. It was more noticeable in my MILs pastor torta and she's more of a \"taster\" taking small bites so she had to pick at hers. 

I still thought the flavor was good on their meats, but just a noticeable difference in quality with the pastor mostly. The lengua, cabeza ones I ordered were fine. Everything came out piping hot and fresh though. I noticed a few reviews that's touted this fatty gristle from the past so perhaps it's inconsistent with trimming.  This is just my second time so not exactly sure if there are more good days than bad. Pick out the bites you don't like? 

I noticed a ton of people on this day were ordering various soups. Caldo de res seemed the most popular so I might come back for that. I saw on the menu menudo, caldo camerones and birria as well. I went on a weekend and most places serve that stuff on a weekend only so I am not sure if this is a all week item as I didnt really pay the most attention to the wall menu closely.

It may be tacos el Compita but it seems that the Hispanic community seems to go caldo route. I'll come back and follow what everyone else is ordering next time."}
{"text":"Great food! Small local spot for delicious Mexican food."}
{"text":"Great street tacos, really enjoyed the Mulitas.  We Had to take our Pozole to go -- it was too hot to enjoy in the limited time we had to visit.  Busy but service was fast and friendly - we had never had Mulitas before and they took time to explain them to us (we had read a great review for them but the menu isn't too descriptive and the menu picture doesn't do it justice!) very reasonable prices.  Will return!"}
{"text":"So picture Roberto's. But now take away the inconsistent Carne Asda and the way you feel sick sometimes afterwards, and replace that with an extremely moist, tender Carne Asada and you have a better understanding of Tacos El Compita. I tried it for the first time the other day, and I was very impressed. It is right in my neighborhood so I will definitely return. They also have pretty awesome soft tacos. The taco plate comes with like six and it is all very reasonably priced here. The salsa bar seemed a lot like Roberto's. I was digging the red sauce. Try this place, you most likely won't be disappointed. Make this place 24/7 and open more locations and this place would be perfect. I can't wait to return and try some other stuff."}
{"text":"Love this place! If you're looking for some real authentic Mexican food this is the place, very small and crowded but it's so good I don't mind just taking it home"}
{"text":"The highlight of my journey to Tacos El Compita was definitely the atmosphere. As I opened the door, I was greeted by 115dBs of Mexican tunes, brightly painted walls including a depiction of Jesus and the Virgin Mary, a man selling knockoff movies, a horchata machine and a cooler filled with paletas. I was transported south of the border. Directly behind the counter, you could spy their huge grill with flames shooting out from beneath simmering pots.\"Nice,\" I thought. \"Bring on the tacos!\"  

I ordered a taco plate with one pollo, 3 pastor and one carnitas and awaited a taco symphony. The tacos were definitely cheap, like $1.25/taco, and unfortunately, for me, the quality of the taco reflected the price tag. I found the meat to be of low quality, and the toppings to be meager. The flavor profiles were disappointing as well. I love a street taco that tastes as if it is straight off the grill; here, they tasted like they were just reheated. And, I left with the mediocre-quality belly ache. I decided the only remedy was a bike ride. 

As we were leaving, I noticed a lot of people who appeared to be regulars were ordering the soups, so perhaps that's the jam here, but the tacos disappointed me."}
{"text":"You have to order the carne asada burrito it's amazing. And they only take cash but there is an ATM inside in case you need it. My daughter was a little disturbed by the bleeding Jesus mural in the wall."}
{"text":"As a California native this place definitely hit the spot. Got the carne asada quesadilla and chicken tacos. Nice that they're not stingy with salsa and you can load up a paper plate with their salsa bar :)"}
{"text":"Simply amazing! I always get 2 tacos de tripas and 2 of cabesa. This place hasn't failed me. 
BOMB.COM!"}
{"text":"I live their quick service..place is always clean. Foord is always on point. Can't complain."}
{"text":"I love going here to get that L Pastore tacos they're my favorite along with an ice cold sangria. I don't think you can get more authentic Mexican tacos unless you went to Mexico so if you like tacos I would definitely hit this place up"}
{"text":"Open at 8am, it's Sunday morning and we are craving tacos!  We're one of the first few in the door, and ready for some good food.   It was ready pretty quick, we got a couple of tacos and a quesadilla.  The taco's are one of each, pastor, and lengua, or tongue, and very good, the meat is seasoned very well, and it's tender.  With the added chopped onion and cilantro, it gets even better.

The quesadilla is asada, very tender, smothered with cheese and very gooey.  I absolute love this place."}
{"text":"4 1/2 stars is way too high for this taqueria. The meat is pre-cooked, stored in metal bins, and slapped into tortillas versus being hot and cooked fresh like many of it's competitors.

The carnitas lacked flavor and character. The carne asada was decent but nothing outstanding.

The best authentic tacos I've had in Las Vegas are at Tacos el Gordo but this would do in a pinch if you're starving for tacos and close by."}
{"text":"This is the number one spot in town! Real Mexican food as authentic as it gets. They have mastered the basics and so much more. With 3 amazing locations all over the valley. These restaurants have been giving back to the  community for years! Check out the teams they've sponsored. Be sure to check them all out! A true family favorite!"}
{"text":"Best pork tacos I've ever had! Staff is very friendly and helpful. My wife loves the carne asada tacos too. The nacho chips are hand made and stay crunchy instead of getting soggy. They also have Coca Cola and Sprite from Mexico which is amazing. We have \"street taco Sunday\" every week and don't go anywhere else to get them."}
{"text":"I went there 30 minutes before they closed and didn't have high expectations. I observed them cleaning up getting ready to close. I got al pastor, carne asada and chicken tacos. I also got a small side of beans and rice. The al pastor was the best. The chicken was ok but kind of dry. The rice was flavorful but dry if that makes any sense. Some of the beans were hard so that was a bummer, but again they had good flavor due to the BEAN JUICE!!?? LOL The guacamole on top of the carne asada taco was REALLY GOOD! I give it a 3 1/2. I'll definitely try them again when they're not so close to closing."}
{"text":"Best Sopes and Burrito in LV! Best ASADA in town, LA style...closest thing to Cali...Yes! ...found my spot."}
{"text":"Rather than go to Zaba's for the second time in one week, which my son wanted to do, we hit up Tacos El Compita for some authentic Mexican eats.  It's been a while, so since we've been gone, they have expanded the place.  The night we went, though, it was deserted, but that just meant that we got quicker service.  Three carnitas tacos for me and four chicken tacos for mi hijo to go came to a whopping $9 plus change--much cheaper than Zaba's and muy delicioso.  We need to remember to come here more often.  Muchisimas gracias!"}
{"text":"My search is over. I've sampled innumerable taco joints in Vegas, and while most do a decent job, there's usually something lacking that makes them a one-time stop. At last, I've found El Compita. Been to 2 locations and they are equally good. Best carnitas torta I've tried, in fact everything's great: tacos, mulitas. Two great salsas that you can grab yourself. Great value too. It's like stepping into Mexico itself. The guy in line in front of me had a \"13\" tattooed on his head, as in the LA gang, and the girl in front of him was probably 6 yrs old carrying a 2 yr old. Almost thought I had to pay in pesos, but if you want the real deal in terms of food, this place hits the spot."}
{"text":"This place is located in a smaller, older strip mall just off Buffalo & Summerlin Pkwy on Westcliff. It looks a little shady for this particular area but not as bad some of the places on the east side or in North Las Vegas. The store front is very unassuming and a bit run-down. When you walk in, it's borderline hole-in-the-wall but clean for its age and condition. I love these places really. It usually means the food is good; this place did not disappoint.

I was greeted by a Hispanic woman behind the counter who thought I was Hispanic also, as she started speaking to me in Spanish. When I replied back in English, she did her best to communicate with me in English but it was difficult to understand through the thick Hispanic broken English. The cook jumped in the conversation to make sure I was ordering what I wanted. Another good sign this was going to be a good place to eat; it's authentic!

For this visit I went with three tacos; the asada, pastor, and pollo, along with a side of tortilla chips and 500ml made-in-Mexico Coca Cola served in a bottle (this means it was made with sugar, not the high fructose corn syrup). I came in at a quiet time too as I was the only customer in the restaurant. So that was good.

I picked my table and in a few minutes, my order was ready. The street-style tacos were served on a paper plate and the tortilla chips in a closed styrafoam container. I took my time eating each one. Very flavorful and delicious. I usually will hit up Tacos El Gordo when I'm in the mood for street tacos, but this place is much closer to where I live and I will definitely be making a return visit."}
{"text":"Ordered the beef soup and it was pretty good. The hubby is upset about his tacos because they didn't have guac on them. I prefer going to the westcliff location more."}
{"text":"Very impressed. I liked their mulitas and the food is pretty close to authentic. Downside, they don't sell tortillas with their pound of carne."}
{"text":"I tried pozole. It was so good! This place is very busy!! Will definetly come back for pozole. :)"}
{"text":"Huge fan. I always get al pastor tacos and or mulitas. Fast service cheap price and quality food"}
{"text":"This is My fav taco place hands down! I literally here at least 3 times a week! It's so addicting!"}
{"text":"This food was AMAZING! It was hot, fresh flavorful. The carne asada fries had big moist fresh seasoned fries, fresh grilled steak well seasoned. The tacos were amazing. Will order again"}
{"text":"A friend and I wanted to have dinner near his house and we saw this place on Yelp. The ratings were very good and now I can see why - the food is out of this world and VERY authentic (by that I mean it's similar to what you'll find when vacationing in Mexico). You see, most Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas serve up the usual standard fare of tacos, rice and beans to the unsuspecting SUV masses fresh from the mall who don't know any better.Not this place. The food is cooked to order and is just bursting with flavor. Although the place has no real atmosphere to speak of, it's the kind of place that's ideal for a take-out experience whereby you pick up the food and then outside to a city park to feast on it. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I go here twice a week, the best authentic mexican food in vegas in my opinion, great food, great people, great service!!"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos, delicious mulitas, quick service. As good as it gets!"}
{"text":"I hail from the Taco Capital of the World, Los Angeles, CA. Where you can find a Tacos Stand on every corner on Friday and Saturday night. I've had good tacos in my 27 years in this world. I have to say, these tacos are the best tacos I've ever had!
I get the Al Pastor tacos and as I'm writing this, I am craving them again and I just had some yesterday. I get my tacos with some chips on the side and with green sauce. My Fiancée gets mulitas which she and so agrees it is the best mulita she's ever had.
In my opinion Tacos El Gordo is a gourmet Taco spot which is okay but if your like me, and you prefer the street style Taco, this is the place for you. I prefer a El Compita Taco over a El Gordo Taco any day of the week.
Overall awesome food that easily overshadows customer service since they don't really try it. Lol. Most of the time because they speak little English. But the food is too good that I can come here and have them cuss me out and I wouldn't care as long as they make me some of their tacos."}
{"text":"They have Mulitas!!! And the Asada tacos were tasty!! I found this place cuz of yelp and I will definetely be going back to this place. And there's a pan dulce shop next door."}
{"text":"this place has decent run of the mill mexican food....dont get me wrong- its definetely authentic with the pickled carrots and radish but there is better mexican food out there! i know im biased being from southern california but hey i just have high standards! (and too bad i cant yelp my family's AMAZING homemade food ha!) anywho...still keeping my fingers crossed to find authentic good mexican food in vegas....the search continues...."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Great Menudo and of course great tacos. I get the carne asada and lengua"}
{"text":"When I asked my Mexican neighbor where he loves to eat at he responded \"I may not know a lot of different foods but the one thing I do know is good Mexican food and El Compita is the best\".  I have to agree.  If you want the best Carne Asada or Barbeque Pork Tacos in Vegas this is the place.  There Carne Asade Burritos are amazing and although I don't eat a lot of other stuff the other items seem super popular, especially the Tortas and Sopas. The green and red salsa is amazing and by far the best I have ever had anywhere.  I also love their marinated onions with Habanero and the pico de gallo in their salsa bar.  I have now eaten here over a hundred times and have never experienced even one bad meal.  Once you have eaten here twice you will be addicted forever.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love Mexican food, but I don't like Mexican food that is overloaded with salt.  In fact, writing this and thinking about my meal a few weeks ago is already making me feel dehydrated.  Perhaps, I ordered the wrong thing.  Perhaps it was a bad batch.  My husband and I shared the Pastor Burrito and after the first bite, the saltiness was too much to bare.  We also ordered a couple of tacos (carne asada and chicken) and those were both OK.  

We also ordered a chicken quesadilla for my toddler daughter, and once I got past the greasiness (which is to be expected), it was OK too.  The only item I actually enjoyed was the Horchata.  I shall continue my search for a great hole-in-the-wall Mexican joint."}
