{"text":"Wow, what a pleasant surprise.  I was expecting just a steak house but the menu is extensive with a great Mexican, Italian and Greek twist.  Yes, it's difficult to choose what to have but I found the Taco Mario Tio amazing!  Reminds me of an authentic Mexican restaurant, can't wait to try this place again!"}
{"text":"Was there for dinner with my daughter. The service was terrible. Found out that there was only 1 waitress for the whole restaurant. The drinks were completely full of ice.  Talk about water down drinks. I ordered the surf and turf fajitas. 3 small pieces of shrimps a few sliced up pieces of steak and a hell of alot of green peppers and a few sliced mushroom. All that for 24 dollars. Yes that's right $24.00. My daughter ordered one of their sandwiches and talk about where's the beef??? Took a bite into it and bit into one of those sweet sliced sandwich pickles you buy in the grocery store. BICKS.  I will never go there again."}
{"text":"The restaurant serves quality food for an amazingly low price, however the drinks we ordered were on the small and frugal quantity for a martini and pint of beer. Their wing special on Thursdays is an amazing deal, you get 10 wings including a well seasoned serving of fries for only $6. We ordered all three flavours which included honey garlic, barbaque and habanero chipotle. The honey garlic and habanero chipotle were much more flavourful and satisfying compared to the barbaque. Comfy atmosphere, good prices and free parking are great aspects of the restaurant, however I would like to see an improvement with the quantity in alcoholic drinks. The martini was filled about half way and the pint of beer was on the small side."}
{"text":"Was expecting completely different food/atmosphere based on the name, but was pleasantly surprised to find a Mexican vibe. Very good nachos (unique and excellent) and delicious churros. Definitely recommend. And Chico was great too. Very personable staff. Good meal all around."}
{"text":"This place must be going out of business.  CASH ONLY (written on chalk board & waitress says the debit has been broken for a while); draft beer taps don't have any draft so only bottled beer; ordered a $27 rib eye steak but look like a super thin No Frills strip-loin. When we  expressed our dismay about the steaks we heard the chef yell \"If they don't like it they don't have to eat it.\"  

Decor was nice but had the radio on listening to McDonald's and Sunwing ad's in a \"gastric pub\" charging $27 for a steak. Trying to be something it's not.

Feel really bad writing this."}
{"text":"Great owner, very affable. Have had the flank steak twice and it was great. However, this evening was my birthday so we decided to treat ourselves. We started with guacamole, which was in need of cilantro. We then went for the rib eye, which was supposed to be served \"Chicago style\" -this means grilled to desired doneness, then charred. I asked for the steak rare. It came medium, with a sauce on top and no char. The garlic potatoes were ice cold. We were very disappointed, and doubt we will return. For  a meal costing over $100, this was a definite disappointment."}
