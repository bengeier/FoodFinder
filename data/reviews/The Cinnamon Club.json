{"text":"Very disappointed with the Liane Carroll gig on 8th November. First visit to Cinnamon Club and probably the last. Not impressed with the acoustics, view was very poor because Liane was at ground level and we had to watch through a table of four who insisted on talking and joking through the whole performance. Liane Carroll is an absolute favourite of ours, we saw her at the Grand in Clitheroe earlier in the year which is a fabulous modern venue, but the addition of an overrated trumpet player only detracted from her impeccable vocals. Big disappointment considering we travelled 40 miles to get there!  Why not put her on the stage and have normal seating, suppose my £9 for a beer and small glass of wine explains that."}
{"text":"Some would say that The Cinnamon Club is the Ronnie Scotts of the North, I would whole heatedly agree! Not only can you see the greats and new Blues Soul and Jazz artists, but also seriously talented musicians of other genres. With a fully sprung maple dance floor, and an arched ceiling towering above you at over forty feet, it is a venue for all occasions... and makes a welcome change from propping up the bar in your local. You can book tickets on-line in advance and can be as cheap as £5! The venue is really spacious, and it has many tables where you can sit and enjoy the music and their very fine wines. Whats more, the beautiful Edwardian building creates a very intimate atmosphere, I fully recommend it too if you are into your dancing, you will see many a competent swinger on the dancefloor alongside simply merry couples enjoying a little boggie together.   You can hire the club as a venue for a special occasion too, they will supply a band, food and wine. They also have classes on week nights if you want to brush up in your Jive or Latin moves."}
{"text":"This is a gorgeous place.  Foodies and music lovers will love this joint.  The beautiful Edwardian building plays host to some of the finest proponents of blues, soul and jazz play as you relax over a delicious meal.   It's refreshing to see the menu changing weekly and there is plenty on offer in terms of snacks and light bites. There is a stylish Bistro and a Lounge, each with its own bar, and a grand, arched ceiling overlooks a superb, maple-sprung dance floor. They have live music which is performed every Thursday and Friday and a top-of-the-range PA system ensures that every note is crystal clear. Members of the Club receive the added benefit of free entry to The Lounge and are also invited to meet the musicians at the interval and after the gig in the restaurant bar.   The Cinnamon Club is a unique style ans versatile venue which makes it exceedingly popular for private parties, corporate events and weddings..... and a very cool name to boot !!"}
