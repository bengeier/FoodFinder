{"text":"I've only been when it was about to close but the pancake still tastes good.   1. Brown sugar/peanut pancake - Great warm snack any time of the day. Not too sweet and would go nicely with tea or coffee."}
{"text":"I wanted to try the ice here but only ended up getting the red bean walnut cakes. Delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"I can seriously eat a korean brown sugar pancake every day! They are always warm and freshly made, quality is consistent and very quick and friendly service.  Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Brown sugar pancakes... Heavenly!!!! I had them fresh so it was nice and toasty and warm. I also tried all three walnut cakes.  They are nice, but I preferred the pancakes more. Maybe because these were not warm when I got them. Super inexpensive. And the line moves fast.  There's also seating on the inside. Will come back to try the other desserts."}
{"text":"Red bean pancakes and walnut cakes are the best. Place is busy for a reason!"}
{"text":"I don't know how I could've passed by this little bakery so many times without ever stepping inside!   I stopped here on a Thursday night because I was craving something sweet after dinner. At first my friend thought that the basket of little walnut shaped cakes they had displayed at the store front window were actual walnuts, he wouldn't believe me when I told him they were the \"walnut cakes\".   We tried the red bean walnut cakes. While munching on them on the tables at the back of the bakery, we overheard one of the cashiers telling another customers that you should try the mash potato ones first to enjoy them more.   In the short 5 min time span that my friend and I sat in the bakery eating our goodies, a lineup had formed. This was a real surprise for us since it was 8pm on a weekday! Most people purchased it to go.   Prices are fair. If I remember correctly, it was $2 for 6, $8 for 30, and $17 for 70. In addition to the famous walnut cakes, they also sell korean pancakes and korean sorbets.    I will definately be back to try the mash potatoe flavored ones next time."}
{"text":"-The walnut cakes were hot and delicious -Staff was very friendly and polite towards me -Great price point"}
{"text":"This place sells walnut cakes and a few other dessert items.  I'm not partial to anything with red bean paste so I only had the mashed potato /walnut and mashed potato/almond ones.  They were great and I wish I had bought more than six.  They are only $2.25 for 6 cakes.  The cakes are really shaped like a walnut from the special molds they are made in.  I got them when they were fresh off the conveyer and I think I would want to do that again.  I went back a few days later and tried the pancakes stuffed with sugar which also really good.  Will be coming back here again soon."}
{"text":"Oh, those little bundles of potato-y joy. I always intend to savour my allotted 6... but by the time I arrive home, alas, my little paper bag is empty. I have only had the one flavour... and I keep thinking, \"Does there need to be another flavour?\" I would be perfectly happy with the one, forever-and-ever-amen.  Also, watching the little hodo kwaja machine is a joy in and of itself."}
{"text":"Whoa! Yet another accidental find for me. Was headed to an electrical store in the neighbourhood when I noticed the production of walnut cakes. Everyone coming out of the store had a smile. I loved my brown sugar pancake and my partner his red bean one. Yum!!"}
{"text":"Tried out their walnut red bean cakes, I like it. I will say 4 stars. Others products are 3 stars. Still recommend to try if you never have a walnut cake like me."}
{"text":"The cashier was very friendly and helpful. All that can be said is said in other reviews. My favourite is the red bean pancake. Enjoy it. Savour it. Just give this store a chance and you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Delicious! Stopped in on a whim today after walking by many, many times. The staff behind the counter was super friendly and helpful. There were 3 flavours - 2 with potato and one with red bean. While all were delicious, the red bean was much better, plus it was still warm. I think next time I would go solely with red bean."}
{"text":"What can I say?  Good price? Check Good amount of snack servings? Check Quality of food? Awesome  If you're looking for a treat for you and your friends this is the place to go. 30 Walnut Cakes for $8 no tax.  I do however not recommend this place for anyone trying to lose weight as these desserts are as addicting as it gets."}
{"text":"Aweful service. The brown sugar pancakes that we ordered were pretty cold -- traditional Korean pancakes are supposed to be freshly made and sold.. the ones we got were pre-made and lukewarm. When we asked for hot ones the server defensively shot back and said she can't reheat food items that were already taken out. She ended up microwaving the pancakes (with tremendous attitude), only 3 of the 5 that we ordered lol.. never going back, that's for sure."}
{"text":"Walnut cakes were ok tbh, buuuut the pancake with melted brown sugar alone is worth at least 5 stars. Just get two of those for yourself and go to town! Red bean is good too but I thought brown sugar had the edge."}
{"text":"Hodo Kwaja always smells warm and inviting and their walnut cakes are always fresh. Red bean is usually the go-to, but potato and walnut are just as delicious. Each cake fits into the palm of your hand, and the filling really takes center stage. The surrounding cake isn't very thick, but is just enough chew and sweetness to encapsulate the filling in one...maybe two...bites. The piece of walnut hidden somewhere in the filling gives a nice, surprise crunch.  The walnut cakes are great warm as a snack and are great as leftovers, too, if you can stop yourself from eating the whole batch! Warmed up or straight from the fridge...they're a real treat!"}
{"text":"This place stands the test of time. It was the first of it's kind to set up shop in Toronto and still standing long after the others have closed. Whenever I am in the area I always drop by to pick up some Ho Deok and the walnut cakes. The brown sugar pancakes (ho deok) heat up really well in the toaster oven and make a great snack the next day!"}
{"text":"You know all that loose change you have jingling in your pockets?  You could spend it on some trans-fatty processed crap from the convenience store that'll make you feel a little gross after you eat it; or head over to Korea Town for fresh walnut cakes filled with wholesome sweet potato or red bean.  Six little walnut cakes (called \"hodo kwaja\" in Korean), stamped out by an ornate machine, are just $1.50. How? (Lack of unions?)  The hodo kwaja look like walnuts but have a sponge cake layer on the outside while the puree filling is dense and smooth. They're not too sweet in that subtle Asian tea-snack way.  I'm dying to have them hot off the press and am considering stalking the premises to get them super fresh. Who's with me?"}
{"text":"I love coming here to get these walnut balls! They are so addictive. I would come here purposely just to buy these.   All their flavors are good, but I particularly like the RED BEAN one. I find the red bean one the most tasty.   These are tiny, so its great for a snack-size dessert."}
{"text":"Very friendly service. we had 12 pcs of the walnut cakes; mixed flavors. the server double checked our allergies. I enjoyed the potatoes and red bean flavors the most...not too sweet just nice. it was a great treat after dinner"}
{"text":"Very unique Korean bakery! Delicious red bean or potato walnut cakes! A great dinner party gift or just for yourself."}
{"text":"Best walnut cakes!  Used to live dt now this place is too far for me. But whenever I go to korean town I always stuff my face silly with them walnut cakes.  Their pancakes w brown sugar filling is another delight!"}
{"text":"This is a small factory that makes 3 or 4 different types of bakery snacks.  We went for the walnut cakes.  They were very fresh and tasted great  they have new different flavours in the walnut cake.  Walnut,  almond and red bean."}
{"text":"Get the red bean, it's the original and the best! Their pancake is good too except sometimes the filling is sometimes too little or isn't spread around equally. Still their stuff is good!"}
{"text":"we went there on a busy day and got both the red bean and brown sugar pancake and the girl at the cashier recommended the walnut cake which i am glad i bought as well.  but what blew me away was  the awesome customer service, i know i am being a bit dramatic but it's hard to find polite workers these day.   this was my first time trying out this Korean treat so i was a bit indecisive about what to get but the she patiently explained all the flavors and what would go best with what (very helpful)  we went further in to store to sit but it was packed , but when we were leaving the  girl apologized for the lack of siting space (C'mon! who does that )    Overall i enjoyed the food and would go back a thousand times if it wasn't a bit far from my area."}
{"text":"I cannot BELIEVE people don't like Red Bean Paste. I will gladly eat anything Red Bean Paste. Yum.  The Walnut Potato ones are good too, but just not the same. A dozen walnut cakes for $3 is the perfect dessert for two - great for stopping in after eating Korean food in the neighborhood.    Bonus is the friendly service. The lady actually giggled when I thanked her with a \"kamsa hamnida!\"  Walnut cakes are great because they are still rare enough  that you can still delight and surprise people with them. Great to bring a little box to a party."}
{"text":"The owners of this Hodo Kwaja place are such kind people. The ahjusshi knows me by name now, and is always smiley no matter what time of the day I walk in at. I like it when places remember my name, it offers a much more personal and appreciative service. This is definitely my favorite place to pick up Hodo Kwajas, I've tried other places and nothing in Toronto measures up to this place.   The Hodo Kwajas come with 2 different types of filling (you can chose or mix). There's one with red bean paste, and another with more golden color filling, I think it might be sweet potato? Get them while they're fresh out of the machine! They also serve crushed ice with red beans and other stuff... but my favorite thing to get here are the madeleines. I had my first taste when the owner handed me a free one to try during one of my first visits way back in the day, and have been obsessed with them since. Although they're not much like the traditional madeleines, and are closer to little cakes, they're still soo yummy. Give me a glass of soy milk and I can eat a whole box in one sitting (probably not something to be proud of though). I brought them into work once and after getting a taste, my coworker went out and bought some of her own, they're addictive!"}
{"text":"Unlike the gringo reviewers below, I actually love the flavour and texture of the red bean paste.  :)  I have tried all three things that they offer:  the walnut cakes, the hotuk and the bing-soo (a.k.a. red bean sorbet).  Since the other reviewers have gone in depth of the walnut cake and ho-tuk, I will carry on to the red bean sorbet.  It is basically shaved iced, that is sweetened.  Then it is topped off with milk powder (almost like Coffee-Mate), and sweet red beans.  I found this combination quite refreshing in the summer!  Not only that, I was eating some good soy protein... hey, pretty good for any dessert.   Bing-soo is definitely not for everyone, but if you can break your conception of the traditional icecream and want to try something with more interesting textures, then I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I love their Red bean sherbet. It's one of the best Korean summer desserts. Hodo Kwaja makes decent Korean desserts! Try their walnut or custard filled desserts. They're good ;)"}
{"text":"These treats are gems!   I've been here on multiple occasion to try their walnut cake and their walnut pancake and I am in love! Their treats are just the right level of sweetness and have a great consistency that straddles creamy and fluffy perfectly. I have gotten their huge boxes and they last quite well when stored in the fridge and heated in a toaster oven however nothing beats a freshly made one.   The pancake is great, nothing special about it as my girlfriend's roommate has proven that it can be made quite easily but considering I don't have the ingredients on hand, they have a winner in these!  Haven't tried their hard waffles yet and I'm not sure if i ever will consider how stuck on I am to their walnut cake.   Stick with the red bean walnut cake, the potato filling isn't for all and I've noticed that other than myself none of my friends or family have taken a liking to them."}
{"text":"Okay, I want to give this shop a good rating because I used to go there couple years ago.... and it tasted BETTER and was CHEAPER  BUT,  today, I went there to get 6 pieces of walnut cake... although they were making new ones... they gave me the ones that they made in the morning, despite that fact that I asked if the one I got was freshly baked or not... and the didn't taste as good as before... I wonder why.  FYI, its $2 for 6 pieces now... not $1.50."}
{"text":"Excellent deserts at a good price.  The red bean walnut cakes are delicious and surprisingly filling.  Key is they aren't too sweet and have a great bite.  I wish they were served warm more often though!  Warm transforms them into unexpected greatness."}
{"text":"Only came here for the \"Korean timbits\". Did not disappoint at all."}
{"text":"Yep, I was with these yelpers below while we tried these little walnut shaped bundles, and yes, they are very good! What I really liked is the contraption at the front that makes these little pastries. I've walked quickly by it in the past but never really looked at it in action, so now, at an earlier time in the day, I'm going to have to check it out while it's going.   I think my favourite was the walnut and potato flavour, but they were all good. And how do they make them so cheap.   I also noticed that drinks and other things at the place were also cheap too."}
{"text":"Tried their red bean walnut cake, 6 pieces for $2.25! They are really good, Worth to try it!"}
{"text":"Came here after dinner in Korea town. Tried the 3 types of walnut cakes, 6 for $2.25. The cake was a little too moist/spongy for my liking but overall was a good treat, not too sweet. Service was friendly and server was very informative."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years 15 plus years. Always a great treat.  Fresh and tasty walnut cakes. The service is very friendly.  Make sure you buy enough if you don't live in the area  Great with coffee"}
{"text":"A good place! One of my many favourite places to visit when I'm here.  My favourite is the red-bean Korean walnut cake.  Half are filled with sweet potato, and the others are filled with red bean paste. They also have sweet-potato walnut cakes as well as green-bean walnut cakes, but the red-bean ones are my pick! A TOONIE & A LOONIE RECOMMENDATION: 12 walnut cakes for $3.  Them shits will eat like a meal (recommended for non-continuous consumption only)."}
{"text":"This is my favourite joint in Koreatown for a quick snack. They specialize in \"Ho-Do-Gwah-Jah\" or walnut cakes. They come in 3 different flavours. I highly recommend the red bean!   They also serve \"hot-deock\" Korean pancake with brown sugar or red bean. In the summer, the bingsu- shaved ice with red bean is a good option to cool off after a day at Christie Pits.   A mix of 6 walnut cakes costed $2.15 plus a charge for debit totalling $2.40. Fairly reasonable for these tasty snacks.   Tip: Ask for the fresh ones. They taste best when warm.   5 stars for the friendly workers who ask customers about nut allergies or dietary restrictions."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, I was pretty excited to try this place. We stopped by on Sunday afternoon, and the guy working there was super friendly. So why the low rating? They were out of the pancakes -- which was okay, because apparently they won't make them on Sundays and someone came by and bought all of them.. and the guy working there was really nice and gave us an extra walnut cake. BUT.. these walnut cakes were premade from who knows when, and they were SO stale. They were mushy, like when you put away freshly made, hot pancakes directly into a sealed bag/tupperware, and let it sit and cool like that. The outside of the cake was clammy and mushy, and the inside of the cake part was dry. The filling tasted fine, but these cakes definitely needed to be eaten hot and when the edges are a little crispy... He was taking them out from these covered styrofoam containers, and they were not presented the way you seem them in some of the pictures on yelp.  I understand that they wanted to remain open after selling out the pancakes even when they weren't making anything fresh just to sell what they had left, but i don't understand how they can sell old products without warning the customers. I bet they taste good when they're fresh, but i'm so disappointed in the quality. Maybe one day when I pass by again, I will try them again IF they have something fresh.   Point is: don't try these if they aren't being made fresh, you'd be better off buying some frozen ones and baking them/reheating at home."}
{"text":"I love, love, love bakeries and this one is simple, kinda dive-y but they specialize in a few areas, one being the walnut cake! At first, I confused them with the Chinese little pancake balls (sorry I do not know the correct terminology), the lady at the counter correct me that they were not the same thing - similar but different tastes.   As you enter the store, they have their walnut cakes operations setup in front of you. There are three different walnut flavours, walnut + potato, red bean and almond + potato. My favourite was red bean, walnut + potato came a close second.   You will be surprised to find that this place also has other desserts items. My date and I ordered the red bean dessert, which consists of red beans, fruit, served over ice and condense milk. Oh so good! I know it is sounds a bit odd but it works.   I really like this place and will be back again for some Korean bakeries treats!"}
{"text":"Three choices always on the menu: red bean paste with walnut, mashed potato with walnut and red bean paste with almond. my Korean friend who introduced me to Hodo Kwaja only gets the original red bean with walnut.   Having had many Bungeoppang (red bean cake, really the same thing but fish-shaped, instead of walnut shaped) before in Hong Kong, Tokyo and Korea, I would say Hodo Kwaja measures up to expectations.   one word o advice though - you'd want to eat the cakes as soon as you buy them, they turn stale within 5 days. but that shouldn't be much of a problem...  a must-purchase for first time Koreatown explorers."}
{"text":"Ode to a K-town Staple  Picture this: it's a cold day in Toronto, you step off Bloor street in Koreatown and into the warmth of Hodo Kwaja. Venturing to the order counter through the long and narrow walkway, you're greeted by the mechanics of their walnut cake maker, busily moulding, filling and assembling little walnut shaped and palm sized cakes.   Once at the counter, you are presented with a display  of the finished walnut cakes, filled with mashed potatoes and walnut, mashed potatoes and almond or red bean.  Adacent to the display is a griddle, tucked away to your right, with pancakes, hotteoks, sizzling to perfection. Everything is hot and fresh, and you do the only sensible thing, you get everything---pancake and walnut cakes.   Because of the cold and because you're a sweet-toothed demon, you grab a seat in the back and bite into the pancake straightaway. Its texture is light, fluffy, everything a pancake should be. The next bites yield an overflow of hot molten brown sugar. Your tongue narrowly escapes, but your hand falls victim to the sweet lava, a worthwhile casualty. Besides, after the cold exterior, you don't mind too much, but proceed with caution to savour the hot sugar, cinnamon and sunflower seed filling. It's everything you knew it would be, it tastes like magic.   Pancake in one hand, you reach with your other hand into the paper bag filled with warm walnut cakes. The first you try is a mashed potatoes and nut filing, you can never quite tell the walnut and the almond apart, you probably eat them too quickly. The thin layer of cake has a toasted firmness and the filling is fine as sand, not too sweet without a discernable trace of potatoes. On the next draw, you pick red bean, which never happens on the second try, but you welcome the surprise.  By contrast, this little nugget packs a natural sweetness, you eat it slowly, gradually taking it in.   As you indulge quietly in the back of the buzzing establishment, something on the wall grabs your attention. You stare at the photograph of a bowl of shaved ice, loaded with toppings. You quickly make a mental note to come back in the summer---then you remember it's Canada. \"What the deuce,\" you tell yourself, \"I'll just come back next week.\""}
{"text":"Went to Korea Town looking for something to eat and stumbled upon a sign for hhoduk and hodo kwaja. We immediately walked in and was welcomed by a very friendly employee (shout-out to her - don't know her name ) and ordered 2 brown sugar hhoduks and a 6 variety pack of hodo kwajas. All of it was really great, but above all the staff was incredibly sweet."}
{"text":"Picked up some korean walnut cakes while I was in korea town. The staff was very friendly, she explained what the walnut cakes was and even asked if I had any food allergies before packing up the cake bites.... I couldn't even remember when the last time a server asked me if I had any food allergies at a bakery.  Very impressed.  I would suggest eating the walnut cakes with coffee. very good."}
{"text":"I have been going to Hodo Kwaja for years- I remember back when they had the green sign! If you want the best walnut cakes in the city, this is where to go. The employees take the time to talk to you and get to know you, and they're so nice! The madelines and walnut cakes are great with tea in the winter and the bingsu is delicious in the summer!"}
{"text":"Paid a visit to Hodo Kwaja to check out some Balls... Walnut cake balls that is. It's a small shop and they have the setup to make the balls right at the window. The lady at the counter was friendly and explained what was each flavour.  I was in after work so it was slim pickins but they still had the red bean and mashed potato so I got 3 of each at a flat $2.  Although these weren't fresh and warm, they were cheap, not too sweet and great as a small snack while walking around Koreatown figuring where to go for dinner.  3.5 stars Check them out if you're in the area!  I'll have to come back a bit earlier next time so I can stuff some Fresh Warm Balls in Mah Mouth... Ahem."}
{"text":"Yummy walnut cakes and brown sugar red bean pancakes (a little on the chewy side though). The staff is great and it smells amazing inside.  Great place to grab a quick snack for now or for later."}
{"text":"I came back and gave it a five because I just remembered how fresh they make them!"}
{"text":"On a cold wintry day, this is a very good place to go. The Korean pancakes are probably by far my favorite thing here. I love the brown sugar pancakes when they're hot and steamy. I don't live near Koreatown and would still make the trip over because they are THAT good.   The little walnut cakes are pretty good too. When they put it in a little bag, you're not sure which flavor you're eating (if you choose a mix of them) so each bite is a surprise.   I'd come again and eat the walnut cakes but what I'd make sure I have stomach space is ALWAYS and FOREVER the hotteok. Grocery stores sell the pancake mix for this (including the filling and all) but I can never squash the pancake to be as flat so they never are as satisfying to eat. Stop wavering (if you are) about coming or not, just go already ;)"}
{"text":"A small korean bakery that sells walnut cakes (hodo kwaja), korean brown sugar pancakes (hotteok), madeleine pastries, and much more!  Stopping by for some hot dessert on a cold winter day is the perfect time to eat these treats. The walnut cakes filled with red bean and hotteok really hit the spot and tasted just as authentic as the ones they sell at the street food markets in Korea.   If this was in my neighborhood, I'd come here everyday!"}
{"text":"Their walnut cakes are so good! The red bean one is definitely better than the mashed potato one in my opinion. Thanks yelp for guiding me here :)"}
{"text":"I love this place. My favorite is the red bean filled walnut cakes. For those who don't know what it is, imagine a tiny pancake pocket filled with a sweet paste. It's like $2.5 for six, and even cheaper if you get more. The best is when they're fresh and still hot!"}
{"text":"This is the heart of koreatown. I remember coming here as a young child, holding my grandpa's hand as he ordered the walnut cakes, in both red bean and walnut of course. Steaming warm, and so delicious, I enjoyed every morsel, and still do today.  The Korean Pancake is my guilty pleasure. I don't eat sweets but I literally cannot resist these, they have a gooey, maple-syrupy center, and steamy, chewy dough around it.  This place is more than just good food. It had a history, a loving family behind it and a lovely warm atmosphere."}
{"text":"Was walking around this area and came across this place. Caught me eye because you can see the people make these pastries behind a glass pane. They are known for their walnut cakes although they do have a few other pastries you can try. They have 3 different flavours so we just got an assortment to try all three flavours. The price for these is also really cheap. It was my first time trying the walnut cake and it wasn't anything too special. Its good for a small and cheap snack. They have a little sitting area at the back of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Great service! Really conversational and knowledgeable staff. We were first-timers and loved the brown sugar pancakes and the red bean walnut cakes!!"}
{"text":"Walnut cake heaven! The employee that helped me was efficient and friendly. They have raised their prices from last year: $10 for 30 walnut cakes which is still a good deal. Brought these to a party and they went fast."}
{"text":"Whenever I pass by I always pick up a dozen of mixed walnut cakes! Delicious for on the go and always a welcomed treat when they get home :) sometimes I'm intimidated to go into stores like this but as soon as you get in here you are greeted by staff and will be in and out quickly!"}
{"text":"Tried assorted hodo kwaja (red bean and walnut) along with a reheated sugar hoddeok. Between the 2 hodo kwajas my preference is for the red bean flavour. As a tip, they definitely taste better reheated! While the hodo kwaja was good though, it wasn't quite exceptional. I recall that the hodo kwajas I used to pick up at a small shop in new kennedy plaza (not sure if it still exists) was better and had a stronger red bean flavour. The hodo kwajas here really are just very sweet.  WRT the hoddeok, since it wasn't fresh (not the stores fault since they were almost closing), there wasn't really a crispy outside and chewy inside that I was hoping for. The dough part was basically just soft and chewy throughout with a gooey black sugar filling, that was a bit too sweet for my personal tastes.   Overall, this is a neat shop that I recommend if you want to try some korean sweet snacks. But not somewhere you have to go out of your way to try."}
{"text":"liked the Korean pancakes better than the walnut cakes. Pancakes are warm and the brown sugar melts when it's hot, Highly recommend the pancakes. In terms of the walnut cakes, I find them just okay, nothing like \"wow\" very cheap though"}
{"text":"Perfect walnut cake!! We love it ^^ we all do love it..tasty and not too sweet. We wish you will have more locations in the future!!"}
{"text":"Located at the heart of k-town on Bloor st. Near Christie station. Every time I'm in the area, I stop by to grab several small soft buns filled with red bead. Their Korean dessert like pancakes have inner fillings with brown sugar, nuts, and it's delicious when freshly made! they usually sell it freshly made!"}
{"text":"Went here on a whim once, and fell in love with the walnut cakes! I've been back several times since, and it always makes for a great dessert option whenever I'm in the area.  Next on my list: Gotta try the pat bingsu..."}
{"text":"Mmm... come here for.some inexpensive dessert! Really like their brown sugar pancake that goes for $1.75 each. Goes really well with a hot cup of tea. Their red bean pancake ($2 each) is pretty good too. Cute walnut cakes! Seating in the back though most people takeout."}
{"text":"This is the first time I had walnut cakes and I thought this place was delicious!  I have nothing to compare it to, but I really enjoyed all 3 flavours - red bean, potato almond and potato walnut.  Next time I will try their madelaines and pancakes."}
{"text":"I've never had walnut cakes before but DAM are these addicting. I'm wanting more as I'm typing this. The red bean ones are to die for!! Mix and match so you can find your favourite."}
{"text":"What a nice little hidden place this is.  Many do not know this but once upon a time, I used to really love sweets. Big on cheesecakes, pies, cakes, small pastries... although never about cookies. They are soulless, buttered treats that are meant to kill you. :-P  Anyway, I stopped eating sweets a few years ago, in fact I just recently had a chocolate bar after... Wow, almost 5 years. Damn you Halloween induced peer pressure!   I digress, this little spot in Korean town is fairly unique as nowhere else in town can you get these tasty little pastries filled delicious walnut, red bean or potato filling.    Personally I have tried them all and the red bean, is not my favourite as I rather prefer the other flavours, the walnut is my favourite and the potato is alright. When I go I mostly get the walnut filled ones.   They also sell Korean flat pancakes which is not anything like its savory Japanese cousin but if you do get it, eat them warm. Just like pastries, they really do shine when fresh and loose a little bit of their luster as they cool. I have noticed they make the snacks throughout the day and late afternoon, the pancakes seems like they make them constantly.     They do not have a lot of space so if you want to snack in, well, just be aware they are short on space, and tables and chairs. Personally I pick to go.  The owner is very friendly and during my first time there, I mentioned that I would be back and asked at what time they close, at which point she gave me her card and said: \"We close at 10:00pm but if you are coming, just call in and I will keep the store open.\" I am sure she meant within reason but that is insanely good customer service to have even offered. The type I have seen in other parts of the world but hardly ever here. You can feel that she enjoys what she does.   On that alone she has a new customer in me, not to mention they are great snacks. Check them out."}
{"text":"Headline: TASTE MY KOREAN BALLS  *400th review!*  I always want my hallmark reviews to be a great place.  This is one of them. Why?  Because it is unique: Nowhere else in town can you get these tasty little pastries with delicious walnut, red bean or potato filling.  I LOVE the red bean, the walnut next and the potato is a distant third.  but I love coming in here and getting a mixed batch JUST because the excitement of GUESSING which you will get is much more fun than guranteeing yourself your favourite flavour : )  Not many people also know that they sell the flat pancake that, if you get- only eat it warm.  BEST bought right off the grill because there is a caramelly layer in the middle that is FANTASTIC and oozes out (not in a messy uncontrollable- you'll be sticky all-over kind of way but) in a delicious way.  Best is to buy it on a cold winter day and smush your hands on each side of the pancake while you nibble on it to keep you warm and eat something tasty.  This is probably one of my favaourite places to pickup stuff for potlucks, meetings or even grab dessert after a date.   so much fun! NOT ONLY THAT, but watching them make the cakes/ korean balls are also uber fun.  proTip: If you don't buy them fresh wait until you get home so you can put them in a toaster oven.  They taste best with the fresh crispy outside and the soft warm center.  enjoy!"}
{"text":"Was around the area today with my mom so I brought her here and we tried the mini red bean chestnut cakes. We asked upon purchase if they could heat it up for us and the employee said she could microwave it but advised that if she did, we should eat all of them in one sitting. When she gave it back to us, they were only barely warm to touch so ehh, it only tasted alright. The red bean filling was a bit too sweet but overall, it was mediocre.  However, being the rebels we are, we didn't listen to her and only ate 3/6, bringing the leftovers home. Roughly 10 hours later, I reheated them with a toaster oven and it tasted so much better!! The filling paste was finely grinded into a smooth texture and the cake was hot and crunchy! I would definitely recommend that you only eat these when they're hot."}
{"text":"First time we came they were out of hotteok. Worker was really nice and said they didn't expect they would have such high demand that day, so this instance was unusual. Next day we came and thankfully even after 8PM they were stocked.   This was my first hotteok and I really liked it. The pancake was chewy and delicious on its own, even better with the gooey brown sugar filling. Not too sweet either. Must try while in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Bought 30 for $9 including tax with mixed walnut cake flavours. Delicious as usual and quick service as well."}
{"text":"I love this place! I usually come for walnut cakes or their pancakes. Everything is always nice and fresh. Their staff is super nice. I believe the daughter of the owners in particular is always so friendly and full of info, she'll always happily explain what all the items. Also if you've never had walnut cakes before, don't be turned off by the description of a mashed potato filling. When it is combined with the nuts and sweetened, it tastes a bit like chestnut. I usually get a box of all three flavours, all mixed and one of each of their pancakes. Their one with nuts and seeds and brown sugar has a unique flavour so if you were to only have one, I recommend that one. In the summer they also have patbingsu, Korean shaved ice. I tried their injeolmi flavour and it was good but I think next time I will ask for it to be a bit more sweet. Their fresh fruit one looks good too. Btw, their prices are so cheap! It's really good value. They have a little bit of sitting in a casual cafe style setting. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars. Decent and cheap walnut cakes. Had the chestnut tasting one. Was ok, wouldn't repeat unless I was in the area. Wish they had custard."}
{"text":"Hodo Kwaja seems to garner a lot of foot traffic. Perhaps it's because Toronto does not have many places that offer the same kind of sweets/pastries that Hodo Kwaja has. The walnut cakes and hoduk are a popular Korean snack/dessert, and this place does a decent job making them."}
{"text":"Review on the Run:  I've managed to convert a few of my \"gringo\" friends as Claudia puts it to the power of the red bean.  At first, the concept of a bean in dessert was disturbing to them.  Maybe it's the marketing?  We need to rename the redbean.. maybe to something like velvet-choco-paste?    Anyways, these little Korean Timbits are awesome.  If I could only get them at Timmys as well I'd be set.  I could have some dutchies and redbean timbits.  I can't, so this is the next best place.  Conclusion: Eat Here?  Yup!"}
{"text":"I physically can't walk by without getting a box of 30 walnut cakes ($9). In fact I've been doing so for many years. And only last night (walked by; got a box of 30) did someone point out to me that they are in the shape of walnuts. Wow. I never noticed because they go directly from the box into my mouth. Or sometimes, from box into microwave into mouth.  An excellent alternative to bringing a box of Timbits somewhere!"}
{"text":"yummy walnut cakes! when i came they had the red bean and mashed potato walnut cakes. the red bean ones were cold and a little soft which was kinda disappointing. the mashed potato ones were great tho :) i found both slightly sweet though."}
{"text":"One of my many favourite places to visit when I'm in Korean Town at Christie and Bloor.  The Korean-equivalent of Timbits, but packed with loads more flavour and all around goodness.    My favourite is the red-bean Korean walnut cake.  It is quite the experience as you get to watch the assembly line of walnut cakes made reminscent of a Krispy Kreme doughnut shop when you used to be able to watch the doughnuts being made, however, there are no free samples here :p  They also have sweet-potato walnut cakes as well as green-bean walnut cakes, but the red-bean ones are my pick!  Another item that I always order are the Korean \"pancakes\" which has an exterior that appears to be made of glutinous rice flour.  It comes in 2 flavours, brown sugar and red bean.  Since I always get the walnut cakes in red-bean flavour, I opt for the brown sugar filling.  Always yummy.  I always go early in the morning because I like to eat everything fresh off the assembly line!"}
{"text":"This place took me back to my childhood in Seoul eating the walnut cookies and sweet pancakes made by street vendors.  They taste totally authentic and delicious.  Good thing I don't live in Toronto or I would eat dozens of them every week, I miss it already!"}
{"text":"One of the must hit places in dt K-town (bloor and christie)! Have been coming here since middle school and their walnut cakes are always served fresh! Walnut cakes come in 3 traditional flavours: red-bean, mashed potato with walnut, and mashed potato with almonds. You can ask the server to separate and mark the flavours if you are buying assorted. Fairly fast service with friendly servers that can speak fluent English. The owners should seriously consider expanding its store operations."}
{"text":"This made my late snack last night and a breakfast this morning. Yes, I like it that much! First time I tried the smashed potato flavor and it tasted good ( feel bad for my friend, didn't get the luck to get even one smashed potato flavor, eating red bean for the whole night).   Good with tea, latte, and Korean soap operas."}
{"text":"A Korea Town staple! I'm a former Annexer who laments that fact that I don't get to walk past Hodo Kwaja randomly to buy treats whenever I have a hankering.   That said, I still make the pilgrimmage when I'm in the area. I love the red bean flavour but I'm partial to the mashed potato with almonds, which adds an interesting sweet and lightly nutty flavour to the mix.   I love sweets, but I'm also attracted to savoury baked goods (probably my Eastern European heritage) so these adorable treats really hit the spot. If you've never been? Stop by and try it out :)  Also, the staff here are always so friendly, and last night when I went by after a rainstorm, we ordered 30 and we were actually given almost 40, a 'rainy day bonus'! (That's when I realized I've done a disservice by never writing a review of this wonderful bakery!)"}
{"text":"So many walnuts! Wait...wha? No it's walnut CAKE!  I was just eating dinner nearby this place when I saw the molds and signs of cake from the window display. Uh cake? YAH, count me in. The walnut looking things are called hodo kwaja in Korean. They have fillings of potato and red bean. I was already sold at cake, and red bean so my boyfriend and I ordered 6 for I believe 2.75. Not bad! Then again, these babies are pretty small. I loved the softness of it and the filling. I recommend ordering a batch because they are addictive and I could probably stuff my face with 3-4 at a time.   Anyways, cute place. Highly recommend coming here for dessert after dinner or something in Koreatown."}
{"text":"I visited this place a week ago, and I was picking up 7 box of 30 walnut cookies for my friends.  I called in advance and asked for mix of redbean walnut and potato almond cookies in each box.  The owner was there and he is a very nice and friendly guy, and the store is clean and I enjoyed seeing them making fresh cookies and sweet pancakes at the front of the shop.  For the flavor goes, my friends and I love them!  I was a little skeptical about the potato filling, but it is delicious, I like it even more than the usual redbean filling.  It is less sweet than redbean paste and textute is great.  I also had brown sugar pancake, and it was tasty too.  The dough is chewy and soft.  Delicious!!"}
{"text":"Cute little spot! The staff was friendly and the food was comforting with the cold weather! We tried different pastries, and our favourite was definitely the brown sugar pancake! Would go back!"}
{"text":"One of the most delightful things about living near this strip of Bloor is this little gem right here. I'd never heard of nor tasted walnut cakes before! The staff were so amused by my amusement that they gave me samples to try and watched as my chew turned into a grin and I ordered a mix of six with my mouth full. This place is simply charming."}
{"text":"My memories of Walnut Cake was from a Korean man at Pacific Mall many years ago.  SECOND floor he had a small stall situated beside clothing stores, bubble tea shops, and snack shops.  He stood out from all others because of his background and his unique offering much like how Belgian Waffles is now the attraction at Pacific Mall.  He was the guy that gave me the first taste of this tasty snack and I wish to THANK him for that.  He always had a friendly personality, great smile and offered HOT & FRESH Walnut Cakes upon every order.  He did have problems with his machine from time to time but you can always see him hard at work fixing it with a smile.  Coming to Hodo Kwaja reminds me of how much I really MISS him.  I wish I didn't have such long-term photographic memories, which make me depress.  Nonetheless thanks for the great memories, Mister!  Hodo Kwaja here offers the same product however getting here on a Sunday evening the place was QUIET with no sounds of sweet Walnut Cake machinery to be heard.  We got the Potato Walnut Cake as well as Red Bean Walnut Cake which were all placed in the display case awaiting for future patrons.  The ingredients and composition were all the same as my previous experiences however not being in a WARM state it really lacked the smell and addictiveness that normally gives me the sweetest dreams at night.  I'm sorry to say I have to give this a 2 *Star* however being the only other place I've had this in the GTA, I will offer 1 more *Star* bringing it to a total of 3 *Stars*."}
{"text":"Order: Mixed Box of every flavor (Red Bean w/Walnut, Mashed Potato w/Walnut, and Red Bean w/Almond)  This hole-in-the-wall attracts a lot of it's attention with it's very own walnut cake making contraption (apparently costing them $30,000 to ship directly from Korea).  For that much monies the cakes had better be amazing!  And in short they are!  The consistency and flavor in each cake delivers and are dangerously addictive.  Eat right away and with a cup of tea of coffee for the best experience!  [Pros] + cheap cheap cheap; treat yourself to a few or buy a lot and share with friends! + there are 3 different types - each tastes great (my favorite was the mashed potato with walnut)"}
{"text":"On the way home from an evening band rehearsal, my beautiful girlfriend convinced me (disclaimer: it takes next to nothing to convince me to try new food, but still...it was late-ish and I was sleepy) to stop in here to try my first walnut ball.  We ordered 30 balls (we got 31! and the ball-cook at the counter was more than happy to explain the intricacies of the walnut balls to my GF while we waited) of the mixed variety (red bean, walnut, potato) and I was not disappointed.   Delicious cold on the walk home, warmed in the microwave, and again the next day in the toaster oven for lunch, these Hodo Kwaja are an absolute delight, and I'm having a hard time sitting here knowing that there's 5 more sitting in the fridge, waiting to be devoured. I'm imagining them in there yelling \"eat me!\" inside the tupperware, and then after a few minutes of not being eaten, they then start plotting ways to escape the tupperware, bounce off the floor, and roll their way over to my cubicle; Jumping up and down on their arrival, singing \"Don't You Forget About Us\" to the tune of the similarly titled Simple Minds song in high pitched voices that you would imagine tiny walnut cakes would have. \"Hey cakes!\" I'd say \"Be patient! I won't forget to eat you!\" but they won't leave me alone, so you know what...I'm just going to go to the fridge right now and eat the rest."}
{"text":"Who would have thought someone could pay their bills by selling three flavored walnut-shaped (and sized) cakes almost exclusively?  These tiny balls of joy are are filled with various internal cake delicacies (red bean, almond, walnut).  I haven't felt balls this smooth since i massaged my botoxed nut sack.  Wash it down with a Lotte Sac Sac Orange Drink and you're good to go!  A TOONIE & A LOONIE RECOMMENDATION: 12 walnut cakes for $3.  Them shits will eat like a meal (recommended for non-continuous consumption only)."}
{"text":"Shared shaved ice with fruits with a friend here recently. Compared to other shaved ice I've had elsewhere, the one here is just \"A-OK\" as the rating says. The ice was actually kind of rough and had chunks of ice. Shaved ice should feel more like snow than crushed ice. Some pieces of fruits were still frozen and hard to chew on.  The walnut cakes were delicious, would eat again! Soft and warm and Mmm! Also enjoyed the sugar pancake.   I recommend this place for the pastries but not the shaved ice."}
{"text":"ASIAN DESSERTS? ANYDAY, ANYTIME, ANYWHERE (within reason, of course).  I absolutely adore asian desserts, what other types of desserts will ever cater to my tastebuds? I often find most desserts far too sweet for my asian tastebuds, which is why I just devour asian sweets regularly (known to be substantially less sweet than others).   This place is definitely quite the hidden gem, I could walk past it easily if I was not looking for it in particular. The place is quite small itself as well, the door way is quite small and there is seating inside but not a whole lot! Just enough.   I really wanted to try the pancakes, but I was just way too full after dinner to be able to gorge myself on starch and sugar. For $1.75 for a pancake, that was a really tantalizing offer I just had to unwillingly give up for the sake of my stomach. However, I was able to try the biscuits and Walnut cakes that they had (WOOHOO!).   They let me sample the biscuits, which came in seaweed, almond, and regular flavour. It sort of reminded me of pizzelle and your typical asian sweet egg roll, nothing special in particular. It was really nice, though. Upon hearing the hype about the Walnut cakes, I just had to try them for myself. I tried all three flavours, but I think I found the almond the tastiest. I think I missed out quite a bit on trying them warm and freshly made, since mine were a bit stale and cold from the trek from downtown to uptown, LOL. I thought I would like the red bean the most, but surprisingly I preferred the almond. The red bean tastes nice, although I think the filling could be more smooth and a little less sweet. The almond one is really nice however, the filling was incredibly smooth and just the perfect amount of sweetness. I can't really remember any distinct difference between the Walnut and Almond flavour, but there was a distinct texture difference between those two. The almond was much smoother.   Overall, I will definitely be returning if I'm ever in the area for Walnut cakes and a pancake! Hopefully, I'll also have a chance to come in on a lighter stomach so I could try their desserts as well. Also, the Walnut cakes are priced very reasonably, $2.00/6 pcs. and $8.00/30 pcs. They come with a very generous amount of filling, totally worth it. I am super excited for my next visit, SWEET!"}
{"text":"Wouldn't give this place more than a 3. They have interesting and authentic korean desserts that are pretty cheap. I found the walnut cakes the same as the one at T&T, and I didn't know that their shaved ice cream is actually shaved ice (sherbet)... i thought it was the layered folded ice cream :O overall, snacks are alright"}
{"text":"Tasty and delicious I keep coming back for the walnut cakes. The staff are extremely friendly and I absolutely love the walnut cakes. I also tried the red bean sherbet which was okay but I am not usually a fan of shaved ice. Whenever I am in koreatown, I always have to make a stop at Hodo Kwaja before I leave."}
{"text":"So delicious! I come here daily because I can't resist the red bean walnuts hodo kwaja!"}
{"text":"I love stopping by this place to get walnut cakes to take back home in Oakville. They're still good after they've been lugged in my bag while I explored the city. I like all  three flavours of walnut, almond, and red bean. This time, I got their famous brown sugar and peanut Korean pancake. Nice and warm taken from the grill."}
{"text":"This place is my favourite place for brown sugar pancakes and of course there walnut cakes. Whenever I pass by the area it's a must for me to buy a box or two for the family. The service is good as well, they are very helpful."}
{"text":"Mix of 12 red bean walnut cakes and 1 brown sugar pancake came to $7.  I came at the end of the day, 5 minutes before closing. I'm sure these would be amazing fresh out of the oven but when I had them they were almost soggy and not the best. I popped them in the oven once I got home though and what a big difference it made to have these warm and slightly crispy!  The almond walnut cake was a little bland for my liking. The red bean one is good if you are lucky enough to get a (tiny) piece of walnut in the cake. Of the 8 red bean ones that I've had so far, only 3 had a walnut piece in them. It's too bad that not all the cakes have a walnut piece in them becuase it really enhances the flavour of the cake.  The pancake was very tasty! (Put in the toaster to heat before serving.) It had that nice texture and taste of yeast-based bread. It wasn't too sweet which was nice. I'd love to try the red bean pancake sometime (They were sold out).  I definitely enjoyed the pancake more than the walnut cakes. Would certainly go back for pancakes; Walnut cakes too but only if they are fresh, which I'm sure they will be as long as you don't come 5 minutes before closing (9:55 PM)."}
{"text":"This was nothing like what I expected, but it was great! These little walnut shaped walnut cakes are really savoury and cute. I sampled all three flavors, but I think I prefer the red bean. It had the most interesting taste.  This place is relaxed and cool. I really need to go back during the day when they have the machine on and are actually making the walnut cakes. That looks cool!  It's so cheap and the cakes are bite-sized, so get a lot and share with friends! That's what I plan to do next."}
{"text":"Found this little place while walking through Koreatown and am I glad I did! The people are really nice and friendly! I got the red bean pancake (hodddeok) and it was made fresh and was so hot and yummy!  Will definately come back to try their famous little walnut pastry and the patbingsu!"}
{"text":"The most delicious walnut cakes EVER!! Although I didn't get super fresh ones, i came in abit before they were closing. The cashier lady was super super friendly and let us sample some flavours before trying. Since they weren't super fresh (just fresh out of the oven) she gave us a deal for like 15 pieces for $5 or so. We only had the choices of red bean and potato so I ordered half and half. AND MY GODDD, THE POTATO ONE IS DELICIOUS. ITS A MUST TRY. It may sound disgusting or weird but seriously, i looks it more than their homemade red bean (delicious too tho)!  Definitely coming back to try super fresh ones out of the oven!!"}
{"text":"Came here late afternoon.  It was pretty filled but our orders of walnut cakes came immediately and they were still really warm.  We tried all 3 flavours, and we were delighted that the store owner let us mix-and-match our 3 different flavours!  The mashed potato ones sound weird, but rest assured, they are still pretty good. I'd go for just the original (red bean ones) next time though!  It is pretty hidden though, so make sure you keep an eye out for it."}
{"text":"Great authentic patbingsu! (red bean shaved ice) The ideal place for dessert after you've had a meal in Koreatown. Took a while, so the waitress made our papingsu extra big. Tasted just like one you can get in Korea. Great for a hot summer day. Their hodo kwaja's also looked pretty good!"}
{"text":"Get the walnuts when you see people making them on the little conveyor line thIng. Get the pancakes all other times. Remember:   walnuts+conveyor= yes, always yes.  walnuts+no conveyor= get the pancakes. if you are intoxicated= GET EVERYTHING. DO NOT DISCRIMINATE BASED ON CONVEYOR FUNCTIONALITY. YOU'RE WELCOME."}
{"text":"This place is located in Koreatown and is the perfect place to go to when you are craving a snack. You could continuosly snack on these if you really wanted to.  The hodokwaja, walnut shaped caked, are filled with red bean. Along with hodokwaja, they serve a variety of other desserts such as pancakes, madeleines, and chun byung. We opted to get a 30 pack of the traditional red bean filling w/ walnuts as well as mashed potato w/ almonds! Luckily for us, the lady was kind enough to give us fresh ones. The insides were good and warm. Both the red beans and the mashed potatoes were creamy in the inside and were not overly sweet or savoury. On top of this, the pricing is cheap; it is definately worth it if you buy in huge batches. We devoured it quick and would definitely come again!  Service wise, the place had a friendly atmosphere, pretty cosy. The employees there treat you kindly even when you cannot speak Korean."}
{"text":"I only had the Red Bean Walnut Cake here and I wish I could have more next time! Red bean is always my favourite ingredient for making desserts. And this one is both delicious whether you eat them as soon as it is cooked out of the stove or after getting it frozen.  And the restaurant is quite small but gives a comfortable atmosphere as some old ladies sitting there and shooting the breeze.   Next time I'll try more food there!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and love the fried cookies. It's seasonal item and they stop making them when the weather warms up because they get soggy. Flavours include Seaweed, almond, and peanut. A big variety box is around $10. Of course the other stuff is great too since Red bean filling is my fav."}
{"text":"awesome.. I love the walnut especially, red bean I don't like. Staff is fast and friendly. Great treat, fun to watch them made. Love it."}
{"text":"Delicious! While living in Korea, I didn't like the brown sugar pancakes that much. I decided to come here since I heard so much about the place. I bought one to eat in the store and it was wonderful! It had the right amount of filling and it wasn't so hot that it would burn your mouth.  It was so good I ordered a pack of five to go! I was also skeptical about ordering the Walnut cakes as I was told they have a Chestnut flavor( and im not a fan of chestnuts). I ended up getting aix of the three flavors and It was surprisingly good, not as much as I enjoyed the pancakes, but I would definitely buy those Walnut cakes again. Just wish I bought even more pancakes!!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try out the famous brown sugar pancake and walnut cakes. I got 10 of each of the walnut cake filling that they have. So good!!! Love the brown sugar pancake even more!! It was cold today so I didn't want to try the red bean sherbet but next time for sure. Maybe tomorrow! ^.^"}
{"text":"After months of lusting after the Korean Pancakes since I've moved to Koreatown from Parkdale, I finally had one. The brown sugar one. I'll probably be having many more of these delights until I move out of this temporary apartment. They are warm, and might squirt you with their delicious brown sugar juices. I've also tried the walnut cakes, which are good too, but I'm privy to the pancakes."}
{"text":"Stopped by here after a very satisfying lunch in Koreatown and I was not disappointed! I got the walnut cake with the red bean filling and I was so pleasantly surprised when I realized these treats were not overly sweet! I often find that most red bean treats are very sweet, but these were just right. They are delicious when warm so make sure you heat them up before eating!"}
{"text":"I come here often for Walnut cakes! 6 little delicious balls for $2! My fave are the potato and walnut, and potato and almond cakes. Walnut cakes with roasted green tea Korean style - you can't go wrong! Total: less than $4! Great snack and totally different from timbits.   Run by a sweet Korean family!"}
{"text":"The name of the shop translates literally into walnut cake, and that's what we came here for...plus the hotcakes, which weren't available...bugger! We came here on our last day in Toronto soon after they opened, and there was no action banking and pressing at this point. We were told that they don't start making the hotcakes until 11:30am (?), and they only had leftover walnut cakes from the day before, which left us no choice but to grab a few of those for the road. The cakes were still fine and lasted more than 2 days, but it obviously wasn't the knockout experience I'd anticipated. Maybe next time?"}
{"text":"I was in Koreatown exploring the area. My sweet tooth accidentally bumped into Hodo Kwaja and it didn't steer me wrong. I was new to Korean desserts and the staff did a wonderful job of patiently explaining everything. I decided to order an assortment of the walnut cakes. Best decision ever! They were delicious and I want to return for the pancakes. The price is very affordable. In addition to the walnut cakes I ordered Korean iced coffee. They kindly let me taste the coffee before purchasing. It was great, I like my coffee black. Overall great experience!"}
{"text":"This was my first experience trying korean treats.  SO, having said that, this place is good!   There is some seating at the back for a few small groups... the place is small and tight and the line can get kind of long. But they attend to you quickly and get the line moving.  The main options are korean pancake, the sherbets, walnut cake, madeleines, and chun byung.   The walnut cake and brown sugar pancake was delicious!  Red bean sherbet was not my cup of tea, but my friend really liked it!   To get your craving fix, this is a nice place!"}
{"text":"I LOVE HODO KWAJA!  These korean timbits (is it a blasphemy to compare the two?!) are a perfect sweet snack. Combines soft dough with a smooth filling and a crunchy walnut here and there. The lady at the counter always fills a little extra one or two for me - super nice.  I get some every time I'm in koreatown - if you're close by make it a trip!"}
{"text":"I adore this place. Hands down, the best place to get the walnut cakes and korean red bean pancakes. I think I'll be going there more often once it gets cold.  I wasn't there when the machines were running, but the walnut cakes were fantastic. They offer 3 flavours (red bean, walnut, almond) for their walnut cakes. They also have the red bean or brown sugar pancakes. I personally like to get the walnut cakes to go, and you can walk along the street while snacking on these goodies. I would eat the pancakes in the store, they taste fantastic when they are warm. I found that the brown sugar pancake to be too sweet for my liking, but if you have a sweet tooth then I would try it."}
{"text":"Came by here for the first time and bought 12 walnut cakes for $4.50. The server was especially kind and suggested I'd get an assortment of the 3 flavours as I was a first timer here-- red bean walnut, mashed potato walnut and mashed potato almond. It was soft and delicious. I will most definitely be coming back for their other items on the menu!   They only accept cash under $10."}
{"text":"Thought coming earlier (~11am) would mean fresh walnut cakes but they gave us yesterday's ones instead.. Perk is that they gave us 2-3 extra for free but they weren't warm and toasty like I would have liked them :("}
{"text":"Alas, though I did enjoy the walnut cakes immensely, I did not enjoy the cockroach crawling on the wall beside me as I sat and chatted with fellow Yelpers while enjoying said walnut cakes. I'm sure the cockroach came from the much shadier place next door as Hodo Kwaja is well maintained and a very clean place, yet I still think something must be said."}
{"text":"I tell myself I should try some of their other delicious looking offerings but I find myself ordering their walnut cakes anyways. You can't go wrong with 6 cakes (so you can get two of each flavor) for only $2.75. The cake is soft and the inside is packed with a good amount of filling. They are not overly sweet so you can finish most of them before you even notice how addictive they are!! Perfect for a snack or post-meal dessert."}
{"text":"i freakin love this place! at first i didn't like the taste of red bean but our group of friends kept going there to hang out and stuff so i guess my tastebuds got around to it haha. it's also pretty cheap, $2 for 6 walnut cakes. the potato flavoured one is a must try if you're starting out, unless you're allergic to almond and the brown sugar pancake is sooososo yummy when you got a major sweet tooth like i do ;) however, it does tend to get very messy. no matter what, do not eat it on the go! make yourself at home at the tables and slowly savour every bite. trust me you are bound to ruin your clothes. boy oh boy... i've made that mistake more than 3 times lol. i didn't realize that they had a bathroom way down in the basement that's kind of hidden sooo there's another tip! The owner and staff of 3 are also very nice and friendly. i was joking around with the owner before saying how i'd like to work there someday cause the walnut cake making machine was so cool. and also, one day upon leaving, i realized that i had left my scarf at the store so i decided to visit all the way back to see if they found it. the lady remembered me since i was a regular :) overall i think that hodo kwaja has a calm and cozy atmosphere to chill out in the winter to drink hot chocolate (which i haven't tried but according to my friend it's good) and enjoy the warm walnut cakes."}
{"text":"The red bean walnut cakes are a 10/10. If you eat them fresh? 11/10. Must try if you're visiting TO!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this bakery for years! The quality has never changed, and the service has always been warm and friendly! They're a local mom and pop owned bakery that specializes in walnut cakes (hodo kwaja), along with other baked goods such as pancakes and madeleines.  I highly recommend the brown sugar pancakes especially on a cold day as they're best served warm where the sugar oozes out :)  If you're in koreatown make sure you give them a try! You won't be disappointed!   Oh, they also have bing soo!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool. They make nice walnut snacks with brown sugar and red bean filling. You can buy them in packs as small as 6, and can even get them assorted. They have a nice walnut shape texture and I like them more than the pancakes, which are quite heavy and filling.  Also, they has patbingsoo for the summer~~ Bring a friend or date... its big!"}
{"text":"Oh my god, I can't believe Hodo Kwaja have fresh hokkeo here! These were one of my favourite Korean street snacks while I was visiting S. Korea. Could not get enough of them while I was there.   We got a fresh caramel hokkeo (Japanese pancakes). So hot and delicious. AND best part - only $1.50! Really wanted to try the desserts, they looked so good."}
{"text":"YAY best place to get walnut cakes sugar pancakes seaweed and almond cookies (which i didn't know about until yesterday, but they are delicious and go so well with tea)  plus the staff is super adorable and sweet and they're open all the way until 10!"}
{"text":"I love walnut cakes! I had them in H mart a few years ago and I've fallen in love with them ever since. They have the texture of taiyaki, but molded into bite-sized bits with a cute walnut shape and stuffed full of paste. There's also a secret nut inside.   We arrived when they just opened, so they didn't have any red bean walnut cakes. So sad. Fortunately their other two flavors, mashed potato + almond/walnut were available. They're pretty cheaply priced, so we got a pack of 12 for $4.50! What a steal!  They pick them up by the handful from a big tray of freshly made walnut cakes. The people working inside are lovely and didn't rush us (even though we took forever to decide what to eat.) I haven't tried the other desserts yet but I'm pretty excited to eat them next time!"}
{"text":"Their chun byung is so delicious. I was told it's only available seasonally so make sure to call/ask before going. I had one and somehow the entire box went into my stomach!! It was so delicious. Who would have thought seaweed with cookies would be good? I also had the Korean madeleines. I love Madeleines, they were very soft! I would definitely purchase these again and will be trying their walnut goods next time"}
{"text":"Came by on a Tuesday after a haircut for some evening snacks. The Korean pancake with brown sugar and peanut tastes really good when it comes off the hot plate. Super hot so need to be careful taking that first bite! Also bought a pack of their waffle cookies with sliced almonds and peanut pieces in them - simple and yummy cookies. The owner who greeted us said they only make the waffle cookies during the autumn - spring months. Will definitely be back for more Korean pancakes - nice and toasty warm brown sugar filling in chilly spring weather."}
{"text":"I love this place to bits! I once came here when it was pouring rain (sans umbrella) and was soaked. That's how good the walnut cakes are.  The friendly people who work here always greet me warmly and are very kind.   The red bean walnut cakes are my favorite out of the three fillings. I always pick up a box of 70 to share with family. Skip the madelines though- they are nothing special and tiny."}
{"text":"Wow, such an authentic Korean snack joint. They serve a selection of freshly made walnut cakes and Korean pancakes.  The flavours are amazing and taste just like how I remember them in Korea. The prices are very reasonable and they have some shaved ice and other desserts as well.  The service was friendly and they have a cool walnut cake machine that's neat to see as well.  Photos are encouraged but just not of the staff.  Not a fancy interior but it's worth it for a quick delicious snack on a cold day!"}
{"text":"After a coworker brought in a big box of these awesome \"Korean donuts\" one day, I had to hunt this place down.  Now whenever I'm in the area I stop by and pick up 30 of these Walnut cakes (red bean ftw).   The small tim-bit style donuts/cakes are extremely addictive. It's better to buy in small amounts if you lack self-control."}
{"text":"Been here quite a few times to purchase their walnut cakes. They are perfect little snacks for on the go! They are quite affordable for the amount you get. Would definitely come back for more!"}
{"text":"Random stop in from seeing people walk into here. Walnut cakes are super tasty and are different dessert/breakfast snack."}
{"text":"If you stroll along this part of Bloor St. only once in your life you have to stop here. Pick up a half-dozen bag of assorted cakes, or more if you plan to share, and enjoy. Great comfort food!"}
{"text":"Wandering around Koreatown trying to decide where to eat ... the most amazing aroma enveloped us ... Hodo Kwaja in production mode.  Fabulous walnut cakes being made right now!  and the brown sugar pancakes mmmmm ... total swoon time.  Bought a box of 30 hokkeo - mixed - each one delicious so far.  Like the best little filled waffle morsols ever.   And the pancake? super fantastic.   Since I only ordered one, mom behind the counter made one fresh for me.    It made a great appetizer for the pad thai I ended up getting next door.  Great quality - fresh made them behind perfect!   Try them - you'd be silly not to."}
{"text":"Super small store here. I was expecting more choices than the walnut cake balls they were selling in the front. They tasted great but I couldn't tell the different flavours after they were all mixed up in a bag. I got 3 different flavours and they all ended up tasting exactly the same.   Would really appreciate if they had more english up instead of Korean dominating it."}
{"text":"These are sweet buns with various fillings. If you are the kind who doesnot mind non trying out different and peculiar flavours, you would love this place"}
{"text":"Sometimes in quiet moments of reflection, I ponder what would happen if I ever moved away from Toronto. And then I have a panic attack as I contemplate the reality of a life lived without Hodo Kwaja's amazing walnut cakes!   No word of a lie, these unique little delicacies are at the top of the list of things I would miss about this city! I would pay good money to have them shipped to me wherever I am.   Honestly, I am so in love with these walnut cakes. Every time I am anywhere near Koreatown, I stop for them. They are basically little balls shaped like walnuts, and they come with 3 different types of filling: mashed potato with walnut, mashed potato with almond, and red bean with walnut. My favourite one is the potato with walnut. (I'm thinking the potato filling is not quite traditionally Korean. I think it's made for Canadian tastes, and that the potato filling is something unique to this location.)   The price has gone up a bit lately. $2.25 for 6 walnut cakes, and $9 for 30. But it's okay. Just go ahead and get 30! Co-workers love when you bring these in to share. It's something different from timbits! Or, you know, you could just go ahead and eat all 30 yourself...in one sitting..."}
{"text":"I had not been there in years.  Got a warm welcome from the owners who we have known for decades.  Nice family who still have the same high standards as before.   They make the BEST Korean hotteok (not hotdog, folks), HOTTEOK, which is a Korean fluffy pancake stuffed with sweet, red bean paste.  It is kind of like the Japanese hot-cakes made on the griddle, but stuffed with smooth and luscious red bean paste.  Very decadent and they have the little stuffed walnut and red bean cakes as well.  This is, without a doubt, in my estimation, the best Korean bakery in Toronto (Ontario) as a whole.  The owners are also nice and welcoming and take pride in their product.  Thank you for providing us with such a fantastic product, true to tradition and taste (and quality)."}
{"text":"After a soup feast over at Buk Chang Dong the only logical thing to do is go for walnut cakes at Hodo Kwaja. A buck and a half gets you six timbit sized walnut cakes or you can pick up 32 for $7. For a group of 7 people we got a box of 32 cakes in assorted flavours.  The fillings are either red bean or potato and some come with walnuts in them. My only complaint is that there's no way to tell the difference between the flavours from the outside. I wasn't big on the red bean but loved the potato and I had no way to tell what I was eating until it was too late. Next time I'd get the different flavours in different boxes.  Also, I was totally intrigued by the machine used to make the walnut cakes. I love old-school looking machinery like this."}
{"text":"Didn't want to go home right away after a big meal, my friend and I decided to find a place for dessert that is closest to us. We found this place on YELP (thank you Yelpers!)  The shop was so small! (1st impression). I stepped in and I asked my friend if they really bake some cakes here because I didn't smell any cakes (you know the smell of flour and butter and stuffs? - 2nd impression). After being introduced to all the cakes they have, we decided to get walnut cakes. I was shocked when I looked at the price (3rd impression). $2.25 for 6 hell yeah! So I got 2 of each (walnut with red bean, walnut with mashed potato, and almonds with mashed potato)  Service is fast, and the staff is very friendly. She introduced their products quickly and briefly. The owner is very funny. I overheard him talking to another customer. He kept saying that his business has been here for 15 years and they should trust their cakes. I  was convinced by that along with the cheap price to buy their walnut cakes.   The walnut cakes were okay for me. I like them, just won't be a fan of them. They were filled and not very sweet. But they were a bit cold. If they gave me warmer and fresher ones, I may like those cakes better.  Interesting desserts for a good, reasonable price tho!!  We were too full to try anything else but I would love to come back here for their pancakes with both brown sugar and red bean filling. They look so pretty dang good!"}
{"text":"Cheap and delicious! We got both the red bean and the potato/chestnut flavored walnut cakes. Was a bit weirded out by the idea of having potatoes in cake, but you actually only taste the chestnut! We also split a brown sugar hoddeok, it was good but would taste better fresh. We went to the store at night so I think the cakes might have been sitting out for a bit."}
{"text":"Where else can you find delicious freshly made walnut cakes at such a low price??  they have a handful of flavors to choose from, all of which are equally good.  ALSO, I find if you come here around when they are closing, the lady always gives you EXTRA walnut cakes and just stuffs the box full for you!!! ;) make sure you say thank you when that happens! hehe"}
{"text":"Took my girlfriend to Korea Town for our date wayyyy back, cause she has never seen the world. LOL While i was planning for the date, my friend highly recommended this place for snacks. So we got a couple of the \"walnut buns\" and the korean pancakes. Boy my girlfriend got addicted to those pancakes. The pancake is totally soul food in the winter, and there are seats in the bakery to hide from the cold. Later on, we have learned that their thin sliced cookies are soooo good too. Girlfriend still asks me to take her back there all the time. Homie place and lovely food. :)"}
{"text":"....Omg...yum. Thats my review.  YUMMY!  That's all that needs to be said"}
{"text":"A little bit sweet for me. Not a big fan. The pancakes are delicious but don't think I'll go back for those sweet"}
{"text":"Dear Hodo Kwaja,  Your walnut cakes are delicious and addicting. I almost contemplated going back there after I began snacking on them while on the way home but it was too cold outside.  But don't worry, I'll definitely be back for more, maybe even as early as tomorrow since you're open so late and on my way home from work (well, not really on my way home, but that can easily be rearranged).  One day I hope to see your walnut cake making machine in action but in the meantime, please continue making tasty goodness.  Red bean forever, Jan"}
{"text":"I wandered in quite by accident and was basically directed by all the signs on the walls to purchase some walnut cakes / so I tried the ones with the red beans in the centre - they were really nice and the cake actually looked like a walnut! Dope cakes."}
{"text":"Delicious mini desserts that make me so happy. Everything is made fresh in store. The walnut cakes come in three different flavours (walnut-potato, almond-potato, and red bean) and you have the option of mixing flavours in any order but red bean is by far my favourite of the three. They also have these mouthwatering pancakes. So good when it's served fresh off the grill. The brown sugar pancakes may sound overly sweet but it's just the perfect amount of sweetness. The best part is that these desserts can be packaged to go and still taste amazing the following day (if you don't eat it all before then!)"}
{"text":"We've always got their walnut cakes. Today I got my usual box of 30 and they had a funny eggy smell to them! Could not even get to my second walnut cake. This has never happened before."}
{"text":"Every time I go to Koreatown, I always stop here before going home. For the past few years, I have been getting the 30 for $9 walnut cake deal, so GOOD! Right when you walk in, the delicious scent hits you and it's hard to not buy anything there. I haven't tried the other options they have there but I will next time."}
{"text":"I have to go take a visit here every time I'm by Korean town. I absolutely love their walnut cakes (I mix the flavors between red bean, mash potato and walnut). They are amazingly delicious."}
{"text":"Hodo Kwaja is a really neat place to get all these little walnut cakes. Just love how they have the machines displayed in the front and so I can take photos of this boring young Korean male slaving over these freshly made cakes.  For $1.50/6 pieces I able to tried 3 flavours.. but I still love the traditional one with the red bean paste inside. Asian treats are always my fave because they are never overly sweet. The size is great to be ate as a pop in your mouth snacks.  The only disappointment is they are not fresh out of the oven warm, that's how I remembered from my first ever walnut cake experience in Seoul..."}
{"text":"As with any bakery, the best time to get your goods is when it is FRESH. Hodo Kwaja is no exception! The walnut cakes come in 4 different styles, either a potato or red bean filling, and either a walnut or almond topping.   Now I know potato as a filling may seem weird but they do some voodoo (probably a great amount of sugar) to it to make it slightly sweet. If you're feeling more of a sugar bomb, definitely get the red bean. The topping, I find, is less important and only imparts a subtle difference to the overall treat. If it is not fresh, it is a little soft, which isn't bad but definitely not preferable. Bring it home, and toast them in the oven/microwave oven for a bit. You will definitely not regret it.   Another staple to this place is the brown sugar pancake. For this you MUST get it fresh. It's not the same when its warm. Be mindful not to burn the hell out of your lips and chin though as it is lava."}
{"text":"I got the the red bean walnut cakes, and they were awesome. The cakes are loaded with red bean filling - barely sweetened red bean filling - which I love as they allow that natural flavour of the red bean to come through.  I also got one of the brown sugar pancakes, which I would only give two stars. It was pretty terrible - it tasted \"doughy\", and the brown sugar didn't have the depth that genuine brown sugar does.  So basically, just get the walnut cakes."}
{"text":"I decided to up this to 5 stars because I went around today and:  (1) When I walked through the door the three people behind the counter stopped what they were doing and greeted me with a smile, like they were actually happy that I was there and,  (2) When, more importantly, I inquired as to when they actually made the walnut cake I was provided a very specific answer... 11:00 to 12:30 and 4:20 (not 4:30, not 4:00, but 4:20) to 5:00 each day... but only in the morning on Sunday.  I managed to hold my self back from sampling until I could get there at one of the appointed times..."}
{"text":"Oh, how I wanted to love Hodo Kwaja...  So I went there on one rather cold day and tried the walnut cakes with mashed potato + walnut filling, mashed potato + almond filling, and red bean filling.  All were super tasty, with the red bean filling being my favourite.  But there's just one small problem... they're not hot! In fact, the hottest thing that I had was the coffee that I ordered on the side.   Good way to spend a cold day in winter, but I kind of wish that the walnut cakes were warmer... maybe it was my fault and I really should've waited for the new ones to come off the press?  (Having said that, I'm totally going to come back to try the walnut pancakes...)"}
{"text":"These walnut cakes have traveled the globe with me.  I have carried them to California.  I have carried them to Pennsylvania.  I have planned on carrying them to California but really eaten them in route, my family none the wiser.  It's mesmerizing to watch if you happen to catch the machine on the go.  & a freshly warm walnut cake?  Mmm.  Let's go sit in Christie Pits & catch up over the power of red bean.  Others have mentioned but I would be irresponsible if I didn't also mention - the Korean pancakes?  Careful when heated.  You think it is all fun & games but then all of a sudden you reach the molten hot brown sugar part & it explodes - potentially ruining taste-buds and t-shirt alike."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?!  Their walnut cakes!! I personally also liked their hotteok as well especially when it's freshly made and hot off the pan, they're sooo delicious!  You can see the whole operation of the walnut cake right in front of your eyes as the assembly line is in the front of the store. Each walnut cake is a mini walnut look alike piece of cake that has a piece of walnut in each piece. Each walnut cake comes in one of two flavors. Either red bean or sweet potato!   It's great as a gift at gatherings or celebrations and it's easy to snack on too!   LAST TIP?!  You can get it in variety of amounts. Either five or a dozen or thirty or even more! The hotteok is worth trying too if you want to sit down in their bakery in the back and enjoy it with a cup of coffee or another dessert they have in store! The hotteok is essentially a piece of pancake with brown sugar and pieces of crushed nuts in the middle!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to get some fresh Korean walnut cakes. They come in 3 flavours: mashed potato with walnut, mashed potato with almond, and red bean with walnut. My favourite one is mashed potato with walnut. They also have very good Korean pancakes. My favorite one is brown sugar pancake; tastes soo good when it's hot and fresh.  The price keeps going up slowly over the year but I still come here as there's no other competition around."}
{"text":"One time when I was at my friend Jen's house watching something sordid and depraved on channel 52, I asked her if she had anything to eat and she pointed to a small pastry box on her coffee table.   \"Eat one of those. They're Korean walnut cakes. Half are filled with sweet potato, and the others are filled with red bean paste.\" Note usage of the word ONE.  What followed was a ten minute game of Russian Roulette with red bean cakes standing in as the loaded gun cylinder. All of the walnut cakes looked the same, and I really, really didn't want to accidentally bite into the wrong one, because I once had a horrifying red bean paste incident at Asian Legend. I only bit into one red bean walnut cake, whew. But yeah, I totally ate the other six.  You can imagine how excited I was to return here tonight and pay for a dozen of my own walnut cakes (sweet potato filling, obvs) for merely $3. They're practically free, and I refuse to stop eating these little Korean delights!!"}
{"text":"The cakes are unique (to a westerner) and tasty. I don't know how authentic it would be, but i do wish they would make them fresh for the customers, rather than mostly handing them out from trays that were made earlier. they taste best warmed up!"}
{"text":"This place has some of the best and fresh Traditional Korean snacks available. They have this crazy assembly line-like machinery that pops out fresh Hodo Kwajas by the clock. They also have many different filling options as well as other snacks like the syrup filled pancakes. The workers there are always friendly and their service is to par with their awesome yummy delicacies. With every trip to Toronto (2 hours of driving, tolls and border), I make every effort to stop by.   This place is as good as it gets!"}
{"text":"I've enjoyed munching at Hodo Kwaja for a number of years now.    One of my two favourite items to order there are the walnut cakes (6/$2). Made fresh daily, and if you're extra lucky, served warm (from having just been made) to you.  The second thing that I enjoy ordering, once in a long time, are their fun Korean Pancakes!  $1.50/one. Watch when you first bite into or poke it - they might just squirt out some hot sugary liquid!  This place is a treat for any cheap but special date, or especially, if ppl are here from out of town and are open to seeing something that's not typical."}
{"text":"Delicious, well priced, and fast! Tried the walnut cakes and the red bean pancake, they were still warm. Would definitely come back for a dessert if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Great friendly service Delicious bake goods, desserts, coffee and iced coffee, and more Definitely recommend checking it out sadly that i know of, no vegan options :("}
{"text":"Always stop by this place for the walnut cakes and grab a fresh brown sugar pancake when I'm in the area. The place smells so good and I just can't help but indulge myself a little."}
