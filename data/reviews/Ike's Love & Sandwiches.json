{"text":"The sandwiches at this place are incredible ... I mean incredible. Not only are they unique with a huge selection to choose from, but they all seem to be equally amazing. They have a gigantic selection of vegetarian sandwiches, including a veggie meatball sandwich that is too-big-to-eat yet somehow you find yourself not able to stop. Their version of a turkey rueben is solid as well. And the dutch crunch bread is worth whatever calories are in it and more - and this is about the only place in AZ where I've seen this bread. I would highly recommend Ike's. It's hard to find in the back of the Brickyard on Mill, but don't let that stop you."}
{"text":"Another amazing sandwich!!
\"Sometimes I'm A Vegetarian\"
First half here & second half on top of A Mountain. 
All ways a great choice."}
{"text":"Can we just say AH-MAZING.?  

Amazing to find that one of San Francisco's BeSt sandwich shops has not only expanded throughout Northern California, but found a home not far from the ASU Campus...

Okay, when I first stepped into the Ike's on 16th Street in the City, I didn't.  I actually stood in line OUTSIDE the small shop for a while before ordering.  Yes, it's THAT popular.  

And when I did, i fell in love with the menu.  Sandwiches with fun names, some silly, some famous.  

I ordered for our group :  Barry Z., Barry B., and a Lincecum!!!,

I ask you, how could I not love a place that names sandwiches after iconic SF Giants players?  

Flash forward a few years.  Here we are in Arizona to visit family AND watch the World Series together.  Wouldn't it be great to have some yummy San Francisco treat?  I'm not talking Rice-A-Roni...  Low and behold, Ike's has a shop on Mills Avenue.

I got to meet Chase, the person bringing this little piece of sandwich heaven to Tempe.  What a nice young man.  Instant adoration since we were both sporting our Giants gear. Too fun.  And when my order proved too big for me to carry, he helped me out to my car.  Great service!

I do hope this shop becomes very successful.  The sandwiches are very Yum.  Too many to describe.  Check out their website for sandwich descriptions and know that no matter what the location, they make ANY sandwich on all of their menus....  

Next time we are in Tempe, we will be back.   And of course during Spring Training, when we are in town to cheer on our Giants!  I fully expect to wait in line, once the locals and college kids discover this new treasure...."}
{"text":"Arrghh... here again.. it's 3:15 in the afternoon. 2 customers in here and every table is dirty...again!!

Cmon guys get with it. Even through your sandwiches are awesome people are going to get tired of the grossness!

 Where's the management? 

Food is 5 star,  cleanliness is 0

This is about my 10th visit here since they opened. When I'm working In the area I stop in for an amazing sandwich. I can't remember if I've ever been impressed by the cleanliness. 

Anyone who has eaten here knows the sandwiches are big and kind of messy  ( in a good way ).. so when I say dirty tables and floors it's not just just a few crumbs  on the table... it's literally gross,  tables, floors, drink area, grime on the booths that are more than just from the lunch rush.  
There is a general laziness if you watch the employees when they do give a table a quick wipe. I hope the kitchen does not show the same lack of cleanliness :(

Ike...Bring in some employees who genuinely care about your brand and making your restaurant as awesome as It should be... All around.

 Best of luck to you, you have an amazing concept. 

I'll be glad to edit my review at a later time.

If anyone else notices the same thing, help Ike out and put the word out. We love eating here and should feel like it's a clean and safe establishment."}
{"text":"Dear lord I have met the love of my life...haha I honestly tried this place for the first time today and I can already tell it's going to be one of my favorites! I'm what u call week day vegetarian and I love that I can get pro veggie sandwiches that are DELICIOUS! Try the jeremey it's soooooo good!"}
{"text":"I moved to AZ 2 years ago from the Bay Area, and every time I went back I made sure to hit up Ike's at least once. When I found out they were opening a place here I was ecstatic. Best sandwiches ever, you can't go wrong on the huge menu."}
{"text":"By far the best sandwich shop ever. I keep thinking I have a favorite then I try something new. Right now I am stuck on the Mrs.Robinson on French. It's fried chicken, provolone, Frank's red hot and ranch. Lettuce, add red onion. It makes me cry a little thinking about it.:) The staff is amazing as well. Even if their slammed their is one girl who has taken my order several times, that always is smiley and super sweet. Ike's I don't know what you do your sandwiches, but Thank You for doing it!"}
{"text":"Vegan XXX Tina and the Vegan Meatball are my favorites but everything coming out of the kitchen there seams awesome!!"}
{"text":"Love there sandwiches!! Even my picky kiddos love it!! They're all amazing  you need to try it not your ordinary sandwich!"}
{"text":"One of the best sandwich places in Tempe!
The staff are always helpful if you ask them and so nice! Go Ike's"}
{"text":"Deffinetly Love BEFORE sandwiches! The staff was awesome,the food was on point and I will be returning. Also has an amazing vegetarian menu. Make sure to have some time on your hands because the menu is quite lenghthy but A LOT of great choices."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The gluten free bread is the best I have ever had. Soft, moist, and the perfect texture! They really have it down and their food all just tastes so good. Customer service was also great. I am very pleased."}
{"text":"Easily the best sandwich I've ever had.  At first I felt it was a bit pricey for a sandwich.  My coworker said that if I didn't enjoy the sandwich he would personally give me my money back. So I said what the hell. Its also next door to my work.  I tried the mozzarella sandwich, I forgot the name of it. It was the most rich and delicious sandwich I have ever had.  In fact so rich that you could be pleased by only eating half and saving the other for later, considering they so conveniently cut it in half. Diagonally,  by the way, the best way to cut a sandwich.  This place rocks. Everyone should go, it's worth every penny."}
{"text":"Yep, kind of misleading address, front door is actually not on Mill, but walk around the Brickyard on Mill building, you'll find it.  Last week visited with daughters and I ordered the Madison Bumgarner w/tomatoes on Dutch Crunchy bread.  It was fantastic, really.  Had a stack of napkins in front of me when I was done, wiped my mouth with every bite.  The yellow bbq sauce was so good, complimented the meat perfectly.  Every time I go to Ike's I stare at the menu until the very last second before ordering, so many great sandwiches from which to choose.  Best sandwich shop in Tempe, for sure."}
{"text":"Best Sandwhich I have EVER eaten!!!! Seriously!!!!
And, I am a foodie. Soooo glad they are in AZ now.
Not the greatest location, but it is worth the drive and the staff is super awesome!
Plus, you can pick sandwiches from the San Francisco location that is not on the menu here. And an added bonus is that they have a ton of vegetarian and gluten-free options for all of my friends."}
{"text":"The food is so yummy and the staff is so sweet:) Lots of options for vegans and vegetarians. 10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"Sandwich was amazing. I'd recommend to anyone looking for a variety of subs that taste great."}
{"text":"So good.  I was craving a true deli sandwich this past weekend for my cheat day and had to try Ikes considering I'm from San Francisco.  My dad and I tried the sf cheesesteak on yummy sourdough and the Matt Cain on the Infamous dutch crunch.  Mmmm. Whatever that sauce is it's bomb. My dad says there's less meat on the sandwich compared to the original Delis in the bay area but they're still delicious.  Way better than typical chains around the valley. Pricey but worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! First time I went was in Santa Clara, CA. I was blown away with the amount of flavor in a sandwich. The restaurant had a huge line out the door, we figured this place must be good; and good it was! Came home to AZ and told my family and friends about how amazing these sandwiches were. When we found the one in Mesa we had to go! I have been twice to the Mesa location and the employees are always upbeat! My family went and was blown away about the uniqueness of the store and the sandwiches! The amount of food they give on each sandwich is great! Always enough to have leftovers! We will be back of coarse!"}
{"text":"I use them all the time for my company meetings and everyone always loves the selections and quality of the sandwiches.  They are super friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"A little \"hole in the wall\" that can be difficult to find as it is not facing Mill Ave.  Since it was my first time I was a bit overwhelmed with the choices.  One of the employees came out to chat with me and explain everything, which was a pretty big help.

I got a sandwich - I can't tell you what sandwich it was, but it was good.  Like really good.

Looking for a quick lunch, that is a little different and is tasty?  Ike's is a great place to go."}
{"text":"Is this place owned by the same as hookmeup? Some stuff seems very similar, but I enjoy this place much better. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing! I discovered the one in San Fran from a friend and loved it. The cashier told me there would be one opening in Mesa and I had to try it. Must say it is AWESOME. I had the vegan Tom Brady and the vegan Bud Bundy (on the San Fran menu - not this one, but they will make almost anything on the online menu for you), then I had the vegan Handsome Owl (my new favorite). The vegan Brutus is okay but nothing to write home about, but this place has hands down the best vegan sandwiches I have ever eaten... EVER. Oh yeah Ike was at the restaurant when me and my dad went."}
{"text":"Amazing place with great vegan options as well as gluten free! I had the meatless mike with vegan meatballs - amazing !!!"}
{"text":"Really good choice for Gluten Ftee.  DELICIOUS bread.  Lots of choices for fixins.  Just as delicious as when we visited Ikes in San Francisco."}
{"text":"This is my go-to sandwich place, i love the gluten free (no extra charge), vegan & vegetarian options. However things seemed to have gone downhill over this past summer. I always get the chipper's fave and despite constantly asking if there is avocado in it, which i can assure you it SHOULD, i get avocado in it exactly 10% of the time. Why am i paying for an unusually expensive sandwich that doesn't even come with the correct ingredients? My husband's order also came out incorrect too. Training is severely lacking at this location."}
{"text":"Every sandwich is better than the next. Never order the samething twice and there are over 500 types of sandwiches. The dirty sauce and make variation that much better. Every experience has been great and the people that work there are very helpful. Everyone should check this place out. Best sandwiches in AZ"}
{"text":"Resturant layout is awkward, prices are high, service is slow, and the sandwiches are okay at best. Firehouse or Potbelly are a much better choices."}
{"text":"My favorite place now to get a sandwich. Very friendly staff and great atmosphere. I thought the price was high for a sandwich, until the sandwich came out and it was big! I was completely stuffed. 
The place is very unique and the menu names for the sandwiches are hilarious."}
{"text":"The Dutch crunch bread was incredible. The portions were large enough for two light lunches. Best when eaten right away; hot & fresh. The staff was fun and energized."}
{"text":"This is by far the best sandwich I have ever had.  My mother was with me and she felt the same way.   I would rate it a 10 on the 5 star scale, and I can't think of another that I would even rate a 5. People were friendly, too.  In my opinion, the location is bad because you almost have to know its there to find it; but its not bad in any other way.  I hope they open other stores that are closer to my daily life, but in the mean time I will be driving to Mesa regularly to get a sandwich from Ikes. YUMMY!!!"}
{"text":"Ok. This is why I LOVE Yelp. This place as awesome. Great atmosphere, not too loud. The dreamy smell of fresh bread and sauces fills the space. There are a ton of options to choose from but we got great recommendations with the Paul Reuben and Hollwoods SF Cheesecake. They even had Gluten Free Bread and it was fantastic. Need it bagged up, they kindly take it and do it for you!!  Love love love this place."}
{"text":"201. Adam Richman -  amazing sandwich. Fried chicken, ham, honey, pesto, avocado and Swiss. 

Definitely will be back. Nice break from the other basic sandwich spots."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sandwich shop I have found here in AZ. I eat here whenever I make it out that way. Everything I've tried is tasty."}
{"text":"First time here and really liked it. Very unique sandwiches I had the Bella and spouse had the a spicy jalapeños sandwich.  Large sandwiches and kinda pricey but good!"}
{"text":"Got the Adam Richman on Sourdough, it was so good! I could'nt even finish the whole thing it is so big. My hubby got the Shawn Michael with jalapeño poppers and he enjoyed that, but said he liked mine more. The staff is extremely polite here and very enthusiastic....and we got to jam to music we grew up on in the 90s early 00s. 
Overall we will be back!"}
{"text":"Giving this a 4...but...the reason I stopped in was for their world famous Dutch crunch bread.  I've only had it one other place (Palm Springs), so I was very excited.  However...at noon-ish on a Monday, after I ordered, I was informed they were out of the bread.  How does that happen?!  So moving on...I got the Reggie Jackson...it was awesome!  Even on plain old wheat bread.  Full disclosure:  they did give me a coupon for my next stop in because of the bread situation.  Overall, huge menu selection, friendly service...just get the bread in!!!"}
{"text":"Food is awesome, one the best sandwiches I've ever had. The service is awesome as well. Why four stars you ask. The music. It's too loud, and it's unedited (which is mildly unprofessional, because who wants to hear f-bombs while they're eating WITH THEIR KIDS) Other than that it's amazing, just think twice about bringing the kids with. Worth a shot."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwich!  The Dutch crunch bread is excellent and everything was fresh.  I am not a sandwich person, but I was meeting a friend who is vegan and they had quite a bit of options.  He also thought the sandwich was delicious.  I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Was a regular when living in Mesa.  Best sandwiches ever.  Gluten free bread is amazing.  They also have vegan cheese.  The sandwiches do get a little greasy, at least the Tony Soprano that I usually get--could just be the dressing on that one.  I'm not a huge candy guy but the free caramel apple pop dessert is a nice touch too.  And nice to get a free bag of chips during 4-7pm happy hour--the onion ones are GF and delish."}
{"text":"Really good veggie sandwich selection.  Delicious and fresh.  Get the Dutch Crunch bread! Had the I Dream of Jeannie sandwich.  Was very spicy but I like spicy."}
{"text":"Beware the addicting sandwhich's.... But a word of warning go to the store, do not do delivery unless you want a $9 sandwhich to cost $20 with the fees. (And it is a 40 minute delivery wait im literally about .1 miles, so i should have walked there... But its hot)  

So but seriously their sandwhichs are amazing!!"}
{"text":"If I could 6 stars I would. My go to place for good vegan subs. They have vegan meat options so no more just salad with italian dressing on a bun only. The Handsome Owl is my favorite. And I love that they have zapp's potato chips"}
{"text":"I had to try this place based on the proximity and all the positive yelp reviews.  Needless to say, I was not disappointed.  The sandwich I had (I believe they called it a Yale University) which was a modified Menage a Trios was absolutely delicious!  I thought the price was kind of high for a sandwich but since I was able to get two meals out of it so that makes it more reasonable.

The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable about their menu.  It was on of the staff members who suggested the modified sandwich."}
{"text":"Went with a group of friends a little over a month ago.  There a lot of unique subs on offer, I tried one with a teriyaki kind of sauce to it.

I compared notes with a few of my friends after, and we thought our sandwiches were just alright.  The main complaint is that the sauce drenched the bread and all of our sandwiches were soggy by about midway through eating it.

I recommend (to the business) to provide the liquid sauces outside the sub so that this does not happen."}
{"text":"Great Vegan Sammies!! We loved it. My husband had the pilgrim and I had the Bud Bundy! Both vegan and both fantastic. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Just amazing sandwich and names that make no sense but that is the genius part hahaha trying to figure them out. Cool music too even my 3 year old was singing along to Naughty by Nature lol"}
{"text":"I got the ménage à trois. It was really good! Didn't really like paying 11 bucks for it though. Place was really clean and staff was friendly. 4stars only because of the price."}
{"text":"Employees here are stoned but not as much as Cheba Hut's.. With that said, customer service is good, besides workers moving slow..
I got the Madison Bumgarner... Let me first say, Jake Arrieta is better at EVERYTHING compared to Bumgarner, except for getting a sandwich named after himself.. It is one of the best sandwiches in the valley... a must try."}
{"text":"$3.79 for 8 cold tater tots. Are you kidding me? We ordered 2 orders (I almost only got one, thinking that it would probably be enough) and therefore spent over $8 (with tax) for 16 tater tots. That were cold. And bland. It left such a bad taste in my mouth (figuratively and literally) that the sandwich was probably better than it seemed. No interest in returning."}
{"text":"Amazing. Best sandwiches in Tempe, probably the valley. They're super duper great when it comes to Gluten Free, they take extra precautions to make it not cross contaminated, which is amazing when you're defective like me! Plus the service is alway A+. It is a little pricey, but it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"Been here twice. The sandwiches are nice. Dutch Crunch is my new vice. You get a lot for a decent price."}
{"text":"Not the most visible spot on Mill Ave but definitely worth the extra 30 yard walk off the main strip. First time here but I haven't had a sandwich this food in a long time! Their dirty sauce is awesome and there a ton of sandwich options. I will be back for more!!!! 

*Not a lot of seating in the store itself so plan on taking it to go during the lunch hour or eating in the shade outside."}
{"text":"I tried Ike's for the first time today and they got my order wrong. I figured, it happens, right? We all have THOSE days. So I called figuring they'd give me a credit or something. NO! They drove a fresh sandwich to me! The sandwich was supersonic delicious and it was one of the BEST customer service experiences I've ever had in my life! Thank you Tucker, Gregory and the rest of the gang at the Mesa, AZ location. You ROCK! I'll be back and I'll bring friends! :)"}
{"text":"Ike's is the sandwich shop that's just a wee bit too expensive to be a daily dive. The sandwiches are great. The menu is ridiculously awesome and you will find something you like but ten bucks for a sandwich and drink makes me feel unhappy the next day talking to my friends about it.

YOU SHOULD STILL GO. The place is good but just don't plan on going too often"}
{"text":"This is a little gem. We always went to Subway if we were in the mood for a sub... Not anymore. The sandwiches are absolutely amazing. The selection is so great that it can be overwhelming. I have been going there for the last year and haven't had the same sub- No disappointments here."}
{"text":"Always fresh, filling sandwiches with friendly service. Locally owned and Delicious, something for  every taste."}
{"text":"This place had high hopes. The meat in my sandwhich Tasted and smelled bad. My family and I all got sick after eating here."}
{"text":"Great sandwich place!  I had the Meatless Mike and was surprised by how good the vegan meatballs are. Great service!"}
{"text":"Just had a meatless mike jolt red soda and sweet creole onion chips and I've never been more satisfied    Amaze"}
{"text":"Great friendly service and delicious sandwiches . Jalapeño poppers was really good as well. We will come back. :)"}
{"text":"Great sandwich shop.... I can't say much more when they are simply doing it right. I love their bread, the perfect foundation for a top notch sandwich. the staff is friendly and ready to cater to your satisfaction. They have too many mouth watering options to choose from and create your own/ custom built any way you want it."}
{"text":"SO happy Ike's is in Arizona! I'd eat here a couple times a week if it was closer to my house. There are dozens of vegetarian (and vegan) options. My favorite is the Bella on Dutch crunch bread but substitute the Halal chicken for the vegan breaded chicken. Husband gets Ménage A Trois & adds stuffed jalapeño poppers. Sandwiches are huge. 
They're open 10-8 every day. Go eat here. You will not regret it."}
{"text":"Good sized sandwich for a decent price.  I bought the Hollywood SF cheesesteak.  The bread was fresh and the flavors were yum.  The delivery took a little while but was worth the wait.  Will be adding them in to my lunch rotation."}
{"text":"Impressive.  I must say I have tried over 5 different sandwiches and they are were great!  My favorite is the Bear Hug, Spiffy Iffy, and Adam Richman.  I understand they are a little pricey but worth the money.  You won't realize how good they are until the next day when you are craving a sandwich and Jimmy Johns, subway, etc just wont do.  Highly recommend them.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I had he misfortune of living in the Bay Area for 6 years. Ike's at Stanford was one of the only good things about it. 

From what I understand, Ike's has developed thousands of sand which combinations over the years. My personal favorites are the Damon Bruce and the Reggie Jackson (you'll notice that the sandwiches are typically named after someone, lots of sf giants players on the menu). 

This place just opened in an odd corner of Mesa on valentines day. The best thing about it is there was no line and no San Francisco people that you had to deal with in order to get a great sandwich."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, fast service, food amazing, and all of their sandwiches are named after celebrities which I found pretty cool. The only thing holding me back from a 5 star review is that they were out of chips the last time I was there, but stuff happens ;)"}
{"text":"The food is good. However, the service is super slow. they lose a lot of business because they can't  manage the lunch rush.  I  have visited several times and every time its the same thing.  Expect your order to take forever I can't say it enough."}
{"text":"My favorite sandwich shop from San Francisco has made it's way to AZ! Had it for the first time at the new location today and was amazing as usual. The dirty sauce and Dutch crunch bread are a must."}
{"text":"Amazing (as always). We were trilled to find an Ike's in AZ.  That said, it somewhat cheapens the experience when you don't wait in line for an hour and then hurriedly eat your sandwich on the sidewalk."}
{"text":"Absolutely the longest I've ever waited for a sandwich.  Not worth it. Skip this place. Its seriously like they start planting the grain when you order the bread."}
{"text":"Ike's has quickly become one of my wife and I's favorite sub spots. It never disappoints. 
I love their overall atmosphere, their dedication to creating delicious food, and their ability to have fun doing it!
My favorite part is just the novelty of it all. Their sandwiches range from (essentially) a standard roast beef all the way to subs stuffed with 4 kinds of cheese, Tater tots, veggies, and habanero sauce. This place is great for carnivores and veggies alike, and definitely will fill up anyone wanting to cash out the 10 bucks per sub. 
Bottom line: WORTH EVERY PENNY! Mmmm!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh. First time I went to this place and was a little wary because of all the options, most of which I had never heard of before. We were there during happy hour as well which I didn't know they even had so we got free chips and soda!! Amazingly delicious sandwich and such great service! Definitely coming back soon!"}
{"text":"First and foremost, the sandwiches here are great & the service is generally good.

Unfortunately, today I showed up at 10:50 to wait for them to open. There were lots of people inside, & I was waiting with a few other customers for them to open. After waiting for ten minutes in 100 degrees, we were all extremely uncomfortable & overheated. At 11:05, their door was still locked & but someone did come out to take our orders. She did not unlock the door or offer any of us water. It is now past 11:15 & nothing has changed, only there are about ten people sweating outside with us now. I just really wish that Ike's could have taken the few minutes it takes to open their doors & let us cool off while they're playing catch-up. Living in Arizona, keeping us outside is pretty inhumane, all ten of us are still out here & it's been 20 minutes since they were supposed to open."}
{"text":"Great food. But is I.t just me or did their sandwiches get significantly smaller while keeping the size the same?"}
{"text":"First time trying this place today and it was so tasty! I had the \"Iffy Tiffy\" and my husband had the \"Madison Bumgarner\". They were both great! I do have some unfinished business and a few others to try since their menu has so many options. Can't wait to try a few more!"}
{"text":"\"Best sandwich I've ever had in my life!\"  Those were the words of my wonderful fiancé.  I have to say, I echo those EXACT same sentiments.  Ike's lived up to it's reputation, and the hype!  GIANT sandwiches!!!  Super friendly service, could not have been more welcoming and accommodating.  Go to Ike's, in fact go right now!  You will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Because I like to eat relatively bigger meals when going out (as well as whenever I eat), I enjoy this place's variety. I usually get the almost 30$ sandwich known as The Kryptonite on their famous dutch crunch bread because it has virtually every ingredient on it including the various meats, mozzarella sticks, jalapeno poppers, avocado, pesto... I mean come on, it's ridiculous but great. It actually comes as two separately wrapped sandwiches ('krypto' written on one wrapper and 'knight', 'night', or 'nite' on the other) that I end up saving one of for the next day. The workers usually verify that I'm ordering the correct thing because I guess its not commonly ordered (as workers shout to each other, \"we've got a kryptonite!\"). \"You want the almost $30 dollar sandwich?!\" Yes, yes I do. See you soon my beautifully tasty, filling sandwich."}
{"text":"I'm no food critic, but the staff was friendly and it was prob one of the best sandwich's I've ever had. They prob have a sandwhich for everyone."}
{"text":"This has been my go-to place for a quick, tasty lunch. The food is good, and the service is friendly. Sadly, they have recently eliminated their lunch specials, effectively doubling the price of a meal. In doing so, they've priced themselves out of reach of their primary market: ASU students."}
{"text":"OMIGOSH!!  Nothing but love for these sandwiches!  I had the most amazing sandwich - Desperate Housewives - on dutch crunch.  It would be what I would consider the gateway 'drug' into the Ike's Love & Sandwich world!  That halal chicken is OFF THE HOOK, perfectly paired with buffalo sauce, provolone cheese and bacon - how's a girl supposed to eat her way through all 400+?  Your staff was nothing but helpful, enthusiastic and excited to 'share the love'!  I live in Denver, but come down quarterly for business - and will be sure this is added to my 'mandatory store visits'."}
{"text":"Holy cow, i can't even tell you in words how good these sandwiches are. I crave there food everyday because it's so delicious and unique. they have TONS vegetarian options too and they can help you make those options vegan if you need too. I love that they cater to vegans as well as meat eaters. It's good for all types of people! Go if you love food and sandwiches!!!!!"}
{"text":"Well, if your here for a great sammie, this is the place to be.  I heard about this place a while back in mesa, then found out it opened in Tempe. Before the ASU/UCLA game (GO DEVILS!!!!!) I was in the mood for a gut busting dinner before I cheer on my Devils. I've been working out and eating really well for about 3 weeks before this and decided to break that cycle for a splurge with the \"Adam Richman\". WOW! Was that a great sammie. Fried chicken, ham, avocado, honey, pesto and all the add ons available. Who can possibly go wrong with that. The house bread also was amazing. Highly recommend. It's. Little messy, but worth it for every single bite. The staff was helpful and nice as well. I recommend this place and will definitely be back for some other crazy choices."}
{"text":"Super delicious but they ran out of their crunch bread which is so lame! Sandwiches are delicious though, and perfect for sharing if your not super hungry."}
{"text":"I tried the tony soprano sub which of coarse is there Italian.  It is one of the best I've had in town.   Great job Ike's!!"}
{"text":"Yelp, you didn't let me down. I see why this place have so many great reviews. This is a great sandwich place. There are tons of choices, but the staff is there to help out. 

Have a big appetite, they're sandwiches will definitely fill you up. I could only eat half and I was stuffed. This is going to be one of my go to places if I'm back in the area. 

If you are in the mood for a hearty sandwich, then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Being from the Bay Area, it is SO hard to find a good sandwich even close to comparable in Arizona, but Ike's, being a San Francisco born company, really hits the mark. It's my little piece of home here and I love it. Their sandwiches are always fresh and always taste amazing. The bear hug is my personal favorite (it's those jalapeño poppers!). Whatever sandwich you get, you must have it on Dutch crunch, and yes, I do mean MUST. The experience without it just isn't the same. I have never had a poor experience here and everyone I recommend to try it or bring here has had nothing but excitement and praise for the food. Way to make this Bay Area girl a little less homesick!"}
{"text":"I went on a search for a deli that had Dutch Crunch bread and failed about 2 years ago.  I recently went to Monterey and went to Ike's out there and it was so good, I was telling everyone about the Dutch Crunch that they were missing out on in Arizona.  One person did a search and thankfully found that Ike's opened up in AZ!  So naturally I had to take a peek for myself.  The sandwich was by far the best deli sandwich I've had in Arizona, AND they actually have Dutch Crunch bread!  The bread was a bit different from Northern California Dutch Crunch, but it was close enough for me.  The ingredients they use are also way better than what most delis use.  It's a bit pricey but totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Best sandwiches ever. I also appreciate the feel of the place. I got the \"Sometimes I'm a Vegetarian\" and OMG amazing. My husband got the \"Matt Cain\" and loved it. If this was closer to me (I live about 3 hours away) I'd be here all the time. Reasonable prices too."}
{"text":"One of the only gluten free friendly sandwich shops it seems.  Any sandwich can be made gf unless u want onion rings in there (batter is wheat).  This place is clean super busy always but very good.  Pretty cool sandwich shop everyone is nice."}
{"text":"My friends and I drive all the way out from Glendale to gobble these sandwiches. Besides the superb flavor, the manager Tucker always provides unparalleled service. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"For the price of the sandwich, where's the beef? I'm being freakin serious here!  All bread, toppings and minimum amount of protein. I made a better sandwich when I was 12 . Unacceptable!"}
{"text":"Yumalisciousness! I'm not even a big sandwich person, but Ike's definitely has my love. The Dutch Crunch bread is the bomb and the dirty sauce is just garlicky goodness! Staff is fun and friendly and the menu offers one-of-a-kind exciting combinations! All sandwiches are hot and made to order and customized to your level of awesomeness. This place is always packed at lunch time so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"This is my favorite lunch place by far! The sandwiches are creative, full of flavor, and variety, and on top of all that, when I asked for a lettuce wrap...they wrapped the exact same sandwich with lettuce as thick as the bread would have been. They are so friendly and nice. They even stayed late to serve me when I brought my family in one night after going to SunSplash...we were tired and hungry, and the whole staff made it a fun place to be for all of us. We didn't even know we made them stay overtime, until we were leaving. What great people, and amazing food!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. Tons of choices. Service excellent. Best sandwich shop in the valley!!!"}
{"text":"So frustrated with Ike's! The sandwiches are great, when they are made as ordered. The first time I came in I asked for no cheese and when I got back to my office, there was cheese on the sandwich. The second time I asked for light dirty sauce (I'm not a huge mayo fan) and when I got back to my office, the sandwich was slathered with tons of sauce. I couldn't even eat most of it, but didn't have time to go back and have it re-made. At their price point, not sure I will risk going back."}
{"text":"Went to Ike's today for lunch.  Got a Spiffy Tiffy on the Crunch bread and oh my, my.  Absolutely delish!  Service was super friendly too.  Will definitely be back..."}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp, we tried Ike's today and was not disappointed.  Not only was the staff incredibly helpful but they suggested great sandwiches! The sandwiches were huge and the voodoo chips were so yummy (never had a flavored chip that good before). Had we known how big the sandwiches were, we would not have ordered fries and onion rings....though they were fantastic! Make sure to get their crunch bread, it was fantastic and different from anything I have ever had! This is now our favorite sandwich stop and we can't wait to go again.  On a side note, we met Ike and he was very charming.  He took the time to talk with us and even let us snap a picture! So nice to meet the man behind the food and see how genuine he is. Fingers crossed for an Ike's in Gilbert next!"}
{"text":"What a great sandwich shop! I love the vibration and I love the menu, they have a ton of different options for meat eaters, vegetarians, and vegans alike.  The staff is super friendly and helpful.... I can't wait to come back and try a different sandwich option!!"}
{"text":"Best of all time. This is the only sandwich I will eat now practically, highly recommend"}
{"text":"Great service, great selection, great sandwiches! Had the Papa Sam, and my son enjoyed the Kevin Bacon. Liked their signature bread, fresh ingredients, and friendly staff. Will be back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I'm originally from the bay area and there was an Ike's 15 mins away from me that I religiously went to. So when I saw an Ike open in Mesa I was unbeliveably excited! I got my usual, the Menage a Trois and it definitely tasted like home. Each sandwich is made with some type of crack sauce because it all becomes very addicting. Fortunately they said delivery might not be too far off in the feature!

What set this Ike's apart was definitely the service though. The manager was amazing, considerate and very helpful. We ordered 8 sandwiches and she packaged each one seperately for us, put in individual reciepts and even labeled each one with hearts. She made the whole experience enjoyable and easy. I am definitely going back again!"}
{"text":"I've tried many sandwiches and never been disappointed. The sandwiches are huge and very involved! Must have the Dutch crunch bread!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches are big and good, but Ike's Tempe is too pricey for a sandwich shop in this college town.

Many of their veg/vegan sandwiches lack a proper protein source, so by the time you've added one of their meatless proteins, a $10 sandwich can be $14.

The variety of meatless protein options (lots of fake meats) is great, though, and the Dutch crunch can be very good."}
{"text":"The staff was great and they seemed genuinely excited that I was in there even though it was less than a half an hour before closing. The food was great and the sandwich while little pricey for a sandwich place delivered a generous portion worth the price paid . will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This place is great and has earned a spot in the office lunch rotation. There are so many different sandwich options with a number of sandwiches named after ASU and Arizona sports figures along with several SF Giants and other actors/athletes. It takes a few minutes for the food to come out, but well worth the wait. The last time I was there I ran into Ike himself who was kind enough to chat for a few minutes, take a picture, and hook me up with a free drink/chips coupon for my next visit. Which will be very soon."}
{"text":"Split three different sandwiches with my co-workers for lunch today. Couldn't pick a favorite. They were all amazing!"}
{"text":"I chose this location based on previous yelp reviews on a trip to Phoenix.

Overall I think it was okay.  Lots of hype about the Dutch crunch bread - tasted like crunchy stale bread to me...not a fan.  

Although the redeeming quality of the place was definitely the uniqueness of sandwich options as well as the ingredients in the sandwich. I thought the dirty sauce was quite delicious.  I had the \"Adam Richman\" sandwich which included chicken, ham, honey, pesto, avocado and Swiss cheese.  I was a little apprehensive at first but based on the employee's suggestion I went with it and was pleasantly surprised.  

I also thought the service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Loved it the first time but today was terrible. I had raved about this place and posted it on two different local FB pages saying how great it was. Today my sandwich was so skimpily made and the \"Dutch crunch\" bread that I have dreamt about since my first visit was not crunchy at all. The manager was only slightly apologetic and when I showed her the small bit of artichoke leaf and that the rest was lettuce she kept insisting it was all artichoke.

She did say their baker has been baking inconsistently lately. I don't know why they would accept inferior product.

She did have the kitchen staff remake the sandwich but it felt extremely uncomfortable.

The second sandwich was tasty, but the overall experience was disappointing."}
{"text":"The MILF is amazing! Ike himself recommended it to me. If you like Frank's hot sauce and Jalepeno poppers that will be your go-to sandwich. I always add a side of dirty sauce. My hubby and I love Ikes! Good service and good food."}
{"text":"This place is great for vegetarians/vegans - lots of tasty options.  I had the Lynda Carter - it was this amazing eggplant creation!  The sandwich is enormous - I could only eat half - but I was dying to gobble the whole thing.  Great staff, clean and bright restaurant, good menu, love it!   I WANT ONE IN DALLAS/FT WORTH - YOU HEAR ME IKE?"}
{"text":"Good prices, excellent sandwiches.  I have had the turkey cranberry thanksgiving sandwich every time I've been and the reason why is that it's one of the best sandwiches I've ever had.  The garlic sauce plays so beautifully with the cranberry.  Thank you for making such a delicious sandwich.  Customer for life!
I taste the love for sure."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are delicious from here, good decent size, but they are overpriced and there are not any gluten free options. 

$18 for 2 sandwiches with no side or beverage is a little much...

I did however like how you can customize your sandwich and the cashier rolls through every option possible on it. 

3 stars. But definitely no more."}
{"text":"We used to go to Ike's alllllll the time when we lived in San Jose, and so when my boyfriend and I found this place here in Mesa, we were beyond excited.

But these sandwiches were DISGUSTING!

Your Dutch Crunch tasted stale and chalky. 
Your meats were dry and pastey.
And your condiments and sauce--which had made you taste so heavenly--were not even in our sandwiches!

We were soooo disappointed and felt soooo ripped off after eating here. Sorry Ike, we will never eat with you again, the love is gone :("}
{"text":"The sandwiches are great and hands down the best on Mill. As one friend said, they can make pretty much anything you can think of.

For vegans, make sure that you say \"vegan\" with every thing that you order, and make sure you get blowpops instead of a caramel lollipop. Most of the time they'll mess up that last part.

So far my top 3 have been the vegan meatless mike, the vegan pilgrim, and the vegan pee wee. The sandwiches are huge and come out to about 2 meals. However, because they're so wet, they don't last more than a few hours before getting too soggy."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches! Glad they are in the neighborhood! Gotta do Dutch crunch and dirty sauce. I had the Elvis Keith added jalapeño, super good. Onion rings are really tasty but not that big of an order for sharing. So come eat here!  Very friendly guy at the counter from the San Francisco location."}
{"text":"Very very good.. My sub had a great flavor to it and they were generous on the meat and toppings.. The only thing I can say is.. If you plan on getting a side of fries.. One sticker shock its $5(not worth it) but second, it's a nice size portion(not $5 worth size) but still.. Overall, cool concept and great food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food is always good, customer service is almost always poor. I just waited 30 minutes for the two employees to make 2 sandwiches with only one other customer waiting in front of me. We'll see if they finish them soon, because I'm still waiting while the employees just gossip in the back...they're literally just standing there talking. Thanks, guys!"}
{"text":"Love This Sandwhich Spot...Marilyn Monroe Or Ike's Love For Sexy!!!"}
{"text":"Ike's Place- Out of this world sandwiches! They have over 1000 sandwiches and so it is a bit overwhelming. However, you literally cant go wrong with any of them! My buddy Keith recommended this place to us and we thought it was only in San Fran. Come to find out it is in our backyard and we could never be more happy!

- Bear Hug: Bacon, extra dirty sauce, Mushrooms, Stuffed Jalapeno Poppers, Thinly Sliced Rib Eye Steak 
***It has a little bit of spice, tons of flavor. Not my favorite but certainly worth the try. You love it!***

- The Count of Monte Chase-o: Ham, Strawberry Preserves, Swiss, Turkey . ***Okay this one might be my favorite!! It's a little less calories then most and the flavors are unreal! The preserves absolutely makes this sandwich!!! THIS IS A MUST!! My new favorite!!!

- Tony Soprano- Ham, Italian Dressing, Provolone, Salami, Turkey ***This one is okay to me. Now when I say okay, I mean it's better than most Italian sandwiches and so if you like Italian than you will love this. Make sure to get the crunch roll :) ***

Adam Richman- Avocado, Fried Chicken, Ham, Pesto, Real Honey, Swiss ***Okay my wife dreams about two things, ME and this sandwich. It's unreal!! All the flavors compliment each other and it's so amazing!  This is a MUST and we recommend you get this out of them all. It will not disappoint! Get this on their crunch roll***"}
{"text":"I had the Michael Jordan and Mozzarella sticks. The Michael Jordan (meatball sub) was very tasty! The Mozzarella sticks were also great but they were $4 for 4 sticks that weren't all that big. Overall very good meal."}
{"text":"This is quite possibly my new favorite sandwich shop. We were recommended here by my brother in law and we were not disappointed! Their menu took up one wall, with so many choices we didn't know where to start. One of the guys working there could see we were struggling so he came right over and gave us some recommendations. I had the bella and it was absolutely amazing! The chips were delicious, some odd flavors but very good. Between the friendly service, crazy amount of options, and delicious food we will definately be back!"}
{"text":"You are wasting your time reading this review. Your time would be much better spent eating at Ike's. Seriously. Stop reading this and go eat as many Ike's sandwiches as you can. You will not regret it. I have yet to find a less than amazing sandwich on the menu."}
{"text":"We really love Ike's massive selection of sandwiches! They have more sandwiches than any five sandwich shops combined and if you don't see what you want then just ask, chances are that they can make it for you. Be sure to try your sandwich on their Dutch Crunch bread, it's wonderfully different.

I personally am fond of the Count of Monte Chase-o nomnomnom."}
{"text":"If you have to cut wheat out of your diet because of a doctor's orders, you might fear that your days of having subway sandwiches is gone. However, Ike's is here to fix that. Their gluten-free subs are amazing, and they were able to accommodate many of my other food intolerances as well. Fantastic place. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Bomb!! Got the meatless meatball and added pesto and it was amazing. Great service! I will be back for sure as their menu has a little bit of everything. PB and J cookies were a great dessert also"}
{"text":"Ike's is unreal. After one bite you'll agree that it's the best sandwich you've ever had. A sandwich goes for over $10 but it's worth it because it's 2 meals, it's a big sandwich. Get the Dutch crunch bread!

Mill ave. is having a huge resurgence and Ike's is a big part of it."}
{"text":"Holy cow...if anyone likes a good Sandwhich def come to this joint....great selection with a different special every week, great slection of chips and amazing service...after about 10 min of deciding, I went with the \"Vernon Davis\" while my friend went with \"The Bella\" ...went 1/2 and 1/2...they were UNREAL...prices nothing crazy but definitely not cheap...regardless some of the best sammies I've ever had !!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try ikes because of their vegan sandwiches.. but I doubt we will be back.
First, the guy taking our order clearly wasn't educated on what vegan is. I wouldn't nornally mind except they literally have a vegan and vegetarian menu so I would expect the staff to know how important it is to be precise. 
Second, they almost put \"veggie bacon\" on my boyfriends sandwich he asked to be made vegan, lucky that we asked because \"veggie\" bacon has egg in it proving my first point.
Third, the fillings for the sandwich was minimal at best. I felt like I was at Jimmy John's. All bread and little fillings for $11 each? I'll pass. 
Final complaint, why are we still using iceburg lettuce? and make sure your avocados are at least ripe before adding them to a sandwich. They tend to be rather hard when they aren't ripe."}
{"text":"I have tried multiple sandwiches here.  The Jay mee sirewich is amazing with avacado.  The staff is great.  If your adventurous try the bear hug amazing."}
{"text":"Love your Sammie's, love your staff; but you guys mess something up EVERYTIME I come in. Nothibg big enough to complain about(I hate complaining, I've worked food service..) but enough times to write a yelp review. This time you switched the bread types, not a big deal.. last time you made the wrong one vegan.. what ever, I just ate the other one. Couple of times you didnt start my Sammie's till I get there when I called 20 mins in advanced, but cmon guys! See you next week."}
{"text":"The food is good. The sandwiches are creative. However, the place is really expensive! Took family there and spent almost 60 bucks for sandwiches."}
{"text":"Vegan options here! Their vegan meatball is soooo good, I could have ate two!! Also love that they allow you to bring your own cup for those trying to not create so much waste."}
{"text":"Good stuff!! I have been to the one in Az and San Fran. My preference is the Matt Cain on Dutch.. This location is a lot bigger and you can actually eat inside. The sandwich board is huge but it's good stuff. I will say the Dutch tastes better in San Fran."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place! This food is the bomb! I would drive 100 miles to eat here! Well worth the time to come here, especially during happy hour from 4-7 everyday."}
{"text":"Really excited about this place, love the variety and unique sandwich focus. I will go back to try again but was not happy with my first visit. Could have been me that missed something but I ordered the turkey and cranberry (after telling the person taking our order that it was our first time there). They asked if I wanted lettuce and tomato and I said no. When I got my sandwich it was completely coated in a garlicy butter sauce - I don't like garlic. This was the 'dirty sauce', which was listed on the board on other sandwiches, but not this one. I tried to scrape the sauce off, but it was so heavily coated, it was not possible. I'd love to try the sandwich without it and would recommend that they explain the dirty sauce to new-comers. My husband had the Philly and loved it!"}
{"text":"Visited this spot while in Phoenix visiting family. I have been a huge fan of Ike's and I always try to hit one up when they are around. This specific location is great, I have had good service from the same employee twice now and the food is always on point. 

I like this location especially because unlike my usual location in West LA they serve their amazing french fries! Being the french fry lover I am this is always a important aspect of any dining experience haha :)

If you love sandwiches and are vegetarian this spot is great, check one out of they are near you."}
{"text":"I went to this place with high expectations, maybe a little too high because I was let down big time. The sandwich didn't have a lot a meat, it was loaded down mostly with lettuce and their dirty sauce which was coming out of every side of the sandwich so didn't matter what kind of meat you got in your sandwich everything taste like dirty sauce. The meat was along the lines of a subway as far as quality and was overpriced. The customer service is great and that's why I'm leaving a 2 star instead of a 1 but I will never go back with sandwich places like Firehouse Subs around. I'm more into quality than quantity."}
{"text":"I've been a frequent customer at Ike's so I figured id write a review. This place is very solid for sandwiches, what makes this place unique is the different variety of sandwiches and topping on them. I have had probably. 5 to 6 different sandwiches and the bear hug being my favorite. The staff is nice and friendly and the place is nice and clean. The only drawback is the sandwiches are a little pricey. Now granted this place blows away jimmy johns, subway, or jersey mikes but it's about double the price! Overall if you want something different, try this place cause where else can you get jalapeño poppers, chicken tenders, or mozzarella sticks on a sandwich!"}
{"text":"I liked Ike's sandwiches because the bread was good and it stayed a good texture even after a day. I had the Julius Ceasar, and thought that it was very tasty. I think that the sandwich tasted better because of the ceasar dressing. Without the ceasar dressing it might have been a bit plain, but they have more flavorful sandwiches on the menu that I could have selected. The sandwich seems a bit pricey because usually there are quite a few sandwich places that seem to be $5, but I really thought that their bread was good, the ceasar dressing was nice, and the sandwich was well-made. They also gave me an apple caramel lollipop too, which I thought was a nice touch."}
{"text":"They would not accept my student insider coupon through the phone. Expensive for college students! Sandwiches are ok."}
{"text":"The best Sandwich(es) ever..... . This is a rare Vegetarian's Paradise as well. After settling for lettuce, spinach, bell peppers and tomatoes on a roll with deli mustard or a not so nice tasting \"veggie burger\" countless times in this century- here comes Ike's to save the day and keep Veggie and Vegan hope alive, well and coming back for more. At the grand opening party on Friday 4/18, their amazing employee Rachel asked for my preference and had the #61 called the \" Sometimes I'm a Vegetarian\" specially prepared for me. First bite and I was hooked: Grilled Mushrooms,Marinated Arichoke Hearts, Pesto and Provolone on their delicious Dutch Crunch Bread. I have been back 4 times since and also ordered  #73, the \" Lynda Carter\" with Breaded Eggplant, French Dressing, Avocado and Gouda on that very same Dutch Crunch bread - wow! just crazy good. Next on my list is #70 \" Meatless Mike\" and my fantastic journey through the100 different veggie sandwiches. Love the awesome, fresh and hot sandwiches, love the atmosphere and vibe and especially love the energy and attitude of all of their employees. Customer for life here who is bringing 12 of his dear friends to this gem this weekend. Thanks Ike"}
{"text":"I ran into Ike himself here on my very first time! How many franchise owners actually visit all of their locations? What a cool guy.

Both times I've been to Ike's, I was blown away by the friendly, polite, and helpful staff. They obviously love working here and are experts on the massive menu. They don't get overwhelmed by the lunch rush, or when people come in right before closing time. They're truly professional, and that's not something you'd necessarily expect at a sandwich place.

THANK YOU for carrying gluten-free bread! A big extra thank you because the bread is delicious and substituted at no extra charge! Whatever you get, it'll probably taste heavenly. Ike's has my heart 100%, and I will never get a sandwich anywhere else. Why would I?

P.S. They cater! So instead of coming in with a huge group, do everyone a favor and have them cater for your company."}
{"text":"Blew my mind! Just landed from SF and was looking for a local place instead of a chain and I wanted something vegetarian. Happened to stumble in here and was blown away by an entire row of the craziest veggie sandwiches I've seen. And Jessie, the girl helping me, was so damn passionate. The energy added a ton. After taking about 10 minutes to get out of massive decision fatigue, I went with the 'Sometimes I'm a Vegetarian' with the works on their homemade Dutch crunch roll. Wow. Can't wait to try the original in San Francisco!"}
{"text":"Love their Dutch crunch bread. Sandwiches are a bit fatty so some ppl should ask for less sauce on theirs. Love the variety as well"}
{"text":"Get ready to go to sandwich heaven. It doesn't bother me at all to say that The best sandwich I've ever eaten in my 29 years was at Ike's. With endless combinations, pre recommended Sammie's, and veggie sandwiches you're sure to find something you'll love. The Dutch crunch bread was outstanding, it almost makes the sandwich. I would highly recommend this to any veteran sandwich connoisseur or anybody just looking for good eats, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is da bomb!! If you are looking for a flavorful sandwich you've got to check out Ike's. The staff is super friendly and patient."}
{"text":"Drove all the way from Queen Creek, discussing which sandwich to try on this next to last day of my spring break only to find a little paper on the window \"Sorry for the inconvenience. Closed\"... Be a loooonnnggg time before I'll make this trip. Hello Steve's in Phoenix."}
{"text":"There is a reason why this sandwich place has 5 stars. There are a ton of original sandwich creations to save you from submarine boredom. The bread is \"par\" baked (as in partially) and then finished baking to order so it comes out fresh and fabulous. There are a ton of vegetarian and vegan options if that floats your boat, and their website makes it easy to find them with their search filter. The staff was almost frighteningly friendly--not as intrusive as Dutch bros, but still oddly happy to see you, and chomping at the bit to walk you through the menu. During \"happy hour\" kettle chips and a drink are free if you eat in...it's not alcohol but it's a nice perk. It may come on the cheap to them because they have their own brand of soda pop instead of being slaves to Coca-Cola or appearing cheap with Pepsi, but their brand was sufficient to my taste buds. Don't feed the subway monster, check out Ike's--they really do love their sandwiches!"}
{"text":"The meatless mike is pretty serious...like I'm a 5'2 petite gal and that's a big ol sandwich but it's so delicious that I put the entirety of the sandwich into my body (and then had a food coma). I have done this same process at least 10 times..I'm in love and I don't care who knows it! Missing you in FL- xoxo your biggest fan, Alex."}
{"text":"AMAZING!! What an excellent selection of sandwiches. Finding a variety of vegan offerings in one place is difficult and Ike's delivers.  Sandwiches are large fresh and delicious.  Air baked fries are an awesome side.  This will definitely become our go to sandwich location."}
{"text":"Delicious, delicious, delicious!!!! Hit the spot.  Love the Dutch bread as it was super fresh."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best sandwich shop in Tempe. The dutch crunch bread is UHHMAZING. There are more than 500 different options on the menu, but for your convenience, they have their few best listed on a menu board. The chicken in their sandwiches are halal and there are tons of vegetarian options. I had the privilege of meeting Ike himself and he was such a boss haha! Amazing guy and so down to earth. I don't know if I've ever seen the owner himself work in the kitchen before. The happy hour from 4-7 pm gives you free chips and a drink with your sandwich. 

My favorite sandwiches are MILF, menange a trois, Phil Mickleson, and the Reuben. So so so good."}
{"text":"I'm in love with Adam Richman--The SANDWICH, I mean.  My wife and I have never had a bad experience here.  Their Gluten-Free Bread is probably the best I've had.  It would be nice if they had vegan chicken that was gluten free, but that's about it when it comes to downsides on this place.  If you're in the mood for a sandwich, go to Ike's.  They've got hundreds of options.  The staff is always fun, happy, and helpful.  The tables and booths are pretty clean.  The sandwiches are well worth the price you pay."}
{"text":"I tried Ike's for the first time during Temple's Art Festival earlier this year. They were outside giving out samples. I sampled the Ménage a trois, the MILF and the Barry Bonds sandwiches. They were all to die for. I promised to check them out again for the real experience the next time I was in Tempe. 

That time came this past Saturday. Undecided on dinner I knew I wanted a Slickables ice cream sandwich. \"Sandwich\" made me want a real sandwich so to Ike's we went. My boyfriend ordered the Menage a Trois (Halel chicken, BBQ sauce, honey, Swiss and pepper jack cheese).  I ordered the Tony Soprano (ham, turkey, salami, provolone and Italian dressing). We both had our sandwiches on the whole wheat. The whole wheat rolls are soft, kinda sweet and divine!! 

In our bags were 2 little extra surprises, 2 green apples and caramel lollipops. What a treat! I already have a whole list of sandwiches I'm dying to try: 

The Julius Cesar, The Matt Cain, The Paul Reuben, and the Steph #CurryOne 

Til next time Ike's"}
{"text":"I have eaten here once. Had great  customer service, endless options and food was SOOOOO good but WAY overpriced. 2 sandwiches for over $20 without a drink or side. No thanks. Probably won't come here again for a while which is a shame."}
{"text":"This is my second time chosing Ikes, this is because the sandwhich I got, called the \"Reggae Jackson\" was delicious!
 The cashier, named Tucker, was great, giving me the experience that I wasnt just another customer, instead, he showed that he truly appreciated that I chose to eat at Ikes.
The employees appear to truly enjoy their job. The enviroment vibe was great. This being my second time at Ikes, the cashier Tucker, said \"welcome back\". Im definitely eating at Ikes again"}
{"text":"This is definitely a plate to visit if you're craving a massive sandwich. So many unique options for carnivores and vegetarians as well! My favorite is definitely the ménage a trois. Mmmm honey and barbecue sauce on a sandwich, didn't think it would be a likely combination but it's actually delicious. The employees are always super friendly, nice, just overall cool atmosphere. I love the Carmel apple lolipop that comes with each sandwich."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews online and gasp- seeing good vegan sandwiches- I knew I had to check this place out. They make it super convenient for you to order online or by phone. I tried the \"Sometimes I'm a Vegan\" gluten-free sandwich. DELICIOUS. Can't wait to go back. I'm going to try and make this a once-a-week thing. I definitely recommend it. Very laid-back atmosphere and friendly, accommodating staff. Plenty of options for everyone too. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"A coworker and I decided to try Ike's for lunch for the the first time on Monday. The sandwiches we delicious. She tried the Barry B and I had the Your favorite Sesame Street character. We both loved our sandwiches. Our only compliant is we wish they had an option for a smaller sandwich. I don't think sandwiches keep well as leftovers, and tried to eat the whole thing so it wouldn't go to waste. I couldn't quite finish and I was still stuffed. I will try to get someone in the office to split one with me next time we order. Staff was also super friendly."}
{"text":"I used to work at an Ike's in California so I'm well versed in their sandwich menu and offerings. It's nice to see how that has transitioned to Mill Avenue and the craziness it offers. My go to order is a Pilgrim with Extra Dirty, Lettuce Tomato, and Mozzarella sticks. You'll want to get he Voodoo chips if you want a tangy flavor to contrast with your sandwich. I love Ike's selection but what most people don't know is that their menu is much longer. They have something like 200 different ones on their website. My only wish for this location is a Binder in which I can sort through other sandwiches like we had in the store I used to work at. Otherwise it's as much Ike's as any other location, quality is their game."}
{"text":"OMG. My son went to Ike's in California and we found out that they were here in Mesa. Got the Count of Monte Chase-o and the Chris Jericho and we split them. Awesome!  Will be a regular here."}
{"text":"Alright, my final verdict is in after my third visit here. I remain at three stars and here is why:
(1) The food has left a funky after taste each time I have been here and a somewhat funky feeling in my stomach. Now I'm not claiming it has made me sick, just feeling a little weird, like I ate some of Aunt Carrol's Christmas surprise casserole and just knew I felt different afterwards.
(2) 12 doll hairs for one sandwich, no chips, no drink, just the sandwich. 12 doll hairs is good for a decent steak, two sides, bread and peanuts at Texas Roadhouse.  
(3) This doesn't really equate in the rating but I sure notice it each time  and that is the most absurd logo I have ever seen, to the point of annoyance. Some fat bald head with this shitty grin and sole patch to boot, starring at you, I would have hired an actual professional when conceptualizing that one. I can totally picture the formation of the idea...\"I want my giant grill to be plastered all over to be associated for the good of sandwich kind every where...\"
(4) The chips are nasty
(5) The dutch crunch bread is kind of odd, I will try another bread if I ever come back, not all its cracked up to be

The latest sandwich I had was the Pat Tillman and I would certainly prefer it over the other two I have had. I also tried out the dirty sauce this time and while it seemed pleasant enough, I believe it compounded the a fore mentioned funky after taste quite a bit.     

All in all, not a bad sandwich (minus the after taste) but I can't really see myself coming here on a regular basis. However, I would not hesitate to bring someone here that may be visiting and has never had it before so the can experience the fat bald head for themselves oh and the sandwiches."}
{"text":"Walked in on a random notice of the shop with ravaging hunger.  The inside was nicely put togehter, despite the FILTHY air registers on the ceiling. The menu looked good but seemed quite pricey for a sandwich. (Even thought they were all named after celebrities) In a customer empty shop,  we noticed 5 employees, which was unusual. I asked what \"godfather\" and the other wierd named sauces were and specifically requested they be left off both of 2 sandwiches   A $29.00 bill was quite a surprise for 2 sandwiches and 2 fountain drinks and a micro-bag containing ~6 potato chips.  The sandwiches arrived about 10 minutes later, (yes 10 minutes in an empty shop)  and had that heavy thick garlic sauce all over them both. The food was decent, but for the cost and lack of attention to detail, I say go elsewhere or make it yourself.  It's just a freakin' sandwich, nothing new or innovating. In retrospect we should have gone to Barro's as originally planned."}
{"text":"I am from Phoenix, moved to the Bay Area 7 years ago... I have only been to Ike's in California, but I am sooooo excited they opened one in my home state. They're sharing the love!  
The sandwiches are incredible. The selection is extensive and they can make things vegetarian/vegan style if you request. You even get a caramel apple lollipop in your meal (I hope they do this in AZ). 
Don't hesitate - RUN to Ike's and get the best sandwich of yo' life!"}
{"text":"I thought I stumbled caloric heaven when I realized an Ikes was in Tempe during my brief visit. I went to the one in San Francisco and this dished out equally awesome food. I had the Thanksgiving turkey sandwich and tomorrow I will be back. Super fresh and flavorful.  Prices are very fair for the quality and ample size.  

Few places match Ikes in terms of sandwiches and its way better than the mainstream chains.  Find it if your in town and loosen the belt buckles."}
{"text":"i'm glad i did some research before going here... i found a sandwich on a \"secret\" menu that is to die for. i mean, who would think of putting fried mozzarella and fried jalapeno poppers on a sandwich? totally artery clogging goodness. with vegan meatballs and marinara sauce. it's called \"the bowser\" and i'll definitely be back for that one. and checking out more. the cashier was super helpful and cheerful."}
{"text":"First time here and words can't express how happy my stomach is. So flavorful and tasty. Got the Madison Bumgarner and Barry Bonds. The MadBum honey is strong but agrees with the BBQ wonderfully. Barry Bonds is simple and satisfying. Love to see the taste of Northern California here in AZ. Will be back much more! Go Giants!"}
{"text":"I don't understand why the Dutch crunch bread was recommended. It was like some drunken college student pulled out super stale, crumbly bread and threw random soggy ingredients on it. Not good. Especially for a $10 sandwich. Boo."}
{"text":"Awesome sandwich place in downtown Tempe. I actually had been meaning to try this place in Northern California but didn't get a chance while I was there. Was super pumped to find this in Arizona. It's in a fantastic location. 

It's a little overwhelming going there for the first time because there are so many options to choose from. Ultimately, I chose the Bear sandwich after asking the worker a million questions and prioritizing my favorite sandwich fillings. The Bear was freakin amazing and I can see why people are obsessed with this place. The sandwich had jalapeño poppers, jalapeños, prime rib, garlic aioli (dirty sauce), mushrooms, Baked french fries, served on Dutch crunch bread.

We went during happy hour so we got free chips and a drink...so that was an added bonus. I definitely recommend this place--friendly and fast service, decent prices for a ton of food, and a fun atmosphere. Probably best for lunch though."}
{"text":"Usually the subs are a good size. For some reason today you can tell the sandwiches had a portion cut from it. I'm not sure if this is/was a regular practice but they all seem smaller and I have been to this location a few times. 
Maybe because this ONE time I didn't tip and they got pissed?"}
{"text":"Three of us from work went to Ikes today for lunch.   It was the first time there for all of us.  The number of sandwiches is overwhelming.  I had the Lynda Carter which is breaded eggplant,  avocado,  gouda and French dressing.  It was delicious.  My co-workers also loved their sandwiches.  The staff is very helpful and friendly and it is a fun place to eat.  Will definitely be back.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Love Ike's Sandwiches, their huge menu and separate veggie section with lots of vegan options is amazing! I don't particularly like this location because they have a storefront but it's always closed so you have to go to the order out window and sit outside. I've been there in the summer so it's been super hot outside. Don't know if they are renovating but everything looks good inside so not sure why it's not open. I ordered Pirates of the Caribbean and it was really good. Always order on Dutch crunch bread and they make a vegan version of their dirty sauce and will even give you a blow pop instead of a caramel apple lollipop if you tell them you're vegan. Love Ike's and that it's expanding. Can't wait for the indoor seating to be available at this spot. Highly recommend, my favorite sandwich spot."}
{"text":"It's a part of my job to pick up incentives for ASU so one of the incentives I had to pick up was from here. Then I saw the menu. and OMG IT'S HUGE. Upon seeing it I decided to come back the next day when I got paid. I got the Love Triangle and it was delicious. The staff was really friendly but it took almost twenty minutes to get my sandwich. So that's one draw back since I was the only one there. I say if you eat here take it to go because the dining room is really small. People are saying it's expensive but I think it's worth it for the giant sandwich you get. Almost every sandwich could be made vegetarian if you want too. Good Options and Good food. I will definitely be back. Probably not on lunch break though, it's too far to walk in the arizona sun XD"}
{"text":"Amazing- always, but I have to agree with other recent reviews that the service seems to have gone down a bit...the place was dirty, tables not wiped down, the floors dirty. It's not like there was a long line, so just some advise to the counter girl...when no one is in line, this is the time to grab a rag and get busy. As for the food, never a disappointment. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Hold the dirty sauce & the sourdough. Okay, let me explain. So I went with the wife and we got two different sandwiches. I got the Bear Hug on sourdough and she got the Thunderbird on the dutch-crunch. The Thunderbird comes with thunderbird sauce. It is so good, you could taste all the parts; pastrami, gouda, & thunderbird sauce. The thunderbird sauce has a little kick to it, which is why I prefer it. And now let us discuss the dutch-crunch bread, it is a little sweet so the thunderbird sauce goes on that sandwich in perfect harmony. 

Then we get to my sandwich. :-( The sourdough was great and I am sure the dirry-sauce is good (I had already got blown away by the thunderbird sauce) but the sandwich has way to much going on in it. Roast beef, jalapeno poppers, lettuce, & some other yummy stuff in there I can't even remember. 

Because they will pretty much make any kind of sandwich you want, I want to try meatball, gouda, lettuce, with thunderbird sauce on dutch-crunch bread. I believe it will be \"out of this world\". In fact Ike, here's a new sandwich and title for you.

One sandwich can pretty much fill two normal appetites up. Unless you are like me, a ravenous creature. Get one and share ot get one for two-three meals. 

This place is overwhelming, but a must. The staff is great two. Be patient when ordering, certain orders require them to go in the back and yell an order to a cook. Remeber hundreds have survived this, there is no reason why you can't."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches. kind of expensive for a sandwich but it was pretty good. The logo looks like a young, hip mr. clean. the people that work there were nice people."}
{"text":"We came here because they advertised sandwiches that could be made with meatless meats. We got the \"meatball\" sub and Steve Jobs. They were both VERY delicious! The only negative is the cost of about $10 each sub."}
{"text":"Out of the 3 columns of food on the board, a third of it is dedicated to veggie sandwiches and they can all be turned into a vegan sandwich. Awesome.
 I got the meatless Mike  (imitating a meatball sandwich). They also have a \"hangover\" special on Saturday and Sunday for ten bucks. This kind of feels like the perfect place for a COOL health conscious college kid (or a vegan college kid). I'll be coming back for sure to try out other items. I used to eat meat, so i really appreciate it when substitutes taste like meat or have similar texture, and this one definitely passed the test. The sandwich itself I ordered with tomato, lettuce, jalapeños, red onion, banana peppers, and paid the extra for avocado. (Avocado was worth it, it wasn't smooshy, and it was a good portion size). It was delicious, not overly salty, not mushy, and very satiating. This probably will scoot its way into my top 10 vegan restaurants of the valley. Highly recommend. (A side plus: because it's not 100 percent vegan you can come with those meat eating friends and they can't complain!)"}
{"text":"As a couple others have already pointed out, this is a chain based in San Francisco, not a local business - but still definitely a neat and tasty sandwich shop.

I've been twice. The first time, the cashier took a couple minutes to walk me through the menu and make recommendations. I had a Sundevil (American cheese, fried chicken, and spicy sauce) on sourdough (they'd run out of Dutch Crunch for the day). Good chicken, good bread, good sauce... all around, a pretty good experience. The second time, I got a bacon and egg sandwich on Dutch Crunch. I'm a sucker for all things breakfast, and not at all hard to please; that said, I thought this was a pretty good sandwich too. Bread was rich and crunchy, bacon was plentiful... the egg was a little rubbery, but not bad.

The only thing that might keep me from returning is the price. Most sandwiches will run you about $10 (a bit less for a half), and while they're definitely good, I'm undecided about whether they're $10 worth of good."}
{"text":"This is the best place to get sandwiches, hands down! Their menu is HUGE, but the best part if that they have GLUTEN FREE bread and do not upcharge for it (Please note that the sandwiches are warmed in a shared oven.) The sandwiches are not cheap, think $9 - $14, but every bite is worth it."}
{"text":"I had the M.I.L.F and it was the shit!! I split it with my lunch date for half of his Menage-A-Trois which was even better! If you haven't checked this sammy place out yet you need to!! They have over 100 different sandwiches, a kids menu, huge vegetarian selection and breakfast sandwiches! They bake the bread to order and add this sauce that is delicious the whole vibe just rocks;I have found a new sammich heaven!!!"}
{"text":"Love this spot. There are endless vegetarian options.  I recommend this to anyone vegetrarian or not."}
{"text":"Exactly as advertised. If you like the menu your gonna feel right at home. Diet and regular RC cola was a little surprise. Interesting place if you're looking for something different."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a quick bite during lunch. I had the Matt Cain on Dutch crunch bread. It was delicious. The sandwich came out pretty quickly and everyone who worked there was nice. Overall, great experience and I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"This is a nice little place at Brickyard which you should definitely try. They have a variety of options for vegetarians as well, wasn't disappointed with the taste either. A bit pricey though."}
{"text":"Hell yes! I love this place. First tried it in SF and was ecstatic to learn they were opening a location in Mesa (and very soon in Tempe!) The menu is giant! Look online before you go. I get the Barry B, my gf likes the Spiffy Tiffy. Don't skip the dirty sauce and although they're famous for the Dutch crunch bread, I opt for the Sourdough because it's phenomenal.

Fries are great, onion rings tasted great but I made the mistake of taking them home and they ended up a bit soggy. Obviously not their fault but just a warning to those who want to take out onion rings.

I can't tell if they moved I to a struggling shopping center or if all the restaurants around them closed because Ike's is so awesome.

I have been here 4 times now and will continue to drive 15 minutes for my new favorite sandwich shop!"}
{"text":"This place has the best sandwiches in town pretty much, for their variety, quality, taste, and the fresh ingredients used.

They are very friendly and have a great customer service.

This location has a happy hour with free chips and drinks between 3PM and 7PM every weekday, as well as whole of Sunday.

The veggie Jeanine sandwich is probably the best veggie I have tried in a while. Plus they have nice salmon and tuna sandwiches apart from the meat ones. They also give you gluten free bread at no extra charge.

This is the place to go, hardly any complaints."}
{"text":"We had gone to Mill Avenue and were walking around when we saw a couple of people from Ike's who were serving sample sandwich bites. My boyfriend & I each got one & thought they were absolutely delicious so we decided to go in for lunch. Ike himself was there! He was really nice and talked to us for quite a while.

After a look over the menu, we got the Sometimes I'm a Vegetarian sandwich. It had grilled mushrooms, artichokes, cheese, and pesto. The sandwich was massive, and even though we shared it, both of us were full. My only complaint was that I don't typically care for artichokes but it was a little bit annoying that they had put whole pieces of them in the sandwich. The best part was definitely the pesto sauce and their house bread! It was fantastic.

I had sampled another sandwich called the Menage A Trois. It was also really tasty, and I'd definitely recommend that if you're looking for something that isn't vegetarian. Although I'm not vegetarian, I really liked the Sometimes I'm a Vegetarian sandwich & thought the name was really clever for that very reason.

Ike's is a bit on the expensive side, however, it's great sandwich place if you're on Milll Ave! I'd recommend splitting a sandwich with someone if you go. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ted Danza is what did me in, my coworker told me to try Ike's, so I brought my other friend along and we loved it, the Dutch Crunch is the best! They also have some local soda which are terrific, the cream soda actually had honey in it. The Thunderbird is great too, but if you are starting out here get the Ted Danza sandwich."}
{"text":"This place is UNIQUE. What's unique about it? DEFINITELY that dutch crunch bread. It's just so irresistibly satisfying. All their sammiches have awesome, funny names. The halal chicken is delicious, I always get the threesome sandwich... lol. It's fucking delicious. It's just such an overall great vibe. 

Trust me on this one... go check it out! 

Oh and it's not like just this location is good and the rest suck. No they ALL are good across the valley! Treat yo-self!"}
{"text":"The categories for this place are technically correct but not fully representative. They certainly have plenty of \"healthy\" options and vegetarian and vegan sandwiches, but they have plenty of \"unhealthy\" ones as well :) I only say that because it gives choices for everyone involved.

Their sandwiches are solid and tasty. The choices are slightly overwhelming in a good way and the menu is fun to read with the names for the sandwiches. I got the Ted Danson which was a play on a turkey ruben without the grilled bread. Got the Dutch Crunch bread which I recommend.

The service is friendly and fast and the place clean. Good for families. The side orders were not as up to par - had the onion rings and fried zucchini - but were not bad. I'd certainly go here again but it isn't \"transcendent\" where I have to go back immediately."}
{"text":"Thank you goes to two of my co-workers for recommending this hidden gem. I had Jake the snake with Dutch crunch roll bread. Amazingly good!! I can't wait to come back so many choices. I look forward to Ike's sandwiches- by far the best sandwich shop."}
{"text":"Ike's is a fun little sandwich chain in the west.   I was hoping it wasn't a franchise, but it is.  It didn't really change the deliciousness level of the sandwiches, but the price was significantly higher than what I'm used to paying for a sandwich.   Most sandwiches are over $10.  Either way, this place has over 600 options to choose from, funny sandwich names, and a chill college atmosphere.      Pro tip: check in on Yelp and get your free bag of chips!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic sandwich! I ordered the mothers day special which was entitled the Cougar. Chicken mozzarella strips Franks hot sauce and ranch dressing served on their eyes were famous Dutch crunch French bread. My son says that there are over 500 sandwiches on the menu but they only list about 50 on their displayed menu."}
{"text":"Love Ike's sandwiches!  Never a complaint there... Too good.

However I have called in and used the order now found on their Yelp Page.  Both times I ordered 30 minutes prior to picking up my food.  Both times, including today, no one started to make my sandwich until I got there.  

I don't understand the reason for the delay, but it can be very frustrating when you want to just pick up and run.  Today I picked up at a slow time at 1:45 and it still wasn't started until I arrived.  Beyond frustrating."}
{"text":"This place is among my favorites as far as sandwich places are concerned. They have about 30+ sandwiches to choose from but you're free to come up with your own combo as well. They have free chips and drinks during happy hour. The only reason I'm giving it a 4 out of 5 stars is because of the music choices, which is primarily rap and hip hop. I really hate to be narrow minded but I'm really not a fan of those genres. With that being said, the music won't deter me from sitting down and shoving a delicious sandwich in my face. My favorite one is the Paul Ruebens with lettuce, tomato and add provolone."}
{"text":"The menu is chaotic but fun, with a multitude of vegetarian options. A little on the pricy side for subs and definitely not worth the price for the sides. The subs themselves are fantastic and whimsical. Leaps and bounds above anything you could get at competitors."}
{"text":"I live in Tucson, but every time I come to Phoenix I make sure to eat at Ike's. The first thing I noticed during my first visit was how extraordinary the service as (and this isn't even a dine-in place). The guy behind the counter greeted us genuinely and everyone else working seemed happy to be there. After we put in our order, we ended up talking to the cashier for like 30 more minutes! Every interaction is genuine and enthusiastic, which is really something unique. 

And goodness...the sandwiches. I was so impressed with how many options there were for people of all different diets. Halal chicken, vegetarian, vegan, and plenty for meat lovers. The options are literally endless. The sandwiches are HUGE and make my heart happy. And to top it off, they give you free caramel apple lollipops! What an awesome little perk.

Overall, if you live in the Phoenix area you MUST try eating here."}
{"text":"They're 5 stars for a reason - great energetic atmosphere, best sandwich in a long, long time! Me and the Mrs.  Paid $4 more for our total meal over what a plain Jane Subw@y meal would have cost - for sandwiches that have FLAVOR and from people that CARE! 

Probably 80 sandwiches to choose from, gluten free if you want, vegan if you want, carnivore if you want. Crunchy Dutch roll-only ones outside of San Francisco  to have them. 

EAT HERE! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Found this hidden gem the week they opened and have been coming back since. Friendly employees, napkin holders that mercilessly flirt with you, sandwiches that are so good you want to lick the paper they came on and atmosphere is adorable!"}
{"text":"Today was my husbands and I first time in tempe and we decided to try IKES needless to say we were truly amazed all around the young lady at the cash register provided exceptional customer service and the food alone was fantastic very friendly staff and I would certainly go there again!"}
{"text":"Had both Stephan Jenkins and Bear Hug (on separate occasions). These are way too big to eat on your own! High quality meat. Love the pesto and dirty sauce aswell as the many options available. Opened my eyes to a lot of different sammich combinations! Price is alright, but definitely worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Just traveling through on our vacation (SF Giants Spring Training) and spotted Ike's.  I know Ike's from the Bay Area, and this did not disappoint.  I got the Vegetarian and my husband got the Menage a Trois with Halal Chicken. Both sandwiches knocked our socks off!  Seriously, how good can a sandwich be?  So good!  Totally recommend.  They obviously take their sandwiches very seriously!  I will always go here when I visit Scottsdale!  (Go Giants!)"}
{"text":"My love of Ike's knows no bounds. It is my favorite sandwich place in the country, and I'm so happy we have another location in Arizona. I stopped in the Mill Ave store to get a quick bite before a show at Gammage. I brought my friend who was new to Ike's because I insist on spreading his sandwich gospel.

I decided to get the ASU-exclusive Kate Spade with added avocado. The Sundevil sauce is delicious, kind of a kicky ketchup/BBQ taste. Service was good too.  Our cashier helped my newbie friend navigate the menu with his recommendations. 

Pro tip- Ike's makes a great breakfast the next morning if you pop the 2nd half of your sandwich in a toaster oven for 10-15 minutes."}
{"text":"I still love this place, but they've been out of many food items the last two times I've visited this month. No vegan chicken or meatballs on one visit, and they were out of Dutch Crunch today. That's the highlight of my sandwiches. They also said they were out of onions which is odd. Can't someone make a grocery store run?"}
{"text":"I am staying at a hotel close by for a few weeks and tried to come by Ike's about a week ago near lunch time and the place was so busy I didn't have time to wait. 

I made a second attempt and came around 2:30pm and scored a big success. Having a large appetite I went for the Bear Hug. I was drawn to it because one of the ingredients was jalapeño poppers which I am a huge fan of. I took the sandwich to go and ate it at the hotel. I was blow away by all of the amazing flavors and textures rolled into one. It is one of the best sandwiches I've ever had in my life. No joke.

Fantastic product!"}
{"text":"Fantastic sub joint on Mill Ave! Highly recommend this place especially if you are comparing it to other sub places. Ike's blows the others out of the water!"}
{"text":"BEST SANDWICH EVER! My Matt Cain with jalapeños and banana peppers was delicious. I'll be sure to trek out here sometime for another meal, and I'll be sure to bring anyone I'm with."}
{"text":"A good sandwich is pretty much all about the bread and this place has a great roll.  I tried the Tony Soprano on my first visit.  Anxious to try some others.  Very upbeat vibe.  I'll have to stick with carry-out since they don't serve Coke!"}
{"text":"The service is great. The girl at the counter was so excited that it was our first time trying the sandwich and promised that it was going to be the best we ever had. While it was a good sandwich, I can't say it was my favorite. I'm from LA, so we have an abundance of delicious and creative restaurants. However, I think Ike's is a great lunch spot, especially given that they have a vegetarian menu!"}
{"text":"Are you super hungry, want to eat something delicious, and just want to feel full and satisfied?! Look no further! These sandwiches will do just that!!!

Tucked away in a small strip right across fiesta mall you will find this yummy sandwich shop. The menu is endless and can be quite overwhelming as there is so much you can choose from. It was our first time there so we took our time and looked over the menu to see exactly what we wanted.

We ended up ordering one number 1/2, (Its the first one on the menu) one number 21, and a number 25. We also got a regular drink and an order of their air fries (employee informed us that the fries are not fried). All the sandwiches do have unique names and a number next to them. You can pick your bread (wheat or sourdough) and they have a vegetarian selection as well. 

Our total was close to $40, and the cashier was nice. 

We sat down and waited about 10 minutes. The employee brought out our food, and was friendly. 

The sandwiches are huge and are cut in half. My sandwich (#25) was amazing! It was turkey, avocado, and bacon on a sourdough bread. They definitely pack your sandwich with a ton of meat and enough veggies. You can add more toppings if you'd like for an additional cost!

I got to try the other sandwiches as well and they were just as delicious as mine was! OMG THE AIR FRIES WERE AMAZING!!! Piping hot and crispy, MMMMM. Will be back soon!

Check in on yelp and get a free bag of chips!

They have a kids menu!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Food selection was great. Tons of options and sandwich ideas. Big tip be very careful when selecting add ins they can make your $11 sandwich $18 real quick and grabbing a drink will make it a $20 meal..."}
{"text":"Really large menu and amazing yummy large sandwiches - wish I could eat these every day! You should definitely try it if you're reading this and on the fence - worth your time!!!"}
{"text":"I have one of these places in California and its fucking flame. I wish I could say the same about the Tempe location. My lettuce tasted old, and my sandwich fell apart. It just wasn't all there, I've had way better sandwiches from Danville CA."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I have family in Arizona for delicious restaurants like Ike's. The Bad Santa is what I order even if it's not in \"season.\" The country fried chicken is breaded and cooked crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside and then condiments bring it all together. Best sandwich!"}
{"text":"We stopped by here on the way to our gym. I've only been here a couple times and I can't remember what I ordered in the past. This time I ordered the Tony soprano. The Sandwich comes with salami, ham, turkey, Italian dressing, provolone cheese and it's under nine dollars. We ordered it on the Dutch crunch bread. It was amazingly delicious and comes toasted.  It also comes with their garlic dairy free sauce and is called the dirty sauce, along with lettuce and tomato. We decided to split a sandwich because we didn't want to be too full before working out. It was perfect for two people, we were not starving however and we also got a bag of chips because we checked in through Yelp. They also give you two lollipops for free, cute!"}
{"text":"I will not even try to explain the mess that this place is in great detail, and know it was hands down the worst overall experience I have ever had at any food establishment. I will never return.

**I was asked to edit this because of lack of detail. The lady served me a pickle sandwich because she said she could not find the buttons for the five other ingredients that it contained. She said she did not want to bother me with this issue, so just sent me on my way with the pickle sandwich. She offered to remake it when I came back, and the new sandwich was just brown soggy wet veggies with about a cup of hot sauce thrown on it."}
{"text":"I saw all the raves on here and I was like gotta try this place. It didn't do it for me. I think there was to much pesto on my sandwich. Plus it fell apart halfway through."}
{"text":"This place has amazing sandwiches, but when I look at my transaction history to find that my 26 dollar order turned into 48  dollars it makes things bad. Watch your transactions with this place."}
{"text":"Cool sandwiches. Had the Bella and tiffy spiffy. Very filling. Request them to add sriracha on the sandwiches. 
Jalapeño poppers make a good side with the Sandwiches"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and gluten free!   They are great with allergies and have a fun vibe!

The sandwhich was are delicious and the gluten free bread is thick and sturdy- hoagie style.  No crumbly udi's here!  

Order with their online app if you are in a hurry.  

We love it here!   My favorites are the monte chase o and coming home for thanksgiving!"}
{"text":"Does Tempe really need another sandwich shop? Well if that sandwich shop is Ike's then yes, yes they do.

Seriously good sandwiches. And one of the largest menu selections I've ever seen.

They have GF bread which is actually pretty good, if a little too large. They're good about CC as I've never been sick after eating here (or the one in Mesa).

Pro Tip: they have a happy hour from 4 - 7 which includes chips and a drink at no extra cost. Plus it's just fun to hear them shout \"HAPPY HOUR!\""}
{"text":"Literally any kind of sandwich you want; the classics, new twists on old classics, new freakish creations you didn't even know you wanted. Over 200 sandwiches!!! 

2 people with sandwiches, chips and drinks runs about $30. A little spendy, but the quality and taste is well worth it.

Be sure to go between 3-6 to hear them shout \"happy hour!\" and to get chips and a drink included with your sandwich."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for lunch one Saturday.  He kept going on about how good it was and I was skeptical at best because I'm not a sandwich person. 

Boy, was I wrong. 

This place is amazing. I'm a picky eater and had a lot of questions. The staff answered them eagerly and happily. I got the number 11 and it was the best sandwich I've ever had. Good food. Place was clean and welcoming. Staff was very helpful and even bagged my stuff up for me when I asked for a box. 

Two thumbs up, will definitely be coming here again!"}
{"text":"Ahhhhhhhhhmazing! Headed to the fams for Easter and thought hmmmm a sandwich sounds good. Thanks to yelp we found Ike's !!!! Their signature bread is so delicious as is their special sauce. Tried a roast beef salami one and the deep fried chicken with their BBQ honey sauce. Please start one in Washington. Also the workers were so happy and helpful! Can't wait to come back to Mesa!"}
{"text":"Incredible sandwiches! I've tried the Super Mario and the Madison Bumgarner. Both were amazing!"}
{"text":"Sandwiches are waaaaaaaaaay over priced and they were nothing special. Plus you gotta drive around for parking. Def rather go to potbelly"}
{"text":"Customer service is on point. Best Damn gluten free sub bread I've ever put in my mouth. First time here... definitely coming back and bringing the family with."}
{"text":"Just happened to be driving down the street and saw the goofy advertising of the Mr. Ike dude with his fancy smile and hairdo. Thought I was looking at an old TV commercial of Mr. Clean as a kid. Definitely got my attention and did a quick bookmark for this place.

I'm going to start right off with the fact that these guys make some really good sandwiches. They even make a great Gluten Free version for those who are on a special diet. This is a big reason for me rounding up and going Ape Woohoo on this here review.

Inside is charming with a simple pick what you want and we will make it to your specifications. They have a gigantic menu with a large majority of the sandwiches named after famous celebrities or TV characters. You can even order by number to keep things real.

Service is friendly and very helpful when it comes time to making your selection. On my first visit I felt overwhelmed by the menu and was ask a few question to narrow down my choices. Nice!

Ordered the Adam Richman on Dutch Crumble Bread for my first experience. That Man vs Food fool is crazy. The sandwich was delicious and came with Avocado, Fried Chicken, Ham, Pesto, Real Honey and Swiss. Next visit tried out the Pat Tillman which is Beer Battered Mozzarella Sticks, Mushrooms and Roast Beef.

My co-worker went with the Gluten Free version of the Spiffy Tiffy. It comes with Avocado, Halal Chicken, Mushrooms, Pepper Jack, Pesto, and Provolone. She said it was spectacular and the first sandwich she has been able to eat in a long time. Regular bread makes her feel poorly and she could not stop talking about how good it tasted.

They also have some crazy BIG sandwiches like the Kryptonite. That one comes with Avocado, Bacon, Beer Battered Onion Rings, EXTRA Pepper Jack, Ham, Mozzarella Sticks, Pastrami, Pesto, Roast Beef, Salami, Stuffed Jalapeno Poppers and Turkey.

Too many choices to list them all. Check out their website and give them a visit. The prices are a little higher than your typical sandwich places but well worth it. You will definitely notice the difference in the higher quality of ingredients as well as the freshness of the product. SHOW ME THE LOVE!

{"text":"We got our food to go and this place still has very good sandwiches. They did forget to include my French dressing on the side which hurt my ability to have a better sandwich. Otherwise, the onion rings were solid and large, the bag of chips was free with a check-in and since we arrived after 1pm, the wait for a sandwich was minimal. The only other issue is that there are some sandwiches on the printed menu that are not on the menu board which I discoved after I returned home."}
{"text":"Tried a new sandwich with good results - it was the Lynda Carter. I got the french dressing on the side. This one had baked breaded eggplant, avocado and gouda cheese with lettuce, onions and dirty sauce. All the flavors melded great and this sandwich was slightly healthier since it was not deep fried. It was about 10 bucks, but worthy of the price for once."}
{"text":"This place is still awesome.  Got sandwiches to go. 1. Going home for thanksgiving. .yum. 2. Chester the cheetah. .double yum. And 3. The damon bruce, since the husband must have steak
 
Service was fast and friendly,  easy to order. This place is classic!"}
{"text":"Having read many great reviews, my wife and I were excited to try Ike's but we were seriously disappointed. The sandwiches, a Matt Cain and a Meatless Mike, were just OK. And,  the price was simply too high for what you get.  Two sandwiches, a side of Jalepeno poppers and one drink was $25. Setting cost aside, the sauces overwhelmed the rest of the sandwich. The bread is better than average, however, not stellar. While we would not say this is a place to avoid, many seem to like it, we would not put Ike's on our recommended list.  The local grown Sacks Art of Sandwicherie would have to be our pick to click in the greater Phoenix area."}
{"text":"I  got to know that this sandwich shop originally hailed from SF - and the only location so far is out in Mesa.

Have to say - the size of these sandwiches were monstrous! Putting two halves together is a size I can't fathom! $10 for a sandwich that big - seriously?!?! Awesome deal I think.

The sandwich itself? Quite good! The sandwich bread was \"Dutch\" so quite crunchy but tasty at the same time. Vegetarians - there is a whole section devoted for us on the menu!! 

The bear hug was supposed to have vegan breaded chicken as the patty but since they were out of stock, ended up getting vegan turkey. I didn't really mind if it was chicken or turkey because at the end the soy products end up tasting the same. Have nothing to compare it to!

None the less, the sandwich was delicious and I loved the touch of stuffed jalapeño poppers in the bear hug sandwich! Wow!

To finish every sandwich meal, they throw in a caramel apple lollipop - sweet end to a large meal!"}
{"text":"Awesome to visit a place that doesn't just slap a wet roasted red pepper between to slices of bread and call it a day on their vegetarian menu development. Veg and vegan options are all superb and surprisingly filling."}
{"text":"Wife talked this place up! I would have gave 5 stars but for 2 things. The price was a little to high. But the sandwiches are very good. I can eat my fill. Even tho am only 163 pounds and 6 ft tall. This man needs food.! So when I go somewhere and spend money out and it be pricey I expect to get full. Not the case here. I ended up eating my whole sandwich and my wife felt so bad that she talked this place up and I was still hungry she gave me the other half of yours. So for the about of money spent and the amount of food. It's not worth. But the sandwiches are very good. So it's up to you!"}
{"text":"THE. BREAD. 

This is legit the best sandwich shop. The menu is a mile long and they have vegan options! I love the variety and creativity in this place. I've tried the Kate Spade, the Pilgrim and a vegan buffalo chik'n sandwich (forgot the name) and all have delivered with flavor. The portions are massive and it's worth it. I'll admit it can get pricey but you're paying for fresh food that is made to order and it's sooooooo tasty. Invest in the best and especially a small business like this. I've never been disappointed and I actually crave this place. Never a wait, super fast service and really great food. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"These sandwiches are addicting. When I used to be a fast food eater I would always go to Carl's Jr and get a western chicken sandwich. The bbq chicken sandwich they offer here is like crack to me. The fact that they have a convenient open outdoor seating makes it a great stop during my dog walks as well. I never thought I could love a sandwich this much."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches! Love the vegetarian options!! Homemade bread is amazing too! Friendly staff, quick service."}
{"text":"I really can't add more than what others have said. My daugher suggested this place and swore it was great- and it was! Super delicious! I had a Kevin Bacon (BLT and pepper jack cheese) I added jalapenos and it was Wonderful!  I wasn't crazy about their fried zucchini- but everyone else liked it, so it must be me and I don't want to knock them on my taste preferences. We also got a drink and chips included in happy hour. Are they a little bit more for a sandwhich? Maybe a little but we would spend the same amount at Firehouse with chips and drinks, so its not outrageous. I would suggest going to the website first to browse the menu- there are a ton of sandwhiches and it could take awhile to decide."}
{"text":"Great food, absolutely terrible service. The first few times I had Ike's I would have given a 6-star rating if I could, but after my last two experiences here it will be a long time before I step inside these doors again."}
{"text":"Sandwich was slightly below average. The shops in California are 10x better. I can taste the West Coast Love that is put into every sandwich back in California, whereas in AZ, I can taste the Zona hate. The lettuce was soggy, bread wasn't well maintained (as it fell apart in my delicate hands). I am not happy with the sandwich but the service was great. Would not definitely come back here again!!!!"}
{"text":"I was surprised that I hadn't written a review for this place.  I've been here at least a dozen times in the last year or so.

It's a great place, friendly staff, easy parking, convenient location, free refills on sodas.  I've really only had the Barry B which is a turkey/swiss/bacon sandwich because I ordered it the first time I came in and never changed.  

Their menu selection is just huge with lots of unique sandwiches.  Get the Dutch crunch bread with the crunchy, buttery top.  I think it's probably the best sandwich bread I've ever had.  Expect to pay about $10-$15 for a sandwich, chips and a drink.

Forgot to add:  I went in recently for their breakfast sandwiches.  Try The Hangover.  Eggs, your choice of meat, cheese, tater tots, and a really spicy hot sauce."}
{"text":"Great place and great food overall.

I usually don't hand out 5 starts but the sandwich was pretty damn good.  Really easy parking and access off the 60, friendly staff, massive menu, good seating, free refills, etc.

The bread I chose was the Dutch crunch which has a crunchy, buttery top that meshes well with the sandwich.  I chose the Barry B which has turkey, bacon, and Swiss cheese.  Really nice balance to everything.  The bread had a nice crunch on top but if soft on the inside so it doesn't feel hard.  

The sandwich and drink were $11 and change, plus I threw in a $1 tip.  I skipped the chips to save money and the sandwich was be enough to just eat half if you aren't very hungry.  I ended up eating the whole thing.

Like I said the menu is massive so you might want to take a look before going in there.  They also gave out a free caramel/apple sucker which was also damn good."}
{"text":"My Tips for you:
1. The menu can be overwhelming - ask the staff for recs.
2. If you aren't starving - split it with a friend, the portions are huge, that or do what I did and eat the whole thing, but just be in a food coma the rest of the afternoon 
3. Get dutch crunch for the bread. 
4. don't throw away your bag before checking to see if they didn't throw in some surprise lollipop inside, you'll be said when you've tossed yours and your friend's are enjoying their surprise candy dessert"}
{"text":"Menu was amazing! So much to choose from. Food was pretty good but not great. I really liked the bread. I got the Pat Tillman. Again, pretty good. I'll go again but will order something else"}
{"text":"My go-to sandwich place. My boyfriend and I come here at least once a week. I get the gluten free bread which is awesome, it's never made me sick. We actually met Ike a few weeks ago while he was there, super cool and nice guy. Stop by and try the Menage a Trois or Lizzy's Lips, my personal favorites!"}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches! The Dutch crunch bread is fantastic and the dirty sauce is too die for!! The halal chicken has great flavor! I tried the #98 with fried chicken and BBQ sauce and it was soooo good!!"}
{"text":"I had first heard of Ike's while watching a Man vs Food episode and had been wanting to try it ever since. I even it had it bookmarked for my next visit to San Francisco. I'm so glad I don't have to wait to visit San Fran to try these delicious sandwiches, since they have recently expanded to Phoenix. My first time here was at Yelp Community Event, where we were able to have a tasting menu of 4 different sandwiches. This was perfect for first timers as there's so many options to choose from. I chose from an experimental tasting menu, and my husband had the spicy tasting menu, so we were able to taste 8 different sandwiches all together. Every sandwich we tried was delicious. It's really hard to pick a favorite, the highlights were a buffalo chicken style sandwich, the Mozzarella's Big Cheese which had chicken and honey on it, the Carne Asada fries sandwich (which included just that) and the dessert sandwich of nutella and marshmallow fluff. There's a ton of substitutions available along with vegetarian and vegan options, and their bread is fresh as it's par-baked daily and then baked to order. The staff here is really passionate about their food and extremely nice and helpful. I will definitely return for Ike's amazing sandwiches."}
{"text":"A vegan happy place. I've been here probably ten times, and have been entirely pleased by my experience each and every time. I work in service, so I know that good food takes time, and I have never been disappointed by customer service. I tend to bring friends here every time I go, and the cashiers are always SO understanding of their confusion! A couple of tips: if you're wanting to order your sandwich completely vegan, make sure you specify! They have vegan dirty sauce, but if you just order off the vegetarian menu, they'll give you the real mayo dirty sauce. The wheat bread also is not vegan. They use Daiya cheese, so if you're not a fan, just get it without. I have been so pleased with every sandwich I've tried. Can't wait to get back!"}
{"text":"I usually get great service and great sandwiches from Ikes. Not so much the last time. I love Ikes so much that I ordered a meatless meatball sandwich to eat in and a meatless BLT sandwich to eat later. On my meatball sandwich to eat in I requested no lettuce or tomato. On my BLT sandwich to eat later I requested lettuce, tomato, and no Thunderbird sauce. When I got home, very excited to eat my BLT, I was pretty disappointed to find out that there was no L and there was no T.  But there was Thunderbird sauce. This is a testament to how much people listen anymore. The person heard the order for my first sandwich and assumed that it was the same exact order for my second sandwich, even though it was a completely different sandwich. Again, I usually love Ikes, but for $10 a sub I was pretty disappointed when I got home to find out that I only had a B, and not a BLT."}
{"text":"Ikes Ikes Ikes you make my day-ay. This is the third location that I've been to and I'm happy to say they're consistent with the food and great service. This location opened up two weeks ago and its kind of hidden. Its tucked in an area thats behind Mill Ave. It didn't take much time to find it, but I'm glad its hidden because only a few know about it so far. When you find it, the trip is totally worth it."}
{"text":"The first time I had Ikes was in downtown Oakland about a year ago. I have to say it was one of the most memorable sandwiches I ever had. I told everyone about the place as if I was the owner. I was working at a clinic about 5 miles away a few days ago, but had no idea that there was an Ikes Sandwich Shop in town. I'm never in this area because its been dead for years, but now I have reason to go there. I was planning on meeting my girlfriend at Chipotle for lunch. I pulled into the parking lot and saw Ikes off to the side. I was hyped!!! I immediately called her and told her to scratch Chipotle and do Ikes instead. We both got sandwiches and traded halves after I sampled hers. She ordered the gluten free bread and I have to say its the best I've had. The staff was excellent and made great recommendations. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"These sandwiches are SO GOOD.  They are huge and savory and filling.  It is difficult to stop at eating \"just half,\" for your tastebuds and tummy want the whole darn thing.  I ordered the Meatless Mike sandwich (vegan meatballs) and wow, those meatballs tasted better than \"real\" meatballs.  The bread was also great: fresh, soft where it had to be soft and just enough resistance in places to make you work for your food.  I also really liked the marinara sauce which is actually making my mouth water RIGHT NOW.  Some people may quibble about the slightly higher-than-expected sandwich prices (mine was $9.99 for something akin to a Subway footlong), but the quality of the ingredients, bread, and fantastic customer service are all worth the extra money.  You also get a caramel apple lollipop with your sandwich, which is da (sugar) bomb.  ;)  Check out Ike's for some serious sandwich magic."}
{"text":"I only discovered Ike's recently on Mill Ave and so far it's been a great spot for sandwiches. The location is somewhat hidden away behind the Bank of America ATM but I did a see a sign on Mill Ave to direct people there. I would have to agree with other people in that the sandwiches here are delicious! I'm not sure if I would consider them to be the best but they're definitely up there. So far I had the Menage A Trois and Steve Nash and they have been phenomenal. Somehow I'm not able to stray away from the Halal chicken just yet but the other sandwiches sound really good as well so I'll definitely have to give them a try sometime.

While I really enjoyed the sandwiches here and would give them an easy 5 star rating there are some minor issues about the restaurant. I just wish that the seating area was bigger and the tables that are used are just too small. In any case I will still come back here as the sandwiches are really good. Definitely one of the best spots on Mill Ave by far."}
{"text":"I typically loves ikes. But this was my first time at this location, not good at all. Two of the employees just sat on their phones while a huge group of customers walked in. Gentleman is at the counter asking where he can order and the employee has his phone in his hand looks at the customer and then looks back at his phone. The young girl behind the counter is on her phone at this point as well. Then a guy from the back had to run up and take the guys order while the two employees sat on their phone and ignored customers. There's now a line nearly to the door and still only 1 person ringing. Girl that was on her phone was also spending most of her time drawing a picture of Yoshi on the black board. We finally get our food 1 piece of the meal at a time, 1 sandwich every 10 minutes, we had to remind them of our onion rings order and when the young girl gave it to us she dropped it off nearly spilling the ranch dipping sauce across our table. Just not well run, staff is not trained well, and would seem like they don't take any pride in their jobs."}
{"text":"How can you not love a sandwich joint with fun names like Menage A Trois or the Stand By Me. This latest newcomer in Downtown Burbank apparently is catching on, judging by the crowd that began pouring in at lunchtime.  Started my first visit with the Marilyn Monroe, a generous portion of halal (shredded) chicken, honey mustard and pepper jack, served warm in their signature Dutch crunch (terrific) bread. My wife went veggie and tried the Jan Jan Jan, featuring breaded eggplant.  Another thumbs up.  Loved the colorful interior with a whimsical lunchbox decor. Can't wait to go back and try the Paul Reubens. You figure it out."}
{"text":"Cool,cool,cool. Crazy awesome sandwiches and atmosphere. Look at the menu ahead of time if you can."}
{"text":"The hype is real! Fantastic service (long haired dude was full of positive energy!), and the Elvis Kieth is insanely good. 5 easy stars!!"}
{"text":"How have I never heard of this place before? I ordered this via Postmates because the descriptions of the sandwiches looked good. I am a vegetarian and I got a breakfast sandwich with the veggie bacon on it. WOW. This is the best sandwich I've eaten in a very long time! Excited to visit this place in person sometime!"}
{"text":"The best sandwich shop I have ever been to! I look forward to coming to Mesa not because of the weather or the joy of the satellite office, but because of Ike's. I've tried the Thanksgiving, the Menage a Trois and the Spiffy Tiffy or something. Everything has been straight up delicious but the Menage a Trois definitely takes the cake. As if the sandwiches weren't good enough, the staff is SO friendly and they play 90s and early 00s tracks for a nostalgic trip down memory lane. WIN. WIN. WIN."}
{"text":"Just moved into a new neighborhood and used Yelp to find nearby restaurants. Ike's has 5 stars so I decided to try. 
I ordered the bear claw which sofa king yummy. Yummy yummy yummy. Staff was friendly and place was clean. Stoked it's so close to me, I'll definitely be going back for more!"}
{"text":"Updated review because they refunded me and dealt with the issue thoroughly. Thanks for that!

Ordered Ike's from UberEats and the order was a DISASTER. They didn't give us the drink or chips we ordered. One sandwich was supposed to be turkey and cheese only and it came with lettuce, tomato, AND onion. Another sandwich was supposed to come with the roast beef and extra cheese on the side. Apparently, \"they don't do that\" so they charged us for the extra cheese and didn't give it to us and the sandwich just came minus the roast beef. We paid for about $10 worth of stuff that didn't even get to us."}
{"text":"This place continues to amaze me. Not your same ol sandwich shop. Packed with flavor! A little pricey but by far worth it."}
{"text":"This is the worst nasty expensive sandwich ever. 
I believe Ike's pay a service to give them a five star review when they open up at their stores. 
Too much dirty sauce on everything."}
{"text":"I'm originally from the Bay Area, where Ike's began. When I moved away, one of the things I thought I would miss the most is Ike's! Imagine my surprise when I found one right here, a close driving distance from my house. 

The best part is that they use real, San Francisco sourdough bread. It's amazing. One of the other things I miss from my home town is sourdough bread. It's fabulous to be able to satisfy my cravings here. 

Their sandwiches are wonderful. I've never been disappointed. The people who work here are also very nice. The other day, the nice man who works there brought my sandwiches to my car for because because my kids were asleep in the car. For anyone who has kids, you know what a big deal this is. 

I'm so happy to have an Ike's here! I'll continue eating here!"}
{"text":"If you're willing to stand in line for an inordinate amount of time, and then wait an additional long time for your sandwich, you end up getting a better than average sandwich.  When I decided to save time and order by phone, I Googled their location but unfortunately the site defaults to the San Francisco location menu ( which is different from Mesa, AZ )  so that was a big fail.  When I called the Mesa store to see how I could view a menu online and phone it in, I was placed on hold for another longgggg period of time.  The guy who answered told me that I would just have to come to the store-  and apologized that there was no way to even view a menu from the Mesa location.  So , that ends my short relationship with Ike's.  Their culture conveys a \"hipper than thou- you'll just have to wait & wait if you want one of these exclusive sandwiches\"  attitude.  Is this a hot new nightclub, or a sandwich shop?  Are you kidding me?"}
{"text":"What a delicious lunch spot!  I went with my sisters here to celebrate a birthday and we were thrilled with the experience!!!  We were greeted by one of the most friendly, knowledgeable employees named Melissa.  Right away she made us feel like family and had great recommendations from the plenteous sandwich options.  We requested to have our 3 sandwiches cut into thirds so we could sample a variety.   We literally couldn't decide which sandwich we liked the best as all of them were out-of-this-world scrumptious!  We tried the spiffy tiffy(chicken and pesto), the coming home for Thanksgiving (turkey, cranberry and Siracha) and Hollywood Cheese steak (ribeye and mushroom).  They were so moist and flavorful.  We will all definitely be back."}
{"text":"First time at Ike's. It's in downtown Tempe, near the movie theater.  Walked in 'solo' after Star Wars and we were the only party. 

There are dozens of sandwiches and combos. I ordered the MILF, adding fried chicken instead of halal chicken, on a Dutch crunch roll. Got a Thanksgiving on gluten free bread. for my beloved wife. 

Our dinner arrived in about six mins, hot and fresh. We didn't eat until we got home but it was still plenty warm. The bread was soft yet crusty on the outside and the fillings were plentiful. The poppers were a nice addition to the fried chicken. Loved my choice. My wife said she thought I had gotten her regular bread instead of GF cuz it was so yummy. 

I will be returning to Ike's, especially since learning about several locations throughout the valley."}
{"text":"Dutch Crunch Munch

Ikes is my favorite sandwich shops around The Valley. They really know how to make a sandwich; their Dutch Crunch bread is delicious and they really stack on meat. I have tried their Steve Nash, the Batman, and the Cain Velasquez, the Steve Nash being my favorite. The only thing I would suggest id to either split the sandwich or ask for less spread because their sandwiches can be very heavy."}
{"text":"VERY VERY good. I love this place. I was a virgin until this week. Great creative sandwiches and friendly staff. I had the the Bear Hug. It was amazing!"}
{"text":"I have a problem giving a sandwich place five stars so Just consider this is rating sandwich place against other sandwich places. Decent atmosphere, friendly helpful staff, really well-made sandwiches. I've also read some of the other reviews and I would agree with all of the really good ones.  I don't agree with the ones that run the place or the food down. But it does go to show that nobody can guarantee that you will think this is five stars. Hope you at least give it a try it's worth it."}
{"text":"First time at this Ike's. Arrived at 11:45 for a Wednesday lunch and there were 8 in line in front of me. The line took 12 mins. 

I ordered the 504 Thunderbird which is only available in Mesa. It had pastrami, thunderbird sauce and smoked Gouda on a Dutch Crunch roll (my choice of five breads) for $9.99 plus tax. 

My lunch was ready in nine minutes because they make every sandwich to order. 

The bread was soft on the inside yet with a delicious crunch to the crust. The meat was plentiful and cooked properly.  The sauce was just the right touch: moist but not sloppy. 

The smoked Gouda was a very nice touch. Add in the fresh veggies and you've a winner."}
{"text":"The service was amazing from the second we walked in the door. The cashier was a sweet blonde girl who helped us with the daunting menu (there are just so many choices). I only eat gluten-free so it was nice to find a sandwich shop that had that option. The GF bread was one of the best I have had. It was also the same size as the regular sandwich which is not normally the case (most times it is much smaller). My sandwich was delicious (spiffy tiffy) and my fiancé loved his. They were very accommodating to food allergies and preferences allowing us to change or remove anything we wanted from the sandwiches on the menu. 

We stayed and are there in the fun atmosphere they created. The kitchen crew cheers for orders which was really fun. Then the tables were all brightly colored and each napkin holder had a different handwritten message on it. If you stay to eat in you get a free chips and drink as well. 

Overall this was a very good choice for dinner and I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Whaaaaaaat this place is amazing! We drove by several times wondering what it was, and after seeing the Yelp reviews decided to try it out. We split the vegetarian meatball sub and it was CRAZY. It tasted better than any other real meatball sub I've had. Everyone was very helpful and nice. Just plan on spending some time looking at the menu because there a lot of choices. Excited to go back!"}
{"text":"We have quickly become regulars here due to their wealth of delicious vegan/vegetarian sandwiches. These sandwiches are the bomb. The staff here is very friendly and I think the prices are reasonable considering you're getting something super tasty. 
To people complaining about the prices: feel free to get your bland-a$$ 5 dollar foot long and leave all the tasty sandwiches for me:)"}
{"text":"Food Poisoning Central!  I never get sick anywhere...my stomach is an iron trap.  But Ikes got me good with the halal chicken.  Something didnt taste quite right but it was my first time there so I just went with it.  After eating half a sandwich, I immediately  felt full...waaayyy too full.

Six hours later, I experienced the worst night of my life.  The next day wasn't so great either.
Needless to say I will NEVER eat Ike's Love sandwiches again. I wish I knew where else to report this."}
{"text":"The best sandwich shop I've ever been to. Highly recommend the Julius Caesar, on their signature bread. Just tremendous."}
{"text":"My first time in here and the cashier was so nice to help me out and pick what I wanted . I was debating between the MILF or the ménage e trois  and he said those were the 2nd and most popular menu items. But I choose to go with the ménage e trois with all the fixings and told him to hook it up with everything.  Literally the biggest sandwich ever and it was so good ! I had 2 of my coworkers take a bite and they were blown away too.  Totally obsessed and will be back !"}
{"text":"I love this place so much. My office recently moved from Scottsdale to Mesa and ever since I discovered Ike's I've been eating there every week. My coworkers always get excited when it's Ike's Day. The chicken is fantastic and the sourdough bread is really nice and sour, which is strangely hard to find. My only complaint is that since I first started going there a few months ago, it seems like they put less meat on the sandwiches now so it's mostly bread. Very good bread, mind you, but I'd like  a little more meat without having to spend the $4 upcharge for extra."}
{"text":"This place rocks! a friend told me about it and she wasn't joking. it's Cheba Hut on steroids and I don't feel like a bad uncle bringing my niece in.  Try the \"going home for thanksgiving.\"  Its awesome"}
{"text":"Hated to give Ike's only 3 stars, but most times I go there they are out of their amazing Dutch Crunch bread. The other sandwich ingredients are great but so disappointing when you drive all the way there from N. Scottsdale and the bread is gone again. Time to move on and try some of the other local sandwich shops."}
{"text":"Really should be 3.5 stars. I was looking forward to going here after reading all the good reviews. I got a California something - BLT with avocado, dirty sauce, on Dutch Crunch. It was a huge sandwich - really like a double, so the price was right. The bread seemed almost stale and the sandwich was dry. The ingredients inside seemed fresh and they don't skimp. For that reason, I will give them another try with another sandwich and re-evaluate."}
{"text":"Best subs since Cheba Hut, pay a little more get a way more flavorful sub. By far the best sub sandwich place in AZ."}
{"text":"I tried this place in San Francisco, so couldn't have been happier when I discovered it here on a work trip! Absolutely delicious. They will make ones that they have at other locations too, so I got the Love Triangle (Menage A Trois with Vegan Breaded Chicken). Will be going back for more vegetarian sandwiches while I'm here!"}
{"text":"It was definitely definitely delicious and the workers were friendly however, I over heard the table next to me getting there sand which with out ham when they ordered ham and I got my sandwich with ham when I ordered it with out . Not eating pig is a pretty big deal to me so I was just a bit disappointed the same mistake happened with two different customers in a matter of 5 minutes. Food is good and worth going back I just hope for the right order next time."}
{"text":"Awesome food, awesome ingredients. They have gluten-free bread, which is actually GOOD! Everything else tastes high quality.

The sandwiches do get a little sloppy, but it's because of all the ingredients packed into them. They are also a little expensive, but you get what you pay for so I can't really complain.

I've had this place a few times now, and its all been great. Definitely recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Wow, . Eat one of the tastiest sandwiches I've ever had on that price level. The average sandwich which is huge costs between seven dollars and $10.  You walk in and there is a very very large board on the wall of every type of sandwich you can think of even vegetarian. If you don't see anything you want, they can make you what you want. The service staff are friendly and helpful and actually funny. The restaurant is clean and attractive and definitely for groups and families. But here's the deal the sandwiches are delicious the bread they use is different and they're very filling.  Ikes is located on the east side Alma School, south of Southern, across from Fiesta Mall. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"EVERYONE loves Ike's. It's amazing. I definitely recommend going with someone and splitting a sandwich since they can get slightly pricey, but these sandwiches are HUGE. I always get two meals out of it if I don't split with anyone."}
{"text":"1 Star because I came in at 10:45 AM and no one to be found.. I was even saying \" hello\" in a loud voice and no one responded.. and they had a really loud speaker playing music in the kitchen too.. 10 mins later two workers appears.. didn't even say sorry or anything.. first and last time here.. smoke break? Didn't even see them wash their hands.. thanks.."}
{"text":"Husband wanted a basic turkey sandwich. They don't have plain mayo so he had dirty (garlic) aioli instead on the crunch bread. He also asked for cold. Turns out bread is half cooked so that when they make the sandwiches hit it cooks the rest of the way. It took a bit longer but he thought the crunch bread was very good. Turkey was high quality. 

I wanted to try the halal chicken on wheat but had trouble  find one that sounded good that wasn't sweet. I finally settled on the Elvis Keith(or something like that??). The chicken had a very good flavor and was obviously quality but didn't prefer the wasabi mayo flavor with it. I think I need to play around to figure out what works for me. 

Downgrade also was they had not made any iced tea that day. It was ready by the time our meal was almost over but a bummer for someone who doesn't drink soda. 

Upgrade is that Sunday's they have happy hour and you get free drinks and chips so at least I didn't pay for my drink. (You may need to ask for the happy hour special? It wasn't mentioned until I asked but maybe he would have?)

Worth trying again to see if I can find something spicy with the chicken that I like."}
{"text":"I truly could eat here every freaking day! No joke. 

It's about a 45 min drive each way for me but I would drive that way multiple times a day if it meant I could get another sandwich!  This place is truly amazing & I've already been there 2 times this week.

Visiting the first time I was really overwhelmed with all of the choices but the guy behind the counter kinda walked us through everything & helped us pick the perfect sandwich.  The workers talked to us like we were old friends.  I ordered The Change which was sliced ribeye, BBQ sauce, onion rings & gouda cheese.  I can honestly say it was one of the most amazing sandwiches I've ever had.  Ever.  They are pretty pricy but worth every penny. LOVE all the different choices they have, you can go the healthy route or you can just go crazy (like I did) & even add mozzarella cheese sticks to a sandwich!  

PLEASE OPEN ONE CLOSER TO ME! :("}
{"text":"My usual sandwich shop was closed for the holiday so I searched for a new place and found this. I was pleasantly surprised. The sandwiches are very big (I got it on Dutch crunch bread) and super good!! I will def be back to try other combinations. I got the soprano with no ham extra salami. It was delicious!! Love finding good sub shops!! Service was great as well!"}
{"text":"I passed three sub shops to try Ike's out.  I was excited to try a local small shop sub.  Sadly I feel let down.  

The counter girl was very friendly.  A large selection of subs.  I got the Pee Wee..  Vegetarian turkey, coleslaw etc..  on their signature bread.  The sandwhich cost 9.50.  I thought, \"this is going to be great!\"  Umm. I wasn't  a fan of the bread.  Kinda day oldish to me.  I could have got over that, but the fact that my sandwitch tasted like lettuce, bread and a bit of a tang that reminded me of garlic.  I got one stinkin peice of faux turkey for over 9 bucks!?!  It could have been omitted and I wouldn't have noticed.  I was expecting more of a California club, or something along that line.  The sandwich is big.  I ate 1/2, but if it were good, I would have scarfed it all.  Sad...

I gave them a 3 cause the girl was so friendly.  
A 2 on the sub due to my value perception.
I actually thought as I was eating that maybe I got the wrong sub?

Hmmm. Update...  I think it was the wrong sub.  I didn't have any cheese on it.  The Pee Wee has Swiss...??    Epic Fail..."}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING!  Ike knows how to make the perfect sandwich!  He also knows how to provide an outstanding experience to customers.  We went right before catching a show not far from here at the Mesa Amphitheater.  A big thank you to fellow yelpers for being so honest about just how AWESOME the food is.  We happen to go during happy hour and were surprised to find they do chips and drink as the \"happy hour.\"  Very clever idea.  The menu is extensive so anyone you bring will be happy because it's a sure bet they will find something they enjoy.  Even if it isn't posted up on the menu (like what I said I wanted) they are sure to have it, and have a fun name for it.  They were quick with taking our order but the staff was friendly and unlike other places you may stop to grab a quick sandwich you could tell they actually ENJOYED being there.  I can't say how much it changes the experience when you go to a place like this when the people working there make you feel like they actually are happy to be there.  

The very best part was the advertisement for the happy hour had the coolest photo!  A funky feline helped sell the meal to us!  (See Photos) 

Thank you Ike's for not only an exceptional meal but an awesome experience!"}
{"text":"OMG, this is the best gluten free sandwich I have ever had! Saw that they had GF bread and I just had to try it. Sandwiches are not normally something I get to have (celiac sucks), so when I can I love them. They had so many options - I really do recommend checking the website first and deciding what you want. It took us a long time looking at the board to choose. The space is very small - definitely better for take out (they also deliver which is nice). Our cashier was very helpful in assisting us in our sandwich choice. Turns out he was celiac too, so I was comfortable with his assurances that cross contamination with normal bread is minimal (and I didn't get sick - huge bonus!). We will definitely be back here, and often!"}
{"text":"Nom Nom Nom Nom!  Everything I have tried here has been delicious so you can't really go wrong with any selection.  

I suggest the Dutch crunch bread. I think it really makes the sandwiches something different. My favorite is the Count of Monte Chase-O.

If you are going during lunch time allot extra time in your schedule.  It gets packed and it will take you forever to get your order."}
{"text":"Horrible! None of our sandwiches were done correctly. I specifically asked for no mayo on mine and the sandwich for my kids. Mine came with mayo and I didn't think to check my daughters. I'm glad she refused to eat it because she would have gone into anaphylactic shock had she eaten it because they put mayo on it which has egg and she is very allergic to.  They re-made my sandwich but got it wrong again. I'm now back in Phoenix with two sandwiches we won't eat and $20 down the drain."}
{"text":"Really really good. I got the pesto chicken sandwich protein style and it was delicious. Lots of lettuce and the sandwich was huge. They literally make any sandwich under the sun. You'll definitely find something you like here. It's a little hard to find and off the road, under some staircases, but it's a nice gem that you'll find yourself coming back to again and again!"}
{"text":"The best sandwich shop around. I love a good sandwich and it does not get better than the Thunderbird with Dutch Crunch bread. If you like your food a lil spicy try it and you'll be plenty happy."}
{"text":"First time here, heard good things. Was not disappointed.

Don't be discouraged by the seemingly high prices, one sandwich is easily two meals. I had the Lynda Carter; breaded eggplant with melty gouda, fresh avocado, and thousand island dressing. Topped off with lettuce, tomato, and (free) red onions. Seriously, one half of this deliciousness more than filled me up for lunch.

Lots of vegetarian options and lots of additions/substitutions. Bright and friendly establishment with helpful staff. A must-try for the Tempe sandwich-eater."}
{"text":"On May 10th Marc Community Resources had Ike's cater a lunch for a Mesa Chamber Safety Committee Meeting. We were thrilled with the service (including their delivery and setting up). The food was sensational and it included vegan choices that were well received.
For your next event, consider using Ike's. We know we will!"}
{"text":"The only reason the did get that star was because the sandwich taste good.  To much breath not enough meat, and over priced sandwiches.  Go to Lennys it's better in every way."}
{"text":"Had my first encounter with Ike's yesterday and what a tasty one of was! Warm tomato, garlicky pesto, flavorful turkey on soft yet crunchy bread.  Thanks for the excellent customer service too.  Stephan Jenkins, you rock! I'll be checking out some of your friends next...."}
{"text":"This sandwich shop is beyond eccentric and also...delicious. I came here on a short lunch break from asu, and while there is plenty of seating outside, only a few tables indoors. The sandwich menu is crazy, and I love the references to pop culture. I can't get enough of this place. Those chips? Amazing!!!"}
{"text":"My sandwich was sooo good but the guy there creeped me out so much idk if I can ever go back"}
{"text":"I'll be back at Ike's for sure. This was my first time, and I tried one of their recommendations, the MILF sandwich. It was truly a unique sandwich. The spice level was just right, and combination of the meat and sauces was perfect. The size of most sandwiches here is around 8\", and they can serve them in a wide variety of breads. The only problem that one may face at this location is the parking, it may be a challenge on a weekend evening during the busy times at Mill Ave. Highly recommended place, and I'll definitely be back to try many more sandwiches here!"}
{"text":"Wow! Has the chicken w provolone n honey mustard. Incredibly good. The menu is huge. Vegetarians n vegans will have plenty of choices too along with us carnivores.  S. F. restaurant w fresh baked bread. Can't wait to go back. The staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Wow. Since discovering this place I have been back about 5 times. One of the best sandwich places I've been too. I don't want to hype it up too much, because you should discover this place for yourself.

My favorite is the Ménage a Trois."}
{"text":"Excellent! 3rd Ike's location I have been to and this one was up to par with the San Francisco location. I ordered the Bella and it was great! Staff was very friendly and the place was clean. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a bomb sandwich!"}
{"text":"I'm in the area on a business trip and decided to visit this spot for lunch. I ordered the mozerralla's cheese ( can't remember the actual name) but it was good. On the cashiers recommendation I exchanged the shredded chicken for fried chicken. The sandwich also had honey, honey mustard, and 2 types of cheese. It was very tasty. 


The service is also very good. The staff is friendly and patient with new customers who maybe overwhelmed by the size of the menu.

If you are in the Mesa area, try this place out for lunch."}
{"text":"I love Ike's as they have a ton of vegan options and I really like that you can bring in your own cup for soft drinks or tea as I hate using styrofoam that is thrown away and adding more to the landfill.  Great food.  All the bread is vegan.  Really great air fries."}
{"text":"I came to Ike's today because my parents wanted their favorite sandwich. I have to be gluten free...so I always discuss with the staff prior to ordering to ensure I will not be glutened. The manager stepped in and we discussed my needs. Then she took it upon herself to make me a sandwich and accommodate me...I left with 3 Tony Soprano sandwiches. Mine was prepared with the best care to prevent cross contamination and for this I am thankful. Their gluten free bread is good and the sandwich was great! 
Thank you, thank you for taking care of me today. You went above and beyond. 
Highly recommend this restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"We are absolutely OBSESSED with this place. It's honestly one of the best sandwich places I have ever been to. The quality and combination of their ingredients make it simply amazing!"}
{"text":"Can I just say this place is DELICIOUS!!!!! The staff is so awesome and fun as well :) Also if you're vegan please try the Pirates of the Carribean it's amazing... Please try it and for you vegetarians you can definitely enjoy some delights as well. Something for everyone!!!! YAY!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is the BEST!!!!!! I have no complaints about the food but I wish their website worked a little better."}
{"text":"I usually don't like sandwiches. I also do not like things that are priced higher than they need to be. But some how Ike's manages to overcome my biases and eek out a good scoring review.

The main reason I am a \"fan\" is due to the large vegetarian options and are more than a salad on bread or cheese on bread sandwich. I also apreicate having a unique dutch bread option and the free candy apple lolly at the end.

I have tried two subs, the first was the vegetarian meatball sub. It had fake meat some kind of creamy sauce and lettuce, it worked, for $10 I then had to go back to work.

I also tried the pilgrim which had tofurkey and cranberry sauce. Again the mix of flavors and textures worked.

They have some impressive sounding sides, but due to the prices they do not seem to get ordered much."}
{"text":"Placed an order for 1 sandwich over the phone to pick up. I did this because I've heard there can be long waits and I had alot to do at work. The person I spoke with was very pleasant despite sounding busy (the only reason they have 2 stars instead of 1) and he provided a time to pick up of 25 minutes. Understanding that they were busy, I was completely ok with this. Arrived at Ike's a few minutes after the time given over the phone, there was a huge line almost out the door. The cashier took my money pretty quick but when he went to check on my sandwich, it wasn't done and I was told it would be\"just a bit.\" Seeing I was a bit irritated, the cashier said \"we are really busy but we'll throw in some coupons.\" Oh how nice of them... Why did I even bother to call it in? They had more than 25 minutes from the time I called to the time I arrived (I got there a few minutes later than the time they told me it would be ready) to make 1 sandwich and it still wasn't ready which is completely unacceptable when their website touts calling in your order. I sat waiting for my sandwich for another 15 minutes all the while watching them get orders out to other people who had been in the line when I arrived. The kitchen's priorities just seem to be out of whack and the cashier should have urged the kitchen to make my order a priority since it was supposed to be ready when I got there. When my order was ready, the cashier gave me a drink cup at no charge but after filling it, I realized there were no lids at the counter... just one more thing I had to wait for. The cashier made the comment that I just really wasn't having a good time there and I said that it was making me think I don't ever want to go back and mentioned that it took too long. The cashier was very apologetic and while I cannot fault him entirely for the issues, I do think there was more he could have done to get my order out  quicker. Additionally, those coupons that he offered were not given. Initially, I was willing to change my rating for Ikes if the sandwich turned out to be really good... it was simply ok and not worth waiting over 40 minutes for. It also had a ton of garlic in it. Don't get me wrong, I love garlic but this was kind of overkill. Needless to say, I will not be back."}
{"text":"Put the Matt Cain in your mouth. Dutch crunch bread. Trust me.  Put the thunderbird in your mouth. Dutch crunch bread. Listen to me. I love Ike's. I love that love and sandwiches from the bay have made it to Arizona. The service is always good. You could easily share a sandwich with someone because they're big. But why would you want to? When you can save the other half for later? They can be a bit messy to eat. But that's what napkins and washing your hands are for. So good. Also, you get a Carmel apple sucker with your meal. Delightful. Ooooh, and try the voodoo chips. Put Ike's in your mouth."}
{"text":"I've finally tried Ike's & I agree with the hype! I'm definitely a fan! 

I have been eyeing this place for quite a while but am 1) hardly in this area 2) if I am in this vicinity, it's hard to steer the BF away from Cheba Hut...but finally, I found myself driving up Alma School yesterday, BF-less, scoping out a place to grab lunch & decided on Ike's. 

Upon first glance, I was in a bit of sticker shock with their sandwiches in the $10 price range. But since I was already inside the store, they already had my complete buy in. The menu is very extensive which I liked because I love given variety. But since this is my first visit I thought I'd start with a simpler sandwich and opt to be daring on my next trip (if there is a next trip). I went with the Bella on Dutch Crunch Bread - Yelp's review highlights helped me decide. Although the gentlemen behind the register was very helpful with suggestions. 

While waiting, I heard a man at a nearby table ask one of the ladies to wrap up his other half of the sandwich to go because it was too large and he couldn't finish it. Okay, he was a pretty large fellow who I would assume could finish a whole sandwich for lunch (Yes, I totally judge him. Sorry, not sorry) so I began to wonder just how large these sandwiches really were. 5 minutes later, I received a brown bag to go with a ginormous sandwich! It was huge! Suitable for 2 people and totally justified the $10 price tag.

I was only able to finish half. The bread was nice and toasty. The chicken was thinly sliced and lightly dressed with honey mustard. The creamy avocado went perfectly with it. I saved half for the BF and he ate it this morning - heated up in the toaster oven to get the bread crispy again. We both liked it a lot. He said it was really good and that he wouldn't turn down my suggestions for Ike's next time!"}
{"text":"Found on yelp leaving back to California! Was great food I got the SunDevil and it was great! They have lots to chose from!"}
{"text":"I went tonight for the first time and it just so happened to be this location's one year anniversary. To celebrate, they gave away free subs with a check in (score!). Due to this, there was a pretty crazy line, but it was well worth the wait.

The staff was really nice! They were patient with questions and even rewrapped subs when we didn't finish. The man himself Ike was there and he was so friendly! Even though busy, he chatted with us for a bit, telling us his favorites.

Drawn to the uniqueness, I got the Bear Hug. It was so yummy! Just the right amount of spice and creaminess. I would definitely recommend it, but with so many options, you can't go wrong!

Parking is always a drag on Mill, but there is also a location nearby in Mesa for those wanting to avoid this."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised to see that the line wasn't out the door and around the corner, unlike the original Ike's location that I've frequented for the last ten years in San Francisco. I also loved that they've kept the menu consistent with the SF location, which made me a little homesick in a good way.

The service was friendly and quick, however, I had gotten my sandwich to-go and didn't open it until I got back to the office. I was heartbroken to see they had forgotten to put the BBQ sauce on my Menage A Trois :( Our office was 15min away so I couldn't go back to correct it. The sandwich was unfortunately pretty bland without that BBQ punch I had been anticipating."}
{"text":"Ordered food to pick up for my staff and they told me it would be ready in 15 minutes. Got there 20 minutes later and the sandwiches weren't ready. I sat around for another 20 minutes before I finally received it. When I asked why even order ahead the the person who said he was the manager told me \"yea right\" and walked away. Food might be good but their customer service  and attitude was horrible. Our office will never be back."}
{"text":"As far as a sandwich shop this is probably the best I've ever had The staff is extremely friendly. The food was quick in arriving at our table.  We just tried it because it was close to our hotel. Make sure you come here if you ever get a chance."}
{"text":"Great sandwich place that's tucked away on Mill Ave! With unique menu items, there is definitely something for everyone. They even have sandwiches that include mozzarella cheese sticks layered right in! I'm a big fan of their 'normal' turkey, bacon and swiss or tuna sandwiches. The Sun Devil sauce is amazing and be sure to take advantage of the free extra add in's i.e. onion, mustard, etc. I personally order my sandwich on the sourdough, but I've heard good things about the Dutch crunch along with their normal wheat and white. I had to deduct a star because it's really hard find a parking spot in the area without having to pay to park."}
{"text":"Ordered the pastrami on house bread. They had way too much on this sandwich to taste the pastrami.  The house  bread  tastes like saltine crackers on top.  Would try this place again has a ton of selection. Also they don't have ice tea . Seating was kind of limited so it if hot outside might want to take it to go."}
{"text":"Love the veggie sandwiches and the dutch crunch bread. A bit overpriced but the sandwiches are huge. They did miss a couple of ingredients on my sandwich a couple of times, like the habanero salsa. I just hope the place survives unlike all the previous establishments in this location."}
{"text":"The best place for delicious subs. Their menu is huge and I appreciate all of the vegan options. The crunch bread is the best! Portion sizes are huge. I highly recommend if you're in the mood for a big hearty sandwich."}
{"text":"I would come back to Ike's because my sandwich was quite tasty. I was expecting the roast beef to be cold but it must be because I'm from the East Coast. But no matter, it was still very tasty.  I ordered int on their signature bread, which was delicious.  My only wish was that my sandwich be a little bigger for what I paid.  Service was good. Place was clean. I would go back while in the Tempe area."}
{"text":"Tried this place since it was on my way to the hotel. They are brand new to Mesa. They have an impressive list of sandwiches. They have a lo g list of veggie sandwiches, if that is your preference.I ordered the \"Michael Jordan\" - a meatball sandwich. It was outstanding! One of the best meatball sandos I have had. The place itself is bright, clean and welcoming. The staff was friendly and helpful. I would certainly go again, and I highly recommend the place."}
{"text":"Someone just brought in a tray of sandwiches from ike's and I'm in love! The bread looked heavenly but I skipped the bread and ate the insides of what I believe were the \"sometimes I'm a vegetarian\" & \"Reggie Jackson\" & I'm definitely adding this spot to my regular lunch list!"}
{"text":"Sandwiches over priced and what sandwich place doesn't have mayo only something called dirty sauce.  Waste of time and money....."}
{"text":"Delicious! Don't trust google map! I walked mills up and down 3 times trying to find this fucking place! It's at the back of the building...yes I am an idiot. Anyway, service was great and the sandwich was delicious!!! I will definitely go back to try another. 

I like warm sandwiches and when the cashier said all their sandwiches comes warm, I was sold! Lol
So yea, if you like freshness and warmth, this place is for u!!"}
{"text":"Pretty incredible selection and menu item for vegeterians.  A solid 1/3 to 1/2 of the menu is geared for vegans / vegeterians.  With all kinds of awesome options like vegeterian meatballs to orange (fake) chicken sandwiches.   This is a place where really, the sky is the limit with your sandwich.  Gone are the days of ordering a salad between two slices of bread.  REAL food :)

That said, I only have 1 nit.  The sauces can be a little excessive in terms of calories and quantity (they do warn you... they're messy sandwiches).  That's really my only complaint.  That I can't come here every day or I'd blimp up even more than I already am.  They're that good, and that heavy!"}
{"text":"Work some what in the area and it was my 1st time I had a sammy from this location and it was good. Adam Richman on Dutch crunch... Good size sandwich and taste was on point. Ikes has yet to let me down. Make sure to check their menu at all locations. Just because it's not on the board.. doesn't mean it can't happen"}
{"text":"This place is kinda pricey for a sandwich but I give them 5 stars because the food is yummy!!"}
{"text":"Whole family LOVES their sandwhiches! Great variety! They actually have a whopping 700 sandwhiches!! Fries are AMAZING! Come and get your sandwhich fix here once in a while! Great place!"}
{"text":"Firstly, the number of sandwiches available is crazy! Having never been to this restaurant before, I was slightly overwhelmed by all the options. However, employees were very willing to offer suggestions and answer any questions I had. They offered a bunch of super cool combinations. I ended up ordering the MC Hammer which was delicious! The sandwich was big enough that I ate half, plus some fries, and was satisfied. The air-fried fries were delicious!!!!! They were probably my favorite part of the meal. I was, however, very disappointed by the jalapeño bites. In particular, because of the price. My friends and I paid $3.50 for this appetizer to share, and there were 4 jalapeño poppers. That seems a bit over priced for sure and to be honest, they weren't very good. That was the only disappointing part of my experience, and it's why I gave the restaurant 4 stars."}
{"text":"I give four stars only because i said specifically \"no cheese\" and when i was about half way done with the first half of my XXXtina the sammy fell apart and i realized it was cheesy.  i don't even want to attempt to finish the second half.  

my employer has ordered from here before and everything was delicious so i know they have amazing food.  i'm just disappointed that my order wasn't made as i requested.  

i'll give them another chance probably, once i get the slimy cheesy taste out of my mouth."}
{"text":"Stopped in after checking this place out online and saw they had a lot of vegetarian options. When I got there I was totally overwhelmed with all the options so I just went to the counter, told them what I was looking for, and the found the exact sandwich I wanted. It happened to be on a menu from one of their other locations, but they are able to make just about anything you could want. As a vegetarian, it's difficult to find any place that's overwhelming with veggie options, so this was honestly a breath of fresh air. I initially thought it was a little bit pricey, but once I got the sandwich and saw just how big it was, the price definitely seemed fair. So my only advice would be to only go when you're really hungry, 'cause you're about to get more food than you can handle.

I'll be back next time I'm around Mill!"}
{"text":"Get the Dutch Crunch bread--you will thank me. 
I had the Count of Monte Chase-o (Ham, Strawberry Preserves, Swiss, Turkey) with onions peppers, dirty sauce lettuce and tomatoes. Now, I was nervous about this complex of a sandwich with strawberry preserves, but oddly enough it works. It was a little over $8 for a huge, filling sandwich with the best flavors and textures I have ever had in a single sandwich. My tastebuds are still dancing.

This is a San Francisco chain and it shows with enough \"LOVE\" stuff around to make me feel like I should have flowers in my hair and break out my old \"granny skirt\" from 1969. There are both booths and tables and chairs. The restaurant looks clean with ample parking right at the door. The employees are friendly and willing to take the time to explain this very complex, diverse menu. 

Without a doubt this is the best sandwich shop I have ever been to."}
{"text":"I had absolutely been craving Ike's for days, and had been wanting to introduce my boyfriend to it as well. When I had finally found myself in the area (as this location is the most convenient for me) I stopped in to place a to go order.

I'm currently sitting here writing this and I will say that the service has been good, and the staff member who helped me was very nice and apologetic, but I was heartbroken to not only find they were out of the Dutch crunch bread, but also the jalapeño poppers. Two popular items on the menu. Both of which I was looking forward to enjoying this evening. 

I'm sure the sandwiches will be fine, but it doesn't feel the same."}
{"text":"After sampling Ike's sandwiches at different events, I decided to give the shop a try. I am torn on my review. The food quality, while messy, was very good, but the service was below average.

I got in line behind three people. It did not take long for someone to take my order, but it did take almost 20 minutes to deliver my sandwich. I only had 30 minutes for lunch, so this left me pressed for time. They only had one person running orders from the kitchen, and he was also the only one running the cash register. It was very inefficient. 

I think I will skip returning to this location. Especially during the lunch hour.

Also, they were out of bacon. What kind of sandwich/breakfast so runs out of bacon before noon?!"}
{"text":"Holy sandwich menu, Batman!! That was the best meatball sub EVER (called the Micheal Jordan for a good reason)!! The Boy got the Handsome Owl and it was a delicious vegetarian sandwich I'd consider getting my meat-loving self if I weren't worried about missing out on the meatballs!! The Dutch Crunch bread our sandwiches came on was super tasty with plenty of crunch AND soft chewiness. They even let me put the fried zucchini ON my sandwich instead of on the side!! These are the kind of sandwiches that are so tasty, you feel like you have to eat every bite - even if there's no room in your stomach.  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful when choosing from the huge list of choices. It was a fun place to be and their Happy Hour special for people eating there was a free drink and chips with your sandwich!! Even the music playing was great (old school R&B/rap...the fun stuff everyone loves to sing along with)! I can't wait till one opens in Phoenix. Hey Ike!! There's an old JB's that's closed on the corner of 32nd St. and Indian School - how about opening up shop there?!?!? I promise to bring all my friends!!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches were really good, but for two sandwiches, two bags of chips and two drinks, $30 is a little much. Also, the time it took to get the food was a little long."}
{"text":"Can I just copy/paste my review from the Mesa location? There's nothing really more to say than this place is amazing! Thank you so much for introducing me to this place, Chase!"}
{"text":"THANK YOU CHASE for introducing me to Ike's sandwiches!!! This place is seriously amazing! I don't even know the words to describe it's awesomeness. I'm sorry to say that it took me a good couple of months to finally go try a sandwich here once Chase suggested that I try it. I figured it was just another regular sandwich place like Subway, Quiznos or Jimmy John's... however, this is anything but like those places! There are hundreds of different sandwiches to choose from, it's almost overwhelming to take in. 

It was seriously SO AMAZING, that I went twice in one day!

I don't know how else to say this, but Ike's sandwiches surpass any sandwich I've ever had. When you go, you NEED to try the Menage a Trois sandwich. The description didn't blow me away... but once you taste it, oh.my.goodness!!! AMAZING! Thanks again Chase, Ike's is now a favorite! I can't wait for the Tempe location to open! :D:D"}
{"text":"Busy place, appears clean, staff friendly.  Asked for salt and was told I wouldn't need it and they had none, no pepper either.  I needed both it turns out.  Ordered 2 sandwiches and a side of fried onion rings.  The rings were too with breading and desperately needed salt but the ketchup had to do.  Had their Hollywoods SF Cheesesteak #2, the mushrooms were cold and tasteless, had tons of shredded lettuce, some tomato, lots of a mayo tasting sauce and I wasn't crazy about the dutch crunch bread, crunchy yes, flavor little and dry.  My wife said she liked the bread on her Bear Hug #444 (Bacon, extra dirty sauce, Mushrooms, Stuffed Jalapeno Poppers, Thinly Sliced Rib Eye Steak). She thought they deserved 3 stars and I thought 2 stars so I guess it will be 2 1/2 stars total.  I also thought it was too bad that they had no tea and their root beer was overly sweet."}
{"text":"I came to this location for the first time. I came to the outside window to the fast pick up because we were taking the food to go to eat at a different restaurant. I ordered my food and then the guy who took my order went back to make the sandwiches. He didn't take my friends order for another 5 min which was weird because when we looked inside if it was maybe busy there was no one there but us. Then another girl came and took my friends order. We then waited, I kid you not, 25 minutes for the two sandwiches . There was no one else there but us. I kept peeking in to see what the staff was doing and they were doing nothing and on top of that there was at least 6 people back there. I was super hungry and getting to that hangry point. I even asked a few times how much longer it would be along the way. They kept saying you're up next, but up next to who, no one else was there. Eventually we got our food after a long wait. 

So some of you may be wondering why give this place 3 stars still. Well because despite the wait the food was so good as usual. I wish I could say I'll come back to this location but most likely not because it was an irritating experience."}
{"text":"\"AmazeBalls!\" Extremely friendly staff, very unique sandwiches, both hot and cold, as well as vegetarian and nonvegetarian creations."}
{"text":"Favorite sandwich place ever, hands down, but it takes forever to make the sandwiches so if you're in a rush, order ahead. And there's free chips and drinks on Sunday. The Voodoo Chips are the best ;)"}
{"text":"This place is kind of like a mix between potbelly's and jimmy johns, but much more unique and creative. There are soooo many sandwich options and I wanted to try all of them! The vegetarian options looked especially intriguing. The Dutch crunch bread was really yummy, but not that crunchy once it soaks up all the sauce. I liked it better than jimmy johns bread. The sauces are pretty tasty but I have no idea what's actually in them because there's no descriptions of them. The dirty sauce kind of seemed like a thick garlicky aioli, more like a spread than a sauce. The sandwiches are also huge, especially when you add toppings like lettuce and tomato, and I was so full afterward. Wouldn't come with a big group because there isn't much seating. Definitely want to come back and try more!"}
{"text":"Great employees and phenomenal food. Rain or shine you will never find a better sandwich than this! I eat Ike's at least every week if not more and will never tire of it."}
{"text":"Really good. About 50 subs on the board. They're made fresh, so it took a few minutes but worth the wait. Nice clean space, friendly and about $9."}
{"text":"This sandwich place is amazing! There are so many options, you could have a different sandwich for every day of the year! I love this place more than a fat kid loves cakes"}
{"text":"Tucked away a little off Mill, this is one of the only Ike's that serves breakfast and let's not forget they have a dessert sandwiches too! With tons of vegetarian and vegan options (they have fried chicken as well if that is more your type of thing) there is a sandwich here to please any and everyone. The sandwiches are huge! Any of the ones priced over $12.00 are intended to be shared or can easily feed one very hungry person. (BTW: French is my bread of choice and don't forget the dirty sauce.) Also, they have a rotating sandwich of the week since Ike's has over 500+ options between all of their locations. Do your hungry tummy a favor and stop here soon."}
{"text":"Delicious! This place certainly knows how to make a tasty sandwich. The bread is soft but crunchy and didn't get soggy! That's a big deal for me. Nobody likes the gross soggy party at the end...looking at you Subway. Not to mention they use fresh veggies and delicious sauces. Lets not forget the awesome jalapeño poppers that you can get in your sandwich was well! Also, I'm super impressed with the fact that there are so many different sandwich options and they have many vegetarian and vegan choices.These sandwiches are huge as expected for the prices! Almost wish they had a smaller size option as well. Oh well, just save some for later!"}
{"text":"Holy sh*t was that a great sandwich. I ordered the Barry Bonds on French bread. So good, plus you get caramel apple suckered! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was so excited when I found out Ike's has an Arizona location and it's only a few miles down the street from my house. I am Gluten Intolerant and this is the best sandwich shop hands down in the valley.... that I can eat at. They even ask what your gluten sensitivity level is and make adjustments in the kitchen specifically for you. 

Bomb sandwiches, get one."}
{"text":"Ted Danson sandwich was amazing - make sure you add lettuce and tomato and get it on the Dutch bread! They make their bread fresh everyday!"}
{"text":"Not sure if my waistline is thrilled but I personally am stoked that Ike's is slowly getting closer to me (next stop, Scottsdale!?). 

I stand by my statement that I had the best sandwich I've ever eaten here. It's hidden on Mill and located right behind the wine bar and *ahem*, they have a great happy hour!

Here's how the experience works. This is a casual sandwich eatery where you can come in solo, order and take it to go, or dine in with a couple friends. Anything goes at Ike's. Now, when you walk in, you'll immediately be overwhelmed by a board listing off a variety of every sandwich combo imaginable and it's not your run of the mill sandwich combo. No way. It's a combo of everything good in life that's put in between two slices of bread and served either hot or cold, depending on your sandwich. I suggest looking at Yelp reviews, pictures and the menu before you arrive to avoid major menu anxiety like I experienced. Also, note that every sandwich has a hilariously funky name so you might get lost in translation just simply reading the names!

Once you've made your sandwich selection, you'll order at the counter from one of the incredibly friendly staff and they are truly genuinely friendly! It was such a breath of fresh air to experience a sandwich at Ike's. The decor is just as fun and funky as the staff and sandwich choices and be sure to look on your napkin holder because it will tell you something pretty about you!

Now on to the best part, the sandwich. I don't even know where to begin. First, they serve this special bread that typically can only be found in N. Cal and it's amazing. Cheese is baked into the bread. I tried the Bella which is their most popular and I'm not surprised. It's a combo of chicken that has been slow-cooked for several hours and then tossed in this delicious honey mustard. Then they top it with cheese, avocado and this special mayo spread. I suggest adding some hot sauce to it. It's served hot and it is large and in charge, so unless you're ready for a last supper meal you will probably have some left-overs or your might want to share. It's worth every single calorie consumed and then some."}
{"text":"I don't throw the following sentence out very often but when I do, I mean business so here it goes...I had the best sandwich I've ever eaten here. I am not exaggerating. So if you stop reading this review right this second, at least you know and now you can you get into the car, make your way to Mesa and try one for yourself. 

So on to the rest of the review. I've been lucky enough to have an Ike's sandwich in SF and couldn't believe my eyes when I found out they were moving to Arizona. Their location is a bit of a drive for me, but the sandwich truly makes it worth it.

Now, although this is about a 15-20 minute drive from my house, I will absolutely be visiting on a regular basis and can't wait for them to open additional locations!

PS - if you get lost, it's across the street from the mall!"}
{"text":"Oh Ike, 

Can't believe I just found that place.

Seriously, just fell in love!

Boyfriend and I went during happy hour, 4-7 everyday. Includes free chips and drink with sandwich order. Probably won't go at any other time, the deal makes it that much better. 

The lady at the register helped break down the menu for us, I decided on the 111 ménage a trois. Love, love, love! Definitely a must try if you like a sweet kick to your sandwiches!  

The boyfriend got the bear hug.  That sandwich is seriously genius. The jalapeño poppers inside are so delicious. 

Can't wait to go back and try the different options! 

I probably won't be stepping inside of a subway ever again!"}
{"text":"I'm from out of town and stopped here because of the reviews. This place delivered on all cylinders. Service was friendly, fast and the food was really good. We had the Tony Soprano and Paul Reubens with a side of Onion Rings. Great bread to meat ratio and most importantly to me the bread had the proper \"chewabllity\" of a great sandwich. I think they have brought the essence of the great \"San Francisco\" bread, successfully to the Phoenix area. Onion rings were good, house made which is always a plus, not super outstanding like the sandwiches but it is Ike's Love and sandwiches not Ike's onion rings after all. Wish I lived closer to here, but I will be back anytime I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Had three different sandwiches, for my daughters and myself, all were crazy good. So filling, even though it was lunch you won't need to eat again that day. Can't wait to go back, wondered if they sell the Dutch bread to take home, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place, and eat here about once a week. Yes it's a little pricy but I don't mind paying for quality food. Totally worth it. Lots of vegatarian options."}
{"text":"When was the last time you had a good sandwich? Better yet, if you're celiac how long has it been since you had a philly cheesesteak? They make gluten free buns and they do not disappoint. Unique sandwiches, great atmosphere and the ingredients taste like real food. Our friend ordered delivery and I had the home for thanksgiving sandwich.... You had me at sriracha with turkey and cranberry with a gorgeous havarti cheese. You're brilliant IKEs and I LOVE you right back.  Give this shop a try. 
Side note: fast, friendly, knowledgeable staff. Food was out in 5 min max. Free caramel apple lollipop with your order and the retro soda station are awesome."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Sandwiches are large subs like 15\" but have less meat than subway. I got the Adam richman which has 2 slices of ham and two diced up chicken tenders and tons of lettuce for $11.11. My fiancé got the thunderbird which had 8 slices of pastrami and was bland for $9.99. We also got the fried zucchini which had like 7 zucchini chips for $3.93 and the air fries for $4.94. 

The best thing we are was the air fries and The service was great."}
{"text":"Looking for a Friday lunch spot with good reviews led us to Ike's. The menu was extensive and left us standing for a few minutes trying to decide.

I chose the #2 - Hollywould's SF Cheesesteak with French bread. The steak was more of a gyro style then traditional ribeye, however it had a good taste. The cheese was good but they skimped on the mushrooms. Hubby had #504 - The Thunderbird with French bread. Hubby declared that it was all good with no complaints. We also enjoyed a side of onion rings. 

The sandwiches were big. If you are light eaters you should probably share. Hubby thought he could not eat the whole thing but somehow he managed to muscle through. I was very surprised to see RC Cola fountain drinks. I hadn't seen this since we moved from the south 3 years ago.

My one suggestion to Ike's is a waiting area for carry out orders and more seating in general. We stood waiting for a table to become available. To my surprise/irritation 3 tables were occupied by patrons waiting for carry out."}
{"text":"Hallelujah for the sandwich gods for gracing me with some Ike's. Being a Bay Area transplant, I already had insanely high hopes for the various Ike's locations in AZ. I particularly wanted to check out this specific location out because of the amazing sounding Jeremy Stoppleman sandwich that they have on the menu. I dropped by around 6:30 pm on a Friday and grabbed the Jeremy Stoppleman (breaded eggplant, green pesto, grilled tomato, provolone, and habanero) with an order of the beer battered mozzarella sticks. Now, the sandwich itself was super delicious. The dutch crunch bread always satisfies my carb craving and the eggplant + pesto + habanero combo was amazing. I would definitely drive out to Tempe just to get the same exact sandwich again. The mozzarella sticks though were a bit disappointing, particularly for the price. One order only comes with 4 sticks and they honestly don't taste all that special so I'd really recommend passing on that unless you just really cannot live without mozzarella sticks. The cashier who I interacted with was super friendly and helpful and it was a great experience overall. Definitely a place to check out if you want delicious meat/veggie/vegan sandwiches with some interesting twists!"}
{"text":"Hello yummsville! This is a chain from San Fran, but it's a great lunch spot! So many different sandwich options with funny famous San Fran names, such as the Barry Bonds (my favorite)!

Definitely add the smoked Gouda to any sandwich! So good! It takes a long time to read the menu and make choices, and it's not super fast in terms of service - but definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Found this place for lunch, and the name doesn't lie, I am in LOVE!

The sandwiches are giant - I could only eat half! so many different varieties and options, and tons of gluten free or vegan options as well. 

I had the Barry Bonds and then suped it up with the smoked Gouda, avocado, lettuce, red onion, and Dijon mustard. Delicious.

Only thing I would change is to have more seating in the restaurant - the kitchen to seating ratio is like 4 to 1... kind of ridiculous. But I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is an excellent sandwich and I have had some of the most amazing sandwiches on the planet on a regular basis (look up Bay Cities Italian Deli in Santa Monica & do yourself a favor, don't miss it if you are ever in the area!).  I have been searching for something to live up to Bay Cities ever since I moved here and all have failed miserably until now.  

I totally forgot the name of the sandwich I had, there are a lot of different funky names, it can get overwhelming when you first dine here.  But, it had chicken & avocado and was delicious.

Next time I'm going for the Roast Beef.  The only thing they are missing is Parma Prosciutto."}
{"text":"As a former meat eater, this place is a godsend. I LOVE meatball subs in general, growing up in New York I am a huge critic/lover of Italian food. The meatball sub here was nothing short of amazing. I got a kind of \"crunch\"bread that was the right kind of chewy and very tasty. The service was great, everyone working there was friendly. I'm so glad that I found this place on yelp. It's a bit hidden, in an alley off of Mill, but the search was worth it. I'll definitely be making the trip to Tempe from Phoenix to try out the other sandwiches."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot! Delicious sandwiches and fantastic service. The manager, Melissa, was super friendly and incredibly knowledgable of the menu. Thanks Melissa for making our SISTERS lunch date so much fun! You're the best! Btw- My fave is #1/2 The Spiffy Tiffy - so yummy! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Sandwiches are messy deliciousness. They have a happy hour special everyday from 4-7 when you eat in store, get a free bag I chips & drink. They have about 45 sandwich options, most are Halal chicken, steak or veggie. Four bread choices and several additional add ins available. Everyone in store is super friendly and ready to recommend their fav sandwich. My favorite so far is the Mozzarella's Big Cheese. It's chicken, honey, honey mustard, havarta, & provolone cheese.
The onion rings are the only downside I've tried so far. Kinda limp and soggy, I guess their made more to go in the sandwiches rather then as a side."}
{"text":"Awesome menu! So many choices- and so many vegetarian choices! I almost gave it four stars-- the wait time always seems to be a bit long and it's kind of pricey for a sandwich, so definitely not an everyday place to go. But really good overall."}
{"text":"I just had their sandwiches for the second time and I think this is going to become our new sandwich spot. The first time I tried this place I ordered the Menage A Trois and LOVED IT!!! This time I had the Tony Soprano. Both were great! My fiance had the Pat Tillman and he really enjoyed it. 

The sandwiches are a decent size. I tend to not be able to finish a whole one. Although they are a bit pricey, they are worth it!!! From the bread to the ingredients, you can definitely tell it's better quality sandwiches. 

The first time I tried Ike's, I had it delivered. This time, we opted for pickup. Parking is limited so don't be surprised if you have to park and walk a little bit to go get your food. 

Overall-Great Job Ike's!!!"}
{"text":"Overrated. I had been told these sandwiches were \"heaven in food form.\" Not the case.. Don't get me wrong, they're pretty good, but I was severely disappointed. The menage a toi Ike's is famous for was drenched in sauce and just messy. I'm glad I went alone cuz I guarantee that I wasn't pretty eating it lol. Also, kind of weird how narcissistic this Ike man is. Trying to make a brand for himself with his face plastered on the wall, but it is all a little much and the whole rags to riches thing is irrelevant.. I'm here for a sandwich, not your life story and an unmade bow tie, so random. Service was great tho! I really liked everyone working there.

TAKEAWAY: I am definitely going to go back and try something new, but as for now, this place is def overrated and overpriced."}
{"text":"Its usually downtown that I get vegan sandwiches at Green, but today I needed a place close to home. Boy am I glad that I stopped! I had the Vegan Brutus and it was amazing. I am happy to that they offer amazing non-Vegan options for my family and friends that have other diet preferences.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Not sure why all of the 5 Star ratings. Food was just average at best and with price considered it's less then average. Fries were meeh, sandwiches the same and service slow. The only saving grace was the pleasant young man who took the order was both knowledgable and courteous. Too much money and slow delivery, not a good combination.

Removed from my bookmarks, won't be going back."}
{"text":"I can be pretty picky when it comes to sub shops, but I really liked Ike's! I was looking for places good vegan options besides just a vegetable sandwich. The service was good, and they have tons of options!

I was debating whether to get the Vegan Pilgrim or the Vegan Reuben, but went for the Pilgrim on gluten-free bread. It was definitely an interesting and enjoyable sandwich! Though I would want to try the Reuben next time. We went during the happy hour, so we got free chips and a drink. The chips were very delicious. Also a caramel apple pop with every sandwich? Nostalgia! Yes please!"}
{"text":"I love this place! My boyfriend and I go to ASU and we often go for their \"happy hour\" deal. Their happy hour is if you order a sandwich to eat in you get free chips and a drink! It's a really good deal and it's great food. Recently my boyfriend and I went in and the staff was friendly and there was a guy who I didn't recognize as an employee he was offering us free samples of pizza they made to see if they wanted to put it on the menu, we politely declined and he and my boyfriend talked a little while I ordered. When my boyfriend and I went to pay the cashier told my boyfriend that \"Ike had paid for our meal. He came and told me and I was confused but then I noticed the cartoons of Ike on the walls and it made sense. The employee offering samples was Ike! After we received our food we thanked him for our free food and had a small conversation. I haven't had such great customer service in a long time and it just makes me loves this place even more!"}
{"text":"Yea, I wished there was one in VA. Meatless Mike rocked my world. On point! Husband had A Tony soprano and he was happy. Great selection.  Just awesome!!!"}
{"text":"I have to say this place surpassed my expectations.  I had the Nacho Boy sandwich and it was perfect.  I tried the Dutch crunch bread with the sandwich and was perfectly baked.  I will definitely be back! The service was excellent!"}
{"text":"I don't have a clue where to even start with Ike's. Maybe I could start with the crispy yet warm and chewy Dutch Crunch bread or I could possibly begin with the Dirty Sauce. Either way, this place is out of this world. 

I had the opportunity to hear Ike's story and not only does he care about his food, this dude really cares about creating a good environment. There's this blonde girl who is ALWAYS there at this location and she told me she actually transferred out here to help open the store and she's the most friendly person and always greets me like we are best friends. I'll call her \"The Director of First Impressions\". She is a G.

Anyways, do not hesitate to go even out of your way to go to Ike's. The location is not my fave but I can promise you it's worth it!"}
{"text":"This place had good food, and good service, but I won't be back simply because the prices are insane. 

I came in to try the place out for the first time and almost walked out when I saw the prices. I decided to stay and spend a few dollars extra just to try it out, and it was good but still not worth the price. After spending a good 10 minutes looking over their massive menu and deciding what I wanted, I was informed that they were all out of the halal chicken (which ruled out all of the sandwiches that I had been interested in). I ended up going with the Matt Cain at the recommendation of the employee, which came out to a total of $12 JUST for the sandwich! That didn't even include a side or a drink or anything. TBH I know I'm getting old and I have to frequently remind myself that it's not the 90's anymore when you could get a full meal at any fast food place for $5 but damn, $12 is waaaaaay too much for one sandwich even in 2018."}
{"text":"I was impressed with the selection they had. I am not the biggest sandwich fan, however this meal was delicious. They even had a delicious gluten free  bread. I'd recommend this sandwich shop to friends and family."}
{"text":"Ike's has like 200 different subs to choose from. And the prices range from $5 to $26. Honestly, this might be the best sandwich I've had. One of the store bosses, Chase, was kind enough to hook me up with a free sandwich for my first visit. I went with the Damon Bruce. I'm hooked. 

P.S. - They run a daily happy hour in which you get FREE chips and a drink with your sandwich."}
{"text":"Our first Ike'a experience was amazing!  I can't wait to go back.

Their menu is pricey but it's worth it.  They offer so many awesome variations of mouth watering sandwiches."}
{"text":"Went for the first time this week excited to try a sandwich on Dutch Crunch bread after friends from the Bay Area kept raving about it.  The girl at the counter was very friendly and helped me pick from the huge menu.  I wanted a cold-cut sandwich as opposed to a steak or chicken, and she suggested the Tony Soprano (ham, salami, turkey, provolone, italian dressing).  It was happy hour so I got a free drink and chips.  When they brought out the sandwich my first thought was that it was HUGE...but that didn't stop me from eating the whole darn thing!  :)  That dirty sauce on the bread (which tastes like a twist on tzatziki sauce to me) was awesome.  Looking forward to trying other menu items.  I wish there was closer location to my area in NW Valley, but I'll definitely stop by whenever I make a trip to Ikea or other shopping/events in the area.  I must say that I felt it was a tad over-priced considering it was a  $10 sandwich (which normally does not include the drink and chips), but the people, atmosphere, and taste of that sandwich make it worth the visit, especially during happy hour.  If the price point ever gets much higher though, I might reconsider."}
{"text":"Love love love Ike's. Dutch crust is the best and  with so many different sandwich selection it's hard to choose just one have tried several and I do not have a favorites they were all yummy!!"}
{"text":"Ike's is finally in AZ and it was worth the wait. For those of us with celiac or gluten intolerances, Ike's is a fantastic option. They use sandwich rolls from Gluten Free Creations (which is just as good as the Mariposa rolls they use in the Bay Area) and use exclusive GF areas to prepare sandwiches. 

The wait time for making sandwiches, however, is a bit long. They are newly opened though and perfection can't be rushed. You'll definitely want to make time to come check out Ike's!"}
{"text":"Good sandwiches. Certainly more flavor and uniqueness than your average Subway. I suggest going with the Dutch Crunch bread. And it has happy hour which is free drinks and chips from 4pm-7pm. As for the types of sandwiches, there are a lot of variety.

I had the pastrami which is not bad at all. I still could say that it could have used a little more meat. But other than that, it was good. The fries were good too but not sure if it was $5 worth of good. I mean that is almost another sandwich right there. Or extra meat.

Is it the best? I can't say that. Is it good? Yes."}
{"text":"My friend eats here like almost everyday. Got me to eat some sandwiches here too and I gotta say, it's delicious. I think a lot of people think it's delicious too since this place has a 5 STAR rating. haha.

When I was there last time, there were about 20-30 people waiting in line to order sandwiches. And they were willing to wait too. I don't know but the flavor, sauce and texture of the sandwiches are just so GOOD. The sandwiches are huge too! It's probably going to cost you a little more than sandwiches from Subway, PotBelly, Capriotti's, etc.

There's a whole lot of different sandwiches you can order (even vegetarian and gluten free) written on the chalkboard but make sure you get the Dutch Crunch bread. It's really good with a certain crunch to it. I guess you can visit their website for every item on the menu. Oh they give you a caramel apple lollipop too with your sandwich to cleanse your palette. :)

Usually, if you come during non-rush hour times, you don't have to wait in line!"}
{"text":"Best unique sandwich shop in AZ! The decor has a serious identity crisis and  needs makeover but who cares the product is awesome!  Don't let the huge menu be overwhelming as there is something for everyone. I get the Bella sandwich everytime, wonderful if you love honey mustard. My wife always gets the \"going home for Thanksgiving\", she loves the cranberry sriracha sauce. No matter what you have to try the dutch crunch bread... enjoy!"}
{"text":"Amazing gluten free and vegan 'meatball\" sandwich! I am so happy to have found this place. Lots of vegetarian sandwiches that can be made vegan. The the gluten free bread is the best I have had. The staff was great too."}
{"text":"This place is the BEST! I was forced to go gluten free about 1 1/2 years ago due to a health condition and I had yet to find anywhere that I could get a good deli sandwich...Until now. Their gluten free bread was fresh, soft on the inside and had a chewy but slightly crusty outside. It had the consistency of good Italian bread. I got a turkey and ham with my favorite toppings and I have to say you would've never known it was gluten free. My husband, who is not gluten free, also ordered the gluten free bread and he got the Bear Hug sandwich and said it was one of the best sandwiches he's ever had. He's a Phoenix native and said the jalepenos were perfect. We also loved the décor as we were both teenagers in the early 90's. I'm so glad I only have to drive across Mesa to find an excellent sub."}
{"text":"Just got the #2 on sourdough. Is this really the amount of meat you get on a $10 sandwich? Two thin slices? The only reason I give two stars is because the mushrooms are amazing, but jeez.....still not worth it"}
{"text":"These sandwiches are pure genius. I have never seen so many unique combinations between two pieces of bread. I have always wanted to try Ike's place, since I heard so much about it from SF people, that when they opened up only 2 miles from my house, the expectations were set so high. I ordered off the menu from a SF staple, If I were Cute, which has chicken, pesto, bacon, cheddar, and mozz sticks! Of course on dutch crunch with dirty sauce. It was pure heaven. I haven't tried any of their other sandwiches because the continued orgasm from this sandwich still get me. Maybe I'll venture out in the future but for now I have found my love. The staff is beyond awesome. Everyone has a super chipper, positive attitude that you can't just help but let it rub off on you. Now all they need to do is open one in the Chicagoland area!"}
{"text":"Extensive selection of some pretty interesting sandwiches. I have yet to have a sandwich there that wasn't enjoyed. If you're looking for something a little more exciting than a JimmyJohn's, you just found it."}
{"text":"The best sandwiches, so many great combos. They need to stay open later though!"}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches!!! They are huge portions as well. The pricing is more than usually spent on sandwiches for sure but they are worth it form time to time! A ton of options to please anyone, lots of customizable options as well. Definitely recommend the Dutch crunch bread option! Also comes with a apple caramel lollipop which is a nice touch."}
{"text":"Great place...HUGE menu....maybe read it online before you stroll in...or you will stand there like it's 1995 and you are trying to figure out what movie to rent from Blockbuster. 

All our sandwiches were great. Fries were good, nothing special to me. 

Got really busy towards lunch time, very limited seating. Not a bad thing though! Place is booming."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches. Ordered the Madison and the Rueben. Both were served quickly, hot and has distinctive sauces that made the sandwiches delicious. 

Not enough seating and the line to order tended to get backed up. Hello"}
{"text":"Out of the ordinary sandwiches. Large menu display on the door and above the register. Great sandwich, but a bit pricy for the amount of meat included."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty! Sandwiches are huge! Can be easily spilt. The pricing is ridiculously high for sandwiches so I'm giving it a 4."}
{"text":"Amazing food! The subs are huge and very tasty. The atmosphere is cool and the employees are very friendly. I will definitely come back but I will definitely will have to share the sub next time."}
{"text":"I love this place!! There sandwiches are great! My favorite is the Ted Danson, the poppyseed slaw is amazing!! Also, only place that has zapp's chips. Try the voodoo, they're my fav. I usually get the gluten free bread just because it's so tasty, I'm not even gluten free."}
{"text":"The sandwiches were unique and good. The selection was a little overwhelming to some in my group. But everyone was satisfied. The only thing that I didn't understand, was the French fries were going to be added inside the sandwich. I thought it was going to be on the side. I'll keep that in mind, next time."}
{"text":"Ike's is a pretty good spot for lunch. My only complaint is that the size of the sandwiches used to be a lot bigger and was worth the higher price. Don't get me wrong, they use quality ingredients, but when you're used to the larger sandwiches and now get half that size sandwich for the same price it's a huge disappointment. As previously mentioned the ingredients are quality and delicious, I'd just mention that size matters. If you're going to reduce the size of the sandwich, reduce the price!"}
{"text":"I first visited the Mesa store last year (I'm from Orange County) and fell in love instantly. Insanely good food and message of the brand- that's awesome!

Back in AZ recently, I had to go back for a visit. Had some impressions that might help. Food was excellent of course! I noticed only 1 cashier up front- he was short handed. Every table was full, big line and it took me about 15 minutes to get thru to phone in an order. Would recommend staffing up the front. Back of house, 3 cooks looked plenty. 

Also, napkins were out at the soda fountain. Cashier confirmed store had run out of supply. I would've filled all this out on a comment card, but those too were out of stock.

Anyway, keep up the good work. I will still be back and hopefully these are some easy issues to address."}
{"text":"Okay, first of all, do not look through the photos and make a decision about the food. I have to admit that these are not the prettiest of sandwiches around. The main reason for the slight unattractiveness of the sandwiches has to be the amount of delicious flavors squished between two pieces of bread. I mean, I couldn't even pick out what I liked most about my sandwich because it was bursting with deliciousness. 

On my first visit here (and definitely not my last), I tried out the Reading Rainbow. It comes with avocado, cheddar cheese, and Ike's red pesto (which is a pesto with sun-dried tomatoes...so good!). I added tomatoes and red onion to my sandwich and ordered it on the dutch crunch bread. Oh my god, that bread is seriously delicious! Do not order anything else. They also add their dirty sauce to almost every sandwich. I can be a bit of a picky eater and I didn't dislike anything on my sandwich, which means that dirty sauce must've been pretty tasty. I also ordered chips and a drink which were pretty standard. The sandwich comes with a carmel-apple lollipop which I thought was a fun little treat. 

I absolutely have to mention Ike's incredibly diverse menu options. Holy crap they have some serious sandwich selection here! If you're a vegetarian (or just mostly enjoy vegetarian options like me) or if you're a meat eater, you're set. I may have taken at least fifteen minutes to make a decision and I can't wait to try more. They also have awesome gluten free choices. It's pretty much impossible to be disappointed here. 

The character of this place is like none other around town. Mesa just got cooler because of the addition of Ike's. Like waaaaaay cooler. I live about thirty minutes away and it's definitely worth the drive. That being said, I hope they spread to other locations around the valley soon. Like ASAP! The shop is bright and funky and had some sweet nineties tunes playing during my visit. They're not lacking in character here. Oh and did I mention the awesome staff? So friendly and helpful. Chase is doing an awesome job of running the place...his energy is contagious. Ike's is definitely the best sandwich shop I've tried in a long time. 

So the moral of the story, you ask? Get your butt over to Ike's Love and Sandwiches as soon as you can. I don't care if you live in freaking Surprise...it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"Bring Ike's to Tucson!!!! Such a tasty vegan meatball sandwich! Plus, they have gluten free bread. So my husband and I could eat at the same place. The only thing I can say that needs improvement would be updating the summer hours on the website. This location closes at 10pm through the summer. So we just barely made it in time to order our food. Thankfully the staff was super nice and we were able have some dinner."}
{"text":"This place puts any of those big name sandwich places to shame! So many choices and the overall tongue n cheek humor of the place will keep you coming back every time you're close and sometimes when you're not! Don't let any of the kitsch fool you though this is a gourmet level of sandwich artisans putting together your meal here!"}
{"text":"Best sandwiches ever. Don't even need to elaborate... if you're reading this just go get one for yourself.

I get the gluten free bread and it's the best I've ever had. The first time I had a sandwich there I questioned if they got my order right.

Just edited my review to say they've added a kid's menu! This place is perfect :)"}
{"text":"Yummy!  Not your original sandwich shop. So many varieties & the dutch crunch french bread is delicious. 
My son had the Pat Tillman, my husband had the Tony Soprano & I had the Steve Jobs....all were awesome! 

I also get a caramel apple lollipop!"}
{"text":"Ike's is an amazing sandwich shop that could do a lot more business if more people knew about it. Their sandwiches are fresh and come in any style you can possibly imagine. They are also willing to customize the sandwich to make it the way you want it. Until I found Ike's, I had never known what the was like to have my entire family satisfied with a sandwich shop for a meal. I discovered Ike's on a business trip to San Jose, and I was elated when I found out they had a location in Mesa. The service was amazing, and the sandwiches were delicious. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I each got a full sub and a side order of onion rings and a side order of cheese sticks.....came out to $30! 

Came home and opened up our stuff. Sandwiches were mediocre at best and they were so flat with flavor. Sides were garbage. The thing that upsets me the most is there are much better options. I was like I could have gone to Cheba hut for half the price and MUCH better food!

By the way, the onion rings were cold and burnt! We were home in 10 minutes and it shouldn't be soggy and stone-cold. My moz sticks were too expensive, soggy, and cold. Sad moz sticks lol.

Not going back!"}
{"text":"Oh man this place is good...tons of choices, friendly staff, it's kind of like cheba hut on steroids."}
{"text":"So this is my new favorite sandwich place in AZ.  I had heard about it a few times, so it was on my radar, but I didn't realize how freaking good it would be.  I love all the kitschy names for the sandwiches... although you won't find me ordering one named after a SF Giants player! ;)  I ordered the Tony Soprano; turkey, ham, salami, Italian dressing and provolone.  All their sandwiches come with dirty sauce.  My mom ordered the Paul Ruebens and she wasn't sure how the dirty sauce would taste on it, but she loved it.  The moral of the story is- Always get the dirty sauce!  
The service was fantastic.  The girl that brought out our to go order was so friendly and invited us back again.  I loved the classic 90's music playing in the restaurant too.  It's always fun to rock out to New Kids on the Block which waiting for your yummy sandwich."}
{"text":"The only thing I don't always like is the endless options you have to choose for a sandwich. Which isn't all that bad obviously. I love the Matt Cain, Michael Jordan, and others I cannot recall. Anyways  this place is awesome be sure to try it."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches going around!  I normally get this in the Bay Area but this location was pretty good too.  Ike is a legend!"}
{"text":"I was in the area and wanted to find a place to eat lunch that was quick. This was close to my hotel and had great reviews so thought I'd check it out. IT\"S SO GOOD!
I love all the options and the dutch crunch bread is phenomenal.
The sandwiches are pretty big (I couldn't finish mine) but I thought it was cute to get a blow pop with it. I don't remember what sandwich I got (something with turkey) I got but they put the special sauce (sorry I don't remember what it's called exactly) on it and even though I'm not big into sauces on my sandwiches this was really good. 

Reasonable prices, friendly staff, and a good sandwich. I'd definitely come here again if I was near one."}
{"text":"I have got to favorite sandwich shops. Ike's is probably my favorite sandwich shop of all time. My other favorite sandwich shop doesn't have quite as many options but what they do have is legit. Let's talk about what makes Ike's so awesome. Just on the chalkboard alone they have over 500 sandwiches to choose from. All named after goofy people. The most important part of this whole operation is the bread, not just any bread, they have a bread they call  Dutch crunch.  It's amazing! If you become a fan you might want to go online and check out all of the specialty sandwiches that are not listed. My favorite is the \"I think I'm pretty\" it's a chicken sandwich with pesto, bacon, cheese & mozzarella sticks. throw it on the Dutch crunch bread-Boom! I was just in there the other day and found out they are starting to carry Sprecher. Do you know what that means? Now you can have the best root beer from Wisconsin and the best sandwich in Arizona all at the same time. Enjoy my friends!"}
{"text":"Last night was the 2nd time my wife and I have eaten here. The food always looks and smells good; however, both times we have come down with food poisoning. I don't know if it's their sauce or just the food but we hadn't tried it for 3-4 months from the last time only to get it again. I would suggest staying away unless you have time to deal with the aftermath."}
{"text":"Decided to visit this place because my wife and I heard it practically had a cult following. 

With a 5 star average review it has to be good. I ended up getting the Tony Soprano and my wife grabbed the Bella. First off the online photos do not due justice to the size of this sandwich. It may be 8 inches but it's practically 4 inches across. We both could have done with sharing one sandwich. They both were delicious. 

We also had their fries of which we were much less impressed. There wasn't really any seasoning...healthy though since they're baked. 

Well definitely visit again but recommend skipping the fries."}
{"text":"If u want to experience a sub shop built in heaven you must come here and arrive hungry menu is so large they can't fit it on the wall,  over 400 sandwiches so u will have to devote a full year of your life to experience it, 

Ordered
201 Adam Richmond - the avocado in the sandwich made it really good
444 bear hug - the jalenopenos made the sandwich

I got 398 more subs to try I'm coming back"}
{"text":"Great place for a quick bite and fit my criteria for a place to eat: fits the budget, has to make me full, at least 4 stars on yelp, and of course tasty. This place hit all the marks everytime I come and visit. This place never goes wrong especially in the endless amount of sandwiches to choose from, and as for myself I'm always feeling adventurous I have tried at least 3 (times visited) of there sandwiches. Overall I guess you just can't go wrong from there veggie to meat choices.  Just a quick tip try there Dutch bread you can never go wrong! Enjoy and munch on!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had a great visit here. We simply weren't prepared for how wonderful their gluten free sandwiches were. I actually asked our server if these were really gluten free or had they made a mistake. The rolls were slightly warmed and crisped perfectly  I had the Bella sandwich and it was sublime. Thank you for catering to so many groups of people!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since the first Ike's opened in Mesa. At that time this Place was really good, and I got to meet Ike a few times. However, he needs to come visit this location, as I haven't been here for almost a year.

I called in a couple sandwiches and they first messed up my order. This was fine, they were able to make me a fresh sandwich of my actual order (the spiffy tiffy). 

I originally wanted to give this place 5 stars as I normally would, but this time it was very hard to give more than 1. The quality of the food has really declined at this location. I'm trying to give them the benefit of the doubt, but my sandwich, the spiffy tiffy, was lacking in flavor and was super greasy (left me super bloated). I might give this location another shot, but I think Ike needs to come pay a visit."}
{"text":"Amazing amazing amazing. 
Order the Damon Bruce. 

Been coming to the Westwood CA for years.  It was my fav sandwich shop. Moved to AZ to find Ike's here aswell. I drive 30 minutes out of my way for Ike's consistently.  

Don't think about it. Go here."}
{"text":"Very tasty sandwiches, but they are huge.  The service was great, the guy behind the counter helped guide me through the menu which is also huge.  I was impressed and will return"}
{"text":"Ike's is our new favorite sandwich spot! The customer service is unbelievable, Marcus was helpful, patient and just plain nice to myself and my brother in law. We ordered the Paul Ruben and the Adam Richmond. Both delicious but if I had to pick my favorite between the two, it'd be the Paul Ruben. Pastrami heaven. 
Thank you for coming to Tempe, Ike's. We love you, you're beautiful, it's true. Can't wait to try something different next time, maybe the ASU Sundevil or one of the veggie choices. 
P.S. These sandwiches are huge, big enough to share or get two meals out of. I also love that they have unique sodas, like butterscotch or real cola and Voodoo flavored chips. Plus, you get a caramel apple pop with your sandwich, brilliant! I wish more companies believed in such a unique motto. Be silly, be nice and don't be afraid to be different. They have cute sayings in all the napkin holders, like \"tell someone they're beautiful\" and on the door \"to our lovely customers.......\". I live my life in this sweet, karmic sort of way and believe that even the smallest things, like these, can make someone's day. Kindness is contagious and can make or break any experience. Marcus knows what's up. 
To Ike and the staff, never change. Love, peace and silly geese."}
{"text":"I was a first time visitor today, and I have to say this place did not disappoint! The food is incredible!!!! I had the chicken, coleslaw, avocado, and french dressing on the Dutch Crunch bread. I would absolutely order this again!

BUT....this place is very overpriced! I paid $12.00 for my sandwich. I did add Avocado, but $12.00? That will keep people from coming back."}
{"text":"Eco-friendly, bring your own cup, lots of veggie options."}
{"text":"Had our first two sandwiches at a Rockies vs Angels game at salt river fields...wow!
Will be looking for them here and the SF Bay Area!  It was great there was a super nice guy giving out samples as we went in, or I wouldn't have tried them out.  LOVE the Dutch crunch bread--both the roast beef and bbq chicken were fantastic--I think all their sandwiches are warmed, so the cheese melts, etc.  Glad they are coming to Sacramento soon!"}
{"text":"Pretty awesome.  All different kinds of sandwiches.  Definitely not a healthy choice, but great for satisfying a big appetite."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sandwich shop! Their employees are always so friendly and accommodating. I drive to this location just for their special sandwich \"I Dream of Jeanie\" on French Bread with Voodoo Chips. (You also receive a caramel apple lollipop) I highly recommend this shop for anyone eating with a group of people with meat eaters, vegetarians and vegans as they offer delicious sandwiches for everyone. Or go by your one-some during Happy Hour for $5 sandwiches out of the cold case!"}
{"text":"We tried this based on a Yelp experience and we have gone back multiple times. Great food, great people, very fun experience and did I mention good food? Huge selection ams they have all been good so far! Does not disappoint."}
{"text":"Cain Velasquez on sourdough - Now that's what I'm talkin about! It's the real deal pastrami sandwich with bacon, swiss and Ike's special garlic aioli sauce. These sammy's are not for wimps! It's for foodies like myself who appreciate food, all kinds of food...and lots of it. I ordered my Cain Velasquez with avocado - cause I'm from Cali and that's just how we roll; don't sleep on these sandwiches folks; they're pretty amazing! I was in Heaven because they sell Zapp's potato chips, Key Lime and Cream Soda. Took me back to all those vacations in Nawlins when I'd pig out on catfish & shrimp po-boys and Zapp's. Made me feel right at home. 

Not sure how I paid $18 for a Sammy & some chips...but the sandwiches must be made with crack...so, I'll be back tomorrow for the Menage A Trois (BBQ Sauce, Cheddar, Halal Chicken, Honey Mustard, Pepper Jack, Real Honey, Swiss) or Adam Richman (Avocado, Fried Chicken, Ham, Pesto, Real Honey, Swiss).

These are some of the best sandwiches ever! I just wish we had Ike's in San Diego:("}
{"text":"Ike's seriously has the best sandwiches I've ever eaten. The dutch crunch bread is the best and the halal chicken sandwiches are amazing.

I work right across from there so its really hard for me to walk past Ike's and have lunch somewhere else. The sandwiches are really big (they used to be bigger!), so it covers lunch and dinner for like 10 bucks. 

The options are multifold and they can make sandwiches that are not on the menu as well. I never get tired of eating here and I'm always sad after I finish my sandwich :("}
{"text":"I tried this place on a whim and some Yelp help. Absolutely happy I did!

The sandwiches are phenomenal. They have the best warm sandwiches I have ever had in the valley. I am partial to anything with pastrami so I find myself ordering the Paul Reuben or the Thunderbird. Their steak and chicken sandwiches are great as well. Even a carnivore like me found myself ordering a veggie sandwich just for kicks... And I loved it!

Don't be fazed by their menu. Take a few minutes or browse online before going. They have a lot to offer and I find myself wanting to try new types of sandwiches. The fries are great and there's enough for about 2-3 people per order. 

Now... Their bread is a whole other story. I am a fan of SF sourdough (is their any other type? Lol) and this place will not disappoint. They have what they call \"Dutch Crunch.\" It's basically a white type of bread with an awesome crispy crunch. I really can't find words for it but it is awesome. The texture and flavor will have you craving more. 

Service is very friendly and FAST. And you get one of my favorite treats for dessert, a caramel-apple pop! 

The only con I found with this place is the amount of seats. There's about 8-9 booths and 3-4 indoor tables and they always seem to be packed (a good sign!)."}
{"text":"It just got better - the young staff is friendly and energetic - singing or something close bellows from the kitchen. The place is clean and the subs (I've only been twice and tried two so far), are exceptional.  Love the crunchy Dutch bread, the halal meats appear to be of high quality as do all the add-ons.  $8.88 something or other with chicken I had today was thick and filling and delicious.  Only 30 or 40 offerings shown on the menu board - literally 100s more shown on the online menu.  So exceptionally good I'll make the effort to at least occasionally get to their new downtown Phoenix location.  Really, really good.  Pardon the lack of detail on exactly what I had today, but after starting off with a \"Menage a trois\" (sub) on my first visit, the other names are less memorable."}
{"text":"Walked in at 12:39, one person in front of me, no one at counter, 5 employees in kitchen. No one greeted me, or others that walked in after me. Customer ordered at 12:43 and order taker went back to kitchen, after saying I'll be with you. 12:47, took my order in a harried fashion. Seems that the order taker also has to distribute sandwiches. Not very ed efficient, in my mind, at least at lunch time."}
{"text":"A tiny sandwich shop tucked away in downtown Tempe with a dizzying number of hand-crafted sandwiches.

We just asked the friendly college kid at the counter for his recommendations to make things easier. I got the \"ménage a trios\" (shredded chicken, three kinds of cheese, BBQ sauce) and my wife the \"ted danson\" (turkey, coleslaw and Swiss). We also got the house special \"Dutch crunch\" bread.

It took only a few minutes and our two massive sandwiches were ready (note to self-there are some half sandwiches for next time).  The sandwiches were nicely toasted and very tasty. Sort of a local, stepped-up version of pot belly with a much larger number of choices.

A fast and tasty lunch."}
{"text":"Returned again for lunch got same thing number 2 great again , had a friend mis order his food , manager took care of it and returned difference in price of what he ordered and wanted without asking !!!! Tucker is a good dude , try this place out great"}
{"text":"Hands down the best sandwich/sub shop and I don't even like most sandwiches! Jaymee Sirewich and Ménage a Trois sandwiches are literally HEAVEN  Ike's is a must if you're ever out west, I crave it all the time since I live on the east coast. 10/10 place."}
{"text":"Been here twice now and I will be a regular for sure! Their sandwiches are huge and messy.  They have 50-some sandwiches on the menu here. (I am told there are over 400 sandwiches if you combine the menu from every location, and they will make any of these sandwiches on request.) A whole sandwich is too much food for one setting, but they taste so good you will eat it anyway! They play really cool 90s music and from 3-7 everyday you get a free combo meal for the price of your sandwich.  Hell yes!"}
{"text":"So many sandwich choices it's a bit overwhelming. The sandwiches are a bit too saucy for me but asking for light sauce is good. And the Dutch crunch bread is amazing."}
{"text":"I love the sauce they use in their sandwiches. Dutch Crunch is a great choice if bread."}
{"text":"$16-$20 for a combo. Not worth it at all. Spend that money doing something productive like buying groceries and then making sandwiches yourself instead of giving this place an arm and a leg."}
{"text":"Best sandwich shoppe we've been to in a while.  Glad we stumbled on it while searching for something to eat.  The staff were great and gave us great recommendations.  This will be our go to place when we visit the Phoenix area again!"}
{"text":"Their subs are the best, I wish they sold their Dutch bread l, I would buy the lot. It is crispy but sweet, and the options for subs range over 200 combinations! Each store is unique, try it out!"}
{"text":"I have fallen in love with the options this place has. Try their home made bread with anything and you will love it. Its messy so don't wear something formal!!"}
{"text":"Fabulous sandwiches. Great twist of different flavors and just the right amount of each flavor. There were 3 in our party and we all got different sandwiches. They were all fantastic!!"}
{"text":"C'mon guys, admit these sandwiches are laced with pure crack and bath salts. I won't tell. Srsly, I don't even live in Phoenix but if I go there for work I make a point to stop. Gluten free bread is fabulous. People are nice. What else do you want, a free bike?"}
{"text":"The quality is amazing. The flavor of all the ingredients all come together perfectly. There are endless choices to pick from, and even more if you go online! The staff is wonderful and will help you pick a sandwich choice if you can't come to a conclusion. While the price is a little on the higher side, it is so worth the price!"}
{"text":"Glad to see Ike's doing well. Had the Madison Bumgarner on the Dutch Crunch bread. It was good."}
{"text":"My favorite sandwich place of all time! Pricey but who cares! Excellent. Their sandwiches are addicting. They have a dirty sauce that is amazing. I'm not even a huge fan of sandwiches. This place rocks. Even got my kids addicted ! Only thing is, it's gets really busy!!"}
{"text":"They have an excellent selection of VEGAN sandwiches with yummy vegan sauces! The staff was very friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"Checked this place out over the weekend. I had noticed it a few days ago and decided to check out a menu online and I was amazed at all of their vegan options. I went in without a clue in the world on what to eat. The staff was extremely helpful and patient with my inability to make up my mind on which sandwich I wanted. I got the vegan meatball sandwich and it was delicious! They were out of Daiya cheese but the sandwich was great without it! I have to say I am blown away by how great the customer service was. This place is AWESOME! I really hope that this place sticks around because almost everything around them has closed down. Great food, great service!"}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly. The food tasted great. A little pricey for the sandwich size. Also the ratio of meat toppings to bread was way off. They need to put some more stuff in the sandwich, especially for those prices."}
{"text":"Wonderful place.  So many items to choose from.   Even their vegetarian menu is extensive.   Hundreds of different sandwiches.  Their Dutch crunch bread is the Bomb.  A go to place if you are in Mesa.  I'll be sure return."}
{"text":"Ordered #38 the count of monte crust o. Turkey, ham and strawberry preserves. I added bacon to round it out. The house roll is good and the sandwich hit the spot. Only draw back the dude making my sandwich was wearing a tank top and looked like he just walked in from the gym."}
{"text":"Okay so I have heard of this place for years and did not realize it was so close by. We ordered three different sandwiches and they were all delicious! The Dirty Sauce comes on all every sandwich so if garlic is not your thing be sure to ask questions. 
The service is the place is amazing. The guy taking our order was friendly and never once rushed us through the line. 
If and when you take the trip here give yourself time to read through their menu as they have a lot to offer.

They also play great music."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best sandwich place that I've ever been to. There is a sandwich for everyone. The Dutch crunch bread is soooo good. I love coming here... the staff is great. Such a chill sandwich place! Trust me eat here!!"}
{"text":"You're trying to go here for a sandwich? REALLY?! A sandwich you can make at home? Are you SERIOUS?! ... 

Well get serious,because you should DEFINITELY should go here to get a sandwich here's why as you keep reading. 
First & foremost this location is on a corner of a strip mall, nice big sign that you can see, indoor & out door seating are an option here. (who doesn't like to eat outside)

Area: The atmosphere is relaxed, bursting with surprising tunes that just had everyone in the store jamming. When we entered it was no customers but one family already eating, unfortunately for some reason the tables were STILL dirty. When no customers are available, that is the time to set up your shop in a cleaner manner. That was disappointing to me & it shows they don't care about the appearance where the customers eat. Makes you wonder do they care about the area in which they are preparing the food. Seating was nice, booths and tables for two are available. 


 Food: Two Matt Cains were ordered, and one side drink, and one bag of chips. Another free bag came with a Yelp coupon.  (TIP OF THE DAY) The food was absolutely GREAT and well prepared (How can you mess up a sandwich). The combination of flavors are so perfectly meshed together, it's unbelievable how good this sandwich was & I want one just thinking about it. 

Service: the man at the counter was 5 star rating in my opinion he loves his job and you won't leave the counter without him adding his input to make sure you get what your taste buds crave. He was definitely apart of the experience and a great addition to this place. 

I really want to give this place 5 stars because the food was just excellent, but unfortunately the price was ridiculous. My ending bill was over 20 bucks, sure multiple meats were involved and my sandwich was warm  but to me personally it doesn't warrant the price. Especially if you're buying separate drinks, you're just buying a sandwich. I'm from Chicago where GREAT sandwich's come with great buying value that includes something extra such as maybe one bag of chips or a pop. EVERYTHING here had to be purchased separately, the chips(which were bomb) & a beverage. 

To me personally, that is just not consumer friendly. 
Cleanliness, price and value warrants my rating. 
I recommend going here, it's worth the bite."}
{"text":"I consider myself a sandwich expert. I live for sandwiches. Every town I've lived in i make it my mission to find the best sandwich shop in town. This was my first stop since moving to Tempe, and I do not think I will ever go anywhere else. Such delicious. Much awesome. So tasty.
I got the Phil Mickelson and it was almost a spiritual experience. I developed a relationship with my sandwich and cried when it was gone."}
{"text":"The best sandwich ever exists here! I've tried a couple of them and so worth the extra time on the treadmill. The Dutch bread is so yummy - I don't know how it's made - but it's like crack."}
{"text":"This place is really good, like, really good. So I've been here about 3 times now, each trying a different sandwich to see if they can keep a consistent \"good\" with me. They do not disappoint.

When you first walk in, odds are you are going to be greeted with 90's or early 2000's music, which gives it a nice vibe. On the walls is the menu, which doesn't even have every sandwich they can make which you can find online, just tell them the sandwich and they can probably make it. The nice thing about this place is that they have multiple types of bread to choose from. They also have their special \"Dutch Crunch\" that I highly recommend.

The first sandwich I tried was the \"Adam Richman\". The second sandwich I tried was the \"Nacho Boy\" and the third sandwich I tried was the \"Kryptonite\". The main thing these three sandwiches have in common is that all the ingredients work well together, everything blended perfectly!
The Adam Richman had Avocado, Fried Chicken, Ham, Pesto, Swiss, and Honey. Yes, Honey. The honey worked amazingly with the sandwich, adding a nice sweet tinge to a normally salty sandwich, making the salty sweet combo work well.
The Nacho Boy had Avocado, Mushrooms, Roast Beef, and Swiss. This one was a little more basic, however the simplicity worked well and the creaminess of the avocado made this sandwich a lot more savory.
Finally, however not last, is the Kryptonite. This sandwich was really big. A $26 sandwich containing practically all of their meats and toppings and appetizers jam packed into a sandwich. It was so big they had to give me two full sandwiches stuffed with the stuff. Normally, jamming everything into one sandwich doesn't spell success, but this place did it well. Everything down to the sauce worked together to make something delicious. I'll probably get another one pretty soon!

Try this place out, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I looooooove this place.  They have this one with honey and bbq sauce and chicken that is truly divine.  Skip the air fries, they're pale in comparison."}
{"text":"Holy cow. I never would have imagined a sandwich shop could blow me away the way Ike's has, but here we are. 

   The menu is expansive... like HUGE, with a ridiculous amount of options to fully include vegetarian and vegan, plus the staff I've encountered so far have been friendly to the point of a bit of fawning happening. The portions are ENORMOUS, I'm a big fella and can only eat half of a sandwich, thankfully they are delicious heated up the next day, and if you go during happy hour you get free chips and a drink with you sandwich, dope. 

   I discovered Ike's on Sunday, came back again Monday, and fully intend to try to convince my wife to go again today (Tuesday). You are missing out if you have not been to Ike's yet. Seriously"}
{"text":"Love their sandwiches. They have a huge  menu with everything type of sandwich. And very friendly staff too.. they don't rush you through the order.. suggest and help you customize your sandwich in any way you want.

Vegan and vegetarian friendly place."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are really good! The chips and drink choices aren't very good, if they had a better selection they would be the best sandwich shop around hands down. The Stephan Jenkins and Steph Curryone on Dutch Crunch bread are brilliant choices!"}
{"text":"The food is awesome! (Try the bear hug it's ridiculously good) It's a bit on the pricey side but you definitely get what you pay for. One sandwich is more than enough for two people to share. 

I really like the decor of the place and the counter girl, Jessica I think her name is, is so awesome. It's nice to see someone so excited about their job :)

I really hope it sticks around for a long time."}
{"text":"One word to described the sandwiches here and it's AMAZING!!!!!!
I love the fact that they have options for everyone gluten-free, vegan, and vegetarian! It makes this a great spot you could take any one to! 
I'm not sure if it's their bread that makes the sandwiches so delicious but the bread might as well be made of crack! 
I'm a vegetarian so I tried my very first ever marinara meatless meat ball Sammy and wow, it's my favorite so far!"}
{"text":"Pros:
Big portion for each sandwich
Entertaining menu with lots of variety
Vegetarian options
Halal options
Dessert sandwiches
Tasty and fresh
Complimentary lolli

Cons:
Wait time
More expensive than the average sandwich
Sitting areas uncomfortable"}

{"text":"terrible dry sandwich , just a mess of bar b q sauce and stale bread. the stone cold onion rings still had onion skin on them so they were un edible.i rarely ever send back my food for a refund but i couldn't eat this , ummm 9 dollar sandwich that ended up costing twelve dollars because the happy hour deal was no charge ? lol i'd never go back. the cashier pushed a tip bucket towards me so i had to reach around it to pay by card, for the short time i was there it's an apparent job skill to beg for tips. pay her more or send her packing car sales is in her future."}
{"text":"Drooling  Had it for the first time a few weeks ago and I'm hooked!! Can't wait to get my husband over there. My 3 year old son loved his as well. By far the best sandwich place I have ever been to! Ugh... now I need a sandwich!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, however they do seem slightly pricey to me. The location is a little ducked off but its a hidden gem. However there does always seem to be a little bit of a wait, but it is worth it."}
{"text":"I came here again hoping for a better experience than before and was sadly mistaken. I made the mistake of ordering the dutch crunch bread which both my sister and I agreed was not good. It is very doughy (almost floury) and has no flavor. The sandwich I got had salami, turkey, dirty sauce, cheese, and roast beef in it and my sisters had mushrooms, steak, and cheese.it looked delicious, but the same as before, the flavors just weren't right. The ingredients themselves are fresh and delicious but the flavors don't meld together correctly. 

The voodoo chips were also a let down. I expected them to have very robust vinegar and barbecue flavors but there was not. 

I want to like this place but it is overrated and overpriced. The three stars are for service and that my sister seemed to like her sandwich"}
{"text":"Although not the least expensive sandwich on the planet.. Ik'e s is up there with best I have ever had.. The bread is fantastic, and the combination of ingredients are ingenious."}
{"text":"I ordered the Cougar and I think I died and went to heaven after that first bite...there really isn't much else I need to say. The place was clean, service was fast and friendly, food was delicious. I highly recommend and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a long time and finally made it here today. I appreciated the variety of vegetarian choices and it was hard to choose. I asked the cashier and she told me the popular one is \"sometimes I'm a vegetarian\" but I ordered Pirates of the Caribbean instead, which included vegan chicken, orange glaze and pepper jack cheese. I like it, but it would've been better if it was spicier. I like that they have sourdough bread as an option, and unfortunately I didn't notice their 1/2 sandwich special until after I ordered, so I'll have to come back to get that or come to their happy hour 4-7pm everyday and all day Sunday. Pretty cool place and there's something for everyone. The staff was nice as well. Good location in the brickyard at ASU and hope they continue doing well. Ps they have halal chicken and the only pork they serve is their bacon. Even the ham is made from turkey."}
{"text":"I liked the variety of sandwiches available.  My mom and I each got something different and then traded a half so we could sample a couple of them.  By far my favorite thing was the fried zucchini with pesto dipping sauce.  The zucchini was perfectly fried deliciousness and the pesto was fresh and wonderful.  The girls at the register were friendly, but they did miss a couple of special requests we made.  In their defense, we were new to Ike's and asking lots of questions.  The mistakes in our order weren't bad enough to complain about or send back the food.

Ultimately, the reason I'm rating Ike's 4 stars and not 5 is price.  We felt it was a bit pricey for sandwiches, although they are huge.  Two people could easily split one.  So if you're a penny pintcher like me, bring a friend and share a sandwich."}
{"text":"Found this place after a recommendation from a friend and it was definitely worth the trip. So many great sandwiches to choose from. I ended up going with the Bella on Dutch Crunch bread, but be sure to order it with bacon. It's so good. I really like that all of the sandwiches come with a Carmel Apple lollipop too. It's a little off the beaten path, but definitely worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Being a huge Golden State Warriors fan, I have read tweets about this place because both Harrison Barnes and Stephen Curry have had sandwiches named after themselves. I was super stoked to find out that there was one of these in town.

I had the MILF, which I can only assume that the derivative of its name came from its equal desirability to its predecessor. FREAKING AMAZING buffalo chicken, ranch, amazing jalapeño poppers all stuffed in the most amazing bread ever called the Dutch Crunch or something like that. The bread alone is incredible and is nice and crunchy yet pretty much melts in your mouth. 

I can't wait to get back there and try something else!"}
{"text":"I love Ike's don't get me wrong, I just had my first experience at the Tempe location and was super impressed. However I stopped in at the Mesa location today and was not very pleased. 

I had ordered a side of beer battered zucchini, but I never got it. After eating my sandwich I went up to the front to ask the cashier who was on the phone while I waited about 5 minutes, and when another employee walked by and as we made eye contact I said, \"hey man I think they forgot about my order of fried zucchini..\" And then he proceeded to blow right past me and completely ignored me.

Moral of the story is, I paid for food that I never got and when I tried to bring it to their attention I got absolutely blown off. I'm not the type of person that appreciates paying for something I never get. 

Ike's is amazing, you should definitely check it out, but go a little further to a different location to get the good food AND good service."}
{"text":"I love trying new veggie sandwiches and am always hoping the next one will top the last.  I decided to go with the Favorite Sesame Street Name, or #36.  It started off really good and tasty, but after a few bites, the dirty sauce got to be a bit much.  Overall, the sandwich wasn't bad and I'd probably return, but next time I'd love to try the hilal chicken."}
{"text":"Just as good as the one in the Mission.  This place is an institution with no bad choices on the menu, especially if you order your sandwich on dutch crunch.  I can't wait to head back!"}
{"text":"Literally THE best sandwiches. The Dutch crunch bread is what makes these sandwiches so special and delicious. I've never been disappointed with any of the sandwiches I've tried. Plus the customer service is always welcoming and just an added bonus to the food. I would recommend Ike's to anyone looking for a great bite to eat! It's a little pricey for a sandwich place but absolutely worth every penny."}
{"text":"Second visit in a week. I can't think of eating anywhere else! I think they put an addictive chemical in their delicious sandwiches that makes me crave it nightly! This time I tried the Tony Soprano and it did not disappoint. Again amazing bread and great deli meats. Great blend of flavors from the meat, Italian dressing and dirty sauce. I also tried the Funky Fusion chips and they were amazing! I have no idea what the flavor is, maybe BBQ and vinegar? They are so good an extremely addictive. Funky Fusion is a perfect name. 
I can't wait to eat there again!"}
{"text":"Very filling . Their full sandwiches are huge and very tasty. They have an extended menu and I ordered a sandwich with habanero sauce and dutch bread . Worth going back again"}
{"text":"Wow...my God...what on earth did I just stumble upon??  So, I was flying over late from Denver to Phoenix and just wanted to grab a quick bite on my way to my hotel.  KA-BAM!  Why is it I continue to find these great little nuggets around the Tempe area??  Every time I visit here, I keep finding these amazing local little places serving up incredibly delicious eats!!

And dear God...Ike's is quite possibly one of the best sandwiches I've ever eaten!!!  
No lie.  

So I must add...the three young kids (youn adults...forgive me) working at Ike's tonight we're beyond incredible...in fact, let's just call them awesome.  They all, and I mean all three of them added a bit of warmth and sincerity to my experience - something you just don't see very often...(right Aldo?). Lol

Anyway...Ike - please give these kids a raise!!  Well, not to assume you're not paying them well- just recognize that you are very blessed to have such an enthusiastic and creative crew of workers.  I really can't get over at how frigg'en friendly and helpful they here to me tonight...seriously.  They came out from behind the counter, went over the menu with me, made solid suggestions but only after qualifying me (again, another anomaly) and then, they all did their part making me this amazing amazing work of art - wow. I'm so mad at myself for not getting their names - they truly need to be recognized!!  They were just great kids - period!  

I went with a homegrown half pastrami and half turkey sandwich on their French Roll...one side was dressed with their god father sauce and the other had this garlic aioli...both extremely yummy and All homemade of course.  A little tomato and onion and trust me, this ship just found its harbor...into the belly it went!

I'm stuffed, I'm happy, my belly hurts cause I ate waaaaaay too much but again, I'm very very very happy!!  That was a great sandwich - thank you Baby Jesus...

This is the type of sandwich and experience that one just doesn't get very often, or ever...for that matter - I can't wait to go back!!!  

Please open one in New Mexico!!  Please??"}
{"text":"I've heard about Ike's and my family from SF raved about it. Yeah..they hyped it up too much for me. The crunch bread thing was good. It wasn't to die for or worth swearing by. There are a lot of sandwiches to choose from on their menu and online. It's cool they will make a sandwich from any other Ike's store in country.

This would have received 3 stars but they gave us a lot of samples of their sandiwches, so here is another for giving me more food... (yeah, i am easily pleased)"}
{"text":"Just found this place. One in Tempe near Mill. One in Mesa near the fiesta Mall. 

Fantastic!  I have only been twice--in the last two days.  They make their own bread (Dutch crunch).  There are about 500 options.  The onion rings are great. 

Good prices. About $10.  Great food.   And they top it off with a free Carmel covered apple sucker.  Nice!

I will update with upcoming visits.  Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Best sandwich in town!  Great for leftovers - they are huge!  *DUTCH CRUNCH!!!!*"}
{"text":"Aside from their amazing sandwiches  (try the Sometimes I'm Vegan with shredded chicken on Dutch Crunch), the service is always great.

 Today the service was amazing. There was a lil issue with my order and when it was brought to Kelseys attention, she truly went above and beyond. I am very appreciative for the quality restaurant Ikes is and will def be coming back again and again. Thank you Kelsey for being so amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Are you kidding me? This place is real? 
Of course it has a million reviews and 5 stars. There is something for every single person on this planet to enjoy. When the worker found out I had never been there, she mentioned that they make over 400 sandwiches. Four. Hundred. Holy. Crap. 
They have tons of vegetarian options, plenty of unique combos and then the basic stuff as well. If theres one thing (okay, theres many) that Adam Richman has taught me, its that the basic dish is the best way to judge a restaurant. Yes, I went with the boring turkey avocado. 
The lady working there recommended a crunchy bread and had my sandwich out to me in less than 3 minutes. First... it was the size of my head. Massive amounts of food is a big plus in my book. 
The sandwich itself was great. Perfect ratio of meat, bread and lettuce. And the avocado was fresh. None of that crazy bottled crap. 
My only regret is that I didn't get it \"dirty\". They'll put mozzarella sticks and jalapeño poppers on it. Oh. My. Heck."}
{"text":"These guys have got to get it together.   Called in my order around 11:10 was told to be there by 11:35.  I showed up at about 11:30.  The staff had zero idea what was going on.  I saw this poor staff member visit this lady and 4 kids at least a handful of times.  Apparently, they gave my sandwiches or something.. I was confused myself watching this all go down.  

Finally, at 12:00 I got my sandwiches mind you it was myself, one other take out order and the lady with the 4 kids in the restaurant.  I got a Bella on dutch bread, it was pretty good.  But, like other reviewers said the filling to bread ratio was off.  Sandwiches were large but mostly bread so I'm not understanding why these sandwich costs so much.  I am always turned off by restaurants that have overcomplicated menus and found the descriptions a little vague for first timers.  I do like the unusual selection.  Maybe I'll try another location until these guys can get it together... or skip it all together and hit up Capriottis."}
{"text":"Love this place! Good quality ingredients and great quantity! The staff was also friendly too even though the store was busy."}
{"text":"One of the best and most creative sandwich shops around! Extremely friendly staff, personally remember me and my group by name and our orders. Even ran into Ike himself, who's a rockstar! Hey Ike, Garrett should manage the new downtown location."}
{"text":"I had the Matt Cain. Best sandwich I've ever had. Dutch crunch bread was awesome. Very crowded but line moves quickly."}
{"text":"Yum! Garlic aioli is the off da chain! Ham and cheddar never tasted so good!
Must. Try. Everything!"}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp we found this gem. Great sandwiches with cool names. Fresh bread and quick service. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is so great! The people who work there are really friendly and helpful and the food is amazing! I was looking at a menu from their San Francisco location online and found a sandwich I really wanted to try (the Love Triangle) only to realize it wasn't on the Tempe menu. But they said they could make it for me anyway! They could make anything so long as they had all the ingredients. So just an fyi their menu is a lot broader than just what's on the board and they have tons of great vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options! As well as regular bread and meat items. I will absolutely be going back and recommending this place to my friends!"}
{"text":"Wow! The quality of bread, choices of protein, veggie, toppings and sauces, *kerpow*. Had a menage trois sandwich, the crispy dutch bread and cheeses, divine. Good texture, not mushy. The  Ted Danson is sliced turkey on a sourdough bread that you could taste the bread! Adequate fillings of ingredients to balance their awesome bread.

We ordered it at the window. Get a chip for a yelp check in. Order person at window very sweet."}
{"text":"Hidden in a little corner of downtown tempe it's this great sandwich place.  The cashier was so patient to explained how the chicken is made . We went at happy hour time (from 4-7pm) and it included the chips and drink.  After reading some of the reviews here we decided to go with one sandwich for two people and it is true! They are perfect for 2. 

Great atmosphete.."}
{"text":"My Fiance ordered this place on Postmates today . We used to enjoy cheeba hut and other sandwich places but started feeling let down. This place really changed that. They have fun sandwiches that let you customize them as well. The bear hug and the switch were the two we got and wow. Great quality! Amazing , fresh taste.  We Will order again!"}
{"text":"Bay area based sandwich shop that has expanded into Arizona. I have NEVER been disappointed with anything I've ordered at Ike's Menage a Trois was the first sandwich I tried at the Oakland A's Spring training stadium, then the Damon Bruce, the Paul Reubens, and today's new adventure - the Blocked, with green pesto.
Service is always friendly. Sandwiches take a little while to make, not a quickie Subway sandwich here. The price is significantly higher than a Subway sandwich, but it's quite made up for in taste, size, and quality. The decor is kind of dated, but no biggie. The music is usually blaring 90s and early 2000s R&B...always throwback music that brings back good memories.
Dirty sauce and Dutch Crunch Roll, PHEN OM EN AL!"}
{"text":"10/10 will come back. In town from Texas for a couple of days and was looking for a good veggie spot. Wait staff is fast, friendly, and very helpful. Sandwiches are pretty large in size and well worth the money. Try the Dutch-crunch bread!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars if I could, Ike's is an awesome sandwich chain and this location is great as well. My favorite from a novelty perspective is the Matt Cain (#18) -- the halal chicken, avocados, bacon, and sesame dressing really come together well inside their \"dutch crunch\" bread. Service was fast and friendly, and Marko at the register was super personable and helpful to everyone. Would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I've been to Ike's quite a few times and I have never been disappointed. I've tried a variety of the sandwiches, which always are full of meat and veggies. My only complaint is getting to this Mill ave location is tough around lunch time for parking."}
{"text":"Super bomb sandwichs. Great selection. Get the Shawn Michaels add Thunderbird sauce, it's not on the menu but trust me on this. Thank me later."}
{"text":"Another hipster sandwich shop where the menu is to \"inspired\" for me. I just wanted a turkey sammie. Of course I was able to get it, and it was good, its just wading through the eclectic menu is a little much. But if you wanna get wild with your lunch, go to Ike's"}
{"text":"The wait was far less than I expect of this place, even during the lunch rush. Ordered one of my favorites, the Adam Richman, fried chicken, ham, pesto, swiss and avocado. They have far more sandwiches than is possible to post on the menu board, but you can see them online. Another one to try is the Rockstar Wife. It comes with country fried steak, avocado, and \"bumble babe\" sauce, which is like a sweet bourbon bbq."}
{"text":"\"'This ain't your mamas sandwich\", yup that's for sure. 
Ike where have you Been all my life?!

Sub's are huge, unique fillings, fresh and delish. One sub can feed two people. 

I ordered the Bear Hug $12.31: Thin sliced steak, jalapeño poppers, jalapeño, mushrooms, bacon and dirty sauce, lettuce and tomatoes. 

Sound expensive for a sub but when you see the size of this monster you will understand.  These flavors work well together. Best sub I've  had. 

Daughter ordered Reggie Jackson $7.97.:     Ham, bacon, American, dirty sauce.  The sandwiches are toasted so they are warm and the cheese is nicely melted. 

We arrived during happy hour.... What they have happy hour?! Yes they do!

  Free, let me repeat that, Free bag of chips and drink! 

Total awesomeness!"}
{"text":"I went the other day with my friend and was so pleasantly surprised. I ordered the pilgrim with vegan cheese and gluten free bread. Holyyy crap. It was one of the best damn sandwiches I've ever had!!! Being vegan and gluten free, it's hard to find sandwiches that fit that bill. They have so many vegan options and  the gluten free bread doesn't  have eggs!!! Yay! Somehow it was still so fluffy and sooo good. The staff was also very friendly and chatted with us in a welcoming, casual manner. I like the vibe, will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Gee I think I've written like 3 separate reviews on Ike's in my life. We'll make this #4! Been to several in Nor Cal including the original Castro location. Also been to the first Az one in Mesa and now Tempe. Man can they make more in the valley to hit all sides! 

Everything is great here and I'll be making this my go to sandwich place next time I'm in Tempe. It's off the beaten path but there is a sign off of Mill so it is not too hard to find.  What do I order when I'm at a Ike's?? It's the Jaime Syrich. My personal favorite. Fried chicken sandwich. It's super good. Also the Tony soprano is really good. I don't think you can go wrong, just make sure it's in Dutch Crunch bread!!"}
{"text":"Wow!  That is all that came to my mind when I saw that Ike's had finally came to AZ!  Like a lot of reviews here I've been to the original Ike's in the Castro in SF many times.  I travel to SF several times a year and always make a point to visit Ike's.  I truly think that it is the best sandwich I've ever had.  

So big question...was this Ike's as good as the one in San Francisco??  Well, I'm glad to report that it is!  Man I'm so happy.

I was with a buddy of mine and we ended up ordering the Kryptonite,  This sandwich is no joke.  It's $26 but for two sandwiches.  I knew how big Ike's sandwiches are and I knew that I wouldn't probably even make it through one.  

The Kryptonite had everything in it.  Cheese sticks, onion rings, pesto, turkey, roast beef, ham, pastrami, bacon, stuffed jalapenos.  I mean just about everything!  It was amazing, and yes I had it on the Dutch crunch roll.

There are so many sandwiches to choose from at Ike's.  All of the favorites are there and they even offer vegan sandwiches too.  I doubt that I will get close to even trying half of the sandwiches, but I have my favorite.  The 98. Jaymee Sirewich is probably my personal favorite, but when I go back Im going to try something different.  

The best thing about Ike's here in Mesa is tables to sit and eat your sandwich!  If you have ever been to the original location you would appreciate how good that is!  Also, they are opening a location on Mill ave in Tempe!  I hope they end up expanding to all sides of the valley, especially the NW valley!

Lastly, we ordered during happy hour.  No booze here, but we did get a free chips and drink if you ordered it to eat at the restaurant.  It's every day from 4-7 so check it out!!!!

Do yourself a favor, go try Ike's.  Just be warned that it just takes one time and you will be hooked!!"}
{"text":"A lot of sandwich to choose. They taste pretty good. A bit too much on the sauce they use but still tasty."}
{"text":"LOVE the vegetarian options!! It can be difficult to find interesting veggie sandwiches, but these guys really do have something for everyone. Delicious food & friendly staff. Would stay away from adding fries to your sandwich & just get a side of fries (much better value)."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches, stuffed myself so much my stomach hurts. Really loved the spiffy tiffy. They also let you know when there is a happy hour, I think you get a free drink during that time, we just missed it :) the place is clean and the food is good."}
{"text":"One of the best sandwiches on mill avenue.. They have all vegan meats .. And it's definitely a super good lunch"}
{"text":"So...... probably best munchie pleasing sandwich I have ever had. I am native to the valley and moved away for a few years to Washington and had an amazing sandwich spot that did something similar to what they do. Out of the ordinary delicious sandwiches. Today I had the pure pleasure of becoming one with the Silsbee Super Fire! It was recommended by the guy working the register. He also suggested to sub in the fried chicken and bacon for the other meats. I Wish I would of got his name so I could say thank you and give this man a raise! I guess I will have to come back as much as possible to thank you in person. 

Sincerely the Sandwich Slayer"}
{"text":"I recently decided to check this place out for a Sunday bite after seeing all of the other fantastic Yelp reviews. Upon first entering its a little overwhelming with the number of sandwich combinations but I loved the chill and fun vibes.

I opted for the Lynda Carter sandwich but decided to add tomatoes and switch the French dressing out for dirty sauce. I figure anything called dirty sauce had to taste good.

The sandwich overall was delicious. I loved the crunch of the eggplant and of course I was right with the dirty sauce being absolutely magical. The serving size is huge too. I wasn't even able to eat the whole thing. Now I just wish I had one of these near me!"}
{"text":"Delicious Vegan Sandwiches. Had the Handsome Owl and the Mobile Momma. We loved it! Only wish their bacon was Vegan!"}
{"text":"My sandwich tasted fine but I was expecting a decent sized portion for $14 but my sandwich was all bread. I've seen Ike's do a much better job when my roommate went, so maybe I was just unlucky."}
{"text":"I was looking for something different for lunch and stumbled upon this place, hidden away a little off Mill Ave. Make a plan to go here.

Huge selection of sandwiches that can cater to anyone whether carnivore or vegetarian. The sauces are original and interesting and the house bread for the sandwiches was soft with a nice crunchy crust. Small dining area so may need to eat your sandwich somewhere else.

Only downside was they messed up the order a little and i think there should have  been more meat on my sandwich. Had the Madison Bumgarner and i thought it was a little skimpy for an $11 sandwich. Would definitely try again."}
{"text":"Sandwich perfection! Enjoy a little slice of San Francisco at Ike's. With so many options, chances are you'll be able to find something pleasing to your palate.

The first time I came here, I browsed through the vegetarian menu before the employee recommended his favorite, the Captain Kirk (An item from their San Francisco menu, but they will make any SF item for you that they don't have in the Mesa menu). It was heavenly. The bread was the right amount of chewiness and crispness, paired with the perfectly crispy breaded faux chicken, cool avocado, orange glaze, and lightly spicy pepper jack cheese. The crispy lettuce and tomato that came with it also added some texture and temperature difference to complete the loveliness of the sandwich. 

While other sandwiches I've had here have been good (The Pilgrim, Handsome Owl), the Captain Kirk is still the best one I've had. That isn't saying too much though, since there are quite a few other menu items to go through before I proclaim one sandwich my #1 pick!

Service has always been cheerful and friendly, and with a new location opening up in Tempe soon, it will be tempting to go there all the time for my sandwich fix!"}
{"text":"I used to frequent Ike's weekly. I order the same thing - the lunch special - half sandwich ( BBonds ) I believe. I always ask for Cheddar instead of Swiss and get it; except yesterday. I was told by the clerk that Ike himself said NO cheese substitutions on the half sandwiches.....really?
You lost a sale and a regular customer."}
{"text":"Definitely a solid 4 stars for the food and 5 stars for service. 

We went in for a (very) late dinner and were instantly greeted by a dauntingly expansive menu and extra-helpful staff. 

I was wearing a shirt from the Vegan Food Fest and the employee immediately asked me if I had dietary restrictions. I love when restaurants have lots of vegetarian/vegan options available! 

I ended up getting the Sometimes I'm a Vegetarian (artichokes, grilled mushroom, pesto, provolone) on the Dutch crunch bread. Sandwich was very good and I loved the texture of the bread! If there had been a better ratio between the veggies and sauce, I would've given it 5 stars. There was scant pesto, but a lot of of mayo/sauce/something mayo-based. I'm not a mayo fan (I think they call it \"dirty sauce\") and there was WAY too much of it. My boyfriend got the Jeremy Stoppleman (breaded eggplant, grilled tomato, habanero salsa, pesto, provolone). He gave his four stars as well. His complaints were too much mayo and not enough toppings. Next time we'll be sure to ask for no sauce. :) 

Our sandwiches also came with caramel apple suckers (which were actually delicious, haha). 

Overall, the service was outstanding and the food was good. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Yo straight up shits a dime boi, tastes great, atmosphere is great, and they got bathrooms son. Don't be afraid to try something new and don't complain about the price. The Sammie's are large enough that Steven Tyler can't even swallow it in one go... Validation that this place can't be beat."}
{"text":"Ike's is amazing! Even though they have TONS of different sandwich combinations, I usually go with either the Reggie Jackson or Tony Soprano on Dutch Crunch bread. The sandwiches are huge and will fill you up. The sitting area is unique and has a cool vibe.

I can't say enough good things about Ike's!"}
{"text":"Sandwiches are very filling, fresh and flavorful. Lots of subs to choose from and the employees here are very friendly. The only problem I have is the price. Just seems too pricey for a sandwich. I'll still go back, but the price makes my visit less frequent."}
{"text":"Great flavor, soooo many (almost too many) options & variations of sandwiches that it can be overwhelming, BUT definitely a must try/have."}
{"text":"Ike's is hands down my favorite sandwich shop near ASU. It's definitely a splurge for a college student, but well worth it. My go-to sandwiches are the Jeremy Stoppleman and Pat Tillman, but you can't go wrong with any choice. I could probably eat just the Dutch crunch bread toasted with dirty sauce every day if I could. 

Fast, personable, and friendly service."}
{"text":"This place is amazing for vegans and omni's! So many different options and it's always consistent and delicious when we go! They have a huge menu and are so awesome about customizing things, customer service is always amazing as well."}
{"text":"We had to wait over 30 minutes for our sandwiches.  Than we were told they had to \"evacuate\" because we ordered the tuna.  The tuna was very sub par,  on a plus note the Thanksgiving sandwich was good.  Would not recommend this place unless you want to wait over 30 minutes for overly pricey sandwiches and crappy services."}
{"text":"This sandwich shop is one of the best in town. It's halal so the meat quality is fantastic and they seriously have so many different sandwich options, it's practically impossible to choose because they are all so delicious. They even have vegetarian & vegan options so it's a great place I can take my friends with specific diets. I live by the location on Mill and always eat at the one downtown on First Friday's-both locations always deliver the same delicious sandwich which is why I keep coming back. If you don't want to wait in line for your sandwich you can always order in advance on Yelp, which is what I do because parking on Mill is terrible. Ordering in advance gives me the ability to only spend a dime on parking to quickly get my sandwich."}
{"text":"Same thing happened again with the help in this place.  Overworked and probably underpaid.  Two registers but one person working taking orders and the other register is empty without a person working this area."}
{"text":"I love Ike's Love & Sandwiches.  If you live in Mesa, this is probably one of the best kept secrets of the area.  The menu is overwhelming but I have yet to have a bad sandwich here.  The lines can be long, but the dutch crunch bread is worth it."}
{"text":"This sandwich shop is legit. I ordered the Cain and it did not disappoint. I did modify it a bit and I think they may have not taken heed to my removal of the sauce that came with the sandwich as opposed to my request for Italian. I thought I would hate it since I do not like horse radish but I was corrected. The menu can be overwhelming but take your time you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I would defiantly go here again. Service was great the girl working the counter was helpful and happy, she showed that she truly loved working there. We tried 4 different sandwiches all were tasty. The house \"dirty sauce\" was an aioli sauce that was do good."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and great people! The staff is really nice and helpful. The sandwiches are around 10 bucks which is a little pricey but worth it ! It's super tasty and a good chill atmosphere ."}
{"text":"The food is great service has gone down a lot since I first started coming here, place needs updating, chips always out of stock"}
{"text":"This place is so great. They have hundreds of different sandwich options. There is something for Vegans, Vegetarians and Meat Eaters. 

The food is delicious. We've tried about six sandwiches so far. They all have great flavor. Nice portion sizes. The breads are always fresh. They have managed to make vegan and vegetarian sandwiches so great even meat eaters are ordering them. 

The staff is friendly and willing to suggest different options. They allow you to customize each sandwich so you get exactly what you want. 

The dining area is clean. The restrooms are clean and they give you a lollipop with each order. 

I highly suggest you check this place out. You can thank me later. 

Oh and free bag of chips for Yelpers upon check in."}
{"text":"Spiffy Tiffy on Dutch Crunch Bread with Dirty Sauce is a must! Delicious! This place also has excellent customer service, everyone had lots of smiles on, which truly makes a difference."}
{"text":"A wide variety of taste and flavors with a myriad of choices. Their crunch bread is awesome and the sauces really make the sandwiches. If you're looking for healthy, probably not the right sandwich spot. If you like delicious and mayo-based sauces,  you've found your spot."}
{"text":"Best sandwich place I have had in Arizona so far. Ordered #333 Stephan Jenkins (turkey, cheese, pesto) on whole wheat. Also got a side of fries because I didn't expect the sandwich to be humongous. 

I could not fit my mouth around it... I almost regretted getting the fries. Nonetheless, it was very delicious and I am going to come back soon and try new things."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwich, fast & friendly service, and free caramel apple lollipops!!! I am most definitely a fan. The location is nice and clean, and located just close enough to the freeway."}
{"text":"So delicious--great Bay Area food choice right here in the valley of the sun! Love that there's something for the omnivores and veg's in the group. I always know we'll leave full and happy here :)

They definitely need to go to a FedEx Office and update their signage though..the handmade taped signs in the windows are crazy  

Delicious Food!"}
{"text":"Vegetarian paradise! So many choices. So delicious! I love this place and will certainly return. It's a new favorite :)"}
{"text":"I first had an Ike's sandwich while on vacation in San Francisco after seeing them featured on a Food Network program. They became a must-visit when traveling to Northern California, as well as becoming my FAVORITE SANDWICH. 

When trying this location for the first time I was hoping that they were able to replicate the Ike's food and service I was familiar with. They hit it spot on! Everything from the diverse menu to the friendly service, they even replicated the flavor perfectly. Every sandwich is slathered in Ike's specialty sandwich spread dubbed \"dirty sauce\" which really makes for a unique flavor. The Dutch Crunch bread is another Ike's specialty and cannot be passed up."}
{"text":"Amazing. Wish it was closer to my house!
GET DUTCH BREAD!
The soda is from who knows what company, and they don't have the popular \"lays, doritos\" chips. But they do have really good \"Voodoo\" chips
Anyways...EAT THERE ITS SO AMAZING!
Great now i'm hungry just thinking about it lol
The only problem going there was choosing what sandwhich to get because there is such a variety.
Don't worry though your not alone. I went today for lunch and 2 other people were standing next to me looking at their huge menu.
They give you a caremel apple lolipop for dessert. YOU WILL LOVE IT
YUM YUM YUM"}
{"text":"I love this place! Radiates love.
Fantastic vegetarian/vegan/gluten free food.
I usually get a reading rainbow!
The sandwiches are HUGE they are usually 2 meals for me so I don't mind paying the price.
Staff is really friendly, helpful and pretty quick.
So nice to have a place that serves vegetrian/vegan options other than just lettuce and tomatoes (ahem JJ's!)"}
{"text":"This is a must visit spot! So glad these guys finally got so sense into them and came to Mill Ave! ;) Amazing food, personable friendly service. \"Ike's for the love of sandwiches\"... What is there not to love!? They also have great Veggie/Vegan options if you're into that sorta thing. Thank you, Marco, Patrick and staff for the great experience! I had \"The love triangle\" Veggie chicken, honey mustard, BBQ, pepper jack, Swiss, cheddar + avocado, grilled onions, and jalapeño on Dutch crunch. W/SD hot sauce. ~Mmmmm :)"}
{"text":"I am a vegetarian, so I have typically never been a big sandwich eater mainly because of options that are offered at sandwich shops. Usually, I have a choice between cheese, lettuce, black olives, peppers and tomatoes. Pretty boring.
Ike's is awesome! It has a huge selection for vegetarian and vegan, with a variety of combinations. I had the Dream of Jeannie which was like a BLT, but with veggie bacon. The sauce was spicy, which made the sandwich yummy. The prices are a bit high, but the sandwiches are so big, I took half home to eat for another meal. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Ike's is the perfect place to go to pick up a quick sandwich!  My wait time has always been very short and the sandwiches are absolutely delicious.  I'm a vegan and I love that many of the sandwiches can be veganized.  Pirates of the Caribbean and vegan Ponch and John are the best.  I have always received great service and fresh food even when they are busy.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Awesome sandwich shop. Unique menu, tons of options. Be sure to dine in between 3-7 PM for happy hour, free chips and a drink."}
{"text":"Really great sandwiches! 
The menu is huge!  A tad overwhelming, I would say look at the menu online first. But be prepared for a tasty treat."}
{"text":"I love food. I really love sandwiches. I  have lived in some great places with exceptional food and I  can honestly say that the Pilgrim might just be the best sandwich I've ever eaten. That's a pretty bold claim to make considering I've eaten at some legendary sandwich institutions throughout the U.S. But I feel comfortable saying it.

It's that friggin good."}
{"text":"yooooooo ike's is the joint. First off, Cheerwine (which can be found there) is slappin. Why isn't that more common? Gimme dem fizzy lifting drinks

second off, choices on choices on choices on choices. I don't think there is a genuine sandwich that is not on that menu. 

third off, madison bumgarner. rib eye, yellow bbq, habanero salsa, pepper jack. yas yas yas, trick

fourth off, that dutch crunch bread makes all other breads look like absolute lames. how do these guys make bread so good? 

fifth off, the vibes. awesome celeb pics on the wall. who doesn't like celeb pics?

Jay Pritchard from Modern Family (pic on wall) approves of this place and so do i. 

FIVE STARS"}
{"text":"The only thing I didn't love about this place is that they closed while we were chillin. :P The #2 Hollywould's SF cheesteak or whatever it was called was phenomenal. Their famous \"crunch bread\" was incredible. I wish I lived nearby, I'd eat here all the time."}
{"text":"Some of the best sandwiches you can get in Phoenix. Soo many diverse flavors between two pieces of bread."}
{"text":"My first taste of Ike's was at a different location, but doesnt matter which one it is, it's all good. Literally, its all good, can't go wrong with a single choice thats on the menu. Every option is very unique and the portions are large enough for 2 meals. if you go during happy hour you get free chips and drink if you eat in. Other wise dont both buying the chips or drink. The seemed generic and the drinks were RC cola options. Don't let sub-par chips ruin the Ike's experience."}
{"text":"$12 after tax and tip. The sandwich was really tasty and the Dutch bread was outstanding - both crispy and chewy - but I had a sour taste in my Christhole after spending so much for a sandwich."}
{"text":"ok. so they are doing somethings right i guess. they are friendly, the place is clean. they have a pretty creative, extensive menu. that said i wasn't impressed enough to ever go back. i went there because i was walking my dog and wanted to stop for lunch they had outdoor seating so i thought i'd give it a shot. they are very chintsy (if that's even a word lol) with their dressings. my sandwich was mostly bread. i had the Count of Monte Chase-O sandwich which features ham, turkey, swiss cheese and strawberry preserves. unique huh? you couldn't tell, like i said, i tasted only the bread. if they would be even a little more generous with the lettuce, onions, meats and condiments. i like a sandwich that is as much on my face as it is in my mouth. this wasn't it. nothing fell out of this sandwich!"}
{"text":"Friend and I came last week for sandwiches to be told that they didn't receive they're shipment and had no food to serve. Came back today and when I ordered I was told they're out of tomatoes. They're also out of straws. And after waiting for 10 minutes for my sandwich was also told that they're ALSO out of chicken... might want to rethink their suppliers and hire more to speed up their service!!"}
{"text":"Sandwiches are my favorite food. Why? Because there are so many possibilities! This place really takes that idea and runs with it.

I arrived here with my family behind a group of about 10. I had read that it takes a long time to get your food here, and I was concerned that with that many people ahead of us, it would be an overly long wait. It actually worked in our favor, because it being our first time, we spend the entire time we were in line staring, gobsmacked, at the wall of options.

I appreciated the friendliness of the employees and their patience as they walked me through half a dozen questions to order my sandwich.

I went with the Dutch crunch, since everyone seems to rave about it. I liked that it kind of reminded me of a giraffe pattern, but I didn't really get the appeal. It was hard, and I ended up peeling half of it away. The halal chicken with a combination of sauces and cheese and onions and jalapeños was still yummy, minus half the bread.

The great thing is, there are still about 100 more sandwiches to try, so even though I didn't find THE ONE this time, I can try again on another day."}
{"text":"very excited to find this place. A ton of options, I had to ask the cashier his favorite. He was helpful and mentioned two. One on the menu and one off. I went with the Paul Rueben. It was awesome. A ton of food. I would give this place 5 stars if the price was not so high. Little room to sit inside, but very casual and friendly."}
{"text":"The menu is really puzzling with toooo many sandwiches of all combinations of meat, cheese and veges. I Had the Hollywood Cheesesteak sandwich in whole Wheat bread. Was really delicious.
They also have a good vegan menu
I only wished their fries have been as good as the sandwiches."}
{"text":"Wow! The sandwiches at Ike's are amazing. When I heard about this place, I was intrigued. When I found out they had vegan cheese (hooray for the lactose intolerant crowd!), I was even more excited to try it. 

Walking in, it's a little overwhelming. The menu board has tons of options and that isn't all of the possibilities. 

The biggest complaint I hear about this place is the price. But the sandwiches are so delicious - you get what you pay for. Or go during Happy Hour. You get chips and a drink for free when you eat at the restaurant.

Honestly, one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. I cannot recommend this place enough. Got a food allergy? No problem. You're going to leave this place stuffed and happy."}
{"text":"They are great.  Awesome service and food is amazing too.   Can't go wrong with nothing. Something for vegan and carnivore alike"}
{"text":"The best sub place in tempe!! You wont be let down with a selection of 40+ subs. Voodoo chip are muy fuego."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum yum. Holy crap. Yum. Amazing choices! I had something with thin sliced rib eye, provolone, steak sauce, onion rings, and their crazy good garlic aioli. The menu is epic. The dude who took my order was friendly and fun. Dutch crunch bread to die for. Sandwiches were gigantic! I'm hooked."}
{"text":"Been pretty busy lately so when a friend hit me up to go for sandwiches I took the 10 min drive from Tempe to Ike's in Mesa

A sandwich shop with NorCal Dutch Crunch - OH BABY 
Sandwiches are pretty pricey but just having that elusive Dutch Crunch bread makes this sandwich worth it. Having the option to create anything you want here is an added plus. I don't remember what I ordered but it came with mozzarella sticks and roast beef and I was pleased.

Sorta sad after talking with the staff that they were supposed to have a location on Mill but it fell through :'( I guess the fine people of Mesa can enjoy this sandwich shop while we settle for the like's of Jimmy John's

Now I can finally say my favorite line from Super Smash Brother's Brawl ~ We Like Ike ('s)

*Edit looks like they are having a location on Mill after all~ Yay!"}
{"text":"Was excited about a sandwich place with lots of vegan options. Big disappointment. Bread and ingredients are worse than subway quality. There ARE tons of veggie options available, but I'm not optimistic after this one."}
{"text":"I know it's gonna be a great place when I'm waiting in line and enjoy one of the best playlists just bringing back memories. The atmosphere was just completely chilled out and happy. 

I ordered a Adam Richman sandwich and was overjoyed with flavor. Who knew the mixture of honey and pesto would make me elated to be eating there. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place is so good! The meatless mike is off the chain. Make sure you get the XXX rabbit"}
{"text":"probably my new favorite sandwich resturant, I tried one sandwich only so far. Lol 
Try it out, menu also have halal meat!"}
{"text":"First of all, idk how I didn't know about this place until now, the sandwiches are AMAZING! I absolutely enjoy the food here and not to mention getting full of eating only half of a sandwich and always take the other half and eat it later. The dirty mayo based sauce they have on their sandwiches is so good I even ask them to give me some in a little container to add to the sandwiches I make at home, the staff are nice and friendly and good service :) and all chicken is halal which is a plus ;)"}
{"text":"Best sandwhich place I have been to in a long time!! Everything is always fresh and their menu is unbeatable. The best part is they have vegetarian sandwhich options. I suggest the Jessica rabbit sandwhich and the meatless mike. Tried a new pesto sandwhich today!!"}
{"text":"Hate to have to update my review like this, but the past TWO times I've eaten here, I've gotten violently ill immediately afterwards. Ikes hates me!"}
{"text":"We have been coming to this location for almost 2 years now and honestly only come back because 7/10 times the sandwiches are amazing and we really appreciate the vegan and vegetarian options.

Today we ordered 2 sandwiches to go, called around 4:25pm and the gal that took our order said it would be ready at 4:45pm, which is usually how long it's takes for 2 sandwiches. Except, we get there at 4:45pm and they hadn't even started making our sandwiches... this is maybe the 9th or 10th time this has happened and one of the main reasons my fiancé and I stopped eating Ike's so much. 

We have both worked in restaurants so he tend to let some things slide...(like last week when we tried to order sandwiches for pick up and were put on hold for 12 minutes, but not really on hold, the team member who answered the phone just set the phone down and forgot... so we heard her take some orders, shuffle around, change the music and gossip a bit before we hung up) But after this many times of calling in orders, waiting 20-30 minutes and then waiting another 10-15 when we get to the shop while they make the sandwiches is now just annoying. 

We probably won't come to Ikes as much as we would like and when we do I guess we just won't have our expectations as high as they used to be."}
{"text":"I always love a place where the employees look like they're having a good time, and Ike's had it! Rachel was the best - not only really enthusiastic and attentive, but also a lot of fun.

We got the Bear Hug and the Spiffy Tiffy . Both were fantastic and the dutch crumble bread tasted like a buttery biscuit. All the ingredients tasted fresh and high-quality, especially the pesto. Large portions, though, so we got a dinner out of it, too.

A little pricey, but definitely worth it, especially because we happened to get there during happy hour (4pm-7pm, I think) so we got a free drink and chips. They also give a caramel apple pop with the sandwich.

Can't wait for the new location opening soon on Mill Ave!"}
{"text":"I really need to try some other sandwiches that they offer but the Paul Reuben's is insanely good!!! Gotta have it on the Dutch Crunch bread."}
{"text":"I love the friendly staff here and the caramel apple lollipop bonus. :) Sometimes I'm a Vegetarian is my favorite sandwich!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend saved me half of a Reggie Jackson sub from here...best 1/2 of a sandwich ever! Other good sub places in the area to try out if you're a sub junkie are Firehouse, Jersey Mike's (closer to the town lake and freeway), and Jimmy John's which is right next to student housing at ASU."}
{"text":"Huge selection something for everyone. Honestly best sandwich I have ever had. Slightly expensive but worth
It!!"}
{"text":"Have visited this place 3 times so far.   Tried different sandwiches each time.  First time was the best but the other times the sandwiches were pretty bland.  Service has always been good."}
{"text":"I would go out of my way to find one of these! I first tried it in LA and practically chatted when I saw that they were in Phoenix, too (Tucson next, please!). They have high quality GF bread for my husband and the best sandwich bread ever for the rest of us. Don't fear the dirty sauce; you'll want to buy a bucket of it once you try it, but sadly, it's not for sale. The Tony Soprano is my favorite sandwich, but every choice my family has made has been tasty."}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink):
1 star:  Never again.
2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back.
3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.
4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

Dutch crunch bread!  Zapp's potato chips!  These two things alone keep this place at 4 stars.  I just can't give it a 5 despite these because I've had other, better, amazing sandwiches, but these are pretty darn good.

I do't care that the Dutch crunch kind of falls apart and roughs up the roof of your mouth, I love the texture.  So, so many sandwiches to choose from.  Good because I love variety.  Bad because it leads to consumer choice freeze - too many options, don't know what to do.  It's easily overcome.

I've had the Tony Soprano (ham, salami, turkey, provolone, Italian dressing).  It's fine, I could do without the turkey.  It's not a great Italian sub, but it's still a tasty sandwich.  Also had the Lizzy's Lips (halal chicken, pepper jack, Italian dressing).  This was an interesting combination and it, too, was mighty tasty.  Little kick from the pepper jack, little tart saltiness from the dressing, with decently cooked, not-too-dry chicken.  It's a \"healthier\" option I suppose.

Interestingly enough, this is the only Valley location I've been to even though there's one closer to home.  And I'll try it, assuming I will like it, because again.  Dutch Crunch.  Zapp's potato chips."}
{"text":"More vegetarian and vegan options than you will find at most any other sandwich shop. Ike's is a chain of higher end deli sandwich shops that prides itself on using fresh, fine ingredients. This location is conveniently placed in downtown Tempe, steps from many bars and hotels. I placed an order for pickup, and the order was packed and ready to go when I arrived. I claimed my free bag of chips (they have Zapp's which are awesome!) with Yelp check in, and walked back to my hotel.

I got the vegan Pilgrim, which was delicious. I recommend their signature Dutch crunch bread, which is a fantastic freshly baked crusty sourdough. The flavorful combination of thinly sliced vegan turkey, sweet cranberry sauce, and a spicy kick of Sriracha were balanced perfectly by fresh lettuce and tomato. The only downside was that the fillings were skimpy, especially at $10/sandwich-the bread and lettuce to other fillings ratio was way off. My boyfriend got the Damon Bruce and did not enjoy it, for the same reason. They also did not include the extra pickles and mustard that we requested. Regardless, I still recommend Ike's and appreciate their multitude of vegan options."}
{"text":"I ordered by phone ahead of time because I get a half hour lunch break. The person who took my order was fast, friendly, and knowledgeable. When I arrived, there was a line and I had to stand in it to pay for my sandwich which cost over $11. The line did not move fast and I felt frustrated that there were so few staff members to man the registers and take the orders during lunch rush. I was 15 minutes late coming back to work and was forced to take a 15 minute lunch the next day to make up the time. Needless to say, i won't return to Ike's for lunch during my work week. On the brighter side, the sandwich was a hefty helping and very tasty and satisfying, so it was worth the money; I just wish the service was more tailored to office folks like me."}
{"text":"We called ahead with 15 min left until close and let Jackson know we were coming. He gladly stayed open, and accommodated us, this absolutely made our night. It was a very kind gesture especially for a Friday night when you know they want to get home. Thanks for being awesome Jackson!"}
{"text":"I am no stranger to Ike's.  I have been more times than I can count, including this location when I worked on that side of town.  I ordered a \"Vegan Handsome Owl\" and when I got it the sandwich wasn't very big, or at least not as big as it usually is. I also noticed it had pretty much none of the teriyaki sauce on it, in my opinion that's what makes that sandwich.  It was also pretty cold, it's not necessarily meant to be a \"hot\" sandwich but the vegan chicken was not even warm let alone hot which made it seem undercooked and chewy so it was all I could taste, it ended up making me lose my appetite half way through and I ended up throwing away the other half because my stomach felt upset.  I noticed the sandwich had been done for about 5 min but the customer at the register kept having a conversation with the cashier so she didn't hear him say \"order up\". All in all the experience was pretty disappointing especially when you spend $12 on a sandwich."}
{"text":"I'm from San Francisco and was lucky enough to have my first Ike's sandwich at its very first location. Ike's has never disappointed. For a vegetarian/vegan, the selection of sandwiches are amazing. I love that they are able to have mock meat on their menu - though I'm not certain that they make their own mock meat. I have had multiple sandwiches on their menu, but the meatball sub is always my go to.

This particular location has an interesting set up w/ friendly and efficient staff. It's very warehousey - the tables most often need a good sweep/wipe down before we sit down to eat. I've never had to wait more than 7-8 minutes for my order. The last time we visited, we had the turkey/cranberry sandwich and the tots. Sandwich was ace as always, but we only got 6-7 tots...I was thinking that it would be a lot more considering they give a lot more fries in previous visits. 

They also forgot to give me my caramel pop - they always forget my caramel pop...even when they ask if I want it and put it on the order..."}
{"text":"First time coming here from out of town, and it was a slightly disappointing experience. The guy at the counter was very friendly and helpful. After taking forever to finally decide what I wanted, I finally had my heart set on something, I just had a few modifications (no mushroom, add cucumber and mozz sticks). Guy at counter immediately went off trying to think of a different way he could ring it in so it would cost less, which I did appreciate, and it seemed like a great idea until I got back to my hotel. The sandwich he rang in had havarti cheese (which i do not like) instead of the Swiss that came with the sandwich I had ordered. Other toppings were also missing, like avocado (a main reason I ordered that sandwich), and the cucumber. It still tasted fine once I plucked all the cheese off, but it sucks to drop $30 on two sandwiches and not even get what I ordered. At that point I would rather pay the extra couple if bucks to get the right thing."}
{"text":"Heard of this place from my cousin in LA so we had to check it out!  I got the Reggie Jackson and added onion and avocado .. Amazing!! Also got the fried zucchini and seasoned fries - everything was delicious and the portions were huge! Great service and food was superb! Mouth watering sandwiches - so filling and satisfying!"}
{"text":"Um my favorite sandwich shop EVER!! Staff is so friendly and the food is so so so so delicious!!! It's the perfect place to make your own, and theyve got so many things you can put on a sandwich... Just when you think you've come up with an original idea, guess again... there's probably a name for the sandwich you just came up with! I also love that they'll do most of the other sandwiches from different Ike's locations. Try them all!! My favorite is Jake the Snake or Menage-a-trois! Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"We tried Ike's for the first time yesterday. The menu is kind of overwhelming for first-time visitors, but once we looked it over, we were able to find something we liked. I had the Bear Hug on Dutch Crunch bread. 

I liked the \"Happy Hour\" special where you get free chips and a drink from 4-7.

It's kind of hidden in a shopping center near Fiesta Mall, where some of the businesses have closed. We'll definitely go back if we're in the area."}
{"text":"This place is worth the drive if you're not that close to the Fiesta Mall area. Just had the Bear Hug and it was amazing. Jalepeno poppers on a sandwhich might sound weird but it just works the way they do it.. so good. Kind of a lot of bread but the sourdough is as good as any I've had. The whole sandwhich is huge, could prob split with somone. I'll definitely be going back, and I've already FB'd it. :)"}
{"text":"Was a little scared goin in... hard to choose from 900+ sandwiches and they're all VERY unique. I went with #2 hollywould's SF cheesesteak... man it is huge! Costs about  $10 but its worth it! Could probably feed 2... very flavorful! Not sure what that sauce is but it is good! Definitely gotta try a few more..."}
{"text":"Barry Bond and KC BBQ sandwiches were delicious.  Kiddo really enjoyed Chester the Cheetah sandwich as well.  Beer battered onion rings were phenom.  We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Ike's is great!  They have hundreds of sandwiches available!  My favorite is the Adam Richman.  Another good combo is the Mozzarella Big Cheese with avocado!  The dutch crunch bread is wonderful!  

Happy Hour is a bonus (free chips and drinks)!  The staff is always friendly!  It is a little pricier than other sandwich places, but they are a pretty good sized portion."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a little over a year now and I must say that the vegetarian sandwiches are pretty good I'm super stuck on the sometimes I'm a vegetarian sandwich  this is the place to come if you looking for great sandwiches"}
{"text":"First time here. Seveal employees standing around chatting which  makes my review even worse, place was empty. Sandwiches are expensive, and so I expected something better than what was received. Ordered the Barry B. Not worth $8. Also ordered side of fried zucchini and fried onion rings. The amount we got, great..but...zucchini was not cooked. I had wet beer batter with every bite. I returned them and employee agreed upon visual of it. Also, as honey mustard cup was placed on my tray as a side, a hair was very obvious inside the sauce. I returned that within seconds of getting it handed to me. Goodness. They offered to replace zucchini, i declined. Tried jalapeño poppers instead...they arrived cut on half and a very small serving of 4. They forgot my dipping sauce, my third trip to the counter. Probably not coming back. Shame, i came here after reading reviews :("}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ordered through Door Dash.  I had the Pat Tillman with tater tots added to the actual sandwich.  I had the dutch crunch bread which is really tasty.  We also ordered a few sides beer battered onion rings and stuffed jalapeño poppers. I really like the onion rings, they had a nice beer flavor, even being a little soggy. The poppers were ok nothing really stood out about them. I will be back to explore more of their delicious combinations on their fresh dutch crunch bread.  I am a fan!!"}
{"text":"Not sure I have ever been a fan of a place as fast as I became a fan of Ike's Place.

They opened their first location in AZ and after hearing a lot of hype, decided to check it out. The menu is a bit intimidating at first, but I eventually settled on the Bella.

The staff here was extremely friendly and the vibe of the restaurant has that neighborhood sandwich place kind of feel. It was not very busy and had little wait for our food. Oh and there were some cops eating there too, so that tells you the food is good right there.

Once I tried the first bite of that sandwich, after taking pictures of it for Yelp of course, I was immediately a fan. Everything about this sandwich was great, the bread, the meat, the toppings, couldn't think of a single complaint about it. It even came with a lollipop!! Everyone I was with was saying the same thing about their orders as well. In fact, it was so goodI actually ordered a sandwich \"To Go\" to eat later. 

I can't wait for the next time I find myself at Ike's and have told everyone I have come into contact with since my last visit about it. 

Maybe I should buy me some Ike's Place schwag!!"}
{"text":"Nice location and very clean. Staff was very friendly and efficient. I had a hard time deciding what I wanted so after much deliberation, I decided I was going to order the Matt Cain which comes with roast beef, turkey, salami, godfather sauce and provolone. It was tasty. I could've gone without the the Godfather sauce though. Bread was great.

If you check-in you get a free bag of Zapp's chips. The Hotter n' Hot Jalapeño flavor is very good. I want to come back and try the Damon Bruce and Michael Jordan."}
{"text":"This is not your typical sandwich joint.  These sandwiches are in a league of their own.  I ate the Matt Cain and it was fantastic!!! I really loved the bread they recommended."}
{"text":"I have decided to write this review because it is too good....to be....one of those guys on the menu; if you're sports fan that is.So a little interesting sandwich shop located on the backside of the building.  We were wondering around until we see the sign...which is still rather small and rear and you'd probably miss it.  
Food=    Good taste
Wait=     Not too good, it's too long, but the wait is worth it!!
Price=    Tricky due to it ain't cheap to begin, and yet, you don't think twice cause it's just too   good to have.  
The sandwich is one of those NYers style where the ingredient is all there; nothing like the subways.  The kitchen is very transparent as you see the whole process from the side of the restaurant.  The menu can be confusing as you just have to go through one by one to know what the heck you're getting yourself into...a treat, or a hella good treat that is...

Onion ring is pretty weird...good taste for the first few bites then it gets kinda saggy and not interesting.  But definitely not the one they serve from fastfood chains.  Final verdict....get yourself extra cash, because good food sometimes ain't cheap, and get some different ones to try it out with Ike's."}
{"text":"the wall of pictures and crazy amount of items to choose from, thought this was going to be an amazing experience. However, once i got my sandwich about to bite into the sandwich and there was a  beard hair right on the edge!  ruined it for my appetite. The guys asked me if they could make another one. And super nice about it! Still i will never go back!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Ike's! I'm from the Bay Area, where he first started out, and left for a couple years.  I was extremely surprised and excited when I found out that he had one here in my new home!! Yasss!!!"}
{"text":"The service is great, the food is good. A little rich for an everyday lunch, but satisfying nonetheless."}
{"text":"There is nothing in the world like the combo of bread amazingness, the way the chicken is sort of shredded or whatever- it's fabulous- and that sauce. Once I think, \"I'm gonna get Ike's\" it's all I can think about until glorious first bite."}
{"text":"I ordered the usual #111 menage a trois however my to-go order didn't come with a caramel apple pop, paper bag or napkins. The server however nice seemed confused. The sandwich usually you could taste the honey but it felt like it was missing the usual bbq sauce.

 Maybe this was an off day but for a $10 sandwich I better get my candy. We did come during happy hour 2-5 pm and they give you a free large size drink."}
{"text":"Maybe I visited on an off night? My Dutch Crunch bread had the right texture, maybe a little flat but nothing to complain about. The taste however...unsalted slightly stale plain crackers. I had the Bella because of some good reviews, but the chicken was a texture less tasteless pile of mush. Well it did have one taste. That kind of gamey chicken taste - just a touch. I probably wouldn't have noticed it if the sandwich had had *any* other flavor to it. Ate half - threw the other half. Just wasn't worth eating. 

I also had the onion rings. Breading was fine, but again not much flavor and no salt. They were also slightly burnt (black spots) on the outside.

Normally with a food review like that I'd give 2 stars (I reserve 1 star for food poisoning), but the place was clean, I like the format, the menu is impressive, and I'll probably try it again since all these reviews can't be wrong...can they??"}
{"text":"This place might be great for people with dietary concerns but I'm not thrilled that I paid $10 for a sandwich that was mostly bread and lettuce.  I ordered the Matt Cain, which has turkey, roast beef, and salami.  3 kinds of meat so I'm thinking it's going to be loaded.  I was wrong.  Not only that but it was pretty sloppy, meaning the meat tended to squish out of the opposite end that I was biting into.  

I'm not deducting points for this but I believe I noticed another reviewer point out that Ike's is a \"local establishment\".  Sorry to burst your bubble but this place is a chain from the Bay Area in case the names of the menu items had not tipped you off."}
{"text":"I don't understand all the 5 star reviews. 
This place has a huge menu and prices that match.
After making a choice I waited and waited and waited for someone to take my order which I could have understood if I wasn't the only person in the joint. 
I then waited and waited and waited for my to go order while all of the staff was in the back. I finally got my meal, made my way home and bit into a Sandwhich was that over dressed and falling apart. 
The flavors were ok but a Sandwhich that messy with all of the other issues I had means I won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Creative sandwiches and great service.  Loved the vegetarian selections Great alternative to th standard sub shop"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Ike's a few times. They have lots of different sandwiches including some vegetarian options that are very good. I've had the pirates of the Caribbean, sometimes I'm a vegetarian (the pesto is delicious) and I think it was called the little mermaid or something like that (it was just shredded chicken, orange glaze and cheese). The vegetarian ones were better. The sandwiches are a bit pricey. Be prepared to spend more than $8 for your sandwich. I'd suggest going there during happy hour so you get your drink and chips free if you want those.   I'd go more often if it was cheaper but it's close to campus and they have Zapps chips. The employees are also really friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Hey guys. Today was my 3rd time in the shop. I'm really bummed out. Every visit, I've ordered the Barry B. with avocado. \"We call it the 786..it's just the Barry B. with avocado. It saves you a couple cents\" is what you all say. I appreciate you looking out for me, except for the fact that I've received avocado on my sando 0/3x. I used to work at Bunk sandwiches in Oregon; I know what it's like to work at a sandwich shop, so regardless of service, I tip $2.00 per sandwich..so c'mon. For the love of god, please put avocado on my fkn sandwich because I'm paying for it :( :( :(   you're killing me.

Other than that, this place is decent. Pricey, but understandable for a gourmet sandwich joint.

Ike's NO love and sandwiches :("}
{"text":"Great shop and friendly staff. But it's the food that makes this place great. Good variety. What a sandwich! It wasn't just a sandwich but more of a gourmet meal. My wife and I looked at each other with wide eyed glee after our first bites. Incredible freshness and flavor. Definitely worth many visits."}
{"text":"Bomb sandwich shop! Employees are all freaking awesome and always checked up on us! Food tastes great and wasn't to expensive. Defiantly going to be coming back"}
{"text":"I sat on this review overnight, and the more I think about it, the more I am bummed out about my visit last night.  

I had heard mostly good things of this place, and had wanted to try it out for quite some time. The main draw was the Dutch crunch bread.  You never see that type of bread outside of Northern CA for the most part.  My buddy Sean has a joint up in South San Francisco (Darby Dan's) that he took me to a couple of times, and I fell in love with the Dutch crunch bread.  Not sure why its not used more often!  Anyways.... My friends from Northern CA always hyped Ike's and you would swear that it was the greatest sandwich of all time.  Um, about that........

I drove down to Tempe (Was going to a concert at Yucca Tap Room later that night) and decided to stop into Ike's.  I was kind of unfamiliar with the area, so I drove around the block once and finally found parking (underground garage, $1.00 for each 20 minutes).  I walked upstairs from the garage and the entrance to Ike's was right there.  I walked in and right away, I noticed a familiar face.  It was Ike himself!  He was chatting it up with a guy for a good 5 minutes.  

I stood there and looked at the menu for a bit.  It's a tad overwhelming!  The cashier was friendly enough and pointed me to a list on the wall of their \"Top 10 sandwiches\".  My buddy had told me to get the Menage a Trois (Halal bbq chicken type sandwich), but I wasn't in the mood for shredded chicken.  I finally decided on the \"Pat Tillman\" on Dutch crunch bread.  I placed my order, got a cup for water, and sat down.  It took awhile for my sandwich to come out.  Once it did arrive, here is how it was...............

The Pat Tillman-  This sandwich consisted of roast beef, sauteed mushrooms and mozzarella sticks.  Sounded pretty damn good, and I figured that for my first time here, go with an Arizona original (RIP Pat Tillman!).  I added lettuce and tomato to the sandwich but skipped any kind of \"sauce\" (I had seen pictures of their sandwiches and they are drenched in sauce...I knew I wouldn't like it with that much goop on it, so I got it without).  I unwrapped my sandwich and the first thing I noticed was that it was a tad skimp.  It may have been 10 inches long, but it was not \"fat\".  For $10.80 after tax, I wanted something a little bit larger.  I took a bite and it tasted alright.  The Dutch crunch bread was fantastic.  That was by far and away the best part of the sandwich!  Crispy and crunchy on top, soft in the middle.  Really great bread!  The inner guts of the sandwich were skimp though!  It had maybe 4 ounces of roast beef, 3 mozzarella sticks, and a tiny amount of mushrooms.  The lettuce and tomato filled it up a little bit, but they key ingredients were definitely lacking!  Totally not worth almost $11.00!  I wasn't even that hungry and I finished the sandwich with ease.  After I was done, I was on my way.  About that...............

One of the reasons that I was not that impressed was the lack of caring.  The cashier was friendly enough, but was still kind of monotone and not too upbeat.  Seemed like he was just going through the motions.  It also kind of turned me off that Ike didn't say anything to anybody in the place.  He was sitting at a table on his laptop doing some work, but still....he could have stood up and walked over to the 4 of us eating in the restaurant and asked how our sandwich was, or at least said hello, or thank you for coming in or \"hope to see you soon\" or whatever.  When I was done with my sandwich, I walked up to the cashier to throw away my wrapper, walked right past Ike, and made it to the door without either one of them saying anything.  I know that may seem trivial to some, and it may sound like I'm complaining over some petty shit, but it still would have made my experience way better if I felt \"valued\".  Hell...they are probably printing money at this joint, and don't have to do a damn thing to retain customers (Thank you Arizona State and young college students!), but I sure do like to go to businesses that actually care that you are there.  

I don't think I am ever coming back.  It's too far away from my house, the sandwich was decent, but not \"good\", and the price of it was way too high for what you get!  I'm glad I tried it, but even if I lived close by, I couldn't justify returning because of the price and lack of main ingredients. Not bad enough for a 1 star review, but definitely a 2 star \"Meh, I've experienced better\".  Much, much better........."}
{"text":"Very good. I tried this place for the first time today and I really enjoyed my sub. I had the Kevin Bacon with dirty sauce. My husband had the Pat Tillman. Overall, it was probably one of the best sandwiches I had ever eaten. 

Also, the service was great. And the building was clean and inviting!

Go to Ike's. You'll love it"}
{"text":"Went for my first time; blown away! Fantastic food! Very unique! The customer service was amazing. Friendly, informative and knowledgeable. Cannot wait to spread the word and go back!"}
{"text":"Jaymee sirewich on dutch crunch.  Like fried chicken??  like tasty goodness?  get this bad boy and enjoy!

Then try all their other sandwiches.  I also recommend the Menage a trois!  on dutch crunch, of course!

I actually haven't had a bad sandwich from this place yet and I've tasted at least 3 or 4 others.  This is probably one of my favorite sandwich places here in AZ right now.   First time I had them was in SF and I'm so glad they built two here!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches here are bomb, first time i had the \"MILF\", and yesterday I had the \"Barry Bumgarner\" I think that's what it was called... anyways, both of them are super bomb and pretty filling, they have a huge menu of sandwiches, but the drinks are lacking. also price is high for sandwiches, it'll cost you about $10 for a sandwich. Even though they are good, idk if they're worth $10"}
{"text":"I dragged my feet on checking this place out because I was thinking it's just a sandwich; no big deal. I was SO wrong!

I checked out their website ahead of time, which has a \"vegan\" tab for each Ike's location, so I was already familiar with some of the vegan offerings.  But when I arrived, there were so many more options jumping out a me. Luckily, the employees know their stuff when it comes to their vegan menu, and they were able to answer my questions.

I ordered the Handsome Owl (sans cheese): vegan chicken, teriyaki, Wasabi Mayo, lettuce, onions, pickles, & banana peppers, on Ike's World Famous Dutch Crunch bread. OMG! I don't know what sorcery they used to conjure up that bread's amazing and unique flavor, but it is phenomenal! The combinations of all the flavors that encompass the sandwich is ingenious.  My mind is blown. It's a $10 sandwich, but it's huge, filling, and worth every single penny.  I will certainly return to try all of the vegan combinations. 

They sell Zapp's potato chips, which come in a variety of colorfully named flavors, like \"Voodoo Heat,\" \"Hotter'N Hot Jalapeño,\"Sweet Creole Onion,\" etc.  Looking at the ingredients on the bags (and I have since checked Zapp's website), it appears that only the Salt & Vinegar, and BBQ Ranch chips are not vegan (they contain a milk product), and all except the Mesquite BBQ are gluten-free. However, the source of the natural smoke flavor and \"natural flavor\" needs to be confirmed.  I also spotted MSG in at least one flavor.

I tried the Hotter'N Hot Jalapeño chips. I wasn't impressed. 0 heat. Not 1 hint of spice. And the taste was a little off; almost on the stale side, but the bag showed a November expiration date. Not sure what that was about. Next time I'll try a different flavor to see if there's any change. 


Management informed me of the following:

50% of the veggie sandwiches can be made vegan upon request. 
They use Daiya for the vegan cheese, Tofurkey for the vegan turkey, and Gardein for the vegan chicken and meatballs. 
All of their breads are vegan except for the wheat (it's honey wheat).
The wasabi mayo is automatically vegan, so no need to request a vegan version.
Their Dirty sauce is not vegan, but they offer a vegan version, (which is delicious, btw! Add it to your sandwich, or get it on the side and dip your sandwich in it. YUM!)
Fries (called \"Air Fries\") are vegan; they are baked, not fried.
Tater tots are vegan. 

Not vegan:
pesto, & honey mustard sauces, the fried foods, like onion rings & beer battered zucchini (egg based batter), and the obvious (meats and non-vegan cheeses). 
CORRECTION: Their Sun-Devil (a nod to Arizona State University/ ASU) is not vegan, & they do NOT have a vegan version. (The photo I added is actually their vegan Dirty sauce.)

Their veggie bacon is vegetarian; not vegan

Gluten-free bread available upon request.

I love the way it's decorated. It has a very warm, happy, and welcoming vibe. Friendly and vegan-knowledgable employees. Fountain drinks or bottled drinks available. Open late (until midnight) on Fri/Sat. There are few outside tables. Located in the heart of Tempe, next to the Bank of America off Mill, between 6th & 7th. Typical downtown Tempe street or paid lot parking.

SANDWICHES = MIND BLOWN!"}
{"text":"I've just recently learned of the fabulousness that is Ike's Love & Sandwiches, and I am a big fan!  

This was my first time at the Mesa location. I ordered the Vegan Pilgrim (vegan turkey, cranberry sauce, Sriracha, vegan dirty sauce + lettuce [I omitted the vegan cheese]) on their french roll/bread. I know, I know. That combination makes no sense, right? Wrong! I've learned to leave my inhibitions down the street and around the corner, and to just trust Ike's on whatever his board says. It. Was. So. Good!  (1/2 of this sandwich never made it out of my parking space!) Cranberry sauce + Sriracha on a \"turkey\" sandwich? Who'd a \"thunk\"?!

That's mostly what you'll find here. An amazing concoction of drool & moan-worthy creations (Meg Ryan/Sally, you ain't ready, girl!), surrounded by delicious, homemade bread. Their Dutch Crunch bread is a must try!  They also have a few simple sandwiches, for you retired daredevils. 

Supposedly, there are 100 veggie sandwich options, most of which can be veganized. So for all of my fellow vegans, just be sure to tell them to make it vegan. Here's a vegan breakdown:
They use Daiya for the cheeses, Tofurkey for the vegan turkey, and Gardein for the vegan chicken and meatballs. 
All of their breads are vegan except for the wheat (it's honey wheat). 
The wasabi mayo is automatically vegan, so no need to request a vegan version. 
The \"Air\" fries and tater tots are vegan (and they are baked, not fried).
Their Dirty Sauce is not vegan, but they offer a vegan version (it's delicious!)
Their purple coleslaw is vegan.
There's a vegan french dressing and BBQ sauce.

Not vegan: 
Their pesto, honey mustard sauce, the fried foods, like onion rings & beer battered zucchini (egg based batter), and the obvious (meats and non-vegan cheeses). 
Sun-Devil sauce is NOT vegan & there is no vegan version.

Veggie bacon is vegetarian; not vegan.

They have gluten-free options. 

The girl helping me out was super nice and knowledgeable about their vegan menu. I had a question about the french dressing, and she had a handy-dandy cheat sheet which she used to confirm that it is vegan (or they have a vegan option; I didn't clarify).

Most of the sandwiches are @ $10, but they are big enough to either share or save 1/2 for another day. They offer chips (most of which are vegan too; just avoid the Salt & Vinegar and the BBQ Ranch), bottled and fountain drinks. Nice sized location with plenty of tables and booths inside. There are only a couple of tables outside. It shares a big parking lot with other establishments, so there is plenty of parking.  Located about 3 lights north of US 60, off of the Alma School exit, on the east side of the street (opposite side of the street from the Fiesta Mall). 

Ike's is like the Lady Gaga of sandwiches: extravagant, daring, and shockingly good. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Incredible sandwiches,  incredible  price. Need a better soft drink selection with machine."}
{"text":"Tried  Ike's today for dinner and it was fabulous. Had the Tony Soprano and it was great. So many other sandwiches that I want to try, will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'm not one to use hyperbole, but the Bear Hug on Dutch crunch with the dirty sauce will...change...your...life. I'm also not one that usually likes ingredient changes, but they actually improved upon this sandwich by reducing the size."}
{"text":"Arguably one of best sandwich you will eat.  Made to order and delish.  The Ikes BBQ is amazing."}
{"text":"My roommate has been trying to get me to come to Ike's since I moved in with her. We finally made the trek over to Mill to try it out and my life was changed!

As an aspiring vegan, it can be pretty difficult to find satisfying, hearty meals that fit my dietary restrictions. I'm a sucker for a good sub, but that almost always requires some form of meat, cheese, or dairy/egg-based sauce. NO LONGER, MY FRIENDS. 

Ike's has sooo many vegan options (or vegetarian which can be turned vegan). And they are so chock full of goodness that you don't feel like you're depriving yourself. Everything on their menu is very well-labeled too so you know exactly what you're getting when you order. 

I chose the Sometimes-I'm-A-Vegetarian (ain't that the truth) and altered it to be vegan (took off the cheese). It. Was. Delicious. Their bread is probably the best part--super thick and somehow both crunchy and doughy. The sandwiches are huge, so you really get your money's worth. 

The staff was so friendly, I wish I could recall the name of my cashier because he was really great and helpful in offering suggestions. We came in 10 minutes to close and I didn't feel like we were being rushed out. 

'Would definitely visit again, way better than any chain sandwich store I've tasted. Oh, and the complimentary sucker with your order is a fancy touch too."}
{"text":"After sampling sandwiches at a yelp event I have been wanting to visit since then. We were finally in the area so we stopped by. There are several options to choose from on the menu including several vegetarian and vegan options. I went with the Pat Tillman which was roast beef, mushrooms and mozzarella sticks plus a bunch of other stuff like lettuce, tomato and the dirty sauce. This sandwich was very big and could easily be split between two people. My hubby had the Thunderbird and he really enjoyed it. In fact he said it was the best sandwich he has ever had. The prices are good for what you get but I think having a smaller less expensive size for lunch would be a plus. Would that stop me from returning? Heck no. That sandwich was amazing and the crunch bread-out of this world! Oh how I wish we had a location in the west valley!!"}
{"text":"The only place in town that I've found Dutch crunch bread. Great variety of sandwich options and awesome staff. Free lollipops too!"}
{"text":"I had my first trip here today after hearing about it from my co-workers. It was definitely worth passing all of the other sandwich shops to get to.

They have a nice big menu posted on the wall (be prepared to stare at it and try to figure out what deliciousness to choose). The restaurant was clean, and the person at the counter greeted me as soon as she could. I think her name was Kelsey. She was very personable and definitely didn't mind explaining to me the different options. 

I decided to try the meatball with jalapenos, and it was fantastic. I probably shouldn't have eaten the whole thing, but it was really good. 

I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Um quite possibly one of my favorite sandwiches ever.. Today was my first try and I will be back very soon !  I had the Barry with Avocado.."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review,  I love Ike's,  but they messed up my order twice. First I made the order over the phone, I ordered a reggie jackson, kevin bacon, elvis Keith, elvis Keith with no cheese and tomatoes,  and a pinky and the brain. I went and picked them up. When I got back to the office. There was no lettuce or tomatoes on the two elvis Keith and the pinky and the brain. The Kevin bacon and the reggie jackson were fine, they had lettuce and tomatoes . I went back to get it fixed. They replaced the sandwiches. When I got back to the office, they got the elvis Keiths  right,  one with lettuce and tomatoes and one with no cheese and just lettuce. The pinky and the brain had lettuce,  but no tomato. At that point I didn't want to go back a third time, so I just went ahead and ate it. I gave them a call and told them they got my order wrong again."}
{"text":"Not only is the food AMAZING!!! But the staff is also unbelievable helpful, friendly, and hilarious. Marco and Chase are too funny and are so absolutely dedicated to the success and reputation of their store...and I can see why! In my opinion, better than silver mines, pita pit, and jimmy johns that are all located on mill. I suggest the sourdough bread myself but I think it's safe to say that if you order anything, you're going to like it. Go Ike's!!!!"}
{"text":"This is the most I've ever paid for a lettuce wrapped sandwich. It is also the best lettuce wrapped sandwich I've ever had. I added steak to the Patino D, their daily special. This is one of those places where the special is the most expensive thing, and that's without the steak. 16 bucks later, my sandwich ruled all. Beat the heck out of a five dollar foot long.

I can't get over the fact that I paid that much for a sandwich. I'd do it again though."}
{"text":"First time here and I had the spiffy tiffy. Awesome sandwich I would definitely get it again. The atmosphere was cool, a lot of things to look at and read on the wall. Employees were really nice as well. Make sure to check in on here to get a free bag of chips. Oh and you also get free lollipops with your sandwich."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite grab and go lunch spot on Mill. This place is just awesome in every way. First off, the menu is fun with all the sandwiches named after famous folk and some some local ones thrown in for good measure. 

I think the best thing, besides the awesome food, is the staff. Everyone and I mean every single person every time I go in there is just so friendly and warm and exuding a love for their job. They chat with you about your day, make sure you leave happy and are just awesome to be around. Now the food itself is great too - the sandwiches are a monster size so i usually would go for the lunch combos which are a half sammy with chips and a drink on the cheap. Every single sandwich is amazing, espeically if you get it on the Dutch bread - hello crunchy factor to raise up the sandwich bread game! 

Try these guys out, you'll love it if you're in the mood for sandwiches...and LOVE-ly people :)"}
{"text":"I can't tell you how excited I am to have an Ike's in AZ! As a San Francisco native I crave good quality sandwiches on our famous Dutch Crunch bread. 

My husband and I ventured in today for the ultimate sandwich experience and Ike's, as usual did not disappoint. My hubster had the Barry B Turkey, Bacon, Swiss with dirty sauce on Dutch Crunch and I had my usual the Tony Soprano with turkey, salami, ham and provolone with Italian dressing and dirty sauce on Dutch Crunch. 
I've always loved how Ike's serves their sandwiches warm, do not confuse this with other sandwich shops version's of toasted. Ike's lightly warms their bread allowing the ingredients of the sandwich to come together! 

We will be back, and often. Thank you Ike's for showing AZ how a sandwich should be!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic sandwiches, especially if you go with the legendary Dutch Crunch bread. They also have authentic SF sourdough which is very good. Sandwiches are huge, though quite pricey. Service can be a bit slow if there's anyone in line ahead of you. Be aware that all sandwiches are hot \"unless otherwise noted\". Found out the hard way when ordering a ham & swiss by phone that I wanted cold - wasn't asked which way I wanted it, so hot it was. Also had more stuff on it than I asked for. Still quite tasty though."}
{"text":"Freakin amazing sandwich! The Ted Danson is my absolute favorite on Dutch crunch bread of course."}
{"text":"A bit pricey for a sandwich but at the same time I had great service and the menu is HUGE. Staff was very friendly from the second I walked in and even helped me decide what to get. The onion rings were awesome."}
{"text":"5 stars because it is the only sandwich shop worth revisiting. All the other major chain sandwich shops are the same, nothing special. I can make those sandwiches in my own kitchen (probably better ones). Not Ike's though, his sandwiches are one of a kind.

This location is relatively new and the service was a liiiiitle slow but the food was worth the wait! I ordered the bbq roast beef sandwich and it was oh so good. Generous portion of meat, appropriate portions of all the toppings and the secret sauce mixed with bbq sauce? yes please!!"}
{"text":"BEST SANDWICH PLACE EVER!!!!!! idk what they do but it's amazing! I had a fried chicken sandwich that came with pesto and honey and it was the best sandwich I have ever eaten. I love how they make unique sandwiches that you would never think of but it actually works great. So many selections and the staff is so awesome they basically become your friends! Don't worry about ordering mozzarella sticks or chips or whatver on the side because you don't need it and it's not that good anyways. Just order a sandwich and you will be stuffed out of your mind. Keep opening more locations Ike's!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try Ike's after seeing all the great reviews but I was disappointed. The service was great but the food wasn't. Onion rings were ok and so was my sandwich. My friend with me wasn't a big fan either. Neither of us felt very good when we left. I'm still giving it a 3 because of the service and I love the look of the menu. There were several sandwiches that sounded great to me so maybe I just made a poor choice. If I ever do go back I'll find out then"}
{"text":"The variety of sandwiches here will spin your head, but over the course of several meals I have discovered you can't really go wrong with any of them. Fresh ingredients and thoughtful combinations create some amazing flavor profiles.  Anything with their mayo based dirty sauce and dutch crunch bread is a dinner in my books. The sandwiches are pricier than you have come to expect from places like jimmy johns, but they are massive portions worth every penny. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Four stars only because it is a little pricey (we paid $34 for two sandwiches, an order of 4 mozzarella sticks, and one fountain drink). The sandwiches are really big and filling, but I could have gone to a sit down restaurant for that price.

The dutch crunch bread is a must! I think the \"thing\" about the dutch crunch is that the cheese is baked into the crust? Honestly, I do not care what the \"thing\" is, it is unlike any other sandwich bread.

 I had the Menage a Trois and my hubby had the Bear Hug. Both were delicious. 

The mozzarella sticks are not worth the $4 or $5 they are charging. 

You may want to research the menu online before going in the first time so you are not completely overwhelmed."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this place.  A friend of mine raved about it and decided to do a lunch run.  I was amazed at the selection of sandwiches to choose from.  I ended up ordering the Pat Tillman with Dutch Crunch bread.  WOW.  This sandwich was awesome!  It was so good that I didn't even have time to take a picture of it before I ate it.  My friend ordered the Bruce Wayne with the Dutch Crunch bread.  That's his favorite sandwich and that's all he ever orders.  I'm going to give that one a try next time.  Yes, there will definitely be a next time.

The place was pretty clean and the woman who served me was very friendly and polite.  I really don't have anything bad to say about this place at all.  If I absolutely had to gripe about something, I'd say that this place is a bit pricier than other options.  It's for that reason that I don't know that I'd be a regular, but it's definitely not a place to pass up if given the chance to try it."}
{"text":"I tried the veggie meatball sandwich and was I impressed! It was delicious and very filling. And they gave me Carmel apple suckers with my meal."}
{"text":"I stopped by this place for a quick lunch in between classes. I recommend the Julius Caesar. You get a good amount of dressing which makes the chicken taste great. This one is definitely my go to!"}
{"text":"They have the most amazing gluten free sandwiches ever - on bread that doesn't taste like sand.  The staff is also very friendly.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is awesome. The employee helped us with selection and explained in detailed what each of the sandwiches were. We felted very welcomed here. The 2 sandwiches we decided on were Tony soprano and Adam Richmond. Both were delicious and so full of flavor. I have to say these were the best sandwiches we ever had, hands down. Period! It's definitely worth the drive!
The employee tells me there are plans to open another store in North Scottsdale. I say, Yes please!"}
{"text":"Very rarely do I give out 5 stars. Today is that day. I already have a favorite sandwich place that I eat at in Vegas and none has topped it in the many years that I have frequented that place. Today is the day that the crown is placed on another. There were so many different delicious sounding sandwiches to choose from that I kept ordering then changing my mind  and choosing a different one. I wish I had 5 extra stomaches. I finally decided to order the Adam Richman sandwich because we follow him on Man Vs Food. Let me tell you , the moment I but into it, rockets flared, music played and a beautiful butterfly metamorphosized. It was like I was eating the equivalent of Beyoncé mixed with Angelina Jolie's \"talents\". Today the food gods  shined upon me and I smiled back as I took another bite into what life is about....ECSTASY"}
{"text":"Bomb sandwiches, but holy hell they need to do something about calling in orders when they're busy.  I called twice between 12-12:15 and they put me on hold for 6+ minutes before I hung up both times..."}
{"text":"Serious sandwiches! I'd seen this a few times and never tried it and in so glad I finally did. Crazy awesome selection and top quality ingredients. The service was fast and friendly, can't wait to go back and try something else!"}
{"text":"Eating a \"Sometimes I'm Vegetarian\" sandwich. AMAZING! I have found my new go-to sandwich shop. Such a wide array of things to choose from, no matter if you're a meat-eater, vegetarian, vegan, or gluten-free. I little pricey with sandwiches around $8-10. But worth it!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, good atmosphere and a good change from the other places around here. The sandwich was really fu@$#ng good. I am going to try them all."}
{"text":"Tried to come here last week and they said they didn't receive their shipment and had NO food to make anything. Came back today and they were out of halal chicken, tomato and straws. The wait takes FOREVER - don't come here if you are in a hurry. Not sure what's going on with this location lately. Never had an issue before but the last two times I've been here I've been very disappointed."}
{"text":"Great service, the menu is huge, and the fried chicken is to die for. Had the Kelly Kawpowski: so good!!!!"}
{"text":"My 3 year old asked if they had marshmallows and lo and behold they had marshmallow fluff. My husband got the Randy Hahn. He said it was good, but nothing to write home about. I got the Madison Bumgarner with lettuce and tomato. It was very good, but my sandwich cost as much as my husbands sandwich, drink, and chips. Portion to prices are a little off, ( over $30 for lunch) but worth checking out again."}
{"text":"This was my first time to Ikes. I asked what the most popular sandwich was and was told it was the Matt Cain. The sandwich was good and had an ample amount of meat. The problem was that the sandwich was tiny and the sauce was very overpowering. I got a small sandwich soda and chips for 16 bucks. Sorry that's way too much to be paying for a meal that left me hungry."}
{"text":"I don't know why I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5. It is my go-to for sandwiches now that I'm gluten free. The best of the best. My favorite is the Reggie Jackson"}
{"text":"Service was pretty slow in spite of them being not that busy. Prices are a bit high. Overall good food but it didn't feel worth the expense and time waiting (my friends' sandwiches came out in five minutes but it took 15 minutes for mine)."}
{"text":"These could quite possibly be some of my favorite sandwiches of all time.
I work nearby so I've gotten to try a lot of the Mill restaurants but this has become a regular. 

I haven't had a bad sandwich yet but so far the MILF and Linda Carter on the Dutch Crunch bread are winning. 

They also have a really good gluten free bread, according to a coworker this is annoyingly impossible to find."}
{"text":"I love sandwiches...like LOVE them, so I was really excited to check this place out. I was born and raised in the S.F.bay area and had never heard of Ike's. Sadly I'm not sure what all the fuss is about. It looked and sounded amazing, but myself and my 2 sons were not impressed.  We drove 23 minutes each way, and 3 sandwiches were $32...no drinks or chips. I ordered the Nacho Boy, my oldest got the Adam Richman (I think that's the name), and my youngest got a peanut butter and nutella. None of us finished our food. I maybe ate half of one half before calling it quits. My youngest threw his out after 3 bites of  really hard bread and made himself a nutella and peanut butter on sliced bread, and my oldest who eats everything in sight barely finished half of his. Truly a disappointing lunch. I will say that the decor was fun, the restaurant clean,  and the menu extensive. If someone insisted on eating at Ike's, I might try something else, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there."}
{"text":"Great service!! Friendly staff! The Vegan selection of sandwiches is great! I got the Meatless Mike, Vegan style, with Creole Onion Kettle Chips. It was so delicious!! I just wish they had a larger selection of healthy natural beverages but I settled for the country time lemonade. Next time I will just bring my own drink but I would definitely visit again! Great place!"}
{"text":"I always love Ikes and happen to be a veteran visiting from California. I must say, the staff is friendly and the music is great. Food is up to par with all other Ikes locations I've been to (key to a good restaurant), and the spread of Ikes has just added guilty pleasure locations in all the right places.

For anyone who complains that there is too much dirty, are you amateur eaters? When ordering they ask \"would you like dirty?\" There are three ways to answer that:

\"Yes\"
\"Yes, but not too much\" ( they put half the normal amount.\"
\"No\"

If that's too difficult for you, maybe you should let someone else order for you. Not fair to such an amazing place that people leave one star reviews for something that they can easily fix.

Now all you had to do is figure out how to get Cake Monkey baked goods out to the AZ locations. :)"}
{"text":"I have fallen in love with Ike's. They have a huge variety of hot and cold sandwiches. Their Dutch crust bread is excellent as are their other breads. My friend was visiting from out of town and is wheat-intolerant. They offer gluten free bread, which was such a welcomed sight for her! She really enjoyed her food. The place is clean and well-lit! They also have Zapp's chips and offer deliciously seasoned french fries too. Highly recommend the Mark Appel with mushrooms added and the Matt Cain with jalapeños and pickles. Only downside is you have to pay for parking in downtown Tempe because it's on Mill Ave. regardless - definitely returning!"}
{"text":"Another place I didn't really have high expectations for.

Ordered the Paul Rubens (pastrami, coleslaw, cheese) on the dutch crunch roll (or whatever it was called).  Added a side of fried zucchini.

Will start with the bad.  The zucchini was bleh (that's below meh).  The ranch that came with it was beyond cheap.  If you go to a grocery store and look in the salad dressing aisle half of what you'll see is ranch dressing.  So how this place could end up with an awful ranch dressing is beyond me.

With the above being said I didn't let the zucchini color my view of the place other than I'd never order it again.

As for the sandwich it was surprisingly good.  I added lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, onion and banana peppers so the sandwich was really stacked.  The bread (dutch crunch) was really good...perhaps the best at any sandwich place I've been to in quite a while.  Overall I'd order the sandwich again.

My only concern with the place is that the variety of sandwiches they serve is so large at some point I would be afraid they would lose quality. I'll have to order a few other things before I can make that call."}
{"text":"In Mesa today shopping for Christmas present. Lunch time. Made a call to my son. He does a lot of driving and knows a lot of good places to eat in this area. 
My wife and I got sandwiches and enjoyed them. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches! So many options and there's even more online! The sandwiches are HUGE! My fiancé and I both ended up only eating half and he can eat, so I would recommend sharing a sandwich if you don't like leftovers. Great music as well."}
{"text":"Heard great things about this sandwich shop from the bay area so I had to try it.

The important thing was the bread, That bread, all baked fresh by Ike's, is superb. The \"world-famous\" Dutch crunch is more chew than crunch, the first half of the Dutch Crunch was good but began to be too much,  Other bread options are French, sourdough, whole wheat and gluten-free.Will try the sourdough next time.

The menu is huge and the worker helped decide what to order and recommend.

The Tempe location is small with about 6 tables but the kitchen is massive, it took a little longer than expected to make the sandwiches.

I ordered the Cain Velasquez,which had bacon pastrami and swiss, the meat was generous and the sandwich was loaded. I could only eat half the sandwich. 

I will definitely come back again but try the other breads."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I had...how could I not?...the Pat Tillman. I think it was roast beef, cheese and mozzarella sticks (on the sandwich). Really great flavor. The place got really busy right after the noon hour, so plan ahead. Huge menu. 

I went there b/c my friends are vegetarians. These guys do just about any sandwich to meet your dietary needs.

And, they seem to have a good, healthy attitude there. You'll know what I mean when you visit. 

Too bad Hertz can't run it's company like Ike's."}
{"text":"They have really good gluten free bread and a ton of options to suite every diet or allergy.

The downsides: the taste, size, and price. You get a sub that is waaaaaay smaller than subway for example. The ingredients are sparse, they're what i imagine sandwiches looked like during the great depression - all bread. It's weird too because lettuce, tomatoes, onions - they cost next to nothing and yet when you add them to your sub their hard to find (literally, i open up my sub and try finding them to confirm they are on there because you can't taste them.)

Lastly, for what you get, the price is insane. Compare the amount if food and ingreidents in a $7 chipotle burrito or subway sub to a $10 ike's sub.

Ike, if you really do love us, put things in between the bun."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious, and unique subs at Ike's. I've been exploring their menu and absolutely haven't had a bad experience. Current favorites are the Pirates of the Caribbean, and Sometimes I'm A Vegetarian. So many choices."}
{"text":"Unique joint. Great food. Big portions. I hate writing reviews. Stop reading this and just eat here for crap's sake."}
{"text":"Ok, not to sound cliché, but Ike's really is the BOMB.COM

Think of any other sandwich shop you've ever been to....ok, got it? Well, Ike's is NOTHING like whatever you're thinking right now...for realzzzz!!! This place will blow your mind. They literally have HUNDREDSof hot sandwiches to chose from (go online, you will see that each location will make a specific bunch of sandwiches, but each restaurant is ready to make whatever you want, from whatever other Ike's you might want) 

So, not only do you have your pick of delicious hot sandwiches, but, you even get your pick of breads! They offer like 5 different options, including gluten free. Speaking of gluten free, if you are intolerant or celiac, they will ask you because they will arrange a special sandwich making station so that there is no cross-contamination. Very caring company! They even have dozens of vegetarian and vegan options...their vegan meatball is, hands down, better than the real thing. 

You will never get board here, and these puppies will definitely fill you up! Whenever we go get one, this is all my husband and I will eat all day; so filling. I have officially kissed all other sandwich restaurants goodbye!"}
