{"text":"Recently opened, this restaurant took over the previous San Francesco location right across from 777 Bay Street (College Park). You won't miss the delicious smell of the grill, and it's the perfect place for lunch or dinner. The portions are huge, and most dishes come with a side of bread. It's the ultimate place for Afghani comfort food. The prices are more than fair for downtown Toronto, which is perfect for both residents and students in the area looking for a quick bite. The restaurant is a walk-up fast-food styled restaurant, but does not skimp on quality.   I've already made their restaurant a staple and I'm already looking forward to my next meal there!"}
{"text":"I'd never had Afghan kabob before but grew up eating Persian kabob. This is a bit different, and incredibly tasty. I had the chicken kofta meal (one chicken skewer, one ground meat skewer, rice, salad and naan). The kofta was spiced just right and to those used to other kinds of kabob, just a tiny bit spicy. The chicken was seasoned well, and extra tasteful in the well barbecued spots. The rice was good, the salad was standard issue and a refreshing accompaniment, with a really delicious and tangy dressing/sauce. You get more of this sauce on the side, and it goes so well with the meats and naan. Speaking of which, the naan is fresh and soft. You also get a side of their salsa like hot topping which seems to be freshly made and is both refreshing and spicy. Like others have mentioned, they're still working out the kinks, but I was in and out in ten minutes on a Friday night, and the cashier was incredibly friendly. Will definitely return!   (Note that they are grilling a lot of meat so that delicious smell will permeate your clothes. If you are sensitive about that or have somewhere to go afterwards, keep that in mind. But it sure will keep you craving more!)"}
{"text":"I like this place! It's what the neighborhood needed!   The kebabs are awesome! I had the chicken kebabs, but the mixed combo platter looked delicious.  The naan is fresh and the service friendly.  This is a three star review as there are some kinks to be worked out. The wait time is moderate but will likely improve as they iron out the process.  I ordered salad only instead of with rice but it was a fairly small salad. :(  Overall, I enjoyed my lunch and I will revisit. :) There are wraps and vegetarian options too."}
{"text":"We stopped at this Afghan kebab house today and we had some excellent lamb shank with fragrant rice and salad. The service was very friendly, they told me that had opened only just recently. Even though the place was almost full, our food arrived without delay.  The menu looked quite extensive with many kebab options and even a few vegetarian and vegan options."}
{"text":"Glad to have an Afghanistan kabob House near my work.   Silk Road is located on Bay Street tucked underneath a condo building, however the aroma of grilled meat wafting through the streets will you lead you right to the restaurant's doorsteps.  After much debating, I ordered the kofta combo which came with two giant kabobs, a hefty portion of rice, mixed green salad and the best tasting naan I've had in awhile.  Th kofta kabob meat is minced beef that has been well spiced  and  cooked on a grilled to give that desirable char and smoky flavour. All meals are made to order so it does require some wait time, especially during lunch hour where the line-ups go out the door. There are also wraps available for those who want a smaller meal. Takeout is probably your best bet, as there aren't too many tables. Silk Road is a welcoming addition to this neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Had tikka  Smells amazing ! Best Naan I've ever tried!  Lots of rice.... though the rice tastes pretty good  Beef is so hard to chew!!! There isn't much meat to begin with yet I can't swallow the meat.....(though the meat smells good.... )  Will come back to try the chicken dishes and ofc the naan ;)"}
{"text":"I had kabob for lunch and was disappointed. The meat was blunt, not enough spices to make it tasty."}
{"text":"Amazing! I Yelped somewhere for lunch today while in the city & found this little gem. My husband & I shared the plate of chicken tandoori & ground beef kabobs, it came with a decent sized salad & super yummy whole grain naan bread for $14++ I'm not sure I took a breath while eating!! Haha, it seriously was really good. Great flavor, quality & price. Only downside was The place was Smokey inside from the cooking. Some extra ventilation & this place is perfect!"}
{"text":"4.5/5 Great place, really happy it replaced the mediocre San Francesco. Good portion, good price, great taste.  Loses half a point for not having some kind of yogurt or hummus sauce for dipping on the side, but otherwise great."}
{"text":"Bread and kabobs are worse than in other Afghan places in Toronto.  2 stars for cutting portions sizes in half.  They opened half a year ago. Compared to a month ago now bread and rice are easily half of the old potion, and they try as hard as possible to not give you the side sauces. Not sure how much the meat portion was reduced."}
{"text":"Great value for the price. I've been waiting for a good afghan kabob place to open up downtown so this place is much welcomed and it didn't disappoint. I ordered a chicken kabob and kofta plate while my wife ordered the veggie wrap. The chicken kabob was very tender and the kofta very flavourful. We had to wait about 10 minutes or so for our order - not unreasonable. This place has some seats for dining in but it's made to be more of a take out place. Portion sizes were also quite big so I was definitely stuffed by the end of it. See pictures.  Worth noting is that the menu has a good selection of vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken tandoori and kofta kebab with salad and naan. Pretty tasty food with a warm and soft whole wheat naan. Service was relatively quick and friendly. The place had an enticing smell of grilled meats.   They also have desserts such as firni, cake and baklava.  Would return for their qorma and paneer dishes!"}
{"text":"Absolute worse service. I got two cold naans with my Chapli kabob, when I asked for a fresh naan my same two cold naans were put into the oven and warmed up, burned up, then slammed onto my table. Horrible service. ZERO etiquettes on how to weight on Customers."}
{"text":"I was drawn into Silk Road for lunch by the irresistible grilled meat smells wafting onto the street. I had the kofte (meatball) wrap. It was pretty good, but didn't have the intense grilled flavour I was hoping for. Toppings are a tad bland and I could have used a little more meat in the wrap as well. Nevertheless, a solid lunch option in the area. I plan to be back."}
{"text":"They are working out some new business kinks. They say it is open at 11:00, and went by 2 previous times at 11:30 and they were not ready.  Today I finally was able to order. I had the Kofta Meal (2 ground beef kabobs, rice and naan. $13.50 after tax) It was to go, and was served very quickly. I've been to a few other kabob restaurants and this is right up there with them. I really enjoyed the meal. Large portion, super fresh and tasty naan, and the meat was seasoned nicely.  In this area, it is a solid option."}
{"text":"Delicious food but INCREDIBLY slow service. Like waiting at least 15-20 mins for an order. If the establishment could somehow find a way to be more efficient , then it would be a 4 star"}
