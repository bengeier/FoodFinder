{"text":"I ordered Thai red curry vegetable, had a bite and realized the sauce was spoilt. The owner refused to provide a refund, despite recognizing me a regular customer. He gave me juice bottles are a method of refund. Very disappointed with the service and food!"}
{"text":"I happened upon this place while taking a trip to the Home Depot located in the same building, and I'm happy I decided to take a chance on it. As far as food court fare goes, I was pretty impressed!
First off, the staff was friendly, helpful, and made sure they filled every square inch of the container my food came in. For $9 I got rice, veggies, chicken, two small spring rolls, and a fortune cookie. And boy was I full when I finished most of it. 
The food itself was tasty, hot, and well cooked. Nice tender chicken, crisp vegetables, properly cooked rice, and crispy spring rolls. 
The rice was a little plain, but since it was meant to be an accoutrement to the other food, it still added to the flavour of the rest of the food. I could have used a little less cabbage in the vegetable mix, and more of a better type of veggie, like broccoli, but that was a minor preference on my part. 
I was also happy with the food court itself. Lots of tables, and kept very clean. A man was going around the entire time I was there picking up garbage, cleaning off tables, sweeping the floor, etc. He even held open the garbage container when I went to dump my trash. 
Definitely will stop here again next time I'm in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE. Horrible Customer Service.
I ordered A Chicken dish with rice and vegetables. Took a little while to talk to the server, which was fine since of the language barrier. The price was fair overall. When I got to my table I notice she didn't put any plastic utensils, I went back and got some. But one of the ladies stopped me and said only paying customers allowed to take one, I explained that I ordered here. She was utterly rude and said I had to pay for plastic utensils, I left without. The chicken I order tasted subpar and the rice was hard and veggies had been too long."}
{"text":"I'm giving a star just because I cannot give less.

This place is located in the food court at Square One in Mississauga, Ontario (close to Toronto). We arrive around 18h00 (6pm) on a Wednesday and the counter was empty so my fianc√©e and I decided to give it a try.

Big mistake, I ordered the chicken fried rice and, somehow, I ended up with a beef fried rice. If the dish would have been well cooked it wouldn't have been any problem: The rice half cooked, tasteless (and I even asked to make it \"spicy\"), vegetables raw (onion and carrots) and the meet full of fat and cartilage.

From my girlfriend's feedback i could only say that her pad thai was extremely oily and tasteless as well, since she's a vegetarian she didn't mind the raw vegetables.

My best advice avoid the \"fried rice\" or this restaurant at all."}
{"text":"Located right inside Gerrard Square's food court, it's really nothing special

Service: your average food court fast food service style with an old Chinese lady (at the time I was there), can't expect much, but not rude.

Food: Nothing gourmet like the name, but if you're craving the average American style Chinese fast food like Manchu-Wok or Shanghai 360, this can be your alternative choice in the mall with similar prices"}
{"text":"It seems I am unable to give it 0 stars.

Anyway I didn't have much time and other lines were full so I grabbed their sweet and sour chicken with veggie fried rice.

Food was cold, bland and I found a hair in it. Nothing gourmet about this place.

Avoid!"}
