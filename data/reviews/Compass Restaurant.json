{"text":"I had come across this very cool restaurant/lounge while staying at the hotel whete it is located.  The music along with the ambiance at this restaurant was very contemporary and well, just overall pretty cool!  From the luminescent pepper mill to the lit up \"thingy\" your check comes in for signing.  We found the service to be friendly and attentive.  In regards to food, I had their hamburger and fries.  The hamburger was excellent! It was cooked perfectly so was juicy and seasoned well.  The French fries it came with was a slight miss as they did not seem fresh and there were a lot of short fries (ie 1 - 1 1/2 inch length pieces) so it seemed evident this batch was at the end of the bag...  Aside from that, everything was really good!"}
{"text":"I usually get their beef dip and salad, this morning I was too late for the buffet so I tried their cowboy breakfast with an omelette on top of home fries, mushrooms and spicy chorizo sausage. The whole thing was topped with cheese and a creamy sauce that I think was b√©chamel.   Good but very rich and sausage was too spicy (but may suit some of you who love spices). Next time I will get something lighter like the delta classic which comes with toast. That is what this cowboy plate is missing. If you are hungry, giddy up! Ps. They give you a nice thermos of Starbucks coffee with breakfast so that's a bonus."}
{"text":"My experience here was disappointing. I saw on the menu a \"vegan inspired\" veggie burger and a line about working with customers with dietary restrictions, so I thought I'd be able to enjoy a vegan meal here.  Unfortunately, I never got a clear answer on whether the \"vegan inspired\" burger was actually vegan. Our server didn't know, and had to ask the chef. A manager came over and said they thought the burger patty was vegan, but not sure about the bun which was gluten-free. They did give an ingredient list for the burger patty, but it didn't list every ingredient (it said \"BBQ sauce\"- what's in that?) and the bun still seemed out of the question. I ended up just having sweet potato fries, and they served it to me with a mayo-type dressing to really solidify that they weren't understanding the whole vegan thing.  I don't blame anyone working that night- they seemed to be doing their best with a lousy menu and in an area they weren't trained in. Our waiter was very nice and I really appreciated his efforts. But I do blame the people who designed this menu and don't appear to give their employees the training and knowledge to do as the menu says- help customers with diet restrictions. \"Vegan-inspired\" is a ridiculous thing, to me, to put on a menu. It's like saying \"gluten-free inspired\" but not being sure if there's gluten in the meal.  I was told the menu was designed by a recently departed chef, and they will be coming up with a new menu. If they provide multiple vegan options, and clearly label them, so customers don't have to be so unsure of what they are eating, I will gladly update this review since they will have fixed the things that most disappointed me here and I would give this place another chance."}
{"text":"First time i ever had steak and eggs for breakfast was here a year ago. I've had a looong week and I'm on the last leg home decided it was best to start the day with this delicious breakfast again... Not disappointed, again it's delicious!!!"}
{"text":"What can I say.   My friend was passing through Calgary and invited me to come keep her company for the night.    We had a terrific dinner here.   The butter chicken was pleasant, no comparison to the great Indian food found in Calgary but good enough for an airport hotel.  My favorite had to be the simple but delicious goat cheese pistachio spinach salad.     But as I sit here eating my off the menu omelette this morning I find myself highly disappointed.  My cold and limp hashbrowns remind me of the iceberg that sunk the mighty Titanic.   This breakfast broke this review.   Normally in my experience,  people saute the veggies before they add egg to a omelette.   Maybe I'm an omelette snob?   Have all my travels ruined me?  Or had this place ruined a perfectly good omelette.     I guess they focus more on the breakfast buffet.  It wasn't the $22.00 price tag that put me off.   I just can't eat $22.00 worth of food.     You win some.   You lose some.   Dinner win.  Breakfast Fail."}
{"text":"I love going to the airport. It always relaxes me and makes me feel like I'm going on vacation, even if I'm not.  Compass Restaurant is located in the Delta and is a hidden gem in our city and without debate the best dining option you have in the airport.  Arriving with my mom for lunch, my (last) name was taken and we were promptly seated at a big, comfy table.  Compass looks onto both the hotel pool and main terminal and the opposite view is that of the people departing the airport.  There's something wonderfully tranquil about sitting down to enjoy a meal while you watch all these other suckers, I mean people, rush about.  Upon being greeted as \"Mr.B\" (a little too formal for my jeans and leather jacket wearing self but it's a business crowd who lunches here) we were presented with the specials of the day and the menus by our bubbly server.  Compass dedicates itself to both regional ingredients (which goes beyond Alberta beef) and Ocean Wise seafood.  Our consciousness assuaged, we ordered two glasses of Jackson Triggs VQA merlot ($9/glass) to keep it Canadian and ordered two soups to start.  My mom had the  BC dungeness crab bisque and I had the ale (Big Rock Trad) and onion soup.  I never got a chance to try the bisque and my mom never spoke to me for the 10 minutes it was on the table so I assume it was very, very good. So I was told anyways.  The ale and onion soup was a cheesy, rich soup. With a nice finish provided by the ale. There were big chunks of onion in it too, which is often forgotten in favour of the bread and cheese.   For the mains, we each had a burger. Alberta tenderloin, caramelized onions, jack daniels sauce, tomatoes, and lettuce on a soft, fresh bun.  Compass also offers burger upgrades a plenty. Avocado, hot peppers, and tons of cheeses. Tons.   I had maple cheddar and my mom had bleu. The cheese was substantial and added a wonderful flavour to each.  For sides, we each had a crisp, fresh salad with housemade bleu cheese and raspberry vinaigrette.  We were both full after the burger and salad, something common for my 60+ mom but totally uncommon for yours truly. It was a satisfying lunch for sure.  Compass also does a killer brunch on Sundays and all day breakfast 7 days a week.  As an added bonus, since no one ever thinks of going eating there unless they're already at the airport, you are guaranteed a table (although for Sunday brunch I was told to make a reso).  The service was totally warm and professional. The server was also eager to explain how the food was made and where it was sourced from. Good for a native Calgarian like myself to know, and even better for the international tourist to spread by word of mouth once they get home.  Overall, Compass is a winner. Offering fine dining food and service with within a relaxed atmosphere.  Even if your aren't stepping across the road into the terminal, and into your next vacation."}
{"text":"Unable to sleep last night .... I got out of bed bright and early to grab myself a 6:30 breakfast at compass.   I waited to be seated. (Less than 1 minute)  Started the day with a Globe and Mail, and option of coffee or juice was immediately offered. ($3.95 for coffee)  Server was super pleasant despite it being so early in the morning and the rush of people. (tour group)  15 minutes passed by quickly with my Globe in hand.  Breakfast was served.  The presentation of the classic Benedict was pretty and colourful, but the overall taste was average. I added salmon to it for $3. I probably shouldn't have... But even if I didn't add the salmon, the dish makes you think of the phrase \"less is more\". There was too much going on the plate that it was a bit overwhelming on the palate. Especially so, earlier on in the morning. The flavor of the hollandaise sauce was a bit too much. The potatoes were a bit overly seasoned with black pepper. The extra pan fried onion and 3 colored peppers on the side was unnecessary in my opinion seeing how it made my fruit on the side warm.   Not the best eggs Benedict I ever had, but it's a convenient option if you're staying at the hotel and don't feel like braving the cold for anything else.   Average food, but.... Service was excellent! Staff is super friendly!"}
