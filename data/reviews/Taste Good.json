{"text":"The sign outside the restaurant caught my eye as we were driving from the airport to my mother-in-law's house in Scarborough, which is literary just across the street .  \"Original Filipino Style Lechon\" so I was determined  to give it a try ...  We were here 3 years ago and remember this place was a Pizza place...Ah well...in today's economy...you are here today & gone tomorrow...My husband , sister in-law & I went in  the following day and found out that they are serving breakfast...I tried the Hot shrimp dumpling soup with thin yellow Noodles.$4.99 it came in a big large bowl I have just to share it with my husband, .He ordered a simple one at first...Two eggs...over easy with toast & coffee.$3.99..but was not satisfied..then glanced at the menu & saw Stewed Braised Lamb with rice & ordered it..$5.99.. & he enjoyed it...Not bad ..and the price is very affordable.  I spoke to the waitress & the head owner , both chinese & ask about the lechon and believe me, there was nothing Filipino in their lechon...it was Chinese pork barbecue...the word \"Style\" gave it away...nobody can make Lechon like the Filipinos, ..even Anthony Bourdain conceded to that!!  .."}
{"text":"2.5 star   It is fair for me to rate Taste Good B.B.Q. just based on breakfast with no BBQ items at all??   Breakfast Special starts from $2.50 with plain congee and fried dough, you will be full with carbs...I am not complaining.   I am cheap but I am not that cheap...so I opt for the most expensive breakfast choice on the menu!!! Congee with choice of noodle for $3.99!   Salted Meat with Thousand Year Old Egg was quite disappointing as there was hardly that much egg inside.. to some of you it might be a blessing as they are really high in cholesterol. The congee itself did taste like homemade, but is it good or bad?? Noodles were kind of stale and feel like it has been under the heated lamp for awhile...   Taste Good BBQ serves food at food court prices and with food court qualities...so If you looking for a cheap meal, you won't be disappointed!   Lunch Specials starts at $4.99.... but would I be brave enough to try that? I might just stick with their BBQ next time!"}
{"text":"Just got in. It's basically a standard turo turo Chinese style like You would see in food courts only clean looking which is a big change for me. They had a waitress waiting for you as you come in so it's like a fine dining in disguise.  Just ordered BBQ pork and egg fried rice.  It's a pretty big dish.  The taste is pretty much standard though unfortunately.  If they actually served up the Lechon as a regular dish rather than special ordering it.  This may get more stars.  They jusy got +1 star from me because of the atmosphere, unfortunately you cannot savor atmosphere alone."}
