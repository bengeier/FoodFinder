{"text":"Ate here a few months back while on a road trip. Some of the tastiest food we experienced. The flavors were awesome. Martha was friendly and very helpful in assisting us with our choices. We wish her continued success."}
{"text":"Excellent food! You won't be disappointed! I have tried the carnitas and the pesto chicken, they are both very good."}
{"text":"Small place, amazingly good food!  Home made Sinaloa style food...  great place you must try.."}
{"text":"Fantastic authentic food. The beef and green chili tacos are wonderful. Good salsa bar"}
{"text":"Some of the best homemade and fresh Mexican food I have ever had! Phenomenal service! I can't wait to go back to try all of her items. Excellent!"}
{"text":"Very nice staff and very good food. We were very impressed with the service and highly recommend it."}
{"text":"We drove out to Mesa for an appointment and found this place on Yelp. It had great review's so we thought we'd give it a try! We definitely picked a good restaurant, the food is homemade and amazing! Martha is super sweet and made us feel comfortable as soon as we walked in. 10/10 would drive all the way out here from Phx to eat her food  P.S. We had the barbaco burrito, creamy chicken cilantro pesto, and barbacoa tacos  and the horchata was da bomb!!"}
{"text":"Great food!!!! Everything is made from scratch and couldn't come from a nicer woman. Must try."}
{"text":"The place is really small but pretty clean. Was pretty satisfied with the food especially the green chile carnitas and the pesto cilantro cream chicken - yummy! The Barbacoa was a little salty and the sauce runny -but 
could have been just off that day. Will return to try out other dishes!"}
{"text":"It's ok. More of a take out, then a sit down and eat type place. Food is pretty good for what it is."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  In a city full of Mexican food this one stands out.  Everything is scratch made and all with a little twist.  My recommendation is to go with the three taco platter which gives you a sample of the three meat choices Martha offers.

When we arrived Martha greeted us and seemed genuinely glad that we were there.  When we asked about the menu choices she lit up and told us all about each of menu items.  If you go, take the time to talk to Martha and feel the passion she has for what she does.  She told us great stories of how her cooking originated in the region of Mexico she grew up in.

The restaurant can be a little hard to find.  It's on the west side of a building that looks as if it's attached to gas station.  Make the effort to find it, I promise it will be worth the effort."}
{"text":"Martha's Kitchen did a catering job for us for 16 people.  We had enchiladas, barbacoa tacos and chicken tostadas as well as beans, rice and two of their salsa's  It was fantastic.  All of our friends raved about the flavor of the food.  Absolutely the best Mexican food we have had in a VERY long time."}
{"text":"Great mexican food. Easy to order. Home made dishes. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Stopped in with my son. Martha was very friendly and accommodating.  I had the barbocoa burrito with beans and rice. My son had the three taco dinner. Also had chips and salsa. Very impressed with the food. Salsa bar was fresh and very good tasting salsas.  Burrito tacos rice beans all excellent.  Recommend Marthas to anyone looking for good mexican food."}
{"text":"Authentic made from scratch Mexican food that is delicious!  The food is so good! One of my many favorites is the barbacoa quesadilla, it is awesome.  Also try the amazing strawberry dessert!  My girlfriend loved the quinoa salad."}
{"text":"very good barbequoa tacos and quesidillias.  We also order pozole to go it was very good.  The owner gave us samples of her lambs soup.  very good also.  We will definitely go back again.  You get our vote.  Highly recommend.  Home made and nice decor.

{"text":"Good barbacoa tacos yummy. Delicious beans and rice. Great quesadillas!! Try the mochis tacos de barbacoa!!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time like I did. I found this place online trying to find new local mexican food. Drove down there and at first the owner tried to make me look/feel dumb by telling me my cards declined. After I told him there was no way that was correct he realized he wasnt getting a dial tone and that it was his fault. He did not apologize or do anything to attempt to get the machine to work, just handed me my card back, gave me a dirty look, and sent me down the road hungry. There are plenty of places in this area to get good authentic mexican food that is family owned and has their act together. I would recommend finding one of those places. I would have given it Zero stars if that was a option since I didn't even get to try the food."}
{"text":"Martha's Kitchen is not only delicious but it is so cute and welcoming. Martha is so nice and makes you feel at home. The price is reasonable and the dishes are perfect sized. Really recommend trying this place out."}
{"text":"I had the Barbacoa and it was absolutely amazing. Very friendly staff the owner helped us directly and explained the menu definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Delicious authentic home-made mexican food! My personal favorite is the tasty Cilantro-Pesto Cream Chicken. I come back and order this every time. Customer service is amazing and the owner/chef comes and checks on clients constantly. I wish there were more restaurants like evrywhere."}
{"text":"Delicious..very fresh..Martha is doing a great job with this restaurant..everthing we've  had has been delish ..a must try.."}
{"text":"This place is tough to figure out. They only have three choices on the menu including chicken in pesto cilantro cream sauce, barboacoa and carnitas. Yes, it is family owned and Martha actually cooks for you and delivers the food and checks on you as well. 
     Two minor complaints were if your making me homemade food, don't serve the worst possible plastic forks ever. These were miserable cutlery and the horchata was not very good at all and at $1.75, the portion size is way too small. 
   Most dishes are 8 bucks and although the menu board says croissant, you get just 1 tortilla with your entree. The pesto chicken was good, but had a bad aftertaste and the mexican rice could have been hotter. It was worth a try, but there are not enough choices here to even call this place a restaurant and the coupons on the menu are long expired. Also, Martha please don't leave your four-year old kid at a table in the corner unattended watching her DVD while you cook in the back. Very unprofessional. Tables are for customers, babysitters are for kids."}
{"text":"I have been to Martha's twice now, and have tried the green chili carnitas, the pesto chicken burrito, as well as the homemade horchata. The food is excellent, the portions are generous, and the service is as friendly as can be. I look forward to frequenting this new restaurant and making my way through all of the items on the menu, as I have found each to be outstanding so far."}
{"text":"Marthas Kitchen was way more than expected. When you first pull up the outside looks questionable but this is def a case where you dont judge a book by its cover. We were immediately greeted by Martha who went over the menu with us. Our food was absolutely delicious (and i am quite picky with my mexican food). The ceviche was soooo good and flavorful. Martha stopped by the table to see how we were doing and to chat, she is such a friendly and pleasant person. If you are looking for REAL home cooked mexican, a cozy atmosphere and a wonderful host then Marthas Kitchen is the place!! We will definitely be coming back! PS dont be afraid of the red \"shot\" that comes with the ceviche, it is clamato juice that is by far the best tasting thing!"}
{"text":"Excellent homemade style Mexican food! Reminds me of being back home with my mom. I had the Birria bowl which came with beans and rice and my wife had the quinoa salad. The portions were large. Martha was very polite and sweet! I'll be coming back for lunch soon"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food! Martha's is a small converted restaurant with huge tastes. The Jamaica sweet tea was rich and delicious. The Barbacoa quesadilla was fantastic! Full of clean choice meat and cheese with a side of rice and beans. You can have veggie s if you like.  My husband had the green chile carnitas which he said was excellent. Perfect place for a homemade meal."}
{"text":"Had to check this place out 5 stars is rare. We arrived at about 4 On Friday, yay we are the only ones here. I assume the owner greeted us. She is super friendly & the only employee so far. Only open 5 weeks she said. Very limited menu & WHAT NO CARNE ASADa????We ordered the barbacoa torta & green chile carnitas plate. I wanted to love the food because of the 5 stars. Barbacoa was ok NOT authentic at all. Bread was great. Carnitas were ok, a lot on the no flavor,or heat side, rice..bland & soggy.  We didn't taste the homemade horchata or jicama. The quesadillas did look good & maybe will try them if we go back. I want to support ALL local businesses!! Want them to succeed especially Mexican food because it's so hard to find, honestly so I don't have to cook it myself. I will go back once it's more established. I really want this place to be a hit!! 3 stars are for Martha & her bubbling personality. Wishing her the best."}
{"text":"Real Mexican food. Great service. Feels like you are eating in her kitchen.  It is worth the trip.  Portion are not large but the quality is great."}
{"text":"I had the vegan burrito and the strawberries and cream dessert...both were so delicious! Also, Martha is so friendly and definitely cares about making great food for her customers. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It's not a five star.  I was outside and the proprietor saw me, I then walked in as she turned about and went deep into her kitchen and I was left alone for about four minutes.  But even then it would be tough to get five stars with plastic silverware and plates...which is not a bad thing.  I don't need you to dress up grandmas kitchen, grandmas kitchen just is not fine dining.  

I chose to order the Chile Verde with rice and vegetables (the beans were out!) and a horchata.  The proprietor was a very nice woman and brought my food out to me after dealing with a to go order for another gentleman.  The Chile Verde tasted awesome until about halfway through when I could taste the salt rather than the kick, less salt, add a few more Anaheims!  Rice and vegetables were solid.  

For something brand new, and just fresh-authentic Mexican Food, not too bad at all."}
{"text":"My family comes from Mexico. I completed a study-abroad college semester in Mexico. Having eaten authentic Mexican food my whole life, I refuse to go out for Mexican food.  But when I saw Martha's place, it reminded me of a distant memory--sitting with my grandfather while he did business in Spanish and us kids were kept occupied with a plate full of the best food! Those places were the best and so was Martha's. 

I'm picky about my barbacoa and my sopa.  I'm also picky about the way some cooks use cilantro. Martha's rice was perfect. Her beans were home made, the barbacoa was so flavorful and the cilantro chicken dish was seasoned so well, I forgot I was eating cilantro. Her cooking exceeded my expectations and my family will begin flooding her place. 

My grandfather passed, at 101, and my grandmother at 92, both within the last two years. This place brought me back to a time that was very sentimental, while eating amazing food. Thank you, Martha! We will be back. Often."}
{"text":"Barbacoa quesadillas were excellent. Happy to support a local restaurant that serves great food."}
{"text":"Just stopped for a quick bite on my way to Lowe's. I didn't expect to be blown away! But I have to say that this place is INCREDIBLE! I will definitely be back here over and over again! Martha is very sweet and extremely passionate about her food, you can definitely taste the difference and tell that she cares a lot! 

For desert we had a piece of her homemade Flan. This is hands down the best Flan I've ever tasted. 

Stop by and show Martha some support, because we need restaurants like this around. And for goodness sake TRY THE FLAN!!"}
{"text":"What a great find!  The menu items are limited - just 3 main dishes.  You can order as an entree, burrito or bowl, but I would suggest you order 3 tacos, one of each kind. They were delicious!  Loved the homemade beans.  Try the horchata too, not too sweet and just the right amount of cinnamon."}
{"text":"Great Authentic Mexican.  Quaint location.  Very friendly staff...it's like Mom is cooking for you.  :)"}
{"text":"Always in search of delicious, authentic,Mexican food. Eureka! I found Gold! Martha's Kitchen was cute and simple, but more importantly, it was extremely clean!!  I ordered the pork chili verde, WOW! It was delicious! Going back again. I'm getting the cream chicken this time, and pork chili verde to go!"}
{"text":"Martha's kitchen, you made my day! Loved my half chicken/half barbacoa bowl! So this is how this new place works: choose one of Martha's three main meats: cilantro-pesto chicken, barbacoa (stewed shredded beef), and green chili carnitas. You can have them on a plate, bowl, or burrito with beans and rice. There's also options for quesadilla and tortas, too. But this ain't no Chipotle (in a good way). Martha does a really excellent job making these meats. You can tell they are homemade, and that she puts a lot of work into making them taste really, really good.  I'll be back to try the posole and menudo they have on the weekends. So excited for this little Mexican gem!"}
{"text":"If you want homemade Mexican food, go here!  The owner is awesome, my father and I spoke to her for a while. The barbacoa is awesome! The corn tortillas, veggies and rice that I had with it were perfect. If you need anything, just ask Martha! My father had the green Chile pork and loved it. This isn't chain style, cheap american-mexican food. It is a humble restaurant but the food is what it's all about! Give it a try."}
{"text":"Great food! So happy I stopped by one afternoon after work. Martha's is my new go to for Mexican!"}
{"text":"I can't go back. The store smells strongly of cleaning &/or bathroom chemicals. My husband did really like his food but I didn't like my food at all. My burrito had balsamic vinegar in it which was just weird and kind of yucky. No chips. Salsa and pico didn't have appealing flavors either."}
{"text":"We might have gone in at a bad time before they were closing. They were cleaning the floors so it kinda stunk while we were eating with the front door open. The lady.. I assume \"Martha\" was super nice and explained how the menu worked and explained the few of the dishes she had. The sauces were really good in these dishes. Barbacoa was pretty good also. Except the chicken in the dishes were dry since they were white meat. It felt like they were made earlier in the day and left there to be mixed with the sauces when people ordered them. I give credit where the sauces taste like home cooking. The dishes were served on styrofoam plates which made the food get cold faster. I think this restaurant can be perfected and will improve overtime."}
{"text":"The best barbacoa I've ever had! Clean restaurant, kind service. A nice value for the money."}
{"text":"Not to many Mexican restaurants deliver and found this on yelp.  We had the Baracoa quesadilla recommend by the gentleman on the phone who took our order.  It was outstanding moist juicy and cheesy, beef melted in your mouth. 

They included beef juice for dipping and little containers of lime with onions and cilantro with the order.  Can't rave enough.  We also order 2 tacos yummy.  Only con would be the hot sauce is not hot enough, however the food was so flavorful still gave them 5 stars."}
{"text":"What a great little spot! Tacos were delicious! Full of flavor and the meat was plenty juicy! Had the cheese enchiladas which missed the mark but not enough to take from the tacos and great service. Martha was running the front and what a wonderful personality she has!  We will absolutely be back to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"OMG, I know don't have to look to hard to find Mexican food in Mesa, AZ. But I always have to try a restaurant with 4.5 stars. This place is definitely worth every star that I and others have given to them. We met Martha the owner and it was if we had been friends for years. Then the food came out, the flavor of their authentic mexican recipes was to die for. If you like Mexican food, drive, walk, ride your bike just get here. You'll love it!"}
{"text":"Aaaaahhhhmazing great veggie bowl and the green chili carnitas were top shelf!!! Oh and Martha is incredible and you can tell she makes everything with love!!!!"}
{"text":"Tiny little place with amazing Mexican food! Martha is a sweetheart and you can tell she is proud of her food. I had the full meal plate with two carnitas tacos and one barbacoa enchilada. The sauces are amazing and flavorful."}
{"text":"This is a little gem of a place. You feel like you went to your sister's for dinner. Very tasty food and attentive service. Martha is a doll!"}
{"text":"Stopped here after seeing Yelp reviews and were not disappointed. Three adults and 2 picky kids and all were happy. Each of the meat entrees were delicious- the barbacoa, the carnitas and the chicken (with cilantro pesto) were all very good. Beans were a hit too. Creamy and delish. The Jamaica tea is really good and not too sweet. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"The service was great, but the food was not. I ordered a bowl with green chili carnitas, beans, vegetables, and pico de gallo to go. The bowl came with rice instead of the vegetables I ordered and the whole thing was very bland and it felt like I was eating a stew, not a burrito bowl. It was over priced too... I could he gone to Chipotle and paid less. But like I said, the service was great. I think this restaurant could do well if they spiced their food up a bit."}
{"text":"Don't let the humble storefront scare you off. Really delicious food lives here! And seriously, I arrived and the woman at the counter spoke no English so she called the owner and the owner interpreted for me. It was so worth the extra effort! I had the cilantro cream chicken in a taco. Fabulous!! The Pico is spicy but still flavorful...not just HOT. The owner arrived and made sure my order was correct. She takes great pride in her work. I will always support places like this. Thank you for a delicious lunch!!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding, fast, and friendly. The care and dedication of the proprietor shine through in the food. Best posole I've had in some time!"}
{"text":"Pretty darn good. They have a very small menu, but I have a feeling every item on it is delicious.

I ended up getting a burrito with shredded beef and it was quite good."}
{"text":"We ate dinner here the other night and got the chance to meet Martha, the owner and chef, who was so sweet. She gave a very good introduction to the menu, and she offered recommendations that did not disappoint. I had the green chili pork and it was mouth-watering delicious. Her rice and beans were very authentic which I appreciate. Our vegetarian friend got a delicious quinoa bowl with fresh vegetables. I highly recommend this place if you're looking for authentic Mexican food and pleasant service. I live 30 minutes away but will make a point to eat there again."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food. Greta service. Great atmosphere. Although, I don't eat put much, I would go back there again."}
{"text":"When I see a newer place on Yelp with such a high rating, I gotta go!  Totally worth it.  The decor is like you are entering someone's home which is appropriate as the food is very authentic and homey.  This restaurant is following the newer trend of higher quality without the need for a server/tip.  Nice.  I was served immediately and did not wait long at all for my meal.  Martha took time to have conversation with me and was very welcoming.  Ordered the chicken with cilantro cream, rice and beans.  High quality chicken white meat (I am partial to white but also like dark.) Yummy. All for under $10 including my drink.  They have a nice selection of bottle hot sauces including some of my faves.  I understand that they cater, as well!  Give 'em a try!"}
{"text":"I am so glad this place is right down the street from my work. Now I have an excuse to come here on my lunch more often. The owner I believe is named Martha, and she is such a sweetheart & remarkable host. I walked into a quaint, subtle little spot with cute decor that makes you feel like you're in grandmas, or as I call her \"Nana\"'s Kitchen.. so many good choices off the menu I couldn't decide. Martha recommend the the Barbacoa Quesadilla and I was so impressed when I tasted it. I finished every bite, plus the rice & beans. I could've licked my plate clean! I ordered the horchata for a drink, and that too was homemade and DELICIOUS! Good horchata is a hit or miss at some places, but here it was a HIT. I will be returning back to try the other menu items. It's a great Mexican food restaurant I highly recommend to anyone who loves good old homemade-feel-type Mexican food!"}
{"text":"A very small but tasty owner -operator run Mexican kitchen. I tried the carnitas and it was stellar. Also, there are very few places that make homemade horchata- and this is one of them. The meal was excellent, the service kind and the prices reasonable. Very glad to have them newly in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for a quick dinner after receiving a yelp notification it was in the area and had good reviews.  

Martha greeted us when we entered the restaurant and asked if it was our first time there and then explained the menu to us.  She's very helpful and very customer service focused which I appreciate!  Though the menu is small she offers a variety of ways to order (Burrito, Bowl, or Plate) and that is great for someone like me who sticks to a low carb diet.  

My husband and I ended up having the Cilantro Lime Pesto Cream Chicken Plate with refried beans and rice as sides.  The meal was great and very flavorful!  The chicken was all breast meat and nice quality and the Pesto sauce was yummy! The beans were really flavorful and had good texture to them.  I didn't try the rice but my husband said it tasted great.  The meal came with two pieces of Telera bread which my husband happily scarfed down with the Pesto sauce.  I definitely can't wait to go back and try the Barbacoa and Carnitas!"}
{"text":"They have the best barbacoa quesadilla, you have to try it, it's delicious!!  Their flour tortilla is amazing and the horchata was just perfect! 
It's a family owned restaurant and very clean place."}
{"text":"This place is really good.  They have three base items  - barbacoa, green chili pork carnitas and pesto cream chicken - that they use to  make burros, tacos, enchiladas, etc..

I had the three taco plate (2 carnitas and 1 barbacoa) which came with rice and beans. Everything was delicious and the bill was less than $9.

To top it off, Martha was delightful."}
{"text":"Well it was 11am and wanted eggs. But no ! Not at this place. Only 4 different plates 3 different ways.
My plate was salty and the beans were runy.but the rice was great. The only plus. I ask 4 a glass of
Water and got a bottle from Costco? Wow.do 2 the fact they only had can soda . both my plate and my
Friends plate had a bunch of liquid at the end and we didn't order soup. The place was clean but will
Not go back."}
{"text":"Authentic,very tasty food. Marta was behind the counter and very friendly. Fresh food and nice portions. Check it out."}
{"text":"As other reviewers have noted, the menu really is limited to a very few items. Basically three-- pork, chicken, and beef options, each available served three ways. You can opt for a plate, bowl, or burrito. We ordered one barbacoa and one carnitas. I requested plates, but it appeared we got bowls, which was a non- issue. I think the plate is for folks who don't like their foods commingled. Sides we selected were rice and beans. The beans were very tasty homemade refries. Just delicious. Rice was the usual. Both the barbacoa and carnitas were tasty and generously served. Fresh tortillas accompanied the bowls. The house made fresh horchata was yummy if you like that watery rice pudding taste, which my husband does. Our to-go order was ready when I arrived and the counter person was nice. The decor is sparse. It's not a slick chain restaurant, which is great. The best part of the meal was the flan. It's dense, sweet, but not too sweet, and has a little bit of lovely caramel jus. Best we have ever had, and a nice fat wedge of it."}
{"text":"This is some of the best Mexican food I've had in quite some time , the barbacoa beef and  green chile carnitas are both fantastic!
 I love that the husband and wife do everything from cooking to cleaning up and am happy to help support their excellent restaurant!
A great little place to put into our rotation!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible. Located in the East Valley (Phoenix), unbelievable authentic Mexican food. Maybe the best I've had in all of Arizona. Mexican place with great food and great local ownership!

Martha makes and serves all the food! She's awesome!"}
{"text":"Good good at a good price. Martha was there and very kind.

I don't understand why a lot if Mexican food restaurants serve soda in a can....i need a refill!"}
{"text":"We were looking for something new to try while we were in the area.   We saw that Martha's Kitchen had 5-Stars and only 1-Dollar sign, so we had to try it.  I felt obligated since I don't think I've ever even seen a 5-Star 1-Dollar restaurant before.

As we pulled-up, we saw that the restaurant is literally in the same building as the gas station convenience store...so I KNEW it was going to be great.  I loved hole in the wall dining in NJ. 

There isn't table service, you order at the counter.  It seems to be a husband and wife team that owns this restaurant. The husband was incredibly nice and explained the menu very well. During our meal, Martha herself came to our table and asked if everything was good. 

I tried the Cilantro, Pesto, and Chicken Burrito.  It was a delicious Italian-Mexican fusion. My wife had the barbacoa burrito and our daughter had a kids quesadilla. She also got a strawberry parfait, which I actually thought was a drink when I initially paid for it.  It was fantastic!  Martha told me that she will be making different versions of it and she suggested that I follow the restaurant on Facebook.  https://www.facebook.com/Marthas-Kitchen-218346331927129/?ref=br_rs

This place is a jewel.  There isn't silverware, soda fountains or table service...but for me the low price, great food and pleasant attitudes make up for it.  We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"That's the best Barbacoa I ever had in me whole life! I think I could eat 3 Barbacoa plates till I explode from awesomness, the quinoa salad was very good, the lentil chicken soup was also very good, the Jamaica was epic, coming back tomorrow for Friday ceviche!"}
{"text":"Truly authentic homemade Mexican food. So glad we found this little restaurant. The carnitas and Barbacoa were definitely some of the best I have had in a long while! Reminds me of my nana's cooking."}
{"text":"This is one of the best authentic Mexican restaurants I've ever had. My boyfriend and I absolutely loved it!!! I will definitely be making this a weekly place of mine. Soooooo good!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy food and wonderful service. She was extremely sweet and helpful. Will visit again. Definitely get chips and salsa!"}
{"text":"I don't know where to start, but I'll start by mentioning that I am from Tucson where all the good mexican food is so it is HARD (been looking for three years)  to find an even DECENT Mexican restaurant in the valley UNTIL I found Martha's Kitchen! Her food is DELICIOUS! I've had her barcaboa tacos, burritos, and quesadilla and I'm never disappointed!  I read some of her reviews that it was \"pricey\" but I think it's bogus considering the amount of food you get, not to mention the quality and taste of it. Oh and yes she uses paper plates to serve in but I didn't realize that was ever an issue at a \"whole in the wall place\". Just come and eat, enjoy your food and throw away your place. Lol. Simple as that. I unfortunately have been on a diet so I haven't been in for a couple of months but everyone please enjoy her food and think of me while you eat it! Hahaha"}
