{"text":"I come here at least once a week. Good, chill vibes in this spot. Sometimes I bring a friend so I can beat them at chess. There's a chess board there. The coffee is great. The vegan cookies are clutch. Fantastic place to grab a cup and kill some time."}
{"text":"My first visit here exceeded expectations, with service, conversation, and great human interaction.   The cafe is a perfect place to come enjoy coffee, grab a quick bite to eat, relax, or finish work (they do have free wifi and plenty of seating both inside and outside).   While here I enjoyed coffee and a chocolate chip cookie. The coffee is made with care me the baristas are truly accomplished. The prices are extremely reasonable and quality is above par.   It was great to find Livelihood, which is in the heart of Kensington. It's an open place and very warm and welcoming. They also have games like chess and Jenga.   Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"I've nothing but good to say about Livelihood Cafe.  This business was started to help newcomers to Canada get a start with a business in Kensington. Even though you'd think this is typical for the market with its long history of providing immigrants a spot to get a foothold, lately we have seen the likes of Jen Agg (The Black Hoof) step in to take a bite of the lucrative pie here with the huge popularity of what is becoming a bona fide tourist trap. Livelihood leapfrogs over all that, bringing some fantastic middle eastern style and panache to a cute yet spacious cafe, where other businesses have recently failed. It's not easy to survive on Pedestrian Sundays alone, and the foot traffic is lighter than you'd think at off peak hours.  When you visit, be sure to try the Syrian tea. They make it in a large cauldron and it sits there, steaming, exuding exotic aromas, steeping gently. It's quite tasty and goes well with their flatbread. There are other treats, many made with almond and other nuts like walnuts. When I stopped in for tea at around 10am it was very quiet, with no obnoxious canned music playing; just a nice sunny view of Augusta, which made for a serene place to reflect, or to work without much distraction. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The people was welcoming. I drank a hot chai latte and it was very delicious! Smooth and unsweetened as I like, with a nice taste of cinnamon. Nice place to spend time."}
{"text":"Friendly customer service and quality coffee. Open and bright space and employees Syrian refugees. Great cause!!"}
{"text":"What a lovely spot in Kensington Market - if I lived downtown I would definitely come by this area more often. The space is warm and welcoming with a variety and plentiful seating. Tried a Turkish coffee (which is like a spiced espresso to me) and similar in size to a Syrian tea I had earlier in the week. I would definitely love to come back in the summer and try the Lavender lemonade and the Almond ice cream - both sound delicious! Will definitely be back! :)"}
{"text":"Nice cafe to sit and study or work in for a few hours. The coffee was also really good! My Americano was hot and strong. Liked that the cafe helps employ newcomers to Canada! Definitely would come back!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite coffee shops ever. It's so relaxed and feels like home. The employees are kind and the beverages are always good. The lavender lemonade was an incredible addition to the menu and the Syrian tea is a favourite."}
{"text":"One of the few warm coffeeshops in the winter. I'm from California and hate having my choice time fully dressed. Locals, however, don't seem to mind sitting in their parkas.  This place is cozy with friendly staff where you have a great lattes without shivering :)"}
{"text":"Fresh brewed amazing Turkish coffee for $3!!! Really loved the vibe and it's even more awesome that they pay their employees well and help them integrate into Canadian society. I wish this was there in my hometown"}
{"text":"Nice addition to Kensington market. Unfortunately only 1 employee, slowwwww.  Too long for a coffee.  Nice interior."}
{"text":"The concept of the business is good, but please train your employees how to make coffee correctly, the milk frothing was off."}
{"text":"Absolutely love that it's Syrian refugee run. It's so so lovely to see refugees integrating into our communities while also maintaining their culture. The hummus is to die for and the staff are lovely. Ever since they took it over, the atmosphere has been above and beyond. Even so, if I could recommend one thing it would be to not have top 50 pop songs as their main playlist. As many people are studying or relaxing, it may be beneficial to have some music that is more in tune with that kind of vibe."}
{"text":"If you are like me and can't function without coffee, then you will be impressed with all of the coffee locals Toronto's Kensington Market offers. But this gem shines among the rest.  The cortado I had here was better than the 7+ places I went to before. And that is just the coffee. The purpose of this café is to assist recent refugees integrate into Toronto's workforce through training. But as all great ideas, it is a give and take. This café offers treats from around the world like their delicious hummus, lavender lemonade, or almond ice cream and you can see the pride that is taken in making these items.    The service, the food, and the people make this one of my favorite places in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Walking by and looked for the first place that had coffee. Livelihood had the sign \"Coffee\" and a picture of a blue bird in the window. Works for me. The place turns out to be a non profit. Coffee with a purpose. We had a couple americanos which were good. The place is great to work in. It's very airy, there are a few electrical outlets and WiFi is pretty good (14/3). I'll be coming here often to grab a coffee and do some work. Recommended"}
{"text":"Relaxed atmosphere, tasty food and coffee. Really nice people run this cafe, working on a good cause. Wish I could make time to come here more!"}
{"text":"Really great cafe in the Kensington Market neighborhood. Loved that it's a not for profit run cafe by Syrian refugees! The coffee was delicious and the staff working were so so SO friendly. Highly recommend. Especially if you're looking for a slow paced, bright, happy spot to work and read. Lots of great seating. Bring a game, a book or a friend and join the cause!"}
{"text":"Livelihood Cafe is part of a non-profit organization called the Livelihood Project. This organization help refugees develop transferable work skills and re-train people who have lost their jobs to automation. Livelihood Project also teaches digital skills to help people familiarize themselves with the constant changes in the digital world. They hire refugees from Syria, Ethiopia, Sudan, and Somalia to work at Livelihood Cafe. However, they are not just hiring people who are looking for a job. The organization is currently looking for the next leaders to guide their own communities in the future. Livelihood Project aims to give these refugees experience and knowledge to empower others. They want people who are passionate and inspired to make changes within the Toronto refugee community.  The Livelihood Cafe itself is located in the middle of Kensington Market. It acts as a training and meeting space for the public and headquarter for the organization's operations. It allows other non-profit organizations to come and work at the cafe as well. This is also a good space with WiFi to get your own work done if you live within the area.  If you are someone from Syria, Ethiopia, Sudan or Somalia that makes traditional baked goods from your home country, Livelihood Cafe is interested in selling your treats. If you would like to reach out to them, please visit their website."}
{"text":"Love their almond ice cream!  I belive the ice cream is homemade. You can taste the almond flavor with the flakes inside the oce cream.   Love the environment here. Its so spacious with high tables, benches and tables."}
{"text":"Currently sitting here sipping on my Americano. Really enjoying this cozy cafe..it has a warm and inviting feel and was a plus that it is actually a nonprofit run by refugees. A really nice place to sit and study at as its quite spacious with lots of tables and free wifi. Would come back!"}
{"text":"The most amazing cafe ran by Syrian refugees, what a way to give back Toronto!   Food: - best thing ever: Syrian breakfast. It consists of spice bread, fig jelly, cucumber and tomatoes mint salad, feta cheese, olives. My friend liked it so much he got it for breakfast AND lunch while we were there! The eggplant hummus is also great.   Drinks: - Cortado was quite interesting. It's bigger and sweeter than most but worth it!  - the Syrian tea is quite interesting, it's refreshing, spicey and has walnuts inside! I definitely recommend trying :)   Free samples: They actually have a dish of free baked goods for you to try. They are actually delicious! Wish the original baked goods were still available so I can buy some!   Lots of seating and great place to catch up with a friend or even get some studying done!"}
{"text":"The drip coffee was quite good. The people were quite friendly and helpful. The atmosphere is a stark yet homey with plenty of light. It was an inviting place to hangout and work."}
{"text":"Great coffee and location. We had the eggplant and humus dips and both were outstanding.  I would definitely return foe the excellent coffee."}
{"text":"Was pretty upset spending money here. Wouldn't come here again given the experience I had when I went. Might have just been the person that was making my drink. I had a mocha, which was served in a small 8oz water glass with steamed chocolate milk(?!)and the barista didn't have a clue how to pull the shot or steam the milk. Don't go here if you're looking for quality. Great seating area though."}
