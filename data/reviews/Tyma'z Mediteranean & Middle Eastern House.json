{"text":"Hey, it is nowhere and does not look like much on the outside, sometimes not many people there but WHOOOOO a lot of folks are missing this excellent middle eastern food.  I have tried it all, even the fish which could be to spicy for most but not me.  The lamb is as good as you will ever get.  I am a repeat customer, many times, very reasonable

{"text":"Probably the best Middle Eastern restaurant in Pittsburgh. Everything tastes fresh and flavorfull."}
{"text":"hot damn! I left this place announcing it as one of the best meals I've had in the burgh and I think it still is. There are some great middle eastern places nearby so I was reluctant to make that 20 minute drive but it's the Udipi of middle eastern food! (It's in the middle of nowhere, across the street from a gas station)... Once inside, I gorged myself on some of the most perfectly prepared dishes. Oh the baba! Oh the kibee! I'll be back Tyma'z!"}
{"text":"I went to Tyma'z on the recommendation of Yelpers, and was really not as impressed as I wanted to be.  When we arrived at a perfectly appropriate dinner time of 6:45pm, there was literally no one else there.  We were suspicious, but ventured on.  More diners did eventually show up when we were halfway through our meal.

I had the vegetarian moussaka ($13), which was very freshly made and piping hot.  The flavor was not as good as I'd hoped.  I thought the tomato sauce should have more of a spice (cardamom, something like that?) to it, but my dish really tasted like veggie lasagna minus the noodles.  My dining companion had the beef shawarma ($17), which had a better flavor than my dish, but sort of looked like Steak-Umms.  I'm still hopeful that it wasn't, but it could have been ... The rice pilaf side and the hummus and pita that came out before our meal were both very good.

Overall, the meal was fine, but it wasn't as good as it should have been for the price.  Staff was nice and attentive.  It's one of those places that I'm glad I tried, but I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"On business travel and was looking for a restaurant to try.  I was pleasantly suprised by Tyma'z.  It was a quaint restaurant with good food.  If I stay in the same area for my next visit, I'll most likely head there again."}
{"text":"We went there for the firs time tonight. We had the large appetizer platter. I was a big fan of the feta, olives, grape leaves, hummus, and tabbouleh. I wasn't a big fan of the baba ganouj. We split the beef shwarma and lamb gyro. It was all very fresh and tasty. I liked it!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Middle Eastern restaurants.  A little out of the way, but definitely worth the trip.  The food tastes fresh and homemade."}
{"text":"A cozy, friendly little place to get good Middle Eastern food. Everything tasted like love. Lemon juice-covered, parsley-powered love. 

I don't think I've ever had creamier babaganoush in all my days. My Pa and I ordered up the large sampler platter which included the babaganoush, hummus, feta, olives, tabouleh and grape leaves. This was enough to fill us quite well so we split a single entree from there. The baked kibee is now on my list of go-to comfort foods. I'm not sure of the exact recipe but it tasted like beef, cinnamon, almonds and love. 

We wrapped up the night with nutty, flaky, chewy baklava. And then ordered some more tabouleh to go."}
{"text":"We hadn't been to Tyma'z for a few months and just went back last week. They've recently renovated the restaurant and updated their menu. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"This place is really great, waaay off the beaten path, but worth it.  Their baba and hummus are AMAZING...  Definitely order the combination appetizer."}
{"text":"As I drove by Tyma'z yesterday, I counted 15 (yes 15!!!!) cars outside.  YAY!!!  I'm glad that this is becoming more of an \"it\" spot.... This restaurant is way to good to do poor business!"}
{"text":"Tyma'z is one of the best Middle Eastern restaurants in Pittsburgh that no one has ever heard of.  Unfortunately, I never got the chance to eat there while living in the 'Burgh, but my mother took me last year when I visited, and again over the summer.

The little family-owned joint is tucked away in a residential area of the North Hills, across from a cake decorating shop and not much else.  As other reviewers have pointed out, the restaurant can be hard to find since the exterior isn't flashy and the parking lot is tiny.  Anyway, the interior is cozy and the entire staff are attentive and accommodating.  The menu has a nice array of traditional Syrian food and other Middle Eastern treats.

Order one of the appetizer platters for a great selection of foods like grape leaves, falafel, tabbouli, and hummus with pita.  The grape leaves are to die for and the hummus is delicious!  I've had the Sleek (kale, black eyed peas, and cracked wheat) and Shish Tawook (lemon mint chicken) and both were out of this world.  If you're craving really authentic, unique Middle Eastern food, definitely make a trip out to Tyma'z!

Bonus: They have plenty on the menu for vegetarians!"}
{"text":"Western Pennsylvania has long been known for its Syrian restaurants, especially in Pittsburgh and New Castle. Tyma'z is a quick hop off of I-279, so it's very accessible, despite being out in the suburbs a bit.

The experience wasn't quite five-star in my book, but very, very good. 

The hummus is excellent, though not better than the Gypsy Cafe's. One small disappointment for me is that they served it with the thin type of pita. I prefer thick, bready pitas, like those served by Mary's Restaurant & Bakery in New Castle.

I had the shish kabab (lamb) dinner. The lamb was great, and the rice pilaf, which is topped with toasted almonds, was also particularly good.

Overall, I would definitely return here. If eastern mediterranean food is your thing, I would still recommend the Gypsy Cafe over Tyma'z, but if you live on the north side of town, Tyma'z is a more convenient- and still very solid- choice. It's more authentically Syrian, to boot. (Gypsy Cafe is more of a mixed/fusion kind of place, with a constantly changing menu.)"}
{"text":"This restaurant is really out in the middle of nowhere.  I seriously thought the GPS had goofed.

Once inside the staff is friendly and attentive.  We were welcomed with a free sample of humus which was pretty amazing.  So good that we ended up ordering a full plate of the humus.  

For the entrees we had the chicken tawook and falafel (vegan) with side salads.  The chicken was good but I wish they would have cooked it two more minutes so it could have had a better texture while being juicy.  The seasoning was good tho.  The falafel was alright.

We left too stuffed to try the dessert.  I'd recommend this place if you live somewhere in the vicinity.  I don't think i'd come back since I live in Squirrel Hill.

P.S. Lots of vegan/vegetarian options here.  There's a vegetarian section in the menu which can easily be made vegan."}
