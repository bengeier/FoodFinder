{"text":"Traveling in Mississauga, went to Sushi Park upon yelp recommendation. This is definitely far from the best sushi I've ever had. Tuna is not of the best quality, there're tendons that are chewy; scallops are frozen with watery taste; salmon is farmed quality salmon.

Over all it was a fair meal, if you're just craving sushi, thus the 3 star."}
{"text":"Sushi Park is a tiny little takeout place, nestled in Woodchester Plaza.  But don't let its humble exterior deceive you - this place is without a doubt the gold standard that I hold every new sushi place I go to against.  In terms of taste-freshness-price ratio, no other sushi place that I've been to in the GTA has them beat.

I've been coming to this place ever since the current (super adorable!) owners took over, and I have NEVER been disappointed!

Their handrolls are absolutely unbeatable.  I like the spicy salmon and LOVE the dynamite!  Crispy, fresh seaweed, generous portions of fish and just the right amount of rice...these things will convert your sushi-hating friends into sushi fanatics! I know that sounds like an exaggeration, but I'm speaking from personal experience! AND they're 2 for $5.50 - are you kidding me?! Any other place I've been to would only give you ONE for that price!

Their big takeout platters are superb quality and have a wonderful variety, but I must admit that I don't often order these (from here or anywhere else).  But the odd time that I've pulled one of these out to a party, the entire platter is wiped clean in minutes.

For lunch, my go-to item is the Maki Set B - 8pcs Kamikaze (spicy salmon/avocado/cucumber), 8pcs Dynamite, soup and salad for just about ten bucks. They always tell me it'll be ready in 15 minutes, but I get there in half that time and it's already waiting for me!  Then I get so excited that I'm throwing maki rolls in my face on the drive back to work, and before I know it I've polished off all 16 rolls in 5 minutes flat because they're that god damned delicious. Er, I've said too much.

While their standard sushi rolls are superb quality, the fun thing about this restaurant is their Special Rolls - exotic, fanciful twists on sushi, some of which are unique to this place.  I'm a regular eater of the Rainbow Dragon, Mango Dragon, Spicy Crunch Salmon, and Calamari rolls.

Their Kalbi dinner is also very good.

To top it all off, the owners, Hannah and Young Man, are some of the sweetest people I've ever met. They always remember you, and always greet you with warm, sincere smiles.  Try sitting in some time - they like to give their regulars free treats here and there. :)"}
{"text":"Great spot for take out. I've ordered small party trays on several occasions and have never been disappointed. Only discovered this place from my brother in law a few months ago. We've been ordering from here ever since and glad there it's close by."}
{"text":"An incredible sushi place! The sushi and sashimi are fresh and delicious. I usually get the maki set C which has 8 California rolls, 8 dynamite rolls, miso soup and salad for roughly 10$!!! I usually pre order on the phone and pick it up for more convenience! Great deal for sure."}
{"text":"The best sushi take out or dine in. Try the spicy bulgugi it's to die for I always ask for extra rice, maki set B and my sons favorite the calamari roll."}
{"text":"The special rolls are more delicious than any rolls I've had in Toronto, and yet priced better, too. It is a tiny place, but my friend and I ate in by the window; we were both very happy with the food, and the calm, courteous service by the owners. 

Would definitely go here again. Wouldn't have found the place were it not for customer feedback sites like yelp. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I came here based on the high reviews and am very impressed. The sushi was by far the best i've ever had. I like the fact that the sushi is made fresh while waiting. i will definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"I love getting take out from this place. It's well priced and the sushi is fresh and made to order. Great alternative to all those AYCE places that have recently gone downhill and more expensive."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. Hands down the best sushi takeout for miles radius. Nothing competes. 
Get the spicy tuna roll,spicy salmon roll and a dragon roll for 2 and be amazed. The owners r super nice and get to know u. They're  working very hard and non stop and doing well. Boy I would like to know where that tuna was coming from!!"}
{"text":"Great sushi ! It's a takeout place pretty much. There are just 2-3 seats by the entrance but I get a vibe the owners prefer customers doing takeaways . Sushi is always fresh"}
{"text":"Thank you yelpers.  Good sushi for take out at reasonable prices.  It's quick and convenient.  Limited in store seating more for a solo or couple to have a quick bite.  Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"Great prices, friendly owners, great sushi & Korean dishes.
Take out is best as there's only seating for about 4."}
{"text":"I just moved in to the area and was looking for a good sushi takeout place that wasn't going to cost me an arm and a leg. This place was it. It was fresh and delicious and the people are friendly. It is tucked away in the woodchester plaza and I would have missed it if I didn't look too closely. I would definitely recommend this place and I will be back when I don't have the energy to cook!"}
{"text":"This place is everything you want in a take-out joint:
1. Good sushi 
          The fish is fresh, the rolls are well made and the place is clean.

2. Reliable quality 
          I've been to many places where good food is the luck of the draw; some days the food is good, others not so much. Sushi Park has been great everytime I've been there.

3. Reasonable prices 
          The prices are a lot better than all other sushi joints in the area. (not considering all you can eat ofcourse) You can get a full meal - 16 pcs of served rolls, miso soup and small salad for 9 bucks. 

4. Great variety
          There is something for everybody. My coworkers who are vegetarians, intolerant to gluten or just usually picky eaters all find something they like here

Overall its a great spot you should at least try once. Order something you know you like to start and then try their other options. Bon appetit"}
{"text":"This tiny sushi spot is tucked away in a strip mall on Dundas east of Winston Churchill at the east end of the shopping area bordering Oakville. It caught my eye walking by looking quite enticing with the attractive colours and the staff smiling and focussing on the customers who made their way into the small spot. I returned on a Friday for my lunch and realized that there was only a small table and a bar lining the window. Take out was busy and all I had was just a spot to sit at the window, which was perfect. I ordered a combo sushi/sashimi platter which was served with miso soup. The presentation was beautiful and the fish tasted fresh and flavourful. A very satisfying lunch with a generous enough portion that ruined my appetite for an early supper :) They also surprised me at the end with a nicely carved orange which had been quartered and served in half of the orange skin - neat trick."}
{"text":"Was good 1.dragon. Tamago was old.. Disappointing. Spice tuna was just weird. Otherwise we liked"}
{"text":"I love getting sushi from here, it's not as pricy but fishes are fresh! I think it's a mature couple that owns the place and they are super sweet as well!"}
{"text":"This place caters primarily to take-out as there is limited seating

It is head and shoulders the best take-out sushi you can get in Mississauga.  I live in the east end of Mississauga and I make the occasional trip out here when i feel like treating myself to a nice sushi meal.  

You cannot go wrong with anything here.  The nigiri sushi is made well and the fish has always been very fresh.  The avocado and dynamite rolls I had were excellent.  It was also made in under 10 minutes which was quite amazing considering how well the sushi was put together. Service was also friendly.

I highly recommend the Take sushi combo (just $14) which includes 12 pieces of nigiri (which you can customize to your liking - I perfer mostly salmon myself)  and an 8 piece dynamite roll.  Also includes a decent miso soup and salad."}
{"text":"I finally found a decent sushi place in Mississauga. It's a hole in the wall no frills sort of deal, they have at most 4 seats in the entire place and their business is 99% take-out. But they have some amazing sushi and at a great price. The staff is friendly and they're quick with orders. 

Just as everyone else says, the Take Sushi combo and the Combo B is great. The sushi is fresh and they can customize orders. If you're looking for sushi in sauga (and I'll admit, there really isn't that much selection here), then you should give this place a try."}
{"text":"Great quality but don't expect any bells and whistles! Try do nigiri right and focus on highlighting the fish. I do wish they gave more thought to presentation or even speciality maki rolls. They cover the basics well.. Just not great in any capacity."}
{"text":"This sushi place is great. Prices are low, and quantity and quality are high. Mom and pop shop. You can eat there but space is limited so best to order ahead and grab takeout. Owners are friendly. Food is great. Really like their spicy rolls. They gave us free miso for eating in. Will definitely be back. I'm still craving their tuna love roll."}
{"text":"Consistently delicious. Great quality food for very reasonable prices. Maki sets are my go to. Every so often we also indulge in large party sets. Definitely one of the most reliable take out places in Mississauga!"}
{"text":"Honestly, the best al la carte/take out Sushi in Mississauga. Their Sushi pizza is the best I have ever had.  Fresh grade fish, fresh everything pretty much. Not only is their sushi immaculate, their Bulgogi is succulent too. For a Moms and Pops sushi, I wouldnt expect anything but amazing service, and that is what they delivered. Sweet little gem of a place!"}
{"text":"I used to order the Maki Set C which came out to be $10, a really good price. The prices are really good at sushi park but I find the sushi only okay. It has this weird taste to it that made me not like it over time. But I'm not sure if that's just me. I would recommend trying this place for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing for affordable, on-the-run sushi AND Korean food
From bulgogi to spicy salmon roll, they offer a great variety of food without the menu being too confusing or too huge
Don't waste your time going to 168 sushi buffet nearby and just buy from here, go home, and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Hands down best sushi in Mississauga...maybe even Toronto. Found this place about 5 years ago after trying one Sushi place after another when we moved to Mississauga 6 years ago. We do sushi about twice a month and have been loyal customers since we found this gem. The amazing taste, quality and freshness is absolutely consistant time after time. The service here is always friendly and professional. Seating here is very, very limited, but do-able, however take-out is the better choice. I couldn't even begin to pick a favourite and I change it up all the time. You wont be disappointed with any selection. PS: make sure you try their Gyoza soup (Wonton soup) its to die for!"}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi that is both fresh and flavourful. Prices are reasonable and they have many options for combos and platters for variety. Miso soup isn't overly salty which I appreciate. The service is very quick and while the place mostly does takeout and catering, there is a bit of room to sit and eat if you just can't wait until you get home! Wonderful place 10/10 would come back over and over again. I only wish I had heard about it sooner!"}
{"text":"Our Friday night go to for the past six months. Fantastic, fresh and reasonably priced. A great hidden gem for those on the hunt for decent sushi in the west end. Only caveat, it is strictly takeaway."}
{"text":"Sushi Park. Small family business and their food MEANS BUSINESS!! very tasty sushi. However was sauced up to the max. We tried the white dragon, maybe that style of sushi is sauced up. 
Also had calamari. Tasted good. Nothing extraordinary. Overall very good place! :)"}
{"text":"Based on all the amazing Yelp reviews, I went to try this place out.  It's a clean, very small joint with 4-5 stools.  

My likes:
-rolls are cheap (they have 8 PC rolls for less than $6)
-fish is fresh
-the hot sauce that comes with the Sashimi Donburi appears to be homemade


Dislikes:
-There was too much spicy mayo on top of the spicy dynamite roll and it wasn't that spicy.  
-The sashimi donburi had 50% salad and 50% fish.  Maybe I'm spoiled because downtown TO has places with better value (the day before I had sashimi donburi that was 80% fish and 20% salad).

Overall: it's cheap, decent value but it wasn't worth the drive for me (20 minutes to there, 20 minutes back).  If you live closer, then it's a good safe bet."}
{"text":"Great value sushi overall, it's a great place for sushi takeout for people living close by. Will definitely visit here and I enjoy the spicy salmon roll very much!"}
{"text":"Very tiny restaurant. No tables, only had a sushi bar with 5 seats to sit inside. I had miso soup, crazy salmon rolls, white dragon rolls, 9 assorted sashimi, and seaweed salad. All of that for $45. Tasted good but I felt a bit sick after tho."}
{"text":"The sushi here is fresh and delicious, and that's all sushi needs to be. They also have a wide variety of rolls, and your favourites are most likely on the menu."}
{"text":"I normally agree with my friend Stephanie S. on many reviews but today, I must diverge.

Here is what I had today:

Dynamite role: A-

Spider role: C-    (was very poorly done, soft shell crab was fried poorly - was over done, and   
                            tasted smokey.  It tasted like it was fried in oil that was used too many times)

Tempura Shrimp: C+ (tempura was B- , but the sauce was wayyyyy off - was too thick and taste
                             was bitter and too strong)

Sea weed salad: B- (not bad, but at $5, it was bit too pricey)

Small salad: B+

The entire bill came out to $33

======================================

Verdict:  Mediocre at best.    It was surprising bc it was reviewed by people I know and trust.  I think the owners were having a bad day or something.  When I walked it, the the owner couple looked very unhappy.  Given the consistent stellar reviews from trusted reviewers in the past, I am willing to give them another try and redo the review in near future."}
{"text":"Great prices, fresh sushi and dishes. Too many to choose form when we were there so i panicked and got the chicken teriyaki with sushi. 

The in store seating was 2 chairs and it was awkward sitting there tbh. I'll be back for takeout to try their other roles and Korean dishes!"}
{"text":"Great spot, great value for what you're getting. Pretty no-frills overall. Mostly specialize in takeout, rolls aren't fancy but solid on taste. Owners seem like a sweet couple, and the prices are great. I ordered the crunchy spicy tuna, crunchy spicy salmon, avocado, and, kamikaze. Only complaint was a bit too much sauce and mayo on the crunchy rolls, but still very tasty and gigantic in size. One crunchy spicy tuna made me feel full, and I consume sushi like a top-feeding sea animal. Nothing fancy, but prices are good, consistency exceptional, food is fresh, and very high quality takeout."}
{"text":"I usually.order one of the party trays. It's good sushi for the price. I call ahead to order. It's a takeout shop with a few seats."}
{"text":"I am born to Sushi and I highly recommend this place! Why...fresh food, great service, with a smile. Make sure to ask for the spiced up items in their menu...although not authentic they taste ossum, specially if you are born with a taste  buds!!"}
{"text":"I cannot even express how much I love this place! After my injury, this has been my 'go to' for sushi and it never disappoints. Be sure to call and make an order or it may take a while if you order there. A lot of their business I would want to say is for take out since their sitting area is quite small. I personally have not tried dine-in but I am sure the food experience would be great. 
In regards to the food, I absolutely love their spicy salmon and black dragon roll. I recently discovered the Kamikazi roll which is salmon, avocado and spicy sauce which is perfect since I love avocado! Another yummy choice would be their shrimp tempura, it is just so good I order it every time. I have tried their sushi combos and they are great. Their fish to rice proportion is just right so you won't complain. 
The prices at Sushi Park is very affordable and fair. The quality is high and the service is awesome. We had stumbled in a little late once and the owner was super accommodating.  
Give it a try when you are in the area.  Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Came here based on reviews, definitely not worth it.  Sushi was just Ok. What turned me off was the service. They all look so glum and don't even smile at their customers."}
{"text":"I personally don't really like their sushi. But I don't deny the fact that they make genuine and fresh sushi. The place is tiny but you can tell the kitchen is very clean. Good for takeout."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with a friend today! The food was uber yummy, really hit the spot.

I had maki set B and she had the romance set. Everything was delicious! I wasn't the biggest fan of the dressing though (for the salad).

Overall a really frat experience, will come back again."}
{"text":"What! I've found my favourite sushi take-out spot in Mississauga. Hands down. 

Based on all the Yelp reviews, we called in on a Friday evening to order for pick-up - we weren't too hungry and just wanted to sample a small batch of their sushi first (you know, before going all out and gorging on a huge order of takeout sushi that may or may not be that great). So we ordered two rolls to try since we were in the area - the Spicy Salmon Roll and the Vegetable Tempura Roll (8 pieces under $6.00). 

Service was sweet, helpful, friendly. Our order was ready and waiting when we arrived - when they say 10 minutes, they mean it. The sushi itself was so delicious - I definitely recommend the Spicy Salmon roll. Great textures, very fresh, wonderful flavours (I love the crunch and hints of sesame throughout the roll). 

Like others have mentioned, note that seating is super limited (like 5 stools) - so unless you're a couple or eating in alone, it's probably best to order take-out. Also note that there's ample parking, as it's located in a large plaza (beside the new Terra Foodmart just east of Dundas and Winston Churchill).

For two rolls, we paid around $11.00. We will definitely be back to try out the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"From somebody who Hated sushi, you really ought to read this review. I tried sushi once a while ago from somewhere else and hated the taste of it. I came here because i really wanted it to give it another shot. Also reading all these lovely reviews made me come here to try it. 


I will say that the sushi here is fresh and made in front you. It is very tasty, and very inexpensive. For an 8 pc dynamite roll is about $7. With cucumber, masago, mayo and tempura shrimp it was heaven for my taste buds. Take in mind that is a take out spot for sushi although there is some seats if u wanna sit down and wait. As far as i can see it got packed fast while i was in there. They also do take out trays for very reasonable prices. 


If you do not like sushi or know someone who doesnt like sushi then please take them here, they will thank you later. I just finished my sushi and i am stuffed i just had to review Sushi Park right away #newsushifan"}
{"text":"Great service, reasonable prices, and good food! Served with a smile and I received my order in a timely manner. I ordered salmon sashimi, tempura, and a teriyaki combo. Combo lunches and dinner are all greatly priced!"}
{"text":"This is the best hidden gem of Mississuaga. Prices are great and the food is delicious. I've been coming here for at least 8 years and it never disappoints. 

The service is great and the people are friendly.

We had sushi plates and tempura everything was great!

Will definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"I finally got around to reviewing this place! My husband and I have gotten take out from here 2 or 3 times and we enjoyed the sushi we got from here each time. We've tried the spider roll, unagi roll, dynamite roll, calamari roll and salmon roll. All of them were great portions (about 8-10 pieces), stuffed with fresh ingredients, and overall was just great quality for what you pay for. Yelp definitely did not let us down when deciding whether to try this place! The prices are also reasonable at around $5 - $12 depending on what you order. 

They have several different types of sushi, appetizers and sides to choose from that I remember being overwhelmed at seeing their many different menus all along the walls. There's definitely something for everyone whether you're vegan, don't like raw fish in your sushi like me, or sushi lovers who eat all types. 

This small place is wedged in between several stores a few doors down from the large Terra supermarket. It can be hard to find if it's your first time coming here since it's a bit hidden and you have drive to the end of the plaza to find it. There is plenty of parking in the plaza itself but depending on the time of day, the spots in front of Sushi Park sometimes fill up fast. Not a big deal since you can just walk over from one of the other nearby spots.

We'll definitely continue coming back whenever we need a sushi fix around this area!"}
{"text":"Still feel the same way about this place, so I thought that I'd write a review to turn people onto Sushi Park.  STILL my go-to takeout for sushi!

My absolute favourite spicy rolls:  spicy salmon, kamikaze.  Good rice:fish ratio, great sauce - not too much/little, and even a bit of tempura bits for that crunchy texture.

Everything I could ask for in a takeout:  always ready upon pick up, nothing missing, accurate order, and on top of that, very reasonable prices!  Owners are friendly.

If the owners opened up a restaurant, it would most definitely do well!"}
{"text":"A sushi place deserving of it's great yelp reviews! We ordered the Maki Set B & Maki Set D. Both were very well portioned and a great value. We were stuffed and didn't even get to our salad & miso soup! The food was made quickly and tasted fresh. Even the California Roll which usually tastes like nothing special was great! Primarily for take outs but they have a few seats for dine-in. Definitely recommend and would come back :)"}
{"text":"On my first attempt, I came by on a Monday evening to learn that they're not open.

Fast forward a week later.. Here I am writing a review :) Went to the shop, it's a small place with limited seating. Ordered the Kamikaze and Dynamite sushi combo (with soup and salad) and the yam/squash tempura roll. It was more than I could eat!

Rice to filling ratio is good. Rolls are packed tight, using fresh fish/ingredients. Out of the three rolls, spicy salmon (kamikaze) and yam were the best.

Owners accommodated my request for extra ginger at no additional cost too."}
{"text":"Sushi Park is a fantastic take out sushi place but you can also choose to eat inside if you wish! 

I've ordered fairly often and tend to get various items at least once or twice a month. The quality of sushi in my opinion is excellent and the portions are great for the price! The maki sushi and sushi is delicious and tastes very fresh. Although it is not all you can eat, I rather prefer choosing two or three items knowing the quality is great and feeling satisfied than over eating at an AYCE. 

The owners are very friendly and courteous and I always feel happy supporting a local business especially. They also have gone out of their way to prepare party platters before they are even open."}
{"text":"This is the ultimate spot in Mississauga! The portions are larger than normal and for a reasonable price. Im always nervous on getting sushi take out but this actually the place for that."}
{"text":"This is a legit take out place; there's only 4 seats in this place. 
We ordered medium party tray (60pcs) and it was $48.95 which is very reasonable. The sushi was shiny = fresh.
I mean in my personal opinion, the sushi quality is just like the sushi that is served at all you can eat place, but the rice is for sure better here than the all you can eat place. 
The presentation was on point and overall, no complaints at all! I'm definitely coming back if I have a chance to do take out once again!"}
{"text":"My wife found this place and based on the positive Yelp reviews we decided to try it, and I'm so glad we did! From the time we got there until we left there was a nonstop flow of people picking up food, this is a take out shop and there seemed to be a lot of regulars. The Agedashi tofu was amazing!! And one order came with 6 pieces of tofu (I'm used to 4). I ordered shiitake rolls and veg tempura rolls.. Again I got 8 pieces of each (usually get 6 other places). My wife got mango dragon rolls and was raving about them! We were full and satisfied with lots left over for later. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best sushi take out place in Mississauga. Price is really reasonable and quality of food is EXCELLENT.  I love coming here for my break. :) thank you always!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite take out sushi places! The prices are quite reasonable and I am never disappointed with the quality of sushi I receive. As well, the owners are always very friendly and welcoming!"}
