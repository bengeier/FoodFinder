{"text":"Sammie's is a clean and pleasant atmosphere with excellent service and food. I would recommend the Daddy Mac and Cheese. It was outstanding. They have a good selection of beers and cocktails. It'd be good to have a list to choose from.  Try Sammie's; you'll be pleased."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere.  We were there to celebrate the season and were not disappointed.   Food was very good servings were generous.  We will return."}
{"text":"My wife and I have gone several times now. We have tried something different each time and been very happy each time. Our family that we have taken there has also loved the place. Staff is friendly the cool thing the first time had a nice waitress and got her again about 4 months later and she remembered us. Also a nice place to watch a game."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here last night...quite honestly we did not have very high expectations because it was a bar and grill....but....we were very pleasantly surprised!  My husband had the blackened sea bass and I had the yellow perch.  Both dishes were just wonderful.  It was served with a rice pilaf, fresh green beans and a hot breadstick.   The servers walking by with various meals that looked awesome made us really curious about other items on the menu.  The waitress, Michelle, told us about the specials there every night because we told her it was our first time.  The owner came over later to see how we had enjoyed our meal.  Although it isn't close to our home we will definitely go back."}
{"text":"What a great place to come have a drink and a burger!  There is a reason why Sammies is packed on a nightly basis.  Great service, great food and a great atmosphere.  I highly recommend eating the Sammie burger or any of the chicken dishes.  The food is prepared by hand in the kitchen and you can tell because it tastes great!"}
{"text":"Great place for burgers. Would have given it a 5, but the beef short ribs came up lacking."}
{"text":"Always slow service. Even at lunch. Foods overpriced for diner quality. Clean. Owner, Dave, is around sometimes and will say hi."}
{"text":"In front from out ot town, found this place and glad I did.  Good food and some good beer to boot.  Had the Lake Erie Yellow Perch with rice pilaf and broccoli and a Great Lakes Chillwave."}
{"text":"Heard about this place from my mom (who is very picky when it comes to eating out) and she said she loved their food! So a friend and I decided to give it a try. The Food was wonderful, I got the chicken sandwich and fries and it was so delicious. My friend ordered the pretzel appetizer and was kind enough to share with me, we both loved them!! Thanks to our waitress who was great. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been to Sammie's a few times now and as I live close by I am ordering take out pretty often. So I guess that tells you my family and I highly approve. The staff has been great The food that we have had has been very good , My daughter and granddaughter both had the meatloaf dinner with mashed potatoes and green beans they loved it . The fried pickles with bistro sauce was very good . My husband was really happy with fish but said next time he would get fries instead of chips, Though, we had the chips in house they were salty and warm and good ,Not sure how they do them but after they get cold they were a little tough,  I'm hooked on the burgers  lol Built my own double stack, onion, pickles (love them) pepper jack cheese cooked medium It is perfect . Must get one today lol  I tried the chicken noodle soup chunks of chicken, very tasty broth  I think maybe a finer straight noodle would be really good in it but it was very tasty. I will try more of their soups as they have  4 or 5 regular and a special soup of the week. So stay tuned for more ( I'm sure) good reviews Welcome to the neighborhood Sammie's hope you stay"}
{"text":"Food was great, big selection of beers (seasonals too), reasonable prices.  Yelp wanted more text, so here it is again. Food was great, big selection of beers (seasonals too), reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Love this place The spinach salad is awesome I also tried the Blue Devil Chili and it also was awesome The waitress was fast and very friendly Definitely give this place a try you won't be sorry"}
{"text":"I have never had less than a good meal here. The dishes are creative. The wait staff is excellent. The atmosphere is relaxed and unhurried."}
{"text":"Excellent service during lunch from our server mike, fast and very friendly. Food was excellent and great portions. Will recommend their house burger to anyone interested! A great experience!"}
{"text":"Outstanding find. Food ranged from comfort food to higher end.  Family atmosphere with class.  Beer and wine choices great.  Service excellent and owner David personally spent time making us feel Like family.  Sammy is his daughter the way.  Atmosphere a little loud.  But overall outstanding."}
{"text":"This place is very good new local restaurant. We've had the tilapia, spaghetti and my fav the fish and chips. We get the mussels every time, which are amazing. They have some good mixed drink options like an Old Fashioned and Irish Coffee.  They're not a craft beer on draft place. All the beer they have is bottled, the draft beers are the regulars (Bud, Miller).   The service can be hot and cold though. A few servers are great, knowledgeable and friendly. But a few seem bothered to be there. Still a recommended place."}
{"text":"Surprise! Good food, mostly homemade, not Sysco. Love their meatloaf & green beans. Sis had tacos. We will be back. Don't know if I can get anything other than the meat loaf."}
{"text":"Very tasty and a great environment. I recently moved, again, and this time I ended up in Tallmadge, Ohio where I begun to scope out the places to eat as I am very familiar with Kent but not so much outside of Kent. So I knew that I heard good things about Sammies and I wanted to start the journey of trying new places here.   It did not disappoint! I went with a friend. She got French onion soup and a salad. The soup was very tasty but nothing that stood out incredibly and the salad was a hefty serving that did justice for anyone looking to be feeling complete and worthy of what they spent on food. I got a burger with BBQ pork on it. It was outstanding! I am in love and I still don't care who knows it. It came with fries and they were something to write home about. I could not say what is it, whether it is the seasoning or if they are double deep fried or something, but they were outstanding and I would go there just to eat fries  Their menu is expansive and their drinks are very fairly priced and good sized/quality. The prices are average to what you would find at an Applebee's or TGI Fridays but I rather support local and this is no means a bad choice. Seems to get busy and sometimes parking is tough but that is actually good other than the time you are waiting or looking, means that more than just this guy think it is a home-run"}
{"text":"Ate lunch here today and it was really good. I had a burger, made to order with bleu cheese and bacon. Delicious!! It came with fries which would have been better had they been hot. My mom had the Friday fish & chips special made from cod with a nice batter and homemade chips and coleslaw. They even had a small kids menu that included a drink for $5. The server was nice enough, a little rattled which is why I believe the food came out less than hot and delivered by the owner. Nevertheless, everything tasted great and we will be back again.  They also have a nice meeting room that would work for a shower or family get together!"}
{"text":"The Caribbean chicken sandwich brought me in and was slightly disappointing, needs more sauce. The burger my friend had, can't remember the name, it was spicy, was delicious and has brought us back twice. They also have tasty tea and really good fries, might be my favorite fries."}
{"text":"The food was better this time. The fries were killer but the services-the service was OUTSTANDIND! Do your self a favor and ask to sit in Mike's sections next time you go. The guy is AMAZING! Kind, courteous and very interested in doing a good job, even of they are really busy. He's the one we'll be using, either him or Jen who is also a great person to deal with also."}
{"text":"Think twice about going to Sammies.  I love local businesses, but this restaurant doesn't make the cut.   Appearances are deceiving.  Tried to eat lunch at Sammies today but left hungry and extremely disappointed.  If you want a beer, the place will work for you.  Here's why my family and I will not return to Sammies: 1.  Our Mac-n-Cheese (adult menu, not kiddie menu) was delivered cold.  The shredded cheese on top wasn't melted, and the noodles underneath were cold.  I would have asked to have it reheated, but the taste was not worth the effort. 2.  The server was good and removed the item from our bill, but then the bill we did receive was $15 for 3 iced teas and 2 sides of french fries.  Not even close to worth it for stale iced tea and french fries that came from the freezer. 3.  We had to search for the manager to share our negative experience, and while he was polite, it was obvious he didn't care a bit.  I was polite and diplomatic, and offered our feedback in hopes that a local business owner would at least apologize.  We didn't want a freebie, we just wanted to offer our honest feedback.  He just didn't care.  4.  My vegetarian sister and mother sought a menu item and found nothing, absolutely nothing.   Even the veg option of mac & cheese had bacon.  Kitchen and manager just don't care about folks who'd like something more than a burger.  The veggie option on the menu (fried portobello mushroom) is no longer available; that's just as well because the server told us that dish was a pre-made food service item masked by a deep fryer.  They just don't care.  Bottom line:  there are so many other great (locally owned) places in the neighborhood, I suggest you bypass Sammies and instead go where the folks in charge value you and where they take more pride in the quality of their food and customer service.  When we were there (45 minutes) we saw another table seated and leave prematurely... hmmm.   P.S. Check through the other reviewers... even those who have a few good things to say also include tell-tale details about food that is \"less than hot\"  or \"not that great\"."}
{"text":"Sometimes pick up food from here, have dined in a couple times. The service is always... decent. They have kids working the front which always seem more interested in talking to each other than seating you, but waiters are fine. I've never had anything I didn't like, but it's WAY expensive for what you get. Like, I think I could probably make the majority of stuff for less than I pay here. But I can't complain about the food, so I guess you're paying for convenience."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Great food at reasonable prices. Can't beat their happy hour prices. Friendly staff. Family owned establishment. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Been here a bunch of times, always get great food and excellent service.  Pretty good beer selection too.  If you like spicy food ask for the Scorpion Sauce, it's really good but beware, a little goes a long way."}
{"text":"Came here 1 Saturday night looking for someplace new. Crowded. Seated right away though. It's a bar but it has a separate area for the bar and the restaurant.   First thing I noticed is lots of families. Lots of kids and parents. So if you go around dinner and just want to drink. You might get a lot of family hour.   Next thing I noticed is the menu. It's not your average bar food. Large menu with lots of choices. Seems pretty cool!  But for the first visit I play it safe and get the Sammies cheese burger wrap comes with fries and onion rings. 1 of my 2 family members got the buffalo chicken wrap with fries,. He liked it. Said it was pretty spicy. The other got the sammies sliders with fries. She enjoyed it as well.   Our server was good. He was friendly and prompt.   I would definitely go back. As mentioned lots on the menu so I'd like to try other things.   Only reason I don't give it 6 stars is the kids running around. I know it's not Sammies fault but you do need to mind your kids and the other patrons. Be considerate. If the parents can't then the establishment should."}
{"text":"Last week a friend and I ordered from Sammie's for the first time. We ordered Sammie's Sliders, minus pickles and the Buffalo Chicken Wrap, minus lettuce. The Sliders were very good, hot and cooked to order. The Buffalo Wrap was also very good. Flavorful with just the right amount of spice. The only problem I had was with the prices. The Wrap was $10 and was supposed to come with coleslaw but didn't. Neither order came with fries or onion rings (or any other side). The appetizer we wanted to order was $14 and we decided against it. It's the only place I've seen where a Chicken Quesadilla appetizer is $14 instead of $7-$8. All in all, the food was good. It was prepared as we requested but it's a bit pricey for burgers, wraps and especially appetizers. We will go back but not often."}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan.  Just ate here the other day and loved the experience.  Everyone was very friendly and the atmosphere is inviting.  It's a really unique place!  The food was delicious and priced right."}
{"text":"Well, it has always been ok and it frustrated me that the wait staff never knew what beers they had (IPA in particular).  BUT!  Last night we had Joe and man he was on it!!  We had Bell's Two Hearted Ale on draft and Spicy Chicken Sliders (that were absolutely awesome with their hot pickle relish!!).  What more can I say, they got my attention!  I look forward to going again real soon!"}
{"text":"Big portions.  Really friendly staff. Sandwiches are great.  Meatloaf tasty The ice cream sandwich dessert is awesome"}
{"text":"Food was good but not very many choices on the menu. They suggest velveeta on a lot of stuff and we don't like velveeta. The French fries are good and they hand make their food so that's a plus. Good service."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is fabulous. Always great service and menu is a fair price. If you are in the area and want consistent service with great food you could do much worse than stopping here."}
{"text":"Went for 50 cent wings because I have been wanting to find a good wing place since I moved here 3 years ago (that isn't a big chain like BWWs). We also ordered the appetizer platter with cheese triangles, zucchini sticks, and onion rings. I got sweet honey bbq and my boyfriend got 3 different types, which I now forget. He really enjoyed all of his flavors and my honey bbq were perfect. I'm a little picky when it comes to wings, hate them soggy. Mine were coated in the thick bbq sauce but still crisp. Plus I had 3 drumsticks and 3 wings, the variety was nice. Our waiter took our order in his head and apparently forgot to put the platter in once back in the kitchen. He apologized profusely and then put it in for us and took it off our bill. Platter was good, mostly typical of what you'd expect but really liked the zucchini fries. Their burger menu looked delicious too, so we'll be back after this good experience!"}
{"text":"I was invited to dinner to celebrate my birthday. I must admit I cheated and read the reviews. My advice to people is, DON'T BELIEVE EVERYTHING YOU READ!!! It was an AWESOME EXPERIENCE!!! The 1st clue was the parking lot was packed. That's usually a good sign. We were cordially greeted, and immediately seated with our friends who had arrived earlier. The calamari was perfectly cooked and tasted great. The peel and eat shrimp was a pound of them and an appetizer the could easily satisfy 4 People! They were the best tasting shrimp I have eaten in years. I can't imagine how they must taste battered and fried. It was the quality of the shrimp and they were not overcooked.The seasonings only enhanced the shrimp that were prime/choice quality. My sister had a wedge of lettuce salad that was picture perfect and she ate every bite of it. It looked so good I can't wait to go back and order it. My friend had the Caesar salad that looked great too. I had a very generous serving of mussels that were seasoned to perfection, I had leftovers for a midnight snack! The dipping  bread was fresh and warm-yummy. Sammie's menu offers A Huge selection and I can't wait to wade through the menu. Our server was excellent and the owner took the time to make us feel very welcome. Sammie's is a gem and I pray our community supports this business so they can stay open a VERY LONG TIME!!! When I'm finished with this review, I'm calling to make sure reservation for my brother's birthday. He went to chef school and he knows great food when he eats it. Sammie's is well worth a try! Just remember don't judge a restaurant by it's bad reviews."}
{"text":"Five of us went to Sammie's, and everyone came away impressed. Three of us had the Sammie's Burger, and they were awesome! The other two had sausage sandwiches and they said they were excellent as well. Several of us had the onion rings, and they were big, hot and absolutely tasty. We also enjoyed a couple of appetizers, the pretzel sticks with cheese and fried cheese sticks...very nice indeed. It didn't hurt that we were there during Happy Hour too, got 2 bucks off on the draft beers. The downside....no room for dessert! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"ESCARGOT AND BENDY STRAWS! What more could you want? Perfect mix of casual and finer foods. So many things we wanted to try on the menu. Great service and friendly staff. We will be regulars here."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I don't think we will ever try the food. We walked in sat down and were bombarded by people drinking yelling. I understand that this is a bar and grill, but seating right next to the bar makes for a very unplesant dining experience. I couldn't hear the waitress. We left without ordering food. And we were still kind enough to leave a tip because it wasn't her fault."}
{"text":"Went with my roommate, ordered the pretzel bread appetizer and spaghetti with meatballs. Absolutely delicious ! Great service as well ! Will be back !"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for the first time after a recommendation from a friend . The atmosphere was nice and the service was very good. The cheeseburger sliders were excellent! The  pretzel appetizers were just ok (a bit overcooked) but I won't allow this to prevent me from coming back. FYI - We actually got to meet SAMMIE! :-)"}
{"text":"Went with my family about a week ago and was introduced to the owner. Turns out he used to attend school here in Las Vegas. Lots of choices on the menu and I my cousin and I decided to share the Mac n cheese. Yummy! Oh my this is my half of the portion. I could never imagine eating a serving by myself, lol. Great service also, they split the portion and didn't even charge to do so the way they do in Vegas. Looking forward to going again when I visit."}
{"text":"Came here after it was recommended to my by one of the local \"Un-Churched Hopeless Sinners\" groups that I belong to; we meet about once a month if we all remember to show up. The place looks nice from the outside; people complain about a lack of parking, but I usually walk here since they took my license away.  Inside, the décor is very nice, plenty of seating and the bar itself is very inviting. I see some people complain that it is too dark, but I don't see the problem there -- people are often better-looking in dark bars, especially after a Corona or ten, so who's complaining? Not me.  The beer selection is pretty good, a few decent selections on tap and a nice array of bottles to choose from. TV's for sports-watchers. As for the food, I did not order any on my visit (I had just eaten prior) but the meals I saw served at the bar next to me looked rather delicious. If I had more time, I might have lingered and ordered an appetizer anyway.  Crowd seems nice (this is Tallmadge, after all) everybody - including the staff - was pleasant, including the two Realtor-Babes who happened to be sitting next to me. All in all, a pleasant drinking / relaxing / oggling experience."}
{"text":"I went to Sammie's for an early dinner. My co-workers raved about it so I decided to finally give it a try. I had been in this building before when it was a Mexican restaurant so I was pleased to see that the tacky bright colored paint was gone. I love the decor. Neutral colors and some antique looking items on the walls along with some sports themed newspapers (mostly Cleveland Indians).   I looked over the menu for a good 5 mins before settling on the Sammie's burger. I went for the smaller of the 2 sizes which was the 9 oz. I'm glad I did because I couldn't finish it all. It also came with fries and onion rings. I ordered my burger to be cooked medium but it was well done. In fact, the outside was burnt & the meat was tough. I decided not to complain because I was pretty hungry. The burger came with cooked onions, dill pickles, Velveeta cheese, mayo, and an olive on top. It tasted ok. Mostly bland. Lacked seasoning in the meat. The fries were just plain bad and all stuck together in a clump. I did like the onion rings though. I suspect they were frozen.  Although the food was blah, the staff were friendly and honored my Entertainment book coupon. About 30 mins after my meal, I was across the street at K Mart & my stomach started rumbling. Bad. And now I'm sick. I most likely will not be back to Sammie's."}
{"text":"This place has the absolute best mashed potatoes I've ever had in a restaurant.     They also have a really good fancy macaroni and cheese called Daddy's macaroni and cheese, which is the best restaurant mac and cheese I've ever had...  They do \"fries of the week\" specials with really creative topping combinations."}
{"text":"The monday and Thursday happy hours are hard to beat. The owners mom can be rude behind the bar. Overall my favorite place in Akron behind Luigi's"}
{"text":"Great locally owned restaurant.  The burgers are huge and phenomenal!  The fries are crispy.  The service is friendly and the prices are fair for the portions you get.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I really want to like Sammys more.  Been there twice and had burgers from them at the Akron hamburger festival. Their strengths are creativity, fresh ingredients and a comfortable thigh dark restaurant.  The downside is pricing- everything including burgers are overpriced.   Staff always friendly and efficient. I hate to get to like a place that I think won't make it  and I think this dis that category.  It's unfortunate that the high price of beef is hurting places like this but they need to adapt. More and cheaper  pasta, salad and chicken dishes could offset high cost and losses on beef. Hope they can make adjustments and stay in business w/o becoming another Delany's."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood restaurant with tasty food and excellent service. The calamari was fried to perfection with sweet chili sauce. Our pretzel sticks were piping hot. My husband said the fried oysters reminded him of the way his mother use to cook them."}
{"text":"Love the Sammie's Burger, it's definitely 5 stars! We enjoy bringing our family there, service is always great."}
{"text":"This is I think my third or fourth visit. The service was great as always, especially for lunch time. Food is OK. I like Italian sausage sandwiches and have ordered it each trip. It won't  be ordered again. They offer it 3 different ways. Unfortunately I like it with green peppers and grilled onions. Usually when I've had it at other locations there is the juice from the sausage, green peppers and onions soaking the sandwich and bun. Not at Sammies. Their's is dry, very dry. It's not bad but needs a little bit more flavoring. I'll probably be Back since our church group like them, but I'll have to branch out on what I order."}
{"text":"Food is decent bar food, but somewhat bland and boring. Burgers, fried stuff - pretty much what you'd expect. There was a commotion one night and we heard loud swearing. Someone told us later that it was the owner's son being drunk and confrontational. Not very family-friendly."}
{"text":"Some interesting things on the menu, have tried the fish tacos which were good but the pineapple salsa type stuff on them was a bit too sweet. The chili cheese hot dog with the pretzel bun was pretty good. Wings are great. Burgers are great. Service is always excellent, too."}
{"text":"Still have to say after several times eating here, they have delicious food.Our waitress Michelle is very good at what she does. Glad to see her here"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, nothing like I expected. Pretzel appetizer was overcooked but still tasted good. Fries were pretty good, as was the meatball sandwich. There wasn't anything bad but also nothing that gave me a real hankering to put it on my regular go-to list."}
{"text":"Sammie's was perfect spot for happy hour with great drink specials and half off a bunch of apps. We got the mussel's, which were in a classic white wine garlic and butter broth, served with fresh warm bread. The portion was pretty big, however the smaller ones were a touch over cooked. We also got the fried mozzarella app. This was some of the best fried cheese I've had. The breading was thin and crisp and was a perfect ration of breading to cheese. The sauce on the side also had good flavor. We ended up ordering some wings too(not on happy hour), and they were solid. They were pretty big wings, but in my opinion, could have been a little crispier. The parm garlic was good and the classic hot buffalo was nice and spicy. I tried the scorpion garlic parm sauce on the side, and it was very hot! I put it on my standard garlic parm wings, and the flavors were so good and worth all the spicy burn. This place seems a little unassuming, but it was a nice surprise with how good the food ended up being. On the off chance in I'm in the area, I would go back in a heart beat to try the amazing looking burgers and onions rings we saw everyone ordering."}
{"text":"Great place for Burgers. Fantastic ambiance. Full Bar. Try the Sammie's Burger. I always get that. It's a nice joint close my work place. We not only have lunches here but take our customers here as well."}
{"text":"Sammies was a great spot for some happy hour apps where some are half price. I did find the mussels to be a little overdone, but the flavor was good and the bread was very fresh and warm.   The fried mozz was really good and a nice portion size. The wings were also tasty. They were decently crispy and the sauces were great. The parm garlic was straight up melted butter and a lot of it, with some parm and garlic. I was worried when I saw that much butter but it was actually really good!   The service was excellent too."}
{"text":"visited for lunch today. staff was very friendly. had the soft pretzel sticks with beer cheese dip to start which was great. I then had the BBQ cheeseburger which was cooked perfectly and very tasty.  I also had a orange margarita from the bar and it was among the best I have had.  I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Love Sammies, we come here anytime we are out in Tallmadge, food is great, French onion soup is to die for! Prices are reasonable for the quality of food!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Monday evening.   Nice place comfortable atmosphere.  Friendly  staff. I had beer and fish tacos  they were ok. My wife had dad's MSc and cheese it was very good.  Prices  a little high but still a good place to go. I'll be back"}
{"text":"Did not know what to expect. Had been I'm when a Mexican restaurant.  Boy was I shocked.  Inside is decorated well and inviting.  Got Mike as our server6. Great guy. Food was great tqdting. We had a build your own burger and Philly cheese. Very tasty. Onions were great. Fries were good too. Will definitely visit again  and recommend."}
{"text":"We decided to try Sammie's because we had heard through friends that it was good.  The first strike against this place is that it is really hard to get a parking spot in their front or back lot.  The atmosphere is a casual bar with very very loud music.  The music was so loud that we couldn't hear each other talking.  We ordered 2 appetizers that were your typical fried bar food.  My husband and I both ordered hamburgers and our son got the meatball sub.  Our hamburgers were very dry and tasteless.  The french fries were very heavy and soggy with grease.  My son said the meatball sub was very bland and the sauce tasted old.  If you like tasteless, greasy \"bar\" food, you might like this place.  We were not impressed at all and will not be going back."}
{"text":"As a long time Tallmadge resident I've dined at this establishment several times.   Tonight after arriving home from vacation we choose to have a quick dinner here.   Boy were we wrong.  After ordering it took almost an hour to get our food as several tables seated after us received their meals.   We noticed a large party in the back room was taking priority.  I finally got my side salad from the waiter who apologized stating they were backed up as orders were being pushed back. ???  When our order finally arrived most of the dishes were cold.   My wife's Blue Devil Chili was so cold it was not edible.   Obviously this had sat for some time.  The young waiter was very apologetic but the manager never showed their face. This whole ordeal took two hours to get out of there.  They gave 30% off of the bill but all i wanted was good food and service of which i received neither.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Another visit to Sammies tonight. Best part besides the cost of the lager was that the waiter did a GREAT job.  He was attentive when we showed up, kept an eye out for the third part of our group, took orders promptly, and did NOT introduce himself as if we came there to visit with the wait staff.  He said he would respond when we needed him, and he did, but otherwise left us alone. GREAT service. An example for all those waiters out there who think that constantly asking \"how are things going so far\" think they are doing a good job.   Anyone who thinks otherwise should go to a really high end restaurant and experience what good waiters do... which does not include getting up close and personal.   (rant over)"}
{"text":"Great little diamond in the rough of the Tallmadge-Akron area.  Food here is pretty darn good! Lots of comfort foods on the menu.  I shared a deep fried mozzarella appetizer with my wife, the appetizer was piping hot and delicious. I tried the fettuccine alfredo with chicken for my main course. Huge portion of pasta with a delectable sauce and the pasta also came with two massive breadsticks. Our waitress was very friendly and courteous. I am excited to go back to Sammies!!!"}
{"text":"I have dined at Sammie's Bar & Grill quite a few times and it always seems to be a hit-or-miss experience. They have some interesting and quality items on their menu but the execution is often not great.   I visited Sammie's today on my quest to find the best wings in Summit County and ordered a dozen of their buffalo wings. The lady who took my order was very confused at the difference between breaded wings and wings with skin on them. At first she told me they were breaded and came in that way, but then she checked again with someone else and found out they were actually not breaded and were fresh wings. This is not even close to the first place that seems to not know what breaded means. And for some odd reason, Akron has an obsession with breading their chicken wings!  There was really nothing good about the wings. The buffalo sauce was fine but they had an old-grease taste and they were very dry and overcooked. My picture gives these wings way too much credit!  I have definitely had good meals here before such as the fantastic cheese and crab stuffed mushrooms they had recently. The place also has a very nice atmosphere with the option of a more secluded dining section or the lively bar section."}
{"text":"We went last night for dinner. The place was pretty full and they seemed overwhelmed. Some cold mussels were mixed in with hot ones. Not sure I want to know what was going on there. They were all opened, so they must have been cooked at some point... Maybe reheated in a Microwave?  My salad was just OK. One of the mussel orders came out with dinner. The other two as appetizers. The waitress was apologetic and concerned about the issues. Because the couple we were with said it was normally better, it could have just been a busy bad night for them. I will probably try it again."}
{"text":"This is the place to go for a great meal and a nice atmosphere.  It has become my go-to for entertaining customers and co-workers."}
{"text":"We had a birthday party for my aunt here. The area was good size and the wait staff was very nice. The food just isn't that great. I wanted it to be really good but it's just mediocre. I'll try it again to be sure one way or the other."}
{"text":"I have now been to Sammie's two times let me start by saying the atmosphere is friendly very inviting staff is very friendly and treat you like family. Now let me tell you the food is outstanding potions are very generous and so good everything is fantastic the menu is vast something for every pallet. When you leave you won't be hungry nor upset about what you had to eat more like when I go back what will I try next. As the servers go by you look at all the different dishes and say I have to get that next time I'm here. I can't say enough about this place you have to experience it for yourself. This is a update to my first review this restaurant is so good as I have now became a regular and am working my way through the menu I need to update and let the world know the onion soup is excellent stuffed mushrooms with crab are so good but I must say I have never had anything that was not great but I have to let everyone know I found the ultimate item on the menu they have pork chops with a dude that is absolutely like nothing I have ever tasted it is so fantastic there are no words to describe them by far the best pork chops I have ever had and you have to try them they are unreal do your pallet a treat of a lifetime and order them they come with scallop potatoes that are fantastic and garden fresh green beans omg a meal fit for a king. Sammie's is my favorite place of all time I give them 100 stars you have to try this place you will not be disappointed no matter what you order."}
{"text":"Had another great meal at Sammies last night. The salmon was fantastic. The Apple crisp dessert is excellent. I would suggest they add a half size option because it is too huge."}
{"text":"I wish we had the chance to eat there, but the hostess didn't seem to want to give us a table. She told us it would be 15-20 minutes and we said we'd wait. She kept trying to push us into a booth, then a high-top table...except we were eating with older people who really couldn't get on the high chairs. She kept making excuses for why we couldn't have a simple table, including that she had reservations two hours and 20 minutes away. Really? Two hours and 20 minutes away?  Finally, we relented and took her high-top table as that's the only thing she was willing to give up. My sister even mentioned that it seemed like she was trying to talk us out of eating there.  Long story short, we sat at the high-top for 10-15 minutes and no one even said \"Hello\" to us. No beverages. Nothing. No wonder she made it sound like being out of there in two hours and 20 minutes would be difficult. But the dining room was only half full at that point.  It was a complete waste of time and a total failure on all levels.  I called on our way to another restaurant and spoke to a manager who was very apologetic, but it was too late. It was a birthday dinner and our first time there. We won't go back. What's the point?"}
{"text":"We have been here several times. I would rate it five stars most of the time.  The burgers are great! The hot pretzels with beer cheese are wonderful! Many other choices have also been wonderful (salads, fish, etc.) A couple times when they were really busy I felt that the food was not as good and the service was slow, so I give it four stars but it is usually awesome!"}
{"text":"D. Ok so one might argue against the place.  It's another house built by Sysco.  I wish they did more from local proveyors, and did more in house.  I have to admit I have not had one bad meal from here.  It's really good.  They have a talented young chef who knows how to turn out good product.  Service is excellent, and David the owner doesn't mind stopping by a table for a visit and to see how things are.  You will get a good meal and be treated very well. M. You kidding me D this place is so yesterday the food rides the fence on average. I hope your not selling us out for free beer there."}
{"text":"The calamari is my favorite thing on the menu. I had the seafood pasta last time and right now I'm waiting on my Sammy burger and fries. The draft list is great. This is my new favorite place to eat. *update: the Sammy burger was tasty but my wife got the fish tacos-holy moley!! That's the most delicious thing I've ever put in my mouth."}
{"text":"Hole-in-the-Wall for sure! But hey, it was so good! I had the chicken Cesar wrap and I was a huge fan. Very flavorful and well dressed. The fries were so yummy- zesty style. The ranch dressing was to die for! The inside is a little dark, dingy, and gloomy, but the outside patio where we sat, was nice. Would deff come here again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Wow! If you're indecisive, picking what you want off the menu will be challenging but you can't go wrong. Brought my dad on a Thursday, was so good that I returned Saturday with my girlfriend. Both times I have started with wings as an appetizer. They said the wings are never frozen and I believe it! Great size and fryed perfectly. When I went with my dad we both tried burgers, pops got the Sammies burger and I got the pulled pork burger. You have the option of 9oz or 12oz. Being the men we think we are we both got the 12oz..... too much for us both, guess we aren't the men we think we are lol. When I returned Saturday I got their famous mac and cheese with pulled pork (I like pulled pork) and was amazed again. The staff is outstanding and friendly. The environment is very homey and just a good atmosphere to be in. Visit this place ASAP!! Sammies has got it going on!"}
