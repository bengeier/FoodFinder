{"text":"The Fresh Italian Eatery used to be really good when the original owner Marco was around. He was extremely friendly, often engaged me in conversation as if he had known me for years, and his food was always great. I could taste the passion he had for food and his enthusiasm always showed with every interaction.

Now, under new management, everything has gone to hell. Besides the phoney sign selling Marco's history story since 2002, the food is day/night from what it used to be! I ordered a Veal Plate - now costing nearly double what Marco used to charge - and everything was luke warm, smelled funny, and tasted horrendous. This place is absolutely vile now and nothing like it used to be! A name change should have been in order as well: The Stale Italian Wannabe. Yuck. It's too bad this new place is tainting Marco's legacy.

I would never bother wasting my money here again. Ever. Merely thinking about my atrocious meal again makes me sick!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for great tasting food that doesn't make you feel like crap after you eat it, you need to try The Fresh Italian Eatery! EVERYTHING is fresh!! And you can tell the moment you bite into it! 

I usually get the meatball sandwich which Marco the owner makes himself every morning! They also have fresh baked pizza slices for only 2 bucks if you're penny pinching! 

There is always a line up during lunch and the owner is super friendly and generous! 

DEFINITELY worth your money!!"}
{"text":"Most definitely a hidden gem in Toronto.
They've been at the Grange for a few months now, and it's the only place in that whole area where you can get a great meal, and an outstanding price.
It lives up to its name, food there *tastes* like fresh. 
The owner is great and very personable and you can tell he has great passion for what he makes.
I've tried everything, from their Italian Roast Beef sandwiches to their salads...all very tasty!
Suggestion: to whatever you get at this place, make sure you add their great Giardiniera."}
{"text":"Delish! Really good value too, especially their daily specials. They put a lot of fresh ingredients and different flavours in their sandwiches. Would be back for more!!"}
{"text":"The veal sandwich=disappointment for an empty stomach. A soppy soggy mess. If you want the best of this genre of cuisine go to St. Lawrence Market"}
{"text":"Do not go. Went to go pick up my meal pal order and was not impressed. Will not be going back. Though the workers there seemed really nice the food was subpar."}
{"text":"Have gotten food here a few times. Like stated in other reviews, the owner is a really nice, hard working guy. Even when busy, he'll take the time to speak through the food and what's in each sandwich/dish. Gave us several tasters the last time when we were struggling to choose and even some free tasters in a box for our son to have while we were eating. Their ravioli is surprising good for pasta not cooked to order- not over done or dry. Pulled pork done in house is excellent as is the parm chicken and eggplant. Specials include sandwiches from about 5 dollars- amazing value ( different one for each day). Prices are very reasonable even off this menu. There's a lot of competition in the food court but they well deserve a visit"}
{"text":"This place is simple and hits the spot.  Most recently I had the Eggplant Parmesan sandwich, usually I don't even like eggplant but I'm vegetarian and wanted a quick meal on the go. It was filling but not too heavy, which is rare in Italian food! And it was well wrapped so even someone like myself who is a messy eater was able to have the sandwich without becoming a dripping mess. It had lots of nice little touches such as a toasted bun and several toppings put onto it.

The staff are very kind and sweet. 

The price is right - it's hard to get a filling meal most of the food is under $10.

Great value for food court food, will be coming back more often when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Why this place is a 2 star and not a 4 or 5. This is my second time coming here and I've been baffle why this is four stars on yelp but the food is cold and tasteless. 

After reading Gordon's review I've learned that the owner have been replaced. Chinese people making Italian sandwiches. I thought we pride ourselves in making good imitations but not here."}
{"text":"delicious authentic Italian food. Growing up in a Montreal suburb with loads of Italians, some as my best friends, this food is on point. You can taste the love they put into the food. I've eaten two kinds of pizza, margaritas and the sausage, margaritas is my favourite and the daily sandwiches/nonna plates are good value and very filling I usually go with the chicken or veal parm. Worth a visit if you're in the area and craving some delicious Italian eats. bonus you get to watch the OCADU hipsters eat there. ask for Giadinera if you love pickled veggies, these things go with everything!"}
{"text":"Excellent sandwiches and friendly service. Authentic Italian prepared spreads and toppings, wonderfully marinated. Almost everything here is prepared by the owner. 

Favourites are pulled chicken, roast beef and eggplant or veal parm."}
{"text":"Definitely worth a visit. They're sandwiches are top notch at an amazing price. The owner is a great guy and an even better cook. Easily the best place in the Grange, while still having some of the the most competitive prices. I'd recommend the Veal on a Bun, you can't go wrong with that."}
{"text":"Enjoy a hearty Italian meal, with a twist, at The Fresh Italian Eatery in the communal The Village by the Grange!
Try the mouth-watering Lasagna - made us think that this is exactly the dish that an Italian Nona would use to fatten up her skinny grandkids!
Check out our full experience review for more!"}
{"text":"I stop by here every so often when I want to grab something quick for lunch.. Good prices and the veal sandwich was pretty great."}
{"text":"Rating: 3.5

So I have been wanting to try out this place for over a year now and finally, today, I decided to get my lunch here. Now, I have heard many good reviews on this place, so I had pretty high expectations. I decided on the Eggplant Parmesan. I didn't eat this right away though (cause I just did NOT have an appetite at all today -- actually scratch that -- these past two days.) I ate it like over 7 hours later LOOL. (still tasted good so ;; winwin for me) 

When I finally unwrapped my sandwich at 7:37 pm, it looked like a hot mess. Now that was probably my fault because I just jammed it into my bag. I noticed when I held the sandwich that there was meat in it? I'm pretty sure they gave me the chicken parmesan instead but hey homegirl ain't mad. 

Taste wise, it's good. If I had an appetite, I probably would've been in like heaven. It tasted pretty much like a pizza. I asked for it to be spicy so make that a spicy pizza with chicken on top LOL. 
 
Would I recommend this place? 
Definitely! Don't be like me and eat it hours later but yeah i'm pretty sure their stuff will taste the god damn bomb when it's nice and fresh ~ Quantity was pretty good too and price wise, it's not bad. 

bonus: they have pretty nice staff so woo hoo to that"}
{"text":"Damn good sandwiches. Try the eggplant parm!"}
{"text":"In the grange food court is where you will find this wonderful food counter that serves up (one would argue) Toronto's best Italian sandwiches. 

When I first came here a few months ago, I was blown away by the price of their specials. For four dollars you get a loaded veggie sandwich, a drink, and their chips. You can hardly get a veggie sandwich alone at that price normally. Despite being inexpensive, they use a generous amount of toppings that are made fresh daily (mushrooms, beans, eggplant, etc). They also use fresh bread from a local bakery. Their \"chips\" are also very unique, slathered in tomato and pesto sauce. My mouth is watering just thinking about this. 

Despite the food being of excellent quality and value, my favourite part about coming to this place is getting the chance to talk to the owner. He is a super friendly guy, who always greets you with a warm smile. And when you leave he will say, \"ciao Bella!\" 

This place should get way more attention! It is truly a hidden little gem."}
