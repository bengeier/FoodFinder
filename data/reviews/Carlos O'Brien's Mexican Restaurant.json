{"text":"This is my favorite place! The salsa is great!  They are quick  and friendly and I've never had a problem!  My family and I have gone here for years.  The tamles and chimichangas are great.  The tacos are good but expensive.  The margaritas are great and cheap!"}
{"text":"Love the new location!!!   I haven't been to Carlos' since they were on Frank Lloyd Wright and wow!   You can fit a medium size army in here, with loads of room outside.  Same familiar faces working the bar, too!!!   Food is always good...that goes without saying."}
{"text":"Always go to this location as it it right by our house. Food is always great and price is good. Staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"The food was great. I had the cheese enchiladas and a beef taco. My friend ordered the chicken quesadilla for her son. The only reason I didn't give them 5 star is because the portions sizes are huge. We could have split the dinner and been just fine. The waitress was very good and helpful. All around great food"}
{"text":"We used to go to the Scottsdale and Bell location frequently.  The new location has a great new bar area, and the food is still great of course.  Just longer waits now to get seated, and they have removed some of the really good items on the happy hour menu."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness...some of the best Mexican food I have ever eaten. Alejandro was a fantastic waiter and did not steer us wrong on ordering. Do not miss the jalapeño cream cheese!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service!!! Love the guacamole and pollo fundido. And Christian and Sean at the bar make tasty margaritas!"}
{"text":"Maybe we went on a \"bad\" day for the restaurant, but this particular Carlos O'Brien's left MUCH to be desired in the way of both food quality and friendly service. I've eaten at the Avondale location and left there very impressed, so I was expecting a similar experience at this Northern Ave restaurant. Sadly, this was definitely not the case.  I ordered shredded beef tacos with a side of beans because I like the result when the taco spills over onto the beans - it makes the beans especially tasty. However, someone needs to teach the cook how to make authentic Mexican refried beans because these were shameful. First of all, they were red; not brown, but red. Not sure what they put in them to make them red (I was afraid to ask), but it looked as if they may have added red chili sauce or some type of red sauce to turn them that color. Whatever it was, it didn't enhance or noticeably change the flavor to something favorable. Plus, when the waitress brought the plate to our table, the beans appeared to have a dried, crust-like surface and rounded edges, kind of resembling a pancake...only red...with a tiny bit of semi-melted cheese on top. I've had WAY better refried beans from some of the drive-thru places in the area. In fact, I don't think I've ever had worse refried beans anywhere. These were not like the refried beans I had at the Avondale location.  On a positive note, the tacos were very good once I added a mixture of salsas and pico de gallo. Salsa and pico de gallo are what make or break my dining experience at a Mexican restaurant, and I found the hotter version of the salsa to be the most flavorful at Carlos O'Brien's. Someone needs to also teach the cook how to make pico de gallo that has flavor; but, as a tomato and onion garnish, it passed. The salsa in general needs more garlic and cilantro, in my opinion.  So, will I be going back to this location of Carlos O'Brien's? Not a chance. It just wasn't that good, nor was the service very friendly. Maybe our waitress was tired...who knows...or cares, as I'll be enjoying my Mexican food elsewhere in the future."}
{"text":"This place was tasty even though my the meat on my taco salad was a little dry. It had a great atmosphere that would be great for families. They were super helpful with any questions I had and always kept my glass full. Overall, I had a great time."}
{"text":"Love the food and service!! Best food in town and the catering is awesome! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch for the first time and had David as our server. He was super attentive and the food was awesome!"}
{"text":"this is a great mexican restaurant. i've been going to carlos obriens since 1985. the portions are large and oozing with cheese and sauce. i don't eat rice or beans and with the large enchiladas and tacos, you don't need them. you can easily fill up with just the enchiladas & tacos. everything has alot of cheese and sauce, covering the whole plate. the chimi's are huge. fantastic chips. they do have a nice bar with plasmas and you get free chips and salsa  whether you're there to dine or drink. the service has always been good. this is a large, good restaurant. they do have a happy hour in the bar. you can call ahead and order food and they give you plenty of sauces with your to go order."}
{"text":"I just had them cater my wedding, and it was perfect. Jeff was very helpful and I would definitely pick this place if your wanting to get Mexican food catered to your event."}
{"text":"This is strictly a \"produce as much as possible\" for the masses.  The food used to be good.  it is now made with cheap ingredients and tastes like oil.  It is pretty bad and the salsa has taken a real dive too.  It used to be fun and enjoyable.  Now it seems like an overpriced fast food place.  Don't go!"}
{"text":"This isn't my favorite Mexican Place in the Phoenix area BUT it's Good!  I love their Tacos, Cheese Enchiladas, Chimi's and their Greenchili.   My friend and I love to order their quesadilla with Green Chili inside...  Their chips are always fresh and the salsa's are good too (I like to mix them together).  They have some tasty Margarita's as well.  I would recommend anyone to go to this restaurant.  On top of great food the service is also good!"}
{"text":"Carlos O Briens is an institution!  I have been eating there for over twenty years.  I have seen the same manager and bartender for at least 14 years - maybe they've been there longer- I dunno.  But what I do know is that this place is great.  The food is consistent - everything tastes exactly the same as it did 20 years ago, the portions are still just as big as always, and the prices are still very reasonable.  They have the best shredded beef taco I have ever eaten.  I am a third generation Phoenix native and have eaten at all the other places - Macayos, Garcias, Matador, La Canasta, Carolinas, Tee Pee, La Tolteca, Oaxaca, and all the various taco wagon type joints as well.  Carlos O Briens is the place I come back to time and time again.  It's the Durant's of valley mexican food."}
{"text":"I love this place!! I live down the street so I'm there at least once every couple of weeks, more if I had a bad day at work! The food isn't the best, but the carnitas dinner and con carne dinner is delicious!! The service in the bar area is amazing!! Definitely worth trying for happy hour or anytime actually...They treat you like family and we always end up making new friends. There are a lot of regulars that go so it creates a nice friendly environment. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Carlos since I over to AZ in '88. I almost always order the #13, A Little Bit of Everything,  it literally feeds me four meals, if you havent had it, TRY IT!  Ive been going since before kids and when I was pregnant I'm pretty sure we went twice a month, my kids have been raised on it. My son is now in the Air Force stationed in Albuquerque and complains their Mexican food just isn't like Carlos'. When he is home we go once or twice so he can get his fix. We always went to the original  location on Northern and my kids like that one the best but I  like the new Scottsdale location as well and it's close to my house. I agree with the person that said they hope they never close!!"}
{"text":"As a native this has been and remains to be my fav. While other local hot-spots have come and gone...this one remains tried and true! I love the salsa and taco sauce here!! I love to mix them...so amazing! These folks work their hearts out and frankly provide better service than many trendy, spendy restaurants! If you want great mexican food consistently at reasonable prices...this has been and always will be the Phoenix go-to!"}
{"text":"Oh man.  Where do I start with this place?  I absolutely love it.  The only reason it doesn't have 5 stars is because it has a devastating effect on your waistline with frequent visits.  A look around at your fellow diners will confirm the fate that you too will suffer if you don't mend your gluttonous CO ways.  Eat in moderation - especially here.  Then again, that really shouldn't deter you from stopping in. Especially if it is your birthday - because this is THE PLACE FOR BIRTHDAYS!  Every single time, without fail, and more predictable than the US Mail - someone is celebrating their birthday.  When I would go often, it was understandable.  But now that I go much less frequently (for reasons stated above - yes I fell victim to it), it is amazing.  My 2x a year visit, and it happens to be someone's birthday.  I wish I had those odds with the lottery.    They have some of the best chip's and salsa in town and great beers, both in the bottle and on tap.  And they just keep 'em coming....free of charge, like it should be.   My favorite sunday afternoon past time would be hanging at the bar, drinking XX Lager, and consuming mountains of chips.  The burritos are excellent to - although I tend to stick to the bean burrito with enchilada style (with red sauce) since it does well left over.  And trust me, leave some food on your plate.  Or suffer the consequences (see above).  Cheese Crisps, Nachos, Fajitas and tacos are pretty tasty.  Everything is smothered in cheese, beans, and rice and served on hot colorful plates...just like comfort mexican food should be.  I have never been disappointed with any visit to CO, well, except the time I found out they stopped serving the  choc-star-lite mints after dinner.  That was a real downer."}
{"text":"Oh my, dare I...yes, I'm going to have to go with 3 stars.  Normally I would shun, poo-poo, and dismiss a gringo-Mex place like Carlos O'Brien's, but I got thinking that for what it is (gringo-Mex)... it's pretty darn OK!  Last night's meal of grilled shrimp and vegetables clinched it. The tacos are pretty good, the chimis, the burritos...and to find a decent, light ,healthy option too (I gotta go healthy once and a while, just not too often), well that's special."}
{"text":"I like this place. The price is very reasonable and the plates are huge! Plus the food is really good my fave is the pollo fundido..... I have to say one of my top ten restaurants to go to.  Dessert fave is the galleta grande... Yummy!"}
{"text":"Food and service was excellent! It has been many years since my last visit and I'm thrilled that very thing is as I remembered,  friendly attentive service and large portions"}
{"text":"Carlos O'Briens has been a staple restaurant for my family for years. My parents took me there when I was a kid, and I've been going ever since. It is nostalgic. The interior could use some updating, but the layout is unique, which I like. I can make a meal out of appetizers and desserts, so at Carlos O'Briens, I go for the chili con queso (cheesy warm goodness) and the tasty fried ice cream. Carlos O'Briens is an oldie but a goodie, they could just use some updates on the inside."}
{"text":"I've given them about five tries to live up to their reputation. Disappointed every single time..."}
{"text":"Wow! Yum!!! So glad that Scottsdale Carlos is back!! Have already been five times since it opened. Love the new building and location!! The bar is very cool and I hear live music is starting soon. Can't wait!! Great to go eat and then see a movie or go shopping."}
{"text":"Went there with friends. Had the pollo fundido. It was good. Problem was there was a table of 20 somethings near us. They were very drunk, and the waiter continued to serve them. They were obnoxious, yelling f bombs constantly. My friend's wife eventually became irritated with constant barrage of expletives. At this point, I asked them to kindly cut back on the f-bombs. You would have thought I insulted their mothers by their response. immediately, the 4 guys became belligerent and threatened to kick our asses. One guy even asked the waiter if he could beat me up. He said that he knew the owner and he could do whatever he wanted. At this point, we decided to leave with our meals unfinished. I didn't take my family out to fight with 4 drunks. I spoke to the manager. He did apologize, and admitted that they WERE REGULARS. Apparently, he did speak to them, as they were leaving while we paid our bill at the front register. The manager didn't offer to comp us anything for our troubles. At least it wasn't boring. If you like to fight with drunks, maybe they will be when you go!"}
{"text":"First time there and it was excellent.  I had the shrimp enchiladas and they where great and my girlfriends pollo fundito was amazing. Good prices good portions."}
{"text":"Pollo fundido is something you should try .chicken cheese and sour cream.fresh chips and two great salsas. ..The best open cheese crips. ..they never disappoint"}
{"text":"We just moved in the area and were looking forward in having our Friday Family dinners here. Waited 20 minutes for our waitress. No apology nothing just asked us for our drinks and were we ready to order. Dinner wasn't bad but nothing great... 11.95 for my meal with no rice and beans... $50 later for the three of us kinda made it sting a little more... so I informed the hostess of my concerns, she gave the I will let the manager know answer... So since the food is ok but the service is most likely the norm. I don't think I will be back.. I can do fast food for that kind of service.... I don't think I can give a star due to the service but yelp forces me to."}
{"text":"My family and I stopped by Carlo's O'Briens while on a trip to Arizona. We wanted Mexican so I found them from Google. I was surprised because the yelp reviews were only around 3 stars but overall I felt GREAT service and Great FOOD!! Ecspecially the \"Queso cheese dip\" YUM! They have a nice patio with plasma T.V. . Overall great relaxed atmosphere. For the price this restaurant is Delish!"}
{"text":"Great service, reasonable prices, and generous portions. What more could you ask for? How about good food! My lunch special of beef enchiladas were flavorful and came with lettuce, tomato, and sour cream. The standard sides of rice and beans were moist and delicious. Chips and salsa were, like the entire meal, several notches above average."}
{"text":"Good food and fair prices. I have never had a bad experience here. Servers are always friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I have been a Carlos'Briens fan for many years and having not been there for a while my better half and I decided to grab a quick bite at the bar last night. I really have nothing good to say about any part of our visit. Having been in the restaurant business myself I can be pretty forgiving when it is obvious that the place is understaffed and I am willing to be patient as long as it is acknowledged that I am sitting there waiting...instead we literally waited (at the bar) for 15 minutes without either one of the bartenders making so much as eye contact. I finally had to wave my arms before somebody said Hi. I was not the only one having this problem as both people to either side on me had been waiting longer than we had and a couple of the tables gave up and left. We finally placed our order of queso dip and a chimichanga with a bartender that was less than thrilled. The queso was really bad and chimi was mediocore at best. Nobody ever asked if there was an issue with the queso as the bowl was literally untouched. On the upside the chips and salsa are still good. We paid our tab and bailed. I made a quick stop to the restroom only to find it out of soap with the trashcan overflowing and paper towels all over the floor. All and all a very disappointing trip. Carlos O'Briens needs to make a serious effort to get their restaurant back to what it used to be."}
{"text":"I want to like Carlos O'Brien's. Because it's basically within walking distance of my house. I really do want to like it. Unfortunately, I don't. Don't get me wrong, everything I've had here is passable, but nothing really shines.  First off, the name. Carlos (Latin) O'Brien's (Irish). In the spirit of, say, Chino Bandido's, I think it's reasonable to expect that the food at O'Brien's should have a Latin-Irish mashup. Spicy Irish classics? That could be cool! But no, they don't do this. As a matter of fact, the place might as well be called Carlos Martinez' - because there's nothing on the menu at all even remotely Irish. This is a straight-up \"Mexican\" sit-down restaurant experience that seems to be trying to emulate Macayo's.  And this is why they fail. While their food is as palatable as Macayo's in many respects, none of its acoutrements (those things that take Macayo's to another level) are polished enough to service what is, in the end, bland Ameri-Mexican food. Chimichangas? Check. Mini-version-of-everything appetizer plate? Check. But their taco meat tastes almost like straight beef, their rice and beans sucks, their salsa is bland and boring, their guacamole is tasteless (and expensive) and their sour cream is weirdly salty. Their salads are uninteresting afterthoughts. I dream about Macayo's' Fiesta Salad - the salads here all taste like Denny's salads put in a tortilla bowl.  In short, if you want some unique Mexican food, go local. Go authentic. Even if you're looking for something to satisfy your American craving for strip-mall chain-food Mexican, you can do better than this."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Where do I start? Carlos O'Brien's was my first eat-out experience when I moved here and I have gone back many, many times since. It's a great place to meet and eat - they have a huge restaurant with plenty of seating. The food alone is a reason to go, but the staff is always friendly and the service is very quick. My favorite dish is the CHICKEN FONDIDO! If you like fried chicken, cheese and cream cheese THEN LOOK NO FURTHER because the Chicken Fondido is the end-all be-all of amazingness! Granted that the food is not authentic Mexican, it is very interesting to combine Mexican and Irish food. Coming from a Spanish and Irish family, I felt quite at home looking at the menu and having to choose between corned beef and nachos. And it gets even better when you consider the prices. For the over-the-top portions you receive, the prices are very agreeable.  The atmosphere is clean, friendly and inviting. If you're on a date you can ask for a more intimate table and they will be happy to seat you somewhere you can kanoodle with your date. Drinks from the bar are prompt and put together correctly. Never once have I had to send something back to be remade - even when I've ordered complicated mixed drinks. A couple can go and have dinner, drinks and dessert for under $30. I really, really enjoy this place and highly recommend it to everyone: single people, couples, families and friends!"}
{"text":"Just ate a delcious Mexican pizza here.  It's so yummy!"}
{"text":"Favorite Mexican restaurant!! Even though they're always very busy we always get in and get our food quickly. I always get the chimichanga because theirs is the best."}
{"text":"My family ate here fairly late and we were all starving. Our waiter was friendly and never neglected to refill our drinks or ask us if there was anything else we needed. I am a vegetarian, and there were a lot of options for me. The vegetable fajitas were delicious - probably the best I've ever tried. My family said that the beef tacos and beef burrito were amazing as well. We had eaten here before, but not in a long time. Now, however, we'll be sure to keep this place on our restaurant radar!"}
{"text":"I've lived in the Valley for 20 years and never ate here until a couple of months ago, despite it being highly recommended by a lot of people.  I think I have to rethink my opinion on the people that recommended it....YUCK!!!!!! The food has no flavor and everything is covered in shredded iceberg lettuce and \"mexican cheese blend.\"  Plus the restaurant looks and feels like it hasn't been cleaned or changed since 1984.  I actually didn't want to touch anything.    Shut this place down.  You're done."}
{"text":"This has got to be the best Mexican Restaurant in Phoenix that I've ever eaten at.  Then again, it's really the only Mexican Restaurant that I've ever eaten at in Phoenix in the last 20 years.  I'm from Sacramento, and it really beats any Mexican food that we've got up there. Proximity might have a lot to do with it, but I really appreciated the food. The portions were plentiful, the food was top notch and spicy, but the service really needed to improve.   I was waiting for a doggie bag and a box for 20 minutes.  Otherwise, I'd recommend it heartily."}
{"text":"I am very regretful to write this but I feel that I have to. Carlos O'Brien's used to be one of the Best Mexican restaurants in town. Not so any more. They have gotten really expensive and as high as the prices have gotten the food quality has dropped in quality equally or more. I ordered the spinach Queso which we love. You could tell it was leftover from the day before. It was thick and orange in color, The flour tortilla were dk brown, not golden like they should be. In general the food quality has gone down drastically. We can eat at Ariba's twice for the price of one poor quality dinner at Carlos O'Brien's."}
{"text":"Having been a regular customer to Carlos O'Briens since they were a little restaurant on 16th Street/Bethany Home, I cannot express how disappointed we were in this new location on Mayo Blvd.  Lets start with the tiny shot glass of hot sauce to the small bowl of salsa with i might add weren't  provided a spoon so we had to pour it out of their containers which made a mess, to the cold stale chips...no water was brought...when we asked Jose our waiter for more containers of salsa and hot sauce we were acknowledged coldly.  I don't know if Jose was new or just upset that he had to work Mothers Day but his attitude was terrible from the beginning and since this is our favorite restaurant we tip exceptionally well when we go there.    I don't know if employees from 12th Street/Northern were sent over to train the newbies on how to treat the clientele that keeps us going over all these years but they should have...we wont be going back to this location which is a shame.  The food was good, with the exception of the rice, which was mushy and very over cooked, and the beans were burnt.  Not the standards that is Carlos O'Briens."}
{"text":"Tasty Mexican food, great lunch specials, attentive staff who always greets you with a smile"}
{"text":"We got fish tacos and Pollo fundido. The food came out super fast and it was delicious. Service was great,  too"}
{"text":"Excellent waitress. Chill decor. Massive entrees. And tasty chips and salsa.   Ordered the chicken and beef fajita. The fajita meat is a tad fatty and chewy but the shear size of the skillet and the fresh tortillas (a single order can easily feed two people) makes up for the mediocre taste. All in all I would recommend this place if you're looking to try a Mexican restaurant that you haven't already tried in the local area. Tourists might find better and more distinctive Mexican restaurants to munch in while visiting Pheonix."}
{"text":"Portion is huge with greasy cheese overdripping each chip under heavy blanket of nachos. If that's your kind of appetite, go for this place!  Overall, it's better than Taco Bells."}
{"text":"One star only because no stars are not an option. WORST experience! Stopped by to grab a late dinner only to be left with an unpleasant experience and a promise it was the last time we would be stopping in.  After getting seated at a dirty table, it took about 10 min for the server to come and attend to us. In the mean while, we found napkins to wipe down the  dirty tables. After the bus boys brought us the water, we then had to find straws. We placed our order and surprisingly our food came out pretty quick. Umm yeah that was probably the first indication that we where heading down hill from here.  Our table ordered the green corn Tamale, chicken fundido ,  enchilada/taco combo plate and chicken fajitas. ALL was TERRIBLE! The worst was the Fajitas which were bland. Anyways NEVER did the waitress came by to ask if we needed anything and when we finally tracked her down to get a sauce of some sort to sauce to put on the fajitas to make them eatable, rather than ask if we would like something else she brought us enchilada sauce with an attitude. Needless to say, they where still terrible. NOT edible. after hunting her down again, we asked for our check as we couldn't eat the terrible food or deal with the the horrible service. Of course another 10 MIN went by before she brought us the check. Then after we clearly let her know the food was not edible, she sees the plates where full, she hands us a $75 bill. Lol when I told her she needed to remove the fajitas as that was a complete plate that couldn't be eaten she again with an attitude was gone for a while before bringing us the revised check. We will never return to a Carlos Obrien restaurant after experiencing the worst service and terrible food!"}
{"text":"This is my family's go to Mexican restaurant when I am in town. The service is consistent and time efficient. Bless the staff who run all over this place because it feels much bigger than the location on Bell and Scottsdale. The machaca is amazing any way it is served and the Cadillac margaritas are my favorite! Please eat fried ice cream when you visit, if you have not tried it then you are missing out."}
{"text":"Great food and service but needs to be remodeled! Long over due... great happy hour and lunch specials too."}
{"text":"This is the third time I've eaten at O'Brien's Northern ave. location.  The first time was great, just a few months ago.  I live a long way from O'Brien's.  The second time was OK, but not as good as the first time, but we enjoyed ourselves, thinking it was an off day that evening.  Last night we had our friends with us and it was horrible.  Quantity was not the problem, there was plenty.  The St. Gria was served in short stemmed glasses with LOTS of ice.  We had large glasses before with little ice twice before.  One in our party had to exchange their meal for something else because it was so bad.  He couldn't even identify the kind of meat he was trying to eat. Another in our party, and myself, couldn't finish most of our meal, chicken tacos, because it lacked any flavor.  The beans were fine but the rice, this time was very dry. Meat tasted as if it had been boiled without any spices. All of us left plenty of food on our plates without any thought of taking leftovers home.  On the way home we talked about how disappointing the meal was, and how the quality had gone down so much. We concluded that it would be a LONG time before we frequent O'Brien's again, if ever."}
{"text":"Always great! I remember being a kid and having to wait in line around the building to get a seat. Well, now the food is still great and the wait is much shorter. I don't know why people waste their time going to lesser restaurants."}
{"text":"Be warned that the ground beef tacos aren't very good. The meat had little to no seasoning! This place seems to be striving for average at best"}
{"text":"Wasn't sure when we pulled up as some areas can look sketchy to out of towners. But this place was great!! Amazing food and service. Highly recommend. A casual restaurant with great company."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Carlos O'Brien's So when my bf saw this one we decided to give it a try. We went on a Friday night so I expected it to be busy but it's so loud in there you can't even hear the person across from you talk. Our waiter came over asked us what we wanted to drink, I ordered a Dr Pepper and my bf ordered a frozen margarita no salt. The waiter came back to bring my drink and had asked my bf if he ordered an margarita on the rocks no salt? That was just the beginning of the problems, so he got the drink order again and it took a bit to get it but by the time he got back we were ready to order, I am a creature of habit so i always order the same thing when I go to certain places. So I order a #5 which is 2 cheese enchiladas I ask for green sauce and no onions and it comes with rice and beans, he says ok my bf ordered a #1 which is a taco and and cheese enchilada with rice and beans. The waiter doesn't repeat or order just says ok and is off to put it in. When our food arrived mine had red sauce not green. So I told the runner that it was supposed to be green sauce no onions. He takes it back to correct it, well here comes the waiter and he says to me i didn't hear you say you wanted green sauce? You never told me that. I said yes I ordered #5 with green sauce and no onions. Well I didn't hear that he says. So he walks away I get my food back and it now has 2 enchiladas with green sauce no onions and guess what no beans just all rice! Humm ok? It comes with rice and beans so why only rice? So a few mins later he comes back again and I point out that I don't have any beans only rice and he looked at me like I was stupid, I said it comes with rice and beans correct? He said yes I said well there's only rice here he said oh so you need a side of beans? No problem let me get them right away in a very sarcastic tone. He brought me a bowl of beans but not once did he ever apologize for My order being wrong all he did was have an attitude and try blaming it on me. I will never return to this location again"}
{"text":"Food wasn't great, and the service wasn't great either. It was a slow day, with one other group of 4 people in there, so there was really no reason for service to suck."}
{"text":"The waitress was rude. Messed up our order and when they brought the correct order back the potatoes in it had black bruises on them. They asked if we wanted a refill and before we could say yes our glasses were filled.Will never eat there again!"}
{"text":"Love this new location and our first visit! Food and service was amazing! Visited on a holiday and the service didn't disappoint. I don't live near this location but will visit again and will bring the rest of the family!"}
{"text":"Just like the Veggie Fajitas they served my mama - this place lacked sizzle.  My mom has been raving and singing the praises of Carlos O'briens for sometime now and not wanting to miss out on somewhere good, she took me there last night.   When we got in the parking lot, and saw the look of the huge rock mountain of stone - I KNEW something was a miss... why are mountainous structures in Phoenix always home to great salsa and bland food? WHY?!  We entered and were seated right away in a HUGE dining area \"upstairs\" that was way cute back in 1990 when it was last redecorated - but this isn't 1990 and it's - kitchy. After I sat down and saw the plain looking laminated menu, I realized that my mom and I were the ONLY brown people in the building besides a bus boy who looked afraid of his own shadow! Red Flag #3!!  Our waiter Nathan introduced himself and seemed really nice as he brought our chips and salsa and took our drink order. We also ordered our food - I had the #13 - A Little Bit of Everything and my mom had the Veggie Fajitas. I must say that the menu is very uninspired and I wished to see some house specialties or innovation... inspiration and innovation are luxaries that Carlos O'brien can't afford.   Whie our food was being prepared, we enjoyed our chips and salsa which was VERY good, I must say! I SWEAR I've had their salsa before, I just can't place it! But it's still good and worth the trip alone. Our food came quickly and we were disappointed by the fact that my mom's fajitas lacked any soul, had some spice and weren't sizzling off the iron. Boo! She loved that her fajitas had ingredients not normally seen in fajitas, such as potatos and zucchini.   My plate was a big glob of gooey cheese! The guac on the chicken flautas were good however the flautas were a little over cooked. The Chimis were very good and I loved their cream cheesy sour cream type sauce - I just they didn't give me so much of it! I was scraping it off after my first bite. With a good chili kick and plenty of salt, my Green Corn tamales were DEFINATLY the best part of my meal!   And the toastada, rice and especially the beans were the lowlight of my meal. I never had a worse toastada, I don't even know how to you screw up a toastada - but leave it up to Carlos to figure it out. The rice tasted old and were dry. The beans also tasted old and had too much cheese, there was so much cheese that my lil bowl of beans was practically glued to my plate! GROSS!   We were still happy and eating away and I didn't think we were taking too long when Nathan our waiter gave us the bum's rush! He put down our check andd Offered to bring us to-go boxes when we were still happily eating and showed no signs of slowing down. I was like - there are FOUR tables seat in a 30+ table facility - there's NO ONE at the door, even then - you got the room!! Why are you rushing us out?! We requested two to-go boxes and when he returned with them he seemed disappointed in the fact that we hadden't paid yet. My mom quickly dropped her debt card and I was annoyed.  We did need to get going - we had another errand to run before heading home but still. The polite thing to do would have been to leave our check and tell us to take our time, replenish our drinks and WAIT for us to ask for a box. GEEZ! Some people's children!  To my fellow yelpers, if you want fresh, sizziling sexy Mexican food - avoid this place like the plauge. If you want to appease out-of-town relatives with sensitive palates to a nice Arizona Mexican dinner - this is the place for you! Have the green tamales and enjoy the chips with salsa, they're both quite good."}
{"text":"Great service,  great iced tea , funditos are amazing,  my favorite has always been chimichanga covered in green sauce."}
{"text":"Had the two beef enchiladas asked for ground beef but got shredded beef.  I did notice they were really busy tonight....could have been part of it.  But still tasted really good.  Would not keep me from coming here again when I am in Phoenix.  Really good authentic Mexican Food."}
{"text":"Been eating here since they were on 16th st.   Any company who keeps their employees for 30 years plus deserves our support!"}
{"text":"Keeping an open mind, but knowing how dirty the other/now closed location was, I get concerned that this new one might follow suit. This is just a friendly warning to the management to please keep up with things, and keep the place clean.   It was concerning that we found a dead fly in our salsa, and let me tell you, this was clearly a fly, wings and all. Our server was not too sympathetic and just simply made a note that she would tell the bus boy to stop doing that. Haha. Flies are no joking matter. Maybe we'll try them again down the road.  MAYBE.  But in the meantime we'll look  to see what other reviewers say over the next few months."}
{"text":"Carlos O'briens is a solid 3 stars. The service is hardly ever bad, but it is hardly ever amazing either.  The food is decent. They do have the best Pollo Fundido ever which really sums up the trick, it is bland white people mexican food; which is not an insult. Nor is it necessarily a compliment.  They are a good go to place for a sunday lunch, but if someone is visiting from out of town, you probably want to take them somewhere else."}
{"text":"The food is decent but the service was amazing. Frank is one of the friendliest people I have met in Arizona. I tried the chicken chimi and it was pretty good but the service better"}
{"text":"People from out of town seem to love this place. Me not so much. You can get way better Mexican food in Phoenix for cheaper. This wouldn't be one of my recommend restaurants if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I just wanted to share the best experience at their new location on mayo blvd. Loved the new location from the moment I walked in the door I was greeted by familiar faces.  One of the best things about this restaurant is walking into a familiar family atmosphere.  From the person who greets you at the door, Sean and Cristian in the bar always know what drink I want I dont even have to tell them and then when you get seated for dinner you know you will be taken care of.  You know that the servers whether its Alex, Katelyn or Jose will take great care of you, they all take the time to get to know you and you are not just another table.  The restaurant was incredibly busy but well worth the wait.  The Pollo Fundido as always was soo delicious. My entire family enjoyed this experience and we will most definitely be back.  Kudos to Carlos O'Briens for putting together a great staff and a great new restaurant!"}
{"text":"Food was oily, the place wasn't as clean as I would've preferred. The portions were large, though."}
{"text":"Whever I'm in Phoenix visiting familia, I request that we go to get some \"Mexican\" comida. I've had their food since I was an adolescente and I can honestly say the food hasn't changed. I still get my customary pollo chimi, with sauce on the side so it doesn't get soggy. Muy bueno! The chips/salsa at Mexican places can reel me in faster than a sugar daddy with a helicopter and Carlos knows his chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Greatly disappointed last night. Came to this location w/ my mother for dinner and we were greeted by a man who spoke so little English that ordering iced tea and a Perrier was a sincere challenge.   We then asked for the guacamole and chips w/ \"mucho flavor\" as the menu online said but the guy didn't know what I was talking about so I told him regular guac and chips would be fine. Perhaps it's a location thing but why have the \"mucho flavor\" on the menu if you aren't going to have it available? Anyways, the guy brings us a cheese crisp w/ guacamole smeared allover it.  ???  It wasn't terrible but definitely wasn't what we wanted.   About 45 minutes later, Ruben finally comes back so we just order small side salads to be on the safe side and get the heck out of there. No enchiladas, no tacos, no queso dip, nothing classic...we didn't want another order messed up.  ***I used to frequent this place years ago but it seems to have really gone down the shitter. Our nostalgic trip back was definitely our last."}
{"text":"Ive been coming for years and always enjoyed sitting at the bar.  However, since they have two lady bartenders working instead of the two guys ... it's terrible service.  One is too busy chatting with people instead of doing her job, forgets to put in orders, or just ignores you till you have to call her to get her attention, and the other one is texting on her phone. Terrible service at bar.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"By far one of the best places to get Mexican food. Been going here for over 15 years with family. Happy Hour prices are great especially with drink specials. But overall the staff do a very good job on service, nothing to complain about."}
{"text":"Been going to this restaurant for years.  The food is fine;  I mean its more your americanized Mexican food. But its one of the only Mexican American restaurants that I have returned to regularly over the years. I've been to several other Mexican American restaurants in the valley and I've never had any desire to return to any of them......Except for Carlos O'Briens.   The staff here are always friendly and attentive. This restaurant gets busy. Lots of families, couples,  groups. If your alone you'll also  feel very welcome too. The staff has a way of making everybody feel comfortable.  If you so desire you can sit at the bar for a drink and have your meal served to you there.  They have all of the usual Mexican American  Fare. If you are health concious, they offer a separate menu. This is the menu I always order from. But just so you know........ They may not automatically offer the alternative menu. So you my have to request it.  When your seated they ask your drink choice and then come back with your drink and a basket of freshly made corn chips and 2 large bowls of salsa one mild and one medium if you want a hot one just ask.  If you finish the chips and salsa they will bring you more. All complimentary.  The chips and salsa are pretty good. We all dig right in and we find ourselves munching away until our food arrives.   So many memories of dinning Here over the years. Thank you Carlos O'Briens.  Wish you many more year of success."}
{"text":"After a very very high recommendation, my brother and I decided to come here. We did have high hopes because we were hungry.   We ordered the nachos as appetizer (a small order). Then my brother got the skirt steak plate..forgot the actual name of the plate. And i got the sampler platter which had tacos, chiminchanga, enchiladas, rice and beans. Our reaction to my plate and the nachos was \"oh my gosh, what the heck did we order\".   To start, the nachos were soo smothered with cheese we ended up draining all the cheese grease into another plate. NASTY!! We only ate a few and just couldn't stand it anymore. And my sampler plate was just the same, everything and i mean EVERYTHING was covered up with cheese. The skirt steak plate was the only thing that was good. We didn't even eat a fourth of all the food and just couldn't take it anymore. Each bite of the smothered cheesy food was like taking a year off your life.   I mean, this place was so highly recommended we couldn't believe the food we got. I will never come here again. And will tell others not to come. The bill for two people was over $40...what!?!?  I am too use to the Mexican food in LA, cheap and good with flavor!"}
{"text":"Been twice both times was crappy soggy food with microwaved beans and dried out rice and expensive prices...do youeself a favor and go to central phx or find a roach coach and get the real thing for cheaper instead of this nasty overpriced taco bell food...and dont get me started on the flan either, yuck"}
{"text":"We waited 50 min for our entrée and we have to ask a refill  for our water and appetizer are completely forgotten until we ask about it. They take that our from our bill anyway, we left disappointed even we want to try there fried ice cream were afraid we might wait another hour"}
{"text":"Great service and the drinks are always good. Food Is pretty good and you get a large amount for the cost. The booze is a little more than most but they do taste good.."}
{"text":"Ordered for pick up and the food was pretty good! When the bag came out, it was huge and shocked us because we only ordered some lunch items and was given so much food!   LOVE their rice and beans! It was so flavorful and delicious. The fish taco was pretty good, the sauce is where it's at, I'm obsessed with the sauce! There was a nice spice to it. The chimi was a little disappointing though. I don't know if it's because we ordered to-go so when the chimi came to us, it wasn't crispy or anything but it was a little on the soggy side."}
{"text":"A long time favorite since their first location when I moved to Phoenix over 30 years ago. No better Mexican Food in America. My favorite is the cheese enchilada in red sauce, shredded beef taco, rice and beans combo. Fried ice cream and a Long Island Iced Tea. I own a Limousine Service and drive my customers to the closest location when they want the best Mexican Food in Phoenix. Get the Carlos O'Briens rewards card too..."}
{"text":"If your are looking for any kind of flavor in your food , this is not the place for you. I had a green chili burro with rice and beans, it had to be one of the most bland meals I have ever had, this the place for those out of towners, You know the ones from those cold states, who are not familiar with what Mexican food should taste like. I have to say it is edible, you probably won't die, BUT DEFINATELY NOT ENJOYABLE, TASTEFUL, FLAVORFUL, OR MEMORABLE.  This is not the place for true mexican food connoisseur.   As for  the service it was average, not anything special."}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be one of the best Mexican restaurant in town. Well, I guess not anymore. Last time I ordered 5 1/2 Chicken enchiladas. There was a big piece of female artificial finger nail in it. That was gross. I thought the accident may happen, so I choose to forgive the kitchen workers. However, today I went back and had the same food again. Guess what! There was a small piece of wire sponge in the food! OMG! Enough is enough! I don't care if they give me free lunch or not. I just want too eat \"food.\"  Nothing else, Please! BTW, the service was good!"}
{"text":"We prefer the location over by the race track. Service and food was much better over there. My chimi the meat was extremely dry. We ordered dessert for a birthday and never got it and finally gave up and left. Never got a side of sour cream that we asked for for one of the quesadillas either. While the server was personable, I don't know if he was overwhelmed or just having a bad night. Had the food been better, I would have overlooked some of the service but the food wasn't nearly as good as the other location. We were a party of 6. Everyone reported their meats being either to salty or dry and we all had different items."}
{"text":"Food was still good! Waitress forgot us a couple of times.  Looks like the place should be serving sushi instead of Mexican food. Decor leaves things up to the imagination.  Kind of lost in between dimensions."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for dinner and margaritas. We were seated right away and served chips and salsa  from there we sat and waited and waited for our waitress to show up.  We ordered food and drinks together because we weren't sure how long it would take her to return. Good thing because she didn't come back until food was ready.  I ordered the pollo fundido. The chicken had NO flavor and the cream cheese on the top was so thick you couldn't taste anything but cream cheese.  We will NEVER return!!!"}
{"text":"Jeff & Sean - the owners are characters. The food is wonderful - I love the jalepeno cream cheese, the guacamole dip and the pollo fundido chimichanga."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years and the food is great and the servers are great too!   I've only ever had one issue with them when I went one time but I believe it was because the server was new (most the staff has been there for years)  Great family restaurant, and if you want you can order in advance and just pick up your food to take home.  Every time we have done this (maybe 5 times recently upon discovering you could) our orders are always right, and they always give you extra chips and yummy salsa!"}
{"text":"Terrible. Long wait, food was a mess and unappealing. One of the worst places I've been."}
{"text":"Excellent, whether you just want to enjoy a cold Corona and a taco at the bar or a full Mexican meal in the dining room. Good for all occasions or just a quick lunch, this restaurant always has good food, fine service and plenty of parking. Whenever we're in Phoenix for the winter we make sure to have several meals at Carlos O'Brien's."}
{"text":"Service was slow and rude, but I enjoyed the food. Went with the #15 chicken chimi con queso, which was stupid delicious. Sadly ended up throwing up in the middle of the night, and my boyfriend got sick as well after eating my leftovers. Maybe it was the sinful nature of the food, because it didn't feel like food poisoning, but that's the only thing I ate that day. Only bother to order a house marg, because their \"top shelf\" and \"Mollyrita\" are the exact same as the house marg. Bartenders don't give af, so may as well just order the house for the price lol."}
{"text":"I am solely rating this place on its food. The staff and service were nothing but amazing.   If I could give give this place Zero stars for its food I would. We didn't go to this place by choice but went because a big party had decided to go here. We went with the flow assuming that most likely the food was not going to be the most delicious and amazing food ever but that it was going to be edible. Well , we were wrong , the food is disgusting , zero flavor, old tasting beans and rice , old guacamole- it was not green like it is supposed to be when it is fresh but brown looking. They also add so much melted cheese on every plate. Overall gross, not authentic food, but old food with a block of melted cheeses and sauces to make them look \"pretty\". If you want real authentic and fresh Mexican food go to Comedor Guadalajara on Central Ave."}
{"text":"The Mexican pizza is delicious  but after the service we had here I'm sad to say we will not be returning. Horrible service they were rude, did not refill our drinks or waters. Good took forever to arrive and was like warm at best... so disappointed"}
{"text":"Good - bueno..  That's about it - went here with the family last month and we all enjoyed our meal. Only problem is I can't remember what I had....  So, yes I was satisfied and would return, but I can probably think of a dozen more places I would go to for authentic mexican food first.  I don't believe you will hate it but, you probably will not do back flips in the parking lot either!"}
{"text":"Our family loves Carlos obriens and has been many times over the years for occasions (at the old location). First time visiting the new location and the service was  absolutely terrible.   As a party of 10 we were seated and waited 10+ minutes with zero acknowledgement. The busser came by to clean the table from the previous guests and we had to ask him to grab a server. Not that the server helped much. Terrible attitude and she seemed put out to be helping us. The server was rude all night and came over maybe a handful of times, we were celebrating after each visit from her. Drinks (waters) and chips sat empty for most the visit. Countless staff members walked by our table with no efforts to serve.  Hopefully this is a one time thing, and we will be back again, but extremely disappointed in the service."}
{"text":"Not a very good lunch...this is not a great mexican restaurant, but It looks way different than it was when this was the Elephant Bar. The dining room is too crowded though and looks more like a convention floor rather than a restaurant.   1. Cheese Crisp - not enough cheese and served with no condiments - $3.95 2. Two tacos - too much cheese and the shredded beef was inedible. The machaca meat was only slightly better. $7.50 3. Chips and salsa - nothing wrong here.  free 4. Pollo Fundido - unusual, was not enjoyed by fellow diner. 5. Side of Sour cream that should have come with Crisp was $1.50 6. Lunch specials - not everything is on special, just the usual gringo plates.  You will walk out feeling greasy and cheesy. Not the Mexican lunch I had in mind. Adios."}
{"text":"Alejandro is a great server. He always takes care of my family when we come in. He makes the dinner enjoyable and fun"}
{"text":"Simply the BEST Mexican food restaurant I've found. I've been an enthusiastic customer for decades & their quality has never faltered. Carlos O'Brien's is our favorite restaurant for family get-togethers, entertaining guests and celebrations. The menu is diverse; something for everyone, the service is great; never a complaint."}
{"text":"OMG, they can't even get the chip right here. Came here with 4 people . Got two bowls and they were soggy. Our meals came out at different times and our food got cold waiting for the last dish. Waited for a long time to get a drink refill. The fish tacos were burned and greasy.  I only ate enough to get rid of my hunger pains. The server asked if  I wanted a to go box....no we left a lot of food on the table. There are way better places than this to go eat at. I am done eating here."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and come here often. It's always good food and good service. Today was no different. Thank you Adrian our waiter tonight who was very attentive making sure I didn't have any death tomatoes on my food."}
{"text":"First of all, I know what Carlos O'Brien's is.  It's an Americanized Mexican place with chimichangas and such.  Being in town visiting family, someone chose this place for a group dinner.  It wasn't me.  I vaguely remembered liking it as a child and ignored the Yelp reviews.  The menu was typical Arizona Mexican food (the Carlos) and \"pub\" food (the O'Brien)  I had no expectation of authenticity or gourmet ingredients.    The space is huge and it was fairly busy but not packed.  The decor is straight out of 1980, which actually was a bit charming.  Our server was personable and did a great job. The food was TERRIBLE.  I mean really awful. The hot salsa tasted of nothing but ground chiles and the mild salsa was worse than bottled grocery store stuff and just tasted like sugar and tomatoes.  The chips were good, but with nothing good to put on them it didn't really matter.  My food was beyond bland, and everyone agreed.  We dumped the hot salsa on everything to even make it palatable. I think we had a total of eight different dishes and nobody liked any of them except the cheese crisp (and one person didn't even like that).  My margarita was terrible, tasted like straight from the plastic bottle margarita mix and had very little alcohol and almost no salt.  There is no way I would come here again or recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I love Carlos O'Briens.  We've been going here since the 16th St. & Bethany Home location!  When the location closed at Bell and Scottsdale, we were bummed.  Then we heard about the new location at Mayo and 101.  Woo Hoo!  However, the aesthetics in this location are HORRIBLE.  We were seated on the \"stage\" and it was so loud that we could barely hear each other across the table.  It seemed they were short staffed as the tables took a while to get cleaned and getting more chips was a chore.    Hopefully they will work out the kinks."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh.  We left ASU in 1971 and have become a custom to Ohio Mexican.  Today was the best we have had anywhere in Ohio and I hate to say this but it tops all of the valley.  Loved #9 and the maragritas too!  I WILL BE BACK SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE RETURNING TO OHIO.  If you decide to go, please don't take all the seats."}
{"text":"So we went to Carlos O'Brians for lunch today. I have been coming here for about 30-35 years, so for the most part it's good. If it's not good, they'll fix it! I keep coming because I love their food \"most of the time\", but other times, not so much! It just depends on who's cooking! Today, I decided to order the poyo fondito(can't spell it) I took a bite and there was barely any cream cheese and hardly any shredded cheese melted on top and the chicken inside was very dry, so I asked the lady for more cream cheese & melted shredded cheese. She brought me back a bowel of orange marshmellowey looking stuff. At first I was like, eww gross, but then I tasted it and it was actually good. So I lathered up my burito and gained an extra 5 pounds, LMAO, Just kidding! Seriously though, it did take care of that dry chicken. So I guess you just gotta know how to fix your food when it doesn't taste right, right?"}
{"text":"We like this place cuz it's down the street from my fam's house and they have a party-like atmosphere.  Nice bar with some tvs to watch the game.  The food is decent, the portions are HUGE and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"Went to the Avondale location and we had pollo fundido and the spinich enchilada.  Food and drinks were really good and service was great!"}
{"text":"I live in Michigan and never leave town whenever I'm  here if at all possible without getting here.I  had the fajita quesadilla tonight and it was fantastic. They also have fabulous fried icecream. Portion sizes are huge and its so reasonably priced. Service was excellent. Thank you Joseph. Jighly recommend even for large groups or families"}
{"text":"This is not the place it used to be.  We ordered a cheese crisp and it came out limp and not very hot.  Waitress had another cooked and this time the bottom layer tasted like a cracker.  So disappointed.  Next we had the queso dip which was amazing. Portion was just smaller.  Chips were also amazing. Then to our favorite Pollo Fundido.  And the shells were dark brown and over cooked.  Used to have a wonderful cream cheese on top with cheese and that was even just a little.  Inside was dry.  So disappointing.  We have been going here for 30 years and now I am not sure we will every go back.  Not sure what they did to the food that used to be so great!11"}
{"text":"My wife and I love Carlos O'Briens. We go there at least once a week, all the way from Chandler. We sit in the bar area and always have great service from Sean, Christian, Ivan and sometimes we get Kaitlin who is great as well. Margaritas are superb, chips are hot and tasty, and all the food is well prepared and tasty. Love the new digs. Much nicer than the old location."}
{"text":"I am a gluten free girl living in a wheatly wonderland! However, Mexican food can be hit or miss and today it was a hit! Came to Carlos O'Briens for the first time. The service was speedy, which was great because we were boppin' around tonight. The GF spinach enchalada was so good...it was my gooey splurge for the week. Its covered in spinach and queso. Their menu is clearly marked with my favorite moniker (GF) so I can choose well. The margarita was potent, the music was fun, and the Blackhawk game was on in the patio area...makes me a happy girl!"}
{"text":"DJ our server was 5 star! The food was good too, but the five stars are more for this service. We ordered Mexican pizza, fajitas, gauc, and spinach dip.  Food was ok- service made up for some of it"}
{"text":"Food was great, loved it. Service was excruciatingly slow. When the food finally did arrive, we had no silverware and that took another 10 minutes to get. Nothing like staring down your hot plate of food that you waited a half hour for, only to be foiled because no fork!  Great food though, tough night for our server."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for over 15 years is a wonderful Mexican restaurant the food is very good and the price is incredible and their plates are enormous."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for years and I hope in my lifetime this place doesn't go away.  The food is fantastic and have never had bad service.  The hostesses are courteous and pleasant.  For anyone coming from out if town, I recommend this place and I will continue to frequent this eatery."}
{"text":"This is the worst Mexican food in Phoenix! We used to go as kids when Jordan's and Carlos was good but now there are way too many amazing places to eat. When I see the parking lot I think either everyone in there is from out of town or have awful taste in Mex food. The chips and salsa are alright but how can you screw up beans they made all of us sick twice and taste so bad possibly out of a can not sure ? Just at a party last night where everyone voted it to be the worst along with Jordan's how do they stay open??"}
{"text":"I had dinner with a girl friend here a few weeks ago. Carlos O'Brien is a chain restaurant we decided to go to since we were in the area. We visited the scottsdale location. The restaurant offers a wide range of mexican cuisine. They give a generous amount of food with each plate. Chips and 2 types of salsa is served as an apetizer. The food was good but not impressive. We were seated fairly quickly even if the restaurant was busy when we arrived. We noticed that not all waiters spoke English, however with our beginners Spanish skills, we were able to communicate just fine   Overall a good time here. I would go back."}
{"text":"Very average food at best getting me in trouble with my girlfriend due to food quality"}
{"text":"I grew up eating at this place, going back to the days when it was on the corner of 16th and Bethany in the spot where TexAz is today.  I would say that this place is very dependable.  The food is solid, and it's a steal.  I had a machaca burro enchilada style with an iced tea, and it set me back about $10.  It is a real Phoenix institution."}
{"text":"Growing up in AZ, you come to have a love for Mexican food. I Love fresh Mexican food, and this place has it!  My family and I have been coming here for years and nothing has changed. The service is great, the manager Ken is very friendly and welcoming every time you come through the door.  The plates of food come out with enough to take home for leftovers, so to enjoy again! Since the pates are so big, it fattens your waistline! I order a pitcher of the top shelf margaritas every time and boy do they have a good amount of tequila in it!  The fajita grilled cheese is stuffed with bell peppers and strips of either steak or chicken and plenty of cheese. I usually order the chicken chimi, which is stuffed with shredded chicken a side of sour cream, and the fixings of tomatoes, lettuce, beans and Spanish rice.   Order the fried ice cream and it complements your whole meal! It is a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream rolled in browned corn flakes and then topped with honey and chocolate syrup.  A great atmosphere and family restaurant  ."}
{"text":"went there a couple of years ago and were very disappointed in the food and the service (dining room).  gave it another chance the other night because I was craving flan and the reviews were good....worst flan I ever had! and the service is still bad (bar).  Just because it's cheap and the portions are big doesn't mean it's good...quite the opposite."}
{"text":"Clean fast service. A hidden  restaurant in the center. Lots of families eating the night we visited."}
{"text":"Always good and consistent for years.  Huge portions at great prices."}
{"text":"We liked this place on Bell and like it here. The food seems the same. The new space seems bigger and better. Service was great. It is an excellent place for lunch. There are many more authentic places no doubt but this works for us. I had a super burrito which I have always liked. My wife believes the pollo fundido is the best. The margaritas are good though not great.  I suppose with top shelf tequila and hand assembled ingredients they would be better but more expensive. Chips are healthier, that is unsalted which is not a plus in my book."}
{"text":"Okay, the food is not the BEST mexican food in the world.  But sit in the bar area, it is real cozy with a nice authentic vibe.  Just good people having a good time.  No meat market here or anything.  Chips and salsa are good, but again, not the best.  Staff is awesome and they will really take care of you.  Ask for \"Jose\" - he will take care of you.  Tell him attorney steve sent you.  When he looks at you funny, just ask him for some hornitos!"}
{"text":"Great Restaurant! Large Portions and good food."}
{"text":"A family tradition the past 6 years. My favorite is the Carlos Carnitas Dinner. My wife likes the Little Bit of everything Plate. They have Happy Hour as well and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"So after boycotting the Carlos O'Brians location for the last year, I went to the location on Happy Valley Rd for lunch. I will say that my experience this time was much better. The food was average, but it was filling. Overall food presentation was much better than my last visit. The guy that brought the chips to the table was friendly and attentive. My server was fast, friendly, and knowledgeable. She kept up with drink refills which was a plus."}
{"text":"I was a huge fan of Carlo's O'Briens. I have been dining here for years.  It definitely has gone down hill over the years. We had a reservation yet they were seating walk ins first.  We got to our table and there was trash everywhere, chips on the floor, salsa on the table which the hostess wiped with her hand, trash all around the busing station. If you have ever been to a restaurant that has saw dust on the floor I would say the same here except chips on the floor. The waiter was pleasant and did the best he can.  We ordered appetizer and when he gave me the plates I started to serve the appetizer to my family I picked up a plate and in between the plates was salsa they were dirty!!! I ordered the fajitas' and asked for all rice no beans yet we got all beans no rice? My son ordered the chicken burrito and it had bones in it which is very dangerous, luckily he didn't choke on the bones.  When I told the waiter he didn't seem concerned.    Still the best salsa in town but too dirty for us."}
{"text":"I can't say enough how much I love this place.    The food is soooo good and sooo offordable.  The portions are huge for the price.   Which means , left overs for days.   And it reheats awesome too.    Sandra and Shawn and Christian in the bar are FABULOUS.     Sat in the dining room for once today and Heidi was our waitress.   She was a 10/10 as well.   I go out to eat often and really appreciate good, attentive , personal service.    If you're craving delicious Mexican with some great (cheap) margs and top notch service....   This is your place !!!"}
{"text":"Service was ok,, food was nasty.... tacos got me sick and the meat was cold,,,,  place was nice and clean inside just would rather eat a taco from a food stand then ever go there again....."}
{"text":"Called in a catering order for my son's birthday party. Couldn't have been easier. Dave took my order and was very thorough to ensure I understood exactly what was included and how it would be delivered. He called on the day to confirm details and arrived right on time. I couldn't have asked for better service.    The food was good, too. We had mini tacos, flautas, plus green corn tamales and pollo fundido. Everything was hot, flavorful. Came with generous amounts of chips, salsa, rice and beans. I ordered black beans instead of refried and they were awesome, too! I ordered a bit extra and my family loved taking home some leftovers.    I considered a couple of different options for Mexican food catering and prices were pretty comparable. So glad I chose Carlos, as the food and service were terrific.  Dinner was just as good as when we visit the restaurant -- YUM!"}
{"text":"Really nothing special about their food. Best way to describe the food is \"ordinary\". There were 6 of us and each commented that the food was just \"OK\". Place is huge and the atmosphere is pleasant. Service was fine. Worth trying for you Mexican food fans. Perhaps you will find something to enjoy."}
{"text":"I come to Carlos O'Briens periodically - maybe annually, sometimes more, sometimes less. It's a good restaurant. The food is good (not incredible, but a solid good) with large portions (I never finishe a meal). Very American style rather than traditional food with the typical dishes - tacos, enchiladas, chimichangas, etc. They go heavy on the cheese - it doesn't bother me, but it has bothered folks I have gone with. Otherwise, it is good food I am glad to eat.   The service was incredibly fast. Tonight, a Friday evening, they were packed, yet we ordered, ate and chatted, and were out the door in less than 40 minutes. Staffers were there whenever my glass was low, but weren't in our faces all the time.   The prices are medium - you're looking at $10-20 per person depending on what you order.    The restaurant itself is pretty decent. The decor is pretty American Mexi-style, with obligatory bright colors and wood furniture. It's not a quiet place, but it isn't real loud - just active.   Short story is, I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but am perfectly happy to stop in."}
{"text":"Bored?  Got a couple of extra minutes on your hands between Facebook and Instagram?  Type \"cheap Mexican food\" into Yelp and see how many pages come up. I'll save you the time and trouble, a lot.  One of the great things about living here in Phoenix, besides the 358.5 days of sunshine is a multitude of Mexican restaurants.  Most of them very good, depending on what you're looking for.  I had the pleasure of having a Carlos O'Brien's in the same parking lot (on Bell) as my long-term stay hotel when I moved to Phoenix back in '99.  To say I have a soft spot in my heart for them would be an understand.  I also frequent the one on Northern and 13th St. Soft heart but truly love their food.  This is very good food, I usually eat here at least twice a month for lunch, sometimes more.  I try to get the same awesome waitress, nice lady with blond hair that always remembers what I order-so I try to trip her up, she has a great sense of humor.     Lunch menu has six or seven items on it, most with rice and beans which I highly recommend.  These are big lunches, not really \"lunch\" size portions.  I've seen reviews that say the food is not the spiciest and I'd have to agree, just get an extra portion of their hot salsa that comes with the chips and you're set!  I've had the taco salad, pollo fundido, tacos, enchiladas, etc. all of it good and accurately priced.    One of my go-to Mexican restaurants. They'll never win a James Beard award but it won't stop me from eating here."}
{"text":"The food here gives a whole new meaning to the word bland.  That makes this an ok place because most anybody could eat what they serve without any complaints.  It is a good place to take a family or for a big eater.  You get food and lots of it.  It kind of makes me think of pigs when you see them at a feeding trough.  What they get may not be good, but they walk away full, happy piggys.  Carlos O'briens sends out lots of happy oinkers!  Did you pick up on the subtle hint that this may not be the place for those who are looking for something special when they want to have Mexican food?  I hope (lol).  I debated on two or three stars.  I wouldn't go back there myself-two stars.  If I had a family to feed or people from out of town who don't need to be impressed-three stars.  I'd rather be positive than negative so they get three."}
{"text":"We were so impressed with the level of service and food for the price. 4 of us ate and drank until we couldn't move and the bill was under $100. An incredible value! Our server, Tadeo, was one for the books. He knew everything about the menu, gave us great recommendations, and entertained us with his hilarious stories and jokes. The decor of the restaurant is very cool and welcoming. It felt so high end throughout the entire experience, until we got the wonderfully low bill. The combination platters were the best bang for your buck and let you try many different things. Definitely recommend checking this place out and asking for Tadeo!"}
{"text":"We just had an amazing experience. For a while now I have been looking for a good Mexican restaurant, and I think we finally found our favorite. Me, my husband and my daughter were sit right away and had an amazing waiter named Tario, he was very friendly and made sure we had a great experience."}
{"text":"I would give this place 3.5 stars but the service was really nice so I bumped it up to 4.  Both our meals were solid, my wife got the fajitas and I got the Pollo Fundido.  We showed up around 3:30 so it was kind of in between dinner and lunch, and I'm really glad that I opted for the lunch portion on mine as it was very rich and I couldn't even finish the whole thing.  My wife said that her fajitas were good, but not the best she's ever had.  I really liked that they had 2 types of salsa with their chips, and both were really good.  Service was very nice as stated earlier."}
{"text":"Love Love the service, atmosphere and food.  I am so glad they re-opened at this new location. They make the best shredded beef quesadilla, enchilada style with red sauce, ever!! I have ordered it every time I go and now all my friends order it too. The Jean special! They should have it on the menu . Inexpensive and great food! Make sure you say hi to Christian and his brother in the bar!"}
{"text":"The fajitas were fantastic. We ordered the steak and shrimp and they were HUGE. Great portions. Fair price. I'll be back."}
{"text":"My friend introduced this place to me.  The service is hit and miss though.  This place is super casual family restaurant and but of course there is a bar side with tv screens for the customers that want to get liquored up with their chips and salsa. What I usually order is off their \"healthy selections\" menu which is kinda nuts since I usually order the chili con queso dip as an appetizer.  It's super fattening.  I feel guilty even ordering it but it's so good.  The healthy dish i usually get is the poquito carne asada w/ brown rice and wheat tortilla.  But who am i kidding?  i always have to have the chips and salsa and hot sauce.  Love their hot sauce.  Sometimes I order the queso fondido which i refer to as the \"heart attack on a plate\" because it's a deepfried chicken chimichanga smothered with cream cheese and then melted jack and cheaddar cheese on top of that.  Can you say heart attack?  It's really yummy but not so great for you.  I've also had the fried ice cream there too and it's hit and miss.  sometimes it turns out good and sometimes it's kinda soupy which is not so good."}
{"text":"This is an old Phoenix stand by and the portions are huge. I have been ordering the machaca chimi for at least 30 years, it's still wonderful.  The tacos are still the best in Phoenix because they are filled with so much meat, cheese, lettuce and tomatoes.  My favorite menu item is still the chili conqueso. Don't fill up on chips without ordering some."}
{"text":"I love Yelp cause I can share my many experiences with you and the world. So today, in desperate need of a margarita, I decided to stop here with a couple of friends for a pitcher and some guacamole. After a few margaritas, I found their \"healthy\" menu and decided to order their  \"vegan\" veggie burrito. Problem was there was nothing vegan about it. After several bites of the burrito, I found a large piece of burnt steak inside. NASTY! If that wasn't enough, after consuming nearly half of the black beans it was served with, I found pieces of pork in the beans. That explains why they were so salty. I presented all of this to the manager who was kind enough to take most of everything, minus the booze, off of the bill. Revolting."}
{"text":"Wife and I went there for the first time.  I was suprised at the size of the place and at how modern and nice the atmosphere is. Our waiter, Daniel, was very personable and offered suggestions to my wife as to the chili sauce that was served with her meal.  She was a bit timid about things spicy and when she heard Jalopenos she veered away.  With a little coaxing though she tried it and then ate it all. She had a pork burrito which she gave a 4 star to.  I had a pollo fundido  which was good and certainly had a LOT of chicken in it.  I'd give mine four stars also  because I'm a pushover ofr lots of melted cheese. As mentioned before, the wait staff was very good.  Daniel really knew the menu and shared it with us. Will come again."}
{"text":"This place is nothing special.  The food was good, but not great.  The service was fast and friendly, but again the food was nothing worth going back for.  I don't even remember what it is that I ate, so that in itself should tell you something about the place.  Or does that tell you something about me?  Yes, I am getting old, but I can remember when something is worth having again!"}
{"text":"I was visiting the Phoenix area on business and tried out Carlos O'Brien's, which really doesn't sound like a Mexican restaurant.   The food and service were both excellent. And the portions were enough to fill me up after a full of activity. The salmon was well done, as were the beans and rice.  If I ever visit Arizona again I will definitely make a stop at Carlos O'Brien's."}
{"text":"I think the owners must take the Yelp reviews seriously, because I visited this new Carlos O'Briens location for dinner recently and had an excellent experience.  We were greeted right away in a friendly manner by the hostess at the front desk. She seated us and within 10 - 15 seconds, a friendly wait staff member brought chips and salsa to the table. The waitress greeted us about 20 seconds later and took our drink orders. Staff members worked together to keep our beverages filled. Several staff members offered more chips and salsa to us, but we declined, knowing that the entree portions are huge.  The combination plates were large and satisfying (especially the tacos). The shrimp fajita platter was huge and delicious. The menu is large enough to satisfy most everyone. They even have non-Mexican food items if you are in the mood for pub food.  The only complaints I would have was my rice was clumpy in spots. Also, while the tables were cleared off quickly, there was a bit of trash on the floor here and there throughout the restaurant.  This location is quite a bit noisier than the old Scottsdale/Bell Road location, but the noise wasn't overpowering. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Ordered for take out this time and was really really disappointed this time. There was no chili, cheese, or lettuce tomato on my burrito. Was bland and unseasoned same with the taco. I hope this is not the way it is now. Maybe it was just the take out and we didnt dine in this time. Didn't eat the tostada yet but I hope it is better than the rest of our dinner. Lots of cumin in wife's beef burrito. After reading reviews looks like maybe they changed cooks about a year ago. Hope they realize before they lose all business."}
{"text":"I made a reservation on open table when I arrived for my reservation I was told it could not be honored by the hostess. She said it would not be fair to the people on there wait list. I tried to explain that a reservation pushes you in front of people waiting but she would not listen. I asked for a manager and she said she was busy. There food is good but the hostess  need to be trained better!"}
{"text":"Been going here for years but I find myself enjoying the quality of food less and less. Went to the new location tonight and it is a beautiful restaurant. Here's my breakdown  Pros Server was friendly and attentive  Refills of salsa were consistent and before we had to ask Large portions Bar seating allows full menu Service Fun, cheerful atmosphere  Cons Chips are bland and flavorless Food is drowning in cheese-so much so that it \"Americanizes\" the dish  Flavors are bland and cheesy Cheese Crisp is cheese melted on a tortilla. So many places crisp them and they are so much better Spanish rice was gummy and flavorless"}
{"text":"First, go here with the intention of eating a lot! Portions are large!  Service: excellent, the young servers were very attentive and hard working Food: CHEESY!! The #13 (little bit of everything) was amazing specifically the tamale...mm! The Chicken enchilada and taco were loaded with chicken if you like meat! Personally, I liked the shredded beef more. Ambiance: this is where this rating isn't a 5 star. The layout is exactly the same as Compound Grill and doesn't have that homey feel. I would recommend adding some color and more culture!  Prices: entrees are reasonable, however appetizers are a little pricey (guac $7). The skinny margarita is excellent if you don't like sweet drinks. My husband ordered Cadillac and he rated it 8/10.  Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"The new location opened up 2 weeks ago and they still have a lot of issues to work through.  The microphones weren't working to notify people that they are ready to seat you, the wait times were way off as they told us 30 min and it took nearly 50 min.  The server who was employed with them for over 10 years was over worked.  She wasn't attentive, never came back to our table once we were served until finally we flagged her down for more water and tortillas.   Although after asking she never showed up with the request.  Finally she came back to drop the check and we asked her for the tortillas again and she slammed her hand on the table and took off.  She came back but dropped to go boxes at the same time as the check but we were not done eating.  We provided some constructive criticism to the manager who apologized and took 50% off our bill.  The food was excellent as always but the service struggled.  The new location is smaller than the old location as they have less tables.  The manager stated that the computers have glitches and the bussers are all new but the kitchen and servers followed them.  The atmosphere is loud as there is no fabric or carpet throughout its all wood and echoes.  So if you want a quiet dinner or want to hear the people at your table forget it.  They were very crowded and obviously were not ready."}
{"text":"Two words: Pollo fundido!! So yummy. Quick service. One negative- Pepsi product (yuck!) Everyone knows good Mexican food tastes 10X better with a Coke!"}
{"text":"I've been twice now. .once at lunch and once at happy hour. ..service is terrible. At 1130 we waited for 10 min before being acknowledged and brought to a take. Hh we waited for drinks we waited for food."}
{"text":"Great place to enjoy good food and relaxing atmosphere.  Bring the family and have a great time"}
{"text":"The new location was very pretty, but that's where it ended. Hostess wasn't very friendly. Table was wet when  we were seated. Food was mediocre at best. My husband ordered a plain burrito, meat only. It came out with cheese. The waiter couldn't understand why that would be a problem. Turns out my husband doesn't like cheese, but there are lots of people that can't eat cheese. It shouldn't have been an issue and he shouldn't have had to explain why he didn't care to eat it. My enchiladas came out in an unappealing watery sauce. Service was incredibly slow and getting beverage refills was a hassle as we had to chase down the staff. Won't be going back!"}
{"text":"Came here with couple of friends. FISH TACOS had way too much cabbage and you could call it cabbage tacos. Chips and salsa was also not great."}
{"text":"LOVE this place~~! Great food + prompt service.  If you are looking for quality + quantity, this place is for you.  I been coming to this place since 01 and just fell in love with the food.  Highly recommended~!!"}
{"text":"Fancy place in a kinda odd or rough neighborhood.  Prices are ok, not too hight and not cheap. Food good..."}
{"text":"You like Chips and Salsa? You like a family restaurant? You like a clean bar scene? Well this is the Mexican restaurant to try. Opened forever they have drawn families and foodies for years. They have an authentic menu with a variety of options for all Mexican food lovers to try. My favorite is there Fajitas or the Carna Asada. This is a kids friendly restaurant."}
{"text":"3.5 stars actually. This location is HUGE! I mean HUGE! The area that we were in for my friend's party held a good 60+ of us with no problem. Although the service was great and the food was ok but the lighting was terrible. That was my only gripe. Where the food was set up for the party, was not in a well lit area at all. Could you see? Yes but it was VERY dark compared to not only the rest of the restaurant but even the area where we could sit and mingle. If they would have set this up in a different area, then I could easily give this a good solid 4 stars.. All in all great service considering it was a party of 60+."}
{"text":"My husband took me to dinner here once. For such a big venue it was extremely empty.  Once the food arrived I knew why. The food was so bland. I could have made dinner that night for way cheaper."}
{"text":"The food and staff are always very good. I order something I did not like and they took it back and got me something different. They were very apologetic management came over asked if he could sit down and and talk to me about the issue wrote down why I did not like the meal after I got my new food came back again and made sure I was happy with it and bought me a desert. Outstanding service. Will be back"}
{"text":"So happy they reopened! Was there on opening night and the food was still outstanding! Love the flautas!"}
{"text":"Having had eaten here countless times, I'm surprised I haven't written a review! I lived across the street from here and easily walked here 20 times in the last two years. I love the Chile con carne and the carnitas! So . . . I'm basically a fan of their meat! I've eaten other things here, but those were my most commonly ordered items. The open faced quesadilla (that's fancy talk for a cheese crisp) is mighty delicious too! The bartenders are friendly. I'd only complain that they aren't open later - but the crowd certainly doesn't support the later hours, so I get it."}
{"text":"Love this place!! This restaurant has been part of my family's Sunday lunch tradition for years!! The chips and salsa are amazing! I could come and just fill up on those (and I have)!   The service is super friendly and fast! I've never been disappointed with anything I've tried. I love their chimi con queso, I get it with beef instead of chicken. I also love their shrimp plate and their chimichangas. I've also been impressed with their shrimp enchilada. My mom and sister love their fish tacos while my other sister gets their green corn tamale. Just writing this review has me drooling!"}
{"text":"One of my partners, his wife and my super lovely wife came here for dinner. We had high hopes, but were disappointed by the food quality and the service. We ended up being with a new server who wasn't up to the task of the super fast paced environment of this restaurant. it wa a saturday during dinner, not a good time to cut our teeth. We were left alone for 10s of minutes at a time. Our water glasses were never refilled. The food was just ok. Not that flavorful. the chips and salsa were very good. The queso was VERY salty. The entrees were just fair. Nothing stood out and like I said the service wa poor.   We really wanted to like this place as it is close to us, but sadly it was not."}
{"text":"Great food. Been a while since was there still the same great taste. Loved it. Had couple night on Cinco de Mayo."}
{"text":"Just left, didn't get waited on after 15 minutes of being in the bar area. Bartender/server saw me standing at end of the bar, ignored me, served 2 men that were there at least 10 minutes after we walked in."}
{"text":"Our family stopped by the new location this last Sunday evening and had the best time chatting with the staff and the owner, Dave even stopped by to give us a personal hello. The dinner was delicious-I am a bit of a snacker so I had the taco topped with sliced avocado and my husband had a HUGE portion of fajitas and the cookie ice cream dessert was devoured by our 6 year old in about 2 seconds flat...over all fantastic food and service. Thank you for your hospitality!! We are looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Has been years that haven't been there and I am still pissed at how poorly we were treated there. Maybe it has changed but I will never step foot there ever again. Food was OK I guess but the service was horrible. If you like your food to be thrown in your face by the waitress and you have to clean up HER mess, you should go there. Oh, and bring your own utensils since they don't seem to be willing to provide them. The manager couldn't have cared less, the staff just seemed to be going thru the motions. Horrible experience."}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about. Salsa, beans and enchilada was ok at best. The fajitas were AWFUL I sent them back, I had a combo and the chicken was inedible. The peppers weren't even cooked and the tortillas were rock hard. I got a chicken enchilada in place of it. They were alright.. def not worth the price. Our waitress DIDN'T care that I wasn't enjoying my meal she barely made eye contact. My husband and I agree we don't remember them being this awful and we won't be back."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre. Enchilada sauce is tasteless. I had to doctor it with hot sauce. I've eaten better food at a 'Berto's. This last visit, the service was horrible. My food arrived ice cold, but the plate was very hot. Strange. I'm glad my family celebrates here only once a year. Next time, I will eat BEFORE I go here."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Service was mediocre. The original Carlos O'briens on Northern is much better."}
{"text":"First time here, and it was pretty good!  I had the chimi plate and it was hot and tasty and cooked right.  The salsa is really good too, and the chips were warm and fresh.  Will go back!"}
{"text":"Pollo fundido was delicious !! One of the best I've had. Wish I would have taken a picture before I ate it. Lots of seating, big restaurant, great service."}
{"text":"would be a 5 star if this was review was soley based on their $3.50 margarita happy hour specials! Pretty good prickly pear margaritas however a tad \"syrupy\" for me. The mexican pizza is enough to feed an army....seriously not your Taco Bell small pizzas by any stretch of the imagination!! Good chips and salsa with a bite!"}
{"text":"Two words: CHEESE CRISP.  Not a quesadilla. A cheese crisp.  Back in the day, this was a part of growing up. Every Mexican restaurant had one. Your mom would make them. It's simple: you take a tortilla, cover it in cheese, top it with green chile, and let it crisp up under the broiler. Pure cheesy simplicity with the bite of warm chile. It's perfection.  Somewhere along the way this got turned into a quesadilla, a folded tortilla with cheese and usually some meat that's slapped into a sandwich press and served with a side of salsa and sour cream. (Which is nothing like a quesadilla in Mexico, which is more along the lines of a taco with melted cheese, but I digress.) While Taco Bell proved that you can turn this into something you can eat while you're driving, it's nothing like an old school cheese crisp, and you rarely see them on restaurant menus anymore.  Carlos O 'Brien's hasn't forgotten me as a small child in the 1970's and they still make the best cheese crisp ever, with your choice of either diced green chile or green chile strips. Order several for the table and thank me later. Also, catch them at lunch, because they do mini cheese crisps for $3 and they have a fantastic burrito enchilada style on the lunch menu, too.  When I taste one at Carlos O'Brien's I think of my mom making them for me and me trying to make them without burning them. I can't think of higher praise than a restaurant triggering memories like that. Go eat one and see what you remember."}
{"text":"*Plenty of parking* I do not know why I have never really liked this location. Everything usually is average, from service to food to building, etc. We ended up here and the food was OK for my hubby, he got the Pollo Fundido. I got the chile con carne bowl (red) and it had waaaay to much cumin for my taste. I always order that at the Scottsdale 101 location and it has been perfect there. We also had the chile con queso, hubby liked it more than me, I did not like the texture, it was like grainy. Pedro was our server and he did all the things a server is expected to do, so he did his job, was professional, got us frequent refills, etc... Overall, yeah, we may come back if it is on the way or we are nearby, but if I can choose I will go to the 101 location instead."}
{"text":"I guess we were always here for dinner in the past. Stopped by for an early dinner recently and found out their lunch menu is good until 5pm! (M-F), and until 3pm on Sat, Sun and holidays. That was such a nice surprise! They open at 10am and this is a good location to visit if you have to fast for tests at Mayo Clinic.  I had my favorite the red chile beef, in a burrito this time."}
{"text":"No bad, not outstanding, good solid Mexican.  Nothing to complain about. Service a little slow but no big deal.  We Had Pollo Fundido, Shrimp Enchalada with tomatillo jalapeño cream cheese sauce, machaca quesadilla, tomatillo chicken enchilada. All good and what you expected. Started with some queso, chips and salsa. Nice starter. Portions were big, nobody finished. Good family place.  Needs some decor upgrades, very old"}
{"text":"I love the Arizona-Sonoran style food (especially Botanas) and friendliness at Carlos O'Brien's on Northern so much that I hold my semi-annual VIP Customer event there.  While service has always been adequate, I had an exceptional experience on June 20, 2016 when Daisy was my server and seemed to anticipate our every need.  I was even more pleased when our eager busboy, Pablo, was super helpful far above simple refills and cleanup.  He even picked up my heavy things and carried them to my car for me. I don't know if Carlos O'Briens lucked out and found two service jewels or are now training their serving employees better---my experience on 6/20/2016: the service is as great as the food!"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican place in Phoenix.   The spinach dip is awesome.   I usually get the \"little bit of everything\"  It is so amazing."}
{"text":"They have Good food, huge portions ( the fajitas literally last me 2-3 meals) , super nice servers and quick service ! I highly recommend this restaurant. I live within walking distance of this place"}
{"text":"Me and my wife heard good things about this place. Boy!!! none of it was true. Service was extremely slow. My wife's fish taco fell apart and she couldn't even eat it, because the tortilla was soggy.   My kids had French fries delivered to them late, so they were upset they had to 10 long minutes just to get fries after our food was delivered.   My fajitas were delicious, and my mother had the the chimichanga. We enjoyed our food, but we wouldn't return and I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.   Also, bill was extremely high for 5 people, 2 of which ordered french fries only. Two thumbs down"}
{"text":"I found this place to be a decent Mexican restaurant. The decor threw me off a bit as the outside looks like a tavern, yet the inside has some weird modern vibe. Can't put my name on it but was cool never the less.  Honestly, I wouldn't have thought this was a Mexican place due to the \"O' Brian\" clueing it up as am Irish pub, if it wasn't for my dad bringing home leftovers of Mexican food pine day.  I love chips and salsa so there's that. Hard to screw that up and they are the thin and crispy chips.  They have very generous portions as well. I ordered the chicken taco and chicken enchilada plate. I could only get through the taco. Their chicken was flavorful and not bland. My mini tried a bit of the enchilada and surprisingly actually liked it - he's very much a bean burrito kind of kid. Which is what I ordered him. We both tom food home and left satisfied."}
{"text":"Was introduced to this restaurant and surprisingly I was very pleased! I am originally from El Paso, TX which is 5 minutes from Juarez Mexico so I am use to authentic Mexican food. I've been here for 10years and gave up on finding good Mexican food here in Arizona. I think I've been to most places all over the Valley and only found one resturant that was good. Now I have found another! Look forward to coming back here! I would post a picture but it did not make it to camera roll. Lol!"}
{"text":"Went to the new Mayo location.  Food and service were very good.   I really don't like the fact that they left the entire restaurant part open with a cafeteria like feel.  The raised stages were left in place.  No dividers between any of the tables, way too open, not at all warm or cozy.  If you look around, you do not get the feel of a Mexican restaurant, very bare and plain Jane.  If you are looking for the typical, average Mexican food without any ambiance or association with being in a Mexican food restaurant, well enjoy..."}
{"text":"I had some of their food for take out last night, but I've been going to this place since I was a baby. Staff isn't very friendly these days, but the food is always worth it. I personally recommend the beef tacos, cheese and chicken enchiladas, chicken chimichanga, and red chile burro enchilada style. I like my dishes with red sauce. Also, the chips and salsa are so addicting! You will never walk away without a full stomach from this place!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I both grew up eating here on the regular with our families and still go for dates.  Wonderful servers that feel like friends and take good care of you!  Food is great starting with the chips, salsa and cheese crisp to the main meal!  A ton of food and always delicious!  Works well for large groups, celebrating a birthday or watching the big game!  Also great for catering!"}
{"text":"This food was so bad  and they were so expensive   i had Pollo Fundido  it was so dry and the the rice was so dry  Mexican is favorite of all favorites  but this place is real bad  wont eat here again  :P"}
{"text":"With an Irish Mexican name like Carlos O'Brien's, you really never know what you are getting yourself into.  After trying to find some good queso in the Valley with very little success, I finally found the good stuff at Carlos O'Brien's.  It was delicious.  Apparently queso is not a big thing in the Southwest, but us Texans live for it.    The food and chips and salsa were also very good.  My fajita chicken quesadillas had cheese oozing out of the sides of the tortillas and big fresh peppers.  The margaritas were also quite tasty.  I was so full I felt like I needed my husband to roll me out the door."}
{"text":"This is a old time family fave! Really good Mexican food! Very popular spot and a must try!"}
{"text":"Frequently stop at this location while waiting on traffic to subside. Friendly staff good food and fast service.  I have an allergy to guacamole and they swap it out for sour cream no problem and no extra charge. They even can swap out rice for veggies."}
{"text":"My wife and I will be back. Quality, Quantity, Price and Service were all exceptional! The location is a bit obscure but parking friendly."}
{"text":"Well to say the least the place is dated 80's 90's look. It has a dirty feel to it. As for food... The chips they brought us tasted bland and were t my favorite. The spinach enchiladas was palatable but nothing to write him about. My partner had the Pollo fondido was dry inside and wasn't  fried long enough either as it was mushy.   We won't be back again as there are many other Mexican places that are much better."}
{"text":"I came here with a fairly large party, everything went great.  Wonderful food and wonderful service.  I thought the prices were moderate and the portions were large.  I would return in a heart beat.  They really treated us well.  Good flavor to the salsa!"}
{"text":"So what can I say about COB as I call it? Well, heavenly goodness and joy comes to mind. I am a bit of a fuddyduddy when I go there becuase I love to get the #13 sampler dish. It has a little taste of everything I love at COB's. I love their tortillas, honestly for those I would give up soda for a year just for a batch of those warm desirables. I love the atmosphere and the service has never disappointed me. Every birthday my friend asks me where she can take me and I told her she already knows the answer, COB's. Thanks for being a staple here in Phoenix, you bring joy to so many."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch today with some people from work. I always get excited for COB. We were seated quickly and met Heidi our waitress. She was absolutely fantastic! She took our orders and came back in a very short time with our drinks. It was busy, but she was attentive to all her tables, making sure everyone was cared for. Just a few minutes went by and there was our food order. I usually get the #13, but today I had the machacca beef chimichanga. Unbelievable taste and a gorgeous presentation. I am never disappointed, the other two people I went with couldn't have been happier. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I had a terrible craving for Mexican food the other night, and found myself in this complex doing miscellaneous shopping. So my son and I wandered over to this restaurant, having not been before, just recognizing the name. Walking in, it felt large and clean. It took a while to be seated, and when we did we were put in a corner booth. The waitress was nice, but short with her words. I ordered the chicken chimi with red sauce, and got my son the bean burrito kids meal. Food was just okay. I find myself only coming on here to write so so reviews, and maybe that's not fair as im picky! Probably due to being stuck in a corner booth, the waitress didn't check on us once, and I had to flag her down to get my bill. I suppose if you live in the neighborhood it would be okay to check out, but I wont be back. There are too many other authentic places in town to come here."}
{"text":"Never have I ate so nasty of a dish of Mexican food  out of 3 plates nothing was good chunks of tomatoes in rice , burnt enchiladas and bean burrito that had so much beans you could not even eat. manager was nice that was about it."}
{"text":"Me and my fiance went here for the full meal. We started with fried onions and jalapenos that tastes like fried flour with excess flour. The margaritas had a weird nasty taste to them. Then we got dinner he got the Rueben which was really soggy and soup like over spicy slaw, the meat was way over cooked and the fries were not Cooked well enough at all. I got the #13 and everything was really dry and tasted like crap. We ate over all probably  like a few bites of each thing. It was not good and we will never go back. Taco bell would of been a better choice"}
{"text":"My 3rd time to this company but different location.  I had the Red Chile con carne , the meat was very good and tender with lots of flavor."}
{"text":"meh..food was ok.  wasn't amazing.  tasted like regular chain-restaurant food..like chilis, applebees, etc."}
{"text":"We enjoyed enchilada dinners. The plates were nicely garnished. Chips were hot and salsa & hotter sauce were great.  Our server was quick to notice we needed another Pepsi . She was very nice as well as efficient . Good time!"}
{"text":"Carlos O'Brian's has been a favorite of mine since moving to phoenix. The food is very flavorful, and the portions are large especially for the price. My personal favorite is the Pollo Fundido. It's an explosion of flavor. They also make great margaritas. Another plus is they still give you chips and salsa for pick up orders. Also it's close to the Point Hilton resort, so definately a must visit place for travelers staying in the area look for great Mexican food."}
{"text":"I stopped by tonight for the first time, and sat at the bar for a quick meal.  The bartenders could not have been friendlier.  The entire staff seemed very friendly.  The food was fantastic!  I look forward to going back very soon!"}
{"text":"AMAZING MARGARITAS!!!! I get a strawberry every time, and it never disappoints. Their cheese crisp has spoiled me. No body else has one that compares! I always get the cheese enchiladas, as well, and they are DREAMY. This place is by far one of my favorite spots, and each time I leave I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Was my 1st time at Carlos O'Brien's, it was a friends 40th birthday dinner and this is her favorite place to go. I went with high expectations because she has told me over and over the past few years how good this place is.  I arrived couple minutes after everyone was there and saw that the party (there was about 25 of us) was broken sort of into you, half the party down one side and other wrapped around the middle and the birthday girl was kind of not at either tables, just in the middle of the 2, which made it difficult for conversations to flow, you could talk to your half of the table, but if you want to talk with those on the other side of the restaurant, get up and walk over their then, needless to say, I stayed where I was at and talked amongst my fellow friends on my side, kept giving the bday girl a shout out and drinks to let her know we are here to party!   Let's start with the salsa, their where 2 types, a pico de gallo and a hotter blend, which reminded me more of a smoky chipotle sauce.  Well the pico looked great, but had absolutely no flavor, no pepper ,no onion, no tomato flavor, not even the cilantro, which is my favorite ingredient to cook with, had flavor, even if you added salt and pepper to it, it didn't help.  The hotter of the two did have a nice smoky chipotle taste to it, so that was the one I went with it.   I went with the filet of Salmon with mango salsa with Spanish rice and black beans.  The fish was perfectly cooked, and even though the top of the fish appeared to have some sort of rub on it, it too was lacking in flavor, I tossed on the mango salsa to see if that would help and sadly it did not, no flavor at all. I topped it with the smoky chipotle to give some sort of flavor and appearance that I'm not eating mush. The rice and beans were perfectly cooked, no issues there.  Had this dish had flavor to it, it would have been amazing, but nope it did not.  Now like I said we were spilt into 2 along one sided booth table things from one end of the room to the other, and there was apx 25 if not more of us. But by the time my end of the table had gotten their food, the other half was already paying and leaving.  It was not because I was late; I got their in time for orders to be taken. This was poor planning on the server's behalf, half the party had ready left by the time we got our bills.  I was bummed because I was wanting to catch up with a friend I hadn't seen in a while and poof she was gone .  I wanted to like this place, but I'm afraid I am a onetime diner here."}
{"text":"Service tonight which was my husbands birthday , was awful , slow had to ask multiple times times for salsa , drinks , napkins . Food was not good polo fundito made me sick after eating it . Will not go there again ."}
{"text":"If you are not starving, just get the lunch portion. And even if you are starving the regular portion is so huge you can't finish everything and everything was delicious. My waiter was very attentive and very friendly and I enjoyed my experience very much."}
{"text":"I have been going here for many years now. The food is always good and you always leave full. The tostada is so big I can barley get my mouth over it to take a bite. The shredded beef tacos are great. I also love the flautas and the chicken fajita chimi. The chimi's here are huge! The beans and rice are great to. So many mexican food restaurants have rice that's tasteless, which is funny cause it comes with every plate they serve. You would think they would put some flavor in that rice, but here they do. Always a good meal and I would recommend it for sure."}
{"text":"The service was okay. The food is awful. I don't want a chicken taco that is full of lettuce. Let alone all of them are just stuffed with lettuce and hardly any meat. Not to mention food was not very hot when it got to the table. I will not eat there again."}
{"text":"First. How many damn doors is there to enter into this place? I saw people standing at one side, I saw a couple more on the other side. But I was closer to another so went in there, praying the door was unlocked the whole time walking up. I stood there for a few minutes waiting to be seated. Well waiting, I noticed that it was different levels, not just one main floor. Bar was in the middle seperated. Seating was up and down for people who didn't want to sit on the bar. Good to know since my mom would have difficulty with any stairs.  Next to the bathroom there are those free nieghborhood weekly papers, so I grabbed some of those.  When the girl finally appeared and seated me chips and two salsa's showed up fairly quickly. The chunky salsa was too salty for me. And the smaller salsa was pretty good. By mixing both actually improved it.  I ordered the pollo fundido. My favorite part? The sides of cheese that were \"burnt\". Not sure if they threw the plate in the oven for awhile after palting it, but the crunchy part of the cheese was delicous, with the jalapeno cream cheese -yum! It was filled with chicken and not bad. You had the choice of black beans or refried with spanish rice. I got the refried since I already knew I was only going to eat a bite or two. The spanish rice had been sitting all day. You can tell because it was clumpy - yuck!  The waitor was attentive and courteous. The meal was about $13.00 bucks."}
{"text":"We don't come here often but when we do it's great! We love the service and the food. The place is really nice inside and it's actually quite a big place, there is never a very long wait and fortunately for us we've been seated fast every time we've gone. We will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Best chili con queso in AZ.  Not a fan of the tostadas though they are HUGE."}
{"text":"I ate here the other day for lunch after playing a round the golf, so I was starving.  I ordered the cheese enchilada and shreded beef taco combo w/rice and beans.  A great value for 8.50, plus a margarita for 2.50 which was great as well.  The shreded beef taco was very good, though I didn't get any gucamole or sour cream with it, I suppose I should have asked for it.  The cheese enchilada was good, but I do agree with the other posters that they pile up the cheese on their food, atleast the enchilada.  The plates are sloppy to look at and when eating the food, the plate turns into a mess.  For the value, you can't go wrong, but I do think they can make some simple changes to better the food look wise and not mase their food with so much cheese.   I did have the mini chimi's years back and I remember how doughy and the lack of taste they had, not sure if they improved those at all."}
{"text":"Well. This was quite the experience! Party of 11 and service was horrible....but don't worry we got our food but it was cold! This made our table very upset...and even more hangry than we already were.  So we got over that....but my wife was served dairy...and he's lactose intolerant so that didn't end well...for anyone involved.  My aunt wanted to make sure the manager knew the taco was cold so he decided to stick his fingers in her taco meat. That was awkward to see!  There are better options folks....I hope this yelp finds you before you get to the restaurant!! GOOD LUCK!"}
{"text":"Completely unsatisfied with the service and food. The chili queso is thick and clumpy. As for the food, it had no taste! Will not recommend this place or go back."}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food can be found in my old home town of Las Cruces, NM, so I am particular about it. While Carlos has their own style of food, there are a few dependable items which are wonderful. Their margaritas are excellent, the spicy bean dip is authentic, and the appetizer folded, shredded quesadillas are very, very good. The chips are pretty much bottomless and the dip is good. The spinach con queso dip, while good, is really an american thing and not so much mexican. The service is excellent. The mini tacos are also very good. But I long for Las Cruces food..."}
{"text":"Tge food and service was perfect.  Our favorite now for a sit down Mexican dinner experience."}
{"text":"I went there recently and in the past it used to be my go to place. Sadly the food is not what it used to be and I no longer crave their chimichangas anymore. As for the Drinks yes these Margaritas are one of the best might just go for happy hour for now on."}
{"text":"Not good. Confusingly not good. We had a large group so there were a wide variety of different foods sampled. Lets just say, it is hard to screw up Mexican food. They found a way.  Here's what we had: #13 A lil' bit of everything. I got this based upon the handful of Yelp reviews that spoke well. It has a lot of options. All of them were 2-3 stars. Very grimy or greasy. The jalepeno cheese muffins were good. Had a strange fluffy cheese scooped on stuff. Just very confusing.   Fajitas. These were some straaaaange fajitas. The beef was a curled up over cooked version of meat. Certainly not a nice medium rare grilled fajitas. The vegetable medley was very confusing too. It had zucchini and other \"stirfry-type\" veggies. What?  Chips and salsa. Chips were good. Salsa was a strange stewed tomatoes and stewed bell peppers?!? All seemed like out of an old unmarked can in the corner of a pantry.  The other \"spicy\" salsa tasted powdery and not fresh.   Even the Beer-Rita and on-tap beers tasted odd.   Overall, confusing and strange."}
{"text":"Went for Cinco de mayo. .. wait wasn't too long.  Hostess walked around quietly calling names, it was loud and you couldn't hear her, they need a new waiting system or a louder hostess  we missed our name completely.   Once seated waitress came over took drink order and disappeared.    20 mins later I asked a guy walking around.  He promptly got our drinks.    Waitress showed back up took our order.  30 mins later no food.     Flagged down another waiter he checked and brought our food.   Apparently the waitress quit or was fired mid shift and the manager did not jump in to help her tables.   Yes, things happen but the manager should have stepped up to be sure her tables were covered.   Food was good, service was a disappointment.     We were there over 2 hours for a simple 3 person dinner."}
{"text":"This place knows service!!  Amazing staff...great food...great drinks...thanks COB for being a staple in the Arizona community!!"}
{"text":"Great for a guilty pleasure. I often stop in just to get a bunch of salsa to go. Staff is super friendly and quality has actually gotten better over the last few years"}
{"text":"I would like to invite everyone to my house at this time and join me as I recreate the whitest, most pedestrian Mexican food I have ever had in the valley. I hate being so harsh, but this place sucked. This place sucked more than having to turn down girl scouts selling cookies because I'd already purchased them. This place sucked more than a Burger King Hot dog. Let's begin with where it all starts. The door. The decor did not match. It's a RuPaul drag race situation, a bit confused and the carpet not matching the drapes kinda situation. The Chips, well I don't know how but they were dry,....does that make sense. I think I prefer a greasier chip. These were like crispy oven baked in texture, though they were fried?! The Salsa, two kinds. Watery and pasty. The watery one was the standard, this was bland and tasted semi metallic, like it was canned tomato, cheap canned tomato...not Tutti Rossa. The second was also standard, a pasty, thick very bland with a spice no heavier than Taco Bells Hot sauce. Gringo town, here we go. Yes, ok then. I know that Chips and Salsa are free, well, generally. I could not eat them if i did not like them...very true! BUT, salsa kinda sets the stage because I'll be using it for the rest of the night and I don't want it to suck. Here's the Gwylo run down. Tacos, Cheese Crisp, Pollo Fundido, Bean Burrito fried and enchilada style, Chili Relleno. Honestly, they were all terrible. The Beans are really bad, not that the food was cooked wrong or was not fresh, because it was...I just did not like their recipes. The beans were an off putting, loose (Weird) brown. The Crisp was very, very oily and not very crispy. Yada, yada. One of the worst though, and I shit you not, was the Enchilada sauce. The Red Enchilada sauce. I think..um, this is the M & P brand from food city. It's chalky and dry, very salty with an earthy, dirt kinda taste followed up with a tinge of steel. It taste like it, Im pretty sure it's M & P...I know this because I used the M & P brand on a Pork Shoulder in a pinch for unexpected guests and I used it. It sucked when I made it too.   I't would and would not surprise me if this place makes it. It's in a high rent area and they need to contimually pack people in to keep it operating. The good news is Mexican food is very popular, most people have bland buds and it's sophisticated looking enough that may make certain crowds crown the place acceptable. The bad news, food just sucks and AZ has some of the best Mexican food in the country. My server was very good, the place was very clean. FLLLUUURRRRP! Bummer. I kid you not, and I know this is soup-uh cliche...but Taco Bell food has more flavor. FLAVOR...not quality. Don't get it confused Yelp Nazis."}
{"text":"Been going there, since I was a kid! Still a great place to gather, large parties of 8 or more never seem to be a problem. The Irish Mexican pops out a mean cheese crisp! And they even have wheat tortilla's! Foods fresh, place is clean, service is great, & the tacos ROCK, but for a kick, my fav. is the green chili burros done enchie style!! Race on over."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and delicious/huge enchiladas! Spicy salsa is my favorite of all time. Good happy hour specials as well--the wings are spicy but good. Cheese crisp is delicious."}
{"text":"I used to love this place however it seems the quality of food just keeps going down and down. We didn't receive service until about 15 minutes later and that's after we had to ask for it. Our waitress was very sweet but it seemed like she was waiting most of the tables while a group of male waiters were just sitting around and chatting. I'm sad to say that I probably won't ever be coming back."}
{"text":"An unexpected find. A very homey and comfortable place. Food was fabulous! Had a steak chimichanga.....of which I've never tried before and it was amazing. The crispy outside and packed with goodness inside was just wonderful. The downfall is the portion size is enough to feed two people....so you will need to take the rest home..or share. :)"}
{"text":"It's hard to have bad Mexican food in the Valley; let's face it, there are many who have the food formula down. The separators amongst them all are the service and the cleanliness of the establishment. Carlos Obriens does a great job with those two things, and I've never NOT had a great experience at this one or any throughout the valley."}
{"text":"I first went to Carlos O'Briens for a staff luncheon and actually found the food to be better than expected. Since then, it's become sort of a default choice whenever we're in no mood to take a risk on a new Mexican restaurant.  The layout of this place has always fascinated me, as I'm convinced that it wasn't a restaurant in its prior life. Perhaps a dance club of some kind, but all of the levels and separate rooms of this place just seem kind of strange, yet charmingly unique, even if the whole décor does seem very dated by today's standards. I asked a server once if he knew what was in the building before Carlos (if any), but he didn't seem to know.  Because of the various seating options, including large tables that accommodate big groups, this place seems to be a very popular spot for large family gatherings.  As for the food itself, I'm actually a big fan of their chimi con queso, recently finding that substituting the chicken out with shredded beef makes it even better. They also offer up some decent enchiladas. Chips and salsa are pretty standard, while their fried ice cream desert isn't the best we've had in compared to places like PoPo's.    Portions are very generous, food is pretty decent, and service has always been fast. They seem to run a much better operation over here in comparison to the location over on Scottsdale 101, but that's another story for another day. Overall, I don't really feel there's anything that Carlos does that's better or worse than its competitors.  Recommended as a mostly reliable Mexican restaurant on those nights when you can't come to a decision on anything else."}
{"text":"Several months ago, I wrote a review of the original Carlos O'Brien's location on Northern and gave them a solid three stars. While I don't really consider Carlos to be any better or worse than most run-of-the-mill Mexican restaurants in Phoenix, I do feel that their product is at least consistent.  Honestly, I don't know what it is, but there's just something about this location that I don't like. Maybe it's the stark contrast in design to Northern. This location, situated just off Scottsdale/101, is modern, sleek, and bathed in some kind of weird red-light. I'm sure it's a wise aesthetics choice, as the setup fits in well with this area. And it's not necessarily that the location on Northern is better, it's just different - with all of its bizarre levels, separate rooms, and historic feel. It has been there since the 80s and I'm still trying to figure what used to be there - if anything.  Okay. The food, for the most part, should be exactly the same, right?  I'm not so sure. My default choice at Carlos is their Chimi con Queso, which is a chimichanga covered in a decent queso sauce. I usually substitute chicken out for shredded beef. It's never been anything I'd call amazing, but it's at least respectable. However, when I first tried it here, something seemed off. I couldn't put my finger on it. The cheese didn't look (or taste) the same, which I later confirmed by comparing my old Yelp photos. During a recent visit, my girlfriend ordered it and complained that the queso made the crispy tortilla very soggy and mushy, which I don't recall ever happening to me in the past. What's going on here?  Recently, I tried their \"Little Bit of Everything,\" which is a platter that includes a boatload of stuff, including a couple of mini-chimis with beef, flautas, a bean tostada, taco, a green tamale, and ultra-bland rice. Buried amongst the pile of mush, I also discovered some well-hidden beans. Hell, half the stuff I couldn't even identify. Additionally, my incredibly Mexican girlfriend couldn't even identify one item, picking it up and asking: \"What the hell is this thing?\"  When done right, I'm a big fan of platters, but to me, this just comes off as a total hodge-podge of junk that all blends in together (and not in a good way). I got bored with it pretty quickly.  Carlos does have a great dessert in their Galleta Grande, which is similar to the soft-baked Pizookies you'd find at places like Oreganos and BJ's Brewery. Although we skipped it on our most recent visit, I would at least hope it's identical to what you'd find at their other location. Someone should try it and report back.  On a positive, I love their Spanish version posters of popular American classic films. And unlike most places, these are authentic posters, not reprints. The owner clearly knows what's up!  If you like eating heavy Mexican food in massive quantities, with little regard to presentation or depth, I'm sure you can appreciate this place. And I'll admit, If I'm hungry enough, I'll eat it - but I would never consider Carlos to be a top choice.  Sorry!"}
{"text":"Great service, family friendly... best chips in Phoenix. Salsa is good as well.  You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Great margaritas!   There are a million places to eat in Phoenix but this is a personal favorite ."}
{"text":"Disappointed in the hostess that seated us.  She put us at a table that was right in the middle of a bunch of tables that had big families.  I don't have a problem with being around families but when there is just two of us and a lot of open tables I would prefer to sit away from the little kids.  When I asked the hostess for a different table she got an attitude.  She asked \"where do you want to sit!\" She lead us to a new table, dropped the menus and walked away like I really pissed her off.  We ordered drinks, mine was a margarita with no salt, it came and had salt.  My friend ordered a taco salad and it had a ton of sour cream on it. I had the soup and it was delicious.  I'm sure we'll go back again someday just not in the near future."}
{"text":"nah, son.   we stopped here on the way to our hotel after our flight from NJ. My colleague said to just pick anything out i saw along the way. I somehow expected ANY Mexican place in Arizona to be good, kinda like in San Diego. Apparently I was wrong.   I love carnitas. Our waiter raved about the carnitas there when I expressed my interest. dude was either full of caca or has never had good carnitas in his life. I've never had carnitas so dry before. this place is obviously about serving large portions for low prices - but the quality is lower than the prices. i wasn't even feeling the fried ice cream here. it's not easy to get me to talk negatively about dessert, yo.  the Cadillac margarita was okay. and if it weren't for the Frida Kahlo art on the walls I would chalk this experience up as a total loss. Frida gets a star all her own.  Oh, saw the end of the Giants/49ers game where the Giants won it in the last few minutes. that was good too."}
{"text":"I love Carlos O' Brien's!  This is the original location that I've come to since I was a child.  Hadn't been back for several years but it was as good as I remembered.  I was nervous about this trip as our party of seven included a celiacs gluten free and a pescaterian vegan.  Lo and behold we discovered plenty of menu options that met all of the needs of our party.  We arrived around 5 to beat the predicted dinner rush and were immediately seated. Loved the chips and salsas (chunky mild, hot-perfect complimentary flavors and textures).  I am fortunate to be free of special dietary needs this Christmas season as I make one last march up the hill before digging in for my next low carb restrictions for the next 10 1/2 months so I ordered the Number 9 (Burro, Taco, Tostada-burro..green chili...enchilada style (green) )  It was phenomenal.  All on the party were beyond satisfied.  I'm so happy my sister just nice in nearby so that we will be able to visit more often!"}
{"text":"Sorry, but the food here is terrible and overpriced. I have given it several tries and ordered multiple things, and it's always bad. I love Mexican food and especially queso, and this place was rated as one of the best queso places in the valley, and it just goes to show you those reviews must be bought and paid for, because it was Superbad not even fully melted cheese, cold with stale chips. Come on. I will not trust four square reviews ever again. People will still go here because of the location and parking and they are from wherever and don't know good Mexican food, but if you really want good Mexican food, Ajo Als on 16th street is the most consistent in quality and price. Apparently they did not pay the review sites enough, but they are way way better than O'Brien's."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and the food was delicious.  I would recommend this to anyone who wanted some authentic mexican food."}
{"text":"Awful. Absolutely no flavor. This is easily the worst Mexican restaurant I have ever visited. The service was terrible as well.  Save yourself some trouble and just go to Valley Luna or Arriba's."}
{"text":"I ate dinner here last night. It wasn't as good as my last visit.   I ordered a shrimp enchilada house special with a beef taco ala carte and a grande margarita.  The server was ok no complaints there, but the food just didn't taste all that great.   The shrimp enchilada was advertised as coming with a jalapeno cream sauce. It wasn't much of a sauce, more like a big glob of sour cream with some jalapeno mixed in. The result was that it made the enchilada taste cold. The rice and refried beans were at best average. The beef taco was alright, but I've had much better. The last time I went here a few months ago, on a slow night, it seemed better. But this visit on a Friday night, the food wasn't that appetizing.  I don't think I will go back to Carlos O'Brien's."}
{"text":"Hello Yelp,  So i gave this establishment a go opening week and needless to say it was a flop. The service was far from par.... Granted it was grand opening week and I understand things get missed and messy so I get it but the lack of training and basic knowledge a restaurant staff should have about their menu was scary . I sat down in the bar area around 8pm the restaurant was overall busy, the bar area maybe had 2-3 tables with people sitting down so that being said i waited almost 15 mins before being offered a menu, few mins later i asked for the beers on tap or if any drinks were on special for taco tuesday server said she had to check on that few mins went by returned with no answer about my question i walked over to the bar area where i read the taps of beer on draft. I ordered a tower station IPA which was amazing. For food i went safe with Carne Asda Tacos, my gf had ordered chicken nachos for a app, needless to say 20 mins went by after my beer was finished and i asked for another beer and also if she could check on the food she came back with the food and of course nachos were cold and tacos also.. she came back shortly after  we ordered and i got my check shortly did not finish my food.   So..... second take  we live in North Phoenix so we decided to give them another try this time it was a take out experience. 9/1/17   we called in a order for a Mexican Pizza with ground beef on top. and a Chicken Chimi meal. Server said the order will be ready in 30 mins sweet! we go to pick up the food and the take out host could not find it do to not remembering the name so they left under the phone number.......roughly 8 mins go on and a server comes out to ask me a question about my order and i told her what we ordered and the host then recalls oh ya we didnt kno how to spell my name so she put it under a phone number but didnt tell anyone or write it down for the host to be able to find it.... haha go figure right. over all  food seemed to be accounted for but, the mexican pizza was 16.95 due to not having the item on the menu ok fair enough the pizza was cold the cheese was stiff very stiff the pizza was also not even cut with a pizza cutter completely in tact, the chimi was however ok just shredded chicken wrapped in a tortilla,  so overall this place is literally 0/2 for us and we wont be checking back in only for drink not  get me wrong the craft beer they have is amazing and its not their fault the staff really doesnt know whats going on or how to properly take out food upon the category of the food.. I wish i could say better things because i have friends who love their other locations and rave about it. Honestly  people just go to VALLE  LUNA..... this location has  alot of work to do starting with the right staff to train these people on how a restaurant needs to be run you cant  serve cold food to customers its not right....

{"text":"Been eating here for years the food has always been good They have the best salsa My dad had his retirement party there years ago and the service was top notch the best The bar area is comfortable"}
{"text":"Used to go here a lot with the fam when I was younger, not sure why we stopped. Anyway, went this week for lunch. It was just as good as I remembered. Nachos are super cheesy, great amount of shredded beef too. They are a meal all by themselves. They still have my favorite dish- pollo fundido. Chicken chimis, covered in jalapeno cream cheese, and topped with melted cheese. That's one thing about this place, they are not shy with the cheese, which to me, is OK. Waiter staff was great, very attentive with drink refills. I will have to go here more often."}
{"text":"I can remember when this location was being built as a kid, little did I know that one day this place would make the best pollo fundido on the planet.  That's right, second to none and it took me many years to discover this wonderful treat of a meal.  I have been here many times over the years since I literally grew up with the smell since I lived right across the street from here.  The chips and salsa are so good here as well, the spicy hot sauce is the best!  All the meals here are large portioned and always delish, the atmosphere is very nice for the area and the bar is a cool place to hang out as well.  I love the different elevations throughout the restaurant.  The service is always 5 star as well, I highly recommend a visit here if you are looking for AZ Mexican food."}
{"text":"Been going since they opened on 16st & bethyhome rd. allways been one of my fav Mexican food spots n town  the hot sauce is great  & taco rice & beans top notch  all around great food good service."}
{"text":"We used to go here years ago. Been going to ajo als and Arriba's since. They are just closer to where we live. I ordered the pollo fundido, which is what I order at the other places. It was drier and not as tasty as I've gotten used to. Still a good dish but it'll probably be years before I go back again. The service was awesome. The guy who brings the chips and salsa and refills the drinks- totally awesome. My drink was never below 1/2- I love that. We tipped him separate..."}
{"text":"Nice place, but the food was disappointing.  I ordered the salmon last night, one of their house specialties.  Instead of a nice, thick piece of salmon that was pink/red in the center, it was a flat, thin, piece that was dry.  Rice & beans were so-so, rice was a little dry, beans were nothing special, sauce was a little thin."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch a couple weeks ago. I used to go to the location in Scottsdale before it shut down, but haven't been in a while. The food was good and pretty much what I remember. They have some decent lunch options. The chips and salsa are better than some other places. For lunch, ordered the beef chimichanga and instead of the usual red sauce, it was covered in green sauce which was tasty and different. It was a large portion with the beans and rice and I ended up taking half of it home. Overall, I remember it being better, but will probably return again."}
{"text":"I got the red chile burrito ( enchilada style ) with rice and beans . Was pretty good , I would order it again , but will probably try something else off the menu next time . Frank , our server was attentive and was overall a ok spot to visit . I read some posts saying the food was bland , I disagree . The red chile was flavorful . Not a bad place to pop in for some decent food and a cold beer . The chips were good , salsa wasn't anything special , kind of like the kind you get out of a jar ."}
{"text":"Me and my mom always come here and we always get the sour cream cheese enchiladas. I get mine with chicken and it's sooo bomb. The chips are fresh, thin, crispy and warm. The salsa is great but I wish it was spicier. Rice and beans are good too. Atmosphere is nice. Servers are nice. I would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys Mexican food."}
{"text":"I love the food here.  Our main location is the new one in Scottsdale.  Why 3 stars?  Guys... it's time to upgrade this building.  It still looks 30 years old.  Please please put some money into it."}
{"text":"So glad they finally reopened up this location.  We were here on opening night and have been back probably 4-5 times.  So good!  We are big fans of the food here and I have decided it's time to break away from my normal two rolled taco meals and try new things.  I have!  Service is always great and their chips and salsa is delish!"}
{"text":"This is the first time I have been to this location, it's a tad smaller then the other location but nicely decorated and the staff was friendly. It was my husband's birthday and they gave him a complimentary fried ice cream and sang it was nice. The food was good and the service was good also. If I was in the area I would come back:"}
{"text":"One off the best American Mexican restaurants. TeePee is another in Phoenix. If you want authentic Mexican grub, this is not your place but, they infuse some good spices you don't get in authentic Mexican food. If your taste buds are sensitive like mine, you will enjoy this American Mexican food difference. Many people that rate this food with few stars are expecting an authentic bland flavor which you won't get at Carlos O'Brien's. I really enjoy there salsa, enchilada sauce (infused with a little garlic), queso and many other items that accommodate my American Mexican food craving. I go to all three locations when in Phoenix and they all make the same type food."}
{"text":"Carlos O'Brien's at 12th St & Northern in Phoenix is a great place to meet friends and eat delicious food!"}
{"text":"Tacos are stuffed to the max and they don't hold back on huge helpings of rice and beans. Jeannie loved her fish tacos.Service is great!  They have Maestro Dobel tequila...try it! Fyi...happy hour 3-7"}
{"text":"Carlos O'Brien's serves up large portions and offers your standard Mexican fare such as chimichangas, burros, tacos, and enchiladas.  They offer a few vegetarian options such as chile relleno and spinach enchiladas.  Chips and 2 types of salsa are served at the table prior to ordering.  The chips are very thin, and the mild salsa is very tomato based, while the hot salsa tastes a bit more authentic with a good robust chile flavor.  Feeling like I needed more greens in my diet, I opted for the spinach enchiladas for my dinner.  The enchiladas themselves tasted OK flavor-wise, but while I appreciate that they used fresh spinach, it wasn't cleaned very well and I would get mouthfuls of some grit occasionally when I chewed.  I tried some of the 3 way chimichanga, which tasted decent, but it was hard to find the green chili part of the chimichanga.    Drinks were refilled promptly as needed, and service was generally good."}
{"text":"I wanted SO badly to like Carlos O'Brien's after many years away from it. (And, remembering being wonderful.)  Well, it just gets 3 stars now because it wasn't awesome as I recall.  The chips were pretty bland, flavorless. The salsa was only so-so. I got the chicken fundido and it was SO overly covered in cheese sauce and sour cream that I could hardly find my burrito.    The server never refilled iced tea until we were getting ready to leave. He seemed spread too thin.  Disappointed overall. I don't live in AZ anymore & spent one of my dinners there, eating a Carlos O'Brien's. Very sad. The company I was with was amazing which is the only saving grace!"}
{"text":"I love Carlos O'Brien's! It's not your traditional Mexican restaurant. I always get the Green Chile can Carne Chimichanga with their Jalapeno cream cheese. Service is always great."}
{"text":"Wow!  I took my mother who is visiting from out of town for lunch and we had an awesome meal (chicken taco salad).  My daughter had the mini tacos and she loved them along with the rice and beans. The service and food was excellent!  The resturant space is very cool and trendy.  I plan to go back this weekend to have a few drinks at the bar, looked like a fun place to hang out at night.  I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Food was good, service was terrible.  I'd love to see this place get a bit of a face lift, the whole inside as looked the same since they opened the doors, and it is really starting to show.  For my money I think this location has the best food, but the worst service.  I couldn't believe how terrible the service was when we came in yesterday.    Come on management live up your longstanding awesome reputation."}
{"text":"Mmmm, Do i ever miss their food.  the best Mexican restaurant in the area.  From their dinner chips with the delicious hot sauce to their amazing burritos. We were sure to eat there a few time a month."}
{"text":"If youlike American Mexican cuisine, you'll be a fan. Ordered the chili con queso- it wasn't aesthetically pleasing, but it was yummy... very creamy and served in a skillet. We also ordered the chicken fajitas to share. There was plenty of food to feed two people, and inexpensive- about $14. Lastly, I ordered the skinny margarita and wouldn't do it again. Tasted inorganic with fillers. It doesn't help we just came from El Chorro where they have the best margaritas though- so I was comparing. Worth trying out!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful lunch on the patio, great chips and salsa, Margaritas served by my personal servers Christian and Ian"}
{"text":"Disappointing. 50% of the experience is the interaction with the server, and this guy was terrible. We ordered a Happy Hour Cheese Crisp to start and then I ordered a Green Corn Tamale \"a la carte\".  My husband ordered a monster beef burrito called the Grande Burrito. Our lil cheese crisp came out quite some time after ordering, and then so did our dinners (within 3 minutes of each other). The other server in the bar delivered our food and offered more salsa and chips (our server was not attentive, didn't notice/didn't bother). I told my husband that the green Corn Tamale was not my favorite...didn't taste much like a Tamale. Come to find out that's because the server put in my order as a Tamale \"enchilada\" style...not what I ordered. We only figured this out after I pointed out two discrepancies on our bill. Irritated. The server argued with me and said the Tamale was only $5.95 on their \"lunch\" menu - we were given our menus by the hostess and it was not a lunch menu. He didn't know what he was talking about. I told him the cheese crisp was supposed to be $3.95 not $5.95 (dinky, worth $3.95) so he fixed that after 5 minutes but didn't fix the Tamale stating that was the lunch price only. I don't get rattled easily, but this guy gave bad service and now he is arguing. The manager comes by to tell me that I ordered it Enchilada style so that's why it was $7.95 instead of the menu a la carte price of $5.95. Weird because I DIDN'T FREAKING ORDER IT ENCHILADA STYLE!!! No wonder I didn't like it - I thought they just made a crummy Tamale but now I understand why it had sauce on top. The manager set $2 on our table and apologized for any misunderstanding. Too late - your server (and Tamale) left an impression that would not bring us back to your location.  Good News: Bartender with grey hair and ponytail actually knew what he was doing. Personable; too bad we didn't get him. Beer was good and husband liked the Grande Burrito that he should get 2 more meals out of."}
{"text":"The fastest meal I've ever had.  Brought dessert out when we weren't half way through the meal and the check before we ate dessert.  I think they see how fast they can get you out of the place."}
{"text":"I came in after a very long day so I was very hungry. This place came recommended but I honestly really didn't enjoy it. I had the fish tacos. The fish itself lacked flavor and was way too fried, black beans were over salted and had too much cheese and the rice was just not very good. I'm really bummed I didn't like this place but I just didn't"}
{"text":"portions are huge. dont fill up chips and salsa. i love it here. best cheap mexican ever. im writing in caps because this place is so good. staff are a bit dumb but whatever n"}
{"text":"The worst. My God. #9 combination platter. Green chili burro was the bland as hell but not as bland as the disgusting shredded beef taco. One bite of the taco and done. Didmtt even touch the been tostada. Never again I repeat NEVER AGAIN!! America's taco shop -1000x better. Almost forgot to mention the service was s l o w."}
{"text":"Average, run of the mill Mexican food. Nothing to write home about. I had the sampler. The carnitas were the best part. Everything else was just, \"ok\".  The part that drove the nail in the coffin for me was when a server dropped a bowl of salsa on the floor behind me, spraying my back, back of my head, the front of my girlfriend (she was wearing a white top), and two other booths and a table with red salsa. No apology, no sorry, no manager, not even cleaned up for almost 5 minutes, while other servers and patrons walked through the mess, with one lady almost sliped and had to catch herself.   The food isnt anything special, compared to so many other places that are competing for my money. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Timely seating, timely drinks order.  Then the wait...I think they forgot us. Had to go find server to come take order. Ordered.Waited and waited and waited. Not horrible as in the worst I've ever had, but you would think with the time it took from start to finish it would be super. Overcooked food is what we got. One of the kids wouldn't eat his burnt mass of \"nachos\", surprise. Best thing about it was leaving the place.  (P.S. the O'Briens part of the menu is lacking)"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! It's a great spot for Happy Hour. Can't beat the prices, Margaritas are $3.50 during happy hour and they are yummmmmy!   Plus they have a bunch of happy hour meals for $5. Their regular menu has decent prices as well. We typically sit up at the bar which is open seating and we are served immediately.   The staff is great, always so friendly and attentive.  We have never had a bad experience or bad food here.  Great place! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Oops!  I wrote this long review but in the wrong spot!!!  This is a great place, the restaurant is beautiful, the hostess so sweet, and our waiter the best ever!  This guy is so on top of his area everyone feels so important and never waited a minute for anything!  If you come ask for Christian!  He's amazing!!!  The Tull family are big fans of Carlos O'Briens!!"}
{"text":"Come here a lot to take my mom out and about for a bit. Service is always fantastic. We have yet to encounter a bad server. Everyone is always friendly and the food is great. I would definitely recommend the chicken taco salad! So good."}
{"text":"The last few times I've eaten there the service has been consistently bad.  I wait anywhere from 5-10 minutes to get seated, not because there aren't tables, but because greeters are either on the phone or, in the most extreme case, first seating a group of her many friends who came to see her on her birthday.  Then it takes another 10 minutes for a server to show up at my table, followed by another 10 minutes for simple water.  The food arrives dried out from sitting under the heat lamp too long.  I haven't given up on Carlos', but will stay away for a while in the hopes they work out their service issues."}
{"text":"First off lets get the Mexican food subject tackled. There are a few types: Senoran New Mexico Mexico City Tex Mex Fresh Mex(BLARF!)  I am an Arizona boy. I grew up eating americano senoran Mexican food. There is ABSOLUTELY nothing wrong with loving it. Is it real \"Mexican food\" who's to say. Do I appreciate other styles of Mexican food? Hell yes I do! Tex and Fresh being the lest of my favorites.  When I got to Mexico I don't go looking for a cheese crisp and a shredded beef taco. I go looking for hangover cure menudo. I go looking for brain exploding chicken mole. I celebrate Mexican food in all of its delicious forms!  So now that we have that out of the way.  Carlos O'Briens... This is a perfect example of americano senoran style Mexican food. I love this stuff.. I crave this stuff.. I have a Mexican food fuel gauge that must be filled when it hits empty.  You cannot go wrong with the classics here.  Cheese Crisp: One of the best in town.  Guacamole: This is what quac should be. Its not 50% tomatoes. Its pretty much avocado, lime, salt, garlic, cilantro, some chilies. It is amazing and I feel is only topped by what I make at home which is the same style.  Shredded Beef Taco: Again how it should be. The beef is stuffed into the taco THEN deep fried so you get those delicious crispy fried beefs ends in the taco. It is then piled with delicious Mexican cheese blend.. real cheese..  Red Enchilada Sauce: This stuff is great.. Your enchilada will come swiming in it again covered in cheese which is salamandered. When that cheese grease mates with the enchilada sauce.. Mmmmmm happy place.  Rolled Tacos: Both the beef and chicken are good.. Again filled then deep fried and covered in a huge glob of quac and cheese.   Favorite Meal: #1 Combo (comes on two plates because its thats big!) Shredded Beef Taco, Cheese Enchilada, Rice, Beans Cheese Crisp with guacamole. Ask for it WITH guacamole. You will get WAY more on it then if you order a side and its actually cheaper. If its to much scoop it onto a plate and enjoy it on some chips.   Bottom Line...  You will leave without a gaping hole in your wallet. You will leave with a very full stomach. The service will be acceptable. You will be happy. They also have great lunch specials here. They raised them a bit but its still a good deal.  Also.. do yourself a favor and stick to the northern location. The owner pretty much lives there and the quality is just better. When he isn't there they have a very trusted manager who has also been there forever and takes great care of the place."}
{"text":"Decent Mexican food.   I thought the drinks were over priced for the size and quality.   When we walked in, we were told the wait was going to be 25 minutes and encouraged to order a drink st the bar.  Didn't think anything of it given there were several other groups waiting.   However, as soon as our drinks were ready from the bartender (maximum of 5 minutes), our table was ready.  I watched the same thing happen to several other people that walked in.  Not sure if this is a process they follow to boost sales or just poor data regarding table availability."}
{"text":"If you want a the most delicious thing in the world-try the BEEF tamales with rice and beans...its so fantastic....perfect...when you sit in the bar you get instant service......what a nice valentines day meal~"}
{"text":"We had a meal there on sunday-sat in the bar-we had DJ for a waiter-he was attentive and awesome-we had the most delicious food..I had the tamale with red sauce and rice & beans...its highly addictive ..the chips and salsa are fantastic.....wonderful experience....the food they serve has sooo much extra flavor it will blow your mind...."}
{"text":"I wanted to take my sister out for dinner last night to celebrate her upcoming 21st birthday prior to going to see Cirque Du Soliel. We both love Mexican food and Carlos O'Brien's is literally within walking distance from my house. We used to go all the time as kids, but it has been years since I have been there last.   I'm glad we gave it a try because we had a really great experience. We were seated immediately even though it was 5:45pm. We had friendly, attentive service from both our busser and our server.  We were served delicious, warm tortilla chips shortly after sitting with a tasty, fresh, and chunky salsa. They also provided the liquefied hot sauce, but I did not eat it because I do not like that kind at any restaurant.  I decided on the veggie fajitas. The black beans are vegetarian, the refrieds are not. My sister selected the fajita quesedilla, sans meat.  Our food arrived quickly and piping hot. Both of us had huge portion sizes and the food was extremely fresh and really tasty. They put a salty and slightly spicy seasoning on their fajitas, which come with a mixture of peppers, onions, squash, zucchini and potatoes.   Back in the day when I used to eat meat (15+ years ago) I always ordered the shredded beef chimi. It was amazing. I would assume that it retains the same amazing taste and size as when I favored it as a child, but who knows.  Our meal came to $21 and I gladly tipped our server over 20%! I will definitely be back when I have a cheat day on my diet!!"}
{"text":"I love the number 13. I never ever get the beans and shredded lettuce and onions that it comes with on mine. I always have mine special ordered.  you can also order online and over the phone. the staff is nice.  I've gone there for 7 years and originally I had a chimichunga until I saw my boyfriend's food  (number 13) and it looked so delicious that I would order it.   It's so filling that its a meal for 2 days."}
{"text":"Attentive server.  We ordered Fajitas (chicken and steak) and had plenty of food. The chips and salsa were excellent.  Clean restaurant, visually appealing, tastefully decorated. ... the TV'S should be upgraded to something bigger so you can see the score ;-) Highly Recommend"}
{"text":"Was not welcoming or good. I have a service dog and I understand the rules but after I put her on the floor in her bed the manager kept walking by giving me the creeps and made it very awkward for my husband and I. They do not like or welcome service animals and the food was cold and gross. Never again. I have no idea how this place stays in business especially with all the great new places in the neighborhood that love our dog and our money."}
{"text":"I've been going to Carlos O'Brien's since I was a child. It's one of the finest mexican food establishments in the valley!  I admit that I am in a perpetual rut with regards to their dishes; I never eat anything but chimichangas!  However, my mother always has the pollo fundido, which I've also tried; it's AMAZING!  I love their salsa as well.  I've been going for 20 years, I'm not stopping any time soon!"}
{"text":"Full plate of not so tasty and unrecognizeable food.  tacos were soaked in grease.  Phoenix just doesnt know how to do Mexican food....:-)"}
{"text":"I am an Arizona native I used to love this place. WHAT HAPPENED!!! This place is gross. I ordered the burrito enchilada style Gross! The chips were cold I hate that. The service was fine but the food was horrible. Never going back!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with 2 of my work colleagues. 1st time here. We were greeted and seated pretty quick and the food was quick to the table. I think the server was new. He forgot a few requests and had to be reminded. My colleague ordered a diet pepsi and he noticed the glass was dirty. It took a while for the replacement to make it to the table. We noticed about 3 little fumbles. Oh well, you gotta start somewhere i suppose.   I ordered the macho chicken burrito. Nice chunks of chicken and lots of it."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for over 20 years it's been a family tradition my mom started and now I bring my kids love the food never had a bad experience here ever"}
{"text":"This is a must if you've lived in Phoenix and have never gone...Go! The food is great. The service is quick and the fried ice cream is to die for. I would recommend saving room for desert. Great place for large parties or company meetings."}
{"text":"Great food and great service will definitely recommend and will return. Make the trip you won't regret it.  More stars if I could give it to them.***********************************************************"}
{"text":"I like the new location. It's bigger and cleaners than the old. We had Carlos O'Brien cater a lunch at work and it was very good. Took the family to try it out the new location. I got the Chimmy with shredded beef. The beef was a little dry but the plate over flowed with food. You get your money's worth.  I believe a good sign of service is when your glass never goes empty. This night, the service was very poor. I do not blame our serve as it looked like they were understaffed for a Friday night. We waited to get a refill of chips. They brought the chips without salsa. We waited for salsa. We waited for the food. We waited for the check. Again, I do not blame our server. She was working as fast as she can but there were times I noticed no one serving on the floor. At the end of the night, we spent $80 with a tip. I hope this was just a bad night. I had such great hopes for Carlos O'Brien."}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing service. Ordered chicken fajitas they were very good and the portion was really huge. My husband order #13 and thought it was unbelievable as well."}
{"text":"Cheese-aloo!! I came here with a coworker for lunch one Monday. I had the chicken enchiladas and albeit it was very tasty it was soooo cheesy! So were my coworkers tacos. We had a small plate just full of all the cheese we didn't want to eat haha. I love cheese, but wowza.   We also had to have a margarita since they were only $3.50! Yumm. Can't beat that.   There was no wait, which was nice and the place was clean. I had an enjoyable experience and wouldn't definitely dine there again :)"}
{"text":"I love this place! The service is usually on point, though drink refills can be a bit scarce. I love the chips and salsa. They have the fresh fried thin crispy chips that most places don't serve. The salsa is fresh and loaded with flavor. It lacks a bit in the spice department, however they give a small secondary bowl of hotter salsa that had a smoky chipotle kick. As I have said before I am a bit of a one dish wonder, however since my favorite dish here is actually an appetizer I have branched out and explored the menu a bit. First off if you hit up happy hour, get the guacamole. At $5 and change it's worth it. If it's not happy hour, I wouldn't bother it's not $8 guacamole. The first thing I order, after my margarita is the Shredded Beef Bontonas. I order them without olives because they come with giant whole olives and they are hot from the melting process. Not something I'm interested in eating, but it's up to you. I also always order with extra cheese. I'm an addict and just watching the cheese stretch between my chip and the plate warms the small glutinous cockles of my heart. The blending of the green bontana sauce and the tender shredded beef is over the top. It's full flavored, but not spicy. If anything I would like the spice level kicked up a notch. If I'm planing on ordering another item from the menu, I opt for a half order (unless you are eating alone, you are going to have to decide whether you are going to fend off the vultures with the pointy end of your fork, or let the scavengers descend) The small order is plenty to share, and as a meal is also quite generous. I am just one of those girls who takes eating seriously and I can put away some nachos. Other items on the menu I have tried are the beans (standard), the fajitas (standard and as with most places the price is disproportionate to the actual amount of meat provided) I am a sucker for enchiladas, and these are definitely an item I order quite frequently. I do have gluten issues, so burritos, chimichangas and floutas are not something I will ever order."}
{"text":"Great food, very responsible prices, awesome atmosphere and the kids like it too. The refried beans are kind of weird but everything else is great!"}
{"text":"Oh Carlos O'Brien you never let me down. The food and service were fantastic as usual. I ordered the combination plate. One ground beef taco, beef enchilada and refried beans. It was so good and quite filling. Literally I have enough, for me being a light eater for the next two days for lunch. Oh and this location is a lot nicer than the old one. Great move."}
{"text":"I love their beer battered fish tacos! I also love their salsa for the nachos- service is great as well! I love how consistent they are in their fish tacos - everytime I go there , their tacos is consistent superb!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The portions are HUGE! And food is yummy!"}
{"text":"My friends ate here fairly late and we were all starving. Our waiter was friendly and never neglected to refill our drinks or ask us if there was anything else we needed. I had a  chimichanga.....of which I've had tried before and it was amazing. The crispy outside and packed with goodness inside was just wonderful. The downfall is the portion size is enough to feed two people....so you will need to take the rest home or share. :)My friends  said that the beef tacos and beef burrito were amazing as well. We had eaten here before, but not in a long time. Now, however, we'll be sure to keep this place on our restaurant radar .."}
{"text":"Every time I'm too lazy to cook or my significant other We come here, it's delicious! Food is always on point 5+ never a bad experience  Our favs are pollo fundido, chimichangas & enchiladas  Its also a walking distance, from where my significant other lives so that is a plus!   The service is what we don't like, there's always a person with an attitude, or we always end up with the wrong order. All in all food is amazing..service just needs a little work."}
{"text":"This is usually our \"go to\" place when we have visitors from out of town.  Been going here since about 1990 (almost 30 years) and never had a bad meal.   But, tonight was different. Waitress was very short and snippy from the beginning. \"Sandy\", our waitress, didn't seem too happy, or maybe overwhelmed, even though it wasn't crowded.   Food came out and all was okay, except mine. Pollo Fundido is usually piping hot and delicious. But this time it was cold to the touch.   Sandy didn't come back until after we were finished to ask how things were and inquired why I didn't eat. I told her it was cold and she stated that I should have said something. When I told her she never came back, she said \"I've been here like 40 times!\"  Really.......not.    The drink and chip guy was good. He refilled the drinks and chips.  Sandy...nothing but a bad attitude.   After my complaining, She brought a free fried ice cream, but then brought the bill. $14.00 inedible Pollo fundido included. I asked for the manager and told them to keep the cold pollo fundido. Just take it off the bill. The manager took it off, without an apology.    I really hate complaining at restaurants and love giving a good tip for good food and service. I used to love this place.   Sandy never came back to pick up the bill.  We had to pay up front and again, the \"manager\", said he will work on the service.   Hopefully, just an off night. Hate to see this place go away. But, we won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten at Carlos O'Brien's in a couple decades. I remember LOVING Carlos O'Brien's!! I will say it is similar, but it was disappointing from what I remember. The WORST part was our barely there waitress!! She didn't even clear off plates when dropping off the check OR when she returned with our check after processing it!!! She left us there with dirty plates and napkins all over the table while we stayed for a bit visiting with someone we have not seen for a year (we wanted to visit for a bit...it wasn't busy as we arrived about 2:00 in the afternoon)!!  My shredded beef taco was just as I remembered:  Large, tasty and with lots of cheese!! My red enchilada literally had ONLY a tablespoon of red sauce!! Our waitress was Missing In Action, so I left the enchilada for last and asked for some sauce to-go when she dropped off the check. When I got some sauce, I poured some on and tasted the enchilada. The CHEESE was NOT what I remember. It was more like an imitation cheese, not a good quality cheese.   My hubby ordered a chicken burrito and it was HUGE. He reported it was basically \"tasteless\" and that it simply was nothing but shredded chicken. No seasoning, no chili's, no tomato, no onion, no sauce.   Overall, we liked the tacos, the tostada, the rice, the beans, the chips, the salsa and hot sauce. We did not like the burritos or enchiladas. We likely will go back on occasion to meet up with our friend who has moved to this area, but will not order the same items.  Three stars as the food was just average with BAD service!!"}
{"text":"So disappointed!  They closed one that did such a good job, and opened this piece of crap.  Let us start with the interior, you walk into a greet station complete with seating to wait.  WAIT, no this is not where you go to get sat, you open another set of doors and are now in the bar, wait WHAT?  Here you find the greeting station, and now we wait looking like deer in headlights wondering who is going to seat us.   Ahh finally someone seats us right at a waitress we absolutely do not like.  Should I say, hmmm sure why not, HEIDI, if you get her run away.  They must have been in a hurry to get the place open because everything about the decor screams last business in the building including the horrendous panel dividers separating the dining from the bar.  We are sat in one of the booths that is open at both ends.  The booths that are against the wall are raised to where if someone is sitting in them you are looking right at they're crotch. So we place our drink order and a cheese crisp, and I notice the bus boy/chips and salsa getter is too busy placing settings at empty tables then to bring chips and salsa to us, (by the way there is only 4 tables sat so they so needed the settings done).  We get the chips and salsa and are told the cheese crisp will be out soon, (menus sitting on edge of table so obviously we are ready to order), and Heidi walks away.  Here comes the cheese crisp, and there goes Heidi again. Ok now she comes back to see if we are ready to order omg. We order and she does her best at saving us money by saying shes going to give us items off of the lunch menu instead of regular menu we looked at.   Now for the food her sour cream enchilada/ chicken,  she picked most of the chicken out of it saying it tasted cooked, frozen and thawed, OR it was from a can.  Mine was shredded beef tacos, shredded beef had no flavor and tasted pretty dang awful.   Lets not forget about the rice,  where do I start.  It tasted old, was very sticky and in wet clump piles.  It is time to pay and get the $%#@ out, wheres Heidi, shes staring out the front window. The bill is here yay!!!!!!  NOOOOOOOO......  2 Dr. Peppers, 2 dinners, 1 cheese crisp $52 WHAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Took 5 minutes to get her attention even though she is helping the table right in front of us repeatedly.  Guess what she put that tables order on our bill too......  Maybe we wouldn't notice and pay it?????  8 minutes later we get a corrected bill, $30 for half eaten food.  While all this waiting is going on we are paying attention to the wait station.  It consists of I believe a 5 shelve wire rack.  At the top is to go boxes and cheese crisp boxes.  The next shelf down has odds and ends and 2 pitchers on plates, one is water and other is tea.  The next shelf down has the utensils in it, yep underneath the wire shelf with the pitchers on it.  The next shelf is where they are putting all the dirty dishes.  We can't see the bottom shelf.  And the best part is the garbage can is right next to the shelves with nothing preventing the food from flying up as it is thrown into it.  This was chance number 3 at the new location.  THERE WILL NOT BE A 4!!!!  WE ARE DONE WITH YOU CARLOS O'METHINKS NOT!!"}
{"text":"I've had the opportunity to dine at this location twice now.  Service has been quick, place is clean and it's a fairly comfortable Mexican restaurant.  So on the topic of Mexican... I get the Carlos, yet the Obriens.... not so much =).    The top 2 recommend dishes on both visits were the Pollo Fundido and the #13 A Little bit of Everything In Miniature!  Sadly, I have had both and they were both just borderline OK for me.  Not much flavor (though decent serving sizes).  I do not understand why it's so hard to find good, especially authentic tasting Mexican food in Arizona?  Sorry C.O. just not a winner for me.  Best to you and the customers that are fans.  I'd strongly suggest to spice things up."}
{"text":"first we got sat in the loser section and then the waitress dipped out after neglecting us, leaving her poor tip with the nice lady who replaced her. not gonna leave the poor tip with the nice lady but she should be shunned for three years. food was bomb tho. AND SHE FORGOT OUR FREAKIN GUAC!!!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to go to Carlos O'Brien's for many years... Horrible food!!  Went to the one in Avondale - just got back (7/11/14 - 1:38pm)   Ordered a water - tasted like sink water (unfiltered) - Dr. Pepper - was all soda water.  They said they corrected it and it was basically syrup - hey not that big of a deal. Chicken fajitas taco salad - bland, flavorless machaca tacos w/ rice and beans - premade, store bought taco shells, machaca had no flavor and there was 1 small piece of meat in each taco the rest was veggies salsa - no heat, no flavor, store bought would have been an improvement.  To make things worse - I was charged a fee for using my credit card - they didn't even tell me about the fee, nothing was noted on the bill either."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. I had the chile relleno and my boyfriend had the \"a little bit of everything\" plate. I can't wait to go back and try the other items on the menu..."}
{"text":"Not my favorite...this restaurant has a lot of hype...we found it to be very pedestrian, very average.  The service was impersonal, the food was mediocre and the ambiance was boring.  I'm sorry, but if this is all Carlos O'Brien's has to offer, I'll get carryout from Filliberto's."}
{"text":"I thought for the longest time that Carlos O'Brien's was an Irish pub, so when I friend called me to meet up there It was a complete surprise when he told me that it was actually a Mexican restaurant.  I thought the staff was very friendly and welcoming, but really the vibe of the place does not feel like a Mexican restaurant at all until you see the menu and taste the Frozen margaritas. The waitress kinda looked at me like an airhead when I asked her if they had blended margaritas but once she said Frozen she knew what language I was talking.  Their happy hour isn't bad. My chicken quesadilla was a disappointment as it did not come with any sour cream, salsa or guac. The salsa that actually came with the complimentary tortilla chips was rather a disappointment and completely lacked in flavor.  My advice if you want a great atmosphere and also a great patio with some great Mexican fare and great service, go north to Jalapeno Inferno!"}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot when I lived in Phoenix however I now live in San Diego I flew in this Friday and made a specific point to visit the restaurant that I used to love when I lived there.  What a disappointment yes we were a table of 9 but it took over 45 minutes to get our food the restaurant was not that busy since it was 8 p.m. example the server brought the fajitas without the tortillas and said she'd be right back that never happened I would have like to order another drink but it actually have to find someone to help you.  After waiting that whole time for the food the food was cold.  We had asked for more chips since it was 45 minutes without food she said she'd be right back no more chips. I always start from 20% tip and either go up or down obviously I went way down"}
{"text":"Food was good but the service wasn't really great. It wasn't busy when we were there so we sat and talked for a bit after dinner. The waiter never asked if we needed anything else after our food was served. No drinks, desserts or boxes were offered."}
{"text":"Overall, PASS!!  1. Easy to find and plenty of parking space.   2. Service is good, nothing bad and nothing over and beyond. They are nice and responsive.   3. The food SUCKS and I mean SUCKS!! Everyone stated how distasteful and pricy it was. We all ate because we had been traveling and were hungry but left feeling like McDonald's would've been a better choice."}
{"text":"Wen here for cinco de mayo dinner....very yummy, had the pollo fundido, and the whole plate was more than enough for one person!... Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour good food and good service. What more can you ask for it's not overly crowded and the place is huge so usually you don't have to wait for long. They also have a good selection for kids menu. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Carlos O'Brien's is perhaps the largest restaurant in the world (overkill? Maybe, but it's still a pretty big place) and there is this strange swing hanging from the rafters in one part of the restaurant.  I really wonder what it used to be.  But, now it's Carlos O'Brien's.  If you are dining in, order the queso dip.  It is delicious! But that's really all I would recommend.  Everything else is mediocre and super cheesy.  However, if you are using them to cater, I say order the mini chimis, mini tacos and mini flautas.  Great price to feed a large party at your house.  Also, with the size, there is never a wait."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate at Carlos O'Brien's last night; to our dismay, the food was inedible.  It was a disappointing evening since we do not go out to dinner very often since the recession.  I ordered the Carlos Carnitas Dinner.  The pork tasted dried, rubbery, and days old.  Between us, we ate three bites of it and put it aside.  My husband's dinner, Pollo Fundido, was not any better.  The pollo fundido was over salted and made with poor quality ingredients; the chicken appeared to have come from a can versus fresh, and the cheese tasted processed versus real.  We only ate a couple of bites of it and sadly called it a night, going home to eat bowls of cereal for dinner instead."}
{"text":"Ok, so I grew up with Carlos O'Brien (the one in N Scottsdale), So I am certainly biased about the food here. I like it, it's nothing special, it's nothing amazing, it definitely isn't authentic, but it reminds me of my childhood. This was my first visit to this location and it was as good or better than the other location. I had a cheese crisp, and it came out waaay underdone...I sent it back (which I rarely do), but they threw it back in the oven and it came out crispy and tasty. The service was good and this location is HUGE. Anyway, I would go back for 'Arizona' Mexican food."}
{"text":"Carlos O'Brien's is the defining Mexican food of my childhood. Their Bell rd location (that essentially is this location's predecessor) was near my house as a kid and we ate there often. The new location is larger, brighter, and looks a bit cleaner. The food is essentially the same. I feel it falls into the category of good 'bad' Mexican food. This is not your street tacos place.... I mean, come on, the restaurant fuses Mexican food with Irish pub food.... it's not authentic. They do have some decent menu items though. The cheese crisp is delicious..... you would think you can't mess up a cheese crisp, but that is actually quite false.... this place does it right.  Their burrito fundido is mediocre. Their chicken fajitas are fine but overpriced. In fact, most of their food is overpriced. Regardless, I'd still return to C O'B's if I were in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Well, they were open and not doing anything special for NYE. That should have been a clue. But...I haven't been there in years and I have a friend who's been doing a lot of work for them, and I wanted to see how the food stacked up these days. Sadly, the report is not a good one.  First, it was nearly empty-another bad sign.  Then, the waiter seemed to be a friendly guy, but not good at waiting tables.  I never got enough water, my date didn't get an offer of another drink...  The food.  Oh boy.   I have never in my life tasted frijoles that tasted like they were made with dried french onion soup mix before. The salsa verde had the same bizarre flavor. We ordered two different dishes, and they were both indistinguishable-and not good.  The decor is strictly 1979 dark wood, and the railing for the steps had a handwritten sign on it that said something like, \"this is not a seat.\"  It wasn't expensive, but Juliobertos has MUCH better food, so who cares? I'm tempted to give it one star, but we didn't get sick."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure about going here. It came highly recommended but I read some reviews and they weren't great. I think the problem is that some people have unreasonable expectations, especially after having visited for myself. The food was pretty good, the portions were unusually large and the service was far above average. This is not the best Mexican food I have ever had, but nobody at my table had anything but positive to say about their menu choices. My daughter in particular had an adult-size meal that she ordered from the kids menu. I tried it. It was almost as good as my carnitas chimichanga. I hope that people wait til they are in a better mood before they write their reviews. When a place truly sucks then I could see, but this place doesn't."}
{"text":"At the Scottsdale location, they used to have a really wonderful manager, an older Mexican gentleman who put his heart into the place.  They got rid of him, put in a relative and things declined.  I'm surprised Corey let this happen.  It used to be a special place.  Then prices went up and quality declined."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch today the place was actually pretty empty so I was surprised at how long it took the food was good not amazing but good would go back. For some reason I just think the one on Northern was always better when I was growing up"}
{"text":"The food was really oily and blend in taste. The only good thing about our dinner was the guacamole. Mediocre tasting over priced Mexican restaurant sums it all up.   I don't wanna be like other Yelpers and try to be a food/restaurant critic without credentials but I think after living in the valley for 12+ years and after eating at hundreds of Mexican restaurants through out the western US I can give advise to the owners of this joint you are not in Minnesota or Wisconsin you are in Arizona and people here knows the difference between good, bad and really bad Mexican food and your restaurant is trending towards the latter. Cheers"}
{"text":"We had Excellent food & service (Tonya) yesterday for a birthday lunch. Very friendly staff, nice decor, comfortable dining experience. Food was hot, and of course there was plenty of it. Chips, salsa & beverages were never empty!  So glad there is a location closer to us now. We've been Customers of the original location since the 80's!  Only One bad thing : NO hostess at door to greet us, so after a Few Minutes of waiting I grabbed menus & we sat ourselves. We were close to just leaving and dining elsewhere.  Also there was No hostess as we exited to say thanks, hope to see you again soon ... AND there were 4 customers just standing there looking very annoyed waiting for a Hostess to show up so they could be seated as we were walking out!!! So, Why hire a hostess?"}
{"text":"My husband & I took my mom out for her B-day dinner. We sat at a table in the bar area. Our server was Hannah. She was the best server I have ever had in my life. The food was awesome like always. Absolutely love Carlos O'Brien's"}
{"text":"From what we understand, Carlos Obriens is authentic Arizona fusion Mexican.  We guess this means that the food has tons of cheese, no spice, and little flavor.  The first thing we noticed was the ambiance; the decor looks like a upscale steakhouse or a nice Jazz club that would serve cocktails at their modern bar.  This makes the dining experience odd, because they serve cheap food on ugly, plastic plates.  We assume that the building was another restaurant prior to Carlos Obriens; otherwise, we think that the management couldn't decide on what they wanted the concept of the place to be.  My wife ordered the Pollo Fundido and disliked it.  All you could taste was the mound of cream cheese sitting on top of the dish.  Besides the cheese, the dish had very little taste and absolutely no spice.  We asked the waiter for some of the green enchilada sauce that we'd seen in the menu's description of their Threeway Chimichanga (This was the other option she'd thought about ordering before going with the Pollo Fundido)  to help add a little flavor.  I guess we confused him, because he brought her a small bowel of the green chile stuffing instead.  I had the Carlos Carnitas Dinner, which I enjoyed.  It was a decent meal, but I felt it was overpriced at $13.  I've had similar portions and quality at other places in the $8 range.  Overall, my wife gave this place a two and I gave it a three rating.  This gives it an average of 2.5 stars.  We rounded down, because they made the cardinal sin of charging extra for tortillas.  If you are a Mexican restaurant that gives only one tortilla with a meal and charges extra for more, your gonna loose a star."}
{"text":"New to Arizona this was the worst Mexican food ever the table side guacamole was a greenish brownish!  I ordered a shrimp and enchiladas it was caked on with cheese the black beans were old and dry the rice seemed old my husband got fish and chips it was frozen fish refried so gross the best thing was the Cadillac margarita . Please don't go to this place our bill came up to $50 the worst $50 I ever spent!"}
{"text":"I tried this with a social coupon. The skinny margaritas are not that good. The food was o.k. but not worth the effort when I have better closer to my house."}
{"text":"Now take note: this is real Mexican food. Great job on relo. These guys are part of Phx Mexican food history and their roots go very deep. N Phx very luck to have them!"}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food restaurant west of the Mississippi.... don't believe me then don't go. Save more room for us locals. Chips and Salsa are on fire! Chimichanga Con Queso is heaven."}
{"text":"I'm not from the area and was completely overwhelmed by all of the choices of restaurants in this complex. It is a magnificent thing! A co worker brought me to Carlos O'Briens, and I was not disappointed.   It was about 7pm on a Wednesday night. The server seemed overwhelmed, but he quickly caught up and turned things around.   I ordered Grilled Shrimp with Macho Salsa $16 (Shrimp lightly marinated served with rice, black beans, and macho salsa). It was very good and was served piping hot, within 10 minutes. Wow.   The kitchen, and eventually the waiter, were on point. Note, this timeliness is what took the rating from 3 to 4 stars.   My choice was not the best value, but that is often the case with seafood (in the desert). However, this looked like the exception, most other items were moderately priced.  Also drinks were excellent - tasty grande margaritas ($8) and mojitos ($6).  I highly recommend"}
{"text":"Now, I wandered in here unexpectedly to kill time... headed for the bar (of course) and ordered a draft beer. Bartender suggested the SanTan lime leaf after I mentioned wanting a lighter type beer. Great beer, cold and just right. I can see this place getting crazy busy other nights, but right now (Tues 8:30pm) it's pretty chill. There's a nice crowd, spread out. Tv's are on and not loud; always annoying when TVs and music are blasting in a place where you just wanna relax. I got complimentary chips and salsa, pretty darn good. Since my roots stem south of the border, I tend to judge things like chips and salsa, rice and beans, tortillas, etc... lol. Why? Cuz I can! I kid... Moving on, their salsas are stupendous! Wait, did I just say stupendous? I did because they're both really good! Bartender is muy bueno and I have decided that I like this place. Plan to come back and try some of their food."}
{"text":"here for happy hour on the patio 1st strike was the lipstick on my draft beer glass. 2nd was the the very rude server who treated our group like we came to dine and dash... the good points the chicken fundio and them accommodating my friends lap dog on their patio. good food bad service. yo Pancho stop being an ass no tip for you buddy."}
{"text":"I had the steak fajitas. They were very bland. There was more of the veggies than meat  and the guacamole tasted soured. It took almost a hour to even get our food and they don't bring it on a skillet but in a paper tray than put on a medal plate. I believe they microwave it before they bring it out"}
{"text":"My family and I dined here recently, and we were disappointed to say the least. I ordered the Carne Asada medium rare, and it came out extremely well done. Plus, it tasted awful. The rest of my family was equally unhappy with their dishes. The only dish that was passable was the Carnitas platter.   Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else; there are plenty of great Mexican joints in the Valley."}
{"text":"This was good for higher end mexican food, I am more of a fan of \"truck/street food\" but A great place for lunch!! big portions, good prices. The other reviews are dead on with the chips and salsa...very yummy!"}
{"text":"We order for lunch all the time as my boss loves it, I am greatfull for the free food.But yuck. I have had the machaca tacos and they were dry and hard. The pollo fundido chimi was tasteless  and plain. Not spicy, not salted, and dry chicken. The red salsa is okay. I wouldn't pick it but I'll eat it if it's around kind of deal."}
{"text":"It had been years since I had been to Carlos O'Briens and last night was a reminder why it had been so long. The wait was short..we were seated right away and before we even settled into the booth we had our water with our chips and salsa. The waitress was pleasant and refilled our beverages, the restrooms clean.   So why do you say, \"Only 2 stars?\" The food..where to begin about the food. Our meal started on such a high note, the chips were hot and the salsa fresh..that is where the high notes end. My pollo fundido was extremely dry with chicken that tasted like it had been boiled with absolutely no seasoning..no salt, no pepper..nothing. The jalapeno cream sauce was good and the dish had plenty of melted cheese, but all of that unseasoned chicken just made it so very unappealing. The beans  had a good flavor but they looked like they had been under a heat lamp for a while, all of that gooey melted cheese couldn't hide the hard, dry crust that had formed on top. And the rice....I will just leave it at that, rice  The husband had a shredded beef enchilada & taco combo. He ate the enchilada, said it was ok, but the taco..again, boiled, unseasoned meat, which he left on the plate. The child had a grilled cheese sandwich. Really over toasted bread with unmelted cheese, how can you mess up a 4 year olds grilled cheese?   Carlos O'Brien has the potential to be a great mexican restaurant. It's affordable, the restaurant is clean and they are in an area with not a whole lot of dining options (maybe that is why they have been a round for so long) but unless they take a little more pride in the actual food..I don't think in this econony they might not make it."}
{"text":"One of my go to restaurants for many years until they opened another closer to my house  I pretty much get the #9 combination with a green burro and substitute the tostada with another taco to give me 2 tacos.  I love their open face cheese crisp and the Pollo Fundido which are 2 chicken chimichangas with sour cream and cheese on top.  Their complementary chips and salsa are great but don't eat too much before your meal arrives so you.  This is my go to mexican restaurant when my family can't decide where to go even though my kids don't care for mexican food a great deal.  I could probably eat here everyday if I could."}

{"text":"It's alright, nothing spectacular. The best part of the meal was the friendly waiter telling funny stories. The food was only slightly better than Chipotle or Cafe Rio though. I recommend not getting the refried beans (which are liquidy and gross) and substitute pinto or black beans instead. That should improve the meal. My fajitas were good, but not very meaty. My friends Carne Asada was so salty she ended up leaving a third of it on her plate. My wife's tamale in green sauce was alright, nothing special. The chips were pretty salty too... I guess if you have to come here it is not going to be a terrible meal, but I recommend researching some better Mexican places in the area like Habaneros Grill."}
{"text":"Awesome everything! Best refried beans in town,  and the green sauce is next to none! They always hey the order right."}
{"text":"I ripped Carlos a new taquito hole three winters ago, but today's experience was much improved, and I've never been so pleased to add an update.   The hostess led us towards an \"upstairs\"  booth, but quickly recognized that my elderly mom doesnt walk that well, and offered \"lower level\" seating instead.  We didnt take it, but I cant tell you what a good impression it makes when the first person who greets you \"gets it\". Someone who anticipates needs rather than waits for you to explain them.   Our server was good too. Pleasant, but not overly familiar or chatty, and absolutely efficient. No mistakes.     My favorite (and least expected) discovery was what I think they call a \"Healthy Menu\" or something.  Shrimp Macho (ok, stop laughing)  had six good sized shrimp,  shells removed, quite nicely seasoned and pretty well cooked.  It was $7.95 with standard mexican combo sides. I thought it was a very good value, and if the sides were better, an outstanding one.   Lunch for two, which includes a big basket of chips, was $20 before tip.  Why only three stars, when my apoplectic rant (see below) bestowed two? Well, the chips and salsa are pretty bad. The drinks come in those awful little plastic \"glasses\" that hide dirt and god knows what. The back of the booths provide zero back support. It's just not a five, or even four, star place.   But today's third star represents a wholesale change in at least one customer's opinion of Carlos.  It will probably never be my favorite spot, but I previously railed that no one here \"gave a shit.\"  That's obviously changed and is worthy of mention."}
{"text":"Our party of four was there for happy hour Dinner Thursday April 5th,2018.  We were seated at our favorite booth in upper level back area which is more private.  I had a glass of Pinot Grigio; and my wife had a glass of Chardonay (unoaked). others had just ice water.   We started with chips, dips and Guacamole Dip with excellent hot sauce.   My wife and I had Fish Tacos which were excellent.  One guest had Veggie Burrito; and ,one ad small cheese sandwich.   Our waiter SERGIO was outstanding.  He was quick to our every need.  ie extra water, extra ice, extra hot sauce, etc.   It was a very pleasant experience.  We can not wait to return!  sincerely,  Edward and Dina Altman"}
