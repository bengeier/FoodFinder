{"text":"Best subs!  I wish I discovered this place long before a few months ago! I always order a few subs and take some home for later! Good prices too! You'll hate going to subway for a sub after you try these subs!!"}
{"text":"Had the buffalo chicken salad and steak sub for the first time it was fantastic I will be back for sure. The subs are big the salads are huge the service is fast the interior is clean and the staff is very attentive"}
{"text":"I've had the steak and the Italian.   Both were good.  It is a little slow even in non busy times, but has not deterred me from repeat visits. I don't know/care about any other location in Slippery Rock.  I am reviewing this location, not any other."}
{"text":"I like both the variety of sizes to choose from and the good, toasted bread.  Using playing-cards as the 'take-a-number' gadget is novel in my experience.  Quick, polite service.  I enjoyed my first trip, so I will be back."}
{"text":"I have NEVER had a problem here! Everyone who works there is awesome and the food is to die for. I know what your thinking... it's just subs.  And that's true, however,  their subs are some of the best I've ever had.  Fresh ingredients everytime! The flavors are great too. I will be a customer for life!"}
{"text":"Subs aren't very good to begin with, and I find myself going to other restaurants in the area because the menu is simple, not much too it. Wish that property housed a different business!"}
{"text":"The battleship at the triangle bar and grille is the best hoagie in pittsburgh. But bobs subs is a close second. I love that they use cellones bread for all their subs. Ive had the spicy italian, chicken salad and buffalo chicken and they are all great. I usually get the senior which is a 13 inch hoagie and take half to work the next day, and its just as good the second day. With reasonable prices i highly recommend trying it out."}
{"text":"Working in Pittsburgh for a couple of weeks...  Decided to try Bob's in Allison Park.  My crew and I were impressed.   We had the Spicy Italian.   All was fresh and the roll was Great!  Personally I like the heavy mayo.  Sandwich wasn't spicy though.  We will be back to try the steak sandwich,  employees at PPG say that one is the best one..."}
{"text":"Expected it to be like the original Bob's in Slippery Rock and it was just a terrible imposter. Menu isn't even close to being the same, nor is the quality of the food. Subs were average. Subway-quality. Disappointing."}
{"text":"This is not a franchise of the Bob's sub & sandwich shop in Slippery Rock.  So those going here in the hopes of getting an original Bobs sub will be sadly disappointed.  They make a great attempt to look as if they are but are not."}
{"text":"No idea why people rated this place high. Cheap quality meat, greasy sub's with next to no flavor. Hugely disappointing"}
{"text":"Worst sub ever! Low quality meat. Ate there when it first opened and will never go back. Tried to contact manager online, but unable to. Do not waste your money on low quality food.  6/7/17  Linda"}
{"text":"Understaffed Prepare to wait  Food is good, Call in advance to order. There are two kids working the day I was there, they are polite and working, but totally short handed for lunch  Try slippery rock location"}
{"text":"Great sub shop, typical in town business gets cramped and backed up around lunch time. Pictures on the walls give a great nostalgia feeling."}
{"text":"Apparently you have to dine in or you've wasted your money or maybe my sub would have been terrible either way. Definitely too much of the condiments. By the time In my car and opened my gigantic sub that I was so excited about, it had soaked the entire way thru and the meat just fall off the floppy, soggy, sipping wet bun. I had to literally wipe off my arms after each bite. I gave up. Later I toasted the bread in the oven to try to rejuvenate half of the sub but had to toss all the toppings. I just felt I had to eat some of it...since I had spent $13 on a hoagie chips and drink. Waste of money. And the steak was pretty gross and grissely too."}
{"text":"Fantastic subs, welcoming atmosphere, and they entice you with donuts while you order. Prices are great."}
{"text":"Super yummy, surprising little sub shop. Stopped in looking for a quick lunch as we passed through. Good food, great value, friendly kids working. Had the turkey and the cheese steak. Both really good. Will definitely stop in again if we're in the area."}
{"text":"Really good subs and salads.  I enjoy the atmosphere, fun and great music. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"I love Bobs Subs! Tasty n made to order...yum! I've gone a couple times n have never been disappointed. Best  ever."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a sub definitely go to Bob's sub. I've been getting the junior(medium 9''). It fills me up for the most part. Nice atmosphere and a college town favorite."}
{"text":"Best Italian Hoagies around. Quick and priced well. I will be buying my hoagies from Bob's!"}
{"text":"Pretty good subs! Not too much in way of sides and everything is a little pricey but overall pretty darn tasty! I like coming here every now and again when I can spend a little extra money not normally in the budget. I know most people go crazy over Bob's. Their little donuts are pretty cool and tasty too. My fave is the totally turkey!"}
{"text":"First time I have gone there for a sub and it did not disappoint. coming from central PA have hard time finding a good \"hoagie\".  I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Despite making my sandwich wrong last month, I tried again today. Yet again wrong. I asked for a simple cheese steak with onions. This one has lettuce shredded all over it. Last time was mayo. Regret not checking before I left again."}
{"text":"After a half dozen visits I can confidently say these are the best subs in Pittsburgh! My whole family looks forward to a Bob's Sub for dinner."}
{"text":"It gets pretty crowded in there around lunch but the sub's and prices are really good and well worth the wait. They are pretty good size sub versus anything you would get at Jimmy Johns or any other generic sub shop."}
{"text":"After struggling through another bout Jimmy John's depression, I broke out the ol' dart board and let my future ride on the back of a knurled barrel steel tipped dart as it sailed towards a map of downtown Pittsburgh. It landed on Bob's Sub.   I read a few of the reviews and it seems like most of the complaints were about a confusion with a different Bob's Subs, but not so much about the food (outside of the mayo issue). I'm sure there are more than 1 Bob out there who likes to make sandos, so I gave it a shot.  Victory. The subs are tasty, made quickly, cheap, and the staff is friendly. A great new lunch solution outside of JJs. I would highly recommend ordering your sub with only half the regular amount of mayo, because good God are they heavy handed with it."}
{"text":"Sandwich was very good, I had a philly cheese steak without onions. Bread was tasty and the chips were excellent. The service was good and the staff was friendly and enthusiastic. Prices were decent. The atmosphere was a little fake... All the pictures on the wall appear to be printouts from the internet so they get a deduction. Good, not five star great."}
{"text":"Long time Bob's Sub Clarion patron here, and this location is doing it right. The food is just as good as the Clarion location. The decor is cheesy and they aren't as fast, but not bad with a bunch of kids working there."}
{"text":"Wow.  This is a gem, First off I want to give props for the layout and design of this place.  They could have done anything better.  The colors, music, Uniform, everything is perfectly laid out for a great atmosphere and great time.     I got the chef salad & roast beef sub.  Sub is very good, it's a normal sub. I got the JR and it's a good size.  I don't think the price is too much it's like $6, but the quality is better then subway.  Bread is toasted to perfection & the mayo/dressing isn't overpowering the meat..  the veggies have a good crunch and taste fresh as well.   Salad is decent. Ranch dressing is pretty solid.  They slice the sweet onions very thin so their actually sweet..  good amount of meat & cheese on the salad.  They definitely didn't skimp.  I wish there was more lettuce but it's a pretty good portion.  Maybe just another handful would be all I change... but there is so much meat and cheese that I am ok with lesser lettuce lol. And I like the container it's in too ;)  Overall, I like everything, I like supporting small business.  And I love the layout of this place.. so I will return and suggest to anyone, go try it!!"}
{"text":"\"Bob's Mayo Sub\" Ok, whoever is making the hoagies, EASIER ON THE MAYO!! I scraped off a couple teaspoons and it was still saturated with artery clogging mayo. I never saw so much mayo on a sandwich in my life!  Food should make you feel good, not dead."}
{"text":"The sub I had was really good (number 4 on the menu). The service was fast and nice. Next time I will tell them to go light on the mayo.... other than that I was really pleased!!"}
{"text":"My Bob's Sub was so good that I discovered I can unhinge my jaw and consume a Bob's Sub whole.  Don't think I'm kidding.  WTF how is it THIS GOOD and I didn't know about it?    It all started when my friend and I realized we'd had Indian food at the Curry Leaf buffet for 4 days in a row, and that Chicken Tikka Masala is 700 calories a serving.  Woof.  I'm not saying we were looking for diet food, but we decided to get not Indian food.  Bob's is not diet food, but it is Non-Indian, and right by Curry Leaf.  It's about a block up from the United Way Bldg on Smithfield St.  It was crowded, but the line moved really quickly.  I had the Chicken Salad sub, which had no description other than \"You Gotta Try it!\"  My friend had the Buffalo Chicken sub.    Holy fuck my sub was so good, and I'm not sorry I swore.  I took a bite and smacked my friend in the shoulder.  You might think I'm overreacting, but listen I was hungry, and that sub was GOOD.  All the subs are on toasted Cellone's rolls, with lettuce, provolone, onion, tomato, mayo, and Italian dressing and some sort of miracle happens.  If you're looking for a new lunch spot, I recommend this place.  Its way cheaper than Subway and so much better tasting!  Be warned:  they drench your sub in mayo and dressing, so I would ask them to go light on it.  I'll definetly be back!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and really enjoy it. It's quick and cheap. I think that the junior/medium sized sandwich is big enough for left overs. I've had the Bob's delight, the spicy Italian and the steak n cheese. So far the Italian was my favorite. You can get all sandwiches Bob's way - lettuce, tomato, mayo, onions (there might be more but I forgot). But you can also get any of these extras for free banana peppers, jalapeños, green peppers, pickles, mushrooms, black olives, ketchup and mustard. Lastly, they are going to start selling homemade donuts!"}
{"text":"One of the best sandwiches I've ever tried, everything on the menu was great including their salads. their bread is perfect.  if you don't like mayonnaise make sure you tell them that, as they typically go heavy on the mayo."}
{"text":"I love this place! I get lunch here with coworkers every Friday, and it always makes for a great end to the week."}
{"text":"Decent subs.  Nothing spectacular, but good value for the price.  Certainly beats subway."}
{"text":"This store itself I'm grading five stars; Bobs subs the franchise, would only get three or four though.  I love these white girls. The taller one with the shrieky voice and beady eyes can definitely get it, but I digress...  If you know the place then you probably know the food. However, this one sells mini-donuts and breakfast sandwiches now, and that's why I'm writing the review.  First of all, dont get the 'sausage', there's nothing spectacular about the sausage. That bacon however is high-quality meat! Get the bacon-egg-n cheese....Bobs way...with banana peppers. You're welcome"}
{"text":"Let's get something clear....if you're looking for the relic of your college memories where you would grab a sandwich half hungover from the night before.....this is NOT the same place.  Now that that elephant is addressed, they are a decent place to grab a sandwich.  They have a good selection, I personally go for the Spicy Italian which has a generous amount of meat and toppings on a Cellone's roll.  They have a number of sides to choose from such as chips, cookies, and pickle spears.  There is a bit of a crowd and wait at linch, but you can still grab a sandwich to go relatively quick."}
{"text":"Awesome subs, they have a nice kids option, PB&J toasted sub.  Our kids love it.  Everything we've had is tasty and well portioned.  I've been recommending this place to everybody I know when it comes up."}
{"text":"Ever since moving to Pittsburgh I've been told to check out Bob's Sub downtown but haven't gotten around to it. When I saw one went in near me in North Hills I had to go!  It is in the same space as Delicious Donuts (which I'll also have to try).  I stopped one evening to grab a sandwich to go and settled on a Senior size Spicy Italian and Potato Salad Combo Bob's way which includes mayo and in-house Italian dressing. The sub was huge for the $7.95 price tag and all the meats, cheeses and veggies tasted great and fresh!  I really liked the dressing which brought it all together. The Potato Salad was also very good and a decent portion size. Think your standard \"Grandma Style\" Potato Salad.  There ordering system is pretty neat and I've seen it done before at another sub shop in Akron whose name escapes me but I digress...they give you a playing card and when your order is ready, they call it out.  King of Clubs! Your order is ready!  The only real draw back I saw at all was no one was at the counter when I walked in and I had to shout a little to get someone's attention.  Granted it was later on a Sunday night and it was a very young staff.  And when my order was called I had to remind them of my Potato Salad because they forgot in the span of 3 minutes...like I said, young staff.  But it's ok Bob! Your Sub was worth it!  Try for yourself!"}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum!!!!!! If you want a fresh, old fashioned sub go here!  I am watching my fat intake so I ordered the turkey with just a little Italian dressing.  It was very good.  The fresh bun, shaved onions and fresh lettuce and tasty turkey made a great, low guilt sandwich.  My husband had Bob's delight with the recommended mayo AND dressing.  I took a bit.  It was fabulous!  The price was right and the service very good."}
{"text":"I went to Bob's Subs tonight and ordered a ham and cheese sandwich the large one. Waited like 10 minutes to get my sandwich and then we checked the sandwiches before we left because it smelled like somebody had burnt bread when we checked the sandwich it was unbelievable they put one thin slice of ham on each side of the sandwich and one piece of cheese on each side of the sandwich I took it back in and ask them if they were serious about this when they gave it to me it's like where is the stuff on top the sandwich I asked for cheese and meat only what I was looking for more than one slice of each I will never eat there again"}
{"text":"I only wish I could give it ZERO.  This is a fraud.  The guy is using the name and has no connection to the Slippery Rock shop.  The sub's taste Nothing like the original Bobs'.  Google it under 'news.'  The bread is floppy and the mayo is definitely a different brand altogether.  Not worth the price of the sandwich."}
{"text":"I stopped in at this joint while getting some tire work done at Highland Tire, and needless to say, it was a terrible decision to even leave the tire shop.  The girl at the counter was friendly, hence the 2 stars, the steak sub on the other hand was completely underwhelming.  Expensive and I left hungry...you can get 2 French dips with the imaginary coupons at Arbys for $6 and be bloated to the max and super happy, instead a few doors down, I spent more for half the food and a quarter of the satisfaction.  I heard so many things about Bob's in slippery rock but apparently, these aren't the same...if you want a cold cut, go to the grocery store and buy some deli meat...who in their right mind would pay for a sandwich you can buy an entire loaf of bread and a pound of meat for the same price as one sandwich...American laziness?  Hey Bob's, call up the 9th street deli in Indiana, PA...they can help you out on that steak sub."}
{"text":"These sandwiches are really good they offer a variety of different sandwiches a star office the freshmen the Junior and then I believe it's the senior and Junior is probably at least 12 in itself.  When you walk in the order they provide you a card such as for Spades the Queen the king Etc and then they call your card number and you go pick up your food.  This location is a small location so if you have a party bigger than 2 you might have a hard time finding a place to sit together.  Overall Give It 2 Thumbs Up."}
{"text":"Best subs I've had in a long time. Ordered the junior totally turkey and junior spicy Italians. Made perfectly, perfect amount of condiments, and not that messy. Good location, and plenty of outlets for phone charging. I'll be coming back here when I'm next in this area."}
{"text":"OK, this is a fun place to have a sub.  Both sides of the building have huge roll up garage doors that are all windows.  The food is very good too.  I got the freshman size which is big enough for a small lunch.  The junior size is twice as large and is good if you just finished playing ice hockey or riding a 20 mile bike ride."}
{"text":"Good food and very reasonable prices. Very fast service and fresh food. I had the stake hoagie Bob's way and it was delicious! Chocolate chip cookies are outstanding!!"}
{"text":"Excellent! The service was fantastic! Very cool quirks that make it stand out from other hoagie shops in the area, including the laid-back environment and the way they use a card out of a deck of cards to hold your place in line/call your order! Perfect bread:fillings ratio, and the Spicy Italian was spicy but not TOO spicy - it was amazing!! The North Hills needed something new like this!!!! I will definitely be going more often!"}
{"text":"I've been driving past this place for some time and after reading some reviews decided to stop by for lunch. I came in Saturday at 12:30 and ordered a Buffalo chicken sub (9 inch). It comes with lettuce, tomato, ranch dressing, mayo, and provolone cheese. I replaced the provolone with Swiss cheese and was handed the 9 of hearts (my number to call). Within 5 minutes my sub was ready. My order with a drink came to $8.61 which I thought was very reasonable. The chicken was actually shredded chicken and a bit messy with the dressing and buffalo sauce, but the sub was toasted to perfection and was mouthwatering. One of the best subs I've had in a really long time. Better and bigger than subway and jimmy johns.   The only downside is the inside seating area is very small. They only have 4 tables, 2 booths, and a high top section that seats 3 people. It was pretty crowded in here. There is no blinds or shade so the sun just beats in while you are eating. Also the bathroom was small and outdated. Could use some work to make that a little more clean and presentable.   All in all like I said one of the better subs I've had and fast service that can get you a nice meal filling you up for well under $10. I would recommend this sub shop."}
{"text":"Chicken salad sub was awesome, portions were good and staff was friendly will definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"I've been to Bob's a handful of times and have never been disappointed. In my opinion it's the best sub in all of the Downtown area. I usually get the Spicy Italian or the Steak 'n Cheese but today, after reading one of the reviews here on Yelp, I broke out of my comfort zone and had the Chicken Salad Sub... although it was a bit messy, the sub was delicious and I was glad that I tried something different. Great subs, good service for a cheap price has earned Bob a five star from me."}
{"text":"Just one short block from our favorite music site, Steamworks Creative.  Bob's just does simple subs without the mess, though I have learned to bring a few paper towels myself.  Place is kept very clean.  Service is quick.  Product is fresh.  A few tables, a bar that faces the street.  Old timey with an interesting history displayed on the walls.    I refer people to Bob's before the music starts.  Roy"}
{"text":"This place has grown on me. It's a far better option than subway and less expensive than some other chains"}
{"text":"I had high hopes when someone told me their steak n cheese sub is as good as Uncle Sam's in Oakland. Not even close! It was meaty but it was bland. The side that came with my meal is ridiculously small. I thought she was giving me a container of ketchup and was surprised that it was my side of macaroni. It's like any other generic sub places around."}
{"text":"I really liked it.  Great new sub joint right in the Point Park/Art Institute zone.  For me, perfect place to grab a bite before an evening class.  Prices are really cheap.  If you go at lunchtime you can get a combo with a \"freshman\" sub, side (chips, macaroni salad or pickle spears) and a soda for $5.50!!! OMG, that's super cheap to me.  And the freshman is really quite large and stuffed with meat.  I don't think I could have eaten any larger of a size.  I tried the steak and cheese (no cheese, no onions -- the onions are raw, not cooked, so: No. Thank. You. to them.)  The sub was great.  Hot, fresh, tasty -- and that was just the guy behind the counter! (rim shot!) No seriously it was very good and just what I was in the mood for.  Of course if I had been normal and gotten the cheese it would have been even better and stayed together.  But I don't like cheese all the time and it don't like me! (lactose intolerant)  The macaroni salad did waylay me with an unexpected bite of fresh, raw onion -- bleh!  Almost ruined my taste buds for my sub.  Personally I would steer clear of it in the future, even though it was very fresh and otherwise tasty.  Other than that, great cheap meal on a cold night.  The dining room is pleasant and a lot more clean and comfortable than a lot of sub joints I have seen around.  Looking forward to trying the egg salad, which is made daily.  Hopefully without onions!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic. The restaurant is clean and the decor is nice. Service was fast, friendly, energetic, and eager. I have been there a few times now and each time the food was excellent. Good parking and convenient location."}
{"text":"Got a turkey hoagie - take out loaded with everything.  The sub was good and very large.  Only knock was the bun exploded on me while trying to eat it...my own fault since I got it loaded.  Others in group got chicken and cheese steak...no complaints in the group."}
{"text":"These subs are absolutely amazing! I get one at least twice week. The chicken salad is my favorite. I just started going to point park University and someone told me about Bob's subs and how good they were!. Boy were they right!"}
{"text":"This place was alright. It wasnt amazing, but a decent sandwich joint downtown is always welcome. Smart idea marketing to college kids in the area, since it could be hard to differentiate itself with places like Di Bellas and other local shops not too far away (Primanti's, of course, the Pgh King...but Bob's isnt trying to be that).   I had a 'Junior' (Bob's-speak for MEDIUM) Bob's Delight, which is said to include Cappicola, Ham & Turkey...except they forgot the Cappicola, or perhaps there was one slice and I missed it. All subs are served \"...on a toasted Cellone's roll and include lettuce, tomato, onion, provolone cheese, mayonnaise, and our own Italian dressing...\", except all I could taste was the healthy slathering of mayo. Dont get me wrong, as a true Pittsburgher, I like a generous amount of mayo as much as the next yinzer. But even this was a bit much for me.   Overall, you get what you pay for: its cheap meant on a decent roll toasted sandwich. Inexpensive. Fine for what it is. Next time, I may try the Steak and Cheese, or Italian, just to be sure, but not going out of my way for this one.   Also, I'm not from Clarion/Slippery Rock, so I dont have any opinion of this vs the 'original' Bob's, but I am curious about it now. People are very passionate about it (and I would be pissed, too, if some place was piggybacking off my biz name)."}
