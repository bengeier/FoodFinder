{"text":"Best bar at kamms. The food is amazing and the staff is awesome. Outdoor patio is nice, and great booze selection."}
{"text":"Thursday day bartender is amazing. She's so polite and attentive!!! Foods great and my glass is always full!!! I think her name is Shane or something"}
{"text":"Its a Great place to hang out on the weekends.  Friendly staff,  great food, fun atmosphere, variety of events /specials and a warm patio for the winter time. Always nice to see familiar, friendly faces."}
{"text":"Went over to Back Stage tonight for some food.  We had some pasta, which proved to be worth the modest price.  The wife says that the meatballs were okay but a little lacking.  I had the Sicilian Chicken Tortellini.  It was fantastic.  I really like it that they have mix and match options for their pasta dishes.  Good beer selection and good music.  Really low key kinda place....Nice place to check out if the other bars in the area are really not your scene."}
{"text":"Although I grew up in the area, I had never heard of this place before. Had to meet someone for a business lunch, this was their choice. The parking was easy enough and the servers were very friendly and fun. As another reviewer mentioned, the music was a bit loud and distracting. However, it is a rock-n-roll themed business called \"backstage\", so I doubt anyone is too worried about turning down the volume or softening the tunes. I think it might be a fun place for Clevelanders who know more about rock music than I (almost everyone). The interior decor was a bit eclectic. If you prefer booth seating, I don't recall that being an option. They were having a problem with a flickering light. Other than that, it was mostly a dark, roomy, bar atmosphere. Mostly tall tables and some sectional couch seating. I wondered if it was the property from a dance bar I had visited YEARS ago as the wooden floor seemed expansive. Our food exceeded our expectations. I had asked for specific items on a sandwich.  From experience, I don't expect anyone to get it right. In these other instances of not getting it right, I don't complain, I just take note. In this case, the order was spot on. Both of our orders were satiating. Why is it so difficult to feel like you get what you pay for? In this case, we actually did. The server was attentive and checked back with us, refilling our water frequently and asking if we needed anything else. We enjoyed some light banter about current events with her and another staffer."}
{"text":"Always have awesome service! Great smoking patio!"}
{"text":"We went here for the first time on a Friday night with a friend from Pittsburgh. We were very pleased. It was a great atmosphere for a group of 7 spanning their 30s and 40s. We all ordered food and drinks. The food was awesome! We have all been raving about Back Stage since we left and look forward to returning for dinner sometime soon. The drinks were well made and served quickly. The prices couldn't be beat either, especially for the quality of food. Face it, everyone expects less out of \"bar food\" I would have been happy getting this at any restaurant. In fact it was the best burger I've had in years. We had 3 of us on our bill, 3 meals, at least 8 tall mixed drinks(often $6 each at other bars), 4 beers, and another 9 shots betwen us and our bill was under $100. My husband and I've gone to dinner withOUT drinks and spent 50 bucks for significantly inferior food. We will recommend this place to everyone! I finally made a yelp account just to review this place, that's how good it was!"}
{"text":"I used to only frequent Back Stage for drinks late on weekend nights, but had always heard I should try their food.  One Sunday afternoon when drinking was not in the cards for us my friends and I decided we should give it a try.  I was so impressed that I did not believe I was eating at the same place I have seen many a people run to the restroom, fall asleep etc.    I ordered mozzarella sticks as an appetizer and I couldn't believe the abundance of flavor there was in the breading.  They were large as well and it was plenty to split between two.  For dinner I ordered a flatbread, and my two other friends ordered a build your own sandwich and the buffalo chicken wrap.  I tried a bite of both of theirs and wish I would of had their meal.  While my flat bread was good it did not compare to their meals.  I did not feel like any part of the meal was frozen, it was all well seasoned and when you go during the day it really cleans up nice.    I would definitely go back as there was a burger on the menu that was calling my name!  Next time your in Kamm's Korner don't let the dark bar steer you away!"}
{"text":"This place had GREAT food for really reasonable prices! I got a shrimp quesadilla for $9 and my friend got a tuna steak for $10! Service was great even though it was super busy because there was a bar crawl. There's also a nice patio and bar in the back that was enclosed for the winter (though it was pretty smokey) but I'm excited to check it out when the weather is nice!"}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, great staff = the trifecta! BOGO lunches all week long, and Tablupa for most sporting events (half off your entire tab if they win the game). Huge patio and a great place to watch the Brownies. Try the flat bread pizzas or the $12 filet... Yummy!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere feeling. Not overly crowded. Nice flow in the layout so people aren't pushing you out of the way. Great drinks. Friendly Clientele and Staff. Enjoy my time here better the West Park Station. Def start here next time I am on this strip when returning for business in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Have gone there on four separate occasions, two dinners and two lunches. The food has been fantastic on all four occasions the flatbread pizza is great, as our the burgers. Also really enjoyed the chicken and steak dinners. Service was good and prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Worst Sunday afternoon Football experience!  Had to go find waitress multiple times!  Get your act together!"}
{"text":"I've only been here once, early evening on a weekend. The food was good. The fare is pasta, burgers, pizza, wraps and typical appetizers. I'm not sure how loud this place gets when there is a band. I remember this place when it was a dive bar called 'the arcade'. It's quite a step up from those days."}
{"text":"Been here half a dozen times. I like the rock decor...guitars hanging in walls, bands and dj's on weekends, Touchtunes jukebox, not too brightly lit. Outside bar in back is always popping. The food is good. The mussels are outstanding. Calamari and tots good. I tried the turkey reuben recently. I didn't care for how dry the inside of the sandwich was and how greasy the outside (bread) was. Service has always been good. Fair prices.  Now the bad. Parking can be impossible if you come late on the weekend. You pretty much have to park in the back parking lot which is small and is for several other establishments. Also, they have left the front and back doors open on more than one occasion and it was COLD and letting cigarette smoke in. I choose to sit inside to stay warm and not breathe cigarette smoke. I didn't ask anyone to close the doors but I was uncomfortable enough that my girlfriend and I left early."}
{"text":"This place has awesome tacos, but if you're not a friend of the staff good luck getting served. 15 to 20 people at the bar, two bartenders on duty (or apparently on duty because they were both serving beers and shots to their friends), but if you entered and sat at a table, they were just too lazy to either greet you with a hello or even see if you wanted anything.  It's not the first time this happened. Sat and waited for about 15 to 20 minutes and then finally had enough. If you know the staff, service is quick and friendly. If you don't, it's not very welcoming. Then I guess it was my own fault for going there in the first place. I'll never be back."}
{"text":"Its our Friday night bar, hiiii  Seriously, every friday. Neighborhood bar with plenty of seating, all high top. Patio for smoking all night. Great music always.  Meal menu is average bar food but compared to places next door, since the corner panini place closed, backstage is probably your best bet for a meal. Crowd is late 20s-30s, if you want to come and drink and dance just a lil with yourself you'll fit right in."}
{"text":"Awesome food and a alright beer selection."}
{"text":"When it comes to a deal you cannot top this place..  They offer so many drink deals I often wonder how they stay in business..  The tabalupa deal they offer for most local sporting events cannot be topped...  Half of your tab for certain sporting events if the event goes in your favor.  The only down fall for me is the inside layout it does get a little crowded in the bar area.  When the patio is open the it one of the nicer ones in the area.."}
{"text":"This place is a scam! I paid a tab, while my buddy left a cash tip. The bartender got her friends to threaten us, until I put another tip on my card. Stay away from these crooks!"}
{"text":"I love backstage, it's our local neighborhood bar in westpark on kamms corner. Super cheap drinks- they have a lot of meal specials throughout the week too. They have recently started doing weeknight trivia!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere in here and the food is really great, not your \"typical\" bar food. Their selection of liquor is good and the value you get for your money can't be beat. Definitely recommend the flat bread pizzas and my hubby swears the steak is amazing.."}
{"text":"The Backstage is probably the \"hippest\" bar in Kamms Corner, mostly because the music selection is almost always pretty sweet.   Also, Keno!  I've actually had dinner here a few times, and I'm always surprised that it's really good. It's the perfect comfort food to soak up the extra drinks in your stomach: potatoes and cheese!  Speaking of overindulging and self abuse, nothing beats the ultimate throwback of smoking while drinking in a bar.  The covered back smoking patio is always nice and toasty in the winter."}
{"text":"A good place to have a few beers and some food.  Wednesday is taco night.  While they might be your average taco,  they are very tasty.  Not overwhelmed with too much spices or powdered mix.  I ordered french fries with no salt and YES they actually came the way I ordered. (not my experience at other bars)  Friends had burgers and salads and said they were really good.  I have had their wings in past visits  and they too are very tasty.  The music is also good and they have a wonderful patio.  The down side is almost no tap beer - only two taps of the weird and bad stuff. They could also use a beer special of some kind and not just rely on happy hour.   Service was sufficient.  It is a little dank and dark in there.  But don't let that scare you off. It is one of the better and less expensive joints on Kamm's corner."}
{"text":"One of my best friends likes watching the UFC fights. We decided to grab a bite to eat at Back Stage Bar before going next door to watch the violence. The menu was pretty small. The prices and value made up for it. The salads are around $6 or $7. I had the buffalo chicken salad which tasted the same as all other salads of the same name. My friend had a 8 oz. filet for $12. It came with potatoes and steamed vegetables. He said it was good, and for $12, it seemed to be a great deal. The music was very loud and made it hard to have a conversation. We really wanted to talk about the past, present and future and where our place in the world is. It could not happen with the music blaring. The music was not good either. The bartender said it was kind of quiet too. He was pissed when my friend said the music is loud. I feel that if you review any of the bars in the Kamm's corner neighborhood, you have reviewed them all. I don't like hanging around this group of people because nobody says excuse me when they walk by and generally think they are like Steven Seagal and above the law. If the visit was not at 10 pm on a Saturday, I may have enjoyed it more."}
