{"text":"Best Mexican I have ever had!  A weekly must...  Family owned and operated, great people and relaxing atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Giving this restaurant 1-star is being really generous!! First off the restaurant is small so you have no privacy and everybody can hear your conversation. Next I thought the lady working there was going to hit me cause I asked if they make homemade tortillas or not. I got the green enchiladas combo and then she comes back saying they ran out of green sauce. Then she tells me they ran out of tamales. The food portion were so small I thought it was an appetizer. There were barley enough rice and beans to cover the plate. Finally the total came out to 26 dollars for only two meals which we could've got breakfast and lunch at  Carolinas and El Norteno for the same price. The people who say this is \"authentic\" Mexican doesn't know what real Mexican food is!!"}
{"text":"The rudest staff I have ever encountered. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in 4 months and the food is still great. Potato and machaca burrito was perhaps better than the machaco and egg? I'll have to eat more of each to determine which is the winner. Always have the burritos enchilada style as Maria's enchilada sauce is great. I like that they have vegetarian options, chips are fried in vegetable oil, never lard.   Open now M-Fr, still great personal service, still a clean neat place. The food is the absolute best Mexican around."}
{"text":"Incredible fresh salsa. Get something with machaca.   Amazingly nice owner and staff.   But don't eat vegetarian here."}
{"text":"You would never think of going here by the looks. Super run down & bland looking. I would almost think it wasn't open. But the food was great. I was not expecting to have an amazing chimichanga here. Apparently they've been there for 10 years!"}
{"text":"It's a charming place to sit, but a disappointing place to eat. My fish tacos tasted strongly of freezer burn and kraft singles. There's better Mexican food in Phoenix, go find it."}
{"text":"Portion incredibly small for a 10 dollar lunch plate. Waited 30 minutes for it as well. The lady who owns the place is super sweet. Not worth 10 dollars."}
{"text":"Great quaint Mexican restaurant! Good service, great food! They have Horchata too for those who like the authentic."}
{"text":"ok food...def not thing worth driving more than 5 minutes to... i paid $6 for a burrito and a soda..not expensive but a 3 bite burrito shouldnt be 5 bucks.."}
{"text":"Do not stretch your arms out wide at this place.  It's a small joint, so I thought they would have some kick ass food.  Wellllll....because the lady who tended to us was so nice I really don't want to speak ill of the joint, but I was hoping to have some good Mexican food like I was used to having in Southern California.    When I walked in, I could smell the aromas of masa and tortillas in the air.  I thought I was back home.  Not.  The menu was colorful and had a nice variety of choices.  The basics are served here:  tamales, enchiladas, burritos, tacos and breakfast if you're there on time.    When we were all seated, we were served freshly made corn chips, fresh salsa and drinks.  I chose the chicken enchilada, beef tamale and rice & beans combo.  While waiting for my food, I noticed the restaurant had a personal touch and was kept clean.  It was small and very old, but at least the service was prompt and friendly.    My food was slightly disappointing in that it was \"ok\".  I doubt I would go back there, but I wouldn't refuse to go, if that makes any sense.  It didn't blow my dress up, so I just have to go with 3 stars."}
{"text":"My cheese enchiladas had non-melted cheese in them. That's a basic prerequisite for enchiladas - melted cheese. Not impressed at all. This place is sophomoric at best. There are far more tastier places in the valley to spend your money on. If I could leave a half star I would. I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Since I work at the airport I often am happy to have the chance to leave PHX occasionally and this place is unexpectedly a breath of aires fresca. It is a clean, small kitchen with a nice selection. I am always happy to support these locals and know my money is staying in town and not heading out of state when I pay my check. Watch out about the hours of operation, she'll close up early if it is slow. Good idea to  call ahead and let her know your plans."}
{"text":"If you blink, you might miss little Los Jarritos.  It's a tiny, free standing building with a cute little dining room.  The lady inside is nice and helpful.  I ordered the mini chimichanga with green chile beef, rice & beans.  The rice & beans were a little bland for my taste, so I mixed them together with some of the salsa, which was tasty.  The green beef was good, and the mini chimi was the perfect size for lunch.  At less than $8, it was a good value.  I will return, but I'll probably skip the sides and order a la carte."}
{"text":"If you've ever played \"Cafe World\" you will recognize this place as the first level if they had a Mexican version. One very cute petite lady running around, and taking everyone's orders, and then running in the back to cook it up....then she comes back out poised and collected, serves you calmly, and then runs back in the kitchen to cook someone else's order, only to come back in time to clear your dishes, etc...  What really endeared me to this place was the obvious pride in non-franchised ownership. The clear plastic tablecloths over the handmade lace ones...the server/cook/owner's propriety when she brought Hubs an iced tea with an actual iced tea spoon ( I hadn't seen one in years!) It all reminded me of my little Sicilian aunts and the way I imagine they ran their tiny little speakeasies (yes, I have mafia in my blood!) back in the day....  If the food had been incredible, I would've jumped on the table and danced the Macarena.....but alas, they put the \"meh\" in Mexican. I had the chile rellenos, and it came with a side of beans and rice...all fine, but forgettable.  I imagine I would LOVE this place if they had a liquor license ;)"}
{"text":"I'm stopped by here twice for lunch in the past two days. I got really delicious food for a good price. Both the chorizo breakfast burrito and machaca with eggs was really good. You can get the machaca burrito with fried eggs, potatoes or plain. I got the egg and it was delicious!   Definitely divey, but good food for a good price."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and simple, good Mexican food. Some reviews cite mediocre food, but I've always found my enchiladas perfectly cooked, my chile relleno nice and crisp, and the machaca in my chimichanga nothing but savory.   You won't be blown away by the food, but it's all SOLID, and a step up from most burrito places or diner-style Mexican. The restaurant can be small and you can find yourself waiting 30 minutes for your order to come out during the lunch rush, but it's a breath of fresh air to walk into such a simple, unpretentious restaurant run by a woman and her mother."}
