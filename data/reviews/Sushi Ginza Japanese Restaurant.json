{"text":"Mmmmmmmm Sushiiiii. My Hubby and I ordered from here last night and it was fantastic. Although, I am pretty boring when it comes to my sushi order and play it safe every time with..Cripsy California Roll, California Roll, Miso Soup, Edamame, Yam Tempura, and Dynamite roll. I called for delivery, and it was about 20 mins before they closed so they told me they could not deliver, So I went and picked it up. The man at the front was very friendly and everything was ready to go when I got there. Good prices..Tho they may be a little more pricey then other places..But it was worth it. We ate it all with no complaints. Would definitely recommend  trying Sushi Ginza out!"}
{"text":"Housed right in the Willow Park mall, this is one of the better sushi establishments you'll find in this area of the city. The restaurant has seated tables or a boat, and has lots of room so there's usually no wait.
The sushi is always consistently fresh and tasty. The service is exceptional, and we never had to go searching for our waitress."}
{"text":"This place is the 'Double Rainbow' of sushi establishments! By far one of the best sushi restaurants I have ever graced. They have some of the most unique rolls imaginable. Unless you haven't eaten for a month, one maybe two rolls is more than enough!"}
{"text":"Awesome Sushi and super attentive staff.  I've been here a few times now and I'm always impressed.  The Sushi has always been pretty fresh and the service has been really good.  I'll definitely be back a few times."}
{"text":"Gorgeous restaurant. They have every type of seating possible from rotating sushi bar to Japanese booths.

Can't compliment too much about the food though. Farmed fish isn't too fresh. Sauces are plain and innexciting"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going here for 7 years now and the sushi has always been delicious. Not once have we had a bad experience and the staff is always friendly and very quick service."}
{"text":"First time trying sushi. The staff were so pleasant and welcoming. My friend and I thought it would be fun to try something new. It was a bit overwhelming and we were totally confused. The staff was so kind. They explained and recommended dishes based on our comfort level. Ambiance is fantastic! Food is exceptional. This is a must try. Will definitely be going again."}
{"text":"Amazing place and owners! My wife and I were recently displaced from the Fort McMurray fire and were quite hungry after several days of stress and uncertainty. We both thank you from the bottom of our hearts for your kindness and generosity in the form of a complimentary sushi platter!"}
{"text":"We went to the Chinook location. Service was prompt and friendly. We started with the pork goyza (fried pork dumplings). Great flavour, nice thin dough crust .., yes we were fighting over who got the last one. 

I had combo B (chicken) and my wife had combo C (salmon). There was a lot of food. The tempura was nice, although I've never been a fan - this was actually pretty good. The chicken was really good as was the California rolls and rice.  I'm afraid to report that I didn't finish my dinner, it was just too much (sorry Mom). 

I'm sure we will be back!"}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant. I've been eating here for years and it is awesome. The fish is always fresh! It is definitely a great location to go for lunch or dinner, and you can get high quality sushi, and great service. I would recommend it. It gets busy on the weekends so make a reso or you will have to wait!"}
{"text":"I can only say great things about this place; I have been coming here for 9 years and have never been disappointed. We know the owners (who are lovely!) so we love coming here. In addition to that, they have a wonderful layout and great decor. The koi pond is beautiful, and all the traditional booths are amazing! This is a wonderful place to take anyone for a nice lunch or dinner.

The sushi here is great, my family and I are always happy and we eat a large variety of food offered. Service is fantastic and the food is always prepared promptly.

Highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I just ordered take out and I'm eating my sushi as I write this review.

You know, I'm kind of unimpressed. I haven't eaten here in a while, but I used to come here all the time because it was reasonably priced, decent, and close to home. This time, I ordered the mango roll, dynamite roll, salmon nigiri (shake) and the BBQ scallop. The nigiri is pretty good, but I'm disappointed with the rolls. The dynamite roll is literally tempura shrimp wrapped in seaweed, and rice. Where's the rest of it? My mango roll was imitation crab, avocado wrapped in seaweed, rice and little bits of mango on top... uhhh... was the sushi always like this? (Please see my uploaded picture)

The only thing saving this review from receiving 2 stars is the service. The servers there are always so nice and friendly. Thumbs up for friendliness.

{"text":"My mom and I were doing some shopping in Willow Park, and stumbled across this place. We were both feeling like sushi, so it worked out quite well that this place was nearby. We were seated quickly as we arrived right after the lunch rush. We got the Yam Tempura, Dynamite Roll, Spicy Tuna Roll and Spicy Calamari Roll. We had asked for the Yam Tempura to start, but the waitress forgot about it, so it didn't arrive until after our sushi arrived. The Yam Tempura was good, pretty generous portion, and quite crispy. The Spicy Calamari Roll was my favorite, I loved the mayo that came with it. Overall, the waitress was very friendly and the food was nice and quick."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy.  Sushi Ginza is delicious!  We got takeout with sashimi, miso soup, some rolls, and something called a Japanese salad roll (veggies wrapped in rice paper with a delicious sweet dipping sauce) that was just absolutely fantastic. 

The fish was fresh and was possibly some of the best sashimi I have had, the rolls were amazing (California roll with a chunk of crab instead of goopy shredded mayo-crab), and the miso soup had lots of yummy seaweed in it. 

The host who took my order and helped with the checkout experience was super friendly and the restaurant looked quite nice inside as well. We are hoping to dine in for our next experience at Sushi Ginza (soon - I hope!)"}
{"text":"My family has been ordering take-out from Sushi Ginza at Willow Park Village for years now.  It is always timely and incredibly fresh.  Only a couple of times have we ever experienced any problems -- its gotta be verging on +10 years by now.  

I went to Sushi Ginza for the Floating Sushi Boat this weekend for a quick dinner before a movie.  Since I knew the sushi is always great, I didn't hesitate at suggesting it to my husband for dinner. Our server was super friendly and quickly explained how their sushi bar worked.  The sushi on the boats was higher end sushi, compared to other sushi bars where they put their cheapest fish or California rolls on constantly. I got to try a couple rolls I have never ordered from take-out before so that was a plus.  We also ordered a couple menu items and the sushi was made lightning fast.  I could not even believe how fast they prepared our Hotate Special!  Mere minutes!  It wasn't long before we were full and had a healthy stack of sushi plates in front of us.  Our server quickly got us our bill and we were on our way.  I noticed a huge line-up for tables but hardly anyone was sitting at the sushi bar.  Probably only 2 or 3 other couples.  If you go and there is a line, I totally recommend sitting at the sushi bar...its just as ambient and you get to watch the sushi chefs create!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi and awesome atmosphere, the 1st boat in town I believe?
Took my friend from California here way back when and he loved it as did we!
You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Craving sushi and being at South Centre mall, we decided to check out Sushi Ginza. It has such good reviews that how could we not? 

We got sat in a quiet little booth out of the way from the rest which was nice. Our waitress was very eager to please but it got quite bothersome after a while. She must have walked over to our table at least 30 times to ask us if we needed water, more beer, more food, are we done, etc... (When we just got our food - she must have come by every 5 mins to ask until we were actually finished) It got annoying because really I just wanted to eat.

What we ordered was good, Beef Tataki (delicious and a large portion) and a few maki rolls.... However I thought the rolls to be standard... nothing really stood out to me. 
I wouldn't mind going back but only if I was in the area and there was no other options."}
{"text":"Delicious! Was the first place I ever had sushi at ten years ago, went back today on a whim and really enjoyed it! We were at the floating sushi boat bar. All the sushi was very fresh, and there were some very interesting flavor combinations in the rolls and the sushi that we really enjoyed. One of the pros of the floating boat bar is trying new things from what you see instead of reading from the menu. We also had a great view of the chefs creating rolls and even picked some dishes right from them. For how good it was the price was fairly reasonable. We'd go again :)"}
{"text":"My sister loves this place, so I went with her and my nephew one day to check it out. Their vegetarian combo platter had a sushi roll with eggs in it, so I asked if they could just replace it with an avocado roll. The waitress told me she'd ask the chef, and when she came back, she told me they wouldn't do it because they \"don't do swap-outs\" for the combo platters. I lied and told her I had an egg allergy, so she asked again and they complied. When the food came out, it was very ho-hum. Huge amounts of rice and the tiniest hint of a vegetable in the middle. Superstore has better portioned sushi.

Another time, we came in with my parents, and my Dad asked if he could have a fried egg with his dish. The waitress said she'd ask the chef, and when she came back, she told him that the chef refused to do it because they were too busy for special requests. I looked around, and there were only 2 other patrons aside from us. 

The Willowpark location is MUCH better, with a better menu and more accommodating staff. I'm told the Chinook location's service has improved considerably since my last 2 visits, but I don't really want to deal with a place where the chef refuses to do special requests of any kind."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday dinner, albeit after 9pm. I was treated by a friend with the Sushi Boat for two with soup and salad.

The boat took about 20 minutes to arrive but when it docked, I thought, wow, I should go boating more often. Oh wait, back to the food. Several piece of California Roll, Salmon Roll, Cucumber Roll, several sets of 2 piece of nigri including Salmon, Tuna, and ebi, multiple pieces of sashimi including salmon, red tuna, tuna, and 4 pieces of some really large roll that contained salmon, tuna, imitation crab meat and orange roe on top. I forgot a few of the pieces but my tummy has not. Hmmm, every piece of fish was so fresh. Did I mention I got the Beef Tataki appetizer? Oh wait, I did not. Well I did and that was so good with the ponzu sause and onions flavoring the Alberta beef (I love you, Alberta).

The miso soup was just perfectly warm and not too salty. The salad was nice if a little small (would like to see cucumbers and onions in it as well) but this is not a salad bar.

I recognized our waiter from another establishment I had frequented so I knew I was going to get excellent service and of course, I did.

Being the last customers of the evening made the experience even better.

I love the decor. Classy and elegant but not overbearing. Comfortable ambiance without intruding on other customers.

Thank you for making my birthday dinner a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Very nice and interesting Japanese decor, with a bridge and ponds of koi inside the restaurant! Very courteous staff! Very fresh fish! A variety of cutting that I haven't seen before - knowledgeable sushi chefs! Interesting Japanese style box seating. Huge display cabinets with very interesting Japanese items for enjoyment."}
{"text":"Well, I just paid $14 for a Caterpillar roll that was filled with canned tuna. To be fair the salmon pieces I got were good, but that caterpillar abomination should be removed from the menu."}
{"text":"We have been doing date night at Ginza for about 8 years. Things I love: Good quality sushi, amazing atmosphere, always have a table open, prompt service, and good presentation. 

The food: I think the sushi is as good as any I've had in Calgary. Nothing compared of Vancouver, but still very good. The selection on the menu pretty good and we usually order from the sushi menu plus one or two of the special rolls. Whatever I've ordered off the menu has been delicious and presented beautifully. One criticism I would have is that the menu hasn't changed a lot over the past few years, but that could be taken as a good thing too, depending on what you like. 

The atmosphere: what I love about this place is the restaurant itself! There is a sushi bar with floating boats, a little pond with fish, and a display case full of Japanese sushi and tea dishware. The decoration is splendid. 

Overall: one other thing is that no matter when I have come, I've never had to wait for a table. The place isn't huge, but there is no waiting for great sushi! If you haven't tried this place, I would highly recommend it. It has become a standard for our date nights."}
{"text":"Went to Sushi Ginza with my 11 year old son for lunch.  He was hoping to sit at the sushi bar, but it was not working for Sunday lunch.

We started with gyoza and miso soup.  The soup came out quickly and was very good.  The gyoza had clearly sat in the pickup counter for a while and arrived on the cool side.

Our sushi assortment was adequate.  The spicy salmon was a little mushy, so disappointing.  The California roll, on the other hand, was tasty with a nice cucumber crunch.  The rest were perfectly acceptable.

Overall, ignoring the spicy salmon, the experience was fine. Sushi Ginza was expensive, but it will remain in our boys' lunch rotation (just not a first choice)."}
{"text":"The sushi is good and the service is also good, however on two visits to this restaurant my husband and then best friend experienced stomach issues afterwards. Not exactly food poisoning but still issues. Its a super convenient location for me so I am very disappointed I wont be going back."}
{"text":"Nothing but good things to say about this place! We went on New Years Eve (without a reservation) but we were still offered a space at the sushi bar. We were seated right away and placed our orders; we had the vegetable tempura, \"Mt. Fuji\" rolls (BEST ever), salmon sashimi and dumplings. We shared everything and loved it all! Would definitely go back again. The staff are very friendly and the service is prompt. The dishes are moderately priced and it's great value & quality for what you pay."}
{"text":"Substandard food compared to many of other Japanese places in town. We can't express how rude the service was and again poor food. We certainty won't be back."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Always greet me by name. Very good effort. Food is great and homemade sweet soy is amazing! i eat here a couple times a week at least. There is nothing in the south that compares. Kinjo comes close. Keep up the good work guys."}
{"text":"Sushi Ginza if our go to sushi spot in the south, it's located in the Willow Park business district right off McLeod Trail so there's plenty of free parking. The restaurant has a pretty basic interior with private booths or tables. The staff are usually quite attentive and I find the service pretty quick.

There is a good selection of rolls to order from and then the menu items as well. We usually order green tea, tempura, rolls and then hubs adds on something else for himself. The quality is consistent and I always leave very full."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 stars, probably the nicest sit-down sushi place close by to the big mall.  Located in a big plaza with nicer, typical stores but I digress.

Ordered the cali roll for takeout, and nice they asked how many chopsticks though thought it was obvious lol.

Real nice decor for a neighbourhood sushi joint, in my  humble opinion.  Layout is a bit odd, with the washrooms facing you as you enter, right beside the hostess.

Does have some private seating on the left.  

Worth going back again, and yes, date worthy.

they offer delivery."}
{"text":"I recently discovered this gem in my neighbourhood . The sushi is great, the selection of hot sake is good & the service is exceptional. My family & friends that live further away prefer to come south for this sushi. The ambiance is lovel: you can choose from a table, a booth or a low traditional table where you take off your shoes & sit zashiki style. Or eat at the sushi bar, where you can observe the sushi chefs perform their art & eat from the boats drifting around the sushi river. The restaurant is big (I think this is the former Ginger Beef location) but it still manages to have a cozy atmosphere. There is even a wooden bridge that crosses over a koi pond. I highly recommend for good sushi, lovely surroundings & an overall enjoyable experience!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Sushi Ginza - both this location and the one in Willowpark - for several years now. I am sad to say that my experience has become increasingly dissatisfying with each successive visit.

The place was bustling when my companions and I arrived. We understood that service would be a little slow until the supper rush cleared. However, service remained slow even after the first rush cleared out.

Two of my companions and I each ordered a Sushi Combo B while the fourth member in our party ordered a Tonkatsu Curry Rice Bowl. 

It was mediocre. Actually, it reminded me of the sushi take-out you can get at Sobey's. Only I would have paid $9.99 instead of $14.95. The California Rolls were passable but not great. The Tako sushi made my tummy roll over while the Tuna sushi remained as mushy as the last time I ate a tuna sushi there.

As for the Tonkatsu Curry, my friend said that it wasn't exactly bland. \"Flavorful but not spicy\" enough for his liking.

We never did get our water. 

There are definitely better sushi joints in town. As for Sushi Ginza, the days of long ago when the tonkatsu was plump, juicy and flavorful; the service attentive and the parking was stellar are just a fading memory.

Minus 1 star for mediocre food. Minus another for mediocre service, although I get the sense some of my companions might even deduct another 1/2 star."}
{"text":"Delicious! And such a cute location I'm always excited to go in and see the river! Staff are always friendly and food is consistently good!"}
{"text":"I like this sushi place. It has pretty good sushi. We got the toro sushi, yellow tail sushi, unagi sushi, flames roll, bc roll and spicy salmon roll, chopped scallop roll and sashimi pizza and Sashimi. 

The Salmon Sashimi was really fresh. Its thinly cut but each piece was really big. So it has this nice sweet taste to it. 

The toro was nice. I found it cut too thin. Unagi sushi was amazing. The unagi was so big. Flames roll was not bad. I liked the fact it had sweet chili sauce. Chopped Scallop roll was yummy. Lots of scallop but I did find it too much mayo. I think they kind of over did it. 
The sashimi pizza was delicious. I loved how the rice was fried and so it had a really nice crunch to it.  BC roll and spicy salmon roll were ok. 

I like the décor of this place. They have a glass cabinet with interesting things inside. I mean its pretty cool to look at. Service was pretty good here. We sat in a very hidden corner but our server came quite often to check on it. She was very friendly. 

There are plenty of parking here. I mean it is located in an open mall."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never reviewed this location. If my memory serves me right, this was the place that I tried sushi for the very first time. In following with that tradition, I decided it was time to introduce my children to the taste of Japan. Needless to say, they have become huge fans. Attentive staff, value inspired menu, and amongst the freshest sushi in Calgary, I would recommend Sushi Ginza to sushi lovers of all experience levels.

{"text":"We are always trying new sushi restaurants and Ginza did not disappoint. A great ambience, fresh fish, sushi not loaded down with rice. Really good. We were very pleased."}
