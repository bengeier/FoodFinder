{"text":"Came here for a quick dinner before watching a movie. The restaurant was very accommodating since we were on a tight schedule and made sure that our food came quickly. We had 3 pasta dishes, all delicious, and a New York strip that was cooked to perfection. 
Great little gem in Lasalle. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Visited this beautiful little-known Italian gem in Lasalle, Montreal this weekend. Extensive menu ranging from pasta, risotto, seafood, chicken, to steak. I am vegetarian and I eat gluten-free. I was impressed with the flavourful gluten-free arabiatta spaghetti and the salad appetizer which you can add for only 2$ with any meal. The other members of my group turned their meals into a table d'h√¥te (soup or salad, dessert and tea or coffee) for just 6$ addition to any meal. Two group members that had the salmon said it was the best salmon they've ever eaten. Desserts were delicious too! The ambiance and mood are very pleasant and prices are inexpensive for a restaurant with white tablecloths. Good service. Lots of free parking as it is in a mini-mall. Can't wait to come back once weather is a little nicer and outdoor terrasse is open. Overall great experience. Try it - You won't be disappointed"}

{"text":"Second time here and both times the food and service just blew us away. Food cooked with love and passion, wait staff that is quick, on the ball and go out of their way to make sure that you have an excellent experience. 

Love this place! Highly recommend it."}
