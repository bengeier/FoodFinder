{"text":"l'atelier comfortably accommodated a group of ten for a birthday party. 

we were the second seating, and while the restaurant wasn't packed, nor did it seem desolate. 

our server was a peach, obliged a split Anglo/Franco group masterfully, and went the extra mile. 

while I admit we were eying other more popular BYOW restaurants in the area, everyone was glad we gave atelier the chance. 

We all had the 5 course table d'hote/group menu and not one of us left disappointed. 

would recommend."}
{"text":"Needless to say, L'Atelier was the ABSOLUTE WORST restaurant experience of my life. The food is way below mediocre, and the service is simply deplorable. There were few choices, and it was exptremely difficult to even choose what to have, and service, from staff to the owner were way below standard and practically unsanitary, our waiter had such a long thick beard I was worried for hairs in my food. 
For the entrees, the deer tatake was chewy, the poached oysters were so terrible everyone at the table had to spit them out into their napkins, they were cold, the sauce was cold and their paring with bacon made for a very bad combination. 
For the mains, not even one out of four enjoyed their dish. The entrecote was way undercooked, we asked for medium and got very rare; the lamb was dry on the outside and tasted like it had been in freezer a little too long; the scallops were way undercooked, my friend actually got sick from them; and the absolute worse was the catch of the day which came with some kind of foamy scummy sauce which had such a terrible odor it was unedible. 
THE ABSOLUTE WORST APRT OF ALL THIS besides the terrible food, was the owner of the establishment, Felix Tremblay, who when we politely complained was rude and condecending. We requested to have one of the meals removed off the bill and he even went so far as to CALL THE POLICE on us when we refused to pay the dish. 
He clearly has no sense of customer service and must be evry desperate for 30$ if he is willing to embarass himself in front of a restaurant full of clients. 
Of course we did not pay the bill and we will NEVER be returning. 
Eat there at your own risk...."}
{"text":"sorry to say I did not have a good experience at L'atelier.

We were a group so we had a set meal to choose from, which was HEAVILY laden with meat. I don't have anything against meat but when each course (except for desert) is meat centered and every option is meat centered its a bit much. There was no way to choose around this. 

I had to settle for instead of 4 courses to get 3, with a overdressed salad, but still paid the same price as people who were getting 4 courses of meat. 

The food in general was not outstanding for the price you pay.

The waiter was not very friendly either. seemed more interested in hanging out with his friends who were at the restaurant as well."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant on St. Laurent. The mains were priced nicely, the appetizers were a bit expensive for what was served. The duck poutine wasn't really worth the price. The food was flavourful."}
{"text":"Impressionnant pour un apportez votre vin! Nourriture impeccable et très belle ambiance.. Tout le monde à apprécie ( groupe de 12)... J'ai toujours cette impression que parfois un apportez votre vin, tu ne peux pas retrouver à 100% la même qualité de nourriture mais définitivement faux dans ce cas. Seul hic mais compréhensible, service 18 h ou 21 h... Donc à mon avis trop tôt ou trop tard, on a pris le 18 h et il a fallu quitter en vitesse!"}
{"text":"J'aime beaucoup ce petit resto du Mile-End déjà pour sa nourriture qui est très bonne et vraiment très fine. Il parait que c'est de la bouffe Française même si j'ai jamais goûté de côtes levées de bison en France, mais passons sur les détails... L'important c'est que c'est bon! Jusqu'ici je n'ai jamais été déçue par le service même si j'ai vu dans d'autres commentaires que ça pouvait être inégal. A vous de vous faire votre opinion sur le sujet je suppose, mais bon en tout cas, moi j'ai toujours trouvé que ça allait. Ah et puis notez bien que c'est un Apportez votre vin."}
{"text":"Bring your own wine. That is awesome. If you forgot to bring a bottle, there's a liquor store on the same street only two blocks away. 

The servers and host/hotess were all very friendly. A few didn't speak English so it was difficult to help us translate what was on the menu. 

The food was really good except for the salad with kimchi, bacon, and microgreens. I know Kimchi. That was no Kimchi. It was basically subtle kimchi flavored cabbages tossed with micro greens and bacon in a bowl. Avoid this."}
{"text":"I had a lovely experience at L'Atelier when out with a pack of 12 lady friends celebrating a bachelorette. The space is lovely - small enough to feel cozy, but with ample space between tables so everything feels spacious and calm. We were seated at a huge gorgeous wood table and, in my opinion, the service was exceptional. We were a bilingual chatty (read: loud) group, lots of pregnant ladies and people with dietary restrictions, lots of getting up to switch places, and the staff were friendly, chill and helpful throughout. The food was very refined and universally MMMMmmmmMMmed over all up and down the table - lots of local product on the menu which is reinvented constantly depending on what's fresh. It's pricey, but you save money bringing your own wine and end up spending less than at comparable places that aren't byo. I'd definitely keep it high on my list for this type of event."}
{"text":"Perhaps a little pricey for the portion size but bringing out own wine helped, and the quality and flavours were truly incredible. The salmon sashimi was quite possibly the best fish I have ever tasted, and the pork came with little pork cubes on the side that were to die for. Our server was so lovely and friendly too!"}
