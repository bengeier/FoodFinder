{"text":"New spot in Uptown and it is exactly what's been needed here for a long time. I travel to Charlotte quite often and while it's a pleasant city, the dining scene leaves a lot to be desired. Angeline's is hands down going to fill that void. The room is beautiful, the food is on point and the cocktail program was put together by someone who is in touch with the trends of larger/more advanced drinking cities. I went on opening night and it was packed. There were small clues that it was their first night but the overall experience was spot on. Shout out to Ron for the great service. Whole fish, sausage pizza and frito misto are all highly recommended."}
{"text":"Came in on Wednesday with a few friends and had a good time. Drinks were delicious, food was average as well as the service! I had the soup for my appetizer (which was horrible) and the chicken for my dinner which was great just lacked in seasoning. My server was Alex who seemed like we were bothering her throughout the experience. I had an encounter with Tenay who was very Very nice and knowledgeable about the menu and able to answer all the questions our sever wasn't able to. Hopefully when I decide to come in again on a date night I'll have her as a server! Thanxxs"}
{"text":"Overcharged my card. Muscles were mushy and gritty. Didn't receive part of the food order. They spilled a full drink on the guy sitting next to me.  Every time I talk to the manager they are \"too busy\" to review why my card was overcharged. I left a voicemail with no return call. Called again and talked to the manager 3 different times about the issue and the only response I get is the managers are busy and their system is cumbersome and takes time to review. It's been a month!  They also told me mushy and gritty muscles are of a higher quality than what you're used to getting at other restaurants.  Maybe they forgot about the rest of the food order because I didn't get an excuse or acknowledgement for that issue."}
{"text":"No idea why this place only has 3 1/2 stars. Is a definite five. The wait staff is very friendly and the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"Ok. Those who might read my reviews know I'm honest even if it means I'm harsh.  This place was terrific.  Great service,  very nice people and what we ordered terrific.  Not high end food but what they offer is great.  Thanks.  Your place to eat Charlotte."}
{"text":"This review is for Friends and Family Brunch Weekend 1/28/18.  I had the opportunity to try out their newly developed brunch menu. After brunch we provided feedback for quality of food and service. I would go back to try the carbonara and would love to try the craft cocktails.  The brunch menu is lengthy. It was hard to decide. For my brunch visit, I had the following dishes:  Avocado Toast-Avocado Toast Avocado Mousse, Ciabatta, Fried Prosciutto, Calabrian Aioli- ciabatta, sturdy enough to hold the mousse. avocado mousse, smooth as a mousse should be but I'd prefer a bit more texture in this case. I'm the first to preach about the importance of lime juice or lemon juice to cut the fat of an avocado but in this case, there was a bit too much. fried prosciutto was crispy, a welcomed contrast to the smooth texture of the mousse and aioli. calabrian  ( pepper) aioli- mild, more mayonnaise flavor. My wish was for my spice in the aioli.   Banana Bread French Toast Whipped Sorghum Butter, Compressed Strawberries, Candied Pecans-I wanted more flavor. I will compare the taste to a banana muffin. I longed for crispy edges that I love  from a perfectly cooked piece of French toast.   House Selections of Salumi & Cheeses, House Giardiniera, Fig Jam, Breads- the cheese selection varies by chef's choice. The jam was delicious!   Whipped Ricotta  Sourdough, Lavender Honey, Pistachio-one of my faves. An impressive balance of flavor. The lavender wasn't as present as I would've liked.  *Hash16 Braised Oxtail, Caramelized Onions, Bell Peppers, Taleggio Fonduta, Rosemary Potatoes, Sunny Up Eggs-another fave. I shared this dish with one of my tablemates. The kitchen staff kindly separated the dish into two bowls for us. More oxtail, less potatoes. The egg was cooked nicely.  Chocolate Cake 9 Smoked Sea Salt Ganache, Fernet Cherry-I love chocolate! On a different day, I may have eaten more of this dessert but today, it was too rich for me. The cherry served as a garnish and didn't add anything to the dish. This is a shareable dessert."}
{"text":"They are now open for lunch which is perfect for our lunch outings.... the ricotta app is a must! It even holds well if you can't finish to eat for later. The environment is fresh and relaxing. Service was great .... minus the wait for a host to seat us. It's an awkward way to enter with no one actually at the door. The mussels are another must. I was enjoying everything so I forgot pictures."}
{"text":"Visiting Charlotte from NYC and decided to check  out Angeline's with my sister. We had dinner reservations at 8:45 last night (Saturday) and once we entered we were greeted politely by the hostess however our table wasn't ready so we went to grab a drink at the bar.   Bar  After waiting 5 mins to be acknowledged by the bartender (the bar was full but not overly busy, just people waiting for their reserved tables) I asked the bartender about their cocktails and what he would recommend, he had NO opinion and said the menu was new. I was slightly taken back that the bartender had no opinion nor suggestion on any bar drinks on their menu. I am paying New York and LA prices for a drink and you aren't selling it to me. ($16 for a drink) Luckily I ordered something based on my preference of alcohol and it ended up being great. The experience at the bar was very disappointing, hopefully they will staff another bartender on Friday and Saturday nights as the two there seemed to be very overwhelmed, which reflected their ability to provide great customer service.   We were sat around 9:15 -- The restaurant was barely 2/3 of the way full and waited 30mins to be seated after our reservation time.   Dinner Our dinner was good, the food came out very quickly we ordered the Bolognese and the Chop Salad. I would suggest both! My sister wasn't overly impressed by dinner but I thought it was good. The service at the table was great, he was very friendly however the waiter didn't greet our table for 4 minutes, which in this situation is a very long time. We ordered Bar drinks right away and received  them a few minutes before our food arrived, again the bar was struggling to get drinks out.   More than likely I will never visit Angeline's again, the customer service is lacking and the food isn't making up for it. This restaurant has a lot of potential however they need to work out the kinks.."}
{"text":"Went to Angeline's for a birthday dinner last night. Staff was very attentive and friendly. Really enjoyed the food and atmosphere, however my only complaint would be the food temperature. For an appetizer I had the fried calamari, for my entree I had the linguine with clams and for dessert, the chocolate cake (meh). Dishes were satisfying, just not as hot as I would anticipate. Definitely worth a second trip."}
{"text":"We took our friend here for a birthday dinner and they treated her like absolute royalty.  Our server was personal and informative. The sommelier was extremely helpful in aiding us along in our wine selection. The olive tapenade that came with our bread was the best we've ever had and the rest of our meal didn't disappoint. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Solid. I'd really say this is a 4.5 but Yelp doesn't give me that option (or I haven't figured it out yet). Oxtail pasta was al dente, well seasoned, and almost silky. Enjoyed the ricotta app, which could have made a nice dessert too with the perfect drizzle of lavender honey on top. Spit Roasted Chicken was spot on temperature wise - always a risk with chicken - and the smooth sauce and sweetly charred brussels made for a great bite. Ron our server was a veteran with charm, knowledge and good wit."}
{"text":"Their $9 pineapple cake is really a flourless tort and yuk! A cake has flour. The sorbet and sauce was good but a $3 cupcake has more flavor and is worth the price. Overpriced salad but it was good and the shoestring fries were well seasoned. I'll skip this place next time I'm in uptown Charlotte."}
{"text":"First of all: hahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahaha.............omg. Can you believe this place?!!!! This is an embarrassment to Italian food. I had a chopped salad. I swear it was all of 2 leaves of Romain with some pine nuts. ($12) I asked for the \"power of love\" cocktail minus egg white. The bartender was confused and said they could not make it without egg whites. ...... she eventually realized how absurd that sounded and then she served it in a tiny glass to get back at me..........what??!!! Really??!! I can't stop laughing......How are all these people at the bar so overweight?????? The appetizer portions are microscopic!!!!  We had one cocktail, one beer, one TINY chopped salad and the mussels. Bill was $45. What?!!!!??? I'm going to stop at Wendy's on my way home. This is stupid....I'm still soooo hungry....i mean hangry.   The drink without the egg white and the arrabiata sauce were good."}
{"text":"The ambiance of this restaurant is TO DIE FOR!!!! Absolutely love the vibe that you get from this place. As soon as you walk in the lights are dim, you can see the chefs do their work and that wine wall is gorg! The staff is friendly and they know the menu pretty well. So if you have any questions, they know the answer. The waiters/waitresses also give good recommendations also. When the food comes out, I kid you not, it looks like something out of a magazine. They care about food presentation, which should be number one at any restaurant. I've had this place on my radar ever since they opened (For My Wedding) and I am glad I went. If you are contemplating on going here.....STOP YOUR WAITING MAKE A RESERVATION ALREADY. You will not regret it."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere. Industrial meets posh NYC. Located inside a hotel, but not a classic hotel restaurant. Service was 4 star, not 5 - but they are new, so give that some time.  Best on the menu: WOOD FIRE ROASTED BRANZINO, a whole fish cooked with head and tail on, served as such, with Roasted Red Pepper Coulis, Tapenade, Roasted Cauliflower, Salmon Roe  AMAZING!!!!  For an app, i really loved the BRANZINO CRUDO, Grapefruit, Fregola, Cold Pressed Olive Oil - Very refreshing and not heavy.  Other contenders for main courses:  PUMPKIN AGNOLOTTI Ricotta, Spiced Pepitas, Collards, Hen of the Woods  CAPESANTE Pan Seared Scallops, Braised Mustard Greens, Smoked Ham Hock Jus, Prosciutto Chip  Drinks to try!  POWER OF LOVE Bourbon, Ginger, Rosso Vermouth, Lemon, Egg White  A LONG PLACE IN THE SUN (My fave!) Cynar, Madeira, Lemon, Rosemary  THE GODFATHER'S GODSON Laphroaig 10yr, Amaretto, Fernet Branca, Kahlua"}
{"text":"I visited Angeline's on Friday night with my family. The decor is impressive, and the food did not disappoint. My favorite was the Melanzane Alla Parmigiana (eggplant, fresh mozzarella, pomodoro, crispy black kale). I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I dined here on a Tuesday night and couldn't believe how crowded it was!!! Luckily, after waiting for about 5 minutes, I was able to snag a seat at the bar.  I started off with a glass of red wine (2015 Nero d'avila, Calea) and the whipped ricotta appetizer, which consisted of grilled sourdough bread surrounding a beautifully plated mixture of ricotta, lavender honey and pistachio.  I thought it was delicious (subtle hints of honey), but I would have liked for the bread to have been warm and a bit more of it so that the bread:ricotta cheese ratio was better balanced.  Something was missing though between the rich, creamy ricotta and the bland bread.  I was surprisingly full after this, but as always, had room for dessert! I decided on the classic Italian dish, tiramisu.  One of the bartenders seemed to forget about my order, so after about 10 minutes I had to kindly remind him.  The tiramisu was layered high and was topped with an espresso whip with edible gold.  It was just okay. It was the americanized version of tiramisu and was lacking a strong flavor.  For the whipped ricotta, glass of wine and dessert, my bill was about $35.  That is on the high side considering that I did not order a main meal."}
{"text":"Decided to try Angeline's for new years even though I've heard some mixed reviews. My overall opinion on the restaurant was okay. The restaurant looked nice and the service was great. They had they're prefixed new years menu which had some good options. The appetizers were good but the main course we both ordered the ribeye medium rare and when we got it the dish was cold and both ribeyes were pretty rare which I don't mind but I would like what I ordered for a restaurant this nice. The veggies on the plate were also cold which made the dish all together disappointing. The flavor was good and I'm sure if I asked they would have made us a new dish but seemed like too much trouble. The dessert dishes were decent, the chocolate cake was okay just a little too bitter and the mousse I ordered was pretty good. The cocktails were really good also. I would give them another try with the regular menu to compare but maybe wait a while before I go back since they are fairly new."}
{"text":"I received great service from the bar by Maddie and Marshall...they provided professional service, pleasant conversation, and amazing cocktails. The polpette mash potato pizza is my FAV, I cant help but get it every time. Sit at the bar, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I came here two weeks after their opening and I was very impressed with their food and service! The waitress was very knowledgeable even though it was a new menu, all of the meat entrees within our group were tender, and the ambience was very sexy. The mixed drinks here are perfect!  Great bartenders and the Power of Love mixed drink is a must try!"}
{"text":"Came in after 10pm on a Friday night. My SO and I had just checked in to the Kimpton hotel and wanted to grab a bite to eat without going too far from the hotel. The hotel staff members directed us where to enter. When we walked in, it wasn't clear to us where we were supposed to go. It looked like a nice enough restaurant where you wait to be seated, so we decided to stand near the other entrance.  After standing there, confused for a few minutes, a friendly face finally greeted us. We told the hostess we heard from the hotel that they close at 11 and asked if they still have full service. She informed us that they only serve pizza between 10pm-11pm. We were fine with that then we asked to sit at the bar.  The restaurant staff quickly cleaned off and prepared our section. The three bartenders (2 males and 1 female) took very good care of us. They were very friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable. My SO asked for a drink with whiskey, something similar to an old fashioned. The bartender suggested a boulevardier ($11+), composed of whiskey, vermouth, and campari. My SO decided to try that. I ordered the rossini ($11), which is prosecco with strawberry. The SO really enjoyed his cocktail, so much so that he tried to order it again at another bar. My rossini was refreshing as expected.  I ordered the carbonara pizza ($16) and the SO the confit potato ($16). Both pizzas came out as described. However, both were too salty for my liking. I love pizza and usually don't mind the saltiness of it, but this was almost overwhelming. Even the egg on my pizza was too salty! It was late and I was hungry after traveling, so I slowly but surely worked my way to finishing my personal pizza. The salt level didn't seem to bother my SO. He actually enjoyed his pizza.   The place is new, just opened on November 1st. It's clean and beautifully and carefully decorated. I am curious enough to come back and try other items on their menu. I do not think I will be ordering any of their pizzas again."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great.  Service wonderful.  Food average.  Portions ridiculously small for the $$$$  Recommendation to owner: rebrand as Italian tapas, lower price some of each dish and TELL ME I need to order 3 dishes for a complete meal."}
{"text":"I ordered oxtail pasta and it wasn't all that cracked up to be. My husband ordered something that looked like hamburger meat with vegetables. They were overpriced dishes with uncooked pasta and nothing but blend taste. There's a first for everything this will be the first and last to be in this restaurant. The three stars are for the service , waiter was awesome and the staff but the food was 1 star service. Save the disappointment and Make a trip to another restaurant nearby."}
{"text":"Love this place. Usually great food (although some dishes can be a bit off). Service is typically great and the ambiance is some of the best in charlotte."}
{"text":"This is a very good hotel restaurant so it is open breakfast, lunch, dinner and late meals. The Charlotte food scene is great but has limited hours."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant, the food and atmosphere were very good. Aiesha the host of the restaurant was very welcoming. I'd come back just to say HI to her! Joe is very nice and knowledgable about his wine along with the great management Adrienne took very good care of us. Tyler was our waiter and made sure we were well taken care of us. We'll be back next time revisit Charlotte."}
{"text":"Two stars because the food was very good. Unfortunately, we'll never return because of the service. After 30 minutes waiting for our checks (after overhearing our server say he was going to be in 'Check hell' for splitting 5 checks), another server came over and gave us one check and said their system didn't allow them to split checks. Our first server couldn't have told us that in the first 5 minutes of trying? Plenty of other great food in Charlotte (pasta at Customshop and Flourshop), no need to return with service like that. Beware if you're a group trying to pay with more than one card!"}
{"text":"Kelli Brennan ! Wow this place made my day! First time in Charlotte! Best place ever! Amazing drinks and food! Kelly is the sweetest!  The Power of Love! Drink is soooo good! Must visittttttt!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great alternative when the line for merchant and trade is too long. We stopped in to have some drinks here instead. The drinks are nothing memorable, but what was memorable was the attitude of the bar tenders. I understand you're a brand new restaurant in the new hotel in town, but, remember the town is Charlotte NC, not NYC. We sampled two of the pizzas also, again disappointing, the potato pizza lacked any real flavor, and both pizzas just left a bitter aftertaste in our mouths from the charred bits of crap stuck to the bottom of the crusts. I think next time, just stick to waiting in line to go upstairs."}
{"text":"This place has the potential of being a true gem in Charlotte Uptown Crown! I went for lunch and was in the mood for seafood and they definitely delivered! I saw at the bar and I'm sorry if don't remember the bartenders name but they were awesome! We talked as is if we known each other for years. I ordered he fried calamari and mussels. The fried calamari was perfectly fried and seasoned to perfection they serve it with a mayonnaise based sauce That was delicious. The mussels were prepared in a tomato based sauce that had just enough kick too it and came with 2 pieces of toasted bread which went great with sauce.  They have a great outdoor seating if the weather permits.  Can't wait to go back and try the lamb meal!"}
{"text":"I went to Angeline's with my girlfriend on Saturday night. We sat at the bar because it was so busy so I didn't have a complete dining experience. Our bartender was very friendly and helpful in recommending dishes. The ambience and decor inside was very cool. I thought the food was good. I wouldn't say it was amazing but definitely good. For the price I was hoping for better food, but I'd probably go back again. We ordered the calamari and the cioppino to start. Both were good but preferred the cioppino. Next we had the oxtail pasta and the scallops. They past was good but the scallops were by far our favorite dish. They also have a decent wine and drink menu."}
{"text":"This restaurant is beautifully decorated, dimly lit and cozy and everyone who works there is super friendly and warm. We tried the Carbonara pizza, the Osso bucco and the Pappardelle pasta. I chose \"The Power of Love\" cocktail, and am not a huge fan of bourban, but it was really tasty and enjoyable. All the food was delicious. I would highly suggest one of the pizzas as an appetizer! I can't wait to come back and try different dishes. (PS Merchant and Trade rooftop bar is in the same building, so it was great to get after dinner drinks up there.)"}
{"text":"Given yes it was the first week they were open, however, appetizers were extremely delayed, salad was wilted, Filet severely over cooked. Brussels sprouts were pretty good but almost anyone can roast Brussels and put a decent glaze on them. Not a place I plan on returning for a while. I'll give them 6 months or so to work the kinks out and try again but don't get your hopes up in the interim."}
{"text":"We decided to dine here after attending a show on a Friday night. This was probably my first big disappointment here in CLT. The have an entrance through the hotel and they also have their own entrance(which they weren't using at this time due to it being a really cold night). Upon entering, the ambiance and decor is really good. The place looks great so kudos in that area.   They were fairly busy when we went, but were able to be seated quickly which was nice. The waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu and gave a few recommendations. We ordered a Bellini, Pork Shank and the Ox Tail pasta. Unfortunately, both of these dishes were pretty flavorless. Not only were they bland, but the portion sizes were tiny. I do not typically mind smaller portion sizes as long as those bites are really well done, but that just was not the case here. The total was around $80, which is also fine for a fine dining establishment, but this felt like a complete waste of money. Maybe it was just an off night, but currently I could only suggest visiting here for the ambiance and maybe to grab a few drinks."}
{"text":"The reason they are getting one star is because I will not go and eat there because you have to pay $18 to valet park. There are dozens of restaurants in the Uptown area and all of them offer complimentary valet parking. Charging $18 to come eat at your restaurant is absurd you guys are going to lose a lot of business over this."}
{"text":"The ambiance and service here was great, however, the food wasn't as good as we expected for the price. We came with a big group (about 9) and had reservations, so we had a great table and very nice waitress. We ordered the calamari and ricotta cheese for appetizers, which were the highlight of the meal. Several of us got pizzas, but the favorite by far was the half chicken or the pasta with bolognese. We didn't sit outside, but if you're going, id recommend sitting outside and getting just drinks and appetizers."}
{"text":"Huge fan of Kimpton- came for Merchant and Trade, but were told we needed reservations. Went to dinner instead. Service was spotty but it's opening night.  Queen City salad delicious, full of flavor.  Branzino crudo -very strange dish, components never melded together and I LOVE crudo!!   Husband's risotto ok, lacked flavor and not really risotto, just rice with a leek sauce.  Shared broccolini, overly salty taleggio cheese & too much salt- broccolini way over roasted (burnt, really). Will go back for another try and hope they improve as it could be a great addition to Charlotte dining scene."}
{"text":"I wish I could give it more stars! I will start off by saying, the service is amazing. The manager was very attentive, extremely polite and in the end attempted to make things right. The restaurant itself is beautiful, its large and the sound proofing is top notch that being the case. There was not a seat available, everyone was talking and eating but I could clearly hear my friend at the table. All this said but this is a high-end restaurant, where one goes to dine and anticipates good food, not just good service, and aesthetics but the combo of all.   I hate to say it, the food is not that good! I ordered the BRAISED OXTAIL LUMACONI, while I love oxtail, this dish was a big miss. For starters, the entire dish was cold, yes cold, the oaxtail itself was at normal temperature, the pasta was either cold or slightly warm, super strange. The portions are small, and I get it when you have higher-end restaurants providing high quality items, that is not the entire complaint here. My wine which was the red zin, which was also cold... as if it was refrigerated. We made mention of all of this to the manager when he came and asked how we were doing, and he was very apologetic and offered to pay for our meal the next time we returned. I am not in a rush to return so I had asked that he hep me get access to the rooftop bar which is a ton of fun! A must actually."}
{"text":"Great ambient and looks fancy. The food is way too complex. Italian it is not complex. Italian cusine does not put garlic on everything. Here you will order a garlic margheritta pizza. Service is pretty slow and my son butter pasta was soaked in butter. We will not return. There are true better Italian places in uptown and Dilworth."}
{"text":"We finally came to dinner at Angeline's. we really liked both dishes that we ordered  -oxtail pasta - yum yum! The oxtail was seasoned very well and had a distinct flavor. The pasta was a wee bit over cooked. But overall good  -branzino - excellent. You could really taste the wood smoked flavor.  -Brussels sprouts - nice and glazed.   -coffee was a nice night cap.   Overall 4 stars"}
{"text":"Gonna have to go ahead and underscore what others are saying about the salad. Tiny portion ($12 lunch salad I believe it was before any protein). Measly boring couple of salad leaves and not much else. Worse, the chicken breast I did get was puny, like a young child's portion tiny. My colleague's ordered the same thing but got obviously more chicken, like almost double (still, like a 10 year old's portion). Also the lunch menu is limited unless you like carbs a lot (pasta, pizza, sandwiches). Barely a few salads with no listed protein (had to ask for chicken).  Service was not great either. Waiter acted like my work colleague was out of line asking for bread at lunch. Won't be coming back. Cool decor though."}
{"text":"Very average food for a great environment. Waiter was good and the wine was well priced with good selection. I was just surprised the food was average. Had the fish but so disappointed with the flavor and presentation - ok with bone/head on in but not enough meat to pull off the bones. Caesar salad was very average without depth of flavor. Wife had the chicken and it was good but not great.  Maybe just drinks next time and go eat somewhere else. Lack of locally roasted coffee for espresso martinis is always a sign of average."}
{"text":"OMG this might have been the greatest foodie experience of my life! We sat at the bar and our masterful bartender Marshall whipped up amazing original drinks left and right based on people's tastes and preferences! If you like rose wine, ask for one on crushed ice with port! If you like gin, ask for a muddled cucumber gimlet or a modified \"power of love\" egg white special with gin instead of bourbon. For food... I had a split half and half order of the pumpkin angnolotti and the capesante seared scallops. It came with two of each, large in size, big enough to share with my husband and it was the greatest!!! The freshness of the oil and the pasta was unequaled. Greatest meal I've had in ages! I will be back again and again! Thank you and grazzia!"}
{"text":"Eh. It's new so they still may be working out the kinks. Caesar salad was not good at all and the eggplant parm was underwhelming. Clams and spaghetti was too garlicky and some of the clams were way too fishy and not purged properly. The vibe is so cool though that I hope they figure it out."}
{"text":"Sit down and let us tell you a story about the best lil' bowl of Bolognese in uptown.  Angeline's is now open for lunch and they have some really good options but the pappardelle with bolognese and crispy guanciale is the best thing on the menu.  Close second is the whipped Ricotta appetizer.  The inside space is beautiful and we can't wait to try out the patio when it gets warmer.  Definitely a good spot for a business lunch in uptown!"}
{"text":"Issa no for me, dawg.  This restaurant is located in an hotel. They have their own private entrance, but we entered through the hotel entrance.  The place was packed, but my party of two was seated fairly quickly.  Our waitress was great! She gave a lot of suggestions and it was hard for me to choose my order.   I decided on the oxtail pasta, because why not? Y'all I was so excited for this pasta! Oxtails + carbs is a guaranteed winner. Right?! Nope. I'm really sensitive to salt and this meal was so bland. NO FLAVOR WHATSOEVER. My taste buds were so confused.  If I come back to this place, it will be for drinks only."}
{"text":"I have to say Aiesha is amazing! This girl makes your evening magical!  She takes a fun planned evening and makes sure all aspects are taken care of so you have the best possible experience. If you haven't gone you MUST go and experience the deliciousness that is Angeline's. Ask for Aiesha!"}
{"text":"They have some major kinks to work out... food was ok but pasta dishes were all over cooked yet barely warm almost cool.. makes you wonder about the prep. Salads and apps were good. Oh, The wine selection... many Italian wines but layout of the menu is difficult to select as price points are all mixed in. We asked for help selecting wine, our waitress said she wasn't sure so another server came over and offered a glass to try that he was sure we would love. It was terrible.. the waitress then said they had a wine steward who would help us. 5 minutes later she came back and said quote \"he doesn't have time for you right now\"... in amazement we asked what that meant, she said \"he's really busy and said just order something California that you're used to.\"  Upon picking my jaw up off the floor we said we would be glad to wait for him. We did and he was nice enough but clearly not well educated in listening to patrons requests. We found a fine bottle after talking with him and basically picking it out ourselves and it was ok in the end but never should have taken 30 minutes to get to that point.  The Waitress was pretty much useless, couldn't hear her, she rarely checked on us and seemed to care less about what she was doing. With so many other places that that have good service and similar food, they need to get it together. They have just opened recently so will maybe chalk all of this up to timing but I'm not spending my next night out there...."}
{"text":"Just had our Xmas meal at Angeline's. Everything was FABULOUS. Sam & Kevin took great care of us. Sam was very attentive. Kevin took time to beautifully explain our meal to us. The bread came with a olive spread that started us out on a great high note. We had Fried Brussels Sprouts as an appetizer. I know many don't like Brussels Sprouts but we do and these had a super tasty balsamic vinegar dressing on it. Hubby had 1/2 chicken, I had the pappardelle bolognese, both dishes were some of the finest we've ever had. We finished with the Chocolate Ganache cake. Our bellies were very  satisfied as we waddled out of there."}
{"text":"Went to dinner here last Friday night with my uncle and his wife for her birthday. The food was not what I expected the chef could of put a lot of more effort into the dish. The flavors were not authentic I was a little disappointed, but my aunt enjoyed the birthday card and dessert."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and ambiance. Higher end Italian restaurant. Met an old friend for dinner and service was great and the chef even visited the table to make sure we enjoyed our meal."}
{"text":"Just had an awesome experience at Angeline's.  Our experience started with a fantastic host, Aiesha, who greeted us as if we were family.  She was pleasant, kind and professional.  Next, our waiter, Tyler, was awesome. He took great care of us, ensuring that our every need was met.  His patience was really appreciated as there were so many fantastic options on the menu that we had trouble deciding.  Adrienne, the manager, stopped by to make sure that everything was going well and helped us to decide.  The food, and we ordered a lot of it, was amazing.  There's everything to love here.  We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner Saturday night with 4 friends. The restaurant is beautifully designed and I would have loved to have had drinks at the bar if I hadn't been up on the rooftop. The food was well prepared and the wine list had a nice selection at good prices.  Loved my bolognese pasta dish and the zeppoles were delicious. Had a slight problem with getting our checks sorted out, but I am sure that will be corrected with a little more experience under the server's belt. Plan on returning in two weeks."}
{"text":"Had a great meal at Angelines! Everything from the food to the service to the atmosphere was perfect! The atmosphere is warm and they really paid attention to all of the details on the design.   Wine list is great, containing wines from all over the world and at all price points. Had a delicious Barbera, as well as some great cocktails!   Food was excellent, my favorites were the fried calamari, braised oxtail lumaconi and the brussel sprouts. The homemade pasta and sauce was incredible. Very rich dish so perfect for sharing! Ended the meal with the zeppoli, which are little Italian doughnuts. They were phenomenal and I especially loved the buttermilk ice cream they were served with. We also tried the carbonara pizza and the Queen's Chop Salad.   Casey was an excellent server. Took great care of us and was very friendly. The manager came over a couple of times as well and we enjoyed chatting with her.   Can't wait to go back for dinner again as well as try their brunch!"}
{"text":"Very good business lunch spot uptown. High level of service is evident from when you arrive. Two of us had flatbreads and one a salad. Quality dishes and not overly heavy flatbreads. Service was attentive but were good at not interrupting the business conversation. Recommend for entertaining clients."}
{"text":"Great service Taylor was exceptional.  Atmosphere was fantastic great location. Was opened for two days so far. Great managers service was spot on !"}
{"text":"Great company. Nice waitstaff. Ricotta appetizer was the highlight, and the olive tapenade was wonderful. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My husband took me to dinner here for my birthday! For a restaurant that opened on November 1st, they were very crowded. However, since we had a reservation we did not have to wait.  Our server was very knowledgeable & attentive. We had the Whipped Ricotta as an appetizer. It was flavorful &  light without being filling. I had the Bistecca which is the 21 day aged ribeye. It was well seasoned & very tender.  The ambience was very upscale & modern. However, a little too noisy to be deemed romantic. I would definitely characterize this as a special occasion restaurant or one to take friends!"}
{"text":"Was able to check this place out last week when I was here for their soft opening.  The lighting is dim and the atmosphere comes off as intimate.  This place would be awesome for a date night or a small group happy hour.  I didn't have a chance to try the food but it all looked delicious so I'll definitely be coming back soon. As soon as you walk in you'll see a HUGE wine collection, so if you're a wine snob like myself...you'll fall in love with this place!  Service was fairly slow but I'll chalk that up to them being new.  I look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"I had dinner at Angeline's with friends on a Friday evening around 9 pm. We sat outside on their beautiful patio which was expertly decorated and dimly lit - the ambiance was great.   We asked what the waiter recommended and we then ordered several items to share based on those recommendations; the items were brought out at different times. The first item we were delivered was the calamari which I'd give a 2 - it lacked flavor and all you really tasted was the fried taste. Then came the melon and prosciutto which I'd give a 2 - for over $10 there was nothing to this dish, literally just 5 slices of prosciutto and a few chunks of melon. Next up were the Brussel sprouts which I'd give a 2 - these had 0 flavor and really it was just the shavings of Brussels sprouts rather than the actual sprouts themselves. We had a mashed potato pizza with sausage which I'd give a 2 - kind of a weird combo and certainly not worth $16.  Then we had the mussels which I'd give a 4- they were huge, full of labor, and awesome to share. Only downside is they were served without bread, and after we finished the mussels there was tons of broth in the bowl we wanted to try so we asked for a couple slices of bread which they later charged us $4 for. We also had the oxtail pasta which I'd give a 4 - it was flavorful and delicious, but there was not nearly enough meat to justify the $26 price tag.  Overall the ambiance was great, service was fine, food was really subpar. For a meal over $100 I would expect much more, especially when we ordered what the waiter recommended as the best items on the menu."}
{"text":"Horrible hostesses and service. Walked in (we used to be regulars before tonight) - was told 5 min wait as they cleaned and finished of a table.  5 min later was told 25 min wait because of an Open Tavel reservation just came in.  Not OK to be pushed aside. Both girls horrible attitude and service.  Menu was getting old anyways. Many other options - looking forward to Haymaker opening up next week."}
{"text":"Never got a chance to experience the food because of their poor reservation system. Apparently hostess are not able to make reservations for parties of more than 6. I called on Tuesday hoping to make a reservation for that Friday night. The hostess took down my information and said the appropriate manager would call and confirm with me. As of 8:00 am on Friday morning, I never received a confirmation call. I followed up myself the previous Thursday night and the hostess was of no help. I called on my own again Friday morning at 7:30. The hostess said she could make my reservation for me (weird how the rules just changed) but I needed to push my time back. However 10 minutes later she called and said my reservation would be canceled.   Now it's my birthday weekend, and I'm stuck finding somewhere who can hold a large party the day of!"}
{"text":"An average rating based on my two visits here in the last couple weeks. We came here for dinner one evening, and thought the service was wonderful, the drinks were good, and the food was average. so we returned with some friends, and this time sat at the bar. We ordered some drinks and pizzas. the drinks were drinkable, and the pizzas had us questioning how one could screw up a pizza? To top it, the below average service from the bartenders had me convinced that that would be my last visit to the restaurant. if you find yourself there, I hope it's on a good food and good service kinda day. As for me, i'm going to have to redeem myself by choosing a better Saturday night venue next time!"}
{"text":"Wow!  What an amazing night.  We arrived on a Saturday night with no reservation.  A group of four, highly motivated, young guys looking for drinks and things.... and we were seated at a table of our choice within 5 minutes.  The outside patio area is fantastic.  They added a wood grain detail to the poured concrete retaining wall that blocks the city bustle from the dining experience.  Music plays from green outdoor speakers which kind of look like giant ant bait traps, but the sound quality and selection are perfect.  We were able to talk and enjoy the music without yelling over it.    The food was so tasty.  I had a salad and some pasta, and both were a tad on the small side, but highly flavorful.  I asked the hostess about my salad not having blue cheese crumbles on it as advertised, and she quickly made it right. I wasn't looking for a redo or a refund, but she made sure I left happy.  The pasta was SOOO GOOOD!!! I could have eaten three of the dishes full of  the al dente tagliatelle!!   Oh, how can I forget the drink?!  I had what was in essence a margarita, but a variation that was even better.  I believe it was called Cold Storage, YUM!!    The service was prompt and continuous.  Floors and tables were kept very clean, and the decorations were extremely tasteful and modern.  It was a great experience and I will certainly be back!!  Oh, the hostess gave me a flower when I was leaving because she said I made her night.  How sweet?!"}
{"text":"If you like your salt with some food on the side, then this is the place to go... had the clams and pasta, so salty I ended pouring my glass of water in it and added some lemon slices to it.  It made it better but I was not hungry by then.  My friend had some kind of chicken pasta,  same thing, just got very heavy handed with the salt. My other friend got the burger but she said it was just ok, not too impressed. Be prepared for fresh cut anchovies on your Caesar salads,  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Chose this place for my birthday after hearing about the new space through restaurant colleagues. Loved the aesthetic from the moment I walked in. Was promptly sat and greeted immediately. Eric was attentive and upbeat, and never missed a step even while training a new server.  He sent out the ricotta dish as a birthday gift. Awesome execution start to finish. The menu was balanced and easy to navigate. I highly recommend the mussels as well. Oxtail pasta for my main was a great choice. We passed on dessert in order to grab drinks upstairs. Great experience."}
{"text":"I also ended up with food poisoning the next day. This is an additional review from the previous one."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and felt like the bartenders were more worried about their beards than waiting on customers lol!  Just a weird situation and an overpriced menu to say the least.  Had the margherita pizza and I think the box weighed more than the pizza itself...  Good taste but wasn't impressed. Just not worth it based on all the other good Italian spots around town.  You guys have a lot of work to do if you wanna create a following."}
{"text":"My husband works in the building so we wanted to try it when they opened up. Hostess station has a lot to learn. I made a reservation a week ahead of time and when we were seated no one was in the restaurant so I asked for a booth and they said they were all taken. I then watched two of the booths sit empty while we ate our meal which took several hours. The service was slow for so few people to be in there as well. The portions left a lot to be desired for such a high price. The food was fair, I could have made better carbonara at home (and have).  You should visit Stagioni on Providence if you want good Italian food in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Great food / menu, attentive and knowledgeable wait staff, strong wine list and great space. One of the best in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Just terrible!  Bar service abysmal--and this was during a non-busy time. Slow, inattentive, lazy, sloppy.  Didn't offer water. Wine list by the glass dreadful--extremely limited. I was exhausted and decided to settle in and take a chance that the food was good. Bolognese tasted like someone dumped a whole bottle of Worcestershire sauce in it. Don't go here! Awful. Oh--and fruit flies at the bar."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere, and wait staff.  They were very knowledgeable and friendly.  The sommelier was very knowledgeable, too.  The menu was limited from an entree perspective.  The bolognese was fabulous -- pasta cooked perfectly.  Pizza, with sausage and hen of the woods mushrooms was delicious, too!  The whipped ricotta appetizer was really good. The pumpkin pasta did not have much flavor.  While I gave 3 stars due to limited entree menu,  I liked the atmosphere and the two entrees I mentioned.  I want to try the salads next time."}
