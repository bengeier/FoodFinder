{"text":"Had a reservation for 10 people on Easter. We we all there on time for our reservation  but like every time we go had to wait over 20 minutes for our table. This happened to us last time we were there. We were sat at this awkward booth that sat 6 of us on one side and 4 on the other. It took our waitress 30 min to create our cheese fondue spilling it onto the burner which made it burn and it was still milky on top. So she had to keep adding more cheese until it was finally right. Cheese still burning on the burner. Next course was fine. Then it took 30 more minutes after our main course for the chocolate course. By now our burner was completely covered in burned cheese and smelled bad. While we were waiting for our chocolate we scraped our burner to stop the smell. They never even noticed the burned crust and plopped the next pot right on top. What started out as something fun became a disaster. We talked to the management about the long wait times but he said that's the way it is. Our bill for 6 adults and 4 kids was over $350 which would be fine with great service and no burned cheese. Vowing never to go back."}
{"text":"Johnny was an excellent server. Had a great time. Food was fantastic. I would highly recommend  having dinner here! !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We were here 3 - yes I typed three - hours for a meal with two little kids.  Very long waits between the courses with no attention from server.  Of the three hours at least 60 full minutes was spent without any food in front of us.  But the best part, incorrect charges on the bill.  Wines prices upcharged on actual receipt to 1.5X the price listed on the menu.  I asked the manager on duty why there was a discrepancy and he went behind the bar, got some cash and gave it to me.  Now mind you, it was of course, no where near the amount I was overcharged but I guess it relieved his conscience.  He handed me the money and said \"It will take me too long to find out who your server was and look up the transaction, so here you go.\"  Unreal!  Food was average to below average and prices for what you get were a real rip off.  Original style broth that was recommended was so chock full of pepper you were downing water all night - if you could get a refill.  Save your money and time - go buy a fondue pot and do it at home.  You do all your own cooking here anyway so why not.  Will not return.  Hope this saves others a bad experience as well."}
{"text":"I've written complaints on here as well as sent the melting pot an email about my experience the night I dined here...and they have yet to reply to me or offer any sort of compensation! NEVER again."}
{"text":"Made a reservation a month in advance for 7, noting that it was an anniversary dinner (and hoping for one of the curtained off couples tables.) Called the night of and asked if we could change the reservation to 7:30 since we were running late.  We were informed that we could not and that we needed to make it within 15 min of our original reservation in order to be seated.  We rushed and made it right at the \"cutoff\" mark, and were seated at a huge table, I assumed because all the couples tables were full.  After getting settled in, we looked around only to find the restaurant dead empty.  We were one of maybe 5 parties there.  Why the rush?  Would have given only one star if not for the great food, and having plenty of leftovers for lunch the next day.  The server was quite attentive, so I think it's just the hostess desk that's not up to par.

Note; this will be a long meal so plan accordingly.  You can't do this place quick, its an experience."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. This was the second and final visit to this establishment and I will be sure to make sure everyone I know does not waste their time or money. For starters, the lights were so bright, we had to put the black cloth napkins over the light pendants. When have you ever been to dinner where the lights were too bright...seriously, they were painful even to my 82 year old father.  Then at 8:00pm when my dad asked for a coffee refill we were told they were out of coffee.  In Scottsdale, AZ they were out of coffee!!!. When I spoke to the Asst. manager Emily about this, she couldn't be more rude or more uninterested.  Where are we?  The food is average at best and  after 3.5 painful hours and a $400 dinner bill I was done. Time and money not well spent...do not make the same mistake we did!!"}
{"text":"What a scam.  Stay away from this place.  Tried to get reservations for 6:30 Saturday night, was told on 3:30 available.  So, we took the 3:30.  (4) of us for dinner.  We were actually there until 7:30(4 hours of slow, slow, slow service).  Restaurant half full.  

To make reservation, had to guarantee $35 cancellation fee per person. Only told after they took credit card information when booking reservation.  So, could not cancel.

Arrived on time, got seated on time.  Handed the menus and saw they had only a special Valentine's day menu.  $69.95 per person.  And a limited menu.  Okay, so if we cancel, we lose $140 (4 * $35) or we stay and take our chances.  Didn't find out until afterwards, but on their website, Special menu is listed under \"Specials and Events), click a couple more times and you find their Valentine's Day special.  Not on the main page of their website under Menus and not told when booking reservation.

So, rather than cause a scene, we stayed.  What a mistake.

Service was horrible.  Probably one of the worst in the valley.  Everytime the waitress came by, she had to interject herself into our conversation with her experiences on the subject we were talking about.  Who cares what she has to say.  Not to be rude, but if we wanted to talk to the waitress in depth, we would have invited her to dinner.

Then, she couldn't remember anything.  Had to remind her several times to bring the wine, the champagne.  And clumsy.  Nearly dropped a pot of hot melted cheese on my wife.  Missed, but got the floor.  Yummy.

The setup of the tables is equally bad.  Everytime the temperature on the stovetops had to be adjusted, you have to move your chairs so the waitress can reach under the table to adjust the setting.  Really.  Who thought that up.

And the food.  Basically overpriced boiled food.  Super salty.  Not much taste.  I get fondue, but something about boiled meat just seemed off.  

So, you order the appetizer(s), 2 to be shared.  4 people share (6) tiny pieces of bread.  A couple of pieces of salami, summer sausage.  Probably 50 cents worth of ingredients.  The melted cheese wasn't bad, but not great.

Then the salad.  Kidding me right.  Nope.  So small not even sure why they brought it out.  And basically some greens covered in average caesar dressing.  

Main course of a chicken potsticker, a couple pieces of raw chicken, a couple pieces of beef and some veggies.  The best part is \"boiling\" the meat and chicken in broth.  

The dessert was passable.  Hot chocolate fondue with the absolute smallest piece of banana you can imagine.  2 strawberries, a piece of carmel cheesecake, an ice cream dough thing.  I think I have seem the same at Costco for a couple of bucks for 100 of them.

But, you can have all of it for $140 per couple, plus tax, plus an automatic 20% tip.  Then the last joke of the evening, a place on the bill to put additional tip.  

Ranks amongst one of the worst dining experiences ever.  Bad service, mediocre food, way overpriced.

And to enjoy the experience even more.  The wife gets to spend a good portion of the following day on the throne (you know what I mean).  

Called today to tell the General Manager about the experience.  Could not talk to him and he was way to busy to talk to a customer(not any more).  So, told the assistant manager about the experience.  Basically called me a liar and that the experience from beginning to end could not be the way I described.  And then the best response every from a restaurant.  \"So, what do you want me to do about it\".

Absolutely nothing.  That's why we have Yelp.  Because Yelp listens.

Don't eat at this place.  Not worth the trip."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite chain restaurants - and I don't like chain restaurants.  This is a fun place for a date - it has the potential to be quite romantic (just be sure that the person you're bringing along is worth the time, effort, and money).  All cynicism aside, cooking your own morsels of food, though time consuming, is a great way to get to know your date.  They have an extensive wine list.  You'll be spending a lot of time with your server as they prepare cheeses and desserts tableside, so be chatty and be polite.  Try the Coq au Vin cooking style which gives you a nice pot of Burgundy wine and spices in which to cook your food.  This place is a great destination.  Be prepared for a big night on the town!"}
{"text":"Why is this place still in business? My husband and I have no problem dropping a couple hundred dollars on an excellent meal, but this just didn't cut it. It is outrageously overpriced for what you get. Our waiter wasn't very knowledgeable and the menu was confusing. Apparently there is a fundraiser menu, but it's the new menu, but you can order off the old menu, etc.  Plus, you have to cook everything yourself. I know that's part of the experience, but the reality is you probably don't know how to cook meat in broth or oil. It is either under or over cooked, there's no seasoning, and it takes forever to cook one bite at a time. If you order the oil (for a $7 surcharge!) they bring you batter to tempura your food. Every time my husband tried this it came out a slimey grey mess. If you're absolutely set on going here, save yourself the money and disappointment and just get the cheese and chocolate. If you want to have an awesome celebratory meal, steer clear of this place and go somewhere like Steak 44 instead. We can't stop talking about how disappointing the meal was, especially with $190 price tag!"}
{"text":"Yes, The Melting Pot is more than some people can afford but the experience it totally worth it! I have been begging the hubby to take me there for dinner and one night and he finally caved and took me, the service was excellent and the food was amazing! I definitely want to go back someday!"}
{"text":"Went to this place last night with my girlfriend for the first time. First walking in, the place had a low-key, romantic mood. The staff was very friendly and we were seated promptly. We were seated in a private booth that was accompanied with a curtain and dim lighting. Our waitress was very knowledgable and we found out it was her first night working the floor. She seemed like she had been working there a very long time. Bottom line for this review:
It's a date place for couples. There is a process for the four course meal which is time consuming so do not plan on a quick sit down to eat. You pay for the dining experience which is exciting and very sensual. The wine is great and the food is delicious. Book your reservation ahead of time as walk-ins cannot always be accommodated. I don't know how people can rate this place less than 5 stars. Even the price a bit steep but well worth the food, wine and experience with your loved one."}
{"text":"We go to this restaurant every birthday and celebration because of how fantastic it is.  It is a little pricey, but the food is amazing, the variety of things you get from the cheese to the chocolate are something we look forward to for months.  The variety of items in the entree and all of the different sauces make this so individualized. It takes a little longer than most meals because of cooking the food at the table and all of the courses, which makes for a great night of conversation and connecting.  This has been my favorite restaurant for years, and continues to be."}
{"text":"If you know what to expect in a fondue restaurant this is an excellent place. Much better service than the other locations in Az. Our server was friendly, nice and made the visit very pleasant. Ask for Mike D in your reservation comments section."}
{"text":"So we went in on a groupon and I just want to say I was impressed with such amazing service. So many places treat you different when you use a groupon. I just wanted to say that our waitress was outstanding serving with a smile and being extra attentive to our table. It was just my husband and I out for a Friday night date trying something new and this surpassed our expectation immensely! I cannot remember our server's name but she was truly great (: Also The manager is so genuine he was walking around talking with everyone including my husband and I. It was just such a great vibe and kicked off a great night for us!"}
{"text":"The dinning experience here was such fun and totally delightful and delicious.  Our server, John,  was very friendly, informative, and helpful in every way!  I would highly recommend this place to anyone.  Everyone here was very concerned as to whether all was going well and even the owner and manager checked on us.  All in all a very wonderful experience."}
{"text":"I decided on The Melting Point as my choice and phoned the restaurant to place the reservation. The guy taking the reservations could hardly be heard or understood. we could not get water on the table for a good 20-30 mins and had to ask the neighboring waiter. Piss poor service with mediocre food."}
{"text":"I always love going to The Melting Pot, especially for special occasions. Their servers are experienced and friendly and the food is always perfect. When I went to The Melting Pot the other day, however, it was interesting to see a balloon man walking around entertaining the kids. I had to ask myself if I was at Red Robin or a nice restaurant that I am paying a decent amount for. While trying to enjoy my dinner, I kept hearing \"Do you want a lion, a hat, or a sludge hammer?!\" This was a little disappointing and put a bad taste in my mouth. The next time I decide to go out for a special event and spend a good amount of money on a meal I might consider going somewhere else."}
{"text":"My 3rd time to Melting Pot and still loving it !!! 

It is all about the EXPERIENCE ... 
Went with a group of friends for birthday dinner and had their 4 course dinner and averaging an hour per course .... 
So do set aside plenty of time and tummy space to enjoy each of the course. The 4 course dinner will give you the full fondue experience but it is indeed a lot of food.  From the cheese fondue, salad, entree, dessert, everything is absolutely delicious and the dessert is totally out of the world. If nothing else, everyone should at least come try their chocolate fondue .... they have happy hour for a very good price
And if you are up for a early dinner or a very late dinner, they have special for $35 for 3 course meal. But I think they have some restriction on what day it is offered, so check ahead. 

Overall, wonderful experience, great services, awesome conversation spot, and fantastic food.

Finally got to try their happy hours .... it was as good as I could remember ... and for $5.00/person ... you cannot beat that .... the only thing is that they have only couple of spots .... so come in early to get your spot"}

We went here on are anniversary and I loved it they have it dark to set the mood it's  intimate  romantic. Yes it cost I pretty penny we ended up spending around 150 for the two of use that included some of the best drinks! The service is nice they try and leave you be like ninjas refilling your drink."}
{"text":"Great anniversary dinner. Justifiably recommended by our friends.  Lovely and decadent. We loved it"}
{"text":"Well tried to go out to dinner with my sister, nephew and son.  I had won a gift certificate before the new year for Peters in Scottsdale.  However hadn't had a chance to go. We went all the way out to McCormick Ranch and the place was closed down.   I checked on the net and nothing there said they were closed.  

We live in Peoria and were starving, so we decided to go to the Melting Pot since they opened at 3.   We had 45 minutes to wait before they opened so we decided to wait since we were already in the area.  There were only two parties there there besides when the doors opened. The hostess asked if we had reservations and we said no.  She said that was ok and said she was going to seat the other two parties first because they had reservations and then seat us.  That was ok.  We waited 10 minutes and the manager came out a couple minutes later and asked if we had reservations.  Again I said no.  He said well it would be 20-25 minutes wait.  They only had 2 servers and it wouldn't be fair to us they wanted to give us all the attention we deserved. I tried to explain we had already waited 45 min for them to open, we came all the way out from Peoria and the other restaurant was closed down.  The manager could care less.  He repeated they only had 2 servers. I said you have got to be kidding me and he looked at me like I had 4 heads.  I said this is ridiculous and walked out.  

I'm sorry but it must be nice to be able to afford 1 server per table (a party of 5 and a party of 4).  There was only two tables filled in the whole restaurant.   Pretty sad when a server can't handle more than one table at a time. The manager was a total jerk and needed to go back to school to be trained how to treat customers. 

I will never go there ever again.  I hope no one else does either.    The only reason I gave it one star is because you can't post without it. They deserve zero."}
{"text":"After two extremely disappointing trips to the Melting Pot in Ahwatukee, I was hesitant to try the Scottsdale location. I had some dip certificates that were about to expire, so I decided to give them another try. 

I am so glad that I did. Not only was the food amazing, but the service was excellent. Michael D. was the server, and he was friendly and professional. There were two managers walking around to make sure that everyone in the restaurant was satisfied, and I was very happy to honestly say that it was the best experience I've ever had at The Melting Pot in a long time. From now on, I'll only come to this location. If Michael is still there the next time I visit, I will definitely be asking for his section again."}
{"text":"I'll keep this short. The food is good, the ambience is good and the entire visit is an experience like any other. Go there with time on your hands, go there with people you have plenty to talk about with as it takes a while. This is a place to relax and enjoy being served and eating food which is so different. If the price seems prohibitive, go for the happy hours."}
{"text":"Staff was all very friendly. Food was good. Probably a little expensive based on the portions, but it's a unique experience. Pace of the meal gives you plenty of time to talk, so a good date place.

I checked in on YELp and was supposed to get a free box of chocolate covered strawberries, but they were out of them. A little surprising since our reservation was for 6 pm.  

Staff was good about it. Comped me the value of the strawberries, but should probably have more available at that time of night.

Overall, I'd recommend."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here on Feb 11th at 9:30pm hoping for chocolate fondue. We made reservations on Open Table. When we got there the hostess told us that they had \"tried\" to notify us but that they were only serving a special Valentines menu at $79/person. We already had dinner with friends earlier so we were just looking to finish the evening together with chocolate fondue. But they claimed there were no other menu options other than this \"special\" menu. I get that there could be special courses for Valentines Day. But they told us this only at the door, having driven 18 miles, at 9:30pm, and with no other choices! Classic bait and switch! 

If they had really wanted to get a hold of us, our reservation had both my phone number and email listed. Instead they tried to ambush us at the door with this special menu hoping we'd have no other option but to eat a second dinner at $79/person so we could also have our dessert. They bait and switched us hoping I'd avoid the embarrassment in front of my date and just accept their terms. But my date was my wonderful wife who agreed the whole thing was a sham and we didn't need to be insulted so we left and instead had a wonderful dessert at the Cheesecake Factory. So beware, they may not tell you up front if you make your reservation online but if you're going for Valentine's Day on the 14th this special menu is also in effect and is the only choice that evening. After this experience, we'll be choosing other places for dinner or dessert."}
{"text":"We went here for my birthday during Restaurant Week.  Made reservations a few days in advance - there was much confusion about the end date of restaurant week and informed them we'd be celebrating a birthday.  

We waited about 15 minutes past out reservation time to be seated. No mention of the birthday we had informed them about.  We informed our server that we'd never been there before or to a fondue restaurant and she just smiled and walked away.  We had to ask her repeatedly what to do as we were given no direction. We were very disappointed in the service.

The food was fine - we did add the coq au vin, which was a flavorful sauce of fresh herbs, mushrooms, garlic, spices and burgundy wine.  The desert was good as well (you can't go wrong with chocolate)!

The meal does take about 2 1/2 hours to complete and is a bit on the pricey side.  We are glad to have experienced it, but would not return."}
{"text":"This location is really hit or miss. We tried it a couple of times and once was ago and the other was AWFUL. I stated very clearly that I was allergic to mushrooms and they still brought them to the table. It was taken away but there was some kind of contamination because I was sick as a dog the rest of the weekend. Ruined our whole weekend and we will never be going back."}
{"text":"I save the Melting Pot for special occasions, and of course it would not disappoint you.  It's classy and the service is great."}
{"text":"Tonight we had the pleasure of dining at The Melting Pot in Scottsdale.  We had the spinach dip fondue, California salad, endless dinner, and chocolate fondue.

Our meal was AMAZING!

The manager, Emily, was so sweet and took a complimentary photo of us, as well as stopping by to check on us.

Our server, Jason, was attentive and helpful!

We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I just celebrated a belated Valentines dinner here last week and LOVED it.  It was his first experience and he wants to go back again.

Of course we cannot go every week or every month considering that it costs a pretty penny.

The service was awesome, the food came out quickly and everything was mouth-watering.  The drinks took a little long but I think it was because he also brought the cheese fondue at the same time, either that or the bartender was slow that night."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 10 stars, I would! We've been here a few times but last evening we took our girls there for a birthday dinner after swimming with dolphins down the road and they were chilled. We asked if they had any shirts we could buy. They didn't but they did have long-sleeved uniform shirts. Not for sale, though, but they just gave them to us so that my girls were comfortable! Don is an amazing server. So nice and the food is incredible. My only regret is that we were so \"drunk\" from the chocolate fondue that we forgot to take home our doggie bag! Love you guys!"}
{"text":"Interesting dinning experience I had at The Melting Pot in scottsdale tonight. We were greeted at the door and brought to our seat. The atmosphere is dark and quiet with soft music played in the background. We were then greet my our waiter and took our drink order. We have been to this Melting pot over a couple dozen of times but it has been sometime since we have been back and let me say this will be our last trip there. The waiter informative and attentive to our needs. The first course we had the Santa Fe cheese it was delightful with a beer base and salsa cheesy goodness. As we continued to our main course of Sirloin, chicken and potstickers everything was going great, until my daughter felt something crawling on her leg. Low and behold it was a roach that wanted to join us for dinner. The others in my party including my daughter freaked out and got up from the table, we went to find someone to help remove the roach which took a while which was strange. Once they removed the roach we all sat back down and I looked under the table again and sure enough there was another roach. This time the Manager came over to collect the roach, the strange thing was her never apologized he just calmly said \"oh geez, well thats Arizona for you\" he then proceeded to leave the table. Needless to say we all lost our appetite, so we pretty much wasted a couple pounds of meat. I didn't want to continue with the desert but since it was my daughters birthday we decided she would be sad if we didn't get a birthday desert. While we were waiting for our desert the Manager came over again and asked us how the food was and strike up some small talk, never apologizing for the roach that decided to crash our dinner. The desert came we chose the Yin and Yang, it was white chocolate and dark chocolate swirl. The dippers were good but like i said earlier everyones appetite got ruined from the previous course. Heres the thing I expected some type of apology or even them comping our desert, instead we paid for the bill and left. I will never be going back to the Melting pot the food is mediocre at best and the atmosphere is strongly uncomfortable. Our waiter was good but Im surprised that the Manager was so strange about the whole roach issue."}
{"text":"I saw a someone praise this place on Facebook and I started chuckling. My wife asked me to go with her to the melting pot a couple years ago. She was very excited until the food actually came. That's when she said, this isn't what we ordered. I said yeah there is less then 4 oz of meat to share between 2 people. She said, no I meant these are the wrong sauces. I said hang on. We are paying 120 dollars for 2 cups of raw vegetables, 4 oz of meat, and beef stock? She said well your paying for the ambiance. Plus desert is to die for. Desert came, she said Isn't this great and I said we are dipping less then a cup of fruit in chocolate. At the end she said you hated it, didn't you. I said baby I loved being there with you, but I have never paid so much money in all my life to eat every day food and stay hungry. For the same money we could have gone to any number of nice restaurants and actually had a full meal.  My wife laughed and then said yeah your right. It's a great little niche restaurant idea, but once you get past all the hoopla this is place is a huge rip off.  On the plus side, It's a nice romantic place with super dark tables. Cooking your own food gives you plenty of time to sit and talk with that special someone."}
{"text":"My daughter was in a group of 17 kids going to dinner for prom.  Although she said the food was good; the service was not.  They had a 6:30 reservation and did not get out of the Melting Pot until after 9:30; which means they did not arrive at prom until 10:15.  They missed the whole prom basically.  Not happy to spend that much and they know they have a dance to get to and they take that long.  Kids were disappointed!"}
{"text":"A very unique place specializing fondues.. This is my first try, everything went like I expected, but not outreaching... We had the Fusion version of the Big Night Out  four-course meal.. A lot of food for two, and not cheap!

1st course - Fondue A La France
It was a-ok.. the cheese mix was great, but the white wine (don't remember name) base was too strong... I wish they'd use less of the alcohol. But you get unlimited sides with it..

2nd course - Salad Nicoise and California Salad
Both salads were tasty! However, the plates arrived in an ice-cold condition, and by looking at the presentation of the salad, I felt it was already pre-made and came out from the refrigerator.. the leaves just don't look like were just mixed together...

3rd course - Main entree with Court Bouillon cooking style
The fusion version offers one extra item, a lobster tail, other than that, everything is the same from the feast version. Meat and seafood were fresh, wish that I had chosen a different cooking style, maybe the Bourguignonne, didn't really enjoy the vegetable broth, personally think the taste was too strong..

4th course - White & Dark Chocolate Fondue
This was my fav!!! The mixture of two kinds of chocolate was just right, adding the different toppings for dipping, cheesecake, strawberries, bananas...hmmmm... If only it has less calories, I'll never have enough!

The whole dinner took about 2 hours as we're fast-eater and didn't really spend that much time on the cheese fondue...so come prepare for a long stay if you want to experience the 'whole package'.."}
{"text":"This was an amazing experience. It cost more than anticipated and the waiter might have been having a bad day, but would highly recommend."}
{"text":"If you go here, you will enjoy a four course fondue meal. The desert chocolate is awesome. I prefer the 'Smores' option but the others look great also. They have many options for the main course. This place is pricey and you do have to cook your own food, but a nice option for special occasions."}
{"text":"Best fondue experience, hands down. I've always loved fondue, but until going here, I never knew it could be so delectable. The seating is very private and intimate, and the mood lighting really adds elegance. As for the food - delicious and satisfying. Also, our server was uncannily timely. He always knew when to serve the next course, haha. I wish I could remember the name of him - he was an excellent server

The only thing I dislike is the price. It is, quite frankly, outrageous. Especially, since you're basically cooking it yourself. My friends and I only go here on VERY special occasions - because the check was an occasion itself.

But above all, wonderful food, wonderful servers and hosts, wonderful atmosphere."}
{"text":"It is always a treat when we go out to eat as a family. We just had desserts but SO MUCH FUN!  It is a great environment and impeccable service!"}
{"text":"Came with my fiance (his first experience) and we both absolutely loved it. Very friendly staff from the host, to server, to manager. I was taking a selfie and a worker walking by (not our waiter) offered to take the picture for us. Service was great, food was beyond amazing and all around ended our anniversary perfectly."}
{"text":"I went to the melting pot for the first time for valentine's day with my boyfriend.  It was delicious!  Our server was incredible.  She was very attentive to our needs and made us feel like we were her only guests that night.  I noticed the manager going to every table and thanking them for choosing the restaurant.  Talk about personalized service!  They have these special enclosed booths that have a curtain.  It is defintely a romantic spot.  You have to have the artichoke dip.  It was the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Mary was our server and she was great. The cheese fondue was great and we loved the cool dippers! We appreciated the manager Tony stopping our table too. 
When Mary brought out the chocolate and the plate said Happy Anniversary-well that was super cool! Thanks Mary for a great night as we celebrated our 30th anniversary! We will be back soon."}
{"text":"I am SHOCKED to see any negative reviews here. Our experience was amazing! We visited last night for our 7th wedding anniversary. We had previously visited the location in Santa Barbara, CA for our 2nd anniversary and Columbia, MD for our 5th. We are no strangers to TMP but this was our first visit to an Arizona location. It did not disappoint, in fact, my husband and I agreed it was our favorite visit to any TMP yet. 

Our server Kayla was wonderful. Polite and friendly, she also had perfect timing and went above and beyond to make sure we had a great experience. The food was delicious, as always. I'm not going to go into too much into detail on that because you can check out the other reviews for an in-depth food description or the company website. We also enjoyed a couple delicious cocktails and AZ craft beers which my husband loved. 

Is it expensive? Sure, but it's well worth the splurge! Look, maybe it's not some people's cup of tea. Some people would rather just go to a boring steakhouse. We go for the EXPERIENCE and the Scottsdale location delivered. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"What I love about the Melting Pot is the whole evening is centered on making a meal and sharing the experience with family and friends. It's a wonderful culinary experience that keeps drawing me back!!"}
{"text":"We have a great time, everything was delicious, the dessert awesome! We had a great service by Mike. Thanks for help us have a wonderful night"}
{"text":"We went to this place just so the kids could have some fun desert. I had been there a couple times before my kids were born (about 10+ years ago) and i thought we had a good experience, but things have changed now - for the worse. Place seems to be frequented by the rich old scottsdale clientele that arrive in their mercedes's and don't mind throwing 100bucks on what i would say is - mediocre food - and whats with being attended by snobbish waiters. We had one that barely showed up for taking the order, we could not get water on the table for a good 20 mins and had to ask the neighboring waiter - who also seemed to forget us - only when we called another waiter across the table did we get some water. The way it works is - you get a bunch of fruits and cookies and other dippers that you can dip in a bowl of molten chocolate. When the waiter showed up - he reminded us that if everyone on the table had a plate, we would have to pay 9$ each. I am not sure why he said that - as if we would not be able to afford it or something. I know the desert is overpriced  - but i m there with my family to have a good time. Take the order and bring back some food - and should not be too hard to smile when you do that. Anyways, he took the order and disappeared. Showed up after a while and had two plates - i was like - i just ordered food for all on the table - why skimp? i did not make a fuss - we still made sure the kids enjoyed and i still paid him the 20% gratuity- which he did not deserve. Piss poor service with mediocre food. Sad. I don't generally give out reviews, let alone bad ones, but i was not happy here."}
{"text":"Every time I've gone to this location, the folks are very sweet and attentive. Food is always consistent."}
{"text":"My husband and I like to go Melting Pot to have dinner always. Everything was great so far. However, we were extremely disappointed with the food that they served yesterday.Yesterday we chose the special offer - Endless fondue. $36.95 per person. 

The filet mignon was not fresh at all and it has strange smell. I guess this was the worst filet mignon that i ever had in my life! The teriyaki marinated sirloin and prawns were great at first. However, when we asked to refill the teriyaki marinated sirloin and prawns, you can tell that those quality of the refillable sirloin and prawns dropped significantly. I guess those refillable food are cheap/sales stuff. I actually have the pictures with me. 

We have spent $111 yesterday but was extremely disappointed with the food quality. I was thinking to give feedback at their website but I couldn't as I have forgotten to take the receipt with me and we need to fill in the receipt number in order to give feedback to the Melting Pot website.  I will never tried their ENDLESS FONDUE again as I do not want to eat those lousy food. I like to go to the Melting Pot BUT i think i will STOP going as i cant believe that they served bad quality food to their customer at the moment. I was thinking to tell my friends to try this ENDLESS FONDUE at first. However, I would tell all my friends NOT to try their ENDLESS FONDUE now. 

I Hope that the Melting Pot will take note of this issue and please don't serve your customer with2nd/3rd grade food when your customers are willing to pay. I do not know the reason behind why you served bad quality food... Is that because of the price is cheaper or because of the business is not that good during this summer and you have tons of food in your freezer which are not fresh?"}
{"text":"I don't normally write Yelp reviews, but my experience at this resturant was so bad that I feel I must share it to warn others as to what to expect.  
My sorry experience was as member of group that had the misfortune to chose this place to celebrate an event.   There were seven of us and we were enjoying our selves laughing and having a good time.  Apparently this doesn't fit with the business model of this restaurant.   As a result we got into an argument with the manager and walked out on 300 dollar tab. 
This restaurant is pretentious and overpriced. Avoid this place, there are a lot better restaurants out there."}
{"text":"The entire experience was great until a cocky waiter decided to keep all my change and take a well over 20% tip. The manger didn't seem to really care and once the issue was brought up he took 10 minutes just to come back with my change. The waiter (josh) was attentive until he took the tip then he made sure not to make eye contact."}
{"text":"I used to love the Melting Pot years back, but when I tried it again more recently, I couldn't remember for the life of me why.

The reason for my 2 stars is for the poor food quality. The only thing saving my review from one star is the comparable atmosphere and the concept. The concept is really fun, I mean, who doesn't like fondu? The cheese dip was just mediocre at best and tasted like something I could make at home by just melting down some cheddar cheese. The salad was nothing special and the meat/seafood wasn't a good quality. My biggest disappointment was the filet as it was super tough and fatty. Unfortunately, I expect more for the prices and my experience there left much to be desired."}
{"text":"As a 44 year old college educated female I must admit I mad a very poor decision in my restaurant selection . Very disappointed in our dinner tonight. I have waited over 20 years to do this dining experience and should have waited 20 more years. Went for our  21st anniversary tonight and was shocked to know that you get a boiled dinner for $50 per person with lack luster flavor.  They provide all types of sauces and herb butter etc to add as your seasoning and garlic salt mix seasoning however they did nothing for flavor.


Not a fun and interactive experience at all. 
I had done my research and looked at their website online and read reviews and thought this was going to be a nice dinner. To me cooking your dinner is not
boiling filet mignon, chicken and shrimp in broth. That's just wrong! 
For vegetables, celery, carrots, broccoli and bread quite surprised
on the choice of cheap vegetables to accompany the cheese.  Then only white  button mushrooms,boiled red potatoes and more broccoli for steaming in broth as our vegetables with entree. Just very sad. 

I have eaten at many restaurants and this is the first review I have ever
written to warn others. There are many places to  enjoy a dining 
experience that is romantic other than this. I have no problem paying 
for a meal if it is worth it and this wasn't worth it.  Now I see why 
people frequent this with Groupon offers and don't pay full price. 

Truly the only food that should be boiled is a crab boil. During the 3 hour meal.. The highlight of our dinner was when we both visited the restroom and to each of 
our surprise we said the best part of the experience was the nice
cloth towels to dry your hands.  My husband agreed ... and read my mind
I guess after 21 years of marriage I am lucky he knows me so well.

We marked this off our bucket list tonight and he even came home to tell
the kids it was BAD and he has never done that !   I told my husband we should have gone to IN and Out for this  evening's dinner and would have had more fun.

You always have a choice please chose to go somewhere else and not
make the mistake we did."}
{"text":"For a quiet and slow dinner, go here. The atmosphere is really laid back, the price is a little high but the fun behind going out for fondue helps. It has been a long time since I have been here, it might be time for a revisit to see what I think of it now."}
{"text":"We used to be fans and just living close sometimes just having cheese and dessert at the bar. Most bartenders are fun and appreciate the little extra fun we provide as well as being decent tippers. 
Got here today to an empty bar and looked around - relatively empty dinning room and were told only chocolate at the bar. No you can't have a table and we won't feed you at the bar. Even the new bartender was cavalier about it. 
When June rolls around and you are begging for locals, count us out. What would it hurt to feed us a cheese pot."}
{"text":"First time at the Melting Pot. My wife and I celebrated our anniversary. Romantic setting. Food was great. Servive was great. Even the manager, John, stopped by our table. Impressive. We will go back."}
{"text":"Went here with a group & had a fun, yummy, first time experience!

First of all, the bartender was great!  He made the perfect lemon drop & margarita! *yum!*

The staff was very friendly & told us what do expect & what to do.

Loved the choice of waters that we had on the table.

The interaction (cooking) was fun and something different.  From dipping veggies into different pots of hot cheese mixes, to cooking meats & shrimp shabu shabu style, to dipping fruits & desserts into different chocolate mixes (our fave!!)

I would come back for the dessert part, for sure! Oh and the drinks!!

Over all, a great time and some yummy food."}
{"text":"Dear Reviewers reading,
I been to the Melting Pot in Houston so I thought this one will be good here, I mean its located in a beautiful expensive town but the service here wasn't all that amazing. my group and I got the endless fondue special going on, the food was amazing nothing wrong there it was our waitress although she was so nice to us she was slow. I ran out of my drink in the beginning and she even came a couple times to change out things and didn't notice my glass was empty sitting there. I didn't want to beg or be rude and tell her \"Hey my glass is empty\" so I waited to see how long she noticed, which after coming a total of 2 times she finally noticed it and got me a refill. Then the time after that she noticed and said she would be back with a refill when she came back she forgot it, until the manager was making his rounds and saw my cup empty and asked what was I drinking? I was surprised he noticed right when he walked up but not her. I guess trying to watch 3 people was a little too much for her. I didn't get rude or tell no one I wanted her to do her job that's all. Other than that problem everything was amazing."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here last night, and I gotta say it was disappointing.
We went for the 4 course meal which was incredibly average, especially for the price! 
Our server was slooooowwwww and not attentive at all, they kind of stick you in this corner booth then forget about you! Wouldn't go back, spent $100+tip on a meal with tiny portions and crappy service."}
{"text":"This was our first experience at the melting pot.  It was an awesome experience.  Anthony was our server and he did such an awesome job and provided great service.  We will come back soon"}
{"text":"This was the second visit to the Melting Pot thinking that the food and service would be better the second time. Wrong! The service was terribly slow with the drink order alone having taken 25 minutes. The food is grossly overpriced and the quantities extremely small not to mention that some of the vegetables not being fresh. Their deserts are interesting however, should not be the reason to be a destination eatery. We will not return as price vs value and quality does not exist. And it seems they really do not care."}
{"text":"We just finished our meal here and it was amazing. Our waiter Logan was super nice and was very helpful when we wanted to order something. The food was great. Loved how we had or own small space to cook our food. Overall the whole restaurant was great would recommend."}
{"text":"We celebrated our 21st anniversary here last night.
It was pretty pricey for the quality of food we received.
We ordered the ahi entree and the vegetarian entree.
It is obvious the restaurant is geared more towards meat and shellfish entrees.
Our server was attentive and the chocolate turtle fondue with accompaniments was our favorite part of the meal"}
{"text":"While it is a little pricey - it is a great place for a slow date or lots of conversation."}
{"text":"Everything was very good...no complaints from us! I only took a star off bc our server took a while to clear our dinner plates. I came here with my bf bc we were celebrating our anniversary :) 
We started with the cheddar cheese fondue...seriously yum!! 2nd course was teriyaki sirloin, chicken, pork and filet. We choose the Mojo broth and it was very good.    Dessert was the milk chocolate fondue and the extra decadent plate thing (cheese cake, cream puffs, etc...seriously get it....you won't be sorry!) 
We'll def be back!!!"}
{"text":"Love it, I go every year for my Birthday...great service by Emily and hostess was quick to seat us, manager came by table to greet us...love the cheese fondue !! And chocolate !!"}
{"text":"ok so, first of all, if i had known we had to cook our own food i never would have gone here. second of all, the cheese was good but not $16 good. the food was ok, but if you get something different from your date you still share the same pot so the flavors get all muddled. plus, the lighting is very dim in this restaurant so it was very hard for me to tell if my pork, chicken, shrimp and any other must be fully cooked foods were fully cooked. i must say, their curry sauce was amazing, and so were the chocolate covered strawberries, which is why i'm giving 2 stars instead of 1. i will not be back to throw away close to $100. i can go to ruth's chris and have an amazing meal for that price. i'm very disappointed."}
{"text":"The company I work for booked The Melting Pot for our holiday party this year, and we all had a great time. I am rating it 3 stars because although I didn't have to pay, I think the value may be questionable for what you get.

First off, the staff was amazing. Having never had fondue in a restaurant setting before, they were quick to explain each and every thing on the table. They were quick with all requests, and they kept the wine flowing and the tables cleared off. Their attitudes were superb for the affluent area the place is in.

The first course was an introduction, with a blend of melted cheeses bubbling away on our table with an assortment of breads, vegetables, chips and even granny smith apples to dip in and sample. This was probably my favorite part of the meal. Next came a salad, which I enjoyed, but found it unremarkable. The main course consisted of a sampling of various meats and seafood: chunks of steak, seasoned beef, seasoned chicken, mini-stuffed pasta medallions, prawns, and a lobster tail. This was partnered with various veggies including mushrooms, potatoes and broccoli, and a variety of dipping sauces, with of course the hot broth to cook everything in. My favorite part of this course was the seafood dipped in the herb butter, and the gorgonzola dip. Last was (naturally) the famous dessert course, with chunks of brownie, cheesecake and fruit with pots of milk and white chocolate to coat it all with (the cheesecake and marshmallows was the highlight). 

While I did think everything was OK, I didn't think it was something I could have gone the rest of my life without trying. I could see this place as impressive for a date or significant anniversary or event, but there are far better \"fancy\" restaurants with more flavorful offerings. Even though we were in a large group, my wife and I got a table to ourselves, and that \"date night\" feeling really works well with this place. Another good aspect was that we got our pick of everything presented while everyone else had to share. 

One of my favorite things to eat is shabu shabu, and while similar in execution, I think the Japanese version of cooking-your-own-food is far superior. I'd gladly pay the premium for shabu shabu, but The Melting Pot just isn't my thing."}
{"text":"Service was awful! The greeting from the manager is \"Can I help you?\"...ummm, I'm here to eat something (stopped in for happy hour). When they run advertised specials the staff is completely uneducated about the details. 
When I was younger this was a place for special occasions, but the patrons at this location looked like they we hanging at a drive thru. 
The overall quality has really gone down, I think my relationship with Melting Pot is officially over."}
{"text":"The Melting Pot is an interesting and unique place for a meal, but certainly is outrageously overpriced, otherwise I would give it an even higher rating.

The cheese fondue really is out of this world. And the desserts are also nothing short of amazing. I wasn't too impressed with the main course however and that part of the meal especially does little to justify the price.

The service here is quite good and the waiters could probably even afford to give you more alone time than they do. This is a place I would definitely return to for a special occasion, because it is a nice experience despite the price."}
{"text":"My BF decided to surprise me with The Melting Pot experience for our anniversary..I've always wanted to try it and have heard great things from friends.  The Melting Pot definitely did not disappoint! Our fondue aficionado, Kayla, was genuinely nice and made this special night one to remember.  We had the spinach & artichoke cheese to start...Yum!!! Especially on granny smith apples and the pumpernickel bread pieces. The California salad was pretty good, the dressing was REALLY good and the meat and veggie portions in round 3 were perfect. It doesn't LOOK like a lot of food, but trust me when I say your tummy knows the difference! Perfect portions. Last but not least...DESSERT! We had the turtle chocolate...O.M.G. it was heaven on a strawberry, rice krispie treat, pound cake and especially the brownie! The price wasn't too shabby as we did a special for about $40 per person, but heck you're paying for the ambient experience.  Thanks Kayla for making our anniversary one to remember.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Last night I went to The Melting Pot with three girlfriends for a special \"Girls' Night Out\" event that they marketed. There was a set menu, and the price was $29 per person with a few options for $5 martinis. If you wanted a drink that wasn't on the set menu, you paid extra. 

When we arrived, we were greeted outside by two very bronzed girls who were promoting Planet Beach tanning salon. They gave us as many samples as we could carry (for those of us who wanted tanning lotions and such) and had a entry form for a free month of tanning.

We had reservations for 6:15, so we were seated promptly. Our waiter, Cody, came over to introduce himself and explain how things were working that evening. When we asked about the other activities outside (we had seen girls getting paraffin dips and hand massages and eyebrow waxing in the courtyard), Cody told us that we could participate after dinner. Angela, our friend who made the reservation said when she called they told her we could get those services until 10 PM. So, we relaxed.

We ordered our cheese and cooking options and then some drinks. The drinks took forever to arrive. Seriously. We had almost completely finished our cheese fondue by the time the drinks arrived. 

The cheese option we selected was a spinach and artichoke white cheese concoction that was delicious. But isn't anything with cheese delicious? :-)

There were several times when we complained (to ourselves) about our lack of drinks. Later, when one of our friends said she would want to order another martini in about 5 minutes, our waiter said, \"I should probably go put it in now, though, considering how backed up they are.\" We thought, 'Oh wow, they are really busy with this promotion.' Turns out they had no glasses. In fact, the Ahwatukee location had to run over glasses for Scottsdale. I thought it very odd that the restaurant would advertise a big Girls' Night Out event and not be prepared for ladies wanting drinks. Oh well. 

We choose the basic bouillion cooking style, and our plates contained sirloin, filet, chicken, shrimp, butternut squash ravioli, and an assortment of veggies. It was a ton of food! We were not expecting to get so much at the discounted price. 

Our chocolate fondue choices were limited to milk, dark or white. Three of us were up for dark and one wanted white, so Cody was nice enough to bring her a little bowl of white chocolate. We had a ton of dessert .... And it was delicious.

Meanwhile, a woman from Mary Kay came over carrying a basket of what looked like presents. She asked us if we had heard about the drawing yet, and we said no. She said, \"OK, well, I'll just leave these entry forms here with you.\" And, she did. But, she never told us what the drawing was for .... and she never returned. She asked us \"Does anyone have any Mary Kay products in their purse.\" One of my friends did, and she got \"a prize\" - one of the presents. Then she asked us, \"Does anyone have any lipstick at all.\" We all did. We all got \"presents.\" Our present was a bag of marketing materials, which was kind of a let down. 

Next, the bill. This got a little weird because there were additional charges on our bill that didn't make sense to us. We paid with three credit cards, and all I know is I was charged $6 more than I should have been, and my friends who had either higher priced drinks or multiple drinks paid less. We asked the waiter about some of the charges, and apparently one of the drinks ordered was not on the set menu and was therefore extra. Though, we had asked about making an adjustment and he never said it would be more. 

We excitedly went to the courtyard for our treatments and discovered that everyone was either gone or was cleaning up! And it was still early! That was a bummer ....

So, overall, the food was great, and it was so nice to connect with friends over a leisurely dinner. The price was perfect - about $40 a person when you consider drinks and tip - and if they do another such event, I will go again, but try to arrive early to make the most of the activities."}
{"text":"We took friends visiting from France to the Melting Pot last week.  The experience began very nice besides getting past the sort of odd smell when you walk in the door.  The bartender seemed to be out of his element as he took one person's and then made the cocktail ..took the next person's order then made the cocktail....one at a time ( it took us 20 mins to get our 7 drinks ) then when we were seated it took a while for our waiter to greet us.  Our waiter was nice and knowledgeable.  During the course of our dinner we discovered some discrepancies and when we brought the items to the attention of the Manager he was professional and courteous and absolutely made the situation right.  We will return."}
{"text":"Great place for an entertaining dinner. It is expensive but the food/experience is wonderful. Dinner took a solid 2 hours.  I used to think fondue was only cheese...."}
{"text":"Worst Melting Pot in The Country. First of all, we do The Melting Pot every year for Christmas Eve for the past 15 years. 7 years in Dallas, TX, 7 Years in Denver, CO, and now our first year in Scottsdale, AZ.  I have also visited in Atlanta. Food is consistent with every other Melting Pot we have been too.  Problem is service, wine list, and beer list. Worst wine list of any restaurant I have ever been too. Very disappointing for us because we always look forward to a bottle of Jordan, or stags leap, or cake bread, etc. none of these available. Service was awful. Slowest I have ever seen.

Concern I have is that this melting pot seems different than any other I have been to. I asked management and they stated ownership is trying to do things different.  May want to reconsider and listen to your customers first.  Perhaps Gordon Ramsey could come do a kitchen nightmares episode here!

We will find a new Christmas Eve tradition."}
{"text":"We waited to be seated in the empty restaurant in spite of having a reservation. No explanation, no \"it should just be a few more minutes\", nothing. Not a deal breaker but still a poor start. 
I gave two stars because our server was sweet. I wish we could turn back time and get our $300 back. All of the the fish was fishy and the vegetables were not fresh. (Maybe I prepared my food wrong?) The food seemed really low budget with a terribly bloated price tag. 
The kids thought it was fun but we still won't return. My overall feeling about the whole dinner was \"ick\"."}
{"text":"Fun concept, poor execution. The food was horrible plus $200 for two people! Plus the four course meal took 3 hours. Save your money and dine elsewhere."}
{"text":"This was my first time at the Melting Pot and it definitely won't be my last! The food was delicious, our server/waiter Jeremy was extremely nice, accommodating and explained everything we needed to know, making the experience all the better!  Plus, ending the night with a classic chocolate fondue was just the icing to a perfect meal."}
{"text":"I love melting pot!  Great place to celebrate anything.

It is great for kids too. We celebrated my son's 12th birthday and he loved it."}
{"text":"My six year old daughter and I enjoyed a fun and memorable date night at Melting Pot last night. It was her first exposure to fondue and we had a blast eating great food and talking about her first three days of first grade. We starteed with a fantastic spinach and artichoke fontina & butterkäse cheese fondue, then shared the \"Land & Sea\" (filet mignon, chicken and shrimp). Of course, when the dessert menu came out so did a bit more enthusiasm. She had never dreamed of seeing a pot of melted chocolate before. The looks on her face were priceless. She chose the \"Cookies 'n Cream Marshmallow Dream\" and it was crazy good. I'm looking forward to taking the whole family and to making this a more common stop on our date night calendar."}
{"text":"Well where do I start.. We went for 2018 Valentine's day. Bought the $124 dollar package thinking it was gonna be awesome.  Which included 5 course meal. 6 roses. Curtain seating. $25 gift card. Bottle of wine. Couples picture and frame all in a Valentine gift bag. Was sat for our 8pm reservation and had to wait 15 min just to order. We got our drinks and food ordered($8 for 12oz can beer that the waitress brought to the table and opened in front of us) B.S! Took forever to get our meal. Waitress keep saying \" sorry for the wait I'm just slammed\"
Got our food . THUMBS UP to the back staff for great preparation . Fast forward 3 hrs later and got the bill for $350 bucks. Curtain seating that was crapped and very small for 2. Did not get our bottle of wine. Did not get a picture or frame of us. Did not get $25 dollar gift card . We were so pissed from this experience.  We will never come here again and I WILL tell everyone I know, not to come here. Go to a McDonald's and a Motel parking lot. cheaper. Lol
Oh ya. 2 stars for back staff and the dessert
Otherwise  negative -5 stars"}
{"text":"First time but not the last. Dinner takes awhile as your pot heats up for each dish but the food was really good. We both did the 4 course with the chocolate dip dessert. Soo good!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! The staff was friendly and informative and the food was delicious. Our server Ashley (not sure if that's the right spelling) was sweet and friendly, she even asked if it was alright if she used us to train a newbie first, which was very considerate. The newbie, who I forgot her name, did a spectacular job even though we could tell she was nervous. My only complaint was that the prices were insanely high. I wouldn't recommend going unless you had a coupon or are prepared to pay at least $30 a person. I also felt a little under dressed, but that's not the restaurants fault. Everything else was good though, and I will return in the future!"}
{"text":"Very impressed by the management here. I should have posted this a few week ago when it happened, but it was good enough that I remembered it that much later. 

We're not sure exactly what happened, but when our server wasn't fully keeping up with everything the managers stepped in to complete our orders (with the all of the adjustments we were asking for), and helped keep everything going smoothly for us. I'm sure some management may have just left us to sit there waiting, but they stepped up and made sure we had a great experience."}
{"text":"The Melting Pot is a dining EXPERIENCE. If you get a private booth, it can be a very romantic dining experience. 

Heres the deal...As mentioned in other reviews, the food is good but not amazing (except for dessert!). Set aside a good 2 1/2 - 3 hours for dinner, drinks and conversation. It takes a while. If you are one of those who likes to order, eat and get the hell out...this is not the place for you. Be ready to relax, have a few drinks and take your time. The cheese course, salad and main course are there as distractions. The spotlight is firmly held on the dessert course! Its freeking amazing!!! We haven't had a dessert at the melting pot that we didn't LOVE!"}
{"text":"We love Melting Pot and come to this location 2-3 times a year. We go for the wine flight and highly recommend the Gorgonzola fondue! Check out their weekly special events."}

Would try this place again :)"}
{"text":"We celebrated our 6 year wedding anniversary last night at the Meling Pot and had a wonderful experience.  It was our first time going and they really did a great job personalizing the experience.  We had a card and flowers waiting for us at our table and the wait staff all congratulated us on our celebration.  That doesn't mean much if the food isn't good but it was deeee-lish!  We had the Big Night Out and was able to customize the menu to our liking.  Although the main entree wasn't much more than a glorified hot pot at a Chinese restuarant, it was still awesome.  You can't go wrong with dipping your appetizer in melted cheese and your desserts in chocolate.  We would definitely go there again!"}
{"text":"Pretty delicious! The melting pot is always one of my favorites. The service is always great (Ashley didn't disappoint during our visit yesterday). The food is consistently delicious. The quality is good but it's up to you to prepare it correctly. My one complaint and the reason I gave 4 vs 5 stars, I was charged $39.95 for the endless fondue but the website and the manager informed me that it'd be $36.95. It's only a $3 difference but, hey, that $3 could have covered my coffee."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for a date night.

We had a table right next to the fireplace.  
Our server was slow at first, but very kind and a lot of fun.

The food was delicious.  We had a cheese fondue, salads, and an endless meat fondue.  Keep in mind this isn't your typical restaurant.  You don't go and get served ready-to-eat food.  You get served food that you cook in the fondue pot.  If you're OK with that, this is a lot of fun.  It can get a bit overwhelming keeping track of cooking times, but it's worth it.

We regret not getting a chocolate fondue for dessert, but we were way too full."}
{"text":"Restaurant week is a great deal at the Melting Pot!  Always a fun meal!"}

{"text":"Went here tonight for dinner for AZ restaurant week, very good choice. The whole process takes about 2 hours but it is always nice to just relax during the meal. Both my boyfriend and I decided to get the cheddar cheese fondue and the bouillon fondue for the meats. Both very good. We also got the house margarita and a strawberry lemonade. Very good portion size for what you pay for and the slow pace of it makes so that you get full. We noticed that service was suuuuper slow though to get our main meal, but our server took the liberty of taking care of our drinks because of the wait. Great service! Hoping to be back soon to try the happy hour!"}
{"text":"This was a great experience.  There were 7 of us for dinner with different dietary needs and they accommodated everyone.  John, the Assistant Manager, called the day before to make sure he had everyone's menu needs correct.  The service was outstanding with Emily our server making sure everyone was happy.  Great place for special events.  This was truly a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Was alright. I think places like the Melting Pot are more about the experience than the food itself. Which makes sense, you always hear of people taking their wives/husbands, dates, here. Definitely not a casual place where you hit up every Friday, though I wouldn't be surprised if that market of consumers existed too.

So we ordered four different land meats and/or seafood items. They were alright. The reliance on dipping sauces to make the food taste good is a little unsettling but a classic hallmark of American cooking it seems."}
{"text":"nice food terrible service. Can't even get a second spoon! Rude waitress and manager. She came by to tell us off because we asked for extra spoon veggies and bread . We have been here about 30 times. This was the worst service ever!"}
{"text":"The food here was awesome! The staff was very respectful and helpful. The seating in this restaurant was very intimate. It did not feel like we were having dinner in the same building with a bunch of other people."}
{"text":"Reason: my birthday celebration late last year (December)

Service: thoughtful, friendly and helpful 

Cool points: cozy ambience, great place to commemorate special occasions, on the romantical side  

Food: the bf loves hatch chili so our starter cheese fondue was easy to choose and it was pretty yummy. We went with the seafood option because I was wanting scallops and they paired nicely with the sauces provided, they were tender and buttery. Of course, the dessert is truly the sweet ending of an otherwise savory dinner. We opted for classic dark chocolate that did not disappoint. The server brought the plate and stuck a bday candle in the brownie, that was a nice touch. 

I will definitely return, they have a pretty fabulous happy hour though I have never been."}
{"text":"A little over priced and the quality may be good but the entertainment is what we all come for.  Cheese and chocolate.  Yes please"}
{"text":"First off, this was the BEST dining experience! My wife and I ate here for Valentine's Day. Our server Nick was friendly and down to earth. He made the night even better for us with great service and meaningful conversation. 

The food was so full of flavor, the salad was surprisingly good. This is coming from someone that hates salads! The meats have such distinct flavors! Writing about it makes me want to go back! Oh my god, the dark chocolate with Heath toffee! With all those great desserts to dip them in! Amazing!

I had a slight hiccup in making the reservation, but the manager in the red sweater vest took care of us. He was very kind and accommodating. Good people work here!

My wife wants to know if we can get toast to dip instead? Ha! The white bread was ok, not great. That was the only thing! So GREAT work!"}
{"text":"The service was good. However, this place seems tired and dull. This place used to be very popular not anymore.... overpriced with small portions. I have been going to melting pot for years and the last few visits make not want to come back. We got the alpine fondue which reminded me nothing of Switzerland. The awful wine overpowered the cheese make it almost not edible. Meat fondue portion was pretty flavorless. And the chocolate fondue which always should be win... was lacking with various dippers such as packaged rice crispy treats (those cheap ones in blue package). These should be homemade. Will not be back for the cost and food quality lots of other great places to eat in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Awesome experience !! Have been here numerous times but tonight was the best experience yet. The food is always what you expect but the service was much different tonight. Mike, who was our server did a phenomenal job taking care of us. His customer service, pride, and product knowledge is the best I have seen in a long time. If you end up going to the melting pot for dinner, and if you want the ultimate experience, please ask for Mike. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Everyone needs to do the Fondue experience at least twice in their lifetime right? My first experience was dining multiple times at another place in Northern California where they allowed you to cook with a grill. Manager says the chain is testing this concept, but since my fondue grilling took place  over 10 years ago, it seems that they are woefully lagging behind the times. You essentially have to boil your food and if you want a more flavorful experience go for the mushroom broth which of course involves an upgrade fee of six bucks.
    Join the Club - Get 6 free chocolate covered strawberries to go 
Prices - Just order one entree for two people and without drinks, you can get out for $60.
Food - the cheese fondue was a bit bland, but the chocolate berry crunch was a tasty end.
Dippers - Order the upgraded desert dippers for $5 and you get some good dipping options including cookie stix, cheesecake and better berries.
Main Course - Well the house salad was bagged, but the sweet dressing was drinkable good.
  We got the entree that is most popular and most meats were pretty good/seasoned with the Teriakyi steak and shrimp stealing the show. Somehow, also the broccoli was great too after soaking up all the soupy broth. Lots of garlic involved also in all items.

The booths were private, the server was nice, the manager checked on us twice and they gave us that special happy Anniversary plate. They do a nice job of making you feel special and most people are celebrating something, but next time will check out the Happy Hour where you can do fondue a new and cheaper way."}
{"text":"Excellent for romantic occasions or with a group of friends. Prepare to take your time though it is something that you don't want to rush through. Each course is fun and can be interesting. But what  I love the most is their wine selection. They have a few of my favorites. Definitely worth the experience."}
{"text":"Things started off unpleasant which is really hard for a restaurant to bounce back from, in my opinion. The host had major attitude from the moment we walked in and seemed annoyed she had to work. That set our happy, excited mood to a very sour one. Thankfully the manager Emily came up and took over since I had accidentally moved the reservation to the wrong date when updating the number of guests and the host wasn't being helpful. The only other big negative was that the printer wouldn't work so we had to wait 30 minutes at the end of our meal before we could pay and leave. It was late and we were ready to go but I can't blame a restaurant for that, it's out of their control.

On to the POSITIVES!! Our server Holly was great! She was super friendly, knowledgeable, and had a great personality. She did announce the wrong nonprofit when she first told us about the menu however the manager mentioned she was new and that the beneficiary was still the correct one (we are volunteers for the nonprofit receiving a portion of the proceeds this month). Holly also came back to check on us periodically which was nice so I could order a second glass of wine.

I hadn't been to a Melting Pot in years and the food was really fantastic! There were lots of great choices and we started off with the Spinach Artichoke cheese dip and that was great! The proteins with our entrees were also quite delicious and it was fun to make our own meals. We chose the Smores dessert and that was definitely the highlight of the meal! Very tasty and I can't believe how much they give you to dip in the chocolate fondue.

It's worth going here for something different. Had there not been a screaming toddler near us and a friendly human at the host podium, this would have been a higher rating. Ambiance includes hiring friendly, welcoming employees. I've worked at many high end establishments when I was young and people make or break these restaurants."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a quiet romantic night.  I have been to the Melting Pot only twice and both times it was this one up in Scottsdale.  The first time we had a full dinner which was fabulous and this last time we only got desert.  The desert was at a great price and we walked out of there an hour or so later, feeling relaxed and full of chocolate fondue for only 25 bucks.

I really enjoy this place, but if you're a chocolate fan, be sure to save room for desert because it is to die for."}
{"text":"I travel each and every week of my life away from my family, so I tend to explore the area to find fun places to eat.  Fondue seemed like a natural choice for fun!!  

My friend Zach and I stumbled in to The Melting Pot on a random Tuesday early in the month of July and it was LADIES NIGHT!!!  How fun!  The manager was so kind as to offer the special to both of us...even tho one of us was not a lady.  The fondue was amazing.  Salad fresh.  Cheese course was wonderfully cheesey...and the meat/chocolate courses were amazing.  I can't use another word to describe everything except for amazing!  the biggest surprise of the dinner was the restaurant manager Ivars Melbardis!  He came over to our table, thanked us for coming in and inquired about why were were in town and how often we would be back.  He asked that we come back in and see him again if we get the chance.  We also were impressed with the server when we couldn't agree on the flavor of chocolate because one of us wanted the one that they light on fire and I wanted one that didn't come with the fire show.  The server brought out the one that didn't come with a fire show and surprised us with a little flaumbe action!!  It was great!

What lead me to write this review is that we came back to town, my co-worker Stephanie and I and hit up The Melting Pot for dinner on Father's Day.  We tried to go somewhere fun in honor of our husbands that we were forced to leave home because of our work schedule.  Not only was the food just as wonderful, service top notch, but the manager again knocked my socks off with his wonderfulness!  Ivars not only remembered me from last time, but he e offered us beer samples from local breweries, told us the best places to eat where we can get them on tap and gave us gifts to take home to our husbands.  How kind is that!  You couldn't ask for a better manager.  It is his engagement that will keep me coming back to his restaurant.  Thank you for thinking of my husband even tho he couldn't be there!!"}
{"text":"I am rating this 4 out of 5 stars because it is really pricey, but keep in mind, that does come along with a great experience. 

This is a really cool place--awesome atmosphere and an overall unique dining experience. I went with some friends for a \"girls' night out\" special they were having and I had a great time! 

I have heard a lot of comments from other people (not on Yelp, but from friends/co-workers) about \"why would you pay so much to cook your own food?\" Well, that's kind of the purpose of this place and what makes it fun and distinctive! 

If you plan on going to any Melting Pot location don't expect to get out of there in an hour. The whole process takes about two to three hours, but it gives you plenty of time to catch up with friends and not feel like you are being rushed out of there. 

I know it changes on different nights, but when I went this is how it was: first there is an appetizer portion. They give you different cheeses to choose from for the fondue Next is the main course with different meats and veggies. Lastly is the desert part. I think the desert itself is the best part for sure. It's a little smaller portion than I would have hoped for, but it was really tasty. They had three different chocolate types to choose from: white chocolate, milk chocolate, and dark chocolate. 

I love this place and will definitely be back, hopefully sometime soon!"}
{"text":"My best friend is a Melting Pot Groupie.  It is one of  her favorite places on earth and when a Groupon popped up, she persuaded me to give it another shot.  (I had been many, many years ago and while we enjoyed our meal, we thought it was overly expensive.)  

Our meal started out with a waiter who was clearly having some issues.  After being seated and mentioning our Groupon, you could almost see his face fall like we were The Table Of The Unwashed.  \"Oh.  That's a different menu.  I'll go get those,\" as he whisked away our regular paying person menus and hoped that we would not choose to trim our toenails at the table.  

Shortly afterward, my bestie asked for the manager and explained that our server was providing a less than stellar (and I'm being generous here) experience.  To his credit, the manager apologized and replaced our server with one who seemed to enjoy her life.  

Beyond that, it was a lovely evening.  The waitress was friendly and engaging.  The food was good.  The drinks were good.  When the bill arrived, I still felt it was awfully expensive (even with the Groupon) given that we were cooking our own food.  I enjoyed myself but I will say that it's just not my thing."}
{"text":"I went to the Melting Pot with my husband to celebrate our wedding anniversary. the dining experience is good. Honestly, I loved the melting cheddar cheese and the food was very delicious. The salad was fresh. What i did not like was the waiter..he was not very friendly. Another negative point is the waiting time. We stayed four hours in that restaurant because we cook our own food:) I want to add that the dessert was great as well
I totally recommend it if you do not mind sitting for 4 hours in the same place:)"}
{"text":"I went to the Melting Pot with my mother, 7 year old daughter and boyfriend for my 37th birthday and it was awesome! This is such a fantastic place to have a nice dinner with people you care about. The food is amazing and the service is great. It took 3 hours for us to complete our 4 course meal. We chose to do the all you can eat style 4 course meal which includes a salad. We were stuffed!! I'd recommend this to anyone looking to have a great meal and spend time with people you care about and enjoy."}
{"text":"The host greeted us with how can I help you with a straight face... in a dine in restaurant . I thought it was an odd question. I had to wait few seconds before I answered him . He was looking at us as if we were aliens. Anyways , then he told us that we had to wait 20 minutes to get seated in an empty restaurant. I got a very cold vibe from him . Never going to that location again ."}
{"text":"First time being here and looking forward to come back ! De li ci ous food and what a relaxing atmosphere ! We were very welcome and our waitress provided great service! We invite you to live this experience!! Best way to start weekend!"}
{"text":"I've seen this restaurant all over the country but never went because I thought it was pricey for what you get.  Fortunately, Deal Chicken offered a $100 4-course meal and a bottle of wine for 4 people. Definitely worth the experience for that price. 

First of all the building and all the neighboring stores are dark at night. Not a very inviting complex if you've never been to the area.  However, the interior is decorated and set up very nicely, typical of a traditional steakhouse.  Be sure to ask for table with dual tops if you want to try different fondues. Kind of silly to force 4 people to agree on one item imo. 

Since we sat at a double stove, we got two cheese fondues, everyone had a house or ceased salad, then we get two entree hot pots (mojo and regular), then two desserts (we had yin/yang and bananas foster).  Overall the food quality was very good with a few misses. Bread pieces were cold and stale. Cake/cheesecake were dry. The house wine was pretty awful for this caliber restaurant, but I guess it never claims to be a wine place.  I didn't have problems with the filet as some others said. I was actually surprised by how tender the meat was. Other endless entrees were chicken, teriyaki steak,  shrimp, and a vegetable ravioli. You get to request as many refills of the entree items as you want.  Sauces were great and changed up each bite.

It's a fun and interactive meal. We spent 3 hours total, which I wasn't expecting so don't be in a hurry afterwards. Service started good but then she disappeared somewhere after the 2nd course.  

Overall: I wouldn't come back at regular prices.  Maybe just for dessert if you want a romantic date. Or simply have someone else pay. =)"}
{"text":"Great place for a very leisurely dinner. Seriously, it's gonna take 3 hours so I hope you like who you're with!! 

NOT GOOD FOR FIRST DATES. 

When I'm there I usually get the dinner for 2 with whoever i'm with - cheese fondue, salad & meat courses. Then we're STUFFED with no room for dessert. Here are a few alternatives I've found:

1. Go in and order individual dinners, not the dinner for 2 thing. This way you each get a meat course (I think it comes w/ salad too)  and then you will have room for dessert. 

2. Go in JUST for dessert. (This is my favorite thing to do with my sister - it's great girl time!) Have a very light dinner at home or wherever and then you can sit and eat chocolate fondue yumminess and drink good coffee. (They have great coffee). I also highly recommend the espresso martini."}
{"text":"Great food, drinks, and service. Fiesta Cheese and Flaming Turtle are the best cheese and chocolate fondues!"}
{"text":"This is the perfect date night, girls night and celebration type of restaurant. The ambiance is on point, the staff is always so nice and really enhance the experience. There is absolutely nothing that I do not love about the Melting Pot especially at this location. I have been coming to this restaurant regularly for awhile now and never once have I had a bad experience. Lastly, I will say I do appreciate the fact that management always comes over to ask how the experience has been and they seem very genuine inside of doing a quick drive by and not even bothering to make eye contact like so many other gm's will do. This is a go to spot!"}
{"text":"Bought a DealChicken special for our anniversary...Super happy!!

This was a terrific dining experience! Ambiance is romantic and quiet. The staff was attentive and helpful to use first timers. 

I have always wanted to do Fondue but hadn't until now. I wasn't disappointed! I read the Yelp reviews before hand, so I had an idea of what I was walking into. No surprise that dinner took 2 1/2 hours. But we were celebrating and I LOVE the company so no complaint! Celebrate we did! Our waiter was super in guiding us through the experience and helping us decide what flavors. Everything was really tasty! There is a seasoning that is called Garlic and Wine that they serve as a seasoning and we brought ourselves home a bottle and use it on all kinds of stuff, but mainly our salad. It was a good deal for only 7.98.

In conclusion, I don't really care to have my meat basically boiled so I wouldn't be a regular...But I will be back for the cheese dip and dessert portion of the meal. My honey on the other hand had no problem with the entire dinner and looks forward to returning."}
{"text":"My boyfriend brought me here for a reservation at 9pm on September 3rd for my birthday. It was my first time experiencing the place and I loved it! The drinks were delicious, the food excellent, and the price was what I expected. Our server was Dallas and she was absolutely wonderful! This girl knows how to make her customers feel welcomed and relaxed! And she was fun! 

Thank you for a great birthday, Melting Pot!"}
{"text":"The melting pot is a classic spot. Awesome experience and better service. Tyler was our server and took care of us - she was great and made our dining experience very enjoyable."}
{"text":"This is probably the most expensive restaurants I've ever been too, but it's sooooooo worth it. Everything was delicious and the service was amazing. It was fun getting to chill my own food and it's set up in such a way that is almost impossible to ruin your meal. Every bite was better than the last. I took my wife here for our anniversary and they brought our dessert dippers on a \"Happy Anniversary\"plate."}
{"text":"I can honestly say I've never had anything that taste worse. It was comparable to airplane food. I'm definitely not a fan of cooking my own food - but that's not why this is getting 1 star. I get that's part of the experience, just not one I enjoy. The steak was absolutely tasteless and the cheese was just bland. I really wish they'd put better ventilation in the restaurant as well because the smell of all the burning pots was enough to kill my appetite. Worst food I've ever had. Ever."}
{"text":"Let me say first off, that I'm a cheese lover. Daughter of tried and true New England types, there aint nothin' better than extra sharp Vermont cheddar or my Swiss brother in law's homemade fondue. So when my now-unfortunate ex and I got pregnant 3 weeks after the blissful wedding event, we went to The Melting Pot to celebrate. It was a repeat visit and I've more recently been to the Phoenix location [Ray Rd]. I echo the reports of others: alot of money, alot of time and not particularly genius. It's a nice 'experience' . I think its okay fondue, I'd pass on the meat course and since liquid chocolate isn't really my thing, I'd just go for the cheese course. 

Given that, I can stay home and make my own Welsh Rarebit and wait for the next time my brother in law is in town and save myself some serious time and money."}
{"text":"This is more about experience than food (in my opinion). Don't get me wrong, the food is good but its WAY expensive. Me and friends went and had a great time and if you've never done the fondue thing, you should try it sometime."}
{"text":"Amazing dinner experience! Jason explained and prepared our 4 course fondue dinner. He and the manager, Emily were very attentive. We will be back soon! 10/10."}
{"text":"Every now and then you want to treat yourself to something fun and different. The Melting Pot does a great job in doing just that. This is not the place for those looking for a quick bite to eat, instead dinner is served at a leisurely pace that you gives you plenty of time to enjoy your food and your company.

I've been here many times of the years. When you can get a Groupon or Living Social deal, grab it! Dinner is pricey but the experience is worth it. Tonight we had the four course meal which was a cheese fondue, salad, entree, and chocolate. We started out with the Gorgonzola and bacon cheese fondue which comes with bread, veggies and apples to dip in it. Cheese and bread....DELICIOUS! I couldn't get enough. The second course was a salad. I had the house salad and my husband had the Caesar. They certainly weren't the best salads we have ever had but they are decent. For the entree I had sirloin, chicken and shrimp and my husband had a Cajun platter with beef, chicken, shrimp and sausage. Tonight we choose the mojo cooking method but there a several other choices and they are all pretty yummy. We finished off the meal with the s'mores chocolate fondue which came with a platter of fruit, brownies, pound cake, marshmallows, and rice crispy treats. The chocolate really is the best part.

We passed on the cocktails tonight but have enjoyed them in the past. The drink menu is definitely worth browsing."}
{"text":"My daughter took me here for my birthday and we had a wonderful meal!  I LOVE fondue!  For two people they offer the 4 course for one price (all you can eat), and it contained all the different fondues we love.  

The nice thing about eating here is it requires conversing.  So many Americans today don't sit and enjoy a meal and talk.  As cooking fondue is a process, you go from one course to the other in a relaxing and enjoyable style.  It is a little dark in there, but it provides for an intimate ambiance.  

The staff was fantastic.  A little slow the night we were there, but they didn't treat us like it.  Everyone wished me a Happy Birthday which was really nice.  Service was awesome, fondue was perfect. 

This restaurant provides a relaxing ambiance that is perfect for a special meal. I would recommend."}
{"text":"This was such a wonderful restaurant, my fiancee and I had the most romantic and fun time here. Highly recommended for a date night! You will not leave hungry!!"}
{"text":"Michael was an amazing server and deserves a raise for sure! Made us girls feel special and very well taken care of! Will definitely come back again soon!!"}
{"text":"This a cool experience.

A very romantic setting with low lights and you can sit in a very separated booth from everybody else.

The waiters are very nice explaining everything very well.  I had never had experience with fondue and I greatly appreciated that explanation.  The photo, later on in the night, is a nice touch. 

Pricey.  It was like $90 a couple.  That's just for the basic four course meal... doesn't include the wine or anything.

Plan on being there for 3 hours.  A very nice time when you are with someone you love and just enjoy being with them.

I'm hoping to go back soon."}
{"text":"My wife and I went for a date night and we had a wonderful time! Our waiter Jeremy was funny and charming. He suggested great options for us to try and we loved them all! The manager was super friendly as he stopped by our table to check in. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I went for AZ Restaurant Week. The wait staff were incredibly nice and really take a lot of time to explain everything if you're new as week as the cooking process. They were very willing to make dietary substitutions. Be prepared for a long meal though. I only had 1.5hrs and even with a reservation, I had to quickly stuff my face with dessert in order to make it out of there a little over 2hrs. So don't go unless you're prepared to sit down for a while. The atmosphere is ok. It's very romantic so if you're going with friends and just want to talk and laugh, it might not be the best place. The food was alright. I don't think it's good enough to justify the prices, especially since you're making your own food. Save your money, go buy a fondue set and do it at home. But it's definately worth the experience on time. I just personally will not be going back."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the melting pot my husband and I go here every year on out anniversary and it's really a fun experience! The food is amazing and the service is even better, With the private booth of course! I would recommend everyone try out and I'm sure you'll enjoy it"}
{"text":"Our waitress, Amanda was FANTASTIC! She was attentive, super nice and we had great conversation with her. Emily on the other hand is the wicked b*tch from the west! Her sass and lack of eye contact is less than desirable when dealing with a manager. I felt like she wasn't listening to me but instead looking everywhere else in the room. Furthermore, when we asked for additional dippers for our chocolate she wouldn't bring them out but we have had them every single time before. Amanda definitely smoothed things over and we will be back again solely because of her grace and class. In fact, she should be made the manager! In the future I really hope to not see Emily at all."}
{"text":"My daughter chose this restaurant for her birthday dinner. We were very pleased with the experience. The waiter was helpful and efficient. I find it overpriced so I would save this place for special occasions only. Or when someone else is paying."}
{"text":"My wife and I love to have Fondue and this place is probably #2 on my list all time of great Fondue spots. The private booth for two with a curtain was fantastic and a nice surprise. 

The quality of the dippers was great too, and I actually got more than I expected. Some fondue spots like to limit each meat selection to three pieces at most, but I was happy to see 4 or 5 pieces of the meats. Not the shrimp though, strictly three shrimp for the classic and the cajun entrees. 

The service was just right. Not bothering us too much, not leaving us hanging for the whole meal. 

A couple of negatives. Not the end of the world, but noticeable enough to comment. What does it take to get some light in there? I mean, Edison invented the light bulb in 1879. Seems like this place got left in the dark. So freaking dark in there I really could hardly tell which piece of meat was cooked and which wasn't, let alone tell the difference between pork and chicken. Also, they went a little short on both the cheese, and the dessert chocolate. We have quite a few dippers left and the cheese or chocolate was gone. I've been to quite a few fondue joints that had plenty of cheese or chocolate to spare and the wait staff was asking if we wanted more dippers. 

Overall a good experience though."}
{"text":"Amazing dinner! My husband and I did the St. Jude's donation dinner which was a four course meal. First set was the cheese, we had the delicious spinach and artichoke dip. Along with a house salad, which was delicious. Then we had delicious surf and turf along with ying and yang dessert. It was my husband and I's first wedding anniversary and they decorated the private booth with flower petals, it was beautiful!!"}
{"text":"Went to the melting pot for my husband and I's wedding anniversary a few weeks ago. The service was good the food was tasty, but now I remember why we don't go very often ..because it is so darn expensive and you cook your own food!! It was nice to have the photo of us that they took as a memento, however that was the extent of the anniversary goodies. (They have an anniversary package that they make you pay extra for which we did not get). The restaurant was also super dark inside. Probably won't be going back anytime soon since our bill was well over $100.. Yikes.."}
{"text":"Fun experience but pricey.  You are given raw meat to cook yourself.  If you have kids (or if you are having wine), you worry whether there is enough concentration to make sure the meat cooked enough.  I did not like the clove sauce they cooked everything in.  Great place for desert though...go just for that!"}
{"text":"Having a ying for a taste of Switzerland.. I decide to celebrate a special persons birthday here.. Kind of to remind her of Europe.. well.. the price reminded me of Switzerland.. but the authenticity isnt there.. AND they have a menu that says a Alpine Nite.. dont be fooled.. most cheese fondues do not have grainy mustard in them.. We did the price fix menu.. starting with the cheese fondue.. a salad.. the meat and seafood course.. (a small amount for two considering the price was about $45 each).. chocolate fondue.. with too much amaretto in the chocolate.. the experience is cool.. but if youve been to Switzerland.. dont go in here thinking your getting authentic.. my advice.. hit up Sur La Table and get your own fondue pot.. do it at home.. and youll get more authentic.. am I snob.. proudly.."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there to celebrate her birthday recently, and it was phenominal. Everything was incredibly delicious, and there is a sort of entertainment aspect as the wait staff preps the cheese and chocolate at your table. The protein portion puts you in charge of your food prep to an extent, as you sqewer, dip, and time the cooking of the raw protiens in the oil fondu. We found it to be a delicious and entertaining evening! Be prepare to spend about 2.5 hours there if you are eating all 4 courses, but the time flies and is enjoyable throughout."}
{"text":"Wow...I mean what more can you say?! Last night we celebrated our 4-year anniversary and throughout our 2-hour stay we couldn't stop saying how this place exceeded our expectations. When we arrived we were seated promptly in a private corner away from everyone else by window doors with real and fragrant rose petals on the table, and we were lucky enough to watch a thunderstorm roll in which made the night even more romantic. I think our server's name was Jennifer? (Jessica? Sorry but she was amazing! Give this woman a raise! She's so funny and laid back! haha) We had never been to the Melting Pot before but it's so true when they say it isn't just a dinner, it's a dining experience! It was so neat the way she prepared all the fondues in front of us...Everything was flavored so perfectly and I'm all about trying new things in my own kitchen so it was fun and relatable. Again, the shrimp and steaks and veggies were SO TASTY. We opted to get the wine infused broth...worth the extra money because it kept our corner smelling good all night and I myself like cooking with wine. ;) I also got a couple Love Martinis to go with it...seriously the tastiest martinis I've had. They're usually so strong and bitter but these were enjoyable and refreshing....To end the night we got smores fondue and our plate of treats was decorated with a cute little candle that said \"Happy Anniversary\" which was really nice. There was never a time where we were just sitting there waiting for our next course or for our drinks to be refilled...everything was so timely you'd swear they'd have someone monitoring a camera at all times like Go go go hahaha!!! Overall we cannot say enough great things about our experience and we will be coming back with friends! Thank you so much to all the staff and our server who made us a priority! You guys rock!!!"}
{"text":"Well... I'll start positive. Atmosphere is great, service was great, and overall the food was good.

That being said the price is far too much in my opinion. I'm  a ok paying for good food and classy dining. However we were in a large group and I felt like the portions were equal to what two people would normally get although we had at least 3-4 around each pot. (Also to mention folks in our group who'd been there before said the portions were no bigger than when they went as a couple) 

I would go back however I'd most likely go for some drinks (all reasonably priced) possibly cheese and dessert."}
{"text":"While the Melting Pot is a chain, the service we received at this location was amazing.  We arrived later in the evening and Ralph was our waiter.  He did great with assisting a very indecisive group.  His humor meshed well with ours and he kept us laughing all evening which really added to the evening."}
{"text":"My Beloved's birthday is always both an exhilarating experience for me; as well as, a journey back to the date of when my one and only love was born on this earth.

Hence, the trouble I go through to spend the entire month celebrating such a significant date. And picking the right place to celebrate is certainly a key component to successfully celebrating this auspicious event.

I had made these reservations weeks in advance, and reserved a booth. 

I paid the added fee to prepare the booth for her birthday. That's the reason why there were visible rose petals in the pictures, which were strewn over our table in a decorative fashion.

We ordered the 4-course experience, which opened with a delectable combination of fresh vegetables, meats, and delicate croutons. When dipped in the cheese filled pot, the accompanying mixture made for heavenly introduction to our meal. The cheese wasn't too overpowering.

Then came the salad, which tasted fresh and crispy. And the house dressing added a wonderfully delicate balance. 

Afterwards, the mixture of meats and seafood arrived. Steak, Chicken, Shrimp, Lobster, and Ravioli. By now, the cheese pot had been substituted with a new pot that had a special broth to cook the meats and seafood in.

This is typically where the negative comments regarding the lack of flavor stems from. The Bouillon, even though it is advertised to be full of flavor, can be emaciated (weakened) by the cooking (and boiling process). The food, when boiled at the prescribed duration, still doesn't quite allow for the mixture to seep into the meats. It comes off as being bland. 

What we did was cook it much longer than prescribed, and this allowed to the flavors really sink in. We discovered this early enough in the process, and it truly improved our overall experience with this cooking process.

After the main course, came the dessert. We had the pure chocolate, along with the sweet additions. This came with cream puffs, berries and other delectable items, that when dipped in chocolate, would send our palates soaring! Sublime and Divine are not enough superlatives to describe our palate's experience.

As noted by other seasoned reviewers, the Melting Pot Fondue experience is not as authentic as that which one could experience in Switzerland or France. I couldn't agree more, since I, too, have enjoyed Fondue in both those locales. 

However, as far as this local interpretation of a cuisine 9000+ miles away.

I believe that they've done a marvelous job of creating a fabulous representation. 

Without the long TSA lines, and an even longer plane flight that detracts from this moment's experience.

Certainly the moment, and the meal that we both experienced, were unequivocally unforgettable."}
{"text":"Late night, post graduation celebration. The physical restaurant seems rundown and outdated. Short staffed as we had to wait quite awhile between courses. I think it's over priced for the amount of food that is served. We did two cheese dishes and for 6 people had a small wooden platter with small amounts of bread, vegetables and apples. We had to keep asking for additional food, then it would take awhile for waiter to bring out more. 2nd ended with chocolates and same scenario. Took over 1 1/2 to eat and pay, seemed very slow! Just very chintzy!Glad I tried it but not sure I'd go back."}
{"text":"A niche dining experience that is essentially met for people who actually like one another.  You're sharing boiling pots of cheese and chocolate while \"cooking\" for one another.  This isn't a spot where you're on your phone.  They literally have private seating options with curtains where you can get all sorts of weird with one another.  If you're a miserable failed abortion that probably ate their sibling in the womb as the first step in their quest to become the most obnoxiously gluttonous racist in all the land, then your name is probably Todd \"El Jefe\" H - and El Jefe probably should have just asked for a table.  We all get it man.  Your gargantuan self couldn't fit in the booths.  It's ok.  We know that your real issue with the curtains constantly being closed is that marbled leg of yours poking out the side leaving an awkward, curtained, bump in the walkway.  There are handicapped tables for a reason!  I'm sure your server would have gladly accommodated you, had you not already come in with the mindset that they were white trash and mentally retarded.  You big sweetie, you.

Sorry, I got off track.  The bacon and gorgonzola fondue is my jam.  My girlfriend went for the Wisconsin trio - also, amazing.  Are the salads simple?  Sure.  You didn't come for salads though.  With that being said, the peppercorn ranch on the house salad keeps you wanting to take another bite and the pine nuts in the caeser offer a nice balance and texture to the traditionally saltiness of a caeser dressing.  It's those small little details that can make a simple salad do the trick.

Not speaking of small, how big do we think Todd actually is?  Guy always comes back to either talking about prime rib at Maestros, or Jack In The Box.  I feel like he's the person that keeps the staff on for an extra three hours while he gorges for the winter/spring/summer/fall and picks up his greasy water glass with those ham fists, shaking it in the air and getting bits of sauce all over the clean place settings within a ten foot radius.  He's not even drinking that water!  He just keeps dabbing it on his forehead to bring momentary relief for the meat sweats.  He's probably one legit fart-gone-wrong away from blowing out the side of his gut and winding up in the ER with a qualified minority doctor.  That will of course, give him an aneurysm.  Poor Todd.  Poor sweet, sweaty Todd.

Did I mention that the service here isn't bad?  They tend to be pretty understanding with questions (was my first time, and I'm one of those inner city youth that sucked at third grade ala \"El Jefe's\" review) and were always pleasant from the host stand, to service, to management who knocked to check in on us.  I appreciate it anytime staff are quick to give recommendations on drinks as well.  I trust a server that can appreciate a fine cocktail.  I had the \"Captain n' Coke,\" sans the lime.

GO, GO, GO to The Melting Pot.  It's fun for what it is.  And what it is, is an interactive dining experience meant for conversation, savory bites, and the occasional behind the curtain hand job if you're feeling frisky.  Kidding.  Cum for the food and drinks.

AVOID, AVOID, AVOID any reviews from \"El Jefe.\"  Some people just like to complain to distract themselves from, well, themselves.  SAD."}

{"text":"The Melting Pot does not serve gourmet food but you will pay gourmet prices. There profit margins must be pretty high here but in all honesty this is a wonderful place for a relaxing, more upscale restaurant. If you are looking for a perfect date restaurant this is it.

Lots of booths and a fireplace make the meal. They have private booths with curtains that shut out the outside world but they are super crammed. I'm claustrophobic and hated it. However, if you want to get super cozy go for it...

Reservations are strongly encouraged even when it's slow -- I think it's just how they roll. I've never had a problem getting a reservation during normal times to go. Stay away from this place on Valentine's Day. It will be packed (not romantic) and cost you a fortune. Spend that money on TRUE gourmet food.

Great wine selection with an expert to help you pick out what you want.

Why is the food bad? Well it's not bad. The cheese fondues and desserts are AMAZING. But the entrees are really pricey ($30 per person) and it's nothing special. They just bring you out the raw steak, chicken, or shrimp. Part of the reason you pay so much money for steak at higher end restaurants is the expert seasoning and grilling of the chef. 

Also, I really dislike their dinnerware: cheap, scratched plastic plates -- feels like camping gear. For that reason it's not five stars and really not worth the price. I go here because I accept the Melting Pot's faults and cannot escape cravings for their delicious cheese fondue, scrumptious desserts, and lovely atmosphere. 

Service is always amazing.

It's not really a good restaurant for kids. The can burn themselves on the fondue plate which is on the center of the table and it's really quiet in here so please only bring your kids if they are typically quiet at dinner."}
{"text":"We have been here for dinner in the past. First time you came for just dessert. It was a perfect way to end a perfect day. Service was fabulous, seated right away. We will be doing this again."}
{"text":"I've been to all other locations and decided to try this one, have always had a great experience at the others. Came to the Scottsdale location and ordered the 4 course for myself and my husband only ordered the entree section because he does not like the cheese or chocolate. When it came time for desert I asked if I could get more dippers because they say \"endless dippers\" and was told NO because my husband did not do the 4 course and didn't get the chocolate. So I was unable to get more dippers, which does not make sense because what I ordered came with endless dippers. It does not make sense for us to pay an extra $10 for my husband to get chocolate if he doesn't like it just so I would be able to get endless dippers like the menu says. I have NEVER been told this at the other locations I've always got what I paid for."}
{"text":"Always amazing. I would recommend not having eaten for a few days before coming here because it fills you up to the brim. Staff is always amazing.. wish I had this type of treatment at home!"}
{"text":"UPDATED: I know its a bit late! I wanted to leave the original review for reference, but I had to update my review after my current experience. I have changed my review from 2 to 5 stars. As soon as I put the review up on Yelp, the next day one of the managers reached out to me and made an EXCELLENT effort to find out what ways she could talk with her staff to make sure this doesn't happen again. She asked me to give them another chance and to make our new reservations through her. I find it to be a rare occasion when someone takes the time to actually read their reviews and address the problems at hand. She assured me that my experience was not the norm and with her kind of follow-up, I'm inclined to believe her. Thank you for your efforts and I hope to make it back soon when I'm not traveling so much for work. 



ORIGINAL: Made reservations and still waited 15 minutes in the lobby awkwardly as no one was paying attention to us. This was my first time at the melting pot so I had no idea what to expect but after waiting and finally being seated we sat at the table for another 15 minutes before the waitress showed up and awkwardly/reluctantly introduced herself. Anyways, we got the new cheese fondue thing they had, and the coppa bean something rather. Not my favorite fondue or broth but the filet mignon was delicious regardless as was the ahi tuna.  All in all, I hope I will never have to go back, It just isn't my cup of tea apparently."}
{"text":"I went to have dinner with my family and they told us it was a one hour wait.......the wait was because they did not have servers!
What restaurant does not have servers? It does not make sense!
Terrible experience, terrible service.....keep melting your clients away! 
We are on vacations and wanted to try something new......so are now eating a the restaurant next door...many great servers available!"}
{"text":"I've been to the melting pot in chandler, az a few times and tried out scottsdale for dessert - while the chocolate was good, our server (Joe) refused to refill our dippers even though the last time my husband and I went there, we got a refill on the dippers and once whenI went just for dessert, I got a refill on dippers as well. Basically not the best customer service, will probably stick to chandler and not go back to the scottsdale location!"}
{"text":"I took my husband here for the first time for his birthday. He loves interactive meals like this. I knew going in this place was expensive but after spending $150 for just the two of us and comparing the price to the quality of the food I was little disappointed. I felt that the quality of the food could have been better. The fondue sauces were excellent and the cut of meat were good I think it was the veggies and fruit desserts that I was most unhappy about. Also the cocktails were just OK. I think we may have been happier at grassroots a couple places down."}
{"text":"So much fun!! this place is different and the customer service is amazing. If you go ask for logan as your waiter . He is so charismatic and friendly. We had such a great time!! LOGAN YOU ROCK!!!!"}
{"text":"Automatic 20% gratuity, even increasing the credit card charge after the customer leaves.  
Is this true?
http://www.yelp.com/topic/scottsdale-automatic-20-gratuity-are-we-legally-obliged-to-pay-it-if-its-not-noted-on-the-menu"}
{"text":"This is a great place to meet up with friends to enjoy some cocktails and fondue. In fact it is the ONLY establishment I know of that offers a full menu of nothing BUT fondue! 

The menu boasts a wide variety of options for starters, main courses and deserts.  EVERYTHING is delicious. I always choose broth over oil to cook my main course in but I've done it both ways and they are equally good. 

The Melting Pot requires at least two hours of your time AND is definitely on the pricey side so bring your Benjamin's and let loose! You are in for a really fun, interactive experience!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and had great service and good food each time. It is a little pricey but the experience is fun and entertaining. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We've been to a couple MPs and this was not near the same experience as we have had in the past. The table was still dirty from the previous couple, the pot still had food on it from a previous cook, the veggies were not fresh and had some brown on them, my lime wedge in my drink had a rotten spot on it. It's like there was absolutely no effort put forth to make it the dining experience you go for....or that you pay for. Also our waiter was fairly new and just kept making excuses instead of trying his best. He should have maybe gotten a couple more days of training before hitting the prime time. I feel bad for my wife as she picked it for our anniversary. We will just go to a nice steakhouse next time."}
{"text":"I love the Melting Pot.  Its not somewhere I'd go daily or anything but once in a relationship (or once every 6 months to a year, whichever comes first) I do enjoy being taken there.  

I like going to the Melting Pot on a date as opposed to with a group because its much more intimate to feed just one person a chocolate dipped strawberry than it is to try to feed 10.  Sticks cross and that can just be uncomfortable.  

Make reservations always as it tends to get busy, as request a private table where you are separated from the rest of the restaurant by a curtain for a more intimate vibe.  No one needs to see what you're doing back there with cheese and marshmallows (not in the same course) and whatnot.  

I like the fondue for two, which includes 3 courses and a salad I believe, but come hungry because its a ton of food.  The wine selection is good and drinks are typically pretty strong.  Prices are higher than other places but for the ambiance and uniqueness of the food, and the quality of service, etc, I think its just about right for a special night out."}
{"text":"Great place! I took my boyfriend for his birthday and upgraded to a private booth. We enjoyed a 2 hour dinner for about $300, It was great and so worth it!!!"}
{"text":"I went to The Melting Pot for the first time a couple weeks ago on a double date. Ambiance was wonderful and dessert fondue was absolutely amazing. The only reason I gave it 4/5 is because the expense- although I do not mind paying for good food, I do not like the attitude that sometimes go with high-class places. At one point, I felt as though I was not spoken to in an adult-like way despite us all being above legal drinking age. Perhaps it was because we look the part of 'college kids'. Overall, I'm willing to try again- it may have just been a bad night for that particular waitress."}
{"text":"This was my first time at the Melting Pot for dinner, I have gone before for dessert and drinks at another location. We weren't able to get a reservation until 8:30 which was ok, but then we weren't seated until close to 9:00. They were offering a special, $30 for 3 courses. The first course, the cheese was really good. Then came our entree course. Our burner was going out which wasn't an issue during the cheese. But our meats and vegetables were taking close to 10 minutes to cook, when it should take 2-3. Our waitress was aware that it was taking longer and suggested that we move, but if anyone has been there, you know it's not that simple. The dessert was next and honestly it's the only reason I would go back. Based on my first full meal experience, I will not be returning to a Melting Pot."}
{"text":"Oh no, I do not remember the name of our server.
The Melting Pot no longer has the charity option and although they have something similar, in my opinion it is not as good and it is more expensive.

So, I was a little disappointed.
However, the experience was still fun, and our server was very good.

These are some of the differences I noticed:
The price for the 4 course option is $55ish per person. But now if you want to make it unlimited entree it is $5 more per person. 
Then, it seems better because it now includes some cold cuts on the cheese fondue course, now you can choose any of the salads, and now you can choose oil, grill or broth for the main entree (before it was just broth) plus extra charges for flavored broths.
So, it seemed like a fair deal. Until I realized the new option did not include filet and shrimp : (

To add to my disappointment, I chose a salad that had bacon in the name, and there was no bacon in the salad, lol. It was supposed to be bacon something dressing, but for the life of me I did not taste anything bacon related. You do not do this to a bacon fan, you just don't."}
{"text":"Definitely a place everyone should give a whirl!  This was my first ever full meal of fondues. I have had fondue as a starter at other restaurants, but never cooked my own main course this way.  I had purchased a Living Social deal a couple months back because my bf is a big-time fondue fan and it was a good deal.  We started with the cheddar-beer cheese fondue, which the bf and I both enjoyed. It was fun to see the fondue come together before your eyes as they make it at your table. After devouring the cheese, we had ceasar salads; loved those parmesan crusted pine nuts!!  Now we move on to the main course of cooking our meats and veggies.... We chose a coq au vin broth, which is veggie broth with herbs, garlic and burgundy wine.  We had chicken, steak, pork, shrimp and assorted veggies... They will bring you food until you are stuffed or get sick of cooking! My fave meat was the pork. Not sure what they marinate in, but it is so tender and tasty!  
While it is nice to have a coursed-meal spread out over time, it can be a testament to your patience if you are hungry.  ;)  Our server was great and friendly. A manager came around and made sure we knew about the 'Free fondue for life' event going this year.  All in all, good food, good service, nice night out!
We plan to go back for just chocolate and wine next time!!"}
{"text":"We had chad as a waiter and he TOTALLY made the experience . He was funny , knowledgable and very professional . He listened to our likes and was able to guide us in the right direction as far as choosing sauces. The food was phenomenal ! I would HIGHLY recommended melting pot Scottsdale !"}
{"text":"Decided to use our Groupon one night and go here (celebrating my birthday and it was on a Tuesday). The service is always great and the food was good. Our Groupon was dinner for two (salad course and two entrees)...instead of the salad course we opted for a cheese course to start (I mean how can you not get a cheese course). We just choose a cheese course for one (as that was enough to share) and then we picked filet and teriyaki steak for a main dish and the cooking broth. We also each had a cocktail. Our bill would have been $100 but with the Groupon and also buying the cheese course and the drinks it came to $30 (Groupon was $25) so we spent a total of $55. Not a bad deal at all. Again, service was great as well! I know we will certainly do that again."}
{"text":"Very romantic experience that everyone should experience at least once in their lifetime. Interactive meal seeing as you're the chef. The meal starts with your choice of cheese fondu follows by several meat options to be cooked in oil and wine. The meal is finished with a dessert fondu. We shared the flaming turtle for dessert (which they serve on fire) and it was quite enjoyable. Plethora of choices for each course. Tables are low lit and enclosed by a curtain for ultimate privacy."}
{"text":"If you are not a fan of fondue, you may not enjoy this place. If you are, you have already probably been there. But, in case you haven't, you should definitely go. My wife and I have been fortunate enough to leave in three cities that have them close by. We often go and only get the Wisconsin Cheese Trio and the Peanut Butter Chocolate fondue because that will pretty much do the trick! 

But we did get a full course a couple of times and were not disappointed! The experience itself is pretty neat! The seating is as private as you want it too with a pull curtain for your booth and everything... very romantic. You get a quick course on how to dip and eat your food and the server is always nearby for anything you need. 

For a full course and a bottle of wine you can get out of there just under $100 which, I feel, is well worth it. WONDERFUL!"}
{"text":"There are many great restaurants in the area, many of which have a unique spin or experience tied to them.  None of them match the excitement and uniqueness in my personal opinion than a visit to The Melting Pot for an evening of fondue fun for a special occasion or a happy hour!  

I wanted to do something special for my girlfriend and though I know The Melting Pot is a chain restaurant, I knew that a special evening of fondue at a slow pace in a romantic environment would be perfect, and it was.  They have several rooms with booths throughout though my favorite is the Lover's Lane, which are private rooms with only two seats side-by-side.  

We both went for the four-course meal where we both started with a cheese fondue dish (class alpine) followed by salads (both of us ordered the house salad).  We then had a \"create your own\" entree (pick three meats) where I chose teriyaki-marinated sirloin, premium filet mignon, and herb-crusted chicken.  My girlfriend ordered herb-crated chicken, all-natural chicken, and Atlantic salmon filet.  Finally, we wrapped up with a Yin & Yang (half dark chocolate and half white chocolate).  Every dish was delicious and filling!  Though we dipped items into the cheese and chocolate and dipped the meats into the seasoned court bouillon, our server Jason was very attentive to us and continued to give us advice and pointers.  The food, ambiance, and customer service were amazing!!  The only negative is that the price is quite hefty though the following two paragraphs will highlight a few ways to make the most bang for your buck.

The Melting Pot hosts special events regularly and a bargain-priced happy hour.  Check this link for special deals (https://www.meltingpot.com/scottsdale-az/melting-pot-events.aspx) from Wednesday Wine-Down (every Wednesday), Ladies Night Out (1st Tuesday of month), and special graduation deal where grads eat free during the month of June.  The Sip & Dip Happy Hour includes signature Sip & Dip cocktails ($5.95), select wines ($4.95/5 oz or $7.95/8 oz), $1 off any AZ craft beer, and my personal favorites:  chocolate fondue ($4.95), cheese fondue ($4.95), and salad ($2.95).  If you don't need the main dish, go for ALL-DAY happy hour in the bar area 7 days per week.

Finally, there are some great discounts available.  Check in on Yelp for a free dessert with purchase of 2 courses.  You can use the Entertainment Book for one of four different deals (25% off 4 course dinner with purchase of a 2nd on Friday or Saturday, 50% off 4 course dinner with purchase of a 2nd Sunday through Thursday, 4 course meal with endless entree for $36.95 per person, or 20-30% off a large party depending on day of week).  Next, you can purchase a $75 gift certificate at One Sweet Deal AZ (http://onesweetdealaz.com) for only $50 good through 11/1/17.  You can also write a review after visiting and receive a $25 Dip Card from your server.  Moral of the story...you don't have to pay a fortune to enjoy an amazing meal at a restaurant like The Melting Pot."}
{"text":"The Melting Pot is priced like a Ruth Chris or Del Frisco Steakhouses. You expect quality and higher service standards, but not the case. 
We arrived on time for our reservation and yet had to wait an additional 10 minutes even though  the restaurant was nearly empty, a family who arrived 10 minutes before their reservation told us they waited 15 minutes and then they were seated at a table right by the door. The manager on duty was seriously clueless. 
The food was good but dinner & drinks for two $205. The restaurant was understaffed and I can't say we will be back. 
We love the Melting Pot in Fort Collins! But Scottsdale your patrons cook their own food you could at least try to make their experience memorable and enjoyable."}
{"text":"Horrible place to bring a group. If EVERYONE including a 4 and 6 year old doesn't order off the buffet style no one can order it. Food average at best, save the money and go to Roka Akor."}
{"text":"Ever since I heard about the concept of the Melting Pot years ago I have been wanting to try it. My first real fondue experience (besides at my kitchen table) was last year in Washington DC at a great place called 'Bread and Chocolate' (try it next time you are in the DC area!). The second time I was lucky enough to try fondue was in NYC at an amazing French place called Artisanal Fromagerie and Bistro (another MUST TRY when you are in NYC). The third and most recent was at The Melting Pot and to be honest, I was not nearly as impressed as I thought I would be. Actually, it was kind of a buzz kill!! 

I know that The Melting Pot is a chain, but really do the servers have to so obviously say the same spiel to every table? I mean, I think I heard the same jokes and everything from every waiter. It sort of reminded me of being at a theme park for food. 

Don't get me wrong, the cheese fondue and the chocolate fondue were great but I was not impressed by the salad or the meat courses.   If I return I think I would just enjoy drinks, a little cheese fondue and of course the chocolate."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for my birthday a couple of weeks ago, and it was delicious! I've never done a fondue restaurant and wasn't sure I would like it, but I really did. We had the four-course dinner and got the fiesta cheese, the classic entree meats with mojo dipping stuff and then the chocolate turtle sauce for dessert. I would definitely recommend each of them! :) Our waiter was also very nice and accommodating, as soon as we were done with one course they'd come to clear the table and get started on the next one right away. I would for sure like to come back here again!"}
{"text":"What is up people?  The Melting Pot is THE place to go and escape from reality.  Wifey loves to go and duck into their cozy private booths :).  Why is everyone griping about prices?  They have BOTTOMLESS fondue for $36.95 per person.  That is 4 courses.  I don't think you can get 4 courses at Chili's for that cheap.  Delicious cheese, fresh salad, cook your own food in a pot entree (Can't blame the chef for anything).  Then the best course......chocolate.  Warm, luscious, decadent, wife pleasing.  

We just ate their for our 15th anniversary (yes...she is now eligible for Sainthood) and enjoyed this meal.  I don't know if these other reviewers actually listened to their server for cooking instructions (the food is raw...you cook it) but all my items were delicious.  As for refills...looked the same as what I originally got but on a smaller plate?  Oh and we had refills, believe me we took advantage of that.

This is the place to go and spend time with your better half and relax............

How does the Visa commercial go?  Oh yeah...2 four course dinners, 4 glasses of wine, tax and tip $135.  Reward when you get home....priceless!"}
{"text":"Excellent service by Anthony made our visit very enjoyable. Such a fun night out! Highly recommend The Melting Pot for a unique and sensational dinning experience!"}
{"text":"You're paying a premium price to cook your own dinner?  What a racket.

Why not have the patrons wash and put away their own dishes as well?

I've been here once and never again."}
{"text":"I thought, it was a fun place. I enjoyed our time there and the food. The dipping dessert do-dad was bomb!! Cool place for a intimate dinner date for two. Different-fun way to inter-act and eat dinner together and spend sum quality time together. The food is good too!! I enjoyed our time there and dinner as well. I would go back again. The service was very good as well."}
{"text":"This intimate interactive restaurant is definitely one for special occasions. If you're going with your significant other, I suggest calling ahead and booking a private booth. This is a four-course restaurant but the two highlighted sections are the main course and desert. You get to pick your broth and meats, it also comes with vegetables. Your server will go over the cook times and the many sauces that come with it, from classic teriyaki to a spicy curry. This is the one place you want to tell the server YES to desert. Chocolate fondue....how can you go wrong there. It comes with dippers, fruits, cakes, and marshmallows covered in different flavors. Definitely a thumbs up for a special date night."}
{"text":"Love the melting pot! Have been a few times and it's just as great every time. It's the perfect restaurant for a romantic night out. Yes, it is pricey but it's so unique and taste great that it's worth it! Two people is about $200, but the food is delicious and we get three courses & drinks. The servers have all been amazing and it's always clean."}
{"text":"Went here for our 10th anniversary. We've been before so we knew what to expect. I am happy to see that the menu is more a la carte than it used to be so you can skip courses to trim the costs a bit, or go all out and do the endless fondue. We came with a Groupon and they were great about it. I wasn't in love with the swiss cheese fondue that we had for an appetizer, but hubby liked it so it was probably just me. All of the other courses were great, and the serving sizes were reasonable (aka I was stuffed). We split a single dessert between the two of us and it was a perfect end to the meal. Service was a bit on the slow side (and it wasn't crowded), but this is not the place to go if you want a quick meal, so it wasn't a huge deal. I like to have a leisurely dinner and enjoy myself."}
{"text":"One of our fav date night stops. We get cheese fondue, white chocolate martinis and chocolate fondue. Tonight we were there for cheese and one drink only. We sat at the bar, and The bartender was great. He made us white chocolate martinis even though they were not on the drink menu. He also gave us drinks and fondue at happy hour prices. Wow, we didn't even realize that there was happy hour pricing so that was a great surprise for us and then an extra large tip for him."}
{"text":"Mmmmm.  Melting Pot.   Fondue.  Dipping stuff in cheese and chocolate.  Fun!

Went here for my birthday.  Cozy, romantic atmosphere.  Knowledgeable servers and attentive staff in general.  Clean.  

If you love cheese and dipping unlimited amounts of stuff in it, then this place is for you.  

Ordered the swiss cheese dip to share with my two friends who joined me.  We made a meal out of it by also getting salads.  We're more of a budget-conscious crowd and this place can get pricey quick -  so we tried to be a little careful.  You paid for the dip, but got unlimited amounts of bread, green apples and veggies for dippin'.

Huge selection of alcohol.  Many of these drink choices were expensive, but I got the blackberry margarita ( I think that is what it was called) for $8 and it was enough to wash down my meal.  

For dessert, we got a smores type selection with chocolate/graham dip with  marshmallows, cheesecake, graham crackers, and strawberries for dipping.

All and all, we were very satisfied...and quite full because we kept getting refills on the bread dippers for the cheese.

One of my friends couldn't stop staring at the fireplace, which is one of those modern deals where the fire looks like it's moving in a circle or something.  She kept mentioning how cool it was and how she couldn't stop staring at it.  LOL.

There are two main reasons why this place doesn't get five stars (but four is still pretty damn good).  One being price.  The other being overall food selection.  The menu itself wasn't very diverse, or at least nowhere near as diverse as the alcohol selection.  There were a lot of shellfish type items and some of us are allergic to that stuff.  I was tempted to get some steak dippers, but the price would have really skyrocketed there for us.  

The Melting Pot is perfect for special occasions or a fancy meal from that hot date.  Their hours are limited, so it's easier to make reservations online.  You could easily lose track of time there and hang out for hours getting refills on dippers and drinks.  Good times!"}
{"text":"reserved a private booth and didnt get it even though it was very slow 
i just didnt care for the place at all 
the waitress was very nice dessert was the best i would go for dessert but thats about it"}
{"text":"Other than the cockroach that ran across the top of our table during the meal and the stale bread that was hard enough to cut the top of our mouths our meal was nice."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came for our anniversary and we really enjoyed the food and the service was great!   We're looking forward to our chocolate fondue. We'll definitely be coming back.  The private booth added a nice touch."}
{"text":"The Melting Pot probably deserves 3.5 stars, but I'm hoping my next visit will bump it up to 4. 

It is definitely hard not to like this place. Matt T. said it well that this is a \"dining experience\". I've had meals here that have taken hours, but it's also quite nice to stop in for just cheese and chocolate. (They have a Mon.-Fri. happy hour here where you can get cheese and chocolate courses for $5 each...but you have to sit at the bar.)

I am the person who is obsessed with cheese and I think almost everything tastes better with cheese somewhere in the mix, so I always look forward to the cheese course.. I am proud to say that one thing I can actually make at home is my own cheese fondue. It's not cheap to eat at The Melting Pot, but it's not cheap to make on your own either. The one difference is that I think mine tastes slightly better (maybe I'm just partial). The flavor is interesting, but always seems to be missing something. Worth $16? Probably, but certainly doesn't blow me away.

The dessert is a bit more impressive. A variety of sweets dipped in rich chocolate is always delicious. The Melting Pot provides strawberries, brownies, banana, marshmallow, cheesecake, pound cake, and Rice Krispies Treats to dip into your choice of chocolate. It is heavenly! However, I wish they also offered pineapple. 

Eating the full four course meal here is definitely pricey, but I like that you can cut corners and find ways to make it cheaper. The service is usually quite good, but recently I found that mine was just okay. The managers often make their way around to check on tables which is nice. The atmosphere is most definitely dark and romantic. My boyfriend and I were once given a private booth (with a drawn curtain) which was really nice, but also kind of weird. Our server had to knock before she opened the curtain every time....what are they suggesting goes on in those booths? Apparently it's The Melting Pot/Peep Show. 

I always get excited when making a reservation to visit, but I usually leave feeling stuffed, but slightly underwhelmed."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong - or leave completely stuffed - at the Melting Pot.

I was excited for the Living Social deal a couple months ago for 3 courses (cheese, salad, endless entree) plus a champagne toast for a fraction of the cost. This particular location has a ton of \"Lover's Lane\" seating - a tiny table for 2 with the option to close curtains for privacy. 

I've never had even remotely average service - it's always been top-notch. The food is obviously incredible as well. I love how dinner takes 2 hours here because 4 courses sure is a lot of food. 

Great date spot!"}
{"text":"Gross!! This place is really bad. We had moldy bread served to us and we complained and they brought \"new\" bread which also had mold on it. We complained again and they comped our meal  and water and away we went. We didn't even get to the meats and seafood. I'm not sure what is going on here but this place just looked tired and worn out. The vegetables were old and tasted bad. Nothing seemed fresh. I felt a little sick after leaving here. I will never go here again. It's just a dirty place with bad food and that's just wrong. If you want to serve the public at least serve fresh food."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. It is a little pricy, so it isn't an every week kind of place. But for special occasions, it is great. We celebrated my birthday with wine, green chile cheese fondue, lobster, steak and classic chocolate peanut butter. At first it didn't seem like a lot of food, but we left stuffed. It is an experience and fun to watch your food cook at your table."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I just ate here for our one year anniversary. We got a private booth that has a privacy curtain so our table is completely secluded from the restaurant. Very romantic. You have a choice of up to 4 courses and we chose 3. The first is a cheese fondue with about 6 different options of cheese combinations. You can dip several breads and veggies. The second is salad, which we skipped. The third is entree and there are many delicious meat and seafood options with several fondue broth options. Desert was the last and so damn good! Many options from cheese cake to Oreo covered marshmallows.

If you haven't had a chance to eat here I definitely recommend it! Very friendly and knowledgable staff. Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"I do believe that the customer is always right. I don't abuse that privilege. However, if I take time out of my day to personally report discrepancy in my billing, I believe the management should be considerate and do what he can to make sure that he earns my repeat business by offering an apology, and doing whatever is within his power to correct any mistakes or promise to (and follow through with) report(ing) back to me when he uncovers the cause of said discrepancy. None of this took place, of course. The management did not apologize, did not follow through, and offered no means of reconciliation when one of his staff allegedly applied her own (additional) tip to our bill. Our server even went so far as to suggest how much we should tip her, prior to our credit card signature, which is very unprofessional since a tip is a customer's option not a server's entitlement. We will not be returning to this business. Pay in cash if you do plan a visit to this location."}
{"text":"The service and food was wonderful with one exception.  When we walked in on this last Sunday night and stated that we had a reservation, our hostess was about to seat us when another couple walked in and she dropped us to assist them and brought them to the dining room.  Then she tried to place us in a private booth with curtains.  So Im not sure if she thought my friend and I were a couple.  She made it apparent who she thought deserved priority without explanation.  At that point my friend, another male told her we needed to be seated elsewhere and it was not \"date night\"  and she found us a different area.  Bad first impression.  Once upon being seated however, everything was as smooth as could be, drinks were great, food was great and service was wonderful.  I'm glad the waitress over came the bad first impression the hostess created when we first got there."}
{"text":"Food is delicious but WAY overpriced.  Don't get me wrong, I would still recommend it for a special but very rare occasion.

The highlight of the evening was the dessert (flaming turtle with dark chocolate)- it was like an orgasm for your tongue.  We'll probably go back for a romantic after-dinner dessert sometime, or just stick to their happy hour cheese and chocolate special.  That's pretty much the only way to get out for under $100.   But I will say, the experience is worth the occasional splurge.

I took off one star for price, and another because they keep their happy hour under wraps.  It's not advertised, servers and host don't mention it, and you have to ask to be seated at the bar in order to get it.  But if you walk in and tell them that's what you're after, it's a much better deal.  ($5 per person cheese $5 per person dessert).  Very intimate.  Nice way to spend an evening.  Provided your pockets are lined with $100 bills of course."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to The Melting Pot this past Saturday night and the experience was HORRIBLE.  It was 9:30 when we showed up and when we walked in we were greeted with a rude hostess.  She did not greet us but instead asked \"What can I do for you?\" with attitude.  Well, it's a restaurant, so I guess I was there to get my haircut!  When I responded a table for 2 she asked, again with attitude, if I had a reservation.  The restaurant was not even half full.  I said no, she then asked \"well are you having a full course meal?\" and I responded \"Just dessert\".  After waiting a about 3 minutes, we were finally sat.

The horrible experience did not end there.  It took TEN minutes before our waitress even came to our table.  They  had a full waitstaff that just kept walking by our table staring at us.  When our waitress finally did come, she was also rude and offered no pleasantries.  We order the Original for 2 and our drinks.  Everything was then served together.  I must say the chocolate fondue was delicious.  However, our waitress NEVER came back to check on us or refill our drinks or how our drinks and food were (For the record, the Cafe Mocha was ice cold).  And with heavy food like that, water is a must!  When we were done, she finally came over after I flagged her down, then asked if we wanted refills.  I said yes and the check.  Once I paid, she brought back my card and just left the checkbook on the table.  No \"Thank you have a nice evening, Thank your for coming in\", nothing.  

We were very excited about having a fantastic dessert but the rude staff there ruined the entire experience.  We will not be going back to the Scottsdale location."}
{"text":"Not really what i expected it to be.. The only thing both me nd my fiancée enjoyed was the appetizer and the dezzert.. The entree was basically a boiled entree witch u gotta do yourself.. Totally not worth 40 bucks a plate or so called \"entree\"
Im rating 2 stars cause of the dezzert.."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the most overpriced restaurants I've ever been to.  Food was just OK, not great.  Bill worked out to be about $70/person including one beer each. There are too many other good places to eat for me to ever consider going back."}
{"text":"Went here tonight for my bf's birthday dinner. Made reservations, but had to wait a good 5 minutes in the lobby to be seated. Totally fine.
Was seated....waited for menus...finally our waitress shows up and awkwardly announces that a second server would be shadowing her all night. Cool. At first we figured she was training her shadow, but we quickly realized it was her shadow who was observing her, as a new hire. Also, totally fine.

I really hate to say this and it takes a lot for me to complain about service, but it was pretty horrendous. There was not once a crack of a smile from our waitress, and her questions and instructions were super short, unfriendly, and awkward, for lack of a better word.  I think she must have been nervous, to be being shadowed by someone obviously observing her every move and word. I would be, too! But geez - there was very little effort on her part.

When you are paying this much for a dinner, you really expect top notch service, so this was disappointing for sure.  

Love the food (duh), atmosphere, and idea of the place. We had a great time, and will try again, hoping for some better service next time."}
{"text":"First time to a Fondue Restaurant definitely a unique experience. Definitely more of a date place than family outing. The staff was very helpful guiding my friend and I on what to order. Definitely will go again but probably with a date not to hang out with a friend from out of town."}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday night for the first time and WOW! We had a private booth which I  definitely recommend! For the appetizer we had the Fiesta fondue followed by a house salad and the main entree consisted of Teriyaki-marinated sirloin, filet mignon, chicken breast, shrimp and spinach ravioli. For dessert we had the white chocolate creme brulee and I was blown away by how delicious everything was! What made it even better was our server Hayden, he was very personable and made the dining experience very fun!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. A couple of times with the husband to enjoy a Groupon and a special menu option. And twice for ladies night with the co-workers since they do a special ladies night menu the first Tuesday of every month - which has a good price for all you get!

We almost always call ahead and make reservations - on ladies night, a reservation is a MUST since it fills up quickly.  The staff is always really friendly and they are more than happy to walk you through the process if you are new here.  The drinks are strong and the food comes in stages so you can really make this an great date night.  

I'd be torn to choose between the cheese appetizer and the chocolate dessert for my favorite part of the meal, but since I'm more of a sweet than salty fan, I'll go with the dessert.  They always have special check-in offers and from time to time they offer Groupons, as well.  If you sign up online for their mailing list, you'll get some decent offers there, too!

Overall: A
A great spot for a date night experience, ladies night out, or special dinner for a loved one! Be sure to seek out specials since it can get a touch pricey."}
{"text":"Okay, so I should have had a better idea of what to expect, but I suppose my expectations were too high. I started out with a Cesare salad, which was just an average salad; nothing really special about it. I then got my entree, which consisted of 5 shrimp,  5 duck breast medallions,  5 fillet mignon medalions, and a few pieces of potato, broccoli,  and mushroom. It was a TINY dinner! Like, I've seen kids meals that were bigger than what I received for what would have been $40 if I hadn't had a groupon. Still though, I wouldn't even pay half price again for what I received for my meal. And I didn't even think that my meal was extraordinary! If it had been amazing, then I could see the reasoning for their outrageous prices,  but it's just not worth paying those prices just to have your own cooking pot at your table. The only reason that I'm giving them 2 stars is because the staff were all really nice and attentive."}
{"text":"I had never been to The Melting Pot and was really looking forward to it with a couple of friends. 
We had a 6:30PM reservation and felt rushed the entire time by our server. 
We had just sat down at our table and were deciding on drinks. Our server actually said, \"have a cheese selected by the time I come back\". This pissed me off immediately. First, I have never been there and didn't even know what he was talking about and second, I was still deciding on what I wanted to drink. I asked him \"what happens if I don't have a cheese selected?\"  His reply was \"then I give you more time\" for which I responded with \"that's what I thought\" in the most condescending attitude I could. Don't piss me off you high school punk. 
His attitude became better after that, but then he tried to talk us out of ordering the bourguignonne which is the canola oil cooking style. Dude, that's what we want okay!?  I then overheard our server tell another table that the bourguignonne was his favorite cooking style. WTF?
I had the French Quarter selection which was chicken, beef, shrimp and sausage all seasoned in Cajun spices. It was very good. 
Out server kept coming by to check on this and would tell is that \"we needed to have all out skewers in the pit at once or else this would take all night.\" We just ignored him and did what we pleased. 
Then about half was through our server told us that we needed to select a chocolate. I said \"we aren't even half way done here.\"  In the end we selected the s'mores chocolate and it was very good. 
All in all, food was good but it was not an enjoyable experience. 
I guess our server was in a rush to get out of there? Maybe that's just how The Melting Pot operates? 
Either way, glad I tried it, but I wouldn't go back. I was really turned off by the rushed service."}
{"text":"Okay, so now that I've experienced it myself, I have no idea what the hype is over this weird cook-it-yourself restaurant. I was excited to go and have my anniversary dinner at the location in Scottsdale even tho my husband wanted us to go to Donovan's (hindsight is 20/20 people!) I placed our reservation the day before and requested a private booth, although I was told that they could not promise me one, whatever, I get it, no problem. We get there and our first impression is even before we enter the restaurant...it smells like sewer outside, who wants to smell that just before eating an EXPENSIVE dinner? Red flag #1...I should have turned around right then. As we are being seated, I notice that there are at least 4 available private booths even though I was told by the manager that we would have to wait at least an hour and a half for one...red flag #2 (I do not like being lied to!). We sit at the table waiting for our waitress to come over which took at least 10 minutes, and another 10 just to get our water. We then order the four course meals and I still think it's a novel idea, cooking my own food...ha! The appetizer cheese seriously took at least another 10 to 15 minutes to get to our table and to be honest, it wasn't good...I've had better Artichoke dip at Oregano's...Red flag #3. Then our salads come out, and my initial thoughts are: these look like the salads from Bill Johnson's Big Apple...NOT GOOD! I then find a romaine heart in my salad, so clearly the expediter didn't pay attention when sending out the food. Another red flag...we're up to 4 now...too many for anything good to happen now...so we finish our appetizer and cheese and after at least 15 minutes of the romaine heart sitting on display on top of my plate so she can see it, another random waitress comes to pick up our plates and the fondue pot without saying a word to us...rude! We then have to wait ANOTHER 20 minutes for our waitress to even walk by our table. Meanwhile the table across from us who has 2 more people than us and who was seated after us is already served their entrées. I'm upset at this point. Then our waitress casually walks by and says \"wow, they've already cleaned it off, they're fast....NO YOU'RE JUST SLOW!!! I ask her for a refill of our waters which she says she'll get asap....we waited at least another 10 minutes for her to come by with a pitcher of water...what is she doing for so long?! 20 minutes go by, my husband and I start joking about how we are glad we ate some Jack-in-the-box tacos before coming because we would be starving again if we hadn't since the food is taking FOREVER! And for what? THEY DON'T EVEN COOK THE FOOD FOR YOU, so what's taking so long???!!!!!! I immediately regret my decision of wanting a fun whimsical dinner when the raw meat comes to our table...it's no longer fun, it's disgusting. The cooking liquid we chose, Mojo, is gross...should have gone with the Veggie broth, or better yet, just not eaten here! The waitress told me when we ordered that she could make the broth as garlicky or not garlicky as I wanted, however as she's putting the stuff in the cooking liquid, she just dumps in the cilantro and garlic WITHOUT ASKING IF I WANT MORE OR LESS...UMMM...EXCUSE ME BUT DIDN'T WE GO OVER THIS WITH YOU BEFORE?! I guess I can't be too hard on her, we did have that conversation like an hour ago...So after cooking our own food, we neatly stack all of our plates up and patiently wait another 10 minutes for her to come get them...mind you, she never came by once to ask how we were doing and if we needed anything. We order dessert and yet again, I have to ask for more water because she never seems to notice that our glasses are empty. This time she came to refill our water in a timely manner...however, the dessert (some melted chocolate and pre-cut NOT tasty things to dip in it) took 15 minutes to get to our table and we had to wait another 10 for it to get warm. The little brownie, of which there is only 1 on a serving plate for 2 people, and the other thing...which I think was a chocolate chip cookie or something...we're clearly store bought and the brownie at least was gross (I didn't try the other one...it looked like bad banana bread but didn't smell like anything...), not to mention the strawberries, they clearly had been washed, cut and left in water because they looked pale, we're soft and nearly flavorless...they should know not to leave strawberries in water or they break down immediately...very disappointing seriously, I can do all of this myself, why did I pay over $100 for this poor service and cooked the freaking food myself?! Lesson learned! We will never be back and I do NOT recommend going for anything other than dessert and if you choose to do that, bring your own stuff to dip in it, because they definitely don't give you enough! Overall, a totally disappointing anniversary dinner! We will never be back!"}
{"text":"Went here for a date night with my boyfriend and it was definitely a success. We were greeted promptly and got a seat right away (even though we did make reservations). Our server was amazing. I, unfortunately, forgot her name. She was very knowledgeable and since I was new there she definitely helped me out on what the Melting Pot was all about. The food and drinks came out very promptly and she always had my drinks refilled before it even ran out. She always seem to care about us and if we were unhappy with anything to let her know and she will fix it right away. 
The food was amazingly delicious. This place definitely is great for a cute date night. :)"}
{"text":"Never paid full price before always had some sort of deal. The deals always seemed worth while, full price seems a lot steep for what you get. Yes its a beautiful atmosphere and the staff is nice or nice to a point. 
I love cheese but maybe i don't like cheese fondue I was not thrilled with the taste of the basic chedder version. 
On the other hand the toffee chocolate dessert fondue was exquisite I want to drown in a vat of it.

Main course was right on good quality meats and a good variety on the special I ordered.

The spinach salad was wonderful and delicious but small for the price. 

I would eat the salad and the desert again and skip the rest."}
{"text":"I really did have a hard time decided how many stars to give this place. There was some ups and downs with the whole experience. I'll write this review and you decide how many stars it should have...

Decor: when walking into the restaurant, I will say it looks stunning. The ambiance is very relaxing, romantic. The bar is right next to the entrance, and there's a nice fireplace not far away. It was very welcoming, and I felt like this was going to be an intimate experience.

Food: ok, so this is where the review gets a little muddled. We all got three courses, and the first was the cheese fondue. We decided to get cheddar, and spinach artichoke. When the began making it, the cheese looked like something you'd buy from the store. Kraft shredded cheese to be exact. It had that white hue to it, and looked preserved/processed. The taste wasn't the most pleasant either. Tasted like cheap beer mixed with cheap cheese. For $9 a person, I would've liked something more. It came with stale tasting bread, and some apples.

Then some of us got salads, which totally improved the mood. I got the Cesar salad, which was nice. It had parmesan coated pine nuts, tasted delicious. So, that's a huge plus. 

Main course was interesting. We got the complimentary court bouillon cooking method. There are three others, which cost around $6 a person more, so that wasn't happening since we had a party of 8. It tasted and smelled like those cubed bouillon with some herbs thrown in. The entrees did have a decent portion size, but $20 bucks a plate was pretty steep. 

Dessert was amazing! We got two different chocolates, and they were delicious. It came with strawberries, pound cake, rice crispy treats, marshmallows, the works. That was a nice way to finish the meal.

Service: so, this was hard. The waitress tried hard, but she also was non-existent at times. I had to go find her during the meal so we could get our main courses, and water fills. The restaurant wasn't packed by any means. Which left a sour note in our mouths.

Overall: For the price paid, I feel like we should've received a lot more. Get better cheeses, something that doesn't taste fake. Lower the prices so it's more affordable for middle class patrons. For 8 people the bill was around $300 dollars, which is rough when there was only water, and 2 adult beverages added. So, I'd bring a nice amount of cash or money in the bank before coming."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday in the hopes of reliving some great fondue experiences I had in Switzerland. Since I'm a vegetarian and also wanted \"cheese as a meal\" for my birthday,  my friend and I decided to order two cheese fondues and skip the \"meals\". The cheese selections were great but the dippers were left to desired. The bread was overall a bit stale and crusty. The pretzel bread was good though. The \"veggies\" really left a lot to be desired. A few broccoli, carrots, celery and tomatoes. Really?? A tomato?  Not what I normally associate with fondue.  The waiter (who was awesome by the way!) was kind enough to scrounge up some mushrooms for our next round but it really seems like that should be a staple already. 

We decided to splurge for a dessert round of chocolate fondue. The chocolate was nice but it felt like it could have been thicker. The sweet treats that came with for dipping were nice but I would have preferred more fruit. 

Overall I'd say while the actual cheese fondue was good, the items to dip in it left to be desired. I do hope in the future they consider adding more fruits and veggies to the mix, until then I may just invest in a fondue pot of my own."}
{"text":"Melting Pot was the perfect girl's night out! We had a great experience. Our survey, Hayden, was great at explaining his recommendations for each course and continually checking to ensure we were enjoying ourselves and seeing how else he could assist. The food was delicious and we left so happy and content with our amazing meal."}
{"text":"I hate to be this person but I am still so disappointed about my dinner from last night. It was my boyfriends birthday yesterday and I made dinner reservations for 7:30pm and mentioned that it was my boyfriends birthday so that we could do the whole four courses, since my boyfriend had never been to The Melting Pot. I have always had pleasant experiences at The Melting Pot in northern California but I feel as though at the Scottdale location off of Hayden, they did not care about creating a intimate/exciting experience for their guests. 

We walked in and the host and I am guessing it was the manager for that night, were at the stand. They both looked annoyed and questioned if they could help up, no hello greeting, as if they thought we were going to walk in without a reservation. We are on the younger side, 22 and 26 and I felt extremely judged by the woman and man from the beginning as if we didn't belong. We were escorted to our table and it was the cutest booth with a curtain to hide us (even though our server kept leaving it open). I loved that, but unfortunately they sat us right next to the kitchen door and we could hear the kitchen staff yelling the entire time (seriously yelling). I felt annoyed because all the other booths around us were empty, stayed empty the entire time we were there and when we left around 9:45pm they were still empty. I am not sure why they would sit us so close to the kitchen when there were plenty of open tables. 

I cannot remember our waiters name but he mentioned that he had been working at The Melting Pot for three years, was one of the bartenders, and a manager as well. I have been a server for 5 years myself and I have experience in fine dining restaurants and I sadly have to say our waiter was the reason for my two star review and made it hard for me to give him a fair tip. He had no energy, talked monotoned, and made things feel very awkward. I felt disappointed because I am aware of how you should serve a guest, especially when it is one of the guests first times at the restaurant or their birthday/special occasion. 

The food was GREAT. My boyfriend and I enjoyed ourselves because we refused to allow bad service to ruin the night. I had higher expectations because our server is one of the managers, which might be my fault but the service was terrible and I really don't want this to happen to anyone else!"}
{"text":"Had a LivingSocial that I bought months ago & finally went on Saturday for dinner, the day before it expired. Had a reservation at 8:15 PM, arrived around 8PM and they seated us right away. Our waitress, Ali, was really good and said she had only been working there 2 months. The LivingSocial I got was only $40 and included 2 salads, cheese fondue, 2 entrees, and our waitress included chocolate for us. Amazing deal IMO. We also got a bottle of wine which was $29 & upgraded the cooking style to the Coq Au Vin - which was great, worth the extra $6. Now for my review of the food: 
*Salad - got the Caesar & House salad, both were good, I recommend putting the Garlic & Wine Seasoning on it
*Cheese Fondue - we got the Spinach Artichoke ; it was amazing! I love how fresh it is, you actually watch them put every ingredient into the pot. 
*Individual Entrée Main Course - we got to pick 2 so we got the Filet Mignon & the All Natural Breast of Chicken. The steak was really good & both of our favorites. The chicken was okay, it didn't have much flavor and was a little bland, I kept having to dip it in the different sauces that are given to you. Next time, I would get something besides the chicken. Also, this comes with a bowl of vegetables -- potatoes, broccoli, and mushrooms. I paired them with the green goddess and bleu cheese sauces. YUM!
*Chocolate course - unfortunately I cannot review this because we got it to-go and then left it at the table :( bummer!

Anyways, it was a great meal, something different then a typical date night somewhere else. I would probably be more likely to come back with a LivingSocial or Groupon deal just because it isn't cheap."}
{"text":"The melting pot went above and beyond to make our experience amazing! I received a call from the manager and was told that our waitress had injured her arm that same night so she was in pain. (Completely understandable) he welcomed us back and we went a couple of nights after valentines day. We got a private booth and had a great night. 
Thank you Melting Pot!"}
{"text":"Fun to do the fondue with family, friends or just with your love one. Beautiful romantic setting especially if you just go with your love one and get the private cozy room.

The quality of meat selections were decent, I wish they provide more vegetables. The cheese that they use seems regular cheese, nothing fancy.

The dessert fondue it was OK, I wish they use more healthier sweets to deep in the dark chocolate.

Service was good and the manager event came to our table to check on us couple times, that was nice.

The pricing was a bit to high, but overall it was good but not great!"}
{"text":"Yes, this place can be a bit pricey, however if you catch them at happy hour or on \"girls night out\" it can be very affordable. The atmosphere and the \"specialness\" of the melting pot is unbeatable. I have been there for intimate occasions, and family birthdays. Food is wonder, especially the cheese! The menu has changed a bit over the years, and there are some oldies I would love to see return (the mushroom salad), but there is nothing that beats this place for any special occasion"}
{"text":"The complaints and bad reviews left for this place are a bit over the top. It's really not that expensive for all of the food and service you receive. I saw someone say it's $70 per person per meal, umm.. that's depending on what you choose. A four course meal for me was around $45 and for my boyfriend who chose lobster, it was $54 or something for his four course meal. I was nervous to come here for my birthday and anniversary celebration after reading so many negative reviews but I'm glad I came in anyways. 

I called and scheduled a dinner for two on a Sunday night, requesting one of the private booths with curtains. The ONLY problem all night (which is not really a problem at all because we were still sat and only had to wait maybe 3 minutes - no biggie!) was that my reservation was not made or written down. I double checked to make sure I called the right restaurant and I did, the only thing we missed out on was a rose petal set up (for $15, I'd rather save the money) that I thought was obligatory to get the private booth I wanted. The host / manager seemed a little annoyed when I told her I called the right restaurant, but I may have been coming off wrong, she may have been having a bad night, etc. She came back to check on us later which I appreciated. 

FOOD was amazing! Salad is plain but delicious, my boyfriend loved whatever nuts they added to the Caesar. We had the regular land meat entree and the seafood one with lobster, shrimp, ravioli, etc. and shared them. They were amazing and the veggies that come on the side are so yummy!! Dessert is great too, next time I'll let my boyfriend choose because I chose the basic one and eat peanut butter daily so I didn't need more, but I thought I did! 

Our server was wonderful, he did a great job and checked on us consistently. Timing was always good, we were never waiting nor rushed. Dinner was absolutely amazing, my boyfriends first time and he fell in love too. We can't wait to come back!! 

The prices aren't that bad! Pay attention to where you are dining! If you want the extra special spot, ask for or call to reserve one of the booths with a curtain for two. Don't listen to the people who have left reviews who don't know how to pay attention to what they're doing. I serve at a restaurant and can tell when people are mad their tab comes out high, *pay attention.* 

Thank you, Melting Pot!! We will be back :-)"}
{"text":"For the price you're better off buying a fondue pot and doing this at home... plus it can be much more romantic.  I'm never a big fan of chains, and although this one manages to gain points from the atmosphere standpoint, the prices just don't justify food that any novice can make.  If money is no object and you want someone to serve you, there isn't anything \"bad\" about Melting Pot."}
{"text":"I was really excited to come here. When I went to Switzerland, I absolutely died over the yummy cheese fondue I got to have so I was expecting great things from this famous Melting Pot. However, I'm still really undecided about this place. I thought the food was pretty good. I felt it was overpriced, but hey, it's fondue. What should I expect? The alpine was a pretty good fondue, I will say that. The meat was also quite wonderful. However, the service really kicked me. 

First of all, we got to out reservation on time, but were seated nearly 20 minutes after our arrival. They didn't seem to care about us or the fact that we were waiting. That started us off on the wrong foot.
We just had a really strange waitress that had a dry and sarcastic humor. While I am usually fine and used to this, going on a date out to dinner? She really brought down the mood. It was really awkward... She was, however, attentive, so I do give her that. Just compared to the other servers I was witnessing, I felt like we were getting short changed. We weren't really given in-depth explanations like the table next to us. And there's nothing I dislike more than someone who says they just like everything..

Another thing I have to say is that with the living social deal they offer, you just get salad and then the meat/cooking style. We ended up walking out with about a $50 bill on top of it for the cheese fondue (for 2) and one drink. They also include a 20% gratuity. We felt like after the price of the deal and what we paid on top of that, we could have done the endless fondue and gotten way more food for almost the same price. That really irked me... It's smart because it gets you there and you're tempted to spend, spend, spend, but I won't be doing that again.

Anyways, I may go back in the future and try The Melting Pot again, but I don't believe it will be at this location that I do."}
{"text":"They invited me back. And THe food was fantastic. As well as our server was amazing. Will will try to forget about my previous encounter here and will continue to return."}
{"text":"I'm leaving a negative review but I'm not mad at you Melting Pot.  The service was really professional and nice.

But it was a bit ridiculous. Despite having reservations and the place being half full, it took over 10 minutes to be seated?  Not fun when you have a 10 yr old and a 6 yr old in tow.  They were very well behaved but it's a lot better when we get settled, ya know?

so, on to the food.  It was my daughter's birthday and she loves all things cheese related, so we decided, fondue! perfect.

The classic cheddar fondue had some bad light beer and a lot of garlic.  not sure that was fresh garlic but regardless, it was raw and the fondue pot did not cook it.  The whole cheese fondue had a terribly astringent taste to it as a result.  

My daughter wouldn't even eat it.  Which is crazy if you know her.  She'll eat camembert, gorgonzola, the stinkiest french cheese you can imagine.  I found it hard to eat as well.

I mean, cmon man, how to you mess up melted cheese!!??  Is there a chef who actually tastes the food on occasion or do you just leave it to the servers?  My daughter said:  \"So we're actually paying them and we have to cook our own food?\"  Well, good point, but that is the idea with fondue I guess.

one extra star for the chocolate fondue that they comped for her birthday, that was very cool.  Still the bill was serious.  Not sure I really get the food quality/portion to value ratio.

Anyway, I think that was a one and done thing for us."}
{"text":"This place is right up my ally. It has amazing food, great service, private dining areas for special and romantic occasions, and offers a very interactive experience. We got the 4 course meal for our anniversary, ended up costing me $100 but it was worth the experience and of course...anything for my wife right?! First was our salads, then we got our appetizer which was sharp cheddar cheese fondue dipped with vegetables, potatoes, and a few other delicous foods. Next was our entrée and it came with this amazing fondue broth that our meat or shrimp gets cooked in. We had a bunch of sauces to dip our meat in too...amazing!!! Lastly but definitely not least, was desert. We got the smores fondue and it was amazing. Probably one of the best deserts I've had in a long time. At first glance, I didn't think it was much food, but it's alot and fills you up no question. I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend to use my Groupon. It was our first time and we had wanted to try this place for a while. The hostess seated me in one of their curtained booths and my friend arrived later. I kinda liked it, gave us some privacy and it was a different experience. The hot plate was heating the pot as we waited for our cheddar cheese fondue, which we substituted vegetable broth instead of the beer ingredient. Our server made the fondue in front of us, which was cool to see. It comes with yummy bread, Granny Smith apples, carrots, broccoli, and cauliflower. I expected a creamier consistency, but it was still good. We also ordered their house salad, which was fine. I realize I don't care for cheddar cheese on my salad. It took a while for our salads to come out, which was kinda weird. We were pretty full from the fondue so it wasn't a big deal. It took some time for our server to bring out the dessert menu, and we went with the pure dark chocolate. Delicious!! Best part of our meal. I liked the fruits the best (bananas, pineapples and strawberries). We didn't want marshmallow treats but the communication wasn't conveyed clearly and we still got them. I just didn't want them to waste them since we weren't gonna eat them, but oh well. Overall, a good experience and probably just a one time thing, but maybe I'll be back and try their good earth vegetarian. Staff was plenty nice and made sure we were okay throughout our meal."}
{"text":"Umm.. I might be biased a bit because I actually worked here while at ASU. So I figured I'd give you a few tips for anyone that hasn't been here before.

- Not a place to impress a first date. Listen, you'll be here for at least an hour and a half (for 2 people), hour is you really rush. With LOTS of downtime that could lead to really, really awkward conversation. Go on a first date somewhere else and use this place to \"seal the deal\" guys, you're welcome. 

- Don't be cheap. If you can't afford to go all out, just save up and come back another time. Get the full 4 courses and a good bottle of wine. If you don't know anything about wine, don't be afraid to ask your waiter. Tell them you want to try something first before buying the bottle and they'll bring you sample. Tell them if you only want to under X amount of dollars, too. Don't be afraid to say that you are looking for something under $35, there were plenty of wines that are GOOD for under that price at the Pot. And there are VERY good wines under $50, so know what you want to spend if you don't have an idea already.

- Make reservations. I probably should have put this first, oh well. 

- If it's a special occasion, let them know when you make the reservation. Ask for a private booth if you really want privacy during your meal. But please, don't have sex or get too frisky while in that booth. Yes, it does happen and it makes it kind of awkward for the server. Save it for later, and if you can't help yourself, ask the server to hold up the meal and go back to your car.

- And finally, tip your server well. This is not your typical serving job and there is a lot going on with your meal. Between them cooking it, making sure your safe (guess what? hot oil can be dangerous!) and doing their best to make it special for you - it's only polite. 

I think that's it. enjoy it."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for our one year wedding anniversary. We have been here several times before and I love it. The food is so good and the dessert is the best part. Our server was very friendly, helpful, and gave us everything we needed. We had a great night. I will keep coming back to this place."}
{"text":"It's not that I wouldn't tell people to go here but this is what I would tell you. 1. Do not ever go here with a pregnant woman. We went here for our anniversary and I am 6 months pregnant. They sat us first in a tiny little booth, my belly was already touching the table and I began to get claustrophobic. I have never seen a booth so small in my life. It is a total design error. Private booths yes, not tiny private booths in a cubby in the wall--so uncomfortable. We asked to be moved, which I really felt for a place where we were spending that much money should have probably noticed that I was pregnant and found me the best most comfortable seat in the house--instead they found us a table with torturously hard chairs. Then they told me the big surprise that this is a 2 hour dining experience--a 6 month pregnant woman cannot sit in hard chairs for two hours--again someone should have noticed this and offered a better seating. I tried to brave it, in between the painfully slow out lay of tiny courses--again not fit for a starving pregnant woman--for about 2 hours, finally after several trips to the bathroom just to get the feeling back in my legs my husband had to ask to be moved again to an obviously better spot next to us--an open, normal sized booth with a cushy seat. I liked our waiter, very friendly, and the chocolate fondue at the end of the endless fondue was to die for. I'd go back and specify that I want a normal sized booth and probably just get the cheese fondue and chocolate. The other entrees were okay, but bring me out my food not in a trickle feed. By the end we had spent 3 hours there, had to move twice and I was just exhausted by the end and we paid over $130 for the whole thing. I've been to nicer restaurants and paid as much for more caring service perhaps and amazing food. It was alright, but again there's just a lot to know about the melting pot before you decide to spend three hours there. If you're looking for a romantic time with just some light eating and conversation then that's what this place has to offer, but men before you bring your girl there make sure to request a normal booth, and maybe think about ordering a la carte if you don't want to wait hours for your 4-course meal to be done."}
{"text":"Um, excuse me, I didn't have such a great experience. To start off, my table was very dirty. I ordered what I thought was some good cheese, but it was awful. They give you the smallest containers with bad tasting fruits and vegetables that you could get at your local grocery store for a few cents. The 5 chips they give you are stale and gross. The bread is ok, but they only give you 4 little pieces of it. The portion sizes are tiny, terrible, and tragic. Avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"Went here a few weeks ago. As others have said, you're paying a lot for a gimmick, and the novelty wears off pretty quickly...particularly after you realize you've paid over $100 for you and your date to cook your own food (after a lengthy trial and error process).  The initial cheese fondue was delicious, as was the salad course. And you can't go wrong with chocolate fondue for dessert. But I could've stopped there.  

The entree is where things kind of go off the rails.  You're cooking your own meat (a few pieces each of steak, pork, chicken, shrimp, or lobster) and veggies (broccoli, potatoes, mushrooms), and you don't quite get the perfect timing until well into the meal. The meat itself can be a little bland--you're basically just deep frying it. And while a long, slow meal with your date is romantic, it does get a little tedious to cook each individual bite. Yes, we knew what we were getting into when we went there--a place that's a little unique, but again, that wears off pretty quick.

That said, there's nothing the staff could've done better. They were attentive and helpful, and the small booth (with curtains) was an intimate way to dine out. Still I don't think I'll be back, and if I do, I'll probably skip the entree and just stick with the other elements of the four-course meal."}
{"text":"Very fun !!! Great waiter was so good at explaining the menus to our large group. Definitely plan for it taking a little longer do to the uniqueness of the dinner. It's a little more expensive but a fun treat to have once and awhile."}
{"text":"I don't give 5 stars very often. 

Let me just start by saying that this dining adventure takes a while. Our reservation was at 715 and we left at 930. There are multiple courses and cooking times for your food. (The proteins are all delivered raw and you cook them yourself in the fondue pot.)

As long as your are comfortable with the fact that it is expensive, it takes a while to have the full experience, and that it is interactive (requires you to do your own cooking in the proteins) then you really should not have anything to complain about. As long as you know what you're in for, you'll have an amazing time.

As far as the quality of the food, the staff, the atmosphere and the flavors, I can only say one thing: DYNAMITE. 

I have had more expensive meals in my life. Price does not dictate the quality of a meal. Everything adds up to be the best date night, special occasion, etc that my money can buy. Any time I want a special dining experience The Melting Pot is #1, #2, #3 on my list every single time. I just can't say enough positive things about it. If you think it's too good to be true, go find out for yourself. It's not and you'll thank me later."}
{"text":"We've been here before, but quite some time ago - - and we've been to many other places since then.  Went for a Birthday/Father's Day celebration.  The evening was exactly the treat I was hoping for!  Fun, friendly and attentive staff.  Our sever, Michael gets a special shout out.  Great service from start to finish.  We were 100% pleased with the pacing, quality and presentation of our \"Endless Entree\" meal.  A couple people in our party had some special requests, and the manager was very accommodating.  Didn't get the Manager's name, but he seems like the kind of guy who knows what's going on with every table, and doesn't hesitate to do his part to make sure the staff has what they need and the customers get a high end experience.  Final observation - - this is a format that demands a lot of the staff.  They are well trained and work really hard.  Great job - - we'll be back!"}
{"text":"I'm visiting Scottsdale from the San Francisco bay area and decided to meet up with a friend here for dinner tonight. I LOVE fondue and was looking forward to my dinner here for a while.

First of all, we had an AWESOME server named Nate. He knew the menu very well and was very attentive to our needs. To top it off, he was very handsome too! I appreciated that he was such a great server to us despite the fact that we shared our entree and didn't order much.

3/4 into our meal the manager came by to check on us too! That was also a very nice touch and shows that this restaurant really cares about their customer satisfaction. I've dined at the San Mateo and Irvine Melting Pot in the past and this place is the best one I've tried.

The Fiesta Cheese Fondue is awesome! We also enjoyed the bursting, spicy flavor of the French Quarter entree consisting of Shrimp, Filet, chicken and sausage! The dipping sauce are all delicious. It's hard to choose which one to use. 

Although I was here with my friend, I would have LOVED the privacy their little booths for two offer. They even have curtains for you and the staff will warn you before they open them to serve your food. Very romantic idea! Outside is a cute little fire pit too!

This is definitely a great place for a date or to celebrate anniversaries. Besides, fondue is fun!"}
{"text":"So another first for me and I must say my girls and I very much enjoyed our experience here.  I read all the reviews last night knowing we would be dining here the next evening.  The only complaints I really worried about were the small portions but that was no where near an issue....we have never left a restaurant more full!

When we entered we were very pleasantly greeted and shown to the booth we had reserved right away.  Our server Laura was quick to greet us and explain the menu, choices and her suggestions.

Let my girls order virgin strawberry daiquiris and I ordered one for myself as well and they were delicious!

We decided to go with the 4 course meal for $40.50 a person and it was a great deal.  We started with the Wisconsin cheese fondue which was amazing.  With the green onions, scallions and black pepper, white wine and dry sherry.  The only complaint we had was you could taste the alcohol a little too much in the cheese, which when dining with kids was a bit bothersome.  I didn't like the veggies in the cheese, just didn't seem like a good combo to me.  I would prefer to see just a larger variety of bread instead of 2 choices. All in all the cheese fondue was delicious.

The salads were very good as well.  One of my girls went with the sweet dressing as opposed to the peppercorn ranch on the Melting Pot house salad and she didn't eat any of it.  Said the dressing was way too sweet.  I very much liked my house salad with the peppercorn ranch.  Not a ton of croutons, a very good even amount of everything. The salad was crisp and fresh and not drowned in dressing.  Was happy with this course as well.

On to the main course!  We had shrimp, herb chicken, pork, sirloin and teriyaki steak.  The teriyaki steak, shrimp and sirloin were very good, fresh and tender.  We did not care for the herb chicken at all.  The pork was good as well but I believe was a teriyaki pork and the taste was very overwhelming.  Only trouble with ordering a main course is each piece takes anywhere from a minute and 30 seconds to 2 to 3 minutes to cook so it is very tiring cooking everything.  My suggestion is to get a rhythm going.  You get 2 fondue forks, while you have one in the pot cooking something eat what is on your plate...then when you are done the next thing is ready to come out.  While we enjoyed the main course we all agreed we wouldn't do it again.  Next time would just come for the cheese and dessert.

Speaking of dessert!!  Delish!!  We went with the original blend, the chocolate and chunky peanut butter.  Wish our pot had been turned up a little higher so it was a little warmer but I could have asked as well and I am sure they would have done it.  We ate it so fast though it didn't matter too much!  The rice krispy treats, marshmallows, brownies, pound cake, cheesecake and strawberries were out of this world!!  By the time we left we were all ready to go home and sleep!

Overall we were very happy with our experience here.  A manager came by at the end of our meal and made sure everything had been to our liking.  Every person of the service staff we encountered was very nice and helpful.

One of the only negative I would have to say about the atmosphere is I think it should be a certain age and above, this is not a kid type restaurant.  While trying to enjoy our meal there was a child, perhaps a little under the age of two who found it funny to make the same loud yelling noise over and over for about 20 mins.  Not his fault but parents need to either correct the behavior, leave this age of child at home when dining here or go to a more family type place to eat.  I would encourage the managers to be more aware of this as well, it would have been nice for one of them to take the initiative and ask about quieting the child for their other customers. 

We will be returning to the establishment as overall it was a fabulous and fun experience that everyone should have.  Yes it is pricey but I believe worth the money as you will go home stuffed and satisfied!"}
{"text":"Food was mediocre, and the service was AWFUL. 
The bathrooms looked like they hadn't been cleaned in a week, and they smelled SO bad!!! I lost my appetite after using the restroom.  
I mentioned the bathrooms needed to be cleaned to the manager, and he just nodded at me and walked away. No apology, didn't say they would clean them ASAP, nothing. The booths and wallpaper look like they came out of a cheap motel. The decorations they put up for Valentines were literally from the DOLLAR STORE. This is supposed to be a 5 star restaurant. 

When we go and spend $200 for the two of us on a Holiday, we expect excellent service and food, but we would have gotten better service and food at APPLEBEES. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE."}
{"text":"I don't recomend if you are really hungry, portions are very small, and price is insulting. I would recomend Hiro Sushi over Melting Pot"}
{"text":"Purchased the Groupon to try this place out. Took my girlfriend to have a nice dinner. When we arrived, I found there was plenty of parking space and in a really nice area. We were greeted immediately. There were no problems with our reservations. We chose a curtain booth, which, not surprisingly, is a booth with a curtain. The booth was pretty small, along with the table. Not too much room to eat or move plates around. But once you receive the delicious food, it doesn't matter. All the food was well put together and in generous servings, and the waitstaff was very intentive. They even accommodated a request for candles at the table. This is not a cheap place, but definitely worth it. I will be back in the future for more fondue deliciousness!!!"}
{"text":"Three years in a row....every anaversary.....this place rocks!! You will spend 2 quality hrs with the one u love enjoying food and company in private booths. Love this place"}
{"text":"Fantastic experience!! The food, the service, everything was absolutely amazing. Our server, Joe was so great! We will definitely be coming back to see him. We dine at melting pot often and this was our favorite visit. Thanks Joe, we will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I went here because there was a living social deal (or maybe it was groupon). Either way, the prices are so outrageous that I never wanted to check the place out. 
It was a fun experience and the food was good - I wouldn't go back again based on their normal prices (you're easily spending at least $120 for two people), but if there were another \"deal\" offer, I would go back. 
It's definitely worth trying at least once, just for the experience and the food is good too (but not amazing or anything)."}
{"text":"This place brings a lot of key ingredients to the table, in terms of fun experience. This place would be excellent for kids that love to experience cooking their own food as well as fun for adults. My girlfriend and I use the time in between cooking to catch up on conversation, so we certainly draw out our cooking to enjoy each other more & it brings about a very nice ambiance, with the private booths as well as the fireplace they have. I highly recommend this place for a date night but only if you can handle cooking your own food."}
{"text":"This restaurant is so cool! It is so fun that you get to cook your own food in the melting pot! However it is kind of pricey, especially because they're not even cooking your food! But the food is delicious! I loved the spinach cheese dip and the smores  dessert! I will definitely go back"}
{"text":"This place is way over hyped! Went for birthday and all the little plates they bring to dip into fondues are all very, very, very low quality. The novelty of having to basically prepare your main course by cooking it yourself in the fondue was pretty gross. I didn't realize that I'd have to cook my own dinner by sticking the skewers with raw meat
Into the pot, so gross. It's so expensive and I'd much rather have a fine chef prepare my dinner. When we walked into the restaurant it smelled so strong like bleach I thought I'd be sick. At 6:45 pm they were scrubbing at entrance with bleach. So gross. This place gets two stars for the novelty but it was pretty horrible. Don't spend the money! I'm really surprised I didn't get food poisoning!"}
{"text":"L. took me out for a belated birthday dinner this evening here. I had yelped it prior and was pretty excited for what seemed to be a \"one of a kind\" experience.

As soon as we walked in, I was wowed by the atmosphere. Definitely very Scottsdale-y, but not super snotty. Just very nice and sophisticated. There's definitely a lot of explanation that is involved throughout the evening, which sort of went over my head which was ok because L had been there before. 

We had the Big Night Out - and I sub'd the lettuce wrap with the chicken caesar salad. Our server warned me about the pine nuts in case I was allergic, which I'm not. But the pine nuts were bomb and definitely made the salad special. We had the fondue fusion (with lobster), and the original for dessert. Add on a few drinks between the two of us, and it was SO MUCH FOOD BUT OMGAHD SO GOOD. If I had a six-figure salary, I would be here all the time it's redick. 

It's definitely one of those special occasion places, a lot of the parties that came in after us were celebrating an anniversary or birthday. The service was great and I'll definitely be back....gotta start saving though."}
{"text":"Very good food. I liked the cheese fondue (classic). We also shared a meat, mushroom and lobster one. The dipping sauce for the veggies was good. The curry one for the steak was good, the others not so much. Charging for the cooking method is kinda weird. The chocolate fondue was delicious, loved the dipping options and variety.  Our waitress was super nice. The ambiance is off , it felt like a vegas chapel, it felt strange I cant put my finger on it...."}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure what it is with fancy restaurants and dim lights but I found it hilarious that a couple at a neighboring table was using the light from their smart phones to read the menu.  Anyway.

Waited around for the Groupon to try out this place, which came highly recommended by my friends, and it was pretty good.  My boyfriend and I got the salad and entree Groupon for two, but the portions were, in my opinion, rather small.  However, I'm not sure if this goes for the regular menu as well, or if it's just one of the limitations of using a Groupon.  On a side note, the four-courses-for-$40 menu insert had my favorite phrase, \"all you can eat\", but I'm not sure if there was any fine print to it.

On top of the Groupon, we got two servings of the dark chocolate fondue, and it was delicious - it beat our entrees hands-down.  But again, I wish there was more.

Would I come back?  It was definitely a nice slow dinner with mediocre service and good food in minute portions.  But without the Groupon, I probably won't be back, unless that 4 course dinner was truly, in every sense of the word, unlimited."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for our Anniversary, and , as always, enjoyed it immensely!! Service is outstanding, and it is such a great evening.. Love the choices you have, and the various courses. If you want something special to do for a restaurant, this is your place!!"}
{"text":"I decided to go out with some friends here for my 30th birthday and I am so glad we did! It was my husband and 2 other couples, and we sat in a nice, private booth and had the BEST time. We had 2 LivingSocials and got quite a deal. That's always a plus! The server was terrific and really added to our enjoyment. I like how they don't rush you out of there and really expect you to stay all evening. And we did - for over 3 hours!!! We got to try two cheeses, broths, and desserts since there were 6 of us so that was awesome. I had a really great time!"}
{"text":"We have been here only twice and both times we had a good time. Service was good, food seems very good quality, and it is overall a very fun experience.
Make sure to make a reservation and expect to spend about 2 hours here if you go for the 4 course meal. I would recommend you go for it because is the one that offers more value, in my opinion. $54 per person plus drinks, tax and tip, for the Charity option that includes 4 courses with endless main course.
Well, not sure if it can be considered endless as I guess they do not refill the broth once the level is lowered, but it is still a good meal.
If you are not familiar with the concept, the charity option includes cheese fondue with bread and vegetables, salad, main entrée cooked in broth, and the chocolate fondue option for dessert.
This is a nice place to celebrate a special occasion, you can ask for a private booth if available."}
{"text":"Okay, first of all, this is kinda pricey so it's not the place I'd go weekly.  However, a few times a year this place is awesome!  They have a gluten free menu and they do host special gluten free nights at Scottsdale,  where this time, they featured Jewel's Cupcakes (soon to be bakery cafe) desserts and bread.  The second time there was a special night with a percentage of proceeds going to the Celiac Foundation.  Win/win!  

First time there we had the four course meal which included the salad.  I was thinking that I wouldn't want the salad in deference to the main pot but I am telling you that this was one of the best salads I have EVER had in my life.  Seriously.  That good!  It was a specific menu for that season so I cannot remember what salad it was but it was divine!

The cheese fondue is good.  I have found after two trips it is okay, not my favorite though and IF I had to ixnay one course the cheese would be the first to go.  The Mojo pot for the main course may set you back another $6 bucks but it's totally worth it.  The flavors are awesome!  When they bring all the veggies, do yourself a favor and have them add them all in immediately to the pot.  The potatoes take forever to cook and the flavor is more prevalent after a longer cook time. 

the Mushrooms are fantastic with the Gorgonzola dip.  The green goddess dip goes best with the broccoli and I love the plum sauce for shrimp and the chicken though the curry dip is good for chicken as well.  I don't do red meat so the hubs ate the beef and pork and I did the chicken and shrimp.  Nicely done!

Dessert chocolate.  I've had both the peanut butter chocolate and the Turtle.  GET THE TURTLE!  Both are good but the turtle is to die for.  Combine that with Jewel'sCupcake (soon to be cafe) gluten free espresso cream puffs and brownies and cheesecake...........foodgasm!  Seriously.  Better than, well you get the idea.

I wish they carried Jewel's items all the time to dip with.  Even her main course bread put into the chocolate was nom nom!

GO...........celebrate something.  Enjoy the atmosphere........dark, quiet.  Plan on spending three or four hours............of luxury eating!"}
{"text":"I went here to celebrate getting a new job with my fiancé. Food was excellent and service was very personable. It is a little bit on the pricey side and I recommend getting a reservation, but it's not a place you would go to once a week. It's more of a special occasion joint."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to celebrate our 18th wedding anniversary. We had never been to a restaurant like this. We had made some cheese fondue at home and figured we would give it a try. We had a great experience, The food was delicious. Our server was GREAT. He was very knowledgable and helped us through the process. Cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"Poor service and cramped feet space under the table made this experience less then I had expected.  I was also a bit upset that they included a gratuity on the check and I was not able to control how much i tipped the bad service we got."}
{"text":"Mediocre food.  Bad service.  Cheesecake Factory food and ambiance."}
{"text":"We have gone here several times. The menu has been changed completely . The filet was tough and did not have the flavor of a filet. Meat had gristle in it.Cheese was good, Bread was very hard and dry. Server was excellent. We split a entree and were charged extra for the oil that used to be included.Also charged extra for the same amount of chocolate that you normally get for one.Has become very pricey."}
{"text":"I would much rather have someone cook for me... but that's just me. Not an every month venture but perhaps you need to visit occasionally! 
Great service!"}
{"text":"This is one of my absolutely favorite places to eat. Here is my guide to having a 5 star experience at this restaurant. 

1. Make reservations a few weeks in advance to be sure to get the time slot you are interested it. They fill up fast.

2. Go for an occasion, not a holiday. Go because its your birthday, or you are celebrating a big business deal. Not on Valentines Day. This is not me saying it would be bad on Valentine's Day, but most people get frustrated when its busy at places like this and don't realize that, well, yeah...its VALENTINE'S DAY. (If you can set the right expectations then HECK YEAH go on Valentine's Day)

3. DO NOT and I repeat DO NOT take your kids here. It is not that the staff wouldn't be amazing to your kids, it is the fact that most people are here for a quiet night out, not a screaming 2 year old. (I leave my screaming 2 year old at home.) Here's the catch, if your kid is old enough to enjoy a good meal and experience and you would like some one on one time with them to perhaps congratulate them on good grades etc, this may not be a bad idea. Again...screaming 2 year old = NO.

4. Finding deals for this place is also a good tip. Sometimes you will see coupons in your local mailer, or you can sign up for their newsletter. If not prepare yourself for a high bill. Same as when you go to Fogo de Chao. You know you are going to a nice place, you also know you are paying for it. Go in with a good mindset and be expecting it and it wont shock you, either that or drink some of their fabulous cocktails and then you wont care!

5. Booths with privacy curtains. Don't ask. However be aware that they do have them and they can be fun. (Assuming here, I have never sat in one).

6. Last but not least and most important. I do not care if you are on a diet, or diabetic, or hate chocolate (what kind of nut are you). Make time, don't eat for a week, take insulin, and have the chocolate fondue. This is absolutely amazing and worth the trip every time!

Follow my 6 steps and you will have a great time at The Melting Pot!"}
{"text":"Dessert is my absolute favorite and I'd have it first every time if I weren't with people who like to do things \"the normal way\".  

 If you are gonna do the Melting Pot, do it right! Go all out and don't look at the bill! This isn't a place for cheap-o's.  

If you are in a hurry, this also isn't the place for you.  Expect at least two hours here!

If you expect your food to be served cooked, you are in for a treat!  You cook your own food here, hence the \"Fondu\" part. 

I've been to the one in Scottsdale and they even offer \"private booths\" with little curtains so you can't see the naughty things people do with fondu! In any case, you will need reservations, this place fills up fast!

Beginners:  You get to your table and you are presented with an crazy menu.  First order the type of cheese fondu you want.  Then you order your salads, your main entree (if you bring a guy, order extra and LET HIM KNOW you cook your own food here). It can take a while, so order an appetizer or something because you can get hungry waiting.  The meets and veggies are cut skewer size so it cooks pretty fast.

Cheese Fondu: I suggest the Spinach Artichoke Cheese
Cooking Fondu: The Coq Au Vin
Dessert:- I'm biased because I get the same one everytime - Chocolate S'mores. I'd lick that damn fondu pot like licking is going outta style!

Old timers: You know the drill - have you tried theBIg Night Out?  Its probably the best deal around.

The questionable:  The wait time in between courses and then waiting to eat my courses.  I guess that's the whole point. Savor, right? I think the meat portions could be more generous, but that could be me being a porker.

Bottom Line:  GET DESSERT. GET DESSERT. GET DESSERT!"}
{"text":"The fondue style is kind of fun and the service is outstanding. The food it's self was not real exciting. The \"Cheddar Cheese\" fondue was no where near cheese - I'm not sure what it was. My husband and his buddy had one drink and then were cut off. Our friend is a little loud and flamboyant so maybe they thought he was drunk. Anyway, it was kind of a bummer for my birthday. The place is ultra quiet. Maybe it's supposed to be romantic, but I think it would great for families and kids."}
{"text":"Yes this place is expensive but that's why it's a nice elegant fancy place to eat!  They give you endless  fruit or bread for your cheese fondu. The service was awesome! I didn't like the main dish I ordered because it wasn't what I was expecting, and he gladly took it back and gave me what my boyfriend ordered. Not to mention it came out so fast!

This place is intimate, great for date night with the boy! Or date night with a girl! 

If you sign up on their website, they give you free chocolate fondu for two next time you go there. You have to order cheese fondu an 2 meals but that's still awesome!"}
{"text":"Do you know how in high school, if you don't have the money (or are too cheap to spend it) for a fancy prom date?  Well, if you know, then you know you choose a fake fancy restaurant, that let's folks wear jeans, charges too much, and gives too little.  You know?  Well, that's The Melting Pot.

We were fortunate to buy a Groupon on sale, but that's not to say we felt those precious dollars were spent well.  The discount still left us feeling like we over paid.  While the food was good, the prices are ridiculously inflated.  Had I paid full price for the vegetarian entree I ordered, it would have been $25 for 4 halves of artichoke heart, 4 tofu wedges, 4 slices of mushroom, 4 asparagus stalks and 4 raviolis.  $25 is half my weekly budget in groceries.  Sorry, this ain't no prom date.

The lighting is very low and the atmosphere feels posh, kind of sleek.  So, again, some fancy feeling for you.  Apparently reservations are highly suggested (why people line up, I just don't know).  We sat at the bar, albeit comfortably.

Still, our server was pleasant and helpful.  Nothing out of the ordinary.  An attempt here and there to up sale, a smile, a description of what's in our \"melting pot.\"

Overall, if you want to stab your food, feel fancy, and eat very little, this is the place for you.  I really don't know why anyone would spend the money it costs to eat here, when there are other options, but, if you like pretense of a prom date, this is a right fit for you."}
{"text":"This place is great!  I've been several times, with my husband as well as with girlfriends.  It's good for either occasion.  Girls can go and chat and catch up, and it's also good for a romantic dinner.  It does take a while to eat, and is pricey, but you get your money's worth.  The waiters are fantastic, very helpful.  They don't rush you through your meal, you can take as long as you'd like with each course.

They have a four course meal for two, about $90, that is great.  Cheese, salad, main course and chocolate for dessert.  This is the way to go."}
{"text":"Just finished dinner for twelve at melting pot. Had a lot of fun service was excellent. It was a busy night but they did great. Veggies were fresh salads were crisp and the meat was lean and nicely seasoned  staff was excellent.  Mille and Greta were really exceptional."}
{"text":"I went here about a year ago with a friend and enjoyed it. Nice staff, good food and was pleased. I have a group of friends from work that we rotate selecting a restaurant to out eat at. I decided on The Melting Point as my choice and phoned the restaurant to place the reservation. The guy taking the reservations could hardly be heard or understood--there was no accent just a rushed feeling to get off the phone.

I explained there would be a party of 8 people dining for dinner. I was told I needed to provide a credit card to hold the reservation and if we were late or no-shows a $10 per person charge would be applied. WHAT!?!

Needless to say, I contacted my friends and picked another restaurant that doesn't pull these kinds of tricks. Sorry Melting Pot, but that's a bit rude and a good way to drive off repeat customers."}
{"text":"Definitely a fun date spot because you get plenty of time to chat with each other and the atmosphere is dark and intimate.  But in my opinion, it's just too much cheese.  And you cook everything yourself. And it can be a little messy.  And it's pricey. 

But at the same time, the food is good, so I can't say anything against it.  It's just not my cup o' tea.

The dessert is very good as well, but you will fo sho leave here feeling as if you've ate waaaay too much.  Most likely because you did!"}
{"text":"Came in for my anniversary dinner with the love of my life. Spent a wonderful evening indulging in dark chocolate with Grand Mariner, strawberries and cheesecakes. Our entree was a phenomenal duck and filet mignon. The only thing that made this already decadent meal better was the accompaniment of our waiter Anthony, he was like a Sherpa through our flavor journey. I can not stress enough how impeccable Anthony was with his guidance on taste and meal selection, from our bottle of wine to broth style Anthony was a guiding light that enhanced this flavor process."}
{"text":"Manager was very unfriendly. We had to wait around 20 minutes to be seated, despite we had a reservation and the restaurant was half-empty. After the wait we were given the most horrible seat in the middle of everything. waiter was completely stressed out, unshaven and not very friendly. Always disappeared , never checked on us or refilled our water. Waiter was unaware of the wine flights and the special menus offered. Overall, I will never return to this Melting Pot again."}
{"text":"I was a little sad because the anniversary stuff I was supposed to get was not as nice as previous pics. And they didn't have our promised strawberries. But the staff was very nice and the food was really good."}
{"text":"Me and my husband went here to celebrate our big move to Arizona. It was absolutely amazing, we got a romantic package and they came to our table to take a picture."}
{"text":"My daughter and I go here every Thursday. We always have the Cheese and Chocolate dinner. The price is very reasonable and the waiters, especially, Izzy, are great! They prepare the fondue right at your table and they will replenish the dipping items as often as you like. Try the cheddar, garlic, and beer sauce for the cheese portion and the half milk, half dark chocolate for the dessert part. Best dinner in town."}
{"text":"I LOVE THE MELTING POT. I honestly don't get what other people are talking about when they say they leave this place hungry...  or that they have bad service... or that they think the food is gross... are we talking about the same restaurant here? When people complain about how it takes 2-3 hours to eat... do they realize that fondue is not standard dining? I'm genuinely confused. Every experience (about 10-15) I've had at this Melting Pot has been great. If you're looking for a romantic, slow, tranquil night out with delicious food - you will not be disappointed here.

There are so many things I enjoy about the Melting Pot, and this location in particular. It's the perfect place for a romantic date or celebration, and you can request one of the more private booths with curtains when you make your reservation - they are so intimate and cozy! I also love that they have happy hour and random deals throughout the year; in May, my boyfriend and I took advantage of the \"endless entree\" special and I can honestly say I've never eaten more filet mignon than I did that night! Also, I'm not sure if most people think to come here for \"just\" an appetizer or \"just\" dessert - but it is very affordable if you do (especially during happy hour). Like 99% of people, my favorite course is definitely the chocolate fondue. You simply can't go wrong with melted chocolate, fruits, cheesecake, pound cake, and rice krispy treats. You just can't.

The service at this location has always been top-notch. I always feel as if I'm royalty when dining here! I love it. It is truly a unique experience that you won't get at a standard restaurant. I have never felt put off by the hostesses or servers and every time I've dined here, the manager has come up to my table to make sure everything is okay. 

If you decide to dine here, I highly suggest making a reservation as they fill up quickly on weekends and holidays. Also, check out the specials they have (which are on their website) to make sure you're getting the most cost-efficient option."}
{"text":"Overpriced for mediocre food. It's the novelty that you pay for.
We did the Four Course option, add lobster.
Nothing blew me away, except my company.  :)
I'm glad I experienced it once, but probably won't go back for dinner. (Dessert, possibly.)"}
{"text":"I love fondue, but I'm not coming back to this restaurant. 

I had dinner here on a Wednesday at 6:30pm and was really disappointed by how rushed the experience felt. The place couldn't have been more than half full, but corporate must have told them to turn the tables more quickly. Our server didn't really come check on how we were doing, but every time he arrived I felt like a kid who hadn't done my homework - I don't know what I want for my next course! I just started eating what's in front of me. I told him twice to give us more time to decide, but I should have been more assertive. 

The part of dinner I had looked forward to most was the blackberry lemonade, and that was a fail. I wanted nonalcoholic and should have specified. The server could have clarified or noticed I didn't drink it and asked if I needed something else. Instead we didn't have time to talk about it until after the bill so I paid $8 for a drink I couldn't drink. I should have insisted he take it off the bill, and he should have offered but, like I said, he was trying to get us out of there ASAP and we were gone by 7:15pm (not exactly closing time). 

I go out to dinner for a relaxing evening of good food and conversation, and everyone was polite, but the speed of the experience made me feel unwelcome."}
{"text":"The Melting Pot is soooo goooood.  And it's such a great place to go with friends.  I've been several times and would recommend it for birthdays, New Years, special meals, whatever!

I love the Wisconsin Trio for the cheese fondue and the Lobster Indulgence for dinner.  For dessert, I like Yin and Yang.  

Be prepared to spend well over $100 for a couple though.  It ain't cheap.  That and you'll want to be sure you have a reservation as this place is always packed."}
{"text":"The man who greeted us (who I assume was the manager) had a bit of an attitude. We came later in the evening and he seemed pretty annoyed. But our server was super sweet, attentive, and made conversation with us. We were visiting from New York and we had been to The Melting Pot in White Plains so we wanted to try this one. This restaurant is a bit pricey but if you're looking to splurge a little more on dinner, especially if it's an occasion, I recommend The Melting Pot! Also cool that you get to cook your entrees yourself!"}
{"text":"This is one of the very few chain restaurants I like...

Tried this new location on Saturday night (they recently moved into a new bigger building next door). 

Melting Pot is an adventure in dining, a prolonged multi-hour dinner experience. I love fondue, and The Melting Pot are the masters of fondue!

Started with cheese, apples, breads, and veggies with a cheddar cheese and beer concoction. Moved on to lobster, shrimp, steak, pork, and chicken which we cooked in a veggie broth. Finished the meal with a chocolate and peanut butter dip with cheesecake, strawberries, and rice crispy treats.

Great service, great food, great wine list, great times!"}
{"text":"The melting pot has a beautiful ambiance and a lovely setting for couples who want privacy. I like the booths that are closed off by the curtains as well as the flavorful menu, what I liked best was the meat selection, especially the steak. The desert was not bad, but I recommend getting it if you really have a taste for it at the time. Will highly recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"I want to be clear when I say that service was very very good     We had a very fun evening but with what we thought was confusing  on the menu there were five of us eating or just 4 cocktails at our bill including tip was around $400      I left there and as the night progressed I really felt like we were taking advantage of and I'm very disappointed but probably won't go back     I make a pretty good salary but I do know that that kind of money must be for an exceptional dinner and this was no exception but very nice      Very disappointed in involved with Dry bread and not the highest quality meats       I considered reversing the charge on my credit card but my husband said that would be the wrong thing to do.  I feel it's on the contrary     Definitely feel a little bent over the couch     We were so excited because in the past our Experience was so much better.  No more melting pot for us. :("}
{"text":"As a first time goer I found my experience a bit unsettling. I was waiting on refills of soda and water on two separate occasions throughout my night. The process was explained to me very poorly and it was quite rushed. I found my self confused more often than I found myself in a state of satisfaction. The portions were subpar and the service was no better. My broth where you cook your meats was sitting boiling for over 20 minutes before we actually got the meats which got me curios as to if it was still at the peak of deliciousness and maximum flavor. My wife and I did enjoy the scrumptious desserts, that was the highlight of the night but the competition wasn't too stiff."}
{"text":"We love this place.

The atmosphere is great. It's really gorgeous in there.

The food is amazing. Dessert is even more amazing.

We can't afford to go here often, but it's wonderful for special dates like anniversaries. I love it."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE.
We got there & let the hostess know it would be a total of 8 adults and 2 kids. She automatically said they couldnt do that and that they didn't have the availability. When you could clearly look around and see the place was EMPTY. As soon as the manager went over to greet us her attitude changed and she said how she had told us it would be 5-10 min. I then pointed out how that is not what she had told us & the manager took me to choose where we would like to sit. 
After we took our seats, the worst part began. The server was just bad, he sucked. He was loud and rude. Not to mention that he would take 3 times the time it usually takes but then hurried us out at the end. 
You do not get the service you pay for.

I wouldn't recommend this location to ANYONE. Stuck up, snotty. rude staff. Never plan on going back."}
{"text":"I have been to all 3 Locations and have never been disappointed! 
Stopped by with friends and service was fast and friendly, with a couple of special requests handled with a smile. 
Great food, just be prepared for the concept of 'cooking' your own food and know where the Timer is on you Phone Clock!"}
{"text":"I had never been to The Melting Pot and when the girlfriend found a coupon in the mail, she thought it'd be a fun night out.

We went on a Thursday, to keep the cost \"down\" a bit. We did the Big Night Out special at $69, she had an $8 glass of wine and I had a $2.50 iced tea. The meal started with the regular cheddar cheese fondue, which tasted great. They bring out as many dippers as you want, but we exhausted the cheese in one go.

Next up were the salads. I had a house salad with the peppercorn ranch which was tasty and she had a California salad, which included gorgonzola and a raspberry vinaigrette. I'm not a fan of bleu-type cheeses, but the dressing really sold it.

The main course was part of their island/pacific inspired seasonal special. The platter included chicken, beef, pork tenderloin, kiwi shrimp, pasta, and ahi tuna. It didn't appear to be a ton of food, but it definitely filled us up--we even left a few pieces to spare. We had it with the coq au vin oil.

Finally, we tried the bananas foster chocolate fondue, but with dark chocolate instead. Our server flambee'd the bananas and sprinkled cinnamon into the mix which made sparks. Very cool. They served strawberries, rice krispies, marshmallows, brownies, cheesecake, and pound cake. A great assortment.

Our waiter was informed, helpful, and attentive. Our booth was an intimate two person right-angle type table, which was nice, but a bit claustrophobic. 

At the end of the day, the food was tasty but it didn't wow me. I've had amazing meals. Meals that leave you wanting to tell the story, shouting about them from the rooftops. Meals with superb presentation, wonderful experimentation, and the results of a master chef who has truly honed his craft and knows just what to put together and how best to accomplish it. I've had that for far less than $110 (tax & tip) for two people, too.

The value proposition component really sticks with me here. The food was good, but it wasn't phenomenal. It wasn't life-changing. The presentation was nice, the seasonings were good, things were flavorful, but at the end of the day, I didn't leave with a sense of awe and utter contentment. I was full, and I was happy, but I expect a whole lot more when I dip into the $100/couple range for a meal.

Now, to be fair, you get four courses. More than enough food. It's a romantic setting (with somewhat varied music) and they execute the concept very well. I guess I was disappointed because I want a story to tell when I spend that much money on a meal, and I didn't get one."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner here on a Tuesday night!

We made reservations (not that they were totally necessary) and were promptly seated upon our arrival. 

Our waiter Ralph was awesome from the beginning. Super friendly, walked us through the process and menu, remembered our drinks and was attentive. 

We opted for the four course meal (cheese fondue, salad, main course, chocolate fondue) as I am sure most people do. We kept it pretty basic with our selections: Wisconsin Cheddar, Land and Sea (filet mignon, chicken breast, and shrimp), and pure milk chocolate. 

The cheddar fondue was great. You get three types of bread, apples, carrots, celery, olives, salami and some more assorted vegetables of various nature to dip.   

Once you are done with your first course, the salads come out. We had Caesar and spinach and apple. They were average side salads. A nice touch to break up your fondue sessions though. 

Then it's on to the main. You pick what kind of boiling seasoning you want essentially and then your main dishes come out raw. We were advised how long to cook everything for and away you go. 

The filet and chicken were solid. The shrimp was meh but I didn't expect much anyways. Again, to me this part of the meal is to break up the richer fondues and get you some protein. It was definitely enjoyable but don't come here if you are looking for an amazing steak. 

Then, finally, the best part: dessert. Our dipping selection included strawberries, banana, pineapple, rice crispys, funfetti cake, brownies, blondes, marshmallows, raspberry and blackberries, and cream puffs. Each item was to die for after dipping in the milk chocolate. If I were to pick only one course to have... it's this one. I mean cmon. The coffee was pretty good too. 

I never felt rushed during our meal. We were there for a little over two hours, and our waiter let us know that's about how long the four course meal would run at the beginning which was nice. It's a good meal if you want to take it slow and chat while eating smaller plates. 

This is a pricey place and you are paying some for the novelty but I don't think that takes away from your meal at all, unless you are super picky. I would come here to celebrate an occasion or if you want to try something different and enjoy a longer meal."}
{"text":"Good but very pricey. Our server Alli was excellent, friendly, and knowledgeable. Overall a very good experience and a cozy dining room!"}
{"text":"We ordered the \"fondue for 2\"....it was WAYYYYY too much food.  and i hate wasting food especially if i cant take it home.  Come on a double date, this place isnt as romantic as you'd think it would be anyway...lots of families there.  The atmosphere feels like a steakhouse too.  I have since bought a fondue set of my own and we do it at home often.  Way more fun (and easier on the wallet)."}
{"text":"Fun experience, but can get pricey. Really enjoy the cheese and the chocolate. I am happy to skip the salads and the main course."}
{"text":"Buyer Beware!!  Be prepared to drop more $$ than you anticipate with your local dine coupon.  The coupon was $50 for the four course big night out dinner for two.  What they don't tell you is it really costs $83 for this meal.  So.....we spent $25 on the coupon for $50.  You will pay the difference on this deal, plus drinks and they add a $20 tip on top of this (for you to cook your own dinner!!).  We felt totally ripped off when we got the bill for $79.63!  This is a VERY misleading coupon.  We have not had this problem with others from local dines.  Needless to say, we will not go back to the Melting Pot again, nor recommend this place.  Local Dines needs to be more specific with the coupons and what you are really getting.  Also we had a private booth which was nice and cozy, however the music was very loud and not anything we like to listen to (old torch songs), we asked them to turn down the volume three times and it was still too loud in our booth!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to the melting pot for our Valentine's day dinner this year and we were quite disappointed... 

The service was annoying.  Our waiter kept trying to joke with us, he shared far too much personal information, and he was sweating into our fondue while making it...

The ambiance is dark... Too dark, I could barely see my smoking hot date.

The food was mediocre, lacking any flavor whatsoever.  The bread was stale, the vegetables were borderline rotten, and the meats were TOUGH and bland...

Really, the only thing remotely tasty was the dessert.  We got the plain milk chocolate... kind of hard to mess up... and we received about 1/4 of a cup of it... pretty skimpy portion if you ask me.

The Melting Pot was TERRIBLE.  Please do not go here.  Save yourself the bill and make fondue at home.  I expected so much more from this restaurant and was let down."}
{"text":"If you're into high priced gimmicks and constant snacking and dipping, this is the perfect alternative to an ACTUAL restaurant. 

There's so much dipping going on that You will even experience a dip in your bank account as you overpay for a bowl of vegetables and other inexpensive raw agricultural commodities. 

When you call to place a reservation they will express the importance of doing so, and then will tell you to just come in and not take your name down to ensure a lengthy wait upon arrival.

If you're with a party of 2, be prepared to dine in a phone booth that turns into a sauna as the boiling pot continues radiating heat and steam. The food is pretty good albeit unreasonably overpriced. I'd be lying if I didn't say it's a complete rip off.

It's very likely a good place to go to try and seduce an unwitting date with alcohol, gimmicks and sweet treats, just be prepared to empty your wallet."}
{"text":"Food was excellent! Atmosphere was wonderful! A fun experience! Service was mediocre but we would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Service was great.  The pricing for value literally is insulting.  A small portion of bread, a pinch of vegetables, and a sad quarter of an apple with standard melted cheddar doctored up with bud light, garlic, seasoning, etc. = $18.

Almost upsetting how bad that experience remains."}
{"text":"I love this place! I went there with a group of friends for my boyfriends birthday on December 19,2013 and our waiter was excellent and so was the food! The only weird thing was having to cook your own food, but other than that it was great. Get the turtle chocolate fondu, it's to die for!"}
{"text":"JANUARY 2017 (apologies for the posting delay)
Sadly, the overall experience was terrible, mainly because of poor/mis-management. Our waiter, Jake and bartender, Jason, were terrific (& we tipped very well). It was clear they were understaffed, and they did well given staff/management limitations. It was a surprise 50th birthday party (we were going \"old school\" fun!). I called the evening before to ensure all would go smoothly. When I talked to a manager on Tuesday (can't remember his name), I stated we may be 12 (OpenTable reservation was 10). He said, \"No problem\". GREAT! The Tuesday manager also said we would be in the party room, would have 4 burners (for the cheese/chocolate) and that we could walk around and mingle. PERFECT! 
That did not happen. The floor manager on Wednesday, Tony Bruno, decided differently: No Party room (he said it was too much trouble/electricity). He forced us (i.e. NO choice) to sit at a long, partitioned booth for 10 with 3 burners. We could not get in and out. We said more than 10 were coming. Tony said they could sit at the NEXT table (i.e. 3 feet away and bolted to the ground). He would not move us or accommodate. UNPROFESSIONAL! When the 11th person arrived, we had to pull up a 5th chair to the 4-top portion of the booth, meaning 5 customers had to share. 1 burner HORRIBLE! 
No movement. Less choice. Cramped in. Slow service (not because of Jake).  The only time Tony seemed attentive was when the checks arrived (4 of the 11 had to be corrected). 
Lastly, we arrived 10 minutes early. Tony said we could not get any service (e.g. drinks) before 6pm. Tony Bruno treated us as an inconvenience. As a business owner, I am confident that the Melting Pot owners/top-managers would not have been happy with how Tony handled any of this. 
It is sad. This was supposed to be a fun party. I believe there are now 11 very connected Scottsdale/Phoenix residents/ decision makers who will never return to The Melting Pot."}
{"text":"Mediocre food that is hysterically overpriced.  Living Social voucher was not valid for regular menu items; management utterly failed here. Slow service."}
{"text":"Okay so I'm just going to tell you this place is a must go to for any event! Melting pot was very clean, quite and very peaceful. I choose this place cause the overloads of great news I heard about the food! Not only is the food amazing but the server and other employees are very helpful.


Marcus was my server and I'll give him 5 stars he was great to us and answered any questions we had. He was very confident in the menu and questions that I asked him.

Not only am I going to tell people about this place but I believe I found a new spot to add to my weekly outing! 

Marcus and victor you guys ROCK!"}
{"text":"Where do I start?  Hmm.  Okay, first of all, our server was fantastic.  In fact, the entire staff seems amazing.

Next?  Decor.  Slightly stuffy, dark, very \"Scottsdale Formal Circa 2005.\"  What does that mean?  A sort of a cross between Tuscan, and French Provincial?  Whatever.  They did have super cute little (very little) curtained privacy booths for more intimate dining.  Honestly, that's kind of gross even though they're cute.
I mean, what are they DOING in there??

Food should probably be next.  And this is where it goes south.  You noticed the 1 star rating didn't you?

The cheese fondue was the Alpine, the dipping items were some very LARGE bread chunks, and some very SMALL granny smith apple pieces.  Verdict?  Skip it.  the nutmeg they add only really tastes good with the apples, and the fondue was grainy and whatever the opposite of smooth would be.  For some odd reason, the bread tasted TERRIBLE with it.  Maybe the bread should have been toasted?

Entree was the endless one with two kinds of beef, some chicken, shrimp, green raviolis, and a small bowl of veg.

The ravioli was vile, one of the shrimp was spoiled.  On the other hand, the chicken was fresh, and both cuts of beef were of good quality.  The nice thing about this entree is that you can ask for more of the items that you like.

The dipping sauces were hit and miss.  A couple were good, and the rest were a variety ranging from not good to vile.  It was a similar situation regarding the batters.  One was good.  The other?  Absolutely disgusting.

The big down side to the entree?  After a few minutes, the smell of the heated oil made me outright sick to my stomach.
On to the dessert.  We ordered the dark chocolate.  It came with some very small cubes of brownie and blondie (these were good), some very small cubes of pound cake (that tasted like the refrigerator), some rice krispy treat squares,  and some small banana slices.
The dark chocolate was grainy and insanely, ridiculously, SWEET. I love dark chocolate.  I love it in all of it's forms, but this?  Tasted like Hershey's chocolate sauce-but with sand and extra sugar in it.
I wouldn't go again even for free. I believe I will be washing dogs that evening instead."}
{"text":"This was my first time with my husband, I had heard it was over priced and that was definitely the case. The decor does need an update for sure. The service was great, the quality of food meh. The main course was good, the cheese in the appetizer was gritty and the wine's aftertaste was over powering. Our little bits of Apple came very brown and cut in tiney and giant pieces. The bread was stale and inconsistent in size. I felt like a duck getting old bread at the park. The dessert was good no doubt, but was 6 berries, a small piece of cheesecake and brownie bites. They added gratuity to the bill beforehand that was more than 20% and with water to drink a $220 bill!! There is no way this should cost this much. It's just not worth it."}
{"text":"Generally speaking the food is great so kudos to the kitchen.  The service at this one in particular has fallen off.  Our meal took 3 hours......the waiter kept completely shutting off the burners between courses so the burners had to completely warm up everytime. We asked for refills on our water about 17 times and they still couldn't seem to get us one refill. 

Oh and it's nice that they give you a Yelp check in deal but we had a $20 gift certificate  (on our $300 bill) so they would not honor the yelp free 3 strawberries to take home. Straight from the manager....lame.  

Try the Awauhtukee location."}
{"text":"Who can say no to dipping things in cheese? Who can say no to dipping things in chocolate? I decided to have a small gathering for my birthday, and I have never been here before and have always wanted to try. I pretty much knew I was going to enjoy the food before setting foot in the restaurant (again, cheese and chocolate). It would have to be something pretty awful to make me dislike that. Since we were a big enough party, we could try two types of cheese, broth for the main entree, and chocolates. Our server helped us navigate the process well. I don't have a single complaint, other than I couldn't order a second entree on the endless fondue because I was already popping buttons on my pants. So. Much. Food. I also appreciated their selection of local brews, although I have a suggestion for them if they ever want to expand (Sonoran White Chocolate, anyone?)

Would I go again? Definitely. I wouldn't get the 4-course meal, that is really pricey. Probably just separate cheese and chocolate selections. A great place to splurge now and again."}
{"text":"One of the best experiences in my life!!! Where do I start? I knew North Scottsdale is well known for all these fancy restaurants but I couldn't imagine the awesome experience...

My boyfriend took me here on a Sunday night. The place was not crowded, instead, quiet, romantic, slow-paced. (That's exactly what I like). Emily, the manager, immediately seated us. They mostly have both with an electric stove and a pot on it...you can imagine all the good food ahead of time! 

Ty was our server. He explained the menu, items, how the burner works, and recommended the endless 4-course menu where you can eat all you want. The Fiesta Cheese fondue was delicious! It was a long time since my last cheese fondue, I really enjoyed the combination of cheddar and jalapeño flavor. California salad was also really good. I liked this restaurant for the originality that they bring you different kinds of raw food (filet mignon, chicken, shrimp, veggies..) and you cook it right in the pot. Therefore Snobsdale ladies, do not complain about the food, cause you do most of the work at the table!! We paired this incredible menu with two glasses of Cabernet. 

I would say they saved the best for last. The caramel toffee chocolate fondue was my favorite part. Accompanied with strawberries, banana, marsh mellows and brownies. A chocoholic's dream coming true! Ty did a really good job!! I would request him next time we visit. If you're tired of the usual traditional place, go with the melting pot!! You won't get disappointed for sure! ;-)"}
{"text":"This place brings out strong feelings among some of my friends.   My opinion?  It's fun, and kinda gives me a \"I brought sexy back\" feeling because I hosted fondue parties in high school for my friends.  Back then no one understood fondue.  Now they pay big $ for it.  I was fondue before fondue was cool.  But anyhow.....

One friend believes that this is the most fun EVER.  She loves this place like almost nothing else as a place to have a girls night.  

Another friend thinks it's ok, but unless you get one of the tables with the pot inside of it, it's not so great.  

My lactose intolerant but cheese loving friend thinks it's the devil.  She blames it for having an entire cheese course in front of her for 20 minutes so of course she had to eat it.  And as someone who carpooled with her on that occasion, I agreed.

And yet another friend thinks it's the biggest rip off she's ever seen.  I think it went something like this:
Her: So, they are giving you cut up veggies and stuff and you dip it into melted cheese?  Are they special veggies, or just what you could get at the store?
Me: Um, just normal.
Her: And they bring out raw meat for you to cook yourself?
Me: Um, yea...
Her: And if you forget which thing touched the raw meat and you end up putting that in your mouth it's not their fault if you die because they told you to be careful?
Me: I guess
Her: And this costs how much???

And it was at that point that she and I were on the same page.  So it can be fun, or evil or both (especially the chocolate course!  OH YEA!!!) but in the end there is a part of you that wonders why you paid all the money and did almost all the work.  And for a 3 course meal, you could be there 2 hours easily.  Fine if the date is going good, or you are w/ good friends, but not a good place for those \"how soon will this be over\" kind of dates..."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for valentine's day. We were warned that we would be there for hours as the meal consisted of a lot of food. They were right! 
We went with the three or four course meal the restaurant was offering for the occasion, each course had a few limited options to choose from as it was the package deal. 
We chose and started off with a simple cheese fondue with a variety of deli meats and bread.  While I did not particularly enjoy the cheese fondue, (probably from the bitterness) my boyfriend really liked it. To each their own right? 
Next came our second course, I got the shrimp cocktail and my boyfriend got the salad. Boy was the sauce strong! But the the shrimp tasted fresh and was large and plump. 
For our third course we got a large pot of oil that came with a nice large amount of raw sample meat with a large variety if dips and sauces, such as steak, shrimp, heart shaped ravioli, vegetables etc.. I was in love with this spicy dipping sauce and had to ask for more!
It's important to note that this was all a meal for two, my boyfriend and I had to take our time as we were getting stuffed! We still had the dessert course which consisted or a  chocolate fondue with Bailey's liquor, served with a series of bite sized pastries and fresh fruit.
The reason I give this four stars is because after we were seated in the curtained couples booth, we sat idly for quite a while. We had thought we were forgotten! 
But once we got service our waitress made a nice save with her knowledge, recommendation on which meats paired well with which batter and sauce for frying, and the way she explained our courses with courtesy. Our meal ended with a nice little gift bag for a massage certificate, garlic wine seasoning, and a framed picture of our evening.
If I had the choice I would come back again."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of cheese and chocolate so it was a no brainer to come here for my birthday! 

Two of the four people that came with me tonight have never been to any melting pot, so it was new for them. 

We had a great server, Nathan. He answered any of the questions we had, helped the newer people understand how to order... we were all a bit confused on how it works out at first until the meal was presented to us. We had run into a situation where two of our entree choices may not be available. However he was able to get us the potstickers and give us suggestions as to what else to get. 

Overall we enjoyed our experience and plan to come back and request the same server again due to the great service!"}
{"text":"Celebrating our first date almost 5 years later! We love the romantic curtained tables and preparing food for each other  Our server, Tyler, rocked and we will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I came here for AZ restaurant week with a few friends.  If you want an interactive experience, Melting Pot makes you feel like you are cooking without much of the hard work of prep and cleaning.  You need to have a timing system for all the veggies and meats.

The service can be a little slow, but I think its done intentionally to enjoy the moment and the experience.

This would be a great date spot."}
{"text":"Great for dessert, but not so much for dinner.

Maybe I'm just not a fan of cooking my own food. Stab a piece of steak -- dip in pot of hot broth -- wait 3 minutes -- let meat cool a bit -- eat.

Holy moly! Don't come to this place hungry or you will starve. I was sad to see there was nothing on the menu that they could just bring out to you. Since I have an allergy to something in cheese sauce (I know - just shoot me now), I had to start out with the main course.

The dessert was awesome tho. I wished they brought you out all those bakery goodies + a big ol bowl of strawberries to keep going. There was a fair amount of chocolate left on the bottom of our pot by the end of the night. Since going to the Melting Pot, I have purchased their cook book and have made the chocolate recipes at home while setting up my own little ambiance (Melting Pot ambiance is great btw). Maybe I'm too cheap?

As for what you get for the money, its super pricey. Especially if you want a glass of wine. But as for the dessert, I say go for happy hour and have at it. 1/2 price chocolate at that time :)"}
{"text":"The Melting Pot won't allow you to book for six online and I think all of our problems began there.  We called in a reservation for our daughter's sweet sixteen birthday dinner.  Dinner at the Melting Pot was all she wanted. 

We arrived and our reservation was missing.  They nonetheless seated us, but I am going to be generous and say our server had too many tables.  Most of our evening was spent waiting for her to arrive for our order, for drink refills, to clear our dirty plates.  We were missing silverware for most of our entree course and couldn't find her to request cocktail sauce to accompany the shrimp.

I think the worst part is that this was supposed to be a very special dinner and the lack of service ruined it.  It would have been nice if the restaurant had bothered to even acknowledge it was our daughter's special night at all even with a \"Happy Birthday\" but considering we were missing silverware, a birthday greeting to our newly minted 16 year old was probably too much to expect."}
{"text":"What an amazing experience! This was my first time coming here with my family but it definitely will not be my last. Logan was our server and WOW! He is the friendliest server I have ever had! He's quick and very attentive! 

The food was out of this world good. We did the 4 course experience. First, we get cheese fondue and bread to dip it. We did the Wisconsin cheddar. Then we received our salad! After that was the entree, which was various meats that we can choose from to dip in the broth to cook. It also came with some veggies! Finally was dessert. We did the yin and yang. The presentation in itself was beautiful. I wish I had taken a photo. 

They all really go above and beyond to make this a memorable experience. Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"So far the best and funniest dinner I have ever had! Can't wait to come back! Unlike anything I have ever had!"}
{"text":"\"It's a chain. It's fondue. BUT perfect for the right occasion. I would give it 4 stars for groups or first dates. You get to cook your food so it is interactive giving you something other than your nerves to focus on. Pretty pricey however.\""}
{"text":"Wow ..... we entered at 3 pm and the 
Manager acted as if I did not make enough money to eat there... after the manager \"allowed\" is to eat... as we were leaving he asked us why we didn't\"tip\" ...... we left &80 on a $190 tab.... but the manager followed us oit the door . This was an embarrassing experience. If you're into  the tip reflecting your experience. We were sat next to toddlers and a baby... do I mind.not at all but management sucks."}
