{"text":"Awesome bbq platter with pulled pork. Recommended way above all the other generic food court restaurants"}
{"text":"Wellllll now... I say, I say Brookwood has some damn fine pit BBQ, with all the fixin's.  Y'all behind the counter sure do know southern hospitality.  I was holed-up at my gate for some time and got a reeeal hankerin' for what y'all do best... BBQ.  Don't get me wrong, now... all those fast food \"BBQ\" chains are good.  But during my recent trip, I didn't take kindly to imitation BBQ and needed the real thing. 

For all other weary-eyed travelers out there.  Make a stop at Brookwood.  You certainly won't regret it, you hear..??"}
{"text":"I just ate it. I ordered the bbq dinner. It was disgusting. The chicken was dry and the sauce was nasty.  I only ate it because I paid freakin 9 bucks for it.. The mashed potatoes weren't very good either..which is weird, because how can you mess up on mashed potatoes? The corn bread was really dry as well. 

The service...one of the ladies were nice..the other one was rude and insisted that I should get the chopped pork even after I said I wanted the chicken. I guess she knew that the chicken was nasty and wanted to do me a favor..

Seriously, I would have been better off going to Burger King..nasty.."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to great barbecue, however all we received was lousy service and lukewarm food.  The brisket was cold and dry.  The ribs just so- so. The sides cold as well.  The service was impatient and not personal at all.  The food has potential of being better.  There was good favor.  We had the sampler, however w/ that and the 2 beers the price I thought was too high.  Save your money for barbecue and go someplace else."}
{"text":"Hmm... I read so many positive reviews on this place that I was really excited to try it. I got the pat's pounder platter with pulled pork, beef brisket, added on ribs for 3.99 and collord greens and hush puppies for around $23.00, kinda pricy, but I was hopeful on the quality.  Here is what I thought:
Pulled pork - really dry, and almost crunchy at times... definitely pass on this if I had to do it again
Brisket  - pretty good actually, salty but good and flavorful 
RIBS - Never again! They were pretty much all bone, and so dry that I nearly broke a tooth! Given that this was a $4 add on to the plate I feel somewhat angry about it
Hush puppies - ok, nothing earth shattering 
Greens - really bland, although it didn't taste salty, kind of a shame, because a pound of salt may have actually improved the taste."}
{"text":"I had the brisket meal. The bbq was good, not great just good.  I got the mac n cheese and collard greens. Sadly those both fell flat on flavor. The hush puppies like tiny rocks, ok in flavor... dry. probably left out all day.  The fried pickle-- amazing!  
This was a good choice compared to wendys or burger king, though no 5 star steakhouse.This place was busy the entire time at the airport when other kiosks in this area were light or empty.  I'd go back and tried the pulled pork sandwich next time. I saw a long line of pilots ordering that."}
{"text":"Our flight to Jacksonville Florida was routed through Charlotte, North Carolina. Weird, right? I would have been more irritated by this if it weren't for the fact that on the hour-plus layover, I would have the opportunity to try some reasonably authentic North Carolina barbecue.

I should let you know: I'm a BBQ... afficionado. In about another year, I'm going to start calling myself a professional. Still working on brisket though - it's quite challenging! At any rate, I've been on this BBQ thing for about three years now, perfecting my slow smoking techniques, sauces and rubs... so I come at this review with a not insignificant amount of experience.

Naturally, I'd heard much about NC BBQ, and while its anti-tomato pro-vinegar reputation didn't actually sound all that great to me, I was still anxious to sample the fare that has earned the devotion of so many.

I had the pulled pork \"classic\" sandwich, which states that it is prepared topped with cole slaw. I had to prompt my server to do this, however. As any good BBQ afficionado knows, this is God's own preparation for pulled pork, an idea original to North Carolina and perhaps one of the best things in BBQ. I guess the masses probably don't know this, as the server seemed almost confused when I asked for it and of course, in my own experience, when I tell people this they almost universally give me a suspicious stare of revulsion. Until they try it, that is - but I'm digressing. 

Pulled pork is also remarkably difficult to screw up, so it's usually my baseline. I ordered the mac and cheese as my side dish as I will always do when it is available, unless it has the telltale fluorescence of the boxed variety. As a bonus, all meals are served with a battered, deep-fried pickle. Sweet!

As I suspected, the vinegary flavor of the pulled pork, which was very competently prepared, was off-putting to me. The taste of the smoked meat itself was nearly impeccable - perhaps a tad oversmoked - but the vinegar (I think unsurprisingly) leaps to the front of your palate and screams LOOK AT ME LOOK AT ME YEAH THAT'S RIGHT DOG THAT'S HOW WE ROLL IN NORTH CAROLINA. 

I didn't care for it.

The mac and cheese, while delicious, suffered from being overcooked and mushy in texture. The pickle, while a great idea, was not that good. It had been sitting around though, so maybe it's better fresh, but I think deep fried pickles are better as chips than as a spear.

In summary, I think perhaps the Charlotte airport is not representative of the best BBQ that North Carolina has to offer but I think it did reinforce in me the notion that I had going in. This vinegary flavor profile is either an acquired taste or perhaps just something that can only impress those who grew up with it. I won't give up on NC BBQ altogether, but color me relatively unimpressed so far."}
{"text":"I am  frequently on travel to Charlotte,NC for business reason. Each time I am in the airport, I will go to this place to have the barbecue. i love the flavor. For me this is the best barbecue that I had ."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite airport food in the U.S. 

I have sampled several BBQ items over the years (most recently the brisket) and have never been disappointed. 

It is worth a layover in CLT to be able to visit this place. Prices are a bit high, but not so crazy for an airport. 

Bless these folks. You're doing yourself a favor if you eat here before boarding."}
{"text":"Passing through the airport and had a long layover. Was looking forward to eating here as previous experience had been good. Today was definitely not good. My wife and I ordered identical meals. Hickory smoked brisket platters with greens and okra.  Brisket was 60% fat. In fact one whole piece I got was almost 95% fat. I posted a picture in the photos. It was hard to actually get the meat free from the fat too. My wife thought I got the better part of the deal so you can imagine what hers was like. 

The okra was burned. Greens were ok and the best part of the meal. That and my Bad Penny beer which was good but this place didn't brew it. I hope this was just a one off experience but I'm thinking I'm not going to probably give them another shot at my food dollar. This bad experience cost me about $38 and was barely worth $3.80."}
{"text":"Had a quick little stop over in Charlotte and was looking for food. This was a great pic. The turkey was the most tender and moist I have ever had. They have a 3 meat plate that was awesome. I have to say the pulled pork wasn't the best but the brisket and turkey made up for it. Lots of side options. And a fried pickle? never had one and it was tasty. Top it off with a sweet tea. I was nice and full with left overs too on my flight home.  Service was fast and staff was nice."}
{"text":"Gets the job done for folks in need of a barbecue \"hit\" in an airport that otherwise does not have adequate dining facilities for the amount of passengers. 

Aircrew eat here in significant numbers -- that should be recommendation unto itself.

THe ribs look exceptional. But this time (2nd visit) I could nto make up my mind. I wanted brisket and pulled pork so I opted for the Patty's Pounder.

The brisket was soft, and tender and delivered the full-on BBQ experience. Sure, a wee bit fatty -- but that's why it's so tender. The pulled pork was tasty enough, if not a hint on the dry-looking and slightly underwhelming side, but eminently good enough to finish the whole portion. The smoked turkey -- the enormous surprise of the bunch -- was spectacularly tender and juicy--hard to believe it was turkey.

Collard greens were a \"must have\" 

This was my second stop at Brookwood Farms Carolina Pit BBQ, and I'm glad I took the time to walk from a distant gate, [passed by regular gate C12 quick layover spot Phillips Seafood, and didn't bother with Chili's Too. Wasn't in the mood for the Tequileria etc.] 


(I prefer Dickey's BBQ Pit in DFW but it's not always an option depending on terminal and time)."}
{"text":"Meh, airport inflated price, got the beef brisket dinner, 2 sides and a drink.  Was really unimpressed with the portion size of the beef brisket. Had better. BBQ, it's the airport can't really expect great BBQ, was hoping to be wrong, might try the stir fry next door as I'm still hungry."}
{"text":"Got the pulled pork. It was dry. Mac and Cheese was average. Mashed potatoes were below average. Not anything that I expexted. Should of went to a chain place at the airport. Would of known what I was getting. Very disappointed for trying the local fare even if it is airport food."}
{"text":"This place needs to invest in some serious customer service training. Just witnessed the white foreign lady in front of me get accosted by two servers when simply asking for them to check and see if there was coleslaw in the back. As another white b1tch looking to get some BBQ that treatment was uncalled for."}
{"text":"Pulled pork was tough, dry, and vinegary.  Fries were old and soggy."}
{"text":"It's okay. It's airport food. Bland greens, I suggest skipping that. Beef brisket.. Well it's airport food, it's food, it's barbeque. It's better than bland airport pizza or other bland airport food."}
{"text":"Had the TJ's pulled pork platter with two sides, Mac n cheese and fried okra. Enjoyed both sides but the pork was pretty oily. Cornbread and fries pickle were both good, as were the hush puppies my husband enjoyed. It gets three stars because the main dish, which should be the best thing at a BBQ place, was underwhelming. Of course, I'm used to Archer's BBQ so it's not  fair to compare!"}
{"text":"Missed connecting flight. Might as well enjoy a nice lunch at the Charlotte Douglas airport! For airport food it was pretty good but a bit salty. Maybe too much bbq sauce."}
{"text":"Not bad bbq for an airport restaurant .. Have tried brisket, ribs, and pulled pork several times. Sides ok, better barbecue in the area but not bad for airport food."}
{"text":"The low ratings from some surprise me.  I end up going through Charlotte several times a year and this is where I always eat, and every meal has been delicious.  Maybe there's random bad service or food, but I haven't experienced it in several visits."}
{"text":"When you're hungry, in an airport, and craving BBQ - Brookwood is not a bad option. It's definitely not the best BBQ I've ever had, but I can say that it's not the worst. Had the brisket sandwich, coleslaw, jalapeno poppers, and a slice of pecan pie. The brisket sandwich had a healthy portion of meat and was tender. The bun left much to be desired. The coleslaw had a good flavor and the cabbage was still crunchy. Stay away from the poppers and pecan pie. Poppers were gross and the pie tasted stale and store bought."}
{"text":"Okay, i know what you're thinking...BBQ...in an airport?  Really?

Yes. Really.  Brookwood Farms does a fine job (for what it is) in the CLT airport.  They have a buffet-style serving station set-up and cut all their meats to order, then pile the plate up with the side dishes of your choice including all the \"traditional\" favorites you' expect.

I've eaten here twice this year, and both times I had ribs and sides.  Ribs are tasty and not drowning in sauce. Sides are also good...I've tried the mac-n-cheese, collard greens and fries.  Their cornbread is also tasty, but can be a bit dry.

Prices are reasonable (for an airport) and who doesn't like a little 'que when passing through the South?"}
{"text":"Great BBQ place in Charlotte Airport - so good, authentic
fast service and their sweet tea is amazing !"}
{"text":"Every time I pass through CLT I see this place. It always looks packed. Definitely smells good. Today was the forest time i tried this place after walking pass this place over 5-6 times within the year. I got something plain and simple, brisket sandwich and one side(mac n cheese) and a fountain drink. 14 bucks. The brisket was good, moist/flavorful. The bun it came on, over toasted/hard/cold=yuck. The mac n cheese was eh. It is what it is, I didn't expect much it is airport food. Next time I'll ask for a new fresh bun when I'm in line."}
{"text":"This place has good food, good service and they are really fast. You need fast at an airport. This restaurant is located the the Charlotte Douglas International Airport in Charlotte North Carolina. 

By the way this is really a super nice airport. See my review on this airport. So we were on our way home from Las Vegas and anytime you are on your way home from Vegas, your pretty bummed out. So being sad that I have to go home and go back to work, I needed a nice meal to cheer me up and let me tell you I found a super nice meal the Brookwood Farms Carolina Pit BBQ joint. Yes my Yelp friends this restaurant cheered me up. 

The Carolina's are famous for their BBQ and this place won't let you down. The food is already prepared so all you do is order and they fix your plate and your done. This is important when you have a connecting flight. We only had about 45 minutes between flight and we needed good fast and this place is set up for just that. 

The employees are really nice and seem like they enjoy their jobs. I got a pulled pork sandwich with slaw and fries. It was Carolina BBQ at its best. The pork was moist and tasty, the Cole slaw amazing and the fries crisp and tasty. Just what you need when traveling. I feel like I want to drive the 6 hour drive from my house in Virginia to North Carolina just to have lunch or something here, it's worth the drive. 

If you are ever flying through this airport, then stop and get yourself a great BBQ sandwich. You'll be happy you did, enjoy."}
{"text":"As far as airport meals go, this is one of the best places to eat.  Especially if you like barbecue.  On a recent trip to and from Texas, my flights happened to stop in Charlotte, and me having a love for barbecue I decided to try this place.  I liked it so much that as soon as I got off my plane on the return trip, I headed straight for this place in the food court.  I had the beef brisket sandwich, and it was really good with the sauce smothered on top.  I also tried the fried okra and baked beans both of which were good.  The only thing I think that I didn't really like about the place was some of the staff.  When I went there, the staff mainly comprised of workers that didn't speak english very well and were very soft spoken.  Just a small road block though en route to some good food."}
{"text":"Living in San Diego, and then moving to New York, I've literally drooled at every opportunity to have \"authentic\" bbq.  Sure in San Diego, you have Phil's, but that's not really bbq.  In New York, there's Dinosaur BBQ and Blue Smoke, but they are way too overpriced for such standard fare.

Enter this place in the food court.  I knew I wanted to visit this place because of a long layover and my thirst for real bbq.  I took a quick glance at their menu, very standard fare, brisket, ribs, pulled pork, et cetera.  I decided on a plate of brisket and pulled pork, as well as mac and cheese.  When I saw the lady behind the counter slicing the brisket with a smoke ring, I was as giddy as any five year old walking into a candy store.  

Everything now on the plate, I squirted some vinegar sauce on it, and proceeded on with my meal.  The brisket was dry, but it had the peatiness that I so enjoy in real smoked bbq.  The pulled pork was much better, but was chopped too fine for my liking.  Finally, the mac and cheese was way overcooked, but still complemented my meats well.  The sauce was also pretty good.  I'm more of a vinegar bbq sauce guy, so this sauce easily won me over.  One unique thing that they did give me was a fried pickle.  I've only recently started liking pickles, and this thing brought my pickle love to an entire new level.

Overall, it was a decent meal.  I've been so bbq deprived all my life that anything will a smoke ring will at least warrant a 3-star rating.  If I ever pass through Charlotte again, I will definitely eat here again.

{"text":"If you like overpriced BBQ with an extra slathering of salt on everything, this is the place for you! Even the sweet potato fries were bad and I didn't think that was possible :("}
{"text":"I've walked by Brookwood Farms at the Charlotte (and Raleigh) Airport probably a hundred times and never stopped. With three hours to kill this time, meanwhile, I finally caved it and was more than disappointed. A two-meat combo and a drink set me back $20 and most ended in the trash. This tasted like precooked BBQ and brings no value to anyone that's had real BBQ. There's no doubt good BBQ is tough to find in airports and you aren't going to find it here (you'll likely have to go to DFW or Austin to achieve that feat). 

Why was it so bad? Let's start with the chopped chicken. I took one bite and threw the rest away. This surely couldn't have been chicken (photo attached). It was dry, almost like a dried out sloppy Joe, yet worse. The turkey was overcooked and dry as well. As for the sides the sweet potato fries were clearly frozen and from a bag although the corn wasn't bad and the sweet sauce that comes with it is fine. 

If you eat at fast food places like McDonalds you'll think this is good BBQ, but if you've even been to places in Charlotte like Mac's, Jim N Nicks or Midwood avoid a bite here. This is even a grade lower than Sonny's BBQ Pit and makes Shane's Rib Shack look good."}
{"text":"For airport food, this has always been one of my fave places to hit up when traveling (when I was not sprinting through CLT because a sales rep dropped me off too late).  Pulled pork, green beans, amazing hush puppies, and cornbread. Boom. But ask for double plates. The food practically bends the flimsy paper plates!  Good stuff."}
{"text":"Why 4 stars? Because this is very solid for airport BBQ.

   ---   ---   ---

When you're at an airport, standards are definitely lowered. I fly through Charlotte fairly often, and must definitely attest that the fare at the people-mover-capital-of-the-world is uninspiring. However, Brookwood is a drink of water in the middle of the desert.

It's a fast casual spot, in the midst of a giant food court that's centered amongst all of the terminals, so convenience is a 5 out of 5. 

I went with pulled pork, brisket, hush puppies, a fried pickle, and mac-n-cheese. It also comes with corn bread. Clearly, I was counting calories during my visit.

All items were at least average or better. I don't like fried things, but ordered the hush puppies due to the feedback on Yelp. They were definitely better than I anticipated, especially considering that whole 'they live in an airport' thing I just mentioned. But I still probably would order for something not fried on my next visit. The pickle was definitely worth ordering again. 

Charlotte is probably the city I've laid over in the most without ever actually visiting. Until then, this is the closest thing to authentic Carolina BBQ I've had. I have failed."}
{"text":"I ordered the baby back ribs, green beans and Mac and cheese.  They gave me a huge 1/2 rack of ribs!!The ribs were kinda hard and needed more sauce. The sauce definitely helped the taste.  The green beans were okay and the Mac and cheese was mediocre.  I'm not a big brisket fan but the brisket looked absolutely delicious!  In hindsight I should have ordered that instead!! My total was $13 which isn't too bad for airport BBQ.  If I'm ever in this airport again I will come back for the brisket or pulled pork."}
{"text":"Loved the brisket and the sides. I got cornbread, green beans and the broccoli salad. The line was short and the service was fast and efficient."}
{"text":"You all let me down. I do not have high BBQ standards, but there was nothing special at all about this place. I had the pulled pork sandwich. It was fine. I had the mac and cheese. It was above average as a fast food side dish. They gave me a fried pickle. That was fun.

This is a place in the airport where you can eat food. The people were very friendly, which I appreciate - but I'm not sure if Brookwood deserves special recognition for that or it just so happens that everyone in Charlotte is pretty darn nice."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the bbq was so good I forgot to take a photo!  Over priced but what airport venue isn't?  Had the Brisket platter with mac and cheese, and collards,and a large slice of cornbread.  Brisket was tender enough my plastic knife went thru the brisket like butter. Not a fan of the greens however, they are clearly from frozen or can, lacking in seasoning.  Cornbread was slightly sweet and moist.  Quality was a pleasant surprise. Located in the main food court next to Cinnabon."}
{"text":"Worse customer service I've seen in a long time.  The menu said that the pulled pork sandwich came with cole slaw on the top and I got to pick 1 side.  The first young lady laid out the bun and then put the pulled pork on the bun.  She then slide the plate to the next young lady.  This is where the fun began.  She asked what did I want for my side.  I said I would like my cole slaw on top and I'd like a side of fried okra.  Man I love fried okra.  Anyway, the girl says that I only get 1 side.  I said I understand that, and that the sign says that I am to get cole slaw on top and then 1 side.  So I repeated that I would like my cole slaw on top and a side of okra.  She then proceeds to take a big ole scoop of cole slaw and then flop it down all over my plate.  She got some of it on the meat but most on the side.  She then slide it up onto the glass counter top.  I looked at her and said I don't think so and walked away.  Man, talk about having a bad day at work."}
{"text":"If you are flying through NC and want to try some decent BBQ, it's worth the stop. Prices are on par with others in the airport as well. The brisket was a bit dryer then what I like, but it is actually smoked and taste fairly good."}
{"text":"It's fast food, but it's pretty good fast food when US Airways (who is about to get a not-so-good review) delays your flight.  Would have been nice if the server didn't scoop a fair amount of water from the pork onto my sandwich, but 3 stars didn't seem like enough."}
{"text":"If you get stuck at the airport , and love BBQ, do come here . I thought the ribs were very good. Plenty of seating and even when there are lines, it moves pretty fast. Not bad, especially for airport food."}
{"text":"Typical airport food. Fried items not too crispy, mac and cheese pretty mushy. The pecan pie was soggy. The gentleman on the register couldn't find anything. Pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"I had some time to kill while waiting for my flight, so I thought it would be a good time to get something to eat.  I looked on Yelp and found that I was close to this restaurant.

I stood back and watched what other people were getting and then looked at the menu on the big board.  I knew I was in pork country, so I had to get that, and I also wanted to try the  brisket.  The 2 meat plate also came with a couple of sides.

It did not take long for them to get my food ready, and I wondered out to get my eating utensels and a table.  No forks were available, so I took a spoon and a knife.  Then I grabbed some napkins and headed out to the very crowded dining area.

After sitting down, I headed straight for the pulled pork.  I was delighted as it was very good.  In fact, it was so good, that I didn't take a bite of brisket until completely devouring the pork.  

I should have stopped after eating the pork.  4 slices of brisket were sitting ready to be eaten, and I went after them.  With the first bite, I knew I wasn't in Texas.  The brisket tasted like roast cooked in an oven.  It was very disappointing, but I should have known better than to get beef in pork country.  I ended up throwing the brisket away.

Would I go back?  I would go back for the pork but would skip the beef."}
{"text":"If you're originating from / inserting to TLH, then there's a stong chance you're coming through CLT (otherwise, it's ATL - slim chance of the other airports...) and as such, you're going to people-mover yourself right past this BBQ spot.  If'n you've got ample connection time on your hands and you're not of the vegan/vegetarian ilk, then I'd strongly recommend coming here and getting yourself a two-meat platter.  Sure, it's airport-priced ($15) - but hey, you spend that on a medium popcorn and a medium drink at the movies, so keep things in perspective.

I'm fixed in my ways and as such have ordered the same platter for years (pulled pork / brisket).  The sides never seem to vary.

For me, this is the only serious contender for my lunch-money in CLT."}
{"text":"Great choice in this airport for a solid plate! I got a platter of food that no joke lasted me 2.5 meals and made the people on my flight home jealous as hell. I didn't really slather my meat with the BBQ sauce because it was delicious on its own. I made the point of getting the greens to balance the guilt of the meat mount and I wish I had more because they were surprisingly not bitter. This place is a must especially compared to overpriced airline box food."}
{"text":"The bun was nice, but the pulled pork was so salty I couldn't finish it.  And the sauce was just really overpowering sweet syrupy.  Baked beans nothing special.  I will not be going back."}
{"text":"With a few notable exceptions (PDX being one), airport food sucks. It's a collection of bad fast food and off-brand, trying-to-act-bougey-and-gourmet joints managed by HMSHost or some similarly uncaring, vanilla, corporate overlords. However every once in a while you find something decent, even at an airport otherwise dominated by chains. Since I travel a lot, I have gotten pretty good at seeking out the diamonds in the rough, and this is one of them. 

Now, would this stand up against the best BBQ in the downtown area of your average city? Probably not. But when it comes to airport food, this is millennia ahead of everything else. It's assembly line, which makes it quick. The brisket is pretty tasty. The baked beans are good. The greens? Passable. Is it expensive? Sure. But hey... so is EVERYTHING here. It's an airport. 

This is an easy choice for anyone not wanting gross, industrial foods from notoriously gross fast food chains. It's actually decent. And it served me quite well. Do yourself a favor and skip the BK, Quiznos, and other garbage and go here instead."}
{"text":"Hey folks,

Keep in mind that you're grabbing a meal in an airport! How many other airport food court stalls do you think get rated on Yelp?? There's a reason there are a good number of comments about this place - if you have to travel and get hungry between flights I can't think of any other place I'd rather grab a quick meal! My annual pilgrimage to Alabama from MD takes me through CLT. As soon as I get off the plane I head straight for Brookwood Farms. There's NO good BBQ in Baltimore, so this is my first chance to get a taste before I get to Montgomery (and have more). 

For airport food it's pretty good. It's definitely better than any restaurant BBQ in Baltimore. But, it's not fine dining - it's airport fare. To be honest, I always get the same thing, so can only comment on the pulled pork. I get it 'Bama style, so have them add cole slaw to the sandwich. A side of fried pickle and I'm good for the next leg of my trip. I know I'm heading home once I've had one of their sandwiches. On my return trip I stop again since it's my last decent 'Q for awhile... Enjoy."}
{"text":"Edible, but not great.  The meat was not hot (barely luke warm).  The bread was toasted, but not recently.  Quite disappointing."}
{"text":"It's OK, and OK at that! It's an airport, I didn't smell BBQ smoke wafting through the air, but while in North Carolina - I felt it was my duty to indulge in some Carolina style BBQ! The brisket was a little dry, the sauce was good and vinegary as to be expected from this style of BBQ. The cornbread was also dry, but the coleslaw and garlic mashed potatoes were good! I asked the lady at the bar I went to, she said the pulled pork and the turkey are the really good there! Now you know to indulge in those things when you are passing through CLT."}
{"text":"Not sure if I was just hungry, but I ordered some baby back ribs (and asked to add extra sauce).  Just that was to die for!  The ribs were crispy at one end, and juicy & tender at the other. The meat was almost fall-off-the-bones. Added some beans and green beans and it was a great meal for $12. They ran out of corn bread, so they offered some fried sweet dough, called critters? Not sure. Anyhow, a good place to stop-by when transferring flights through Charlotte Airport.

Edit: I want to add that they have Southern \"sweet tea,\" but I didn't order it at the time."}
{"text":"As a frequent traveler of US Airways, my visits to CLT are numerous.  Yet, every time I'm there, I find myself pulled to get some of this Carolina Pit BBQ.  The Pounder Platter was my go-to guy, which affords you a choice of 3 meats, leaving the carbs to a minimum.  Brisket, chicken, pulled pork, it's allllllll good.

Nowadays, I'm more drawn to the ribs n chicken platter.  You're getting a half rack of baby backs, plus a leg quarter, choice of side, cornbread, and fried pickle (blech).  Add a gargantuan bottle of Fiji to the order and you're close to $20, for airport food, it's tops.  I do wish they were more generous with their BBQ sauce, but that's really the only blemish on an otherwise delicious record.

50 reviews!  Hi-ho, silver!"}
{"text":"I am a Carolina BBQ fan and this is pretty darn good. The meat is tasty and moist without the sauce and even better with the signature vinegar tang.  I got the two meat platter with pulled pork and smoked chicken thighs, corn and mashed red potatoes, with hush puppies. About $19 including tax but it's a LOT of food. 10\" plate is loaded. 
No alcohol there but I took my tray over to nearby First In Flight Bar where they let me sit and order a beer. I've eaten here one other time and it was good, then, too."}
{"text":"Great airport food!  I'm a big BBQ enthusiast, raised in Kansas City, living in Los Angeles.  I don't get much good barbecue anymore.  If I'm headed to the east coast, and I have to stop somewhere, I like Charlotte for the quick-and-easy, airport-food-court version of delicious barbecue.  Solid choice."}
{"text":"On a mission to try something \"local\" at the airport, we stopped at Brookwood Farms BBQ. It LOOKED great... Fried okra, fried pickle, pork BBQ sandwich, Mac & cheese, sweet tea, cole slaw. 

Alas, the meat was dry, and it didn't help that they were stingy on the sauce.

The mac & cheese was good, though, and I really liked the greens. (Though they were bland... I think that's why I liked them. Wuss.)"}
{"text":"Grabbing a \"to go\" meal to eat on a plane is an increasingly smarter tactic than relying on an airline who may/may not be offering something decent on any particular flight.  But airport choices are often limited to pizza/burger chains or fancy sandwiches that really aren't that fancy.  So while changing planes and terminals in Charlotte, I happened to wheel by this place and thought I'd give some Carolina BBQ a try (when in Rome).   

They've got a combo meal with choice of meat and 2 sides, so I went with pulled pork, beans and slaw, and they threw in a fried pickle and corn bread as well.  Up in the air, between NC and PHX, I opened the platter and the smell of BBQ'd meat, sides and cornbread almost started a mini-riot among fellow passengers.   The pork was well cooked, with both bark and pinkness, and could be eaten politely with a fork in the confines of an airline seat (ribs would be tricky/messy).  The sauce had the Carolina vinegar zing - with some heat - and the sides were solid.   It was like enjoying a really good backyard BBQ, but in the middle of an Airbus 320 at 35,000 feet.  

Debating great BBQ is like debating Pizza... everyone has their favorite styles and many will never be happy outside of their faves.  All I can say is this particular meal tasted great to me, and what's even better is that it's found in an airport terminal food court.

Which brings up an interesting caveat to this Yelp review...  I'm not even sure one can eat here unless inside the secured area of the airport.  That is, if you happen to be walking around the streets of Charlotte looking for chow, you can't (or can't easily) pop into this location without a boarding pass.  Likewise, if you happen to be flying through Charlotte (a major connector hub), you likely wouldn't have time to actually roam the streets of Charlotte and have other choices of Carolina BBQ... so reviews of this place should be engaged in this context.           

Bottom line from me:  if you happen to be passing through this airport, looking to grab something to eat in the terminal or take on the plane, this is both a good and unique choice.  It got an extra star from me because the home cooked style made me forget - if only for a spell - that I was crammed into a coach seat for the next 4 hours."}
{"text":"BF is a cash cow for its owners.  $17.00 for pulled pork and iced tea??  Suggest dining before arrival at CLT.  Carolina Restaurant nearby on Wilkinson is a much better choice.  So loud behind BF counter that I had to shout order 3 times.  Finally after check-out, there's no table left to sit.  Methinks not."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place so bad. Everything looked so good and I thought for sure it would've been an instant hit. The vinegar based bbq over powers everything. It's too much. I've had other BBQ pulled porks and beef brisket it wasn't as strong as what I tasted. Server was fast. I didn't like the fact I had to help an older woman because the server didn't understand what she wanted to eat. Once I gave her my advice she then ordered. But, after she walked away the server started to make fun of the older woman. That wasn't very nice. The puppies were spot on along with the beans. Fried pickle was good too. I had to leave 1/4 pound of the 1 pound plate behind because I could not finish. Overall, with service, food prep, and some pretty good side dishes. 3 Stars at best. I did want to do more but I couldn't enjoy the meats."}
{"text":"I was excited to see a BBQ place to have lunch and didn't mind spending more for my meal than I had planned for the pleasure of it. However, after my meal, I was disappointed. 

The brisket was very fatty, and nearly a full forth of it was fat. The collard greens were bland, nothing like what I was expecting. The mashed potatoes were boring, no flavor whatsoever, no gravy. It's my own fault for mistaking the flakes of skin for bacon. The sauce and the great cornbread were the only things good about this meal. 

I was also looking forward to tasting a fried pickle spear, which some meals get, but I guess mine didn't include one. 

This disappointing meal set me back $15 plus tax."}
{"text":"I'm skeptical of anything in the airport but read an article about this place and am delighted we stopped.  Delicious brisket with awesome bark and nice sauce.  Fresh, moist cornbread with just-picked corn flavor.  My son ate the mac and cheese before I could sample - he said it was great.  Reasonable price - about $12 for 4-5 oz meat, cup of mac, big hunk of corn bread and a fried okra or jalapeno - and did I mention this is in an airport, where you can pay $5 for a bag of chips!   We will be back."}
{"text":"I have been to this airport many times but have never been here. I am generally here early in the morning and the breakfast they serve is actually pretty good. Today I got to try the BBQ for lunch. It was awesome! I have been to many stand alone barbecue restaurants that aren't as good as this airport location.

I got a two meat platter with chopped barbecue and chopped chicken. Both were juicy and moist and delicious. The macaroni and cheese and green beans were also both good. The cornbread was pretty dry so I couldn't finish it. 

It's a little pricey, of course, but that's what happens in airports. If I am back in the airport for lunch or dinner, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Better than Sonny Bryan's in Texas.  No kidding.  The ribs were delicious, meaty and were caramelized.  Half a rack plus two was $10.99.  A deal.  The pulled pork: also good.  Did not care for the (very tough) brisket which was sliced, not chopped.  Nice, brisk service.  Free soda refills.  And the fried pickle was really good.  Honest!"}
{"text":"If you like barbecue, you'll like this place. In the atrium food court of CLT, but you'll hardly think of it as airport food. As good of barbecue as you'd have anywhere. 
I had the pork barbecue sandwich. The fried pickle spear on the side had just the right amount of spice.
No complaints from me. Normal portions of good food."}
{"text":"Saw a long line and walked by....thought must be a reason it's a long line at 2 pm.  Went back and had chicken thigh platter with greens, cornbread and fried okra with a fried pickle spear.  Enjoyed the meal and will eat here when I travel through CLT and worth the price and wait"}
{"text":"My family and I had to stay over night at the airport and everything was closed when we arrived. We were hungry upon arrival but, starving once morning came. My mother and I walked around to canvas which restaurants were open and what time. We wanted to have something that would be specialized in North Carolina so we stayed away from ethnic and big named fast food chains. 

We found out that the \"food court\" section opened at 5:15. We took a look at their menu and saw that everything was reasonably priced and the food sounded good. 

Unfortunately we really wanted to try the steak and eggs because brisket sounded super appetizing, but it was not ready to be served. 

We ordered one sunshine plate with bacon, a Biscuit and Hash browns for my aunt. My mother and I both ordered the country fried steak with hash browns, biscuits (asked for gravy top), and a side of scrambled eggs. I ordered the sweet tea as my drink and they ordered water. 

The portions they gave were very generous. 2 pieces of country fried steak each and 2 hash browns per plate. The sausage gravy was fairly good, but the chicken fried steak itself could have been a little better,but still good. The eggs were okay, they needed more seasoning, and I'm also partial to my eggs cooked over easy. I wish they had an egg choice selection. My favorite part was the biscuit. It was fluffy, baked perfect ,and tasted delicious, especially with the gravy on top. The sweet tea was also very good because it wasn't too sweet or bland, it was the perfect mixture. 

The service was excellent the people were so friendly and also funny!

I'm not sure if I'm every coming back to North Carolina, but I'd have this place again. I do want to try their BBQ menu."}
{"text":"Breakfast review. Had a long layover so had time to \"shop around\" ended up here for their breakfast and was not disappointed! They have oatmeal, grits, biscuits and gravy scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, fruit, Greek yogurt, country fried steak..lots of options and its cheap:) I ended up here because the whole food court area was full of people eating their food!"}
{"text":"Slop pork.  Ordered the Carolina bbq sandwich--which on the menu describes the typical spicy vinegar sauce. She put the sweet sauce all over without asking and the slaw on the side without asking.  Had to add the spicy vinegar at register. Ended up paying for a sloppy sweet mess. Meat itself not very memorable. Very oven mush. If you want good bbq get it elsewhere. Sandwich 10.50 with tax."}
{"text":"It's a sin to call this BBQ. I've had better food and service from a vending machine."}
{"text":"Brisket dinner
2 sides
$11

Brisket was good!  worth the $$
The Mac & cheese was so so.. I did t finish it 
The mash potato were good but not great! Still love me some BBQ Brisket !!"}
{"text":"Very good pulled pork. When I need a bbq fix and have time to walk to the atrium, this is my place. Mac-n-cheese and greens are good too. Never had a fried pickle till here and I understand the hype now. Damn good food, quantity and price for airport food. Better than all the other typical fast food joints CLT airport offers."}
{"text":"Not too bad for airport food.  The ribs were tasty and moist, and the collared greens were good, too.  Wasn't big on the mac and cheese.

Next time I'm in the Charlotte airport, I'll likely come back here."}
{"text":"OMG, this restaurant is what BBQ is all about!!!! The chicken is nice and tender, customer service is awesome , the sauce is Whew Jesus good.  Since moving down south this was the top rated BBQ ever. Wish there were more restaurants and especially one in Atlanta. You must eat the fried pickles those just take your BBQ meal to the top."}
{"text":"Ok for airport food I suppose. Everything is made offsite, frozen and then shipped here. They probably get away with cooking collard greens in house to say they make food here. Corn bread definitely has been defrosted, v dry. Ribs overcooked and dehydrated. Brisket old and Mac and cheese stodgy. Rip off."}
{"text":"Definitely the best airport BBQ I've had, and probably some of the best airport food in general I've had! 

Brookwood Farms is located between the B and C gate areas in the food court. The line was probably 15 people long but it moved fast and I was seated down and eating within 10 minutes. I chose the pulled pork sandwich and side of baked beans ($9.99). It also came with a fried pickle and it was more than enough food. I appreciated it that it wasn't too saucy and the meat was nice and smoky. They also have combo platters that come with additional meats and sides. 

My only regret is that the gentleman behind me ordered a smoked turkey platter and the employee pulled out a new fresh smoked turkey breast and started carving it. Oh man did it look good!"}
{"text":"I was rolling through one concourse to another to be nearer to my departure gate with a two hour+ layover in CLT airport. I was happy to find a bbq place. I had the pulled pork plate. Comes with a generous scoop of pulled pork with a slathering of bbq sauce on top. With it, comes two sides. I  chose green beans and coleslaw. I could also have baked beans, sweet potato fries, hush puppies, mac & cheese, tomato cuke salad as sides. They give you a piece of honey corn bread (which was good but needs butter) and what I thought was a wedge fry. Surprise! It was a tasty fried pickle!

Portions were generous for the price. They have various soda, water and other beverages to include sweet tea. Free refills which is great. I went back and nabbed  a slice of their sweet potato pie. I could've have just as easily gone with pecan pie too, but I was being good. It was delicious."}
{"text":"I have never had fried pickles before but now i am a fan.......A must try. Some of the best beef brisket i have ever tasted. The corn and mac and cheese didn't hurt my feelings ether. this is a must try"}
{"text":"My mom and I first saw the Chick-fil-a restaurant first after getting off our plane waiting for our next flight. After we got closer we noticed the Carolina Pit BBQ. The line was shorter and we figured we could get chick-fil-a anytime so we decided to try the bbq place. We did not have to wait too long to get up to the front. Speedy service. For a platter you got two sides and a piece of cornbread, because we weren't too hungry we opted for the sandwich and one side. Food was delicious and they piled the pulled pork high. Portions were good for the price. The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because the food was lukewarm. But other than that the food tasted good."}
{"text":"5:40am says my receipt, indicating that I was and still am one of those souls who travel out and in of airports at awful times, all over.  Charlotte has a nice, open, impressive food court which included this BBQ/Southern eatery.

Not every food outlet is open at 5am, but Brookwood is at 5:30 or earlier, depending on the attitude of the crew.  A life-saver for the hungry as once  you get into the A Concourse there are only bad, stale, greasy, cheesy English muffins and cold, too much bread, dry sandwiches at a small nook food outlet.

Brookwood serves hot, flavorful food.  Breakfast is eggs and meats, they even have some BBQ available, again depending on the operating crew's mood.  The other food outlets don't get going until after 6am, so we are thankful for Brookwood.

The A Concourse, the one I frequent as a Delta flyer does have a Wendy's and a hot bun place, but those open later and their offerings are not too great for a traveler.

Give these guys your business as a way of saying thank-you for being convenient to early morning travelers."}
{"text":"Had the pulled pork and brisket sandwiches. Was ok, but the hush puppies were over-cooked or maybe had sat under the heat lamp too long. The biggest problem is we both had digestive issues later.  Not good for a layover with a drive afterwards.  I wouldn't go here again for that reason."}
{"text":"After leaving Chili's in search of some food and decent service, we stumbled upon this place.

I'm no BBQ expert but this place was very good. We got the pulled pork sandwich and the brisket and both were smoky, moist, and tender as could be. I also got the fried okra which I never had before - excellent! 

Decent portions too. Yeah, it's an airport and you're going to be paying airport prices so one star off.

If you find yourself in this airport, this is a good spot to hit up."}
{"text":"Not a bad BBQ joint for an airport location. Pickle spear was soggy and the buns were cold but the meat tasted smoky"}
{"text":"Food, at least the brisket and mac and cheese was very good. But here's the thing: when you're in an airport, you would think they would give a minute's thought to how to do takeaway. Round plates with flimsy tops in a regular plastic bag does not get food from restaurant to gate in one piece. They need some square cardboard boxes, flat bottom bags, and need to put in a wet wipe (because this is BBQ, for G%d's sake). They would end up with more satisfied customers that way."}
{"text":"Omg this place is awesome. I literally plan layovers at this airport just to come to get bbq from here. Everything taste yummy. I usually get 2 platters. One for the plane and one for later in the day. Will continue to come back here over and over every time I fly."}
{"text":"This place is alright, but the bottom line is its still overpriced poor- airport quality food. Today I had the beef brisket platter and my 2 sides were Mac and cheese and fried okra. The brisket was a little pink and had a white hair in it so I didn't bother past my first bite. The Mac and cheese is pretty standard, and fried okra was good. I like that they throw in hush puppies and a fried pickle spear. After sitting down with my lunch, I remembered that I came here previously and ordered the 3 side platter, where I pick 3 sides as a meal because the meat is a little questionable. The staff was unprofessional... but again, this is pretty consistent with airport quality service.."}
{"text":"Airport food doesn't have to suck, and this spot in Charlotte is proof.

We had a short layover here and needed to grab a late dinner, so we headed this direction as soon as we got off the plane.  It's not the best barbecue I've ever had, but it's more than decent, and it's definitely one of the better meals I've had at an airport, and for a pretty reasonable price.  The pulled pork was a little saltier than I'd normally like, but the texture was great.  For sides, I had the macaroni and cheese and fried okra, and both were delicious.  My husband had the brisket, baked beans and mac and cheese and liked all of it.  The cornbread that comes with is tasty.  The fried \"extra\" turns out to be a fried pickle, and apparently it's delicious if you like pickles (but is an unpleasant surprise if you don't).  We also got a slice of sweet potato pie-- my first time trying it-- and really enjoyed.

I'm sure North Carolina has more to offer outside the airport, but if you're not leaving the terminal, this is a solid choice."}
{"text":"Decent option of the airport, I guess.

They have all kinds of bbq and sides here, so the selection is not a problem. I just though there was too much vinegar in the bbq. I know that this style of bbq is vinegar based, but I think my serving or the bbq from that day was \"over vinegard\". I know that is not a word. This is Yelp, not a vocabulary test.  

The meat I got was pulled pork and brisket. The mac and cheese side was decent and the fried pickle was my favorite."}
{"text":"This place exceeded my expectations of airport food and was a nice deviation from your typical fast food fare.  Brisket was a little on the dry side, however the sausage was excellent.  Cornbread was moist and the baked beans had a good spice.  I was glad to see they had some local brew for me to sample as well!"}
{"text":"I'd fly via Charlotte again just to get eating at the Brookwood Farms BBQ. The smoked turkey, greens and sides were delish!"}
{"text":"This part of the country mandates that a restaurant serving BBQ produce a quality product.  Otherwise, the owner is liable to get shot.  The standard is maintained even in the airport concession shops.  What I like most about this place isn't the BBQ which is good, but its the vegetables that sing out to me every time I pass this spot.  The veggies are fresh and cooked to perfection and oh so yummy.  

The service is quick and the food is hot. There are plenty of tables to sit and consume your food before hopping on that interminable flight back west.  Yet again I think I overdosed on the sweet tea."}
{"text":"Another day in Charlotte Airport and another visit to Brookwood Farms BBQ.   Seriously, if Charlotte was my hub, this would be my daily meal.  Love, love love the pork sandwich with coleslaw.  Skip the \"fast\" food at the airport and enjoy the bbq here - great service and great food."}
{"text":"Not terribly over priced for airport food a cold sandwich at the nook store cost $10 and a pork plate here will cost you $11. Your taste buds won't jump up and dance especially after they slip your runny pork on your plate with a tiny ice cream scoop but at least it doesn't make you sick and that's really the goal for airport food anyway right?"}
{"text":"It was ok.  The brisket sandwich was tasty.  The Mac and Cheese left something to be desired- pretty bland.

Decent for airport food."}
{"text":"If you are stopping over in NC then you can probably find way better food. Ordered chicken sandwich with side of Mac n cheese and will never go back. 

Roll was old, stale and crappy. Mac tasted like it came out of a frozen box. The chicken while not bad was definitely not good. I did mildly enjoy the fried pickle but it was no saving grace. 

Fail!!"}
{"text":"Had the 1/2 chicken & 1/2 rib rack platter with a choice of 1 side (mine: hush puppies), but also included 1 fried pickle spear & corn bread. Food rating: Average. Service rating: Average."}
{"text":"When traveling, this is a great place to get your Carolina BBQ fix. On my most recent visit through CLT, got the pulled pork and found myself eating all of it. Enjoyed the greens too. The fries and fried pickle? Not so much. 

And then as you walk away, the mystique wears off. It's still just airport food. Decent and all but you're going to have better BBQ.  But it makes for a better choice then most places here for sure."}
{"text":"Better than most airport chain food! Good ole' NC style BBQ."}
{"text":"I would not expect a Carolina BBQ place to have such a good brisket. Worth a stop every time I'm in CLT.  Sauce is good but the brisket doesn't need it and the fried okra really hits the spot."}
{"text":"I find myself in CLT about every 5 weeks or so. No matter what, I get the brisket. Sure-that's not NC BBQ-but for me, this is one of their strengths.

Usually I add on the mac and cheese and beans or else the fried okra.

Pro tip--you can a breakfast platter with brisket!

Solid-fast BBQ at fair prices for the airport."}
{"text":"I just ate their BBQ chicken with greens, corn bread, fried pickle and rice. The BBQ chicken and BBQ sauce were delicious. The greens were perfect. The rice and corn bread were just OK. My boyfriend's briscuit was tender and also very good. Prices were decent at about $9 to $11 for a full meal that left us both full. This is a good place to stop on a layover. It is quick and the food court like set up is clean."}
{"text":"Located in the B-terminal.  Probably one of the better choices in the airport.  If you're looking for relatively cheap food that will fill you up while waiting for your plane this is the perfect place.  

My Carolina Classic BBQ Pork sandwich, mac n cheese, and fried pickle was less than $10.  Can't beat that in an airport"}
{"text":"Great BBQ food at an airport.  I boarded my plane a happy camper.  The brisket entrée and sides were generous and delicious.  I don't always trust BBQ restaurants at airports.  However, this place is a MUST DINE if you're in the mood for some Carolina BBQ."}
{"text":"Not great BBQ.  Had the turkey, it was dry and lacked flavor.  The fries were also bad.  The cornbread and green beans were good.  Overall not impressed but it would do in a pinch."}
{"text":"After hearing a lot of positive things about this place, I figured I'd give it a shot this week. I got the beef sandwich with mashed potatoes and a small Fiji water. It ran me about $12. Eek, that's pretty expensive. 

The mashed potatoes, which I tried first, were quite good. Soft and creamy with some skin in them, just how I like them. Then I moved on to the sandwich. Can I say purple meat? Purple. Not red, just purple, Disgusting! I picked out the pieces that looked decent, and they were okay, not great. The bun was allright. The fried pickle that came with each meal was okay, I only had one bite. 

Service was fine, really not bad or good. Overall, I'd skip Brookwood and head to Bad Daddy's in C or even Quizno's next door."}
{"text":"It was ok- honestly I thought after reading reviews it would be better for almost 18 bucks for a pulled pork platter and a smart water. The pork was moist and flavorful with the bbq sauce. I got hush puppies that I tried for the first time and they throw in a fried pickle and cornbread."}
{"text":"Solid BBQ! I had the brisket with bbg sauce, collard greens and beans. The free fried pickle may have been my favorite thing! Corn bread isn't good, I'd opt for the hush puppies if I make it back here."}
{"text":"My dad and I were in Charlotte on a connecting flight. We decided to come here for lunch. He got the brisket sandwich and I got the pulled pork. We both got green beans as sides. While our meals were ok, they weren't anything overly mind-blowing, especially for the price even though this is an airport."}
{"text":"Holy crapola, get yourself a ticket just so you can TREAT YO SELF to the divinity of barbecue that is dished up at this place....located inside Charlotte Douglas airport!!!! I've tried a good handful of BBQ in CA, TX, CT, and SC, but um, this one was a melody of cabaret dancers on my tongue. 

The pulled pork is a super juicy tangy mess, the BBQ brisket buttery luscious, creamy baked beans, collards were ok (could've used a bit more tang) and ok cornbread. 

I've never been wow'ed by BBQ meats as much as the meat here. How crazy that it's in an airport of all places, what a disservice to the general populace!!"}
{"text":"Decent BBQ in an airport? Are you kidding me? Yet that's just what you get with this spot in the event you have a bit of a layover in Charlotte. Nice selection of traditional BBQ meats with a good number of very good sides, all of surprising quality given the fast food mentality necessitated by the location. I had some of the best brisket I've had in a long time, easy to separate with nothing but the cheap plastic fork you get in an airport. A surprising and welcome alternative to the usual airport fare."}
{"text":"Love the fact i could get some decent BBQ at the airport on a 3 hours layover.   Just OK.  We got the ribs and pulled pork.  Still like Memphis Minnie's in San Francisco much better.  At Memphis Minnie's you don't need any sauce since the smoked meat is to die for."}
{"text":"Solid BBQ. Picked up a pulled pork sandwich for just under $10. Steak fries were hot. Sweet tea was ice cold. No complaints on the food. Good smoky flavor with the pork. Tangy vinegar BBQ. A nice treat since Carolina BBQ is rare outside of the Carolinas. 

Worth the pickup for a BBQ fan passing through."}
{"text":"During a layover in the Charlotte airport I wanted to try something \"local\" in the brief time I was in NC. I spotted this place and decided to give it a try. I got the Classic Carolina BBQ pork sammy, which was decent but the BBQ sauce was a little too sweet. When I ordered I had to ask if the sammy came with any sides. The girl behind the counter acted like i just kicked her puppy. Whatever happened to good customer service? Charlotte is supposed to be the Queen City, not the Queen B---- City."}
{"text":"Awesome food,  had the two meat special with fries, Mac n cheese and cornbread.   A bit expensive but totally expect higher prices at the air port."}
{"text":"Really good! I got the 2 meat platter, opting for the brisket (I'm a brisket girl!) & the pulled pork since ribs weren't on the menu.  Platter came with 2 sides, a fried pickle & cornbread.  I chose the mac & cheese and baked beans for sides.  Man-o-man, that pulled pork was amazing!  It happened to be the girl behind the counter's favorite item & I'm glad I went with it cuz it was sooo juicy & flavorful!  The brisket was good too, especially with the BBQ sauce they poured over it, but by itself, it was a little tough & dry.  But still excellent flavor.  Mac & cheese was the weakest link, due to the mac being overcooked and tasting soggy.  Cheese flavor wasn't anything special either, but that's to be expected at an airport dining establishment.  Baked beans were good, again nothing special.  I'd never tried fried pickle before, & that was tasty.  Although I should've eaten the whole thing right away, as the outside breading quickly became moist & soggy also.  Lastly, the cornbread was just mediocre.  Kinda dry & definitely needed butter.  I also purchased some Sweet Tea, as it was only appropriate.  Nice thing was FREE REFILLS!!!  All that came to a total of $20, which wasn't too horrible considering I was in an airport & ordered quite a bit of food.

I was itch'n for some BBQ & this certainly satisfied that craving.  All-in-all, I would definitely recommend trying this airport eatery out if ever found to be at the Charlotte airport!"}
{"text":"I typically fly through charlotte just so I can get lunch at this place. The flights I take usually let me choose between a stopover in charlotte, or at reagan airport in DC. Despite the mystical allure of the ramen burrito at reagan international, being a passionate liberal means I try very hard to avoid being reminded of that guys presidency. BBQ makes me feel better though. 

My many stopovers here have turned me into a seasoned BBQ gourmand, highly attuned to the subtle sweetness of the sauce, the crunchiness of the fried pickles, the tenderness of the brisket. Sometimes I think back to the days before I ever came here, when I had never even heard of a hush puppy...who was that bright-eyed young lad? when does life really begin??

Or maybe I was just vertiginous and overly excited to find a non-chain restaurant after 5 hours on a stuffy fart-filled plane with 10 crying babies, who knows. 

Also, its in a really central location within the airport so its easy to walk to from concourses A, B, and C. And if you really want to induce food coma before your next flight there is Cinnabon next door."}
{"text":"If you are in the Charlotte airport and looking for Barbecue, this isn't a bad option for you. It is not the best BBQ you'll find in NC, but it is pretty good. I've only eaten their BBQ in the Charlotte Airport and I always get their pork and use the Vinegar sauce! Sides are pretty good, just choose what you like. And be sure to get yourself a fried pickle!"}
{"text":"When traveling through the airport in Charlotte this is a good place to eat.  The bbq is fine and fast.  The places to eat can be a little messy by that is the crappy airport design.  Ask if the fried okra is fresh before you order it, you will thank me for that tip."}
{"text":"I like both the meat plate and BBQ pork sandwich.  It's my favorite place in CLT to grab a bite.  The collar greens and Mac & cheese make great sides.  All the plates come with a fried pickle.  The service and food quality are consistent.  It's also quick if you have a close connecting flight."}
{"text":"Super salty BBQ, very rude employees, bad bad bad.

Charlotte has many food options but few GOOD options. Sadly, this is not one.

Airport prices meets dried out, over salted BBQ. To boot, when asking questions about the menu, the employees are rude and impatient.

Added a fried pickle to be cute I guess. It wasn't good anyways

Ugh. Will not return. Try somewhere else!"}
{"text":"This was actually decent BBQ for an airport. Pulled pork wasn't the best but it was decent. Corn bread was good. The brisket looked really good."}
{"text":"A good choice when in CLT. For an airport restaurant, they are actually a pretty good value and it's nice to have some local flavor. BBQ chopped chicken, baked beans and green beans were all steaming hot. Sauce was a little sweet for my taste."}
{"text":"Above average BBQ!
Pleasantly surprised, didn't expect much especially considering it's in an airport. Truth be told, in the realm of airport food, this place is a steal, priced like most BBQ joints, similar portions, if not bigger. $15 for the brisket platter with 2 sides and cornbread. 
Bottom line, plate clean, belly full, pretty damn good for an airport BBQ joint."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good and not just \"for airport food.\"

I'm not suggesting it's worth a trip to the airport (or Charlotte).  However if you find yourself here and even slightly hungry then this is a great alternative to standard airport fare."}
{"text":"Other than the atmosphere not being great, this was great bbq, especially for airport food."}
{"text":"Stopping through the Charlotte airport during prime lunchtime, I wasn't sure what I was in the mood for and there were actually plenty of options. I was a little skeptical of airport BBQ but after reading a few of the reviews, I decided WHY NOT?!

I went with a brisket platter which came with two sides. I opted for baked beans and fried okra. It also came with a fried pickle and cornbread. Trying to cut calories here, ya know. (Yeah right.)  

The brisket was surprisingly tender, to the point where I could cut through it with my plastic fork. I really like the BBQ sauce on top, as well. The fried okra was a little soggy, baked beans pretty standard, and the cornbread good. May not sound like the most rave review, but I almost devoured the entire plate and was overall quite satisfied with my Carolina BBQ experience thanks to that meat.

It wasn't the cheapest. For the platter and an unsweet tea, I paid around $16; however, if it's BBQ you crave, I would suggest giving this spot a try."}
{"text":"All I had was Greens, Green Beans, and baked beans, which came with a fried pickle spear.  I wanted to try out the barbecue, but just wasn't feeling it at 11:00 AM.

The greens were marginal.  They were cooked right, but there was just no flavor in the greens themselves.  Even with pepper vinegar, they were sort of bland.  

The green beans were terrible.  Way overcooked for french style green beans yet way undercooked for southern style green beans. The beans themselves weren't the best either.  To top it off, there was no seasoning whatsoever in the beans.  No salt, no pepper, no pork, nothing.  I get keeping pork products out, and even animal products altogether, but you have to give some sort of flavor to green beans, or cook them lightly.  You can't half-assedly boil them and plop them on a plate.

The baked beans were good, but not really anything special.  

The cornbread and pickle were very good.  Their cornbread is the sort of cake-style fluffy cornbread and was the best thing I had while there.   The fried pickle had a pretty perfect batter on it and would have been great with some sort of sauce."}
{"text":"Better than what I can easily get in LA, that's for sure. Still, my ribs were a bit tough, though the brisket more than made up for this. Their cornbread was just kinda meh...nothing special. Tasty bbq sauce though I had to dash some Tabasco on it to give it some heat."}
{"text":"I try to keep it healthy and if I can gluten free, but sometimes on the road this can be a challenge, especially if crazy hunger pains set in. Thankfully the CLT airport has a bbq spot option that suits me just fine! Is it the most incredible smoked brisket I've ever had? Ok, maybe that's a stretch...but in a pinch, it's a chance to have some REAL protein and vegetables that aren't all fried and fatty. I am thankful for this option. Service was speedy which is also greatly appreciated in the airport."}
{"text":"Missed my connecting flight at Charlotte to Alabama for work which meant that I was stranded in the airport for 4 extra hours. Irritated, I patrolled up and down the food court area looking for something to calme me down. As I walk on out, the smell of bbq wafts over. 
Ordered the chicken and ribs combo with mashed potatoes and cornbread..though i'm still curious about the brisket....

In any case, the ribs were a bit dry but they fell off the bone and the bbq sauce helped. the flavor-- I couldn't tell for sure, but It seemed like a liquid smoke flavor rather than genuine wood coal, bbq. The chicken was tender and moist which disappeared to mear bones in no time.

All in all, not the best bbq I've had, but it is definitely worth hitting up when you're stranded in layover hell."}
{"text":"Brookwood Farms BBQ served as lunch during my layover in Charlotte. I've been eating Brookwood BBQ for a long time, but never gotten it from one of their restaurants. It's always been from the grocery store. The BBQ was delicious. Light vinegar-based and requested a side of the bbq sauce in a ramekin on the side. The bbq baked beans were pretty good. The corn was really dried out, like it had been sitting under the light for far too long. You get 2 sides and a choice of cornbread or hushpuppies with the platter. I also grabbed a Smart Water and a cupcake container of banana pudding, which I've continued to enjoy today.

Why am I giving it 3 stories? The corn was dried. The lady behind the counter who asked my order didn't even wait for me to speak before slopping a bunch of bbq sauce all over the bbq. While the sauce was good, I didn't want it covering my bbq. So, she shouted with irritation and ordered someone else come forward before she started my plate over. I was exhausted from traveling all day and low on energy so I just needed to catch my breath before completing my order. The food was good, fast, and easy to eat though."}
{"text":"I should preface this review by saying that I believe airport food should be evaluated on a curve. 

Objectively, this place isn't that good. You could find much better pork outside of security without much effort.

BUT if you are trapped behind the glass on a layover, and it physically hurts you to be in North Carolina and not get some pulled pork and hush puppies, it's good enough to remind your tastebuds what they have been missing."}
{"text":"This is really the only place I stop for food during a layover in Charlotte.  I mean, why wouldn't you have Carolina BBQ while connecting in Carolina??  It's not the best BBQ I've ever had, but it's serviceable, and one of the better choices in CLT."}
{"text":"You know the food here is good when I was not even upset about having an indirect flight because it gives us an hour layover over dinner time in the Charlotte airport. The food was that good when we were here last. This was some of the best BBQ we've had. The brisket was just awesome. Mac n cheese leaves something to be desired, but the meat was just fantastic. Believe it or not..can't wait for our next layover in Charlotte!!!"}
{"text":"Rib platter anyone?  These fried pickles are so so good!!!  If I fly through this airport there is a 90% chance that I hit this joint!"}
{"text":"Sometimes when I pay for a sub par meal, I feel I need a do over and it doesn't matter if I'm hungry or not. We were in the richmond, VA airport and had a pretty sub par dinner so when we landed in the Charlotte airport and the lure of BBQ was omnipresent, I decided: when in North Carolina,
eat bbq. Initially the BF protested bc we already ate dinner, but I remained persistent and it paid off. 

We split a pulled pork platter and it was delicious. It was tender, flavorful, and not dried out at all. Definitely splash it with the spicy vinegar at the cash register. They have I think about 9 sides and each platter comes with bbq meat, 2 sides, and a choice of hush puppies or cornbread. You're bound to hit something you like - unless you're vegan, vegetarian, or don't eat pork or beef, in which case, you should probably never stop at a BBQ joint in the South. Also, airport food can be a lot worse (I know bc crappy airport food just happened to me a couple of hours ago). At the end my BF said \"good idea, babe. Glad we stopped here.\" 

Got a layover in terminal b or c? Stop here, it's pretty good. Best BBQ in the world? No but good enough to get you where you're going feeling satisfied."}
{"text":"Airport food is what it is, right?  You choose something that you hope tastes decent and won't bother your stomach on the flight.  If it tastes good, it's a bonus.

This place was a bonus.  In the middle of a food court-like area in the airport, they have brisket, chicken, pulled pork, and other familiar barbecue offerings.  I had the pulled pork with fried pickles and broccoli salad.  The pork was tender and tangy, a decent offering.   The broccoli salad and fried pickles?  I've had better.

Overall, a good option if you're in the airport, need a meal, and want something that tastes good.  Don't expect top-flight NC barbecue, though."}
{"text":"If are on a quest for the best BBQ on the planet and have come to North Carolina, good move. (Texas can bite me.)

If you decided to head to an airport on your quest, not so good move.

If, on the other hand, you find yourself in the CLT food court for some other reason -- like, say, you are waiting for a flight and got hungry -- then congratulations, you have discovered the promised land.

I have had a lot of food at a lot of airports, and this is hands down the best anywhere. Except maybe that wine bar at MSP.

Order the pulled pork; do not bother with anything else. They will ask if you want sauce. Even though you are in North Carolina, they actually mean some sickly sweet sticky slime because most of America has had its mind corrupted. (Did I mention Texas can bite me?) The correct answer to their question is: \"No, thank you; where is the vinegar based sauce?\" The answer to that is usually \"next to the cash register\" but sometimes it wanders off.

Sides? Baked beans and collard greens, of course.

You're welcome."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place out. Yuck! The mashed potato tasted like cardboard. Sour cardboard. That's the best way to describe it. Stale, old, dry, and sour. Never had a potato experience like this. How do you make potato sour? Really gross."}
{"text":"BLUF:  Great value.  Pretty good food and great portions.  

I got the 3 meat platter; turkey, chicken and pork.  It was all pretty good, especially the turkey.  It came with 1 side and i got the sweet potato fries which were great.  It was enough food for 2 people so the price was great.

Also got the veggie plate which was basically 3 sides.  We got corn (meh, no flavor or seasoning), greens (flavorless but they have hot sauce and vinegar if you want to make them better) and more sweet potato fries.  

They give good portions and overall the food is pretty good so i give it 4 stars."}
{"text":"Not what we expected.  Food looked good behind the glass.  Very deciving.  At first taste seemed like it was goning to be a decent meal but as we continued it became worse. If you just need a BBQ fix then you should be fine here. Or perhaps we are just spoiled from other BBQ places we've been. SORRY Caolina Pit BBQ"}
{"text":"This is straight up the best airline food I've had in ages.
This is some of the tastiest and most comforting food I've had in a while. P.S. Fried Pickles are hella good"}
{"text":"Food is good. However watch the person cutting up the meat. They weigh it and I saw her deliberately pick out hunks of fat to add to plate to get it to correct weight. And don't you dare ask her to remove the fat she gets angry and acts like you asked her to spit out gold coins!! 
I fly through Charlotte airport just about every week but they have lost one customer because of the way I was treated.  And I will make it my mission to tell others"}
{"text":"If you find yourself in the Charlotte airport, eat here! I visited twice and got ribs and a pulled pork sandwich. The fried pickles are AMAZING! Seriously, try one!

Very reasonably priced and absolutely delicious. A meal here will leave you feeling full and content.

Highly, highly recommended."}
{"text":"I don't claim to be a BBQ connoisseur, but I do travel a fair amount and eat my fair share of airport food, so I do know to have lowered expectations. I wasn't expecting to be blown away, but was swayed by all these other reviews. I'd say it was mediocre, slightly overpriced, but edible. I ate here once, and it was the first (and probably the last) time I will eat here. Next time I will go to Papa John's or grab a burrito.

The chicken was burnt see my picture of the chicken camouflaged against the black plate) It was more or less edible though, it wasn't much tastier than getting rotisserie chicken from Costco and throwing BBQ sauce on it.

The mashed potatoes and mac & cheese were okay - edible, but didn't leave me craving more.

Just okay, wouldn't come back here again. I think Salt Lick in the Austin airport has better BBQ food. Maybe I came on an off-night but I think I'll stick to other choices next time."}
{"text":"I love how the guy from AZ thinks he's a BBQ aficionado...seriously?

Take if from a greater Kansas City BBQ enthusiast (I eat BBQ 3+ times a week...yeah...I'll croak from a heart attack before 50, but whatever).  Half of these (mediocre) reviews are from people that got chicken, because they're east or west coasters who are either abhorrent  or oblivious to brisket and/or pulled pork.  Take it from a professional, if you happen to be on a layover here (which I was, for 3.5 hours...twice); this is the place to stop in at and get an actual BBQ meal that's surprisingly good.

The brisket was smoked all the way through, incredibly tender, and quite moist...with a slathering of pretty good tangy style BBQ sauce.  The second visit got a heaping helping of pulled pork, also slathered in the tangy Q.  The red potatoes could have used some more butter or something, but overall, they were still pretty good as well.  The cornbread...was cornbread...which is good, but not eye popping.  The first go round included some very tasty green beans.  The second go round had collar greens (a superb choice).  And the fried pickle was better than average.  About the only thing that wasn't great was the beer selection.  But it's an airport, so I digress.

This place is definitely worth the stop if you're a beef/pork BBQ fan.  And for those that complain about the price; burger king next to it wants $9 for a whopper and fries, why not drop an extra $3 and get a real meal?  Seriously folks..."}
{"text":"Wanted \"home cooked\" and this place did not disappoint. The wonderful smell of smoked meat drew my attention and I was well pleased with the brisket, potatoes, and greens with corn bread and a tasty fried pickle spear."}
{"text":"Three star food, two star service. I travel through CLT regularly and I've stopped here a few times. In category airport food, it's okay. On the service front, I experienced such a poor level of service that I felt a need to comment. It's unfortunate as I don't have an issue paying airport prices for food but in this instance, I was treated so rudely that I ultimately walked away from the plate and extended them the offer to figure out something else to do with the food."}
{"text":"So after watching some basketball we continued our trek to our gate.  We passed through the food court area and something caught my eye .... Carolina BBQ.   So I made an executive decision (ok it was a mutual decision, executive just sounds better) that we would share a sandwich.  It was a great decision.  The sandwich was just as I expected ... lots of pulled pork with sauce - and the taste of vinegar was not covered up.  The mac and cheese was very good, freshly made and very hot.  It was very impressive that it was so good in a airport food court.   They even had fried pickles, still haven't had one -- but isn't the rumor that we fry everything in the South??"}
{"text":"This is used to be one of the highlights of a flight into Charlotte.  Their pull pork was and continues to be one of the best tasting. Wanted to try the brisket. In order to get two meats you have to get three. Double up on one to be able to get brisket and pull pork.  I still ordered it. 

Brisket was dried and tasteless. It's like they use a separate smoker for brisket as it tastes bland.   Disappointed big time. 

Service is rude and not helpful. I'm guessing the only reason this place stays open is that it is NC and it's at the airport."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst BBQ I've ever had. The pulled pork appears to have been \"pulled\" in a blender then sat in a vat to turn into a mushy flavorless mess. The brisket was incredibly tough and chewy, no flavor as well, disgusting. 

The BBQ sauce and sides were very good but a place that specializes in BBQ needs to improve on their namesake. Really disappointing, threw the meat in the trash after a few bites.

Judging by reviews I'm sure they have good days but certainly they lack any signs of quality control."}
{"text":"Nice fast food barbeque for airport food.  I am not a Charlotte airport food expert but the food here was nicely prepared with good portion size for the price especially at an airport.

This is along the foodcourt wall isle that connects gates.  I had a brisket plate with corn and macaroni and cheese.  The overall taste and preparation was at better than you normally get an airport food court establishment.    You watch them prepare it so if you see something wrong you can speak up if desired.  I noticed canned beans -- really?  I guess some like that."}
{"text":"Not bad for an airport and a good choice if you're passing through and want a solid meal and a true taste of the Carolinas. I opted for the turkey on this day so I can't speak for the pork or brisket, but they looked good. The collard greens were fine and the Mac 'n Cheese was fantastic. The hush puppies weren't great, but the fried pickle was a nice surprise. The ladies behind the counter keep the line moving. Tip: Pass on the BBQ sauce that the ladies offer behind the counter and use the vinegar-based sauce down by the cash register. Drench your meat and collards in it!"}
{"text":"Wow! Ok, so I had no idea what to expect because it's at the airport and I haven't tried Carolina bbq before. It does have a vinegar twang but I liked it! The beef brisket melted in my mouth and was so deliciously seasoned that the bbq on side isn't a must have accessory.

My two sides were fried okra hell yes (not in CA) and the oddly shaped hush puppies bc I was also told they make it sweet here. The hush puppies were...okay...a smidge sweet but just different for me. The side of corn was okay.

Portion was beyond plentiful but I still scarfed most of it down since I skipped lunch, it was so dang tasty and I didn't want to waste.

Thank you for a great meal and I'll keep this place in mind for future CLT flights."}
{"text":"Brookwood Farms was a decent dining option, compared to typical airport and chain fast food offerings.  I chose the 2-meat plate with brisket and pulled pork, as well as two (2) sides and a fried pickle. The brisket and pulled pork were slightly dry, but tasted much better than I expected for airport BBQ. The brisket was not pre-sliced and languishing in a hot plate, but cut fresh off a big hunk of meat. I wished there had been more sauce options (or a sauce station), but the regular red BBQ sauce and a few dashes of vinegar livened up the flavors. I really appreciated that the food was hot, as I feared the cafeteria style serving station would lead to lukewarm BBQ travesty.   Service was efficient and bare-minimum friendly. BBQ tends to be a more expensive dining option wherever you go, the Charlotte airport included. However, I think Brookwood Farms BBQ does provide a good alternative to travelers sick of cliche offerings."}
{"text":"Awesome bbq! Who would suspect something this good in an airport? Had my first ever deep fried pickle, loved it. finger licking food for sure!"}
{"text":"Good quick meal in the Airport. The pulled pork is by far their best meat product and the hush puppies are good"}
{"text":"So far I tried this place twice and I've become a fan of BROOKWOOD FARMS BBQ/CAROLINA PIT BBQ. 
Their pulled flavorful pulled pork and BBQ beef  are excellent! I like the sides like turnip, broccoli & cheese casserole, fried pickle, tater tots, fried okra, etc.
This can be a great lunch at the airport and/or great take out to eat at home with your favorite wine or beer."}
{"text":"Good bbq that is mildly vinegar based with sone fine sides of marinated carrots & red skinned mashed potatoes!  Cornbread is excellent too!"}
{"text":"Great bbq for an airport location! Brisket and pork was delicious. Had a rough morning and they gave me and my husband extra hush puppies."}
{"text":"I fly through CLT almost weekly and even though I am a vegetarian I stop my Carolina's because they have good vegetarian choices. I typically get the green beans, salad, and mashed potatoes. All dishes come with a fried pickle and either hush puppies or corn bread. Tonight (10/25 @ 5:45 pm) however, what guests got was a side of attitude. Being a vegetarian the last thing I want to see on my plate is meat so when I saw that there was a strip of meat on my plate I asked for another plate.  The server slung the plate in the trash and threw my food in the plate. She served my meal with out the extras so I asked about the hush puppies and pickle and without saying a word she scooped up the hush puppies (no pickle) and moved on to the next customer without a word. 

My quandary is whether I go back even though I like the food.  I don't need the attitude this the 3 instead of 4 stars."}
{"text":"This is my husband's go-to place while in transit.  I tried it about a month ago and thus aimed for it on my recent trip.  Well, the line at neighboring Chick Fil-a was long, this one short.  You get a real meal for just a little bit more ... actually my barbeque chicken was 2 meals for me.  Three small pieces of chicken with yummy barbeque sauce and 2 sides - I chose rise pilaf and red cabbage - and a piece of cornbread and don't forget the fried pickle.  Who dreamed up fried pickles? Fresh, non fried airport food. Doesn't get better."}
{"text":"What do you do when you have a three hour layover in CLT with no reason to leave the airport? Well, why don't you try snacking on some Carolina BBQ for starters?

I've heard of Brookwood prior to coming to CLT for my short layover. Somehow I expected this typical food court style restaurant to taste and feel like a university dining hall. While they were able to definitely quell my BBQ cravings, I left feeling like I wanted more.

More sauce? More meat? Perhaps a bit of both.

I ordered the Pulled Pork Sandwich which comes with a decent amount of meat tucked in between two buns, which weren't toasted. You have a choice of two sides so I opted for the cole slaw and mac n' cheese. They also throw in a fried pickle which was an added bonus.

For $10, I would rate this airport BBQ better than expected, but still lacking some of that genuine BBQ punch I was hoping for. The bread used for my buns was very stale so I ignored that entirely. Pulled pork on the other hand was right up there, although I would have liked a bit more smokey flavor. Can't win em all at an airport right?

If you're looking for options, Brookwood should definitely be on your list of places to try here at CLT."}
{"text":"Service is very quick and friendly. Portions are very ample. Pricing is as it should be at an airport location.

Ordered a vegetable plate with fried okra, greens, and hush puppies. Everything was good, just nothing out of the ordinary. I don't know how to explain that, except that nothing tasted as if it was homemade. The greens needed seasoning, and the two fried items tasted like I had tasted everywhere else in the world.

The next time I am in the Charlotte airport, I will probably try the sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"Captive audience in the terminal and opted for bbq as this Yankee samples it at every opportunity when in the southern confines.
Decided upon the two meat platter because I could not choose between the pork and brisket. The meat was served with 2 sides and hush puppies and I chose the sweet tea for before mentioned reasons... The pork was moist and flavorful and the brisket was a bit tough but had a decent smoke ring. I chose sweet potato fries and baked beans, and both were average.
Ambiance is airport hurry up, and price was airport painful, but the alternatives were less appealing.
There are other bbq establishments in the airport so this one did not totally win me over, so if I return I will give them a try. This joint doesn't make the list."}
{"text":"Solid BBQ. The brisket was moist but drenched in a lot of BBQ sauce. The mac and cheese was decent. Fried pickle they give you was surprisingly spicy- fantastic. Not a bad place to grab some quick eats if you're waiting for a plane."}
{"text":"I've eaten a lot of airport BBQ over the years, mostly bad, even in Memphis. But Brookwood Farms is outstanding as these overpriced stores go. 

This is your best bet for dining at Charlotte Douglas. Located in the food court in the connector so its easy to find. The food here is so good I've even written Brookwood's executive staff to shower them with praise of this place. When was the last time you did that for an airport restaurant. And BTW, they responded with discount coupons so I'm very grateful.

I've tried pretty much everything here, the chicken and brisket are particularly good, and all of the sides are up to standards as well. Highly recommended. Airport Rating: 4.5 stars

Oh, one more plug.... Publix carries Brookwood Farms Carolina Style Pulled Pork at $5.99/lb. That is what I call a bargoon, and for a RTE its excellent."}
{"text":"I give this place 3 stars because it is in an airport.  Feeling hungry and craving ribs during a layover in the Charlotte airport, I saw this place and knew exactly what I wanted.

I paid $13.00 for a half rack of baby back ribs with sauce, cornbread, and two sides.  This is a reasonable price for baby back ribs.  Mixed review on the ribs.  The sauce wasn't bad - it was sweet and added nice flavor to the ribs.  The ribs, on the other hand were tough.  Out of the five ribs I ate, only two were moist.  The ribs on the end were dried out, and most of the meat on all of the ribs was difficult to get off the bone.

The sides were the best part of the meal - not outstanding, but what I would expect for macaroni and cheese and broccoli salad from a takeout restaurant.  The cornbread was also dry.  My advice - enjoy the sauce on one of the other meats (pulled pork, brisket) that is available."}
{"text":"Pretty good all tasty and nothing dry, The biscuit was moist, really impressed with \"airport\" food :)"}
{"text":"Better than KC BBQ - shhh!
We were running close on flight connections, ate about half and were pleased by how delicious it was. After a long day of cookies and pretzels, we both had the brisket. For sides I chose greens and coleslaw, plus cornbread. All were done perfectly - no burnt ends here.  We got covers for our plates and hurried to catch our flight, waited until altitude was right and tore into our delectable dinners to savor the remains. Servings were generous. It would have been great to take part of the dinners home.  The meal was more than I could eat.  This is a do not miss if you fly through this airport. If pressed for time, you can get it to go."}
{"text":"We were surprised to see a BBQ place at the Charlotte airport so we had to try the brisket.  Brisket is about our favorite meat.  All we wanted was the brisket and were a little disappointed that we had a choice of a brisket sandwich or a brisket platter but no just plain brisket.

We ordered the brisket sandwich and were surprised at the amount of meat on the sandwich.  It was enough to taste for sure.  The brisket was delicious !!  So, it passed the test."}
{"text":"Landed here this afternoon and not renting a car. Hotel I am at has nothing within walk so had to eat at the airport before I grab the shuttle. Not a bad place, brisket was on the tough side but good flavor and nice portion at fair price. It is the airport! mac n cheese pretty good, beans were good as was the cornbread. Fried pickle good too. Pork sandwich the guy in front of me got was huge. The staff here is VERY pleasant, as are 99% of workers down here. Wish that could be transplanted up north NJ where I am."}
{"text":"If work is paying again, I definitely would come back to this place. For $12, I had a bottled water and the chicken dinner with mashed potatoes (they use red potatoes), collard greens, and hush puppies. Interestingly, there were a couple of fried pickles with the hush puppies.

The chicken was surprisingly good, but the mashed potatoes could have used more butter so they weren't so gloopy. The collard greens were okay, but they could have used more of the meat broth to add flavor. The hush puppies were below average, but what else can you expect in an airport?"}
{"text":"Ordered chopped chicken platter and got pulled pork. The pork was salty and with the bbq sauce even worse. Couldn't finish it; however the sides were pretty good. Get cornbread!"}
{"text":"A little pricey, but good food. It has a nice spread of tables in front so one can enjoy the meal while waiting for a connection. Had the brisket sand & mashed potatos"}
{"text":"I can't even remember when exactly I found this place, but I've been connecting through CLT for almost 20 years now, and for almost as long as I can remember, I've stopped here for a quick lunch sandwich or a dinner entree if the timing works out.

Typical food court, grab a tray, go down the line and tell them what you want. Lots of different meat options, always delicious, and always way too many tasty looking options when it comes to sides. My choice? Usually the green and the okra. Hey.. this is the south. Live a little! I also almost always get the cornbread and love the fried pickle on the side.

If you have some time while in CLT, check it out."}
{"text":"Not bad for airport food.  I had the chopped pork sandwich.  Nice smoky flavor and moist.  The sauce was a sweet sauce with a bit of a bite.  They did have the NC vinegar sauce available for purists. The bun actually looked like a homemade bun.  Side of baked beans were nothing to write home about.  Fried Pickle was OK but it had been out of the fryer for quite a while.   I didn't try the brisket but I saw it.  It had a nice smoke ring but looked more like pot roast than brisket.  On the other hand, how are you going to serve good, fresh BBQ at an airport?  The sliced turkey breast looked good.  All in all, above average for airport food."}
{"text":"I do not recommend going here if you're looking for good BBQ. I'm from the south and this is not the best the south has to offer. Bad and overpriced BBQ. I ordered the chicken and ribs platter with green beans and cornbread. The ribs were babybacks and were over done, dry and bland. The same goes for the chicken, dark meat, a thigh and leg. There was no smoke to the meats and the rub was very sweet and lacked spices. The sauce that everyone complains about not getting enough is awful. Very sweet and very sour, it's like eating a sour patch. The green beans were overcooked and very soggy. The one thing I was looking forward to was the cornbread which disappointed me. The cornbread was cake-like but lacked sugar. In the end, I wasted $20 on cold, dry, tasteless, under seasoned food."}
{"text":"Whenever I pass through this airport I always make it a point to stop off and get a one meat pulled pork plate with mac and cheese and coleslaw and cornbread. Fried pickle is the best."}
{"text":"Brisket and okra are great. Normally a 4, but while stuck in an airport you can't do much better!"}
{"text":"This is the best aiport BBQ I ever had!  Got ribs and chicken that was really flavorful and tender!  Definitely would come here again!  I was disappointed that the corn bread was dry but the fries were good!"}
{"text":"There does not appear to be a moist piece of meat in the house. My baby back ribs were too tough and dry for a place that claims to specialize in barbeque.

Sides are almost the only redeeming quality if this place. Mashed potatoes with turkey cream gravy and turnip greens were just what I expected.  If I am in the Charlotte airport again, I would stop by for a vegetable plate.  (Vegetarians beware-- most of their veggies seem to have meat products).

The deserts were solid-- get the pecan pie. You will close your eyes and swear that you stopped at Grandma's house on Thanksgiving.

Service was about what I'd expect at an airport-- prompt but not spectacular.

In all, worth the stop-- if you skip their barbeque."}
{"text":"It's not true Carolina BBQ (the sauce they drench it in isn't exactly vinegar based) and its waaay salty. Opt to go without the sauce they offer you - at the end of the line there is Eastern Carolina sauce, use that instead if you want a true taste of Carolina Cue! Overall not great but decent for airport food."}
{"text":"For airport BBQ, it's pretty ok. 

I was stranded in Charlotte and grabbed dinner here. Plates (meat, 2 sides) run around $13-15 which really isn't terrible for BBQ, especially in an airport. 

I opted for smoked turkey which was pretty good but probably pumped with brine since it was moist but really salty. For sides, their mashed potatoes were great - really well seasoned, and they're definitely real & not instant. The Mac and cheese on the other hand is an abomination - flavorless mush which went uneaten after a bite. 

Dinners come with cornbread or hush puppies. I opted for cornbread (because I don't know what hushpuppies are) and it was moist, fresh and still warm. Meats are served unsauced and there is only one rather sweet BBQ sauce option which I passed on. 

The people working the line were nice, there are lots of side options, the portions are good and the prices are decent. If you're stuck in CLT and the Chick-fil-A line is 50 people long, this place is a good choice."}
{"text":"Your basic Carolina BBQ.  Very good, fast, generous portions. Not disappointing.  Would have been 5 stars if cashier had some personality or made eye contact or didn't seem so inconvenienced."}
{"text":"I look forward to eating here every time we go through Charlotte airport.  The food is delicious!!"}
{"text":"Every time I layover in CLT, I always stop in the food court in the main concourse to get me some pulled pork!!  The meat quality isn't top notch, but it still tastes damn good once you add some BBQ and slaw on top!! The slaw is yummy.  So is the corn, baked beans, and Mac n cheese!! I get an extra side for $1.  Kinda pricey here, but it's the airport, and this is the better food option in the food court!  Better tasting, not better for you!!!  Platters are around $12-$15, and pulled pork sammy was $9.  But what's nice is they don't charge extra for the slaw. 
I love pulled pork BBQ & slaw! Yum."}
{"text":"We decided to eat here during our layover and I am glad we did. You walk through the line and pick your fixings as you go. I was honestly grateful that the food was quick and readily available as we didn't have much time to grab a bite and sometimes the airport lines are ridiculous. 
I got the pulled chicken BBQ sandwich with a side of mac and my husband got a platter with hushpuppies, fries, and corn which came out to about $30. The food was pretty good. I was a fan of the mac as it was pretty cheesy and creamy.

Overall, it's a nice, hardy, and quick option in the airport. A little bit expensive but reasonable when you see what you are getting and comparing that to the other options in the airport."}
{"text":"I always hope the food will be awesome and every time I'm disappointed. But average BBQ is better than most airport food options..."}
{"text":"Our morning layover in The Queen City led us straight to Brookwood Farms BBQ, which was serving up breakfast at the time of our visit. Two breakfast sammies and a couple OJs came to around ten bucks, which was pretty reasonable for the airport. The food court-style seating area nearby was clean, the sandwiches were tasty (bacon, egg, cheese and a hashbrown on a biscuit), and with that we were on our way."}
{"text":"I hvnt eaten at lots of airport places because I think they all suck however this BBQ place changed my mind. Its great food with reasonable airport food pricing.

The BBQ ribs are great, juicy and savory sweet.  The platter was great too, you get a choice of three out of four meats : turkey (very juicy), pulled pork(a little dry and not enough sauce), beef briskest (juicy n tender and ALL That!!) or BBQ ribs (the BEST of all!!!) plus you get to choose a side, anything but the corn bread, its dry and tasteless. 

For $11.99 for the platter, its really filling and reasonable pricing."}
{"text":"Good food, let alone good bbq can be challenging to find in an airport. I've actually had better bbq at airports but this is an ok alternative to the usual chicken, burgers, etc. The brisket is right in front of you, so there's no excuse for complaining about fat. The brisket had good flavor and was reasonably tender. The sides were fogettable and the sauce was bland."}
{"text":"For some reason I get stuck here between connecting flights, an awful lot.  And when I land here, I've discovered that this BBQ joint (good,but not spectacular) gives me the just needed Carolina BBQ fix. 

Not being a true meat and potatoes girl, I find that getting a kids' junior meal is just right for me. I guess that works out to a normal NYC plate anyway. A scoop of pulled pork with the requisite extra dash of hot vinegar, smoky collard greens, a cornbread square and fried pickle spear is the perfect layover snack.  Best part of the deal? It is under $5. Probably the best value and cheapest airline meal you will find in the entire country (discounting Mickey d)."}
{"text":"The food is horrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's dry and you can tell it's been sitting out for hours. I work at the airport and tried this for lunch got the ribs and chicken combo. Ribs were dry with no sauce chicken was dry and Mac& cheese straight out the box! The fried pickle was delicious that's the only reason it gets on star! Girl at the register did not give me or the guy in front of me bags or lids we had to keep asking. Won't be back for the ribs or chicken that's for sure."}
{"text":"Great BBQ while at Charlotte airport!  I enjoy all their meats so typically get 3 meats platter for dinner.   Here for quick lunch, so got smoked brisket with 2 sides.  Love their collard greens and fried pickles!"}
{"text":"Had the bbq chicken sandwich with fried okra. Okra was cool but crispy. BBQ sauce was a little sweet for my taste, but the chicken was fresh and flavorful and the bun was soft. I would say this is a solid option for airport food!"}
{"text":"OH my LORD... Have merci on my soul. 
The veggie place is to DIE for! The black eye peas are,cooked perfectly with the rut amount of sweetness. The mac & cheese is just mouth-watering delicious, perfect amount of salt and softness. The hush puppies? Don't even get me started on the hush puppies! Everything here at the Brookwood Farms BBQ is made with a precise balance, EVERYTHING. I even ate a fried pickle for the first time in my life and maaan I'm LOVIN' it.  Seriously our next trip is out to the south were the food is good and the music is loud! ;) I highly doubt ill be able to eat Southern/Soul food in Cali now... I've been marked by the natives! ;)"}
{"text":"It's a good option when you're not in the mood to eat at one of the national fast food chains offered at the airport. The bbq won't blow your mind away but it will do its job decently. The employees seemed irritable and weren't helpful. I recommend getting the junior plate if you have a small appetite. It comes with 1 meat, 1 side, and corn bread. I got the beef brisket, which was thick cut. I got a piece w some fat in it, so I was pretty happy. There are a variety of standard bbq sides to pick from. I chose the collards. They were good."}
{"text":"Better than I sharp stick in the eye. Cornbread was good. Tall black chick serving has an attitude. Other girls were ok"}
{"text":"Really didn't think there was anything special with the BBQ at this place - the popular noodles from the restaurant next door looked tastier. The food @ Brookwood was lukewarm and there just wasn't that much flavor considering that this is a \"famous\" airport eater. I got the pulled pork sandwich, which comes with 1 side (I chose the mashed potatoes from their recommendation), and it comes with a fried pickle. 

The pulled pork was a bit on the dry side and didn't have much more flavor than its standard pork shoulder meatiness. The BBQ on it helped but they don't give you much. The bun was pretty standard - could've used some butter or could've benefitted from being toasted. The mashed potatoes were good considering there was no sauce, very creamy and well seasoned. The fried pickle was just a little weird. For a little over $10 it wasn't super expensive but it also probably wasn't worth it. Will try another place next time I come through Charlotte!"}
{"text":"As far as airport food goes, it was some of the best around.  I love the local feel and flavor.  Fast service and decent price (again, for airport pricing)."}
{"text":"Very good brisket, fried okra and hush puppies. The greens were a little bitter but still really good. We also got a fried pickle I guess they use as a garnish which was a nice surprise. 

The restaurant is very clean and the staff were really friendly and helpful. 

I would have liked to try the dirty mac and cheese which was a bowl with cornbread, Mac n cheese and your choice of chopped meat on top. Next trip through I will get this and review it. 

The sweet tea is dynamite!  Perfect amount of sweet. 

Great prices even for an airport diner."}
{"text":"Carolina pit BBQ.   Satisfied my craving for soul food. Pulled pork, deep fried pickle ,  greens and baked beens.  Yummy!"}
{"text":"It's BBQ at an airport.  If you're in the mood for BBQ while in the airport, well friend, you have pretty darn limited options.  This place is affordable for an airport, and decent.  Great BBQ it is not, but it's serviceable, and quite a bit better than your options to the left and right.

I went with the three meat platter.  The brisket was 1/2 fat; I'm pretty sure I got the end chunk.  The pulled pork was decent, and the turkey had a good smoke but was pretty dry.  They have one sauce option...yes or no.  Definitely not mustard-based, but recommended as it's not overbearing.  

For healthy sides...well, you're at a BBQ joint, so good luck with that."}
{"text":"Memphis. St. Louis. Kansas City. Barbecue capitals of America. You should include Charlotte, as we know 'cue here in this town and don't y'all forget it. So when you're changing planes here our very fine Queen City airport, stop in the main atrium (between the B and C concourses) and get yourself a plate of barbecue.

Yep, there's a line. Yep, it's totally worth it.

I got the pulled pork sandwich, which comes with one side. Mac & cheese is it. And of course, a fried pickle spear. You Yankees who ain't never had a fried pickle? Try it, you might like it.

They'll offer to put barbecue sauce on the meat. Your answer here is \"Yes, please.\"

At the register, grab one of those locally brewed beers that you probably won't find elsewhere. OMB (\"Olde Mecklenburg Brewery\") or NoDa or a Carolina Blonde from Carolina Brewery up in Mooresville. Maybe a little cup of banana pudding too.

And find a place to sit. In this instance, I don't recommend the rocking chairs as it's potentially messy food and you don't want to wear it.

Pick up your sandwich and dig in. If it's like mine, it's tender and juicy and tangy and delicious. Mmmmm... that's barbecue. Welcome to Charlotte. Enjoy your stay!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly better than I expected! The brisket was very flavorful and moist. The ribs were ok. I wouldn't recommend it. It's a bit tougher so you must must use your hands and get dirty eating it. The Mac and cheese was creamy. The food were not hot but didn't expect it to. It's quite expensive but very filling!"}
{"text":"The BBQ was ok. I like the vinegar based sauce, but the meat was lacking in yumminess. Those hushpuppies though! All my years with LJS and I thought I knew what a hushpuppy was. These have a slight bit of sweet to them and are delicious."}
{"text":"Very good pulled pork sandwich. I just wanted the sandwich though, and it seemed like I had to have two sides and the fried pickle too. Too much food!  Glad I didn't eat it all! I could've skipped the fried pickle too which wasn't very good."}
{"text":"Macaroni needed salt and was slightly overlooked, and the actual BBQ sauce on the pulled pork wasn't all that good."}
{"text":"Yeah I know I'm in North Carolina but the beef was getting cut right off the brisket so I had to go for it.  I wish I would've had the pulled pork instead.  While the flavor was nice, it was a little too dry.  

The coleslaw was ok but the fried pickle was excellent.  Definitely worth stopping for a beer and the fried pickles.  Plus, where you gonna get a $4 beer in an airport?"}
{"text":"I used to fly through CLT all the time and was pleasantly reminded why I didn't mind spending a couple hours here on my travel days. The reason is this BBQ spot. Its quick because its done fast food style in the food court but the food is delicious. Probably the only place in here with a line because people literally search it out.

I get the same thing every time - pulled pork sandwich with mac n cheese and a fried pickle on the side (comes with it). The pork has tons of flavor before you even put sauce on it and their sauce adds that much more. It's not my favorite style of BBQ sauce but no complaints by any means.

I think the fried pickle is my favorite part. Every time I get fried pickles they are done as chips but this place throws in a battered pickle spear with your meal. I need to look for more places that do them like this.

If you're in an airport with terrible options this place is a savior."}
{"text":"Tops the list for airport food...... Only root down in Denver comes close..... I had the three meat plate pulled pork  didn't look impressive but get it! It was amazing...... I paid a few bucks extra for pork ribs which were also easy off the bone.... Good seasoning and sauce I wasn't impressed with the brisket but I woukd get it again... I picked potatoes as my side edible but not something I'm dreaming about.... Three meats fried dill pickle corn bread under 20 14 if you got pulled chicken or ham instead of ribs... I bought sauce to go Carolina yellow was great the other one just seemed like vinegar in a bottle my can of the pale ale was 9 so yea I spent some cheese but it was worth it"}
{"text":"Got stuck in the airport on a delayed flight, and my ticketing agent recommended coming here when I asked the best place to eat in the terminal. I wasn't disappointed. I got the turkey, because frankly, I'm too lazy to make a turkey at home, and it was surprisingly moist. BBQ sauce was a tad bit thinner than I was expecting, but a nice heat without being overbearing. Mac and cheese was kind of standard fast food (think frozen meal flavor), but the red skinned mashed potatoes were a lot better than I was expecting. My corn bread was moist- definitely not expected. Hello, fried pickle- I love you. Staff was quick but courteous. Would return, though hopefully next time not for a six hour flight delay."}
{"text":"Eh...I mean you're in an airport you can't expect it to be amazing. Got the brisket...was tender but the sauce is too sweet, just not my fave. Wasn't horrible but dear lord it was SO EXPENSIVE! $18 for brisket platter and a water. I should have gone somewhere else for that money. If they drop the price it may move up a star just because for this much you'd expect the best. Unless you are really craving BBQ or don't mind spending so much on mediocre food then this isn't for you."}
{"text":"Like others have said this place is lack luster, but its airport food so little can be expected.  However, this may have been the BEST fried okra I have had in years."}
{"text":"Nothing can compare to Lockhart Texas for BBQ, but holly cow is this good. Traveling often, I've had more than my share of airport food. Hands down the best of all airport restaurants.  The brisket, fried pickle spear and fried okra was outstanding. A must have if in the Charlotte airport."}
{"text":"After complaining about NC BBQ in another review, I feel guilty admitting that the chicken sandwich here was not too bad. The fried pickle was delicious, firm and warm and just the right amount of batter. I'd go back just for the pickle! The price was okay for an airport establishment and afterwards I could enjoy the free wi-fi (and power source) from one of the rocking chairs. Charlotte Airport is not too bad, and this restaurant is worth a stop."}
{"text":"Good barbecue with fixings, however, the prices were ridiculously outrageous! $5 for an unsweetened ice tea?! Give me a break!!! Another airport restaurant rooking hungry travelers!"}
