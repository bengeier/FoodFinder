{"text":"let me tell you about this \"five star\" restaurant the Orange Sky. The view was quite spectacular and it had a charming elegant look to it. I know this because we had so much flippen time to look around. Our reservations were for 7:45PM and we were seated exactly on time. I was impressed. After we were seated the server arrived about ten minutes later and took our drink order (bottle of wine) and our food order. 40 minutes later the manager showed up with the wine. 15 more minutes our dinner arrived. My wife had the 12oz fillet of beef cooked to perfection and I ordered the rack of lamb med rare. It was raw. I sent it back. 15 more minutes and I hadn't even seen our server so I asked another server to send over the manager. She said which one? I said \"don't care, any or all\". The manager came over promptly and I told him the story of our visit and he apologized and said that they were very busy. Our server was responsible for our table and the one behind me and there were several empty tables around the restaurant. They sure didn't look that busy. Anyway, I told the manager to bill me for the wine and that we were leaving. He said I'll put two new orders in for you right now. My wife wouldn't eat until my rack arrived. I told the manager that we were leaving again and he said that he would comp the wine. This conversation with the manager lasted about eight minutes and my rack of lamb still hadn't arrived. We left and the hotel manager hooked us up with reservations at Ruth's Chris steakhouse which is where we should have went to begin with. We were greeted at the door and seated right away. Dinner was spectacular. I will never ever go to the Orange Sky restaurant again for anything more then to enjoy the view and have a glass of wine that will be ordered from the bar. 5 Star restaurant? I don't think so."}
{"text":"Not a Vegas steak house The view the ambiance and service was there but the food was just good not a wow Just a one time thing for me Was still hungry when I left"}
{"text":"My wife and I were visiting the Phoenix area on both business and pleasure late February 2014.  The concierge at The Phoenician said, \"Trust me.  You will love dining at Orange Sky at the Talking Stick Resort.\"  She was absolutely correct!  Our waiter, Tom, patiently went through every item on the menu for us, and he steered us safely to harbor on everything we ordered.  The service was precise, and professional, and friendly as well. Quite the combination.  And the food was perfectly prepared, and delicious.  Large portions and very tasty, every single item.  Recommendation:  Order less than you might think you need, or you will leave stuffed.  And then there was the sunset.  Oh, my.  God was all over that orange sky that night.  Gorgeous.  We were saying \"Oooooooh, look at it now!\" every three minutes.  Really, this is a memorable place.  If you are in the area, go.  Jack Thompson, Miami, Florida"}
{"text":"The food was great but the service was horrendous! Lorraine was totally rude and had a disgusting attitude ! I will NOT be back"}
{"text":"Had reservations and the place was practically empty. Asked for a table near the window since it was our 20th anniversary. Said they could not do it.  However, after being seated, they seated a couple with a young child at a window table. The fear is very good but expensive for what you get. The service is very good."}
{"text":"Listen. I am fine with a dress code at a respectable establishment. Especially when the majority of the people down stairs are in flip flops and tee shirts ... BUT They turned us away because one of us did not have a \"collar shirt\". However he did. I tried to explain to the goon bouncer that it was a mandarin style collar which just happens to be different then the standard turn over collar but IS in fact a COLLAR. Dress code beware. They will judge your collar even if they don't know anything about it .  This was the second time  I brought out of town people across town to enjoy the bar on the top floor and they turn us away because one of my guests was not up to their standards.  I have been in Orange Sky a hand full of other times with no problem, but won't bother going back there because I don't  want to \"gamble,\" on getting in."}
{"text":"Wow,  I never give 5 stars but this place deserves it. I went with one of my friend's foodies groups and it was an amazing experience.   The views are beautiful at every angle of the restaurant from the bar to the main dinning areas. The sunset was absolutely gorgeous while we ate our delectable meals. I did not drink any alcohol while there, but my foodie friends loved their glasses of fine wine. The french pressed coffee and their deserts looked and smelled amazing as well, although I did not partake because I was absolutely stuffed.  I had the Red Chile Beef Tips as my main entree with two sides: The Kale and  mushroom  and the asparagus.   I would love to go back and enjoy something different next time. Each person at the table ordered one of the appetizers and they were all delectable in their own ways.  I am a fan!!  Love,  The East Coast Foodie"}
{"text":"We had Christmas eve dinner here and it was wonderful. The shellfish platter was delicious and the ribeye was cooked perfectly. We also had the lobster bisque and several of the desserts were sampled as well as the sauces. Wait staff was very attentive and professional. We also were fortunate enough to have one of the seven private booths that put the whole experience over the top. We had a wonderful time and would surely go back again on the next visit to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I took clients here from a conference I was attending. The restaurant has a very good reputation with spectacular views. I dine across the country and take out clients as well. From my experience this is probably a three star restaurant. For entr√©es, we ordered steaks and one person ordered scallops with shrimp which  he said was excellent. I had the New York strip which I would say was average. I have had better steaks for less money. One person said the tenderloin was very good. Perhaps the most disappointing part of the meal were the side's. They are served sort of family style with portions for two people. We ordered potatoes, Brentwood corn, and asparagus. They all were good but I can say the portions were fairly light. For dessert we had the cheesecake and the raspberries with cake. I think they both were good. Our total bill including tip for three was over $200."}
{"text":"Good food but misses the mark overall. Bathrooms are horrible, 2 single stall unisex ones that have long lines even at slow times. Service is slow. Seating for many people is awful , where we were lined up  in a picnic table like row of tables with half of the seats facing the butts of people at the bar.  Food is good but expensive . Rib Eye is $40, scallops are $9 ea.   One time was enough for me."}
{"text":"Next to Kai, also on a reservation, the best dinner going. Beautiful view, great service, and great food. Not cheap but excellent for special occasions. From now on it will be my traditional Easter Elk dinner. Good Manhattan also. And good wine list."}
{"text":"Max the bartender was fantastic!  Amazing food, drinks, views of Phoenix and an excellent place for my wife's birthday."}
{"text":"Nice view, but overall a major disappointment past the appetizer   Starter: Agave-Chile Beef Tenderlion - very good, unfortunately it was on the smaller side.   Plate #1: Rib-eye steak - worst steak he has have ever eaten. There was an extreme amount of tasteless fat and appeared to be lower quality beef. The seasoning could not mask the underwhelming flavor of the meat.   Enhancement: shrimp and Scallop steak - very good. Wish we got only the starter and a few of these.   Plate #2: New York Strp: More tasteful than the rib-eye but only slightly. Again, lacked flavor and had terrible presentation. Served on a huge plate with NOTHING else on the dish. Just the pure sight of the dish had us both saying \"something is missing\"   Accompaniments: asparagus, garlic butter, lemon zest. Again, very disappointed. Lacked flavor and did not taste fresh.   The server also never asked how the meal was or if we needed anything else (other than drinks)  Lastly, when I called to confirm the reservation, the staff asked if we were celebrating anything special. I let them know we were celebrating a major work promotion (plenty of other yelp reviews had mentioned how the restaurant did little extra things for their celebrations). They did nothing for us so that was a little disappointing as well. I would not have even mentioned the promotion, but since they asked I was shocked nothing was done.   Safe to say, we will not be dinning at Orange Sky again."}
{"text":"The evening started out poorly as we had to wait to be seated and when we finally did get seated, there were lots of empty tables.  The host was not able to tell us how long the wait would be.  Why couldn't he tell us???  That being said, the seater was friendly, the service was great, the food was excellent and it was a lovely evening.  Would have been a 5 star without the incompetent host."}
{"text":"Wonderful dining experience. Food quality and restaurant atmosphere are top of the line. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"What a lovely experience. We splurged on a sunset booth to celebrate our wedding anniversary. There is a minimum charge to be seated in a private booth but that cost can be easily met. Yes, it's expensive, but oh my goodness, well worth the price. The booth is comfy and private and the window curtains are opened just before sunset (or you would be staring into the sun). We shared a bottle of lovely wine while Julio, our server, described the various menu options and fielded our questions. Service is perfect. We had the elk loin for 2 served Oscar style and it was delicious. The portions were very generous. We had a big bag of food to take home. Highly recommend this. Amazing view, food, service and atmosphere. Oh, and the wine list is great."}
{"text":"This is always one of my favorite stops in Arizona, the food and service not to mention the view is spectacular."}
{"text":"They made my husbands 50th birthday very special, food was amazing. Great mixologists and the staff went out of there way to make our night so special!"}
{"text":"I had a large (25 person) dinner here recently and it was wonderful.  Food was excellent, service was beyond great, views were nice (including having shades drawn during daylight that were raised as soon as the sun dipped behind the mountains) and overall great atmosphere.  They even accommodated our quirky requests for bar drinks, letting us take over the reception area and patio, etc.  The only thing that could have possibly been improved was the price (it was a bit high but not unexpectedly so) and some wine recommendations (they have a great wine list, but no sommelier).  There are some adorable tables on the side of the restaurant surrounded by sheer curtains so you can have a view and privacy, I can't wait to go back and eat at one of those tables.  I highly recommend this place for a big group, they made everything easy and memorable. Given the views and the good food, this is also a great place for a fancy date night."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, awesome service great main dish, poor sides. I had the salmon, it was amazing my husband had the steak, also amazing but the garlic fries are more like a whole potato than fries and the cracked potato was blah. Will certainly go back and try something new"}
{"text":"Love getting away from the casino floor to the \"O\" Lounge. It's relaxed and classy. Last weekend I just sat at the bar and had the most delightful service from the bartender that was working there (Kyle I believe his name was-tall, thin, late thirties). I find most of the staff at Talking Stick to be pretty rude and not genuinely interested. So it was a breath of fresh air to know you have people like him working there. Attentive, friendly, and well knowledged about everything you serve-and it was super busy. I will definitely be back. Atmosphere, food, and drinks up there are amazing!"}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed a wonderful Anniversary dinner at Orange Sky restaurant in the Talking Stick Resort. The service was very professional (thank you Mike), including a complimentary \"Happy Anniversary\" dessert (delicious). My husband had the Scallops and I had the Crab legs. Both were outstanding. I had read bad reviews on a few sites but we were very pleased with our evening- including a beautiful sunset and Arizona night sky."}
{"text":"After reading other reviews our party of 5 was hesitant about keeping our dinner reservations. However, we decided to keep it and be our own critics and we're so glad we did! The atmosphere, food and service were superb! You should expect to pay a little more when you have such a great dining experience. Great food, stunning view and fabulous service! As the saying goes, \"you cannot always judge a book by it's cover!\" We are definitely looking forward to our next visit"}
{"text":"We got a private booth for my girlfriend's birthday and my marriage proposal to her.  The sunset was awesome.  The wait staff was very friendly and attentive.  I love a place that keeps filling up  the water glasses, without us having to ask.  I had the Elk Loin, and my girlfriend/fiancee had the beef tenderloin.  Both were delicious, as were the crushed parmesan potato, and the corn/chard/bacon/asparagus sides. The views from the patio, with the city lights and the mountains in the background were spectacular.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"my bf & i came here for dinner and it was perfect. it was so romantic. youre up on the 14th floor of the resort (Talking Stick Resort & Casino) seated in these huge comfy sofas that face the floor to ceiling windows that over-look the landscape. (unfortunately it was 10pm & we didnt quite catch the amazing sunset that everyone there talks about). the seating area is private - separated by curtains so you dont see the diners next to you & the backs of the sofas are so high that people passing the hallway behind you cant look at you eating.   the staff was friendly & knowledgable. drink/wine selection was plentiful & the food excelent. we got steak & king crab legs as well as a lobster bisque to start with. the side of mashed potatoes was enough to feed 4 ppl & there was sadly no room left for dessert."}
{"text":"Here's the headline: Ask for Julio to be your server if you want a phenomenal dining experience. Julio made dinner even more awesome. From the moment he came to our table to introduce himself, we knew we were going to have an amazing night.  Now, the rest of my review.  The location of Orange Sky is awesome. The view of the valley of the sun from the perch atop the Talking Stick Resort is spectacular. To avoid walking through the smoke filled casino, try to park on the north side of the resort, not the side that faces Talking Stick Way. You will shave a 10 minute walk through the mindless, hypnotized gambling people.   For special date nights, i'd recommend making reservations for one of the private sweetheart tables. The atmosphere is super romantic the view is as mentioned above and you have total privacy while you dine. There is a $200 meal minimum, easily met if you order appetizers, drinks, bottle of wine, etc.  Let's talk about the food. Was it good? Yes. Was it great? No. On a scale of 1 to 10, I give the food an eight or nine. Have I had better steaks? Yes. Have I had better side dishes? Sure. But, food is very subjective. The food was high-quality, tasty, prepared perfectly, and exactly what you would expect from a high-quality, high-end restaurant.   We started with a prickly pear, crusted, shrimp for an appetizer or. My wife ordered some exotic margarita and I ordered an old fashion.   She ordered some market price cut of beef that I had never heard of, nor can I pronounce. It came out rare as she ordered it, it was tender as can be without being Kobe beef. I got a perfectly cooked ribeye. We shared the sweet potato and goat cheese side dish with maple bourbon. We also had a great bottle of Pinot Noir from New Zealand. We finished it off with a lemon curd cheesecake and two French pressed coffee's. Our dinner came out to $207 and was worth every bit of it. We tipped Julio on the bill total and rounded it up to 25% as he alone increased the enjoyment of our dinner immensely.   What makes the experience at Orange Sky is a combination of all of the above elements. When you start with the sweetheart table, and Julio as your server, order a terrific meal with good wine, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"What an absolutely incredible experience! Orange Sky is located on the 15th floor of the Talking Stick Resort. A private elevator whisks you upstairs, whereupon you are greeted by smiles and hellos by *every single person* with whom you come into contact. The staff is one of the friendliest and professional we've ever encountered. Great job, guys!! This is so important and so overlooked by other places!  So glad we made reservations on a Saturday night. We made our decision to go there in the afternoon so when we went to make the reservation, only 5:45pm or 9pm were available. Sunset was at 7:41 that night, so we went with the 5:45pm reservation. We wound up arriving late--a little after 6pm--but we were seated immediately.  It turned out that many other tables were available at that time, so if you go early without a reservation you'll probably get seated.  It didn't matter that we were early for the sunset, though. 6pm turned out to be the perfect time to enjoy the changing colors of the sky. And *that* is why I'm glad we made a reservation...because by being forced to go at 5:45 (in our ignorance we would have made a later reservation) we were able to fully enjoy the sky. The sun actually dropped completely at 7:41, leaving us with only light left until well after 8pm--no colors, so keep that in mind when calculating this! (Also, remember sunset changes during the year, depending on the season). We went one of the longest days of the year.  The space itself is unique. A modern main lounge area up front--with curved, modular seating and window views all around --further expands into another area where a piano sits. This area has additional seating and a dance floor.  You'll find the restaurant itself at the end of the long corridor. This hallway is flanked on one side by private tables with westward views, and on the other by two private party rooms and their state of the art kitchen.  Entering the main dining room for the first time is a treat for those who are already jaded by most high end restaurants. The room is vast, but warm and inviting, with a fireplace centered on the back wall. The 270' view is amazing. You can even dine or take drinks outside on the lavishly furnished patio. If you're lucky you'll see a glimpse of wild stallions running through the reservation  toward the east side. You can dress up here and ENJOY it. It is worth the effort.  The food here is stellar. We both had the Chilean sea bass, and shared sides of corn with chard, and green chile mashed potatoes. The bass was cooked sparingly and to absolute perfection, which delighted our server when we told him. (He said that many people expect it to be cooked more--which ruins the delicate texture). It was seared and caramelized on the outside and *barely* raw in the center--just a wisp. Perfect.  The sides were huge. Each side feeds two people, possibly three. We shared a full bottle of sauvignon blanc, drank tap and sparkling water, and finished with French press coffee. Our anniversary was earlier in the week, and the waiter brought us a gratis chocolate mousse desert with a \"Happy Anniversary\" message to share.  The bill came with two caramel/chocolate candies that seemed homemade. It was phenomenal caramel! Our entire bill was $130. We expected to pay more. We cannot recommend this restaurant enough! The value is there. The food, most importantly, is fantastic. And really...isn't that what dining is all about if you are going to go out with people you love to share it?  GREAT PLACE!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Orange Sky a few times and the food and service have always been great...and you just can't beat that view anywhere else in town."}
{"text":"My wife surprised me for father's day with a trip to Talking Stick and a dinner at this stunning restaurant. This place celebrates the desert and all things Arizona- the view is incredible in every direction, and the ambiance of the interior is just as stunning. When we arrived there was a lounge singer near the waiting area with a drummer and pianist accompanying her- we were taken back to our table and the menu was explained in great detail by our friendly server, Lisa. Once we ordered, we were encouraged to spend our wait for the food sipping our drinks on the 15th story patio that overlooks the golf course. I killed my smartphones batteries taking pictures of the wild horses wandering the outskirts of the property.  My wife ordered the pork chop- I had the Australian lamb. They were both very good- as were the sides, drinks and dessert (smore creme brulee). All in all, we spent two hours there and never felt rushed. The bill was expectedly high ($170 after tip- roughly the amount we paid for the room that night), but for me, eating here is a one-time thing anyway, so the expense isn't one I have to plan for in the future. Not really a place I'd drag my toddlers.  I highly recommend Orange Sky if time and money are no object."}
{"text":"The evening was turned off when you have to ask three times for a window table.  At the reservation and twice when they want to seat you at an interior table.  They say that window seats are not held and basically first come first seated.  But twenty feet from our interior table was an open window seat.  When you are spending $200 on dinner maybe you shouldn't start off the night fighting for a seat that is available.  Not interested in going back."}
{"text":"The views and intimacy of this place are top notch. The prices were a little on the high side. The steak was very mediocre but seafood and scallops I thought were very good. However, we ate there on Saturday night with a party of 12, and a few of our party came late. Our waiter seemed annoyed and dismissive. Very hard to get a drink and the lack of friendliness rubbed us the wrong way. Automatic 22% gratuity, and for that I would've expected A LOT better service. Our meal alone was $160 and there were four other couples with us... Who ordered a lot more food and drinks. A hefty bill and tip I'm sure.  With so many excellent choices in the Scottsdale area, next time we will have dinner elsewhere and come to the casino after."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW.  I had an incredible 12 oz tenderloin.  It was extremely thick but they managed to cook it perfectly.  Lightly crusted shell and medium rare was  not overdone in the slightest.  Practically melted in my mouth.  Pretty reasonable prices... 35-45 bucks for such an incredible steak is great."}
{"text":"Always excellent  the Wait  staff is very  caring and extremely  efficient  along with the food I would recommend this restaurant  all over the place"}
{"text":"Made a reservation online for my wife's birthday four days before. It was on Saturday 10-14-17 for 5:15pm. I have an email confirmation!! When I called to confirm that day the girl told me my reservation was cancelled!!! I have been to this restaurant many times. The help needs help big time! We then went to Ocean Club for a fine meal!!"}
{"text":"We celebrated my birthday at Orange Sky recently.  Our waiter, Will, was exceptionally good and went the extra mile for us.  He made us feel right at home, and graciously took a few pictures for us to remember the night.  It was our first time at the restaurant so we didn't know exactly what to expect.  The setting is lovely; high ceilings with very large windows; the music soothing.    I had foie gras which I thoroughly enjoyed and then for the main course, 4 large diver scallops.  i was hesitant about the chili miso sauce since i don't like spicy dishes but it wasn't spicy at all and in fact a delicious accompaniment to the scallops.  Will had it put it a nice sized sauce boat for me and I think I used it all up!  My dear husband had the salmon which he always loves.  After dinner Will brought out a complimentary dessert complete with candle.   Next time I would love to sit out on the patio and enjoy the great outdoors from there."}
{"text":"Very nice dining experience.  The food was good and certainly white table cloth fare.  Reservations were full during the sunset hour, so call early to reserve your table.  We ate after 8:00pm and would have enjoyed it more at an earlier time.  Mostly, everyone was nice from the hostesses to the waiter who took our order.  The only wait-person not up to parr was the man who plopped our food orders down on the table and clanged the silverware on the plates doing so.  He wasn't the man who took our order, just the guy delivering the food.  He probably needs some coaching in that respect, as well as how to say \"enjoy your food\" in a more pleasant voice. Maybe he was just having a bad night. All in all, we enjoyed the meal and the complementary \"birthday dessert\" and would go back to catch the sunset."}
{"text":"Great food and service and the best views anywhere. Rob-eye excellent and  halibut is perfect"}
{"text":"We dined at Orange Sky last Saturday and the place was packed! The casino was full and so was the restaurant.  We had a party of 11 and were not so lucky to get a super long table from tip to tail. Use the potty before you sit down in the large comfy chairs because backing them up for a break can be interesting.  The service seemed great at first and then went progressively downhill. The servers should probably learn how to do magic tricks and make balloon animals to entertain the customers while they are waiting and waiting and waiting.  The restaurant was out of lobster for a 7PM seating and after 3 people ordered oysters they came back to say they were out of those as well.  The crab Louie salad had an odd flavor to the dressing and 3 unexplainable crustini's that you couldn't cut or pick up.  Tough and slow seemed to be the buzz words at the table. I had the pork chop and it was so dry I felt like I could blow dust out of my mouth while trying to muster up enough saliva to swallow it.  Everyone that ordered steak said they were tough and overdone. The beef comes from Arkansas.  The asparagus was the size of my big toe and was recommended over the brocolini.  They graced our birthday boy and girl with a fabulous chocolate mousse desert which was very good. As we all stared and shared they came back 10 minutes later to see if anyone else wanted desert, but the chocolate mousse was not an option.  When the one dreaded desert order was taken I ordered a hot tea which had at least a half of a cup of tea leaves in a two cup pitcher. Can you say, \"tea buzzzz\"?  Maybe they need to read some of these reviews as these seem to be common complaints.  The venue is very very nice and I think you know what I think about the rest."}
{"text":"The food was fine.  Staff was nice and the ambience is very nice.  Great views.  The food itself is overpriced for the quality.  My wife and I got two entrees and two sides.  There was nothing bad, but we've had much better versions of everything we got - salmon, ribeye steak, asparagus, potatoes.  Without alcohol, it was $140.  A little pricey in my opinion."}
{"text":"It was supposed to be a special night with my girlfriend.  A Monday Night at a fancy restaurant with a great view at a casino with some fun, how could this not be a great night.  At least that's what I thought.  The second we got to the restaurant it seemed like we were bothering the people who were supposed to sit us at our table.  The huge dining room was half empty with no ambience and our waitress was not exactly \"warm and fuzzy\".  We ordered drinks and dinner at the same time and they both came to the table at about the same time meaning the food was not exactly made to order.  The food tasted okay at best.  We were at dinner for less than an hour with a bad waitress, okay food, and a drink each which all cost about $120.  Money we don't mind spending if it's worth it.  We gave the waitress the smallest tip I have ever given anyone.  I'm not sure she noticed or even cared.  Both of us were so upset that we went straight home.  My girlfriend looked stunning and thats the only good thing I will remember from my trip to Orange Sky."}
{"text":"Amazing food, Amazing service, Amazing atmosphere   If your going as a couple ask for the couch seats  Oysters are fantastic! And Crab is to die for!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a nice restaurant with a view for our anniversary this weekend. I had a 7:30 reservation last night, in which I showed up 10 minutes early for. We were told there was no table yet, but would grab us when it was ready.  About 7:40 came around and we had not been set yet. The hostess comes over and has to continually ask us our party name and what we are waiting on. I told her 3 times our name and our reservation time. We finally are sat down and are promptly poured glasses of water. Then we sit for over 15 minutes before we are approached by a waitress who was not ours to ask if we had been helped yet. We had not even ordered a drink yet... At this point I was thoroughly dissapointed and we have yet to even order our food. When the waitress came to finally take our order, we order our drinks then them she has to take our IDs to the computer to scan them for 5 minutes to make sure we are of age...she tells us it's easier then doing the math. We then go to order, she asked us if we were ready and then tells us \"even though you are ready I will help you with the menu\" as if we were 10 years old and have never been out to eat at a restaurant. She then goes to question my wife about how her steak is being cooked....is this really a fine dining? I've been all over the US and world eating at highly rated restaurants and this was one of the worst experiences I have had. I would have had better service at IHOP. Thankfully the food was spot on! And my steak was cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"Upon our arrival there was lots of confusement regarding our reservation & seating. Once we were, it was a lovely table where we were to celebrate a mildstone Birthday. After 10 minutes a group of a least 30-40 men were standing across from being very loud where we could not hear ourselves speak. We did speak to a waitier & they were then seated across from us in the bar area. It became apparent that this was going to continue all night & right before our dinner was to be served we had to speak to a manger to be moved to a quiet table. We felt as though we were at a spots bart instead of a special occasion rest.   The service was not great & he was pushing drinks more then anything. The rolls were terrible.  He recomended a white wine & to my surprise when the bill came it was $17.00  which was ridiculous. To top it off the waiter at the end of the evening brings out a desert with a candle & lights it when 2 of our guests were not at the table & he wanted to blow out the candle & leave it with his lighter.  What an insulting evening & had to pay big dollars for an evening that deserves 2 stars for the view.  We shall not be back."}
{"text":"I LOVED this place! My boyfriend took me here to propose and it was everything i could ask for. The waitress was very pleasant and seemed to genuinely care about how we liked the food. The chef even made a special dessert as a congratulations. I cant wait to go back"}
{"text":"Only the atmosphere kept me from giving this a one star.  We got there and weren't seated until 8:15 for our 8:00 res.  At first 3 different people came to our table and took our wine water and food orders.  Then when I got my soup they didn't bring me a spoon.  So I sat there for almost 20 minutes staring at my bisque before the waiter came to ask me how it was.  It was cold by the time I finally got a spoon.  Then, it was 30 min later we were ready to walk out because they had not dropped of our entre yet and nobody had checked in with us.  Finally the steaks came and they were barely average.  Not worth the money.  This place is on the 15th floor and the view from our private booth was great but everything else was pretty bad.  Not recommended.  Such a shame because the setting is very nice."}
{"text":"When we get out, Orange Sky is one of our top favorites.  It is a favorite for many reasons, number one being the quality of the food.  The tenderloin and salmon are big favorites and you can't go wrong with any of the sides.  Additionally, we enjoy the atmosphere.  The restaurant is lovely and the views are great.  There are many options spanning private dining areas, main dining areas, patios, etc.  The patios do have heaters as well.  The place to go for great sunset views!    We like Orange Sky so much we selected it for our company holiday party.  It was outstanding.  Again, the food was great - even for large parties.  We worked with Cameo Wall and she was fantastic.  She was on top of everything and a real pleasure to work with.  The entire staff was great and very attentive.  I would highly recommend Orange Sky for both individual dining as well as corporate events."}
{"text":"We had a great experience here for my birthday dinner this evening.  My brother recommended this venue after he and his wife had dinner on the patio, and we were actually fortunate enough to have the same waiter (Will), who put it over the top for us.  Whether you're from the Valley, or are visiting, we highly recommend the views and the food at Orange Sky."}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to a great dinner before the show at Talking Stick (Kathleen Madigan) but was sorely disappointed. Fine dining? The Sky is the Limit? NOT! The restaurant was SO cold! While my husband and I were waiting for our meal, we were prepared to leave because we  were both shivering! The silverware was ice cold! Manager said he turned down the A/C and it did begin to warm up. But then our entrees arrived........bones in the bass \"fillet\", overcooked salmon, cold corn side dish....very unpleasant. Do I ever pass up dessert? Did this night!! Was anxious to pay the bill and get out of there."}
{"text":"Service was excellent, view is breathtaking, food a little disappointing. Scallops overdone and salty...maybe a one - time mishap.Looking forward to our desserts! Got trapped by the extraordinarily long tablecloth and tired of listening to \"I'm too Sexy\" and \"Der Kommisar\" Fun!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love Orange sky! The food is always amazing. We always sit in one of the private booth which are very romantic and private."}
{"text":"Even the most pickiest eatera will be pleasently surprised."}
{"text":"Our thoughts about Orange Sky mirrors many of the other comments here.  The bad offsets the good.  We arrived for a reservation timed to watch the sun set.  As others have noted we had to walk through a smoke-filled Casino to get to the private elevator up to the restaurant.  I'm not sure if there is another way in, but we asked several outside staff where we should park for the restaurant and followed their directions.   Once inside the casino from the west parking area, we followed the signs on the ceiling signs to get us into the general area, although not all signs along our path indicated the way.  We had to look around until we found other signs that brought us to the private elevators.  There's a young lady there who we assume is the doorman preventing the general population from getting up to the restaurant as looky-loos, which we appreciated.  What we didn't really like was the dress code.  Not that there was a dress code, but why bother if it only excludes the most basic t-shirts, flip-flops, and baggy pants.  We were dressed up for our special occasion, but most of the other patrons to this high-end restaurant were dressed like they were going out to shop at Walmart.  Not really the experience we were expecting.  We would have liked the code to rather tell you the minimum standards of dress.  The ambiance at the restaurant is simply spectacular, less of course the view of the parking lot.  We didn't find it as distracting as some others, but the point is noted.  That being said, the sunset was amazing and when it got dark the lights on the 101, the Pavilion, and the houses on Camelback were just beautiful.  The open floor plan is very appealing also.  Many people talked about their private booths on the way into the main seating area, but we like to see all the action.  The service was OK, but we've had much better at places like Remington's and Casa Mia.  While the staff pays attention, the interaction is just not at the level of professionalism you'd expect at a high-end place.  The exception was the Sommelier, Lukas, who knows his stuff and added a lot of class to the experience.  Another issue we found was the waiter stations located in-between every other table against the windows.  We were uncomfortable having conversations with the staff standing right behind our chair and their constant movement around us distracted from our experience.  Why in the world are there wait stations on the floor in-between tables?    Food presentation was mixed.  We started with the Antipasti plate.  It was a work of art, laid out wonderfully with flatbread accents on a wooden platter.  What ruined the whole thing was the metal sauce cup, which held the delicious fig compote. These are the same ones you get at a diner to hold Ketchup.   Why they wouldn't put it in a white ceramic bowl I don't know, but that little change would really step it up instead of having the cheap metal cup drag it down.  Attention to detail if you're a 4 star restaurant.  Our steaks came on a giant white plate with the steak and a small pepper as a garnish.  Food presentation can't be stressed enough.   We stared at our plates and found it to be of limited appeal.  While the steaks were outstanding, they didn't look very appealing all alone on the big white canvass.  Yes, the sides are served in separate bowls and you need the room on the plate to put them, but that doesn't excuse being served a slab of meat on a giant white plate.  Pretty plain.  The steaks come with a side of sauce.  Again, the sauce came in a cheap SMALL metal cup that was placed on the table instead of a white ceramic bowl matching the plates, and placed ON the plate.  That would have helped with presentation.  The blue cheese butter was piped in the cup instead of the typical \"coins\" made by rolling the butter and cheese into a log, then cutting it into coins.  The coins are easier to place on your steak and melt much better.  The coins would have actually provided enough for the steak.   The amount that came in the cup with the steak wasn't even worth serving with a $38 steak, and an extra cup was $4.  I would rather have given the small amount back and had them knock $4 off the steak.  Wine.  This is always a touchy area and there are several schools of though.  First, Lukas's wine list is spectacular.   It has a wide range of offerings at a wide range of prices, and he has probably the best selection of Cakebread in the state.  That being said, I found the prices all over the place.  Some were priced at 100% markup, some at 200% and some even higher.   I don't mind paying 100% as this is probably the maximum \"fair\" price in my view.  That's my school of thought.  Other's, including Orange Sky, may think they can charge more because of the view out the windows. That's their prerogative, and maybe they have the clientele that doesn't mind paying these markups.   Maestro's does this and that's their niche, but Maestros is head and shoulders above Orange Sky in"}
{"text":"My husband took me here for our anniversary. What a great view, staff, and meal. Loved my lamb chops and he loved his steak. Perfect date spot."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, our server, Amy did her Chef proud!"}
{"text":"This was a tremendous disappointment as the steak($40 ribeye) was tough and clearly not a prime cut. The foie gras was undercooked and dripping blood. The only thing that saved our 36th Anniversary dinner was the great service. I had eaten at Orange Sky before and recommended it to friends. I will no longer recommend it to anyone.  Dave Wilson"}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere..wonderful service...its an experience..  we had to wait 30 minutes later than our reservation and the dinner took 2 hours..but the dinner was delicious and its a beautiful place. We walked out to the balcony and it's quite a view.  Our server was very polite and sweet. I liked the big table and the service. Our fondue and bread was delicious. I enjoyed the overall experience."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of eating at Orange Sky lastnight saturday evening. We had reservations at 5:30 to celebrate a friends birthday.  As previous reviews stated, there is a dress code, and a private elevator up to the restaurant. We were seated immediately and greeted by 3 servers.   Our main server was very knowledgeable about the menu and answered any of our questions. Restaurant week had just begun that day and she explained that menu.There was some confusion when it came to the restaurant week menu.  I did not opt to do restaurant week however, one of their dishes was on the main menu and priced seperately so I was under the impression I could order that dish seperate. When my dinner came, it had no sauce as the menu stated it would, and it lacked the extra flair. The waitress, Lisa, was quick to bring it back to the kitchen and have them fix it. She stated it is confusing and they were expecting it as it was the first night of restaurant week. I enjoyed the dinner from there on out.   Also, our water glasses were often and that is a plus to me!  One complaint I had, was regarding my wine order. I had left the table for some time while the others at my table had ordered a glass of wine. When I came back, the servers had failed to ask me if I wanted another glass of wine. I had to then ask for the wine menu and take it from there.   Overall, a great experience, and would go back for a special occasion!"}
{"text":"So it was my husband's birthday and he wanted a restaurant with ambiance.  OK - We had heard good things about Orange Sky so I made a reservation 2 weeks in advance.  2 weeks is not enough time if you want a premium seat.  The view is beautiful (if you can see it - we could not from our table) and you must spend at least $ 200 to even reserve a premium table.   Then we get there and immediately told to go to the bar and have a drink.  What is the point in making a reservation if I have to wait.  (In my opinion it is just a ploy to get you to spend $ on $ 15 drinks... I'm just sayin) .  While we were waiting for the table another couple came in and was immediately seated.  That really pissed me off.  I finally made my husband go up to the hostess and complain.  About 3 minutes later the manager came over and took us to our table.   When we frequent these types of restaurants we expect a certain level of service.  Our waiter was nice but not very attentive.  It is the little things - I asked for ice tea no lemon and sugar - sure enough my tea had lemon in it.  Then he handed me the sugar packet dish.  I told him 3 times I don't need sugar but he never took the dish away.  I asked for bread and that didn't come until our meal was served.  Then he brought us the check and he never came back for payment.  Another waitress came over and took it for us.  He showed up as we were walking out the door.    The food was o.k.  Of course the waiter recommended the most expensive item on the menu and my husband ordered it.  (Did I hear the word - UPSELL?)  He had the rib eye with crab and I had the scallops.  They were o.k.  But was it worth $ 200?  I don't think so."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing experience. Michael our server was well rounded and passionate on the entire menu with suggestions and all around favorites. My fiance and i really never go to upscale places but we are very glad we decided on this one. Im one that is not used to such catering when out to dinner so it was out of my element but a fantastic environment. Only one draw back would be the hostess. Im in retail and know the importance of a first and last impression, which is a huge part of a customers experience and patron retention. She was leaning on the hostess stand upon arrival. Im not possitive on what she was doing on her phone but it took a good time for her to acknowledge us. Not very pleasant or excited on arrival or as we left."}
{"text":"We read reviews but decided to give it a try and write our own review. The view,service and atmosphere was good. The food was good, nothing great or outstanding for the price.  Please note that prices start at $28.00 and up.  To give you some reference if you have been to Ocean Club, those are the prices you are paying without the great food,service etc. Best thing to do is go for a drink I'd you want to see the view. Actually if you want to go for the view, do something better like hiking camel back for free and you get excellent exercise out of it."}
{"text":"Our server was amazing, however, my husband had the elk and it came out cold and raw so we sent it back and it was still pretty pink when he got it back. After eating the elk, he wound up with food poisoning."}
{"text":"Requested a seat by the window so we could watch the sunset a month in advance. Seating fist offered when we showed up for a 5:15pm reservation couldn't even see the window or the sun. None of the window tables were occupied and the reservation specified this was a special dinner for my wife. I had to press the hostess to read the reservation and provide the correct seating, which was a table that could just \"see\" the window. Don't expect much."}
{"text":"We had reserved the \"private\" booths for 4 people that face the west in order to watch the beautiful sunset  followed by the lights of Scottsdale and Phoenix awakening. The food is wonderful as is the service plus the drinks were great. A minor dislike is that the wine seems to be overpriced. We'll go back 2 or 3 times a year."}
{"text":"Was very excited to try Orange Sky. Unfortunately, not up to par food wise. Had a 12oz beef tenderloin and Parmesan smashed baby potatoes. Should have cooked at home. Won't go back. Extremely disappointed. The tenderloin was nothing special. The cut cooked medium  rare was dry. The potatoes, needed a little something. Maybe, a little black truffle oil. Will take clients to see the view. I would just go for dessert."}
{"text":"If you like yummy food, breath taking views, and if you wish a little gambling...this is the place! Hotel itself not open yet, but the restaurant and casino are. Huge fan of Orange Sky!"}
{"text":"This place is a joke. We sat for 25 minutes with no service.  Even asked twice for a waiter or waitress. No wonder it wasn't busy.  We ended up walking out.  And the views aren't great either."}
{"text":"Great place for a romantic dinner once you get away from the smoke filled casino floor.  Steaks were a great size and you can't beat the views if you can get table windows. Even the golf course view is nice. Call way ahead to get a good table or on a weekend or special night."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our dining experience last night with the sunset & beautful views. We usually come here for special occasions.  The Alaskan king crab legs are a specialty and also the lamb special. The waiter was very professional very nice. We will be back again. I recommend this restaurant for a fine dining experience."}
{"text":"The restaurant view is a must see, the 360 degree during sunset is the best time.. amazing food that is actually reasonably prices compared to a 4 star restaurant in SF.  Look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Stayed at Talking Stick. Made reservations at Orange Sky, expecting wonderful views. $200 minimum to be seated next to the windows. At the very least they should inform you when making the reservation. Dress code is supposed to be Business Casual but that is a joke. Good food and service but will not be going back."}
{"text":"This restaurant was AMAZING. Everyone is so kind. I went there to celebrate an anniversary and when calling to make a reservation they ask if its a special occasion. At the end of our incredibly delicious dinner (The Elk is phenomenal) They brought out this fudge and a very sweet, decorated plate that read happy anniversary! It was such a nice touch. The service was spectacular! Julio helped us and he could not have been more attentive, polite and kind!! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I went last night there and the place is amazing.  The food, the service and the employees are great.  I had the rib eye steak and it was delicious.  The dessert was a work of art."}
{"text":"Knowledgeable waitstaff and gluten free food prep made this a fine dining experience. If you care about the origin and quality of what you consume this may become your favorite restaurant!  Our group tried salmon, scallops, sea bass and center cut filet. We sampled each other's meal but liked our own and were all unwilling to share more than a bite. We liked the cauliflower gratin and kale (with a cayenne kick) sides too.  For dessert we again shared a panna cotta and a chocolate treat; both were delicious.   And then we enjoyed the orange, pink, red, blue, purple light play over Camelback and sunset beyond Mummy Mountain in Paradise Valley..."}
{"text":"Party of six on a Thursday night. The food, the service, the view all outstanding. Could anything been improved....probably not. Each one choose something different, and all was prepared perfectly. The service by Kyle and his assistant was friendly and professional....wish all restaurants were this good. I do not mind paying this price for something this good."}
{"text":"I always feel like a great meal should be great from the beginning to its end. And this review would have been 5 stars up until the end.  Live was our waitress and she was excellent. She recommended some great suggestions and was very attentive. So attentive that a table of four cost us $500. We ended the meal for the four of us with great desserts and coffee. Once we were done my friend said have you ever seen the outside patio. I said no and he said well check it out. We got out of our private booth and were heading done to the patio when all of a sudden an obnoxious staff member named Octovia stopped us and said where are you going? And then said normally we don't allow people to go down this area and you have to be quiet and I will make this exception. When you send $500 on a meal and want to walk to a public patio on the same floor, that is not how to approach a patron, especially when they just had a great evening. And to make his even better of a story, I asked for the managers name and got Nicks card. But wanted to make sure I got the correct persons name. So when we took the elevator done to the main floor, Octovia was there. And I told her how rude she was. She didn't care and then I said I will be sure to let Nick know. And she just walked away and said do that. Octavia might need to get some customer service skills because I will let Nick know."}
{"text":"I took my wife to Orange Sky for our anniversary.  It was a great dinner, and our service was excellent.  We arrived at the time of our reservation and were taken immediately to our table.  Our server, Amy, was very attentive. She offered suggestions on the menu and explained some of the items she thought needed more description than the menu offered. We tried the fried calamari appetizer.  For our entrees my wife ordered scallops and I ordered a steak, which we both shared.  All the items we ordered were perfect.  The only thing that prevented this from being a five star review was the fact that a place like this had no draft beers - only bottled."}
{"text":"Went here on mine and my wife's anniversary. we were greeted promptly, they knew my name, and knew why we were there. We got a private booth, and a free dessert for our anniversary. Very nice, ambiance was great, service was good, food was good. The view was the best. Will definitely recommend to others and will return"}
{"text":"If you want excellence in food quality and taste, atmosphere, service and to be treated like royalty, Orange Sky is where you should dine! In the multiple times we have been there, we have never been disappointed.  Each visit is better than the previous one.  The sunsets are spectacular regardless of where in the room you are seated.  A bit pricey; but totally worth the dining experience."}
{"text":"Although rather expensive, the food was great: I recommend the kobe beef and the truffle baked potato. The booths were very intimate and very cozy, great for a night out. However, the location is rather isolated."}
{"text":"What an absolutely fabulous way to spend my birthday! This restaurant exudes luxury and class! From the impeccable interior decor to the elegance of  the perfectly positioned indoor/outdoor fireplace! The views of the skyline are breathtaking and add instant romance to any dinner. However this is not just any dinner. The waitstaff makes you feel so cared for  and looked after that you feel weightless from the stress of the day! I was waited on by very charismatic lady with the loveliest British accent! She had such a great rapport with the people at the tables as well as mine. Effortlessly making sure you had everything you needed as well as throwing in a bit of British humor, which I found utterly charming and entertaining! Oh and the tenderloin..........just melted in my mouth as well as the chocolate surprise dessert they brought me without my asking to celebrate my birthday! How thoughtful! This is definitely the spot to impress, visitors or clients from out of town. But for me it could become an every weekend dinner. There is not enough great things I can say except for, Keep up the great work, Talking Stick Resort! And Orange Sky you definitely belong among the many wonderful restaurants in this amazing 5 star resort! See you again soon!"}
{"text":"Our family had a great time there to celebrate our son's 18th birthday. I am sure my son will have a everlasting memory. So will we. We thank Orange Sky and the waitress. The birthday cake was a big surprise for my son too. When my younger son turns 18, we will come back. We hope our sons' future will be just like the view you can see from the 15th floor: what a beautiful orange and bright sky!"}
{"text":"Orange Sky really has an incredible atmosphere. The view is 5+ stars. The food is more like 3.5-4 stars. We went here and made a reservation for a private booth to watch the sunset. It is so cool to do this. The view from the room is amazing and they open the curtains for you to watch the sunset in private. You can walk outside while you are waiting for your food to a really nice patio type area where you can bring your drinks and relax.   The food was really good overall, but  not what you'd expect from a restaurant so amazing in every other way. We ordered the filet, scallops, crab, oysters, and cheese plate. The filet and scallops were cooked perfectly, but both had a little too much seasoning for our taste. The crab was seasoned much better, but slightly overcooked. The oysters and cheese plate were both nice, but nothing exceptional. The desert was fantastic.   I would recommend Orange Sky to anyone looking for a special occasion place. The view really sets this place apart from any other restaurant in the area that I can think of."}
{"text":"Excellent choice for romantic dinner. Our server, Faye, was extremely attentive but not overbearing. The appetizers were great, as were the mains and sides. (Elk and king crab). If you've never had elk, you should try it at least once.   After dinner, walk out on to the patio. Take a look in all directions, and be amazed by the wonders of the desert."}
{"text":"Ambiance was amazing, service was great and food was good. I'm not convinced the food is worth the prices they charge but what the food lacks is definitely made up for by the beautiful surroundings. Having said that, I would certainly go back to enjoy drinks and apps in the lounge and relish in the atmosphere and listen to the live music. Would probably skip out on dinner though unless someone else was footing the bill. They have live music seven nights a week in the lounge but the guy who performs on Tuesdays really blew me away. Acoustic guitar combined with a superb voice. His version of Piano Man on the guitar was exceptional.   As others mentioned, you have to walk through the smoke filled, noisy \"ching ching ching ching\"  casino to get to the Orange Sky elevators but once you're up there you forget about all the casino happenings below you. And, the resort should really do a better job marketing this great spot. It doesn't even mention on their site that they have live music and to me that was the highlight. One more thing, I would probably wait a few (or more) months before going as they are still in construction clean-up mode surrounding the resort. Once the desert is free of construction debris and returned to it's natural desert habitat the views will be even better."}
{"text":"15th floor = views of all Scottsdale, fountain hills - and then some!   Cutting edge.  Super sleek & elite.   Sexy glass balconies for extra view-points.   Whooshed up in private elevators that provide a glimpse of things to come in glass-enclosed ride, but only briefly since it's only seconds to reach the top.  I can't wait until they start with specials such as wine tastings, beginning July."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited Orange Sky for our 8th wedding anniversary. The space is nice and clean, and the views were very good. Our server was fantastic and all the staff was very attentive to us throughout the evening.  The chairs were a little beat up looking but I could never decide if that was intentional or not. I will also know better and ask for a private booth. The food was underwhelming at best. We started with the Artisanal Cheeses which was pleasant and what I would consider standard fare. My wife ordered the salmon with the crab on the side, and I chose the Wagyu striploin. For our sides we had the asparagus, and the Crushed potatoes which were both very good. My wife's salmon was cooked well and was very pretty. From a taste stand point it was Ok but nothing to write home about. The crab was well cooked and tasted great. The steak was such a disappointment. When you see Wagyu you expect a certain quality and experience. The steak was cooked very unevenly, there was a fairly significant chunk of fat or gristle that I was forced to spit out, and the flavor just didn't live up to the hype. Maybe I built the steak up too much in my mind which led to my disappointment but it was definitely not what I was expecting.  In closing, good views, good environment, great service, ok food. The experience fell short for us."}
{"text":"Wow, this is a hard one. I have been here several times for work functions and this last time for a nice Date Night with my husband. Hands down one of the most AMAZING views in town. They have these really cool high top private booths that face the sunset, and since my hubby is always planning the date nights, thought I would plan one for him.  First, I tried for 2 weeks to get a reservation at sunset. It was either 5pm with the seniors, 8pm or 9:45.  8pm it is which barely makes the sunset. Well, we were seated 20 minutes LATE (even though we were there 30 min early), but at least got to see the beautiful view of Camelback Mountain and watch the sunset from the balcony. Balcony is small and no handles on the doors so you get locked out once you shut the doors, so you have to knock to have someone let you back in!  Finally seated in our beautiful private booth. (BTW, it is $125 minimum on the weekend) We order some wine. We have to ask for bread, not automatically just brought. Bread was not that great, but before wine, I make sure to eat it! We ordered a dozen oysters, which we love. They only had 1 kind, and they were just OKAY....plus they only brought 1 TINY TINY lemon for the oysters for 12 oysters!! What?!?!  I despise horseradish and hubby loves it, was not very happy that they serve the cocktail sauce and horseradish together in the same bowl, so i have not choice by the end to eat some or ask for my own.  We ordered a bottle of Red Zinfandel. I strongly feel any restaurant that is $75-$90pp should automatically decant the wine, which they did not. At least the red wine was slightly chilled. (YES, i have become a wine snob after having lots of great wines, there is a HUGE difference when it is slightly chilled and decanted)  Dinner, I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass ($32) and hubby had the New York Strip ($I think $30 something) along with a side that was a mix of quinoa, corn, green beans and much to my distaste-goat cheese. I HATE goat cheese and can always tell when it is in something. I asked the waiter if I had missed it in the description on the menu and he said no, for some reason they don't list it there and he has had quite a few complaints about it.  Sea Bass-needed salt badly. No salt and pepper were on the table, so I had to ask for it. I was pleasantly surprised the server came back w/ 3 kinds of sea salt-regular, bamboo and an alderwood type. The bamboo was my favorite and found my fish tasty after seasoning it.  Steak:Hubby said it was cooked fine but wasn't wowed by it.   Server was nice, but not what I would call fine dining material. He greeted us promptly and started to tell us the specials and then said he was getting old and forgot what they were.   Another odd thing, this restaurant is pretty large, and the bathroom in the restaurant is a 1 person bathroom. Very strange! There is another one in the lounge down the hall that is bigger.  Fun factor though there is great. in the lounge we ran into 3 different groups of people that we knew and had a great time. Then we went downstairs and just played some slots since Craps is my only real love and I don't do the video craps they have, I like the real deal.  SO, overall, great to experience it, sunset and view is AMAZING, place is hopping with all kinds of people, dining experience is subpar. I hands down would spend the money and Mastro's City Hall and just go to Orange Sky to meet up with friends for drinks when we can break away from the kiddos."}
{"text":"What an outstanding dining experience!!!  While the food is more like a 4 - between the food, service, and atmosphere, I have to give it a 5.  We went here to celebrate my hubby's birthday.  Price-wise, it did cost what we would have spent on a little over our usual 3 Sat. nights out.  We did reserve a private booth and I am glad we did as it just adds to the whole experience. Sunset has moved a little more westward by the time they open so we didn't get an outstanding view of that but the overall view, especially  in the dark, was splendid.  Our waitress was extremely knowledgeable when it came to the details of the menu.  My husband likes all that \"heat\" seen on the menu but I cannot tolerate even a little as it totally destroys the food itself for me - all I taste is heat and what is mild to some, just kills my taste buds. You can Wasabi and horseradish me to death, just don't set my tongue on fire. So the waitress really helped me pick what could be easily adjusted to my liking of seasoning for which I will be forever grateful.  We split a shrimp cocktail which consisted of 6 very large shrimp. I make it myself a lot at home and two of the six were ever so slightly on the soggy side.  However, the cocktail sauce had shaved horseradish on top and made me forget about any flaw with the shrimp. My husband had the tomato bisque which I am sorry I didn't also.  That was outstanding.  I had ordered the Campari Tomatoes, white balsamic and sea salt. I am a tomato freak (NJ girl) but I would not order this again as it was not worth the price. Again, this is something I do myself at home.  Maybe regular balsamic would have been better or regular salt. Salt  was not on the table as I am sure the chef takes pride in the proper amount of seasoning and it is not the fault of Orange Sky as in many restaurants we frequent, I do not add salt except to raw tomatoes so maybe it is just me.  For dinner, hubby had the rib-eye with yellow tomato horseradish sauce and I had the flat iron steak with the garlic butter sauce. There is plenty of sauce to mix and match so we did.  I was worried the flat iron would be chewy but it was perfect. We added a side of the poached king crab for a surf and turf.   We shared smashed potatoes with pancetta, artichokes, and Parmesan.  Unfortunately, while the pancetta added to the flavor during cooking I am sure, the pieces were like hard little bits and would have been better if not included in the finished product.    Since there was a little mix-up on the soup order and we had to wait longer, they comped us (we didn't ask, they just did it.). They also gave my husband a complimentary dessert which was a chocolate mousse type of square over a crunchy layer of what we would find out later were rice crispies. In a million years, you would not guess rice crispies.  Drinks were pricey and we did order wine but like my husband said as the dinner was over \"we are worth it\".  I would definitely go back for another special occasion!!!  This is true dining folks."}
{"text":"We had our Valentines dinner at Orange Sky and it was unbelievable! We were given a private booth, facing the Scottsdale Valley, and it was absolutely beautiful.  Our server, Carissa, was so professional and well-versed on the menu and she made the experience so, very special.  We were blown away by the hospitality of everyone we passed- from the hostesses to the sommelier, the additional servers to the manager- each person stopped and took the time to make sure we were enjoying our evening and being taken care of.  The food was absolutely extraordinary!  The sea bass is a Must Try and the beef tenderloin was heaven.  I just can't say enough.  Well done, team... it couldn't have been any better.  I am \"Wowed\"!"}
{"text":"Dined at Orange Sky three times so far and they have always exceeded our expectations.  The Scallop dish is great and I don't even like scallops.  The salmon is my favorite, perfectly prepared.  The wait staff is the best around!  Did I mention the great Views, oh I'll be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I took another couple for their birthday. It was one of the worse experiences we have ever had at a so called fine dining 5 star restaurant! From the i greeting into the restaurant to to presentation of the bill! When we walked there were 4 girls at the station. Not one looked up and acknowledged our presence! We arrived early but at the time of our reservation we were told, outer table would be ready in 15 minutes. Instead of apologizing she intimated it was our problem! When we were finally seated, the hostess had us hold our drinks, at which our guest spilled most of her drink by the time we arrived at our table! 5 star- no one has a tray to carry the drinks on? The wait person was nice however timing of service was most inconsistant! When I tried to get his attention he motioned with his hand 1 minute! 5 star?  Ordered a 2nd cup of hot tea, brought me a bag with  hot water, no new cup! I had to ask someone running around for a new cup! All in all, we have been to many fine dining restaurants, to us, this was far from fine dining!  Never would go back!"}
{"text":"One of the top ten restaurants I've had the pleasure of dining! The service was outstanding. It was a very busy night and the atmosphere was electric, the best you can find in AZ!  I went on Restaurant Week. Yes... it is amateur week but, I could not have been more impressed.  The GM gave us a tour of the restaurant which apparently they do not offer normally on the weekends. After walking past the live music every night there are 2 private dining rooms and 7 private dining booths. The private booths are incredible. You have your own personal window that looks over the 101 and has mountain views from 15 stories up in the sky (hence the name!). The entire restaurant is so spacious. Truly non-existent anymore. We were lucky enough to go out on the patio and spot panoramic views of the golf course and you can even see wild horses running through the dessert!!  The sommelier was Luciano. He was wonderful and didn't make us feel we should order a $100+ bottle of wine. The wine list was extensive but, we settled on Wild Horse pinot noir (it was only appropriate). Kim, our server was experience, knowledgeable and friendly. Then came the food!! My steaks were cooked perfectly and my wife is still raving about the yellow fin tuna. Dessert....Oh my God......  Negatives: Have to walk through the smoky gamblers and poor signage. Positives: The friendly staff and unparalleled atmosphere.  We really had a wonderful evening and we were thrilled to find the best kept secrete in AZ!!"}
{"text":"This place has wonderful food But when the server is so bad you have to ask management for a different one is sad How ever the replacement was great But at 100 per plate you expect more a lot more But the food was wonderful I had the bison steak was cooked perfect and sides were flavorful and seasoned perfect And the views are breathtaking"}
{"text":"The view was great and the service was too. It was way overpriced for what you got. We ordered oysters as an appetizer and they were the size of a quarter is all.Our $40 steaks came out room temperature and the side lobster we ordered came in a soup bowl looking thing. SO for twenty some dollars you got just pieces of lobster. I would rather have paid $50 more and gone to Mastros City Hall where the food is mouthwatering and the steaks come out still cooking on your plate. You definitely go here for the view and not the food!"}
{"text":"Started off with the cheese plate, corn soup and pear salad! Tasty delights! I had the Elk, it was delish! My husband had lamb and he said it was great! We ordered side of Kale and sweet potatoes, both are excellent side dishes! Had the chocolate tort with ice cream for dessert - kind of like chocolate and peanut butter! We made reservations for a private booth. It was nice, except you could hear both the piano guy and the piped in 60s music, it was horrible music! Food was great, view ways nice, service impeccable! Save your pennies, it is expensive but makes a Great date night!"}
{"text":"Great food and a very nice place. Made reservations for two which was a requirement to get a table but after arriving it was apparent that many tables were open. Service was good. Drink menu has a nice list of cocktails and wine. Disappointed in the dinning room because smaller tables were too large and the layout made it difficult to have an intimate dinner."}
{"text":"Atmosphere/view is fantastic.  The service was just Ok. This was third visit in 6 years and always hope the food will be better. However, 3 strikes and you're out. We won't be back."}
{"text":"The real reason to dine here is the experience dining in a romantic private booth.  You sit in a high-back booth facing the window on The 15th floor of the Talking Stick Resort & Casino.  The booths are separated by curtins and significant space so you never see anyone but your waiter and seldom hear other conversations.  Plan on spending about $100/person.  The food was good but not to die for.  We had martinis with blue cheese olives, raw oysters, diver scallops, pork chop, loaded baked potato, and the lemon/lime curd desert.  The service was friendly and frequent but not as professional as I expected."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience.  Disappointed we were t able to sit by the window to view the beautiful sunset but we sat near the bar and had enough window to see the sights.  Our waiter was great, delivered our drinks, and left us alone as instructed. We wanted to take our time. But little did we know the long high top table would soon be filled with a party of 24 guys. They were a bit loud, underdressed(some), and unaware that there were people around them trying to have a nice meal/conversation. Didn't quite spoil or time there but definitely brought down the evening. Our food was delicious."}
{"text":"Had my anniversary dinner here on a Thursday evening at 6:30pm, just in time to watch the sun set from a private dining booth, shades drawn at the precise moment the sun sets. Amazing from food to staff to setup...well done.   Update: had my anniversary dinner there again this year - just as awesome!!!"}
{"text":"WE had a great time,great food and excellent service . Ask for Maggie to be your server! She was most excellent as was the rib eye steak. Our thanks to all from the lady whom made our reservations to Maggie who took care of our every need. Ruth and I had a wonderful time. Bo & Ruth Simon."}
{"text":"I will give 2 stars only because I really liked the location, the restaurant itself is nice, modern, spacious & has a nice view..  However, I think the prices are too high for the quality & taste of the food. I had to 'try' to like everything..  Starters= mediocre  Salad= bad  (Steak) Entree= horrible !!  Dessert= boring menu, so we ordered 3 different things hoping to like One, also very mediocre :/  The kitchen really needs to step it up!"}
{"text":"Romantic views- dining & service has room for improvement!  We stayed at the talking stick and went to this restaurant on a Sunday night. There is a private elevator and cocktail lounge right outside the hostess area.  As we are being seated our host asks if we would like a private room.  We said that sounded nice as we had never dined alone like that.  We had a spacious booth with a view to the west- not the most amazing ever but not too shabby.  We started with a bottle of red wine and the chefs cheese selection which was lovely.  Our server was a young confident guy who uncorked our wine perfectly.  He did explain the items in the chefs selection.  For mains the dish I wanted was sold out (sea bass) so I opted for the roasted chicken.  I wasn't starving and wanted something lighter than steak. This dish did not disappoint or thrill me.    My hunny had the demonico steak medium which was cooked nicely & seasoned.  He choose the horseradish sauce which wouldn't be my top choice but I could at least enjoy the 1 bite I tried.  *Overall our service was extremely extremely slow  *the music was a top 40 mix including Ke$ha and boy bands... I did comment to our main server about it.  It did not set an elegant tone and felt as if we were in there too late so the servers pick the music.  I don't classical music necessarily just something made for grown adults.  This is supposedly this elegant spot but it didn't feel like it.   Our server did invite us to enjoy the patio which was nice & we really would have rather sat out in the gorgeous spacious open patio.  Next time we will be sure to sit out in the open so they can see when we need service."}
{"text":"My fiance and I ate here last weekend for his birthday, and we are so very glad we stopped by to give them a try!  The walk alone to the restaurant is very cool! First you walk through the casino into a glass enclosed room with 2 elevators and a desk in front of them. There will be someone there to guide you to which floor you need to go to, and it just kind of adds to the experience. Once you go up the elevators there is another large open room with many windows in which you can see the whole city from. Very cool. The ladies at the front desk will confirm your reservation and will walk you through another room with a piano, couches, a very stylish bar, and a glass enclosure full of bottles of various types of wines and champagnes. A gentleman will then lift a velvet red rope for you to pass through as you walk to your table.   The actual restaurant is gorgeous - it has the most beautiful finishes all over, small details, large floor to ceiling windows with a view of the city, a romantic fireplace, and an amazing outdoor patio with comfortable seating and an infinity pool.  All this and we haven't even discussed the food!!!! The food is prepared with so much care there and you can tell the chefs are very mindful of their work. The service is top notch. We started with some drinks; I ordered some sort of tequila-based drink off of their cocktail menu and it was flavorful and delicious. My date ordered a drink similar to an old fashioned and while it was sweet, it was still very good.   We drank out on the patio until our crab cake appetizer was ready (our server came out and let us know). The crab cake was very good, but nothing to rave about. The salads however were a very unexpected amazing surprise! I had an arugula salad with berries and pomegranate seeds and some sort of citrus dressing and it blew my mind. My fiance ordered a Cesar and it was so light and delicious.   For the main course, I ordered the scallops which were so delicate and savory that I have been craving them this past week! He ordered the lamb and he said it was the best he has ever had. We shared the chili potatoes which were so delicious.   The waiter brought out a small piece of cake and fruit for dessert, on the house because it was a special birthday dinner. I was skeptical of the cake because most cakes at restaurants taste about the same, but this was truly the best chocolate cake I have ever had. it was rich and creamy and the mousse was to die for. Even though it was very small, it was more than enough and was the perfect end to our experience at Orange Sky.   I definitely recommend trying this place out for any special occasion, romantic dinner, or adult celebration. Make sure you make a reservation and try to come at sunset if possible. You will not be disappointed!!!!"}
{"text":"Whoever was answering the phones on 2/1/17 at 6:30 (was a male) was extremely RUDE!!!! Not accommodating AT all and I could barely understand the guy, looking forward to management response ....this was a small request for a birthday surprise, extremely disappointing !!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner here last night.  The service was excellent and the food choices were superb.  It was an incredibly wonderful evening -- outstanding views!  Michael M."}
{"text":"This was my first time having dinner at this restaurant with my boyfriend and another couple for a late Valentines dinner. Our experience from beginning to end was incredible! Since we were all very unfamiliar with the menu, our waiter Demetrio took the time to explain the restaurant favorites as well as entree's he recommended. The wine was great and entrees were delicious! I really enjoyed that Demetrio was being very attentive with us by making sure our food was fit for our liking as well as our drinks throughout our night. I would recommend this location to anyone that would like to experience exceptional service while enjoying a beautiful sunset view."}
{"text":"I've seen this place, but never tried it out until last Friday!  What a great experience. The staff was friendly, the food was delicious and the view was spectacular!  We then headed downstairs to the main lobby to listen to the band before going up to the 17th floor club.  Overall a memorable experience. We will surely do this again soon!"}
{"text":"Very very very yummy! It isn't on the cheap side but was worth it! Plus the view is just amazing!"}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere and being able to go out on the patio why waiting for appetizers to come.  Great photo opps with Camelback mountain.  Steak and sides were very good and similar quality to a Flemings type steak.  The seafood tower appetizer was disappointing compared to Maestros and just as expensive, would not recommend it."}
{"text":"Go here only if you wish to celebrate a special occasion ! Fantastic views (of the desert but beautiful nevertheless - beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder) but just about average tasting food.  Their shrimp is like a prawn (i.e. bigger in size for the uninformed, not your regular shrimp size). Pricey Pricey Pricey. They have a great outdoor seating area as well. Like I mentioned earlier - special occasions only so that you can remember the place. Else the food makes it quite forgettable."}
{"text":"Great service and ambiance!!  All of the food was fantastic with two exceptions.  The TAJIMA WAGYU STRIPLING was  good steak, but not great which you would expect for the price.  The SHRIMP AND SCALLOP STEAKS were good, but the bacon was not crisp, and the presentation was a little cumberson."}
{"text":"We just had dinner this evening at Orange Sky for Valentines day. We frequent this restaurant for special occasions and sometimes just to have a great dinner. We enjoy the ambiance the decor and atmosphere and of course, the great food!!! Tonight was no different. I ordered the New York strip with the red wine reduction sauce, and my girlfriend had the alaskan king crab legs. Everything was delicious as always!! We had a great server too, his name was Bradford. Very warm and gracious and very attentive when my girlfriend requested a wine that was she was not able to find on the menu, he took the time to look over the menu and was able to find the wine we requested by her just explaining what the bottle label looked like. It really showed how committed he was to ensure that we got what we wanted. He was very knowledgable about the  menu and really had a grasp of the assortment of cheeses on our artisan cheese board. Very impressed.  We will certainly be requesting Bradford again next time we dine at the Orange Sky.  The only reason we did not give 5 stars is that we were not seated till about 35 minutes after our reservation time. (but again, it was a crazy valentines evening) one of the busiest dining out nights. And the other although has nothing to do with the restaurant, but again still apart of the total experience of Talking Stick Resort, the valet attendant (short overweight guy with a beard) was very snooty and disrespectful. But hey you can win it all. Overall I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant and our server Bradford."}
{"text":"Excellent food, awesome view, great atmosphere.  The best part was our server Maggie, she was the highlight! Very knowledgeable about the menu, super helpful with any recommendations, and even a great resource for other places to check out around town. She definitely took? the experience from great to amazing, thanks Maggie!"}
{"text":"We went with my parents and uncles who came into town. It's a great environment. Very fancy! I think the only reason why it wasn't a 5 was because it seemed a bit over priced for the menu/portions/sides not included. We also inquired about the booth for fancy romantic dinners and they said the minimum to spend is $200. I believe I read somewhere on here it was $120 but they have obviously changed that! On the bright side we had an awesome server!"}
{"text":"I've been to Orange sky many times before we always get the private booth. It's funny the last time I came in my hair was superlong so I wore a hat because I really cannot do anything with it ha ha. When I got there they told me I have to take my hat off to walk through which I get but it was funny the looks I get with crazy hair hahah. Food was not as good as it has been in the past and the server was good but her Buser had absolutely no personality He would not talk to you even when speaking to him just extremely quiet so you really couldn't ask him for anything he would look at you and Maybe nod. kind of strange. The server later so that he is just quiet."}
{"text":"Our first time at orange sky, lived up to its name the sunset was incredible. About the food we had the lamb and the scallops and shrimp both were excellent but the special for the night on sides was lobster risotto and it was outstanding. We will certainly return with friends!"}
{"text":"Based on the reviews, I was really excited about coming here for my 30th but I guess I chose the wrong night to come with my wife. We showed up at 7:50p for an 8p reservation in a private booth. There's only 8 of them in the whole restaurant. The hostess comes to us at 8:05 and says our table is ready and begins to bring us to the back of the restaurant, not where we had reserved. When we said this isn't where we reserved, the bitchy hostess says \"We're fully committed.\" What kind of a response is that especially when we reserved a spot. She said if we wanted to wait longer, we can have a private table. We decided to wait, and wait, and right before my 31st birthday the manager came over and said its going to be another 20-30 min. It's now 8:50p. I explained the situation and he apologized and said he'd comp a few drinks and apps. We settled and sat at a table and 10 minutes in he came over and said he'd love to move us to a private now because the couple before us left. He continued to explain they were there for almost 5 hours. We moved and began to order food.   Salt Block shrimp was good not great. Very fishy tasting so you can tell it wasn't as fresh as it could be.   Black truffle gnocchi and crushed potatoes were bland and needed salt.   12oz tenderloin was actually pretty good. I ordered medium and it was on the rare side.   The pan roasted chicken was really good.   Waitress was very nice but seemed robotic and not personable.   $250 later, 2 stars."}
{"text":"So disappointing! There for a special occasion, had reservation weeks in advance for a sunset dinner. Get there and they gave away our groups table. Tried to give us a table next to wall in the middle of the room. Some view.... Kitchen, wall and break your neck to look outside.... Took us back to the bar to wait for another table so we had to watch the sunset from the bar, an hour later we got to sit down... First impression was not the best. No apology, but we all got one free drink..."}
{"text":"Well I went to have a nice dinner. It was nice. I had table 24 which was supposedly a great table with a minimum spend to reserve of $200. The view was good but would have preferred on the other side of the restaurant.   Food was good, what would be expected from a nice place. I got waygo at $70-80ish a steak... being from Detroit, we have a good steak house scene, so maybe high expectations. Elyssa the waitress was great.   Overall good; nothing stood out other than the high bill. Bathrooms were pretty sweet that you could see the mountains. That was a definite plus."}
{"text":"The first time I went here was in August/September 2015.  I am waiting for the day to go here again! Service is great and the food is even better! I love their calamari,King crab, and even their sparkling water (the one from New Zealand)!! The view is phenomenal! I understand why it's called Orange Sky because when the sun is setting. . .you get a great view! I would totally recommend this to anyone and everyone!! And when friends from out of town come to visit, I'm taking them here. :D"}
{"text":"Went on wedding anniversary, food was okay. Wife had pork chop and I had lamb, and for sides au gratin potatoes and asparagus. Service wa okay little lagging, as in checking on us and refills.... This not  a cheap spot, so forgive me if I expect a little better service. The highlight is the views, and we did not even have the private dining facing the windows, we were seated in general dining area, but hostess placed us on a good spot. Apologize if harsh review, but supposed to be about the food not sightseeing."}
{"text":"Unique menu, great quality and service, beautiful views.   First time I ordered the elk with carrot pur√©e and was pleasantly surprised. It was cooked perfectly and presented beautifully.   For my most recent visit, I again ordered an item I wouldn't normally choose -- crab legs. Again, cooked to perfection and bonus, they arrive already shelled. They gave me a large portion, too - I think 7-8. We also shared the crushed potatoes with artichokes which were delicious.  Oh, and we shared the pistachio and blackberry cake for dessert - very light, not too sugary, more of a torte and definitely a good choice.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The lobster here is to die for, don't look at the menu... just order it. Thank me later. It's so yummy, we had a family style dinner. So we had steak, lobster, broccolini, oysters, shrimp cocktail and It was all so good. My mouth is watering just thinking about that delicious meal. The view is amazing, we took photos at the end of the night with our bellies full!"}
{"text":"I recently had the pleasure of having my birthday dinner at the Orange Sky restaurant, located at Talking Stick Resort. What a fabulous experience! The wonderful restaurant manager, Kristina P., was so professional and friendly when I called to arrange the reservations and made it very special. She made sure that our view and table was one of the best. I have to mention that pretty much all of the tables have outstanding views of the desert mountains and gorgeous sunsets, hence the name, Orange Sky. The food was outstanding, and we are picky! The menu selection is one of the best and will cater to fish, beef, vegetarian, and chicken lovers, so many options! Some of my favorites were the seafood appetizer platter, the green chili mashed potatoes, and the scallops! Kyle, our waiter, was so personable and informative. He really made sure about having no nuts on anything at the table, we have a nut allergy. The service overall was magnificent, from the minute you arrive. If you ask where the ladies room is, they actually walk you to it. I want to credit, Kristina, for hiring and training a great staff! Thank you to the great chef too! We will be back when visiting AZ!  P.S. There is a gorgeous huge outdoor deck with the most perfect opportunities to take pictures with a beautiful back drop!"}
{"text":"This was a special day as it was my daughters birthday. They gave her extra attention, great meat, window table and then brought out a cake with Happy Birthday on it. Very very pleased--love this place."}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel in the sky! Unremarkable over priced food presented on plain white plates. While the service was fine, the view from our private dinning booth at sunset was non existent. The only way to watch the sunset was to leave our booth, traverse the dining room and walk out on the patio, not exactly what you would expect when you agree to pay the $200 minimum for the private dining/sunset experience.  As for the food, the $12.50 Caesar salad could have come from Denny's, the bread plate included just two varieties of sliced bread, no rolls, nothing special at all. The appetizer cheese board tasted fine but again the presentation was lacking. I ordered the rib eye steak, it could be cut with a sharp knife and some effort preceding a long chew!  I also opted for the \"Oscar\" sauce for my steak. I expected a seafood mixture in a tasty sauce to compliment my steak, what I got was two pieces of crab, each about the size of my index finger, resting on top of the steak and a bowl of some sort of sauce. I should note that this was an \"off menu item\" thus no price was listed. It was $32, ridiculous, even for this place! Lesson learned, next time I'll spend a little more and dine at KAI."}
{"text":"Orange Sky was OK.  I wasn't blown away by the ambiance, food, or customer service.  Everything was just OK.  There are a lot of great restaurants here in the valley and if you are going to pay top dollar to eat at one of them, I wouldn't recommend this place.  It doesn't take a special occasion or an event for me to splurge or treat my lady to a nice dinner.  If I'm going to drop 200 to 300 for a nice dinner, the food and service should be excellent.  My lady and I requested a table with a view, the view was nothing special, it was looking out towards topgolf and the 101.  The food quality was very average.  My steak was no better than a Keg Steakhouse or even a Longhorn's for that matter.  I wasn't pleased with our sides either.  All and all not a memorable experience and very mediocre food and service.  My recommendation, if you are going to spend a pretty penny on dinner, avoid this place and go to a Maestro's or Dominick's."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Orange Sky.  We loved the restaurant and the ambiance.  Our server Demetrio was friendly, attentive and knowledgeable.  My husband and I both ordered the Twin Tournedos of Beef and both were done to our liking.  I would also recommend the Cauliflower Gratin and the side of Mushrooms.  We plan to return soon."}
{"text":"If I could give it ten stars, I would - perfect corn soup, perfectly cooked steak. However, the sommelier was top notch - consulted on wines and never condescended. We ordered a $$$ bottle of wine at his suggestion. He opened it, decanted it, and pronounced it corked. He apologized, and did not assume that we wouldn't notice. Brought a second, and it was perfect.   Even though you have to go through the stinky casino, it's a different world up there.  We're saving all of our dining out pennies to eat here."}
{"text":"this is one of  the best restaurant I been to food wise stated off with the cheese board and the quail salad cheese board had a good cheese selection goat cheese blue cheese the honey was grate and the Chery sperm was amazing   they only give you 4 bread pieces I had to ask for more twice the quail salad was really good cook perfectly all dark meat then had a cocktail the first one was awesome the second was not good and I think they for got the booze for 15 bucks not good now for my dinner had the elk so good the best that I ever had no game flavor at all super tinder and the puree that Match perfectly wife had the lamb chop she said that they had to much fat the views are grate sit outside so you can watch sun set now the service is how they lost a star why did I need to asked repeatedly for more water and more bread and it was windy my napkin blow away and you ask if I need a new one yes I do over all the service does not match this restaurant I was kinda sloppy will definitely go back it is a grate place to celebrate any event"}
{"text":"This is my third year back to Orange Sky. It only gets better every year. The view of the valley is absolutely beautiful and one of my top 3 restaurants for special occasions. If you're on a date, private dining is a must!  The food is amazing and the portions are spot on.  Demetrio is a great server and very personable and I would highly recommend him!"}
{"text":"This place is wayyy overrated service is exceptionally slow and waaayyy over priced I have had better meals at bars.  Not worth going at all."}
{"text":"My meal was mediocre at best. Although my ribeye's presentation was fine, it lacked flavor.  I also had a sweet potato and a califlower side dish.  Believe it or not, both of them were as bland as the steak.  I am certain that they have some better dishes on their menu, I just would not recommend the three that I've mentioned."}
{"text":"I had the elk loin and my wife had the bison. Both were very good. The elk was one of the best tasting meats I ever had. The bison was a little bland and tough comparatively. My wife and I share an accompaniment of cauliflower with cheddar which was very bland.  They also have no beers on tap which is an automatic deduction for me. I would go back. The price is as suggests. Expect to pay $150-200  per couple."}
{"text":"Dinner was very delicious! The service was phenomenal. The cauliflower Au gratin was to die for!"}
{"text":"Service was spot on and the staff was very friendly.  Restaurant was clean, inviting, and professional.  Food was AMAZING!!  This was our second time here and we will definitely be coming back.  Kudos Talking Stick and Orange Sky!"}
{"text":"We were there for my husbands birthday.  It was amazing.  The staff was so very friendly.  The Elk dish was delicious!  The wine list amazing.  The views were fabulous.  A must go to 5 Star Restaurant!"}
{"text":"Pretty bummed out. It was my boyfriends birthday plus people in town. Party of 7. I picked here bc its been great in past. Waited 15 minutes or so to have a server. We're a big group how can you miss us? Finally flagged someone down. He didn't seem happy with my questions bc of special diet needs. Sorry. Then the lady w the wine RUDE. At least food was still good but bummed."}
{"text":"I'm usually not one to complain when a great meal is paid for by someone else, in this case my generous brother in law Rick Randall. Tuesday September 30th was his birthday and we were all in a great mood looking forward to some excellent food!  I will also state right up front, the food was pretty great, but read on to see why I give it 2 stars...  The view from the top of the casino is really awesome, and upon first entering the restaurant you are taken aback by the shear size and fantastic aesthetics this place offers. Based on the ambiance, this was going to be good!  The wine list is incredible, and includes some very unique \"off the beaten path\" greats such as Rob and Sarah Hammelman's SAND RECKONER Malvasia Bianca, 2010, which made the San Francisco Chronicle's Top 100 Wines in the USA a couple years back. The reason that's remarkable is because it's an Arizona Wine, which have traditionally gotten very little \"love\" in local high class eateries.  Upon arrival about 10 minutes early for our reservation at 7pm, we waited nearly 15 minutes to be seated at our table. Once sitting, we were brought water, and waited another 10 minutes before our waiter showed up.   Unfortunately, the (delayed) first impression was further tainted by his breath, which was scorching. I couldn't help but wonder how a person who's job it is to serve food and drink could allow their breath to be that repulsive without noticing.   I didn't get our waiter's name, but he was a middle-aged hispanic man and my first discussion with him was focused on the fact that I (unfortunately) have Celiac Disease.   Not \"gluten-intollerance\", but the real clinically diagnosed version of the disease.  He ASSURED us up and down that any of the fresh meats, cheeses, vegetables, etc. were gluten-free, and that he would \"personally talk to the Executive Chef\" to make sure my food was properly prepared and didn't contain any gluten ingredients.  Long story short, they brought out the Fondue Platter, which I very much enjoyed dipping my veggies into. At one point, as they were clearing the various appetizers I asked him to leave the fondue cheese because I wanted to use it as a garnish for my rib-eye (which was perfectly cooked and delicious, by the way).   The waiter, knowing I was Gluten-Free exclaimed cheerfully \"WHY NOT? LOL\".  About 10 minutes after eating that cheese (along with some fresh seafood, which was also very good) I started to feel nauseous.   Our waiter had walked over and asked me how everything was, and I said \"fine other than the fact that I feel like I'm going to toss my cookies\". He just blankly turned and walked away in spite of the fact I actually said this with a smile on my face.  Within 15 minutes of eating a few bites of the steak with the delicious fondue cheese on it, I started to feel violently ill and had to excuse myself from the table.  I walked over to the single toilet by the kitchen, locked the door, and once inside proceeded to expel my guts for what seemed like an eternity. It was really unpleasant and embarrassing due to the stench and sound I was generating, to say nothing of how I felt physically (for two days).  Long story short, that cheese in the fondue had Grolsch Beer in it. A gluten-rich source of explosive vomit and diarrhea for me.  Our waiter was utterly incompetent and it cost me dearly.  I think the food here is delicious and deserves to be served by people who know what they are doing, and take verbally communicated food allergies VERY seriously.  I would give the food 4 stars (not 5 only because the appetizers are jokingly small for how much they cost) and an overall 2 stars for the explosive experience and incompetence of the waiter."}
{"text":"This evenings meal exceeded all expectations. The decor was the best in Phoenix, the service was A1 and the menu was fantastic! If you can imagine, a Old School Vegas atmosphere. Patrons were dressed up and I thought I had passed thru a time machine. Kudos to the host !!  Vince"}
{"text":"We still enjoyed our visit, but we had a steak that was overdone and I expect better if it going to be fine dining.  Everyone was sorry, but that was it.  I would expect them to do better when paying that much.  I think their service needs better rhythm as well.  It seemed they were at our table a lot but we still had to ask for things.  Great servers don't have to ask you what you need and you don't have to tell them.  They see it and bring it.     The Pecan Tart was very good.  I probably would not get the mushroom risotto again but I am addicted to the au gratin pototo and the truffle baked potato was a hit at our table."}
{"text":"Ordered a half dozen oysters. They were the smallest oysters I have ever seen. Paper thin as well. If you put 3 together it wouldn't even equal 1 normal oyster. I would have been embarrassed to serve that if I had a restaurant. I live in Phoenix and come here often. It is a beautiful place, but if you want oysters go to ocean trail on the casino level. I returned them and they were taken off the tab. But everything else is wonderful there."}
{"text":"I've been here before and it was awesome.  Lasts night was totally different. After being sat we waited 10 mins just for the server to come over. We ordered a cocktail, received it and didn't see our server again. After 20 mins we decided to ask to be moved. Once inside we received the server we come to know at the orange.  We also stayed at the talking sticks resort after leaving the orange and walking back to our room we were stopped to show our room key before getting onto the elevators, which wasn't an issue until three other couple and one women walked right pass without showing anything were able to just go ahead. Needless to say I think we were profiled. Never experienced that before. It didn't feel good."}
{"text":"Loved the view from the 15th floor of Orange Sky.  Just amazing mountain views which are not to be missed.  We started with a blood mary which thanks to our server, Ellysa, was made perfectly --nice and spicy.   Cesar salad was made with avocado dressing with avocado oil and while it sounded interesting, it was just ok.  The star of the show was the Elk, a medium rare filet (of Elk) on a bed of polenta with mushrooms and onions.  Never had Elk before and never had anything so good either.  The skirt steak was charred yet delivered medium rare.  Such a tender piece of skirt steak that I couldn't get over it.  The sides were amazing--- green chili mashed potatoes were so good I would venture to say that they were the best mashed potatoes I ever had.  The asparagus with garlic and lemon zest was most enjoyable.  Loved the flourless chocolate cake but the milk chocolate mousse not so much.  The service was impeccable yet friendly.  Thank you Ellysa.  We appreciated your great service."}
{"text":"I would rate it as a 4 star if the food was better ! I think its a perfect pick for a special day dinner..................................Anniversary, Birthday, Valentine etc. Great ambience ............very elegant, great views from the balconies/patio and upscale feel. Food was average..........Appetizers and the wine list is good but the main course itself just didn't make it for us ! I must say the location of this restaurant is perfect since its in the Talking Stick resort / Casino so you have an option to either go clubbing right after dinner, hang around at the trendy lounge or even go try your luck with gambling !"}
{"text":"The atmosphere makes the dining experience. Our table sampled the oysters, muffalata, scallops,  filet and veal chop. A few bottles of wine and comp dessert we left spending a small fortune for a table of four. Service is pleasant but slow - I think intentionally as it sets the mood. If you want a private booth during peak season book in advance."}
{"text":"Deeply disappointed. This was a very special occasion and someone who is a part time chef recommended it.  Got there right after sunset on a week night. Completely dead. The whole dinner was rushed. The server, Amy, kept coming back to tell us this that and just talked way too much. We did not come to see her.  The entrees were super fast even before the wine?!  The restaurant itself was beautiful and the private booths would be a real treat but I doubt there will be a next time. The king crab was swimming in sauce and was $50 with not that much of a portion. The salmon was  undercooked.  We were comparing this to the ocean club...not for long as the ocean club always had great king crab and anything else on the menu."}
{"text":"Horrible experience for a $500 dinner tab for 4 people and it was a special occasion. Upon checkin was told our table was in the main dining room then a second hostess stand told us we were on the patio. We took a peek and decided to keep the patio seating. What we weren't told was that the service was second rate out there...had to continually track down our waiter  Thomas and at one point had to actually walk inside and tell him how tired I was of having to keep trying to track him down.  He had no personality, we had to ask for our appetizer, salad and dinner plates to be removed. Had to ask twice to have our heater turned on. Our salads were placed in front of the wrong people. Asparagus came to the table cold. Long wait for an antipasto appetizer. As far as the bar goes we had to ask for napkins for our cocktails and the outfits of the staff were disheveled and not the caliber of \"fine dining\" hype we expected.  We are local residents and I have never left a review but was so incredibly disappointed I had to let others know. Heading out...our party( who arealso discussed how typically you see managers walking around in fine dining restaurants askin patrons how their dinner is and no one came out to check on us at all. Overall, with all the wonderful nicer restaurants in this town that are grateful that locals provide them business...this is surely one to miss."}
{"text":"Surprised my Parents with a special stay at the casino and dinner at Orange Sky for their 30th Anniversary.  The restaurant was accommodating for our large party and even put some festive confetti on our table (which I provided in advance) to liven up the party.  Upon arrival to this breathtaking restaurant, we were seated with a nice view of the city.  I was expecting even more, but was overall pleased with our seat and the view around us.  The wait staff was pleasant and served our party in an appropriate manner.  All of the food was cooked well, however my Dad chomped down on a piece of glass in the cauliflower side dish we ordered.  He was pretty upset at first, but the manager handled this situation (offering to call an ambulance - which was not necessary).  Though the glass in food incident did put a slight damper on things, the staff made up for it by taking two entrees off the bill and also gave a complimentary Anniversary dessert.  Overall, was I blown away by my steak/sides... no, not really, but the service and ambiance made up for it.  The food was on par with what I would expect for the price, so in the end I was quite happy with this dining experience and my Parents loved the surprise and raved about everything besides the glass (LOL)."}
{"text":"Food was creative and well prepared, although appetizers were served lukewarm and not hot. Entrees were flavorful and fish / meats were cooked exactly as ordered.  Presentation of dishes was attentive and enjoyable.   Other than Fran, our extremely professional server, staff was consistently awkward and disengaged. The disinterested temperament of the bulk of the staff, combined with the terrifically smoky mandatory walk through the casino will moderate our future interest in returning."}
{"text":"I was extremely excited to try Orange Sky, but ended disappointed with the entire experience.  It is fitting that this is a casino restaurant; lots of flash, little substance.  Orange Sky will not be the closer alternative to Kai that I had hoped for.  The $125 per plate prix fixe meal included appetizer, salad, main, and dessert.  No wine pairing option was available, though the server did try to match glasses from their  limited by glass wine list.  There was no sommelier, and even the full bottle list was limited.  A \"complimentary\" glass of sparkling was definitely not a high quality.  Note to Orange Sky:  I would prefer glass of good sparkling poured halfway (normal), rather than a cheap sparkling poured to the rim.  The appetizers were both wonderfully plated.  My abalone was good, and my wife's lobster and risotto was excellent, but felt a little heavy on the cream for an appetizer.  Endive salads were simply average.  The standard lemon sorbet between salad and main was a large scoop in a small dish garnished with a mint leaf and berry.  It was awkward to eat with a spoon too large for the dish.  Main courses were both extremely well cooked lamb and beef, both a perfect medium rare.  Portions of meat were unusually large.  They were let down by the sides that neither paired well nor  were particularly well executed.  My poached pair dessert had a great flavor, but serving was not well thought out as it was difficult to eat."}
{"text":"This was a top-notch place - makes up for the rest of this \"not-so-top-notch\" resort and casino.  Service was polite and attentive, the view was incredible, and the food was delicious.  Pricey, but very very good.  We went here for my birthday, and we were brought a little birthday dessert after our meal.  We started with oysters, I had an elk dish, my wife had scallops.  All were terrific.  We also really liked the sides we chose - the potatoes and the mushroom tart.  Good drink list as well, especially if you like cocktails.  Overall we'd say we'll return, but can't make it a regular \"go-to\" place as it's not cheap."}
{"text":"Fancy restaurant, littering pricy but the steak is so tender and juicy. Beautiful view, nice when you're have special occasion and so romantic."}
{"text":"My friend took me to dinner here last night. The view is absolutely breathe taking. He ordered us steak and salmon which was amazing. The service was excellent and our server had personality, which is nice because typically at high end restaurants its been my experience staff can be rigid or uptight. If you are in the Scottsdale area definitely try this restaurant out. There is a casino on the lower level if you are interested in gambling after."}
{"text":"The thing I hear most about Orange Sky is the view at sunset - which is terrific.  However the service and quality of food is what made the night fantastic.  Our server LIv was amazing - and her recommendations were spot on.  The entire staff was exceptionally attentive.  We chose to share four appetizers to get as many tastes as possible.  The shrimp and scallop steaks wrapped in jalapeno bacon and adobo chili tenderloin are must haves!"}
{"text":"Great food and fast friendly service. Always have a good dinner there. Sorry to hear that you must  spend at least $200.00 to sit by the west windows to see the sun set over Camelback Mountain. You can still see the sunset from other tables so this policy is no big deal. Looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"We were in town to celebrate our wedding anniversary and decided to try this place. The food was absolutely incredible and the service did not disappoint"}
{"text":"We ate at the bar from the Orange Sky menu. I can't remember the last time I had a worse dinner! My wife had the ribeye I had the flat iron steak. Both were terrible. I'd rather eat at McDonalds. Both were dry and flavorless. Don't wast your time or money! What happened to this place? It used to be so good!!!"}
{"text":"Will was an incredible waiter.. The Elk was to die for... All was perfect!  A return visit is imminent!"}
{"text":"Went here a long time ago, Server was Kristen. She was so helpful and nice. The sliders were amaze balls. Talk about a view with a stick. cheers"}
{"text":"We came here for our anniversary dinner and were definitely not disappointed. Everything was great from the impeccable service to the wonderful food. My tenderloin was melt in your mouth delicious as was my husband's elk. Our server, Michelle, was the best. Fourth time we've been here and will definitely come back. And of course, don't forget the best view in the valley."}
{"text":"William is a first class waiter.  When Mark stopped by I explained to him our utter satisfaction and our impressed - ness of the facility he manages.  This tribe is doing great business and creating a great brand.  The tribe utilizes their own management techniques and the employees love to work here.   This Indian community is loyal to its people and the people love to patronize the establishment.  Talking Stick resort is a beacon to this region; a beautiful lace to get a cold drink in a thirsty occasion."}
{"text":"Wow what a view! As a guitarist to the celebrities I have been to a lot of great places around the world. Then I went to Orange Sky. The service I received was top notch and I could not have been happier. Mark the manager was one the best I have the pleasure dealing with. He made sure it was a night to remember. The servers were so polite and very knowledgeable of the menu. I was without a doubt impressed! I highly recommend anyone to go and just enjoy a beautiful night there. I know you will be impressed with Mr. Mark Kieru and his staff just as much as I was.  #famouslyunknownguitarist"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant with beautiful food and views. I had an unforgettable birthday here in a private booth.  I had lobster while my gf had crab legs and they were both perfect. This rivals any other high end spot in az."}
{"text":"Phenomenal restaurant for a classy dinner with great service, world-class views, and amazing food. Best foie gras I've ever had. The sommelier was very knowledgeable and friendly. Get the couples booth for sunset - you WON'T be disappointed."}
{"text":"Tomato Bisque Soup with Bruschetta was awesome!! Great view and good live music. Also a great wine selection."}
{"text":"We went here for my girlfriends 30th birthday with another couple in one of their exclusive window booths... the views certainly lived up to the expectation! The food was great... and be aware of their minimum purchase requirement... but if you're having wine it's easy to hit. The service was great and the bar is a good place to grab a quick drink to start off the night... I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a great meal."}
{"text":"I am a regular and I enjoy this restaurant as my retreat after a long work week.  The views are truly romantic and the food is delightful.  I did some advanced planning and enjoyed a great Valentine's Day experience at Orange Sky.  The red wine, oysters and tenderloin were a perfect addition to the city lights and soft fire lit ambiance.  The building was illuminating a bright red heart that you could see from several miles away.  After the Valentine's dinner I was given a beautiful red rose.  Very nice touch by the staff.  I loved it!  I give it a 4 star because for the price, I feel they could step it up a notch with the plate presentation.  It's very plain and unappealing.  A few pretty garnishments would be more visually pleasing.   I plan on returning and I highly recommend Orange Sky for any special occasion or a great dinner out."}
{"text":"Beautiful View, Best Steak I've ever had in my life. Def will be going back, very impressed :)"}
{"text":"I ate dinner here on a super quiet monday night.  Lets start off with the ambiance 6/5...this is one of the nicest restaurants I have ever been to anywhere.  Minimalist decor, super, super spacious, many options including semi private couch seating for couples - all with incredible views of Scottsdale and sorrounding mountains....  Caesar salad 2/5 (it was the only food on the menu I did not care for as it had bacon and other non-traditional ingredients I did not like)  12 oz Filet 5/5 (medium rare plus)  Side order of mushrooms and cauliflour 5/5  Bread 4/5  Drinks 4+/5 (I only tried the original margarita) you can have whatever you like as most bars, but their list is comprised of traditional styled drinks (preparation the way they were originally conceived...)  Chocolate Dessert 5/5, special root beer dessert weak 2/5  Service 5/5  Pricing is fair and comparable to most upscale steak houses.   Bottom line...if you want the best steakhouse in Phoenix, maybe the camelback inn's BLT steak is still the best for steak (bone-in filet), an Ocean Club at Kierland (if you want more of a people watching, live music & open restaurant feel) But dont discard orange sky if you are looking for incredible views, in a super chic setting, with pretty good food and service."}
{"text":"Just finished an incredible meal!  Every morsel was cooked to perfection! Julio and Ramsey were exceptional servers.  Our private booth was the perfect way to celebrate our anniversary.  Highly recommend Orange Sky. ..ask for Julios section if you want to be spoiled!"}
{"text":"I love the ambiance this restaurant gives, especially when we reserve a private booth.  It's such a great setting to have dinner at sunset.  I order the Alaskan King Crab legs and they are absolutely amazing!  My husband has ordered the Lamb and that too was delicious.  As for side dishes, the Asparagus and the Whipped Potatoes are amazing.  The anniversary cake for dessert is also delicious as well as the seasonal blueberry cheesecake that we recently had.  Very expensive (we dropped about $200) however very worth it to us for a great night filled with amazing food and ambiance.  The wine is also a must have - great pairings!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience here at Orange Sky! The views are breathtaking, the food is divine and the service is out of this world! Our server, Julio was one of the best servers I think I've had ever before! He was very personable, friendly, professional and you can tell he genuinely enjoys his job! Thank you for a wonderful night!"}
{"text":"I made a reservation for my birthday two months prior to the date just to have a great dinner with my boyfriend.   48 hours prior to the reservation date I was notified that they are having a fixed menu only on my birthday.   This leaves me with no options for my birthday as I purposely made this reservation for their full menu.  When I splurge and plan that far ahead for an expensive meal I don't want anyone to only offer a fixed meal when I expect the full menu. Very disappointed.  I will never attempt to dine here again."}
{"text":"While at the Talking Stick Resort in Scottsdale Arizona. My Mom Brother and I dined at the Orange Sky Restaurant. Located on the 15th floor. With floor to ceiling windows all around. Beautiful view of the Mountains. Our server Elyssa did an outstanding job. She was knowledgeable on the menu. Happy and upbeat. Made you feel at home. Tryed a few new things. If you are ever at the Talking Stick Resort Scottsdale Arizona. Give the Orange Sky Restaurant a try. And if Elyssa is your server. You will have a fun and enjoyable vist."}
{"text":"This is the right place for a big date.  The restaurant has a wide open feel an provides a beautiful view night or day. The ambiance is stellar.  The waiter does not stand there and watch you eat, but I did feel like a high roller.  Dress up, grab the love of your life (and a credit card), and have a spectacular night out."}
{"text":"In a nutshell, reserve outdoors on the temperate evenings but don't fret if outdoor dining is not available. Order the filet rare. Add one of the bacon wrapped shrimp and scallops to come with the filet and get the green chili mashed potatoes.  You will not be disappointed!   My beautiful companion ordered a quinoa dish. I'm not a fan. My thinking is quinoa is usually a filler food for people that don't like real food and would rather be at the gym. (That's supposed to be funny.) But wow, that stuff was exceptional. If you can make quinoa taste good, for my thinking that starts you out at a three star rating.  I made my reservation a week in advance through Yelp but then followed up with a phone call asking to be seated outdoors on the northwest end.  Surprisingly, they took that request without question and attached it to my Yelp reservation.  No problem.  I wanted outdoors because the view is spectacular to the north.  It's not all that bad to the west but to the north at night you still get the city lights without peering across the parking lot between you and the view.  Don't get me wrong, there are no bad seats out there.  To the east is the resort pool and to both the north and east are golf course views visible in the daytime.  All the tables are centered by the ripple pool which is a sight all its own.  Now here's where they surprised me.  I got a call from them that afternoon before I was to be there. It was windy that day and they close the outdoor patio to dining on windy days. I had the opportunity to cancel. Darn good of them right? right!  When I got there I asked if they had an opening for one of their sweetheart tables. These tables are quasi private dining arrangements cozied up to a west facing window overlooking top golf, the diamondback spring training stadium and city lights.  Pretty sweet and worth the $200 min charge (Grab a bottle of wine and you're over with two of you.). They said sure, we could have a sweetheart table but they had me sitting at an indoor table right next to a huge fireplace and suggested I check that out first. It was wonderful!  Yet another great option for dining at Orange Sky.  My other suggestion is to order a drink first and head out onto the north end of the patio for a few minutes before your dinner starts to arrive. There are cushioned benches out there with the ripple pool behind you.  Very Nice.   Our server was Bradford. He was great. I highly recommend him. He had a tremendous grasp of the venue, the menu and the wine list. He greeted us at each interval with a smiling face and cheery disposition. He had quite a few tables but never left us unattended. My bill was $148 before tip. We had a perfect evening."}
{"text":"Food was ok, nothing great. My husband had the Elk which the server said was their best cut of meat and it was good. I had the halibut and it was good but again nothing I would order again. We had the sommelier come over to help us pick out a great bottle of wine. At first sip, after the cork was broken when the server opened it,  it was good but needed to open, well this bottle needed at least 3-4 hours to open, more time than we had for dinner. I finally asked the waiter for a decanter to see if that would help. I was never complaining because that happens when you order a bottle of wine. My husband finally just asked the server to bring me a different glass of wine because the meal was done and I really did not enjoy the wine. A manager, Nichole, came over that is clearly fresh out of being a server and had the attitude that we were trying to get something comped. I was blown away by how rude she was and could clearly care less.  I come from Fine Dining and 15 years of F&B so no one was trying to get anything comped but the treatment from the manager will definitely keep us away for good."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and every experience has been great.  Decided to have my 50th dinner with my best friend here.  It was her first time.  She enjoyed the dinner as well.  The shelled Alaskan King crab legs are delicious!  Also tried the mushroom bruchetta, a must.  The green chili whipped potatoes.   Yum!!  The birthday dessert was a gift from Orange Sky and it fabulous!  I will always come back for the views, service and food!  Thank you for making my 50th a full happy belly affair!"}
{"text":"We returned here for our 6 year anniversary in November and splurged on a private booth. I was pregnant at the time so we wanted to really enjoy ourselves knowing it'll be one of our last outings for awhile. I was set on getting the lobster entree again...I saved my one seafood a week meal for that night. Unfortunately we found out that they took it off the menu! But our waiter was awesome!! He made sure I got my lobster dinner. He spoke to the manager and they made a pregnant woman happy. It wasn't the same entree but it was a lobster dinner and that was good for me. I really do hope they bring the lobster entree back...it was the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Don't go just for the view.  Everything about it is excellent:  the cuisine, the server, the sommelier, the bartender - AND the view!  We've visited four or five times, and have always come away talking (stick) about what a great time we had.  This will be a favorite for a long time to come."}
{"text":"Took my hubby for his 46th birthday.  Staff was great & food was good.  Views were amazing!"}
{"text":"Thank yo for blessing our son, the evening of his graduation from ASU!   The food was amazing!"}
{"text":"Went to Orange Sky last night for the \"Inglenook\" winemaker dinner.   Can I say FABULOUS!!!   From beginning to end.   Great service,wonderful/flavorful food and amazing wines!    5 in all.   4 courses with 5 wines.   Francis Ford Coppola is doing a grand job of reviving the Inglenook name!   And O/Sky is doing a grand job of feeding Phoenix's foodies  ..... the eyes as well as the taste buds!!   A truly beautiful setting!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here for our Anniversary based on recommendations from friends and other reviews. The experience was great all around. The service was fantastic. The private booth along the window was perfect, and the food quality and presentation was also good. I would recommend to others."}
{"text":"Not your typical steakhouse menu. More of a specialty cuisine restaraunt since they have four cuts of beef and one is a cut that is used for fajita meat. No filet or bone in ribeye. The elk loin was very good, however it is served sliced so if its undercooked as mine was you would be left to wonder how will you put it back on the heat. Im not a fan of any slab of meat being cut up and served to me so a heads up on the menu would've been nice. Service was excellent and atmosphere was very elegant. Spent $240 on one Cesar salad and two elk loins, $13 brocollini and a very over cooked baked potato. Also had four beers. Not much for your money. You are paying for atmosphere and view. At night view is nothing but lights."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out on a random day of the week when there are no bands in town because it isn't a Friday or Saturday.  This restaurant has a lounge area which had a band on a Tuesday night and was fabulous to dance to.  I have gone twice and had a great experience both times but not necessarily because of the food.  I love the sustainably farmed salmon although I say it could have been improved with some amazing sauces and sides.  The problem with dishes that are not composed as is the case with the dishes here is when you pick your sides they don't necessarily pair well with the main entree.  My suggestion would be to carry a couple of dishes which are composed dishes and let them sing together in food harmony.  The second time I went I ordered the NY with horseradish cream sauce and devoured the entire steak.  Super YUM!!  Their wine list is vast which is good but at the same time, it leaves their servers with this huge amount of knowledge they will never be able to know.  They carry an amazing Arizona wine called \"Sand Reckoner\" but our server didn't know anything about it.  This is unfortunate because they could be selling local wines and especially when they are this good!!  When you get bored with the band upstairs, go down to the cigar lounge and enjoy a good solo singer who makes you want to get up and dance on the random day!  Enjoy a good cigar and a nice cordial.  Day finished sweetly."}
{"text":"Get the cheese board. It's loaded with fun stuff like various olives, cheeses and such. So good. We didnt sit in a private booth but still has an exceptional view of the city, 360 degrees. It has a laid back, elegant ambiance and prompt wait staff. Our waitress got to know us and we left feeling as though we had made new friend. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"After taking 15 minutes to get a drink in the cocktail lounge, it was not a good start.  It is worth going though, just for the ambiance and the piano bar, but be prepared for their $15 drink list.   We had a burratta that was good......The king crab was delicious and definitely worth the price.   I would stay away from the foie gras as the portion was just too small and just ok.   Probably won't be back, but  glad we tried it."}
{"text":"My family took me here for my birthday in April. We had a fantastic time and a memorable meal. We timed the reservation so the sun would set half way through dinner. The appetizers, entr√©es and desserts were grand. They have private booths you can reserve - perfect and private. Classy and elegant all the way..."}
{"text":"Came here for girls night! Everything was delicious, the atmosphere was spectacular. Beautiful views of the city and mountains."}
{"text":"I have been to orange a few times. They were offering a beef tenderloin served table size with a few sides. It was delicious. Views are amazing. Drinks are tasty."}
{"text":"Went for wife's b day. She had the halibut & I had the scallops. Both were very good.  Crazier salad was good, but average. Bread was ok. The side dish , that consisted of sweet potato, goat cheese, and walnuts, was absolutely amazing!  We spent $150 after tip. 2 salads, 2 sea food entrees, 2 drinks, 1 side dish = $129 + tip."}
{"text":"The manager on duty did what she could to make our reservation a success. However, the events manager scheduled the wrong time for the reservation. The manager on duty was very accommodating. However, there was only one waitress for the entire lounge area. It took forever to get drinks and food. There was also very little food to choose from which I was not made aware of at the time of booking the reservation when I specifically stated the party was going to be for dinner."}
{"text":"Went with another couple for the first time on 6-15-17.  The good points, 1) great ambiance and views and 2) Nice complimentary deserts for the birthday girls.  The less than good points, 1) Pricey, should have 4$ rating vice 3$. 2) Food cuts were good quality but the experience was soured by the rather meager serving sizes and spoiled by over spicing.  There was a hot and spicy component to nearly every entre'.  The soup, the salad, the sides, the steak, the steak sauce, and even the shrimp and scallops were notably hot and spicy.  It was almost if the Chef was from India and added curry or peppers to every component.    Service for such a high end place was OK but could have been better in explaining things and interacting.  You are paying for the views and ambience.  IMO to be an above average high end restaurant, this place needs to change the chef and give bigger portions for the money they ask."}
{"text":"A restaraunt with a higher rating would have brought you an extra breadstick for free, when you spend $650.  for dinner and drinks. Lack of class and being cheap is why they get only 3 stars. If they want to get 5 stars they need to treat customers like the Bourbon Steakhose at the Princess! Priced about the same, but they treat you better and are not \"chintzie\"."}
{"text":"For the price I would not recommend it, I ordered the shrimp, scallop entr√©e and it was extremely over cooked. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"What a wonderful dining experience! Food was perfectly cooked and hot. The aroma of the steak and seafood satisfied the pallete.  Environment is tranquil although lacking in view and architect considerations but none the less doesn't take away from a culinary feast of satisfaction. Service was attentive and ample."}
{"text":"A wonderful experience from beginning to end. Excellent, but non-obtrusive service, personable staff, substantial wine list. At our table we all shared a Caesar salad, pumpkin seed crusted shrimp, a scallop dish, a nice bottle of Petite Syrah, and a beef tenderloin. Everything was delicious. A complimentary birthday dessert was delivered complete with candles.  Make your reservation with the sunset time in mind. Ask for a west facing window or private booth facing the sunset. The experience is wonderful for a special occasion or a romantic dinner."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant with my wife for our anniversary based on a suggestion from someone (and confirmed that it was a decent choice via Yelp).  So, to start it's at Talking Stick Resort and it's on the 15th (top?) floor of the hotel.  The restaurant is the entire floor with the entrance area featuring a bar/lounge with live music for while you wait, you can also sit on one of the many balconies and enjoy the views.  Most of the seating wraps around the perimeter of the restaurant with floor to ceiling windows to enjoy the view.  Group seating and private groups are toward the middle.  We made 8:30 reservations and were seated by 8:40.  Our servers (yes two) were fairly prompt and attentive.  The main one that took our order had many suggestions and was able to answer any questions we had.  Ordered a Mojito cocktail.  Was decent, but a tad on the small side and light in the Alcohol.    We ordered the Lobser Bisque  which they placed into 2 bowls for us.  It was excellent.  We had been told that all the entries were large enough to share.  We got the pork chop which was delicious and plenty large enough to share.  All meals come with a choice of sauce, but based on the recommendation from the waiter, we skipped it which was an excellent suggestion.  The pork had plenty of flavor by itself and was very juicy.  We ordered the \"whipped potatoes\" as the side and those were large enough to be their own meal.  The sleeper hit was the dessert.  we ordered the chocolate mousse with raspberry sauce and raspberry  pop-rocks, yes the kids candy, pop-rocks.  It  was unbelievable!  Overall, very pleased.  Not an every-week type of place to visit, but definitely for special occasions.  Total seating time was about 90 minutes and bill was about $85 with drink and tip.    Tips: Reservation highly recommended (their reservation line is a voice mail box, left a message and they called back within an hour), request one of the private booths, and they do have a dress code (collared shirt, no ripped jeans)."}
{"text":"The service Lynn was perfect! Food excellent, view amazing! We loved every minute! Call to reserve a good table!"}
{"text":"Service was 6 stars out of 5!  Maggie was an awesome server, really friendly and met all of my annoying requests haha. Also, the busser was super attentive and my water was always full...much appreciated.   I brought my girlfriend with me Thursday night for a date and we both left very happy. The dessert (Strawberry Hisbiscus) was very good, the brussel sprouts salad was good (ill probably get a different dressing though next time...but bacon ving. was still fine.)  She got the skirt steak, cooked perfectly as ordered and tasted fantastic. My king crab was too much to finish. The presentation was awesome, deshelled and neatly arranged on plate. It wasn't the best King Crab I ever had, but I definitely found it tasty. I'll definitely be back eventually.   Overall, atmosphere and the service I got were perfect A+ grade and the food I'll rate a B+."}
{"text":"Wahlah! ...and then there was Orange Sky! They really pay attention to detail.  Make reservations people. This is not an establishment that you just show up at and expect to get a private room with an aerial view of this great county. You can name drop. They don't care. You're not getting past the bar...we've tried! So that being said, we've sat at the bar on several occasions and listened to the sultry sounds from the pianist.  My last visit, Mr. O'Zandra made reservations. Wh-what?! I couldn't believe the views as we walked down the corridor to our table. The patio dining was amazing! The staff was very attentive and knowledgeable of the menu. The food was perfectly prepared.  Nice date night choice!"}
{"text":"My husband brought me for my birthday. He had made reservations and we were seated right away. We ordered a cheese board for an appetizer which was very over priced. We ordered our entrees and after over an hour of waiting, were told by the manager our server was new. Maybe you should have better training!!! They offered to bring our food & comp our meal, but we were finished. We paid for our cheese board & left. What a disappointment, especially after my husband planned a nice evening out!"}
{"text":"I feel as if this restaurant is losing ground. We don't go often and six months after our last visit we could see a difference. On the positive side, our service was great. The waiter was experienced and knowledgeable. He gave some good advice. The assistant waiter was attentive. The wine list was the same with decent value among overpriced selections. The vodka martinis are great. The ribeye steaks were excellent: not best in the valley but good quality for price. The desserts were decent quality though a little high priced. The sides sounded better than they were in real life. We had five at our table of four and none tasted good. The salads were a disaster: ingredients tired and dressing not right. This was our fourth visit but the first time we felt we had a poor, overpriced meal. I know they can do better so can't understand what happened."}
{"text":"Coudn't have been better!!!  The atmosphere, the food, the staff everything was excellent.  We enjoyed a private booth with a beautiful view and had a wonderful dinner.  Jose' was an amazing waiter and we Thank you for a very special evening!!  Paul F."}
{"text":"We took our team here during Yelp CM Regional Week and ohhhh my goodness, to say that we were blown away would be an understatement! First, the sunset views and private patios cannot be beat! Talk about romantic!   Now on to the food -- They serve yummy warm bread to start. Next, I split the caesar salad, filet, and scallops with a co-worker. The scallops were melt-in-your-mouth good. Holy yum, I could eat them every day! The steak was also amazing but the presentation left much to be desired. For sides, we split the crushed potatoes and kale. Oh my goodness, both were heavenly and the potatoes even had artichoke hearts in them!!! SOLD!   Although this is a pricey meal, I do think that it is worth it! Great views, great service, great food, what else could you want in a fine dining experience? I hinted at my fiance that this is a very romantic spot and would be great for a special occasion {especially because he loves sunets}. ;) I'm sure that we'll be back someday soon!"}
{"text":"We went for Arizona Restaurant Week after reading all the great reviews and thought, what a great way to celebrate our Anniversary! Finding the restaurant once in the Casino was kind of challenging but I am glad we did! Great Views and loved the live music! We checked in and had to wait for our table, we requested a window so we could see the sunset, we got a window, but it was on the other side of the restaurant so we couldn't even see the sunset... that was a bummer because the sky was bright orange that night! Regardless, the golf course was pretty and I was just happy to be out celebrating with Sean! Our first server came up and greeted us, he mentioned how his partner would be by in a moment to introduce himself. Mike took our order, I had the Seared Ahi (Failed to ask how I wanted that prepared) I just assumed it was be \"Seared\" and Sean had the Twin Torpedo Filets. We also ordered a few sides, the artichoke au gratin and the grilled portabella mushrooms. For our starter I had the Oysters, Sean tried the Lobster Bisque. Oysters were great, highly recommend them! Sean & I weren't crazy about the Bisque, I couldn't find any lobster & think the Bisque at Ruth's Chris is way better! Our Entrees came and looked great! Much to our surprise they came with sides already, that would have been nice to know when Mike took our order because it was a ALOT of food, James our other server seemed surprised when we mentioned we also had our sides. He said he would \"check\" on them... aka ring them in and hurry to get them out... without apologizing he brought them 15 minutes later. I was already confused by the two server situation but it seemed like a lack of communication between them because neither cared to admit their error. The Ahi was almost well done, and a small portion compared to Sean's steaks. I was extremely disappointed with my dinner, the sides were great (once we got them) and although cold, the filet's had a great sauce with them! We finished our meal with the banana gelato and a chocolate dome, great combination and both were tasty! I don't think I will be going back anytime soon, especially not for a celebration of some sort! A manager didn't even stop by to see how everything was, as everyone disappeared once they dropped off our food. Thanks, but No Thanks."}
{"text":"Our family went here to celebrate when my son became a Mesa firefighter.  We like to go there because at sunset the view is beautiful.  No problems with parking; used the garage.  Easy access to restaurant. We arrived early and got a few cocktails and appetizer in the bar, which was great. Our server was so attentive, no rushing, answered all questions.  Food met my expectation and loved the sweet potato side.My daughter did get a gritty scallop-- it happens. Unexpectedly brought my son a congratulations/thank-you dessert for being a first responder in the community. Loved the in-house cardomon caramels! Kids stayed to gamble after dinner.  It was a perfect evening."}
{"text":"I was severely disappointed with my experience at Orange Sky. I have heard amazing things about this restaurant and decided to check it out. Me and my date called to make reservations in a private booth for dinner but when we got there they had us waiting for 20 minutes and we went to the bar while we waited and never even got our drinks because the bartender was having an issue with something. So we finally get seated and it's a gorgeous set up and view but the service was so terrible. The servers were very rude and after they seated us at one table someone else came and had us move to a different table (closer to the dining room) which was much louder and less private. We ordered some drinks and it took over 15 minutes just to get them finally the manager come over and said everything was okay because apparently there was an issue with my drivers license being speculated. At this point we had been there over 45 minutes and hadn't even been served drinks. The sunset was almost practically over and we ended up leaving entirely because the whole experience was ruined. I am very disappointed with the way the staff was acting (rudely) and the service (non service) we received."}
{"text":"Located at the top of Talking Stick Resort and Casino, this restaurant is definitely worth a visit. Large spread out dining areas, special rooms, bar area and outdoor seating are all available. Amazing views are the big draw at Orange Sky. Service was exceptional with a well trained staff that is knowledgeable and friendly. The menu isn't the largest but there are ample choices to please land and seafood lovers alike. The wine list is fairly extensive and reasonably priced so we had a bottle of one of our favorites to accompany our superb meal. Desserts were also sampled and were right up to par with the rest of the meal. We have stayed at this resort several times and we have always found it to be very nice but never dined at Orange Sky. Now we have another great choice in restaurants too. We will return!"}
{"text":"Grew up going to restaurants where you had the 4 forks. Lol. Our experience, view, service was great! Mike was our waiter and he was more than knowledgeable about the menu. My wife had the salmon with a side of crushed potatoes and artichokes and I went for the gusto of Australian lamb chops and grilled kale. Nothing short of amazing! More than appeased my appetite! The drinks were strong and we waited for the sunset. Just a beautiful atmosphere and everyone was very friendly.  As I said before I grew up a lawyers son and forgot so many \"fine dining\" mannerisms. Lol it was a great reminder of the excellent life I grew up living and also reminded me that it's ok to do some nice things for yourself and family as well during your life. I recommend this place to the ones seeking to get away for the day."}
{"text":"Orange Sky is the signature fine dining restaurant at Talking Stick Resort.  People come here for special events and the sunset views and we came for the food.  OS has a great selection on wine and for starter, we ordered the braised beef cheek stuffed marrow bone and wild arugula and pickled apple salad.  They were interesting.  For main course, my hubby had the New York steak with red wine sauce and I had the halibut with their special feature, an creamy Asian style side dish with baby shiitakes.  The side dish was drowned in cream and I simply couldn't handle it.  My hubby enjoyed his meat!  We also had a dessert to share.  Overall, the food was just okay, with beautiful setting and topnotch service."}
{"text":"My inlaws love hitting the slots so as a result of having spent way too much time here and having lots of extra credits, I got a free meal and I couldn't have been more excited. I had been wanting to come here for a long time. We arrived early and sat at the bar and ordered a couple of cocktails. I got a glass of wine and my husband got a beer. The wine list is pretty impressive and not horribly priced. The had live music playing in the lounge which was really good. I was very surpised at the quality of the music. If I were braver I would have gotten up and danced.   Eventually we were lead back to back to the main dining room and I was floored by the view. Very nice! We were seated by the window facing west which I had read ahead of time was the place to be for the best view. The reviews were right, it was beautiful. If i were just here for drinks and the view I would definitely be giving this a five star review. Unfortunatelly the rest of the experience was less than impressive.   When our waitress came over we asked her what she recommended for appetizers, of course she recommended the $80 oyester and clam plate. Her next recommendation were the two next most expensive items on the menu paired together. Really? I hate it when you can tell a server is trying to up their payout. Maybe she really did like those items, but she could have at lease sold them better. Her attitude was very cold and felt like she had much better places to be than waiting on us. We did get one of her recommendations, the anitpasto platter. It was good but i've had better. No one at my table seemed to like it besides me. Since it was a Spanish themed tapas platter, I think the ingredients were a little to exotic for the small town midwesterners I was eating with.   We then ordered our dinner. I had the strip steak with the farro corn pesto salad. It was very good. Very well cooked and the flavors of the salad worked really well with each other. When I asked my dining companions if they enjoyed their meals, they all seemed to think their food was good, but i think when you see the caliber of the restaurant you just expect more. Something to wow you. We were never wowed.   I've seen other people mention this and they're right, if you're eating a 3 course meal expect about a 3 hour dining experience. I'm not saying this is bad, it's actually nice to sit amd just enjoy the views all night.   From what I saw there's only one bathroom for both men and women. For a fairly large restaurant, this is surprising.  having to wait for a restroom after spending so much on a meal seems ridiculous. While waiting for the women's to open I saw a man and women walk out of one together. Seeing that just summed up my entire dining experience.   This restaurant definitely sucks you in for the views which are great, but they definitely stop trying there. They know they'll keep people comimg for the views so no need to impress them with service and food."}
{"text":"Went there for our anniversary, so wanted a special occasion. We got it. The ambiance is wonderful. Tables are spaced out very nicely, contrary to most restaurants these days. Wonderful views. The service was very attentive without being hovering. And the food was quite good. Only complaint is too much dressing on the Caesar salad. Salmon and steaks were cooked just right. Veggie sides were excellent."}
{"text":"My twin moms friends were staying for the weekend at the resort, and since they didn't want to drive for dinner, they decided to dine at Orange Sky.  This review was going to be a 2 star, but after my horrible night, it definitely is a one.  It is not only that the prices are high, but the food is nothing special.  I like to eat and I couldn't find anything I really wanted.  I decided to order the beet salad, it was ok, but I had great ones in so many other places.  I should have stopped there and call it the night.  But since some of my girlfriends were ordering the Restaurant week menu, we had some more time to kill.  I asked to the Artichoke potato au gratin.  Big mistake.  It is really big size and I am glad I only ate half of it.  After that I felt I had a brick in my stomach.  I left my girlfriends around 10p.m. and I went home.  I couldn't sleep, I was so uncomfortable, and nauseous. Stop here if you don't want to be grossed out.  By 3:30 I couldn't take it and I was kneeling in front of my toilet.  It all came out undigested.  I was glad, but my throat was in pain.  Yuk! By the way I only had two glasses of wine."}
{"text":"Completely dissatisfied with this place and will not be returning! Went to a birthday party here where we paid in advance to partake of appetizers. $30 a head included am array of cheese cubes, a clump of blue cheese and some cooked veggies that were slimy and cold. The drinks were tiny pours in glasses with slanted bases to make it look like you are getting more than you are! To top it off the server decided to add her own gratuity of 22% and not tell us about it. There was just two of us on the bill. Our friend noticed his bill and the tip they added was higher than his entire bill! If you look out you may catch a nice view of the sunset but if you look down it's just brown dirt! Not good food, not good drinks, not good service! One star is generous!"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the fact that it's a casino restaurant. It was amazing!!  Could be romantic, though I was with a work group. The manager was completely accommodating, as was the wait staff. Everything was worth the price. I had the Caesar salad, a NY strip, and a side of crab. The steak was fantastic. The crab, however, was spectacular. They crack it all for you and bring you only the meat.  I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Giving one star because of the seating and service. We were told we couldn't have a seat with a view because we were there \"last minute\" on a weekend. Well we made a reservation earlier in the week and even added it was for our anniversary. We were seated about two feet away from the couple next to us. We could hear everything the they were saying and vice Versa. It was very awkward. We ended up leaving before the food arrived so can't comment on quality. I just didn't want to spend $150 for a long awkward dinner."}
{"text":"Food may be good, but the girls at front, one if them needs to take her nose out of the air and Learn about customer service.  Also, got there at 5, and absolutely no one in the restaurant for more than 45 min, \"do you have reservations?, No, do we need them,?  \"Well, we're booked until 9.\"  Right.  We saw that from our table in the bar.  No customers.  Feel better girls."}
{"text":"A beautiful, modern restaurant on the 15th floor of the casino. We thought our reservation was 15 min. earlier than it actually was and we were asked to wait until the 15 minutes was up. When we arrived at our table it was obvious that the restaurant could easily have accommodated us when we arrived. A little annoying, but just something you should know. Other than that the evening was wonderful. The food is superb and the service is wonderful. Our waitress, Ashley, was very informed about the menu and was very attentive. I had the salmon and my husband had the elk. Both were delicious. For an appetizer my husband had the foie gras, which was also wonderful. All in all a great experience. We will be back."}
{"text":"First time at Orange Sky tonight. It commands a spectacular view, hence the name. We had gone to Ocean Trails downstairs but the line/wait was way too long. There were 12 in line but it didn't really move for 15 mins.  We arrived here at 7:30 on a Saturday night but the restaurant was full, so we ate in the lounge.   I ordered the 3 bacon wrapped scallop and shrimp plate. My wife got the ribeye. We also added a plate of smashed potatoes and three drinks for $150.   Scallops were overcooked but it had a good flavor combo with the two proteins, which were both large. It came with a pea pur√©e plus a small fris√©e salad, so it was presented well.   The steak was excellent with the accompanying savory sauce on the side. The meat was cooked perfectly despite being 3/4\" thick. The ribeye flavor was well pronounced because they didn't over season it. Yay! The potato dish had pancetta and artichoke hearts for a well constructed side. The garlic and shaved asiago cheese set it off well.   The service was very good, despite eating dinner in a cocktail lounge. The table was rather small but we pulled it off.   I recommend Orange Sky for a romantic, fun evening."}
{"text":"Great view and atmosphere. Food is average at best.  Not steakhouse quality steaks and cooking and serving temperature needs to be hotter.   Limited menu."}
{"text":"This place is sooooooooooo amazing the views are to die for. I recommend going around sunset so breathtaking. The food the drinks the service was all great I definitely will be coming back again. Such a hidden gem   Best birthday dinner"}
{"text":"Spectacular from start to finish.  My husband and I booked a stay here to celebrate my coming home after 7 months away on a military assignment as a little 'stay-cation.' Upon arrival we're guided to our gorgeous executive king room with a spectacular view. After settling in we of course head downstairs for a bit of gaming (it is a casino resort after all). We were a little disappointed to find out the hard way that their on-floor drinking policy doesn't mirror that of Vegas where if you're playing you drink for free. We paid approximately $18 for two drinks while playing, nevertheless, the cocktails were well-made and delivered with a smile.   After losing several games we decided to head upstairs to Orange Sky restaurant. As we were a little early for our reservation they shepherded us to the bar where naturally we could add some much-needed lubrication to our wait. The wine list was excellent and we selected a bottle of 2013 BenMarco Malbec. We enjoyed the bottle for about 30 minutes and took it to our table which had become available. At the table we were greeted by our server Elyssa or Elissa (SP?). Before I continue, I must say that she is the reason I chose to write a review at all. Her service was impeccable! Not only was she well-educated on the offerings, but what would potentially suit our needs best. She was funny, but not obscene, accommodating but not intrusive, and professional without being stiff, curt, or dismissive. Too often have I gone to restaurants where the recommendations by the staff are simply the most expensive. Today was not the case. Her suggestions were all spot on and indicative of what she actually enjoyed the most and it was so refreshing to discover how much I enjoyed them myself.   We started off with replacing the bottle we had brought to the table with yet another of the same (why toy with perfection). I then selected the agave-chile beef tenderloin with sweet potato, avocado, pumpkin seeds to start and my husband the crab and corn fritters with i'itoi onion tartar sauce, and squash pickles. The tenderloin was absolute perfection. Few times before have I had such an exemplary protein. Cooked to perfection, melted in the mouth, and the sauce was fantastically rustic (as if rustic can have degrees which I argue it can). My husband enjoyed the crab cakes but did seem the slightest bit envious of my selection which is a rare occurrence to be sure.   For our entrees I chose the grilled elk loin with wild mushrooms, leeks, and a carrot-ancho sauce. He selected the twin 4-oz cuts of beef tenderloin with the added shrimp and scallop steaks option. He chose the yellow tomato horseradish cream which he enjoyed quite a lot and while mine came with the carrot-ancho sauce, I also asked for a side of the garlic-chile hollandaise. I was going to order the wild boar but was advised against it in favor of the elk which I'm thankful for considering the reviews on here of the boar and that they align with her conclusions. Too game-y, dry, and somewhat disappointing while the elk was anything but! Truly a delight, and he loved the beef! There was no part of the meal I didn't enjoy and just as we were ready for the bill, out came several complimentary desserts! A wonderful chocolate hazelnut ganache with a dark chocolate mousse quinelle and both chocolate and vanilla ice creams all because my husband had casually mentioned I was in the mood for some ice cream! This exemplifies service beyond what would ordinarily be called for or expected.   In summary, to dine here one cannot go wrong. Ask for Elissa, order nearly anything except the boar, and be prepared to be wowed! The cost was reasonable in relation to the experience and without question...we will return to enjoy the soon-to-be released winter menu!"}
{"text":"This place was really good. The service was great. I wish we had splurged and spent the extra money to get a private booth with a view for our early Vday dinner... I had a nice refreshing glass of moscato and my husband had kettle and sodas. He ordered the scallops and kale and I had the NY strip steak and crushed potatoes. It was all delicious. The potatoes had a little too much vinegar for me. What we didn't realize was that when we initially sat down and were offered water, was that we were charged for that water. We should have just said no water, or tap water. So instead of a 2nd glass of wine and dessert, I filled up on water... We also thought it was odd that they took our IDs for like 5 minutes. IDK maybe its an AZ thing?"}
{"text":"This is a beautiful restaurant and we were enamored by our experience here!  The staff was charming and attentive, the fare was high class and the drinks were mean!  Just what you would hope for on a date night! Since we pulled in at about 9pm without a Resi on a Thursday night we really weren't expecting much but we were so lucky to be off base. We were sat in the corner w a fantastic view and didn't feel rushed at all even though it was close to closing time.  We enjoyed the Oysters as a starter and then shared the 12oz Beef Filet which was seared perfectly and accompanied by a flight of sauces, since we couldn't choose which one we wanted the Server let us sample them all! The chimichurri, smoked tomato butter & Red Wine sauce were all equally delicious.  We added the Crushed Potatoes & Tuscan Kale as our sides and left impressed, fat and happy!  Kudos to Orange Sky!"}
{"text":"The ambiance was great and food great.. Unfortunately service not so great.. Ordered  one 17 oz ribeye and two filets.. Served three filet.. took one back but wrong one so my friend got a rare filet instead of med well..Ordered wine but had dregs . Alot of dregs in glass.. maybe they shouldnt pour last inch of bottle. Dessert described as mint chocolate mousse. It was chocolate mousse with a bottom layer of tasteless mint jelly.. should be described as layered chocolate mousse with mint leaf on bottom..So dessert was overall disappointing. The ribeye and one glass of wine taken off bill which was nice but I would rather have good service and pay. Finally, manager never came by which again would be more important than free food. I expect to pay but good service is just as important as good food.. Hostess was great and bartender also great"}
{"text":"A great place to celebrate that special occasion.  Great food and very good service.  The views are spectacular!"}
{"text":"Awesome view at tables alongside windows. The Elk dish was incredible. And the dark chocolate dessert with caramelized bananas was decadent!! Enjoy a peach Bellini while you're at it and then hit the casino on your way out."}
{"text":"If this isnot the most romantic restaurant in town please message me and tell me then.the view and ambience is so romantic .The food is even good.Dessert better ,drinks strong .Guys bring ur ladies here and all your sins will be erased.Side note my GF told me her hubby brought her here and they ended up conceiving baby  number 2!"}
{"text":"The restaurant name is as beautiful as the actual orange sky as you dine at sunset.  Came here for our anniversary dinner and enjoyed the experience.  It could possibly have been a 5 Star but I was sick and couldn't taste the food that well.  The starter bread was my least favorite item.  Not sure why it was a very dull and cold bread.  I usually fill up on bread before my entree comes but this time I hardly ate half a piece.  I ordered the elk since I've never had it before.  While it was tender and lean like our waiter described, it was too lean for my liking. I ended up drooling over and stealing part of my husband's delicious ribeye accompanied with CHIMICHURRI (my weakness). The sauce on the elk was also a sweeter sauce which is not my thing.  I would say a different person would have enjoyed it more but I should have stuck with the good old fatty ribeye.  The shareable sides were very good. We got the cooked kale and rosemary crushed potatoes.  We were ready to order dessert but then they brought out a complimentary anniversary dessert!  The dark chocolate mouse cake/tart was delectable though a bit small but not complaining!  I would like to come back and try on a day my tastebuds are in tip top shape."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for my birthday. We usually go to Mastro's or Durant's and I wanted to try something different. We arrived at 4:55 p.m. and noticed a crowd of people waiting. Apparently, they do not open the elevators to the restaurant until 5 p.m. Once we got to the restaurant we told the host, we have a 5 p.m. reservation. The host said she would get us when they were ready. So, what's the point in making a reservation? At 5:10 p.m. they seated us. The booth was a nice couch with pillows, curtains for privacy and a view. Unfortunately, we weren't able to see the sunset. But, we did have a good view of Top Golf. I had the Honey Poached Pear Salad, which was delicious. My boyfriend had the class Caesar Salad, which was just OK. He had the 12 ounce beef tenderloin. We thought it was tender and tasty. I had the 8 ounce Tajima Wagyu Striploin. I wish I had ordered something different. It was tough and lacked flavor. I've had Kobe beef before and it was delicious. This was terrible and even worse was the price of $60. Also, we both had the King Crab Merus (3 ounces), which was good but pricey. For the sides, we got the Cauliflower Aged Cheddar Gratin and it was bland. I couldn't taste any cheddar, it was just like watered down cauliflower. The Green Chile Whipped Potatoes were good. The server gave me a tiny slice of flourless chocolate cake for my birthday. It was so rich that we could only take one bite. For dessert, we ordered the cheesecake and cobbler with ice cream. I thought the dessert was good, but nothing like the desserts from Durant's! Overall, I'd say save your money and go somewhere else. The positives: server and private booth. The negatives: food wasn't worth the price and view wasn't great. If you're going to spend $250 (not including tip) on a meal and one cocktail, I think it should be one of the best meals of your life!"}
{"text":"Such a hidden gem...amazing views, beautiful dining room, great service and outstanding food!  We had a group of 8 people at Orange Sky tonight and had a great experience.  I started with the honey poached pear salad with cherries...exquisite, followed by the salmon entree with the faro, corn, cauliflower and potato sides and we finished up with the chocolate tart with peanut butter (my favorite), coconut lime panna cotta, pistachio cake and chocolate mousse cake - so tasty!"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere.  I love the view.  I love the modern decor.  I love the openness of the place.  I could probably spend all day and night here in one of their comfy chairs drinking martinis.  However, when it comes to the food and service my 'love' of this place is downgraded to 'eh.  I went here with my wife and a few friends before seeing a comedy show (Jim Gaffigan) downstairs.  We had a reservation which really wasn't needed because the place was pretty dead.  We were seated promptly and our waitress was pleasant.  We had about 2 hours before our show was to start which we figured would be plenty of time for a cocktail and dinner.  For being so dead this place was somehow very slow with just about everything except with our entrees which came out before we were done with our salads/appetizers.  The waitress awkwardly turned around to put our steaks back in the kitchen for 5 more minutes which ultimately screwed them up.    Here is my rundown on the food:  * Bread = nothing special but comes in handy because you will wait forever for your food.  * Roman Caesar Salad = worst Caesar type salad I've ever had.  It had hardly any flavor due to not enough dressing, sub-par quality lettuce, and an overall weird mix of ingredients.  * Burrata and Prosciutto Pesto = not bad but somebody took it away without asking if we were through with it yet.  * Kobe Flat Iron Steak = very good and very flavorful  * Ribeye = just ok for a $40 steak.  Nowhere near the flavor or quality of some other high-end steak places in the area.  * Garlic Steak Fries = wtf?  They are HUGE (think a potato cut into 4 pieces) and lacked any kind of garlic flavor.  Needed ketchup or aioli badly.  * Brussels Sprouts = excellent!  * Garlic Herb Butter \"Sauce\" = wasn't a sauce at all.  It was clearly hard butter.  I think they forgot to microwave it.  This place is definitely worth a visit to sit, sight see, and have a drink.  If its top notch service and steak you are looking for try Dominick's or Mastro's.  I'm glad I went here but I won't be back for dinner."}
{"text":"2nd time here. First time was amazing which is why we came back again. Unfortunately, this time it seemed we kept getting forgotten about most of the evening....not great when your spending $300 on dinner for 3 people."}
{"text":"Great food, and fairly unique menu offerings with protein choices like Elk & Buffalo. The view from atop Talking Stick resort is cool, nice place to bring an out of town guest. Definitely recommend getting the pumpkin see crusted prawns as the appetizer, and for sides the quinoa and mushrooms were really nice. Prices are as expected for the ambiance and location. It if you're looking for an enjoyable night out ordering from the left side definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Well we weren't sure what to expect from an Indian casino restaurant, but from the moment you get there you can't help but be impressed. They sat us outside where i had asked to be seated when i had made mt reservation, and then Julio arrived at the table. We immediately knew that our evening would be enjoyable. My brother, who was visiting from out of town, asked Julio about almost every item on the menu, and Julio was perfect at explaining all the items. As for the food...it was delicious! The rib eye and sirloin were cooked and seasoned perfectly, As was the swordfish. The accompaniment's we ordered, Brentwood corn and sweet potatoes with goat cheese were amazing! All the waiters that we had at the table were great, but hats off to Julio for making the evening that much more special.  We'll be visiting again for sure, but maybe next time I'll reserve a private dining booth for me and my girlfriend. Either way inside or outside you can't loose."}
{"text":"SKY IS THE LIMIT!:)  The views are amazing. I recommend calling to confirm a booth or table along the windows to make sure you sit where you want. The food was good but it is expensive."}
{"text":"ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL RESTAURANTS EVER Place is beautiful. Breathtaking. Make sure to check out the outside area with a pool and heating lamps. We came here for a team dinner and everyone was floored by the great mountain views  Stumbled upon this gem as I looked at close-by places. \"Hmm, it's on the top of a casino on a road called Talking Stick Way, let's check it out..\"  LAMB CHOPS Literally floored at the masterful lamb chops I had. The best I've ever had  A friend of mine got WAGYU and the piece I had was literally melt in your mouth umami fat protein ughhhh  Mac n cheese was great and even the kale was tasty!!!  POST- FOOD HIGH- i think they pump oxygen in here because we were all euphoric (i kid you not) after our meal  Phenomenal dining experience. Our waiter was amazing and super attentive. Orange Sky is a MUST if you're even within 50 miles. Seriously. I can't wait to take my future wife here."}
{"text":"Review is for the atmosphere and bar. Dinner on our next visit. We arrived just in time for sunset and of course it was too cloudy to see a nice sunset. But, we retired to the bar and were served perfect martinis by the friendly and engaging bartenders. Great vibe here as the bartenders and patrons are very friendly and we had wonderful conversations with all. We did order their cheese plate as an App and it was out of the ordinary in a good way.  Creamy blue cheese and a hard bold cheese were my favorites."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great! The Wait staff was very attentive. Everything was great...until my boyfriend and I both got rip roaring belly aches-with subsequent (and multiple )trips to the bathroom between us.....we decided it was the large sea food tray that did us in..."}
{"text":"Great ambiance.  Good views.  Food was amazing.  I recommend the filet.   Service is exemplary."}
{"text":"I was tricked to go here by my brother because he wanted to get us to the casino! I was happily surprised by how much I enjoyed everything. Appetizers, steaks, sides and desserts were all good. Service and atmosphere great. I know you get what you pay for but it was way too expensive for me. It came out to about $100 per person and we didn't even drink alcohol. Great for a vacation visit."}
{"text":"This was our 4th or 5th time eating at Orange Sky at Talking Stick Resort and as usual we had a fantastic dinner. I love the scallops and the view. Our server was Amy and she enhanced our meal with great sense of humor!"}
{"text":"This place was incredible! The absolute best steak I've ever had and a very up scale experience. Highly recommend for a date night."}
{"text":"Although I had originally planned this as a business meeting for three; instead of cancelling the reservation, I opted to keep it and convert it to a nice intimate dinner for my wife and I.  As we traversed the long corridor towards the main dining room; my wife commented on the west facing booths for couples, asking why we didn't get those tables?  I summarily and promptly quipped that I had originally meant this reservation for our foreign business guests, and I didn't think it was appropriate that we share such an intimate setting.  She chuckled as we proceeded along, and was immediately impressed by the panoramic view presented to us as we entered the main dining room.  We were promptly seated; and Faye, our server, cheerfully greeted us. She went through the customary introductions, and proceeded to take our drink orders. Kyle, her support wait staff, promptly filled our water glasses.  We ordered the Nosh Board, which is a combination of aged fondue, cured meats, and pickles. They were absolutely fabulous, and the inclusion of the Marcona Almonds just added another dimension to this delectable shared plate.  I was quite famished; therefore, I opted for the 17 ounce Rib-Eye Steak. My wife ordered the New York strip. For our shared sides, we ordered the Asparagus (I love asparagus!), and the Smashed Potatoes.  My steak was quite tender and juicy, and the remaining portion after cooking was quite prodigious. The flavor didn't quite permeate all the way; probably because of the way that it was prepared, but it was quite delectable, nonetheless.  My wife's steak wasn't quite as juicy as mine, and certainly much smaller, but none of this detracted from its overall superb flavor.  Overall, the presentation, care and preparation of our food was definitely superlative. Faye, and her support wait staff were absolutely on point in every aspect - fleetly anticipating our needs as we progressed through the evening's meal.  And what about the view that everyone comments about?   Well, it's always quite challenging to articulate the experience that accompanies a personal visual perspective. All I can say is that you need to experience it yourself; especially during a beautiful sunset because it definitely is quite splendid."}
{"text":"Went for appetizers and drinks, sat at the bar, I had the craft beers and my lovely date had the cocktails.  Good service in a great setting.  The patio is awesome and romantic with the best views in a Maricopa county restaurant.  Be prepared to overpay for everything in the orange sky buy it makes for fun night.  Go downstairs and party in the lounge bar next to the casino and have some fun with some casino characters, a funky mix of young and old, locals, and tourists."}
{"text":"This place has an excellent view but it a little overrated. The martinis were overpriced and I  felt like I was in Vegas with these prices.  Nice part was the live music and dancing - great experience - you can't have it all."}
{"text":"We celebrated my husbands 50th birthday at Orange Sky this past weekend.  We were impressed, our guests were impressed and the party was a huge success!  We pre-ordered our wine and hor d'oeuvres and had a private server.  The restaurant allowed us to decorate our area in advance and we even had a small private balcony.  The bar and dance floor were just steps away and the band was a lot of fun.  Between eating perfectly spiced crab cakes and tuna tartar we packed the dance floor.   We have enjoyed dinner here in the past but this was the first event we experienced here.  I can tell you it won't be the last.  Thank you to our wonderful server, the Chef, the Bartender and Cameo (our planner.)  Your attention to detail and our satisfaction was evident."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE service, I want to give it a ZERO- I was carded and had to have my ID taken away and scanned. I am 33, and was the only African American in the restaurant. Bad servers who are not knowledgeable of the food they serve, and don't ask about allergies. Michelle is the WORST, rude - and short with responses. Overpriced for a fatty piece of lamb"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place so much, it's such a cool restaurant and the views are amazing. I honestly expected better service due to their reputation. We were promptly greeted and sat, which was great. Once our waitress greeted us we were oh so foolish to order a drink, my wife and I were carded. Although, I'm not sure how many underage kids are trying to order $20 cocktails from a fine dining establishment.   The waitress took the id's for the greater part of 20 minutes and came back to inform us my wife's id had just expired. Instead of asking for another form of id she disappeared until I had the audacity to ask the manager if there was a problem. The manager proceeded to blame that policy on the Indian reservation and casino policy. My wife is 33 years old, she would've gladly produced a current id if that was requested. Instead they decided to have my wife work with her expired id and sign a waiver. This was a bit embarrassing and to me is unacceptable for a place that is going to charge essentially $100 a head. All of this followed by bringing me out the wrong drink.   My wife did love her scallops, my steak was maybe a little over cooked but it tasted alright."}
{"text":"We went for the view and stayed for good service and food. The view is amazing. We had option to sit on the patio, beautiful weather, breathtaking view and delicious food.   We had the cheese platter and the selection was good. 7 different cheeses with honey and other taste enhancers. We ordered the pork shank and vegetarian options put together.   Enjoy service by Kyle and over all experience"}
{"text":"Came in from Michigan for our anniversary and chose Orange Sky for Anniversary dinner. Upon entering, had to sit and wait to be taken back (I made our reservation 1 month in advance). Upon entering we noticed that the majority of the restaurant was empty. Despite making my reservation a month in advance at \"sunset hour\", we were taken to the direct opposite side of the restaurant next to the servers stand with a view of the kitchen. Oysters were nothing short of basic (we can get better back home), beef tenderloin appetizer was just ok, a bit spicy if that would bother you. We ordered the scallops in wrapped jalape√±o bacon which was extremely spicy and the swordfish that came out dry as a brick. Another server who wasn't our server or a manager asked how our meals were and we told him about the swordfish at which point he agreed that it looked horrible and suggested the salmon. Ok fine. 20 minutes later the salmon comes out and it is over cooked. We had a squash side that was the best part of our meal. Then another came out as perhaps they were trying to compensate? No one told us why tho. They also brought me another drink after I told them I didn't want another one. The service was nothing short of being ignored. Our waiter had 3 other tables of groups of 10 or more! We were waited in by 3 different people. A guy we had never seen before asked us if we wanted dessert from the servers desk! Are you kidding me? This was not first class anything. We had better meals the entire remainder of our stay in the Scottsdale/Paradise Valley area. After 3 hours of this circus, the Manager came over, apologized and told us our food would be comped. The bill showed up with the drink I didn't order on it. We asked for that to be removed, paid for our other drinks and left. And we had to chase the waiter down to pay so we could leave! Upon leaving I actually wondered if we would have had a better meal at the buffet."}
{"text":"I recently ate here for the first time although I have been to the lounge and happy hour (although they don't actually have happy hour) several times.  It was a welcome to AZ dinner for my parents so I called ahead and ask for a nice table I was booked into a private booth looking out over the valley.  Amazing views and was very nice.  Although after exploring the rest of the restaurant a normal table in the main dinning room by the window would have been just as special for a family dinner.  If you are looking for a special occasion restaurant for you and someone special the private booths would make a really special experience (~$150 min FYI).  I would highly recommend for anniversary dinners etc.    Service is what you would expect for a restaurant of this level, several people worked the table and were very professional.  One thing I would say negative was I asked for a recommendation between two wines, the server preceded to ask me my price range and then recommended a wine $40 more then the range and then could not even find it on the menu.  Made for an awkward situation but other then that service was great.    Food was really good, although they are known for their steaks we all ended up getting seafood which was all very good.  Salmon was some of the best I have had.  The Crushed potatoes and Carrots were the sides we ordered and they were both good.  The desert was amazing it was some chocolate and berry creation don't remember the name.    All and all it was a great experience and I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great views awesome food top notch service!  Food was amazing.  Server was on top of her game.   Could not ask for a better night out !!!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times, and while this won't be a especially lengthy review, I wanted to point a few things out: 1. The service! It is simply impeccable. When I dine at a finer establishment, it irks me when the wait staff is \"in my way\". Ex: they constantly check up on our table, interrupt the tables' conversation. The staff here are experts at being invisible. Props! (Please don't think I am a jerk, but a great waiter/waitress is a skill and a talent. Let's face it, we're there for the experience with the guests we bring) Not to mention, tables get 2-3 wait staff at a time, so everything comes out at the same time. They are also so polished, and smooth. The wait staff must be mind readers; only coming when they pick up on the electrical impulses from when you just begin thinking you need something, before you can say it.  Sorry to drone on, but this kind of thing I really notice.  2. The steak is really, really well prepared. Now, some people may balk on more well-known places, but the preparation in conjunction with the sides make it my favorite place to get a NY strip.  3. To sum everything up, I've not had a bad experience here. The staff, food, service...heck the men's restroom, is flawless.  I'll update the review when I go back!"}
{"text":"We've gone here for many of our relationship milestones. I wish we hadn't."}
{"text":"Great food prepared well romantic atmosphere ....service is wonderful....a good choice"}
{"text":"Beautiful setting, excellent food and service. Consistent in all regards. We've held family celebrations, car club events and just dinner with friends at Orange Sky and it is a long standing favorite."}
{"text":"This restaurant was beautiful to look at but the food was low quality.  I ordered a steak and I've had better steaks served at Dennys.   It was not salted and the texture was strange.  The menu is alacart so the sides were not included.  I ordered smashed potatoes that came whole not smashed,  again zero flavor...not salted  and they were dry and bland.   I would NEVER eat here a again. ...the chef in the kitchen should be fired immediately! !  Only go for a drink and leave to get food,  not worth it."}
{"text":"I took my husband for his birthday and it was a great experience.  We had steak. It was wonderful and Big! I had the rib eye and my husband had the 12 oz filet. Both were very very good....and we are very picky about our steak. We also had the cauliflour for a side, big enough for us both and was very good too. The service was also amazing. They brought my husband a special desert for his birthday. It was just perfect and very good. Our waitress was so very nice and professional. We will be back."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our 11 year anniversary dinner.  However I wish we could have gotten the private (high back) seating so we could have gotten the sunset view directly.  We walked by the high back seating and noticed some of them were empty the whole time we were there.  The food was delicious!  We ordered and shared the Small Beef Tenderloin and Chilean Sea Bass.  The Tenderloin was cooked perfectly and the Sea Bass melted in your mouth like butter, both perfectly seasoned and absolutely delicious!  We also each had a scallop and steak, but it was too salty and perhaps too much food by the time we ate the steak and fish with a side dish of crushed potatoes (recommend this one too!).  Our server did a fantastic job separating our dishes into two for us and she gave us a very yummy chocolate cookie dessert that was beautifully displayed!  Our view from our table was disappointing, although we were looking directly at the fireplace, the 5 Neon Exit signs were very distracting and took away from the romance.  But we walked outside, enjoyed the view and very impressed with the heaters.  We're planning on taking his parents here when they come into town in March.  We'll make sure we can get the window seating to watch the sunset!"}
{"text":"We spent our wedding anniversary here and is our second visit.  The food is excellent! Great steak!  Our waiter Michael is very professional and an expert in his craft.  We were very satisfied with the service and guidance he provided.  I will highly recommend this place to our friends.  My wife and I appreciate the Anniversary treat. We will come back again."}
{"text":"I have to teeter between three and four stars on this one and tell you the short story is that the atmosphere is among the BEST so food almost doesn't matter. The decor is modern, beautiful and whimsical. The Food I tried was somewhat Basic and really was OK but was unlike the decor. (maybe I just wanted it to be a little fancier to wow me)  I thought the Kitchen not the servers seemed a bit out of sync to me on our visit here so  that helped influenced me to go with three stars.   This is a special destination place and is good for groups but  if you desire a private room for your group they must spend at least two thousand dollars. You also need to be aware That a three course dinner with a group of people takes about three hours.  I will say I don't agree with most of the reviewers saying the pricing is too high for what they got. I don't recall all the pricing but from what I remember  $24. for Jidori Chicken, $39. for Kolbe style hanger steak, $30 for Sea bass and $8 for ample sides are really what most places would charge.  I will say I didn't care about the parking because it was 118 degrees, I was all dressed up and didn't feel like walking threw the hot parking lot and we felt like valeting it but the valet was closed to people not staying over night in the casino.   While waiting for the group I was joining I decided to try a Negroni ($15.) Cocktail. It was made with all name brand stuff and was a double size. So I think it was a very fair price for a special old school cocktail that is one of Anthony Bourdain's last meal list. It's a very unique taste of bitter, sweet  but not too sweet and boldly strong in a good way and seemed kind of refreshing. They had live entertainment in the lounge and some people were dancing.   It was very dark in the restaurant and so you had to use your phone as a light to read the menu. Our group takes a very long time to decide so I do an Anthony Bourdain and decide to have another cocktail. I don't know how long it took but we arrived at 7 and I looked at my phone and saw it was 8:38 and we still didn't have appetizers yet. I was thinking that they'd come out with dinner but they didn't (Phew) and did arrive after some amount of time.   When my halibut arrived I found out it was dry and over cooked but the majority of meals that were served to our table were fine. The waiter asks me how it was and I was honest and said the halibut was very dry and over cooked but still edible and I didn't feel like sending it back. The waiter talked me out of feeling that way and said he'd have a new one for me shortly....and he DID! The new one was cooked just right so it was good. Nothing wrong with it just good sitting on some dried chili pineapple sauce. I did find out latter that the other person at my table with halibut also had dry halibut but didn't tell the waiter.   Over all I was happy and now know I also like Negroni Cocktails. Those cocktails are almost even healthy as the bitters in the drink are good for your liver and help contradict the gin.  The halibut was good but wasn't up there with a few others I had this year so that's why it's three star to me. I know everyone was happy and we would go back again."}
{"text":"The Orange Sky is located on the 15th floor of the Talking Stick resort.  It offers an excellent panorma view.  When making reservation they ask if you are celebrating a special occasion, indeed, it was my boyfriend's birthday!   Made reservations at 5:30 and from the moment we were seated, we were warmly greeted and had excellent customer service.  Seated in a plush dining room with crisp white linens in a semi private booth.  I felt as if I was in my own little world.  Private and yet views of the valley and the entire dining room.  Our timing couldn't be better with the sunset views, once the sun went down, the lighting changed and it felt cozy and VERY romantic.    The antipasti plate is so delicious with the roasted squash hummus and the bacon wrapped dates.  Great to share for two and definately recommend to try.  I also ordered the Rib Eye Steak, it was solid, nothing remarkable but it was good.    The pianist gives a super loungey feel, 5 stars for him alone.  You'll definatley leave with good vibes and and would definatley return. Classy and sophisticated.  Oh btw, if you're up for some dancing, after the restaurant closes, the lounge area before entering the dining room, turns into a dance floor at about 10:30pm (no cover).  Nothing over the top or too crowded but it was a great place to get your groove on afterward.  I was not expecting that at all.  It was a great night overall."}
{"text":"The feeling of luxury and exceptional service start upon entering the private elevator to the top of the talking sticks casino and continues till your departure. The food is four diamond rated and rightfully deserving. Highly recommend the small plate, which features scallops served on their original shells, to start with. Some other highlights feature the rib eye and sea bass which are beyond reasonably priced for their quality. Our server, Julio, was amazing and was there attentively throughout the night with helpful suggestions and whitty banter. He even went above and beyond when it came to dealing with a very particular/demanding customer such as my father. Oh and did I mention the view is FANTASTIC!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed New Years Eve at Orange Sky and our server Michelle was the absolute best. Food and drinks were delicious as always. The view is beautiful! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"It's very rare that Yelp does me wrong but it happened tonight.   To start, host was inattentive and disorganized which seemed odd once we sat at one of the few tables taken.   One of the reasons for selecting this restaurant was for the romance. Not tonight. Why the host sat us near a large ignorantly loud party I have no idea.   Onto the food. Shrimp cocktail on a block of salt. If the shrimp was fresh it may have been ok. Four large shrimp, one of which was mushy and bad. We told the waitress and she brought one back on a small plate. Main taste was salt.  I had a tasteless filet that they claim was 12 ounce. I figure it to have been closer to 8. It was tender but had little to no taste.   My wife had sea bass.  Flat and fishy, again, not very fresh.   We had no drinks, no sides and the bill for the poor service and food was over $100.    We found it odd that no waiter, waitress or host asked us how our meal was, they really didn't seem to care.  Scottsdale has some great restaurants but this isn't one of them, I wouldn't even use the word good."}
{"text":"Great views, service and food. Went for the elk loin but they ran out.  After wiping my tears away I had the veal chop and it was outstanding!"}
{"text":"They called the day before to confirm our reservation, at the end of the call she said, \"you are aware of the $125 minimum, right?\"  Very crass. Dinner took forever and when it arrived the server said it was probably because of the pork chop and she was right.  It was so over cooked I couldn't even swallow it.  After dinner we went to the lounge and ordered a very nice bottle of champagne and the server asked us if we were serious. The staff needs more training, menu was not impressive."}
{"text":"Overall, we had a great experience.  I wasn't super hungry, so I opted for a salad and an appetizer.  The four stars is for the service and the view!  Next time, I will be sure to bring my appetite and reserve a private booth to take it all in!  Boyfriend had the salmon... cooked perfectly and plated beautifully on a cedar plank.  Very pricey, but worth it for a fancy night out. Strict dress code, no flip flops or shorts!"}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant. Food was amazing and our server was great and attentive. We had a mosh board which was so good. I recommend anyone to try it. We also ordered the New York strip and the swordfish and it was cooked to perfection. The crushed potatoes were really good as well. And finally our waiter learned it was our anniversary and gave us a free dessert. Such a great place. We had a wonderful experience and will be back again."}
{"text":"I really want to keep this review simple, If you like AMAZING food, and dont mind spending the money for a true dining experience... then reserve a private booth and enjoy."}
{"text":"My mom was in town and we celebrated my belated birthday. Wow- the whole experience was out of this world amazing!! Our server was impressive- he was professional and accomodating. The view was breathtaking and the food was beyond delicious. I highly recommend dining here! I myself cannot wait to come back."}
{"text":"Excellent choice.  We tried it after many recommendations from neighbors and they were right.  Great service, delicious food, beautiful views, absolutely no complaints.  Worth every penny."}
{"text":"The sky is actually orange. Hence, the name. The food is amazing and beautifully presented on white plates. FYI: they won't seat you until your entire party shows up for your reservation. So make sure that you tell people to show up on time. Courtesy is on the utmost. Eat lots of bread because they bring everybody's food out at the same time. And by then you are starving. And unhappy! Grumpy and hungry. But with every growl in my stomach, it was worth the view of the valley. The drinks are yummy and the service is superb. The price is on the high-end side. Check your wallet before you go."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  I took my son to Arizona to visit relatives in July.  Since we were also there celebrating we stayed at Talking Stick resort and went to Orange Sky.  Both are bit pricey, but you get what you pay for.    Atmosphere: This place is really built for romance!  Make reservations for a bench booth to watch the sunset!  Four or five months out of the year the outdoor seating would be very nice.  In July not so nice.  LOL.  It was 100+ degrees at sunset when we were there.  Service:  It was awesome.  Cannot say enough about the wait staff! There recommendations spot on!  They over heard us talking about his graduating from the sixth grade and brought him a desert consisting of mousse, cheesecake, and more.  Oh yeah... Congratulations spelled out in a chocolate sauce and a lit candle.  Thanks guys!!  Food:   My son and I decided to try something we have never had and something we knew we would like so we could share the two plates.  I ordered the halibut and he ordered the elk.   The elk was new for us... and so good that my son didn't really want to share.  I did get to taste it and I agree with him, the elk was that good.  I wouldn't want to share either.   I was probably okay with it because I had the best halibut I have ever had.  I really didn't want to share the halibut either.  We both loved the food!"}
{"text":"Yes we also went for a Birthday celebration... Great food and views our waiter was wonderful but the Hostess, Bar/Lounge Service and Manager were rude and untrained and  terrible. Took 20 minutes to get a drink in the lounge prior to going to our table and the drinks were not what we ordered. They had an attitude- very rude-The Restaurant was empty and we were told we had to go to our Table because they weren't going to hold our table any longer.... there was no one in the restaurant. The Hostess went to the Manager and she came back and said yes you can stay for a few more minutes.. Really.. When it took 20 min. to get a drink- that was the wrong drinks... The Cocktail waitress was very busy talking to the bartender and we sat there waiting... We were definitely an inconvenience... In 5 minutes the Hostess came back to get us and take us to our Table.... The Wine had turned- the bottle was bad and we had to order a second that was more expensive... Our Bill for two was almost 300.00 and to be treated like we were an inconvenience is just not work the great view... They say they have a dress code but when we were leaving a group  came in and were seated with frayed jeans and cut offs and  tee shirts. Not dressed appropriately.. I know it was a Monday night but still...The locals are talking and it's a shame we wish we could have a fine dining restaurant that is consistent with fine dining service......."}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant!  My husband and I dined here for our anniversary.  Upon arrival, you'll be whisked to the top of the resort in a private elevator which opens to a lovely lounge.  The piano player is definitely a nice touch.  There your hostess will greet you.  Yes, greet you.  No employees huddled in private conversation.  My husband requested a private booth for sunset.  Once I relocated half a dozen pillows in the booth, I settled in to the table overlooking a wall of drawn shades.  There were a couple side chairs in the corner as well.  I'm assuming this is so your dining partner has somewhere to sit in the event you overdo it and need to lie down in the booth between courses.  At the magic hour, the blinds were raised and there was a wall of floor-to-ceiling windows with lovely mountain views and a setting sun.  Very romantic, but let's get to the food.  We started with a small iced shellfish platter with king crab legs, oysters, mussels and shrimp.  The crab legs were already cracked which I appreciate greatly.  For my entree, the mediterranean sea bass with leeks and mushrooms in a white wine sauce.  Perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned, perfectly eaten.  For sides we shared the fried green tomatoes and the cauliflower gratin.  The gratin was sinfully rich and creamy.  The tomatoes were nicely fried, but not quite tender enough.  We were given a complimentary dessert as well.  Service was impeccable from start to finish.  I felt the pricing was more than reasonable for a restaurant such as this.  Our meal was somewhere around $250, excluding tip, but that also included flowers for me (which were beautifully done!) and a bottle of wine.  They do have a dress code that while enforced, it's not terribly strict..mostly no t-shirts, ripped up jeans, flip-flops, etc.  Nothing that would kill any of us to abide, even in the middle of July.  Note to husband...would love to go again!!"}
{"text":"The service is impeccable here. I still love coming here for special occasions because the night is so relaxing and I know the food will be executed flawlessly. That's why I was excited to start the new year's day 2013 with my family.   I stepped out of my routine of ordering a Malbec or temperanillo with my meal, and ventured to ordering an Old Fashioned. They do it well here! I'm almost thinking about making the picture I took of it my phone wallpaper because I always want to remember it!   My family ordered oysters to start as always. One of the oysters I chomped into contained a special surprise... A pearl! Don't worry, I didn't break a tooth or anything, but it definitely surprised me when I was chewing and thought, \"Wow, this is a huge piece of grit in my oyster,\" and was shocked to find a small pearl! I guess that doesn't always happen, but I will look for another when I eat oysters so I can make earrings or something!  My twin beef tournedos (mini twin filets) was just as amazing as always paired with the Bernaise sauce. I actually split it this time with my friend so we could try their special for the night... A chilean sea bass sitting on lobster cakes topped with an Asian glaze type sauce. Usually I love sushi, so cooked fish seldom impresses me, but this sea bass was incredible, especialyl mixed with lobster cakes. Who wants crab cakes, when you can have awesome lobster cakes, right??"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to have a little staycation for our anniversary and made a reservation up at Orange Sky. The place is phenomenal! Take your breath away stunning. The views. You have about 270 degrees of spectacular Arizona landscape. Add to that, the best service ever (thank you Bradford!!) and the most exquisite food and you have yourself a total experience. We shared the beef tenderloin for two, added the scallops with shrimp and wrapped in jalape√±o bacon, mushroom ragout, and served with green chili mashed potatoes and asparagus with crispy pancetta. To die for! It is definitely spendy but worth every penny. This will be our go-to place for special occasions."}
{"text":"Terrible, Terrible service! No coordination between the lounge and the restaurant. Our party had a 45 minute wait in the lounge because it was a Friday night. We ordered drinks and appetizers. Our waitress was FANTASTIC. As our waitress went to get our appetizers, the hostess came to get us for our table in the restaurant. When we asked whether we needed to close our tab out at the lounge, the hostess told us, \"No worries, we'll transfer it to your table\" Nope, our lounge waitress came over in a huff to close out our tab.   We sat down at our table at 8:10PM. It was obvious that our server and the lounge waitress were arguing about our lounge tab. The restaurant really wasn't that busy. It was 8:50PM, and our server had not bothered to come take our order. The only time he hustled over was when he saw us get up to leave - WITHOUT ORDERING BECAUSE HE DIDN'T BOTHER TO COME TAKE THE ORDER.   The menu is \"meh\". Limited steak and seafood menu. Meat 'n potatoes. I expect better service for the prices they were charging."}
{"text":"I took my fianc√© here for his birthday.  The food and ambiance was incredible, but I have to say the best part about our night was our server, Will!  He recommended the Elk, which I would have never ordered on my own and it was amazing!  I would have given the restaurant a 4 star rating but because of Will's excellent service I decided Orange Sky deserved a 5!  Thank you, Will! :)"}
{"text":"I'm giving Orange Sky a solid four stars for a great experience. It's not my favorite restaurant in town, but it definitely one that impressed me beyond belief!   I visited Orange Sky months back when Talking Stick first opened and explored the restaurant sans guests, so I knew what I was walking into. However, I must say that it was even better the second time I went!   Time was running out to participate in Restaurant Week so we looked at the list of restaurants and decided that this was the perfect chance to try Orange Sky. Luckily we made reservations because when we arrived, they said that it was full until 9 PM (this was at 7). Upon arrival at the hostess stand at the bottom floor, I noticed that they have a really strict dress code: no t-shirts, cut-offs, flip flops, shorts, and some others that I can't remember. Once they checked our reservation, we got into the elevator and I was pleasantly surprised to see that one of the walls is glass, allowing us to look out on the desert as we zipped up. We arrived on the 15th floor and walked out into a lively lounge equipped with patios, plenty of seating and even a pianist singing classic tunes.   The restaurant itself is intimate and very much like a restaurant you would find in a large city. Glass windows line the restaurant and they have plenty of private seating. They have rooms to the right that seat roughly 15-20 people, including a wine rack room. To the left, they have private niches that seat between 4-6 people with windows looking out on the skyline. The main section of the restaurant has plenty of booths and tables as well as other tables along the windows. Then the rooftop patio has couch seating as well as regular tables. They even offer light-up menus since it's dark. The patio would be a wonderful place to sit and grab drinks and food and they even have a staircase that goes directly down into the club on the 14th floor.   Moving on to the food, it was pretty good. I started with the Artichoke bisque, followed by the game hen and ended the meal with a chocolate tarte. Everything was tasty. A couple things I noticed that stood out was when I asked our waitress what appetizer she suggested off of the prix fix menu, she said she didn't like one and hadn't tried the other and really did a pretty poor job of selling any of the items. I opted for the bisque without high expectations and it was a lot better then she sold it to be! Then for the wine, another waiter came by and asked us if we wanted refills on our cocktails. My bf opted for another beer and said so but I still had a half of glass of wine so didn't order another one. The second beer shows up and the next thing I know the waiter is pouring wine into my glass. I stopped him and said I didn't order a glass of wine and he said he thought he heard me say I did. I said I hadn't and at this point it was too late because the wine was already poured in. However, the waiter was very nice and since I hadn't asked for the wine, they didn't end up charging us for it.   In summary, I like Orange Sky and this is definitely a great option for date night, if you have visitors in town, or if you are staying at the casino. It's worth it to go for the ambiance alone."}
{"text":"Slow service at bar and table. Servers/bartenders were kind and courteous but not a real sense of urgency. Great food and ambience. A little over priced."}
{"text":"This restaurant had the most beautiful view! We left our ordering up to the server and had the most incredible steak and bacon wrapped scallops!!! Our server Myron was quick and kind even though it was Valentines Day. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic. From the wonderful views, fantastic service and the great meal, it could not have been any better. I highly recommend this restaurant! We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"i gave it 5 stars for the excellent service. when we were trying our wine, i stated to my wife, \"oh, you taste it...your the birthday girl\". our server obviously took note because at the end of the meal, he brought out a delightfully tasty desert, replete with a chocolate Happy Birthday message.  the food was good, but as mentioned in some of the other reviews, i expected better technique in the food prep. she ordered the tuna and i the scallops are both dishes were over-cooked...still good, but overcooked. the beet salad (red and white beets) app was delicious, as was our a la carte items, the asparagus (thick, but not chewy and stringy, perfectly al dente) and the mushroom risotto (very earthy taste....excellent!).  we missed the sunset by about 20 minutes but still had a nice view of the city lights. just an fyi....when making reservations, ask for one of the big booths facing west. i didn't know about those so we missed out, but next time....  like i said, our service was impeccable, friendly, and very attentive. don't come in a hurry. it's not slow, but it's not fast food. be prepared to spend some time conversing with your dinner partner and enjoying each others company while savoring your dishes.  middle class price? way over the top, but it's a birthday....with 2 entrees, 2 a la carte items, an app, and a bottle of wine and tip, just under 140 bucks for 2."}
{"text":"Though I have been to the Talking Stick Resort and Casino and its restaurants several times, I have never had the pleasure to eat at Orange Sky.  Orange Sky is certainly fine dining at its finest with an amazing sunset view!  It's on the 15th floor of the resort and has huge floor-to-ceiling windows for the views.  In fact, Orange Sky has a 360 degree view of the Valley of the Sun, so walk around the restaurant before or after your meal to see the different views.  My girlfriend and I were invited to join my parents for my mother's birthday.  The experience and yes, the food and drinks were all incredible!  To celebrate a special occasion, we reserved a private dining booth for the four of us.  It was comfortable with pillows, a glass wall to see the view of Scottsdale and the sunset, a wall behind us, and curtains on either side.  I learned later that minimums apply when you reserve a booth.  It was certainly worth it though!  Other spaces available for reservations include the community table, the wine room, the chef's room, the patio, and cocktail reception areas.     After we ordered drinks, we decided we wanted to order a shared plate for the four of us.  While we went back and forth between the Artisan Cheese Board (seasonal variety of cheeses, local honey, bourbon cherries, and macron almonds) or the Nosh Board (aged cheddar fondue, artisan cured meats, and vegetable pickles), we eventually went for the Artisan Cheese Board, as each of us was excited about something else on the board.  When it was time to order our food, I ordered the Mesquite Rubbed Organic Chicken with sorghum, golden raisins, tot soi.  My three guests each ordered seafood dishes:  (1) Georges Bank Diver Scallops with avocado, chile-miso butter, (2), Skuna Bay Salmon with cedar roasted, mustard gremolata, and 3 Shrimp & Scallop Steaks, prawns and divers wrapped in jalape√±o bacon.  We also ordered two accompaniments:  (1) cauliflower and aged cheddar gratin, parsnip and (2) green chile whipped potatoes.    That was plenty of food though the fun wasn't over yet!  Our wonderful wait staff brought out a special dessert with some chocolate mousse cake, chocolate gelato, and berries in a nice display.  The wait staff certainly made us feel valued, and I can see myself coming back again for another special occasion in the future.  Unfortunately, as the prices are quite high, I cannot imagine myself eating at Orange Sky for a casual meal."}
{"text":"The view is stunning,  even on a cloudy day. Our wait staff were wonderful and everyone wished my husband and I Happy Anniversary multiple times which was a nice touch. The skirt steak was very good, even better than my husband's beef tenderloin. The most delicious part of the meal for me were the sides, creamy mashed potatoes but did not get much green chili flavor and the most flavorful mushroom tart. They even gave us a piece of flourless chocolate cake with chocolate mousse for our Anniversary!"}
{"text":"This review relates primarily to a group function.  The restaurant is terrific, but other reviews might be better guides for a typical night out. Recently, Our company asked for ideas to mark 20 years in business, on which the staff then voted.  The winning idea was a spring training game followed by dinner.  That led us to the Salt River Fields and the Talking Stick Resort.  I had dined at Orange Sky (the resort's fine dining option) several times so I ended up volunteering to help with the dinner arrangements. I contacted Orange Sky and was directed to Cameo Wall, a very professional and accommodative event coordinator.  She gave us options, like a private party room, fixed menus, etc.  All communications were clear and included full details including both per person costs and total costs. Our group numbered about 45 people so Cameo requested that we work with a restricted menu.  Not a problem for us as we opted for Scallops, Salmon, Chicken and Filet options.  We polled our group to make sure we had the bases covered and the feedback was positive.  In the end, it looked like almost everyone opted for the massive 12 oz. filet.  My point here is I would not sweat too much over the number of options - a fish and a beef option would have worked fine. The 5-star rating is not so much for the atmosphere, although the view is terrific.  It is also not in particular about the food - which also was top notch.  It is purely a comment on the ease of process created by Cameo, who handled all matters with great care and delivered exactly as promised.  After this experience I would feel comfortable giving Cameo our requirements and allowing her to craft the event from beginning to end.   Only one tip needed for anyone thinking about a dining event - the 12 oz. filet made quite the impression on our staff.  We wanted them to feel pampered and out of everything we did, from open bar to rooms for the night, the filet was the standout in post party conversations.  I only comment because the standard catered menu included twin 4 oz. tournedos of beef - spend a bit extra and you will get bang for the buck."}
{"text":"Since it was my anniversary, I thought I'd go for the intimate booth ($200 order min) and trusted it would be worth it.   When we arrived to the hostess, we gave our name and time of the reservation, we were right on time.   She said o.k. and looked back down....we stood there for a little bit until we realized we were being intentionally ignored, we said we would wait right over here...(about 5 ft away)   After waiting for about 15 minutes a friendly woman came up and asked if we would like to get a cocktail or appetizer while we wait - I asked how long before our table would be ready (we HAD to take 5:30 reservation for the table, couldn't imagine it was taken)  She checked and informed us it was ready, soooooo all that standing for nothing - no \"enjoy your dinner\" or any professional comment from the dumpy hostess.  Our server was always timely but let's talk about the martinis we started out with.   The two martinis would have bought a bottle so we expected them to be top notch!   The glass was not chilled, the martini was a tad cooler than room temperature and one of the olives was one of those most people toss.  Then came the bread, room temperature, dry and unremarkable.  Salads were good, not great but good....steak was good, not great but good - was cheated on a half filled little bowl of b√©arnaise sauce (too early in the evening to run out!!!)   Chili whipped potatoes tasted like they used water instead of milk, maybe instant?  Just not good....cauliflower augrautin was o.k....not much to write about, little dry and lacking.   Dessert was o.k. but didn't taste fresh.  Yes, we made it to $200 with one disappointment after another.  So you wonder if the view made up for it???   Well, there's a parking lot, dirt field, frwy and then the sky....I'll leave the question up to you but we won't be going back, there's too many other great restaurants - all they had to do is kick it up a notch on each item to get the review they should have."}
{"text":"View is always amazing here. The best table to get are the side ones with curtains. Majority of their food is delicious. However, yesterday our steaks were overlooked and sides were cold. Service needs improvement. Service was very slow and that seems to be a pattern at this place. Otherwise great price and location!"}
{"text":"So... we eat all over Phoenix, and this is the new favorite.  Everything was essentially perfect.  Arrived on time. Seated immediately.  View is amazing (really, figure out when the sunset is and make your reservation accordingly). Service was spot on (knew the menu but didn't push things). Food was amazing from the starters to the steaks,  scallops,  and shrimp. Dessert was very original. Had drinks at the bar on the top floor with good live music (why is this hard to find in Phoenix without it being head banging music?)   All in all a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"We had dinner at the Orange Sky restaurant and it was absolutely perfect.  Our waiter,Julio, was so gracious and  very helpful.  We would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Food was good to excellent, portions were average, service was excellent, view was excellent and reservations were average. Reservation information was lacking."}
{"text":"Had the Elk.  Absolutely delicious.  Great menu of exotic meats.  Service was terrific."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Greg really was attentive and did a great job."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE!!! My husband and I dined here last night (a Tuesday) with his mom for a late Valentine's Day dinner and it was really disappointing. I am not joking when I say that we saw our server twice during our entire meal. I ordered a glass of wine from her when she came around the first time (after about 10 minutes of waiting for anyone to appear) and 20 minutes later there was no sign of my wine or of her.  I eventually had to flag down a bus boy to get it. The waitress came by the next time after the bus boy dropped off my wine and she realized that she had forgotten all about it. At this time she took both our salad and our dinner orders because we had been sitting and waiting for so long that we had plenty of time to decide on what we were going to order. This was the last time that we saw her the rest of the night. No one came by to refill our rolls. My salad had almost zero dressing on it and I had to eat it that way because no one came around to check on us at all. Our food took forever to come out of the kitchen and was delivered by the bus boy when it finally did. We wanted to order dessert and again had to flag someone down to get any type of service. After another 10 minutes the bus boy came out with the dessert tray and we were so frustrated that we declined and told him to let our server know that we just wanted the check.  Our server never appeared. A bus boy dropped the check to us and that was that. We tipped a measly 15% (which would have probably been closer to 0% had I not waited tables myself for 10 years in the past) and left. We will never go back which is a shame because the actual entrees were very good. The wine list is hugely over priced and so ridiculous for the wines that are offered. At that price point you expect impeccable food, wine selection, and service and that is just not what is being offered here.  Skip it and go to City Hall."}
{"text":"Great food, service and views. Hard to go wrong here."}
{"text":"Orange Sky had great food and ambiance- it made for the perfect girls night! When we originally got the reservation I was nervous that it would just be a standard steakhouse like I am used to in Chicago. They did have great steak options but so much more! Their sides menu was very unique and oh so delicious. We also had a vegetarian in our group and the bent over backwards to highlight the options on the menu that could be turned vegetarian AND also had a vegetarian option not listed on the menu. That was the ravioli and it was one of the best ravioli dishes I've ever had! They have an option to reserve a booth that overlooks the valley and I highly suggest this for a date night."}
{"text":"We have had good experiences at Orange Sky, but the one on Nov. 1 was not so.  Service was good, though no one could figure out who was to serve our water for the first 15 minutes we were there.  The food (lobster bisque, king crab, and steak) also tasted good, but within about 4 hours, my wife and I both became violently ill.  I reported this the next day to the hostess, who seemed completely unconcerned.  So, we also reported it directly to management, mostly so they could investigate and possibly prevent others from having the same experience.  Management, however, was also not interested in how food poisoning occurred in its restaurant.  For the price tag you pay to eat here, I'd recommend someplace else.  Most restaurants of this caliber put food safety very high on their priorities list.  Not so at Orange Sky.  (We also were there to celebrate a special occasion.  The restaurant was not half full.  Where did they put us???  Next to the restroom.)"}
{"text":"Your review helps others learn about great local businesses.  Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees  We were disappointed with our experience last night at Orange Skyt. We've dined there several times in the past with excellent results. Last night, however, did not measure up to those previous experiences. Most disappointing was the menu. Where in the past there were oysters and,other great appetizers, this time it was mostly salads. The entrees were good, but the selection was limited. All-in-all I wouldn't go out of my way to dine there again. There are restaurants with just as good menus and quality closer to home."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to the Orange Sky restaurant. My wife and I had dinner to celebrate Valentine's Day. The atmosphere, view, service and food quality was excellent. A number of menu choices were not of the traditional flair. No pasta, veal and only one chicken entree. The views are breathtaking at sunset. I know why they call it the orange sky restaurant, the setting sun casted an orange color across the western sky. The decor is very modern. There is a sky deck for viewing and dinning. The only reason I gave the restaurant a 4 was due to menu pricing. I had a Caesar salad that would be a side salad anywhere else that cost $12. The sides for dinner were expensively well over $10 for mashed potatoes. I do want to stress this is a $$$$ rating for price and the food was excellent. I will return."}
{"text":"We wanted to find a super romantic place for our Anniversary. After a lot of reviewing 5 star romantic restaurants in Scottsdale. We decided on Orange Sky for the PATIO area view. We made online reservations for a Saturday night at 5:15pm in order to see the sunset at dinner. About a week later, I called to confirm my reservation, I was told everything was in order and we have a note to put you on the patio.   A few days later, my boyfriend called just to ask about the dress code and again confirm our reservation. He was told that we no longer could be sat in the PATIO area and that a large party booked the entire PATIO area. He was quite shocked to learn that we had been booted out of the table we really wanted. He spoke with a lady manager (no name) she told us that this happens and would be putting us in the dining area now. We only booked here for the sunset view, but now we are unsure where we will be. We were pretty disappointed that we wouldn't have a view. But decided to go anyways.  Upon arrival, you have to wait a few minutes just to check in and get into the elevator. Then at the restaurant, we only had to wait a few minutes to be seated. Expecting to be in the middle of the main dining area, we were surprised that we were taken to a private booth facing the sunset on Camelback Mountain. We were thrilled! That lady manager really made our Anniversary!!   Our waitress Maggie, she was GREAT!! Very nice and attentive. Will ask for her again. The food was great too, but we both agreed that when we go back we would just do wine and a appetizer and dessert.  The main courses were good but lacking flavor. Then at the end of the night she brought us a Happy Anniversary Dessert, Very pretty and tasty. All over experience I give it 4 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Driving up and down the 101 in Scottsdale, I watched as the new tower for the Talking Stick Resort rose majestically from the desert.  Well, this Saturday it was time to check out Orange Sky, their fine dining restaurant on the 15th floor.  Winding our way through the noise and smoke of the casino floor, we were able to find the bank of elevators that whisked us up to Orange Sky.  We entered the bar area and were greeted by panoramic views.  The golf course and mountains to the east and Phoenix and Camelback Mountain to the west.  The decor is very modern and contemporary.  Kind of a minimalist style that I really like.  We ordered a drink and watched the sunset.  An orange sky, indeed!  As we walked back down a long hallway to the dining area we noticed a few private booths for two people that faced west and looked like a nice romantic seating option for our next visit.  The menu was pretty straight forward with plenty of meat and seafood options.  I ordered a rib eye steak which was huge and cooked to medium rare perfection.  The smoked cheddar mashed potatoes and asparagus sides were very good also.  My girlfriend had the shrimp cakes which were shrimp wrapped around scallops with bacon.  It's pretty hard to go wrong with that combo!  The service was good and the dining area was very attractive.  Afterwards we walked outside and noticed that there was a large patio for dining as well.  On the way back out through the casino I played a couple of slot machines and actually won!  Like T Cook's, Prado and Deseo I think this restaurant is good enough that it will attract local diners as well as the resort guests.  All in all, our group really enjoyed the experience at Orange Sky."}
{"text":"What is NOT to like about Orange Sky?  Ok, it takes a special occasion, one of those destination-type restaurants, as it will cost you a little coin.  That being said, my evening there was flawless, & gotta hand it to GM Nick Colwell.  He has an amazingly talented, superior staff, and they seamlessly manage to make you feel very special and attended to, even while they serve 300-400 dinners around you!  Great job in guding the ship, Nick.  The food and wine list reward you with the meal of the year.  Get settled in and enjoy an amazing culinary experience while watching amazing views of the sunset over the McDowells and Camelback Mountain.  Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Amazing dining experience! Took my parents to Orange Sky for Thanksgiving. I have to thank Sean, our server who provided an exceptional booth service. He even had a way to keep the curtains open to see a beautiful sunset.  We had the Rib-Eye steak and Beef Tenderloin, Nosh Board,  crushed potatoes, artichokes, bacon and Parmesan. My parents both had delish deserts, I just had another drink as they enjoyed their tasty end of the meal. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I had Salmon which was great. My wife had scallops and shrimp which the bacon wrap was fantastic.  the shrimp was not as tender as scallops.  Our sides of recommendations of the house veggies and potatoes with parmasan was fantastic.  View was great from the patio and service was great"}
{"text":"They say they have a dress code...yet they let older caucasian people in with shorts and flip flops?  Not cool Orange Sky...not cool.  (and yes, this was last night in case you're wondering when it occurred)."}
{"text":"It is very rare when I go to a restaurant with my boyfriend and have zero complaints about a place but this is a rare case. Orange Sky was everything I was expecting and more. My boyfriend ordered the Seasonal game which was Elk and I ordered the Salmon. Best Salmon Ive ever had and the Elk was indescribable.   Our waiter was very knowledgeable and kept our water glasses full. He was there when we needed him and gone when we didn't. Perfect service. I would love to come back.   My only concern is they called me the night before our reservation to see if we were still going to show up, i said yes and then she asked me if it was a special occasion and I told her it was my boyfriends birthday. I asked if they could do anything special for him and she told me she would bring him a complimentary desert. Unfortunately the dessert never showed up. I don't know if they forgot or if the lady that called me just didn't put it in my reservation notes. But the experience was so amazing that i didn't even mind. and the food was so delicious that we didn't even want dessert anyways."}
{"text":"Food was really good, ambience was amazing. Definitely try the king crag dish, it's  on point  lol it's expensive, my bill for 2 people was $295 with a $30 tip. But definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Everything about this venue was positive--the atmosphere, the food and the service.  It is a great place to celebrate a special occasion or a romantic evening."}
{"text":"Finally!  Being able to make reservations on line is fantastic.  I often choose where to go based on if I can make reservations on line!  It's easy, fast and you can make the reservations at any time of the day or night.   Excellent!"}
{"text":"Far above the Valley crowds on the busiest March weekend of the year we scored a west view table to celebrate engagement with our daughter and fianc√©, thanks Yelp SeatMe!  Maggie provided excellent, knowledgable service. One waitstaff came between us and the sunsetting view which contributed to my less than perfect rating. Our group was generally pleased with the food but my bacon wrapped scallop/shrimps were a bit over done. On three previous visits the food seemed more exceptional; not sure if they have changed or if my expectations have changed. Anyway, the view at Orange Sky is consistently a perfect 10!"}
{"text":"We celebrated our 16th anniversary at Orange Sky. We sat on the patio and it couldn't have been lovelier. Cool breeze, the sound of the water feature,oh yes, and the food. First of all our waiter wasJulio, he was honest, helpful and gave us great tips on the menu. Our steaks were melt in your mouth  delicious. The sides were tasty and generous in proportion. Believe them when they say: serves 2. To top it off, they provided a complimentary sweet anniversary dessert. Such a lovely time. Thanks to Mark Kieru and his crew!"}
{"text":"I am a native Phoenician, and have experienced many great upscale steak restaurants in the valley...and let me tell you, this was not one of them!  I thought it would be a nice surprise to take my wife here on New Years Eve. My first mistake was not having the knowledge that it was a fixed menu, but also not seeing anything about that on their site.  The fixed menu was $135.00 per person, and nothing on their prepared menu was appealing to either one of us. The appetizer choice sounded great, and was lobster, but when they brought it out, my wife started laughing, because the lobster was a piece the size of a penny...we were wondering what happened to the rest. The salad was something we both had never seen before, it looked like oregano with a little dressing mixed in. The main entree we picked was Sea Bass, and actually that was delicious, and prepared very well.  We both were hoping for some type of steak, but all they were offering was Elk and Buffalo, which neither one of us cared for. The dessert was something with peanut butter in it. As you probably figured we left the table hungry.  The biggest surprise was when we received our bill, and were shocked when the total was $460.00...For Two! We did get 3 drinks with our meal, 2 wines and 1 specialty cocktail, but $460.00...Wow!  Oh, that did include a 22% gratuity that they automatically added.  It was a very slow time at 6:00, and the servers were just standing around staring at our table...very uncomfortable.  When we walked in to the hostess stand there were 8 hostesses waiting to greet us...a little overkill.  The views are great here, but only if you are sitting next to a window, and the sun hasn't set, but other than that, the inside of the restaurant isn't very appealing or comfortable. I don't think we will ever dine here again, especially with so many great steak and fish restaurants in town. This does not even come close to Maestro's, Dominik's or Steak 44. At least at these restaurants we leave very satisfied and with a bill half that price."}
{"text":"The ambience is perfect! The restaurant resides on the 15th floor and is surrounded by beautiful views. At sunset you have breathtaking views of the orange sky as the sunsets behind the mountains. There are private booths right at the glass, ask for them when making a reservation. As for the food it is good. We shared the pumpkin seed crusted shrimp, best part of the meal. The bread is warm and the butter is soft. We ordered the 8 oz sirloin and the lamb chops. Sirloin had a nice char and good flavor. The lamb chops were just ok. The sweet potato with goat cheese was tasty and the corn with duck egg was good as well. They surprised us with a chocolate dessert and gelato that was rich and delicious."}
{"text":"Booked a week in advance. Informed them it was our 48th wedding anniversary. Asked for a window seating. When we arrived, seated in middle of room, even though there was a window table avail. After expressing our disappointment, grudgingly seated by window. Food average. Lobster Tamale had few bites of lobster, and tamale very dry, tasteless. Lobster Rissotto same. No lobster. Other than window seating, service was excellent. View great, room a little sterile."}
{"text":"We took mom here for dinner last night. It's a place we've been wanting to try for a while.   The view is stunning and we loved the private booths you can reserve. We sat in the restaurant area and as we were guided to our table, employees smiled and greeted us. The service was incredible and professional. The food choices included a variety of foods including scallop steaks, elk, steak, seafood, and lots of vegetable sides.  The wine list was extensive. We enjoyed wine by the glass: the Merlot and Tempranillo were tasty.  We started with the cheese board which offered 6 different cheeses, bourbon cherries, local honey, almonds and some bread. Our server described them all and they were all delicious, especially the smoked blue cheese.  Our table ordered the elk, beef tenderloin, and shrimp and scallops wrapped in jalape√±o bacon. The bacon was a bit spicy but didn't impede the ability to eat and enjoy the dish. We also ordered the side of asparagus and the corn which was a mix of sweet corn, asparagus, chard and bacon. We finished off with Peet's pressed coffee and the Frozen Chocolate Dome and Rhubarb Tart.    All the portions were just the right size that we finished everything.  This is definitely a place we would visit again. The dress code states business casual so it didn't have that stuffy dressed up feel to it.  We came directly from work and were dressed appropriately."}
{"text":"Blown away! The photos on the Orange Sky Yelp page DO NOT do the ambiance or food any justice. The lighting is super dark & sexy, which makes for blah photos, but amazing in-the-moment vibes. So, prepare to be impressed! Also, request a spot out on the patio... you'll feel like you're on a luxurious vacation somewhere far far away from Phoenix. Very classy.   Food-wise, also very impressed. I expected glorified casino buffet food, but Orange Sky was truly gourmet. Steaks were cooked expertly, veggie sides were unique and seasonal, and the prices were actually not that bad. Mains were $25-40, and the wine list is long with plenty of affordable bottles.   We sat outside on the covered patio, but the inside area is huge if you prefer staying out of that glorious dry Arizona air. There are even private seating nooks, for an extra intimate date night.   I was nervous about Orange Sky being too wannabe-classy, too pricey, or just lacking character, but I was completely proven wrong. Definitely recommended to impress yourself, a date, or a large group!"}
{"text":"Food and Location are amazing.  Demetrio was outstanding in his service.  The crab is amazing...the shrimp and scallops a well...pretty much a homerun every visit!"}
{"text":"This place is quite a catch. I would never have guessed such a high end restaurant would be at a casino. From the live music ambiance to the glassware for drinks, it is quite exquisite. I will definitely be coming back. We came in Christmas Eve and were delighted by the welcoming lights that decorated each floor of the casino, and the restaurant itself.   After a few cocktails in the lounge area, we were escorted to our table. The experience was communicative and fluid from start to finish."}
{"text":"Food was amazing, i suggest the beef cheek and elk. The service was wonderful, would definitely dine again."}
{"text":"We went to Orange Sky for our anniversary, and I was really nervous after having read some negative reviews. Big mistake on my part for putting any thought into the reviews.  The entire experience was incredible. It makes me really wonder what people's expectations are when they review. The hostess had our reservation for a VIP booth and we were sat within 10 minutes to a great night sky view of Scottsdale. Our waitress (Lorraine) was great. She was really attentive without being intrusive. The meal itself was incredible and not nearly as expensive as I was expecting. A nice desert was provided with a \"Happy Anniversary\" on the plate. I'm sure it is a standard when they get an anniversary reservation, but still a nice thought. We would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"I love it here. The food is phenomenal and the view is amazing.  I had a birthday celebration here and the staff was so sweet to help us celebrate. I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Terrible, worst piece of meat ever, save your money. All this restaurant has to offer is a view.  Pre drinks: Bartender was dense, unprofessional, and unapologetic when questioned. He was obviously unhappy with his career choice as a mixologist.    Dinner: We were seated 40 minutes after our reservation. Seated at a table that was set for three when our party was four. We waited awkwardly for our lackluster team of servers to dig up a chair and table setting. Three of us ordered ribeye. One steak was undercooked, one overcooked, and one was just right. I was lucky enough to be delivered the Goldilocks steak. Shame on you chef for your uninspired preparation of such a wonderful cut of meat, the cow herself should feel disrespected. In an effort to self-season with salt and pepper I found none on our table. With no waiter in site I helped myself to the salt and pepper from the empty uncleared table next to us. Potatoes and cauliflower were dry and had the appearance and texture of food fresh from a microwave.  Our wine was wonderful. Our server managed to successfully opened it and poured it flawlessly. This was the high point of our meal and I'm proud of him. No dessert or coffee.   Be prepared for mediocrity, both service and food. You're paying for the view."}
{"text":"Very nice experience with a nice view.  Window tables require a minimum spend. Pork shank was very delicious."}
{"text":"Orange Sky we tried yesterday evening. We only were able to get in at 8:30pm which was ok since we live so far away and I work on the weekends. One of the first things we noticed is we waited on our table for about 20 minutes and then afterwards once we were seated I counted at least 20 open tables in the dinning area we were in and that didn't include the exterior seating....Also when I asked about the private table the lady told me those book up a week or 2 weeks before and they don't have any availability but they remained empty the entire time we were there....Interesting just because such a nice restaurant you would think that this restaurant would over book for those that book 2 reservations and let their date pick and don't bother to cancel one of the reservations. The waiter Julio we had was an absolute GEM! He had such a sweetness and sincerity we just loved. He was just head on with his suggestions for food and we really enjoyed the experience even more with him helping us make our food selections. We loved the Elk cooked medium rare it was absolutely to die for. We also go the shrimp and scallop wrapped in bacon that we really enjoyed and topped off dinner with the lemon cheese cake which was really light and tasty as well.  We will definitely be back and hope you will take some of the thoughts I have put into this review into consideration when booking your restaurant to the \"T\". Someone like Julio could make more money as a waiter and be delighting lots of customers and it really would be neat to see that place full. Overall I loved it and had a really great time there!"}
{"text":"Had amazing meal, amazing vino DRC, and service was A+! Topped it off with a great sunset! Can't wait to do it again!!"}
{"text":"The experience at Orange Sky was phenomenal. The sunset view from the private dining was amazing. Took my girlfriend as a surprise. The food was prepared to perfection and our waiter Bradford was first class all the way. I would recommend if you are celebrating a milestone or something special give this place a try you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"5 star restaurant all around! Our dinner was soooo good and the service was incredible. They treated us so well here. The view was beautiful (we had reservations right at sunset). We ordered margaritas, ribeye and mashed potatoes and they were all delicious but the best thing we got was the scallops. They were wrapped in bacon with a jalapeno flavor that was the best thing I've ever had! I could have eaten way more of those. The cost of the dinner was up there but it's nice to treat yourself every once in awhile and we'll be back again!"}
{"text":"Had a few drinks at the bar....what an amazing view of the Phoenix/Scottsdale area!  The night I was there, a piano player was playing jazz standards and some cover songs.....excellent Wine selection and the house Zinfandel was superb!  The bartenders here are very friendly and accommodating.  I can't wait to come back here with my Better Half to give dinner a try.  Return Factor - 95%"}
{"text":"We did the private dinning booth at Orange Sky. It has a $200 minimum, which wasn't hard to reach with food and drinks for three. We did an early reservation to watch the sunset. One thing you should know, even if you have a 5 pm reservation, they do not open the doors to the elevator until 5 pm on the dot. The view from the private booth wasn't as great as I expected, as this side of the building overlooks at an empty dirt lot. The other side of the building has a better view. However, when I visited the main dinning area, I was really glad we booked the private dinning booth. Our experience was peaceful, relaxing, intimate, with great service. The main dinning area was louder, with a lot more going on. We order some cocktails and a bottle of wine. I got the limoncello cocktail, which was just what I was in the mood for (crisp, balanced, refreshing!). For entrees, we all ordered different steaks, and we were all happy with them! Our servicer went out of his way to make sure he truly understood how I wanted my New York Strip cooked. And when it arrived, it was cooked perfectly! For our accompaniments, we ordered the crushed potatoes, whipped potatoes, and brussel sprouts, which were on special for the night. I couldn't pick a favorite out of the three! Our server nicely brought out a little dessert for our celebration at the end of the night!"}
{"text":"I called 3 times over the span of a week to make a reservation for a sizable bachelor party. No one ever picked up the phone (yes, I called during business hours). I ended up leaving a message with my information, but no one ever called me back. They basically left $1,000+ laying on the table.  If you want to be the big place you claim to be, you can start with answering your phones."}
{"text":"Tipping back the Malibu and you lose track of time... oops! Thank goodness we could order appetizers at Orange Sky.   Anitpasti plate with prosciutto, sopressata, ciabatta bread, olives, artichokes, and asparagus was good. Didn't touch the portobella mushrooms (GAHROSS!!), duck confit (DOUBLE GAHROSS) or the goat cheeses on the plate though... Could've done without those!   The lobster bisque tasted like someone poured it out of a can :o( but to their credit, this IS Arizona and I don't usually have bisque comparable to Seattle or San Francisco.   They made up for the bisque with the Tenderloin Tips served as requested at medium rare. Melt in your mouth good! The garlic steak fries and smoked cheddar whipped Yukon potatoes were quickly devoured! It's a jip though if you want any sauce on anything because they charge extra.   The tab was way overpriced for an Indian Casino. I mean, really. This isn't a hot spot in the middle of Vegas, Miami or Los Angeles but they priced those places out of the stratosphere. Will I go back? Probably not... unless it goes on the expense account!"}
{"text":"First time at Orange Sky with friends. We had a private booth, which was nice - just missed the sunset which was disappointing. The service was great. Prices are reasonable for the ambiance, service, and food quality. I had the Pacific halibut, which was delicious. The sides were okay - the flavors were a little too complex. Overall, a good experience."}
{"text":"Pretty decent restaurant.  The atmosphere was very cool!  You take an elevator all the way up to the restaurant/bar area, with great views from all sides of the building.  The food was excellent as well!  We didn't care for the snotty waitress or manager.  My wife, sister, brother in law, and myself all went here for a late dinner.  We are all in our early to mid thirties.  They asked for our ID's at the table for drinks (no issue).  However, I didn't like that the waitress took our ID's away from the table and into the back bar area.  I asked her to come back with them, and she explained it was policy so I asked to speak to her manager, who basically rolled her eyes at me.  From that point forward, our service definitely suffered.  I wasn't trying to be a pain in the @ss, I just don't feel it is appropriate to take all our personal information away from the table where we can't see them.  It wasn't like we were questionable in age."}
{"text":"Every year my husband and I compete to see who can take the other to the best place for thier birthday dinner.  We have been to all the top places in AZ and I was excited to add Orange Sky to the list.    We got a private booth - I timed it at sun set.  The private booth gives you a sofa like bench facing the window to watch the sun setting, with curtains on both sides.  Very private, romantic and breath taking.  The food is good quality food.  It's not the best meal I have ever eaten but it was very well cooked and tasted great!  This is a perfect place to go to WOW someone, especially someone special."}
{"text":"Beautiful setting on the 15th floor. Excellent food and service. A little pricey, but worth it."}
{"text":"We had a reservation for 8 people on the west side of the outdoor section of this restaurant. This was the first visit here by any of us? One word describes our experience- OUTSTANDING! From our entrance into Orange Sky, the ambience and service was great. Everyone was very welcoming and more than friendly/courteous. Our service was exceptional and the food was equal! Our party had several dishes- salmon, filet, oysters, scallops, lamb, sweet potatoes, asparagus etc. All was prepared and cooked to perfection . Several times throughout the meal, our party would comment on how delicious their meal was. We finished the meal off with creamed br√ªl√©e , chocolate mousse and sherbet. The scenery at sunset added to the overall enjoyment of the evening. In all, this dining experience was everything and more. Than we expected. We all will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"This can be a great and fun place if you get a good server. High enegy in the place. Friendly. Decent music. Large menue with interesting choices. Great wine cellar and they will sometime negotiate the price of the bottle of wi ne."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dining experience at the Orange Sky.  The private sunset dining booth was perfect for our anniversary.  The wait-staff were very polite and the place has many servers to make your experience an A+. The menu was very unique and offered a wide range of choices.  I got to try Elk for the first time and enjoyed it.  Our personal waiter was very cordial and knowledgeable. I am so happy that I got to surprise my Wife with this special experience."}
{"text":"This was simply an amazing experience. The atmosphere was elegant with great night views of parts of the valley. I had the beef tenderloins which came out in two 4oz fillets and were cooked perfectly and were very tender. The bearnaise sauce as well as the red wine sauce was a great addition. My wife had the King Crab legs (8oz after being deshelled) and she said they were amazing. The lemon seasoned asparagus and mashed potato sides were quite tasty. The large wine selection would have made it difficult to choose if I didn't immediately go for the Pinot Noir as my go-to choice, which was excellent as well."}
{"text":"I wanted to be wowed... I really did.  Any why wouldn't I? Date night with my lady at a restaurant that has received rave reviews... I definitely gave this place the benefit of the doubt. But alas, my three star rating is quite generous.  I'll start with the good-- the ambiance was perfect, the decor was tasteful.  We didn't get to enjoy the famous sunset view-- our reservations were at 8pm and it was raining, but even without the sunset, I thought the ambiance was tasteful and the staff was not pretentious.  I loved the very open,spacious feel of the bar and dining areas and the variety of seating options/configurations in the bar area.  The private booths facing the windows also seemed like a nice touch-- although we did not experience them as we were seated in the main dining room. Even though it was May, since it was rainy outside they had a gas fireplace going in the main dining room that added a nice coziness.  The food itself was okay-- inconsistent in quality and texture, but not inedible for the most part. We were there for Restaurant Week and selected a first course, entree, and dessert from the Restaurant Week menu.  As a note, we were informed by our server that none of the items on the menu for Restaurant Week are available normally-- that these were special offerings only for this week.  For my first course, I had the white asparagus salad. Not bad, but not remarkable in any way-- just standard salad with standard dressing. My partner had the roasted artichoke bisque which had a thin film on the top of it leading us to believe it had been sitting out for quite some time.  She commented that it didn't taste fresh-- like it had possibly come from a pre-made mixture.  In addition, it was loaded with pancetta-- which she said overpowered the subtle roasted artichoke taste with \"meatiness\". Ew.  The dinner rolls that were brought to the table were hard, and stale tasting (not \"crunchy\")--  the dinner rolls served at school cafeterias and nursing homes are tastier. Seriously.   For our entrees, we both ordered the grilled steelhead salmon. And cue the inconsistencies.... My salmon was fairly overcooked and quite dry.  To be fair, this is better than it being undercooked--  I'm normally a strict vegetarian, but I do enjoy fish occasionally even though it kind of creeps me out to eat an animal of any sort-- and rare/raw fish would have been a deal breaker for me.  The seasoning was tasty and overall I did enjoy the fish.  However, my partner's salmon came *very* rare-- like sushi rare.  It was seared on the outside, but cool in the middle.  Now I know it's typical for salmon to be served medium rare-- but this was RARE rare.   Both of our potatoes were very undercooked and difficult to eat.  The grilled campari tomatoes were the one delicious exception to the plate-- they were delicious, flavorful, and nicely presented.  Finally, there was a disparity in the temperature of our meals-- mine was piping hot, while my partner's was lukewarm at best.  Now mind you, we ordered the exact same entree that came out of the kitchen at the exact same time.  So why the difference?  My guess is that with it being Restaurant Week, the kitchen was pre-cooking these meals en masse and the attention to detail went by the wayside.  Nonetheless, not an acceptable excuse--Restaurant Week should be an opportunity for restaurants to highlight their best dishes and talents in hopes of bringing in more business-- not to churn out subpar food that turns patrons off from ever visiting again to enjoy their standard menu.    We both had the chocolate pot de creme for desert and it was completely delectable-- no complaints there.  The texture was smooth and creamy and the chocolate was flavorful without being too sweet or bitter.  I wonder if it is a coincidence that the best part of the meal was the one part of the meal that it is acceptable to prepare ahead of time?!   All in all, it was not a horrible experience-- the ambiance and dessert were wonderful.  I doubt I'd return again for dinner, but perhaps for cocktails and dessert."}
{"text":"We went to Orange Sky for our 34th wedding anniversary dinner.  We picked Orange Sky in part because of the great view of the sunset.  Unfortunately, it was a rare cloudy/rainy evening in Scottsdale.  We started the evening in the lounge, which was very nice.  Windows all around and plenty of comfortable, intimate seating.  Drinks are expensive with mixed drinks around $15 and bottle of beer around $6.  The mixed drinks were very good though and a reasonable size.  You are required to close out your lounge bill before going to dinner, so I don't believe your lounge bill will not count toward the private dining booth minimum.  I should also add that the live jazz trio in the lounge sounded very good and provided nice background music, not too loud.  We then moved into the main dining room, which is nice with windows all around and a beautiful outdoor area, which you can visit during your meal.  Overall the room was very nice, the tables were seated a nice distance apart so it didn't feel crowded at all.  We had a birthday party of about 25 people seated next to us and we could still reasonably hear each other.  The room did get somewhat uncomfortably warm during the evening, which detracted from the enjoyment of the evening.  Service during the evening was very good, but not flawless.  Our primary waiter was very nice and provided answers to our questions about the food.  Our water was kept full without asking.  We did have to slice up our shared appetizer and pour our own wine refills.  And when the food arrived it was a bit awkward placing all the dishes on the table.  the food was the highlight of the evening.  We had two different entrees - wild boar ($34) and skirt steak ($29).  Both were outstanding - flavorful and just as described by our waiter.  I had a good sized portion of the wild boar, probably close to 10 ounces, which was tender and served with gnocci. We had three sides, the cauliflower gratin, the sweet potatoes, and the crushed potatoes.  These were all good but not great, but were definitely enough for two as stated in the menu, and were around $10 each.  Complimentary bread was also served with meal, which was good but just two types of simple bread.  We had a bottle of wine with dinner, Fess Parker 2014 Syrah, which was very good and reasonably priced at $45.  We did not order dessert, were given a small complimentary dessert in honor of our anniversary, which was very nice.  I believe our total bill including pre-dinner drinks, wine, appetizer, 3 entrees and 3 sides was around $300 including tax and tip.  Overall, it was a very nice evening and I would defintely return to Orange Sky for a special dinner."}
{"text":"Wow - what a fantastic view of the entire city. This restaurant is on the 15th floor of the Talking Stick Casino and Resort. I've never seen a layout quite like this before.   You go up the elevator to the 15th floor, the door opens to a very spacious bar and floor to ceiling windows facing west (perfect for a sunset dinner). They held our reservation with delight (although we were a little late) while we enjoyed a cocktail and live music in the bar area.   Once we entered the dining room I knew this place was unique. There are HUGE captain sofa's facing west with unobstructed views of the entire city. I can only explain this ambiance by saying, you literally have your own living room while you eat. The staff was more than accommodating, 2 waiters to each table. Although that seems like too much, they balanced it out perfectly so we weren't annoyed at all. Actually my date and I ended up having a great conversation with Jeff, a server from Duluth Minnesota (where my family is from)   Prices are comparable to Mastro's although I did only give 4 stars because my steak was a little too done. But it was still really good.   Then I went down to the casino and lost $100 bucks - bummer! LOL!  When Spring Training starts I bet this place will go OFF! There are several banquet rooms that looked really fun for parties of 12."}
{"text":"We ate here on Easter.  Manny was our server.  I have never had better service than we had with this young man.  He is 22 and knew what wines to par with what we were eating.  Every recommendation was top notch.  The food was probably in my all time top 3 places I have ever eaten.  Best meal.  Orange Sky should do everything in their power to keep this young man - Manny you will do great things in this world!!!"}
{"text":"Our waiter, Will, was terrific. He provided an overview of the menu and answered all of our questions. He was very personable and was very attentive to our needs throughout our meal.   The restaurant atmosphere was superb and the view was great from almost any place you sat. One thing we didn't know was that there were seats behind a curtain along the wall on the left as you were shown to your seats in the main dining room. Those seats provided a great view of the distant horizon. But, the seats came at a cost of $200 just for the view. If you want romance, the seats are well worth the extra cost.  My wife ordered Saut√©ed Foie Gras and I had a Green Salad. The Foie Gras looked delicious, but my Duncan Farm Field Salad had a lot to be desired. I definitely would not order the salad again.  My wife ordered the Diver Scallops and I ordered the Skuna Bay Salmon. As a side, we shared the Crushed Potatoes with Sherry Vinegar, Pancetta and Parmesan. The side was okay except it was overpowered by the vinegar. The Diver Scallops were delicious and my cedar-blanked Salmon was okay. It wasn't prepared with a bourbon hickory sauce, but it did come with a raspberry chutney, which I enjoyed.  I forgot to mention, we had a Sweet Muddled Southern Comfort to start our meal, but found the drink was short on Southern Comfort. We asked to have the drink strengthened and found out later that we were charged for the extra shots.   As I said earlier, our waiter did a great job, but I found the food lacking. I don't think I will be trying the restaurant right away again. For the price, the meal should have been a lot better.  Janet & Roger Race"}
{"text":"I reserved this restaurant a while ago as I wanted my hubby and son to have a nice steak or seafood dinner when we arrived in Scottsdale....plus I heard the view of the sunset is amazing. I got 2 responses to my question on yelp if they would make a vegan, gf meal for me....both said yes. I even got a phone call a couple of days before my reservation and the lady told me there is no separate vegan menu but they can tell me some options when I arrive. We arrived and took the elevator up to the restaurant on the 15th floor. The large open lounge was lovely with windows all around. We were taken through a long Hall that had private dining rooms and sectioned off sofa seating facing the window to see the sunset.....a romantic date night experience I think. We were in the main dining room by the window and they opened the curtains for us to view the sunset. I captured it in time-lapse on my phone. The patio seating was full but we were able to go out there and see the infinity pool on the patio and the lovely view of the mountains. When it came time to order, I was told the vegan option was a vegetable plate. No tofu, no quinoa or grains, just a variety of vegetables. There was no vegan/gf option for appetizer. I was very annoyed and did let my server, Lori, and the manager (Nicole?) know. For such a high end restaurant I expected a lot better in terms of options. My guys ordered 3 apps.....crab and corn fritters, crusted shrimp and mushroom bruschetta. They loved all of them. I really wanted to be upset with my vegetable plate but the chef did a good job. The sweet potato was cooked nicely and topped with walnuts. The shredded Brussels sprouts were warm and too salty, but flavourful. The collard greens/mushrooms/onions were glazed in balsamic I think and were spicy. The asparagus was steamed and bland. Overall, the veg plate was decent. My son had the angel food cake for dessert but said it was too plain. The staff were friendly and nice, but a little slow in clearing dishes. The food arrived quickly. The decor was very nice and the washrooms were clean and decent. The pricing was on the expensive side but overall it was a better experience than I expected when I first sat down."}
{"text":"The best food in Arizona, great customer service and always checking up to make sure you good at the right times"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. We were so excited to try this place and made a reservation to watch the sunset from the dining room. There is a $200 minimum for certain tables but I was reassured by 'Joyce' more than once that this was not one of those tables. When we arrived they questioned our intentions with our table, whether we were having a full dinner service or appetizers or what. I mentioned that I was told the table I reserved had no minimum but the girl who led us to it said we had to all have dinner. Not everyone wanted full dinner service but would rather share some things off the regular menu. They said that wasn't possible and escorted us back to the lounge. We ordered drinks and appetizers from the lounge menu and got an appetizer from the regular menu (and still spent over $200) but were brought zero silverware so couldn't eat it and needed to get someone to the airport. The waitress was nowhere to be found for the majority of the time and I had to chase her down to pay the tab. Oh, the view is good though if all the other bs is worth your time. Won't be back. There's better views and better service at plenty of other places"}
{"text":"Nice romantic dinner with a great view. The risotto was excellent as well as the scallops."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of eating at the Orange Sky  Restaurant last night in the Talking Stick Casino.  The menu was in good taste and the food was delicious.   To compliment our dining experience we had the pleasure of Will Bennett as our server. This man gave us extremely great service and has the Work Ethic of a true Professional.   We will be returning and upon making the reservation are going to specify Will Bennett as our server"}
{"text":"The Appearance of the entire restaurant was very appealing. Large glass windows throughout followed by outside seating with wrap around glass.  Including a negative edge pool overlooking the golf course. Views of the sunset were breathtaking.  They did have private seating for a romantic evening. In this case I was there for a business meeting.  So our main server was very friendly and welcoming however everyone else didn't seem very happy or friendly. No one wanted to smile so I thought they were all crabby.   They have an extensive wine selection which was nice. The food was good but not amazing. I expected the food to taste as good as the entire place looked.  All-in-all great evening and will definitely come back for special occasion.  On our way out we found out there was a club on the 14th floor so of course we had to see for ourselves. Great music, dance floor and bar but hardly anyone there. Must have been special invite only. Lol"}
{"text":"Vacationing in Arizona has become a preoccupation for me because I want to move to the west coast. I explore food web-site to find cheap eats, food market and fine dining. I found Orange Sky while searching views of the desert.¬† The food is outstanding with very attentive service.¬† If your ever in Scottsdale treat yourself to a fantastic dinner with a view."}
{"text":"The restaurant is located on the 15th floor of the towers at Talking Stick casino/resort/spa.  It was an unplanned visit, after the blackjack tables.    The entrance of the restaurant has dark wood floors and a jazz pianist with a singer to create a lounge feel.  I felt that the lounge needed more sofas and comfortable seating.  it seemed like an afterthought.    As you walk down the hallway, there are high backed sofas on your left that overlook - the parking lot???  These are by reservation only and require a $150 minimum on the weekends.  (Views of the parking lot at street level are free)  There are private dining rooms on the right side of the hallway which seat 6 and 16-18 respectfully.  The prices were appropriate for a large group, especially if you are sampling the wine.    The large dining room boasts a dual sided fireplace and sophisticated atmosphere.  There are several large booths along the outer edge and tables near the fireplace.  Service was excellent and as was the wine. I had a steak, truffled potatoes and seasonal squash and vegetables.  The steak was cooked medium rare and had a mushroom ragout sauce on the side.  It was satisfactory and the sauce added to the flavor.  Personally, I prefer my steak to stand on its own merits and not rely on the sauce.  The best side dish was the vegetables, which were sauteed in butter and a pinch of salt.    The outside patio is beautiful, with a small, central infinity pool and pillowed bench seating around it.  There are small tables and chairs, with some near the other side of the dual fireplace.  Again, this would be a fantastic place to see the sunset, if it were facing west and did not have views of the infamous parking lot.    This restaurant was very poorly planned with regards to layout.  It distracts you from the ok food but is saved somewhat by the quality of the wine."}
{"text":"This place is great!!!  My husband and I took my parents here for their 50th wedding anniversary anniversary and we were not disappointed.   Let me begin by saying you won't find a better view of the valley than from this restaurant.    We arrived while it was still light out and left at night so we got to witness the beautiful sunset.   The restaurant provides floor to ceiling glass windows that provide a 360 degree view of the valley.  Everything was topnotch.   Like another reviewer stated you do have two food servers which is great.   If you need anything during the course of your meal there is always someone close by to attend to your needs.   These are the items that were ordered by members of our party:  Antipasti Plate, Roast Pork Chop, Mixed Grill, Roast Rack of Lamb, Alaskan King Crab Legs, Crab Louie Salad, Wild Mushroom Risotto, artichoke au gratin.  Everything was superb!!    They did bring us out a special dessert complimentary due to the occasion.   All the drinks we ordered were prepared correctly also.   It is pricey so be prepared to shell out a few dollars but it's worth it."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful dinner. I went with the wild game (Elk Loin). AMAZING!  Think Elk Filet Minion!  Cooked to a pure medium rare. I ordered the Shitake mushrooms and Kale as a side. Both were amazing. The Elk had a sweetness to it but yet not gamey.  They have a great wine and scotch list."}
{"text":"We got the private booth. It was a very nice view and very private. The service was good. I have the tenderloin steak which was excellent and my girlfriend had the Ribeye steak. The ribeye steak was just average and actually was a little bit disappointing.  The sweet potatoes was downright awful. The crushed potatoes were much better. Our salads were excellent"}
{"text":"Ok, it's hard to write a review of this place because there's simply so much to talk about. I would also like to point out that this is a FIVE STAR review for me. I rarely give 5 yelp stars on my reviews. Yeah, I'm that picky.  We've known about this place for years, but just never seemed to make it over there. My loss. Totally my loss. Wow! We went there to celebrate our 19th anniversary. Easy parking, and plenty of it. After we parked, we went inside and followed the signs to Orange Sky. It was a bit hard to find because it's accessed by a specific set of elevators that are inside the casino. Once we arrived at the restaurant (15th floor) we were greeted with a very hip, lively ambiance.  There's a lounge close to the elevator, where there are plenty of places to, well, ... lounge. Large full cocktail bar and there was live music. If I had known it was such a destination, we would've gone early to have a few drinks.  Instead we went to the maitre d and were seated. There's all kinds of seating you can choose from. There are quite a large number of private cubbies facing the glass wall so you can enjoy the sunset (seats up to 4), there are larger rooms decorated with wine bottles (seats 10), main dining area, patio, and larger banquet rooms for large parties (25+, 50+). The patio is a large space outside (with heaters) where you can eat alfresco. Inside the main dining room is very elegant and spacious.  We chose the main dining room. Our server, Julio, was simply one of the best servers we've ever had. He first wanted to know how we wanted to pace ourselves -- if we were on a timeframe or not. We said we weren't on a timeframe, and wanted a leisurely dinner. We ordered cocktails and he encouraged us to leave the table, walk around the patio, admire the view, and he would bring us our cocktails wherever we were. That was fantastic.   Once we finished our cocktails on the patio (yes he found us!), we went back inside, ordered apps and wine. The food came quickly and was simply perfect. Dinner came after that and I must say, the steak I ordered was delicious. Dessert consisted of grappa and a small 'anniversary' dessert. We rolled out of there, we were so full.  This place is a bit pricey, but it's an amazing restaurant with awesome ambiance and definitely a place to go for a fancy date, romantic dinner, or just to impress the boss or out of town guests.   But when you go, please request Julio if you remember. His name was on a different review for this restaurant and for good reason. He'll give you awesome service!"}
{"text":"This was my fifth visit to OS. With each visit it has has lost a touch it's luster and shine.   Last night we started our experience with the leaving us waiting at the hostess stand for 30 minutes despite the fact they weren't busy. Did I mention my wife is 6 months pregnant?  When we got our table it looked very promising. We had 2 servers. At first I thought it was because 1 was in training, but I soon realized there were 2 servers for each table. In the end we got the service equivalent to having 3/4 of a server.   The food was good, but not worth the cost."}
{"text":"Ate here while staying at the resort. Our waiter was great, though the food was just ok. I personally wouldn't eat at this restaurant next time we're in town.   The olives I. Our martinis were the smallest I've been served in a martini. The salads were not great. My salmon was perfectly cooked & delicious."}
{"text":"We went to this place for our anniversary. When they called me to confirm my reservation, they told me I have to spend more than $200 for the table with the view. Are u serious? I went to many nice restaurant and I was never asked this question. It was very disappointing and made me very uncomfortable going to this place. This is big NoNo. We went there anyway. It is located in talking stick resort and U have to go through the casino to get to the elevator to restaurant. It is in 15th floor and as u walk out u will see the host. I was not pleased with the way they greeted us(didn't look ready). The lady explained about the private rooms and booth as we were walking to our table and she again mentioned that people have to spend $100/person in order to have those rooms. Ahhhh, please Do Not mention about how much we have to spend here. Considering this is upscale restaurant, it was very disappointing. And the restaurant was pretty empty including those tables with the view.  Finally we got to our table and our server, Julio, was introduced. We ordered the NY stip, skirt beef, shrimp and scallop, buffalo soup, etc... I have to say everything was really good. The buffalo soup was superb and the beet salad was very fresh. The skirt steak was little bit salty but perfectly cooked. The NY strip was also very good and goes well with the wine sauce. The shrimp and scallop wrapped with the bacon was very tasty. Julio provided us delicious dessert and he was very great. The views were not that impressive but better than nothing.  Will I be back? Maybe...they seriously need to get rid of those rules and stop telling us how much we need to spend. This is why i am giving them 3 stars despite of delicious food and our great server."}
{"text":"This was some of the BEST food I've had in a long time!! The lobster must melted in your mouth and the the bacon wrapped prawns stuffed with a sliver of jalapeno made you wanna \"slap yo mama!\"  The service was phenomenal and the views are amazing!! Make sure you go during the sunset! The restaurant is on top of Talking Stick Casino on the 17th floor, and when the fun sets on the mountains it's a thing of beauty!!"}
{"text":"Four of us had a girls weekend and choose Orange Sky for our big night out Friday. Last month we celebrated my brothers birthday. Beginning, leaving a voicemail to make reservations is not a good idea. This is a high class place, don't have first impression of not being just that. Also, I'm not sure why, with an expensive restaurant, the valet parking lot was full from the gamblers. I think it would make sense to at least accomodate the patrons that will be eating. So in we came, dressed to the nines, from the back forty. Not another great start. That all said, Orange Sky is breathtakingly beautiful! The food is fabulous! Fine dining at it's best... except for the three times we've been in the past year, the waiters need either more experience, or much better trained or both. Normally when fine dining the waiters are truly pro's.  4 stars is not a bad review so do yourself a favor and try Orange Sky. For management, I gave 4 because of the above mentioned; there are areas for you to improve and become the best Scottsdale has to offer. I hope you're listening."}
{"text":"We had a  really nice dinner here last night. The restaurant as a whole is really nice, well kept, and has a nice ambiance. The bar at the entrance is clean, well stocked, has a good bartender, and prices are reasonable.  The restaurant has a some really nice private dining options.   For couples, there are small 2 person booths that look out over the city, in a private area. They  have their backs to a hallway, curtains separate the booths themselves, and the view is fantastic.  For groups, their are options private dining rooms which look like they could seat 15+ people.  The general dining area is broken into balcony and indoor seating, both are spacious, and have a view of the open kitchen, something I like.  There is also a bar in the main dining area which looks over the kitchen, which is pretty cool.  The service was very good, and even while our waitress was busy, others came by to ensure we were taken care of.  We ordered their small seafood platter as an appetizer, which included King Crab, Muscles, Shrimp, and Oysters. All of it tasted fresh and was great. Their cocktail sauce is also fantastic.   For  dinner, I had the 17oz sirloin, ordered medium-rare. We also shared sides of their smashed potatoes and cauliflower gratin.  The steak was seasoned well, and cooked perfectly. The sides were also excellent. I  also was lucky enough to try the Scallops as one of my dinner mates had ordered them, they were velvety soft and delicious.  I thought the pricing to be really fair, even cheap, compared to what I expected and what I got. It was a very good experience overall, and I will return."}
{"text":"Great ambience and service, romantic ambience and views. The private booth adds to the experience. They gave us complimentary flour-less chocolate cake for our anniversary which was great.  Over all glad we came here! Maggie was a great server and knowledgable of the menu."}
{"text":"Short and sweet  The place is beautiful The seating is well spaced and placed  Great service Amazing view Food was good.  I was expecting great Prices are commiserate with the atmosphere Had the rib eye;  cooked perfectly. Medium + Husband had NY strip.  Said it was great.  Other guest had jalape√±o bacon wrapped shrimp and scallops,  said they were really good,  a fraction dry Where they get lousy marks is on the side dishes Faro and mushroom side dish, blah and weird and we do love grains Corn with kale,  weird and not appealing Whipped potatos. Boring Bread basket was average Nosh board platter with fondue was ok. The pickled vegetables just didn't mesh with hot cheese fondue.  Sliced meats were good,  the medjool dates were amazing and the best part Received a complimentary dessert due to it being a special occasion,  mediocre chocolate flour less torte Would not go here again for dinner; would go have drinks,  walk around and listen to the live piano player.  Did I mention the million dollar views?"}
{"text":"Wonderful place for a romantic dinner or a night out to feel fancy. Been to this place high in the sky three times and all had a wonderful experience! Food was tasteful and great selection of wine. Will be back again whenever a special occasion comes up!"}
{"text":"I guess third time is a charm.  I've been here before a couple times and didn't think they were anywhere close to the same level as Mastros or Dominicks I will say the last time was really good. Food on point and service was great.  17 oz Ribeye was perfect."}
{"text":"Ah, the casino and the restaurants within it. There are folks from all walks of life trying to make it big and get lucky. Those who don't (and the few that do), settle for a delicious meal at this establishment. Located at the very top of the talking stick resort, it is somewhat of a contrasting environment. On one hand, there is extremely expensive food and a top notch view. At the same time, you have folks dressed in country clothing, others in suits and others just in tshirts. It is a very confusing vibe and frankly, not much different from the casino itself. Just be ready for some people watching.   Ron Dimas, the chef here, aspires to keep the heritage of a restaurant in a Native American casino and has a few dishes inspired by Native American cuisine. Started off the meal with a very good soup, part minestrone, part their own creation, it was extremely delicious. It wasn't just some \"cream of ...\" soup, but had lots of vegetables and a spectacular broth. Continued with the main course of wild boar tenderloin, which was dry and did not have much of that delicious boar taste to it. I suspect they must have marinated it quite a bit to get the gaminess out or it was frozen, which is too bad. I do respect that some people may like having less gamey taste and the chef is catering to that. Onions served with the boar were completely burned unfortunately. Then, there was a side of ricotta ravioli or another pasta, can't recall which, but it was delicious. Finished it off with a dessert special of the day, which was unfortunately oversweetened. There were complimentary house made chocolates provided and you can't complain about free stuff, but they were mostly sugar and little taste to them.   The view of course makes this place the spot to be. For a one time visit, I would recommend making a visit. The water feature on the rooftop is very cool and makes photography easy. Our waiter (I believe Brandon) was spectacular, very kind and attentive. The food overall was good, with some highlights and some disappointments. Overall, enjoyed the meal, but not quite sure if I'd come back given the very steep price tag and a mixed experience. Despite some dishes being delicious, others left me wondering why."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've taken my girlfriend here before. But last night was a really special event - her birthday. I decided to get us a private booth this time, which has a $120 minimum spend, but most likely you'll end up doing that anyway. We starting out with the nosh board which was an assortment of meats, dates, and cheeses. She had the chicken, I had the sirloin steak and we both got the mashed potatoes. The chicken was savory and practically melts in your mouth. As for the steak, I've had a ton of steaks in my life but this was by far the best, I mean, it was so tender that I was literally able to cut the steak with a fork! The green chili mashed potatoes were off the hook, great flavor and a huge portion.   The service here is amazing. Our waitress was super friendly, and what I liked best is that she never over talked and almost floated in every time she stopped by to refill our champagne. Quickly in and then back out, so we never broke our conversation. After dinner we went to the patio and enjoyed a view of the city with the comfort of some heaters and even a fireplace.   I will be sure to revisit this place for any special occasion!!"}
{"text":"Can't say enough about the food, wait staff, manager, and  of course the view. What a way to spend our 46 Anniversary. Only been in Az. 3 years will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"The draw here is, of course, the view and the service. Probably the best ambiance in the city, and likewise the service is excellent. The food is also excellent, but there are other restaurants around that are its equal or a little bit better. The wine cellar and barkeep are also talented (yummy.) All things considered this is a place for that special event (anniversary or birthday) or when you want be pampered in a very special place."}
{"text":"Oh your birthday is coming up?  Or is it your anniversary?  Or are you just dead inside and need $300 meals to feel just a bit alive?  Whatever the case you're making the right move going to Orange Sky.    The food is as good as the views and the service is top-notch.  As far as value is concerned, there isn't much but the wine list is definitely reasonable.    The meal is comparable to any of the dozens of high end steak places you'll find at ground level in Scottsdale but the setting makes this a much better choice for a special event.  Or a regular Tuesday dinner Mr. Rockefeller."}
{"text":"Gorgeous view, wonderful service, incredible food."}
{"text":"Wonderful dining experience. Food was 5 star and service impeccable. Views of the surrounding area from the top of talking stick were phenomenal."}
{"text":"Ate here April 23 for dinner with friends and had a wonderful meal. Kyle was our server who did a very good job. Food served at our table were tenderloin steak, ribeye, and shrimp / scallops steaks. All were correctly cooked and delicious. Side dishes were very good. Views are excellent as well. We will be returning!"}
{"text":"Service was incredible!!!! The views from the balcony simply amazing!!! We ate here for our wedding anniversary and so glad we did!! The steak was great and the sides were scrumptious!!! Our waiter was very nice and he was thorough!!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our time at the Orange Sky on Thursday 10/16/14.  The staff starting with the young woman at the elevator to the person who cleared our plates were very friendly and professional.  The view was beautiful.  I noticed that some of the arm chairs were a little overly worn out.  I think they should get some love and attention.  Our server was Teresa and she was great.  I thought the salmon could have been grilled slightly longer but I am not a connoisseur nor a chef but the presentation was lovely.  My side was a little disappointing because there was a flavor in the red potato dish that overwhelmed.  I am picky but my friend whose birthday it was completely enjoyed the generous serving of perfectly cooked calamari, the shrimp dish and his side of gnocchi.  They brought him a delightful and beautifully presented chocolate mousse crunch for his birthday.  I want the dessert chef's writing ability in chocolate!  It was wonderful experience and I would venture there again during the week."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful and worthy concept restaurant. The views are spectacular, service is top notch and food is amazing.  So, why only 4 stars? My wife made reservations on the Orange Sky web site for an early seating, requesting a western view to view the sunset (hence the name Orange Sky). When the restaurant called a couple days before our dining reservation, she was told we'd be sitting in a location with a partial view of the west, but mostly of the McDowell Mountains to the east and the golf course. She again asked the caller from Orange Sky to do what she could to get us a better view. After reading a few reviews, it became apparent to us the online reservation system does not necessarily ensure preferred seating. I called back to get the view we wanted and lo, there was availability. Annoying to say the least. If they get this squared away, the place could reach 5-star status.  The service and food was exceptional. I had the veal chop which was delicious. My wife had their NY Strip and it too was prepared excellently. Everything that came from the kitchen was beautiful in presentation and delicious on the palate. The wine list was going through some changes as the new Sommelier, Wednesday, was working on some new features. The list is quite nice, showcasing several decent value wines as well as the obligatory over the top Ch. Haut-Brion & Ch. Petrus. Both of these are available for stupid money.  I would return to OS, for the food, service and view again. It is certainly worth the price of admission in our opinion."}
{"text":"A perfect anniversary dinner thanks to Krystal our amazing server and every other staff member we encountered, the excellent food and stunning sunset views ."}
{"text":"I'm not the type to complain or be vocal about bad experiences, but I really feel the need to write a review after my very negative experience at Orange Sky last night.   It was early Sunday afternoon and I had called 3 times to make a reservation for the restaurant after hearing great things about it. The first two times my call went directly to a voicemail asking me to leave a message with my desired reservation time and that someone would get back to me. As I was uninterested in leaving a message, I called back again and my call was answered by someone. I made a reservation for two people at 7:45pm that night (Sunday) and we planned on arriving a few minutes early to grab a cocktail in the lounge while the sun was setting.   We arrived quite early (around 6:45pm) and let the hostess know that we were there and would grab a drink while waiting for our table. We mentioned that we'd love to be seated early, if possible, and we were told that \"it should be about that time\" (7:45pm) when our table would be ready. We understood, since it was Arizona Restaurant Week and we assumed the restaurant was incredibly busy (you aren't able to see the restaurant from the lounge area, so we couldn't tell).   We went to grab a drink at the bar and unfortunately, the bartender either was not behind the bar or had his back to us. After about 15 minutes, we were able to get a drink and have a seat. We relaxed for quite some time and later learned that it was the bartender's first night - understandable, but should have a bit more training as to not ignore customers when there are only about 4 people sitting at the bar. We went to sit outside on a small balcony right off the lounge.  At around 7:40pm, we started to get antsy and went inside to check on our spot and let them know that we had been on the balcony in case they missed us. We told them \"we were out on the patio and just wanted to make sure you knew we hadn't left\" since no one had said a word to us since we had been there. The hostess' response was, \"We're waiting on our servers to catch up. You'd like to sit on the patio?\" We replied, \"We'd be happy to sit on the restaurant patio, however, we'd like to be seated inside or out - whichever was first available.\" She replied, \"Oh. I'll keep that in mind.\"  We were confused as to what just happened and thanked her although we felt she was giving us an attitude and sat back down.   At 8:15pm, when we still had not been seated or even approached by the hostess even though our reservation had been 30-minutes prior, we debated just leaving. We agreed that we'd give it 2 more minutes and we would cancel our reservation and head somewhere we knew we'd get good service. Just a moment after that, someone came up to us to tell us that our table was ready. However, we didn't receive an apology or anything. We definitely expected more from a restaurant that was so highly rated.  We were then walked back, through the velvet roped entrance, to the dining room. I must say, the space is absolutely gorgeous. Definitely a winner in the ambiance department. However, we were absolutely stunned when we arrived in the dining room and it was quite empty. There weren't many seated tables at all - which made us disappointed that we waited so long to be seated.... definitely a sign that they were understaffed.  We were seated at a booth inside, and waited for our server. And waited. After about 15 minutes of waiting, our server finally came by to get our drinks. We had decided to take part in the Restaurant Week Menu and were asked to put our entire order - drinks, meal and dessert - in all at once. We obliged, and waited. We weren't served our first course until 9:15pm.   When it arrived, we were definitely underwhelmed. The salmon was over-seasoned and overcooked. The soup was marginal, and the potatoes were hard. One thing that was great was the steak - although it was very small, it was cooked perfectly and seasoned just right. Unfortunately, our server didn't come back at all throughout our meal to check on us until we were just about through and she swooped our plate away from us without asking if we were finished.   Also, the women's restroom was dirty and there were paper towels all over the floor. Definitely not something I expected.   For spending over $160 on the meal and drinks for two, the service was unacceptable and the food was just okay. Overall, the experience we had was only a 2 out of 5. And it would be a 1 if the ambiance and view weren't as good.   I hate writing negative reviews, but Orange Sky should make an effort to work on their customer service. Once that is fixed, I'm sure it will be a great spot for a special occasion."}
{"text":"The food was excellent, intriguing menu, and very nice wine list which has something for everyone, but we felt that this high end restaurant could improve the atmosphere if they implemented a dress code. This is an elegant fine dining establishment, but people were there in flip flops, running shoes, casual shorts, wornout jeans, tee shirts, etc...this brought down the whole experience that such a restaurant should be able to command. It takes several weeks to get a reservation, especially for a table with a western view which has a $200 per table minimum, so they should require collar shirts, no flip flops, and the like, i.e. business casual minimum. Having the guests dress up for dinner creates a classy atmosphere which leads to a pleasing diningexperience. When people wear their better attire, they reflect a different demeanor, this change would create a positive elegant atmosphere throughout the restaurant."}
{"text":"Highlight of the trip was dinner with Elyssa at Orange Sky. Exceptional service. She took care of every detail seamlessly- with humor and discretion. Came back a second night, specifically in her section to have a second night of tlc. The food was good. The ambiance was fantastic. The view amazing. The service was stellar."}
{"text":"Attentiveness of staff is definitely a 5 star.  Food is probably a 3 star.   Atmosphere sphere a 5 star."}
{"text":"The place is beautiful and the food was awesome Had a perfect night at the place Time flies when you have good wine and food Looking at the sunset was speechless"}
{"text":"Good food, great service and fantastic ambiance. You'll like it, especially if you're there before the sun goes down."}
{"text":"Four of us for dinner, We had 2 Veal Rib Chops (Chili Citrus Basted), Georges Bank Diver Scallops with Brown Butter Caper Vinaigrette and 17oz. Rib Eye Steak with Yellow  Tomato Horseradish Cream. Crushed Potatoes, (Sherry Vinegar, Pancetta and Parmesan) & (Gnocchi, Black Truffle, Sunchokes, and Chipollini) for sides. All of the above came out great, very tasty, not what I expected from a Casino. The Desserts, while great looking lacked flavor and finish. Coffee was a little on the week side also.   Service was a little hard, our server was almost annoying. Way too intrusive. If not for the server and dessert. Orange Sky would have gotten 5 stars."}
{"text":"So I came here to see the sunset being as how it's the 'best' sunset view in Scottsdale, or so I heard.  My friend and I get on the elevator and we were asked if we had reservations, no we did not.  We stated we simply wanted to grab a drink and watch the sunset.  We were told by the snippy little elevator worker that \"it was at capacity\".  He then said he'd take us on a ride to the top and we could briefly peek out the elevator door.  My friend and I kind of rolled our eyes at each other and played along.  We get to the top and the damn lounge area was wide open.  What is capacity?  To have half of your seats empty?  We promptly walked out of the elevator and were told by the obnoxious elevator guy that because it was 'at capacity' we couldn't get out.    We ignored him and walked up to the bar and ordered drinks.  We then walked right up to empty chairs BY THE WINDOW FACING SUNSET and relaxed.    So while the lounge is gorgeous and the views of sunset are spectacular.... how about you get off your high horse Mr Elevator Director and chill out?  The lounge was in no way crowded, at capacity, or anywhere near. There were empty seats everywhere.   It's laughable, but seriously..."}
{"text":"Food pow!! Great atmosphere. Views can't be beat. Take some time and hang out by the water on the balcony."}
{"text":"We went on a whim when we were gambling and were not disappointed. One complaint I have is that the host at bottom and top of elevator could have probably seated us sooner. Had to wait for twenty or thirty mins an when we got to dining room it wasn't even packed. But once we were seated it was amazing. Food is pricey but totally worth it. All the sides were good and my veal was cooked perfectly. Service was great Dining room seemed a lil stuffy but our server Amy, picked up on our vibe and we had a lot of fun."}
{"text":"I received a call from the food and beverage manager after my previous review and experience at orange sky. He offered us a 200 credit to return to orange sky and give them another shot. This time around the food, view, service and overall experience was much better. I would definitely recommend making reservations in advance to get a private booth overlooking camelback mountain. We will be back to visit orange sky in the future."}
{"text":"Great service Steller views Good food  Had a lovely dinner here.  Service is excellent.  Food is mostly good. Sampled a few things on menu and found most of the food undersalted.  That was easily remedied...although would be nice to have some salt on the table.  The scallops and king crab entrees were outstanding...some of the best prepared I have had.  Very fresh seafood and not overly fussed with so the quality shines through!   The king crab was shelled which was an added treat for me.   There is also an extensive wine menu to choose from."}
{"text":"I visited Orange Sky at Talking Stick before a concert. I did not have reservations which I highly recommend. The staff did after all do their best and got us a table with very little wait time. The table we sat at was in the middle of the room. The view is spectacular, wish I had a seat closer to a window. The wait staffs knowledge of the menu and their suggestions made our dining experience great. From the appetizer to the main course the food was cooked to perfection and it was delicious. My only wish is that they had a different dessert menu. Everything was chocolate ( which I can't eat) or ice cream. I was hoping unique dessert. Everything is 5 star and to offer a dish if ice cream just turned off the experience. I definitely give the meal five stars because who needs dessert anyways!   Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Went there for brunch...enjoyed the views, the food, and the attempt of the servers to be \"fancy.\"  Did not get a chance to dine in one of the window side private tables which looked super cool and did not get to enjoy the main bar as you walk in which the decor in the entire place is extremely well done.  The no hat, no flip flops, and something else always bugs....another been there done that...I can only imagine that you could throw one heck of a party there....worth checking out but doubt I will be back."}
{"text":"Amazing food amazing view. Book in advance before you go and the bar closes at 12 midnight"}
{"text":"Great food and awesome views. Since there are no prices listed on online, I will try to help. We arrived early to have a drink prior to dinner. Drinks and wines by the glass are about $15 each. We were then escorted to our table/ booth that looked west as the sun was setting. Great views!! For dinner, we started with burrata and pest that was amazing. Prices of appetizers and salads were about $10-15 each. Entrees start at $30 for scallops and fish, scallops were the best I have ever had. Steaks are priced starting at $33 for small filet, $38 for rib eye and $40 for a kobe flat iron, there were others but i cannot recall. My husband ordered a regular filet that was $40 and perfectly cooked. We did not order dessert , so I am not sure what was on that menu. We will definitely be back. There is also a great outdoor patio with a negative edge fountain off the dining room."}
{"text":"I had huge expectations for this place so I booked a reservation in advanced for our 3 year anniversary. Unfortunately the experience was not up to par.  The hostess was late seating us for the sunset dinner we planned, then we did not receive the correct booth as requested and reserved.  They moved us to a booth with  no view!  The manager and the server did make up for the rudeness and the mishap but enough to make us come back.  The food was good but very overpriced.  We were very disappointed, the managerial team seemed very unorganized. I hope they improve these areas."}
{"text":"9/26/10  I am overjoyed w/ my decision to have dinner here on the last night of Restaurant Week despite three days' of failed attempts to get out of work early enough to enjoy the sunset views!  The terrific value on such a delicious meal coupled w/ a great perlustration of the eternity pool/fountain in the patio deck made up for the missed survey of the desert mountain landscape (don't forget the beautiful Talking Stick golf course, resort pools, and water fixtures!).  Besides the two restaurant lounge areas, private dining booths, two Chef's tables ($2000 minimum ticket), and a large, yet intimate, main dining area, there are many \"pockets\" brimming w/ positive energy in the patio where one can enjoy a cocktail (or not!), catch up w/ friends, or just linger and take in the beauty of the space.  Before or after dinner, you can also enjoy a bit of live music (tonight featured a pianist)-- loved the aeronautic-themed chairs!    Enough on the atmosphere, let's get onto the food!  For Restaurant Week, Orange Sky's $39 menu featured:  APPETIZER: Lobster bisque; Half-dozen of iced oysters; OS dinner salad. MAIN COURSE: Filet of beef; Grilled half-chicken; Herb-crusted Pacific yellowtail tuna. DESSERT: Chocolate dome; Lemon semolina cake; Choice of gelato or  sorbet.  If I didn't have food allergies to worry about, I would've chosen the oysters to start; the tuna for the main, and the lemon cake to finish.  Instead, I ordered the salad, the filet, and the crowd-pleaser chocolate dome, and what a wonderful meal they made!!  The salad was comprised of greens and spicy candied walnuts dressed in a roquefort-sherry vinaigrette, and sprinkled w/ a few dashes of toasted shallot ribbons.  The sherry vinaigrette gave the salad a lovely, smooth, and mild flavor.  That is, until I'd bite into a roquefort crumble, which lent a welcomed burst of tang and pungency!  The combination of candied walnuts, roquefort, sherry, and shallots might not be for everybody, but I loved it- a great way to stir up my appetite!  The twin tournedos of beef filet were truly remarkable!  Cooked to medium, the filet was lovely to behold, and even more delightful to eat- the sauce choron, a bearnaise variation, that supplemented the dish made for a perfect pairing!  The steaks also came w/ two roasted sweet peppers, a few asparagus spears (a few I found were slightly overdone, but still very good), and silky mashed potatoes.  (I personally like a bit of texture in mashed potatoes, so I was very happy to find that this specimen wasn't TOO silky.  Alone, it was a tasty side, but after tasting the meat, the potatoes could've used a bit more seasoning.  However, I feel it's better to have to add more seasoning after than to have too much and not be able to enjoy a dish at all!)  I really appreciated that the steaks were presented twin-style instead of one whole-- I was able to enjoy a small serving and still have some room for dessert!  And oh, what a great dessert I had!  Drum roll please... The chocolate dome, made in-house, presented w/ two blackberries and a glaze of white chocolate and bitter orange.  The dome itself was a \"hard shell\"  of chocolate ganache (it really wasn't hard at all, and I personally would've appreciated the \"break\" of a chocolate bar here), sprinkled w/ almond brittle, and inside lay exquisite mantles of chocolate mousse and chocolate cake, which sat on top of a chocolate cookie!  While the dessert looked very rich and decadent, it was surprisingly light (I had three glorious bites before putting it aside to move onto the gelato).  I definitely wanted to take some of this cake to enjoy later at home ;)  The gelato, while not made in-house (or so the server believed), was equally satisfying- the coffee flavor was quite delicate-- this was a scoop to be savored ever-so-slowly, like a favorite spirit to be sipped over time, and not chased down.  I also had a cup of Peet's coffee to go along w/ dessert.  I waited a very long time to experience Orange Sky, and what a remarkable evening I had!  I will be back very, very soon!  p.s.  Small details, such as pretty dinnerware and embedded crystals in silverware (although I noted fingerprint smudges all over- tsk, tsk!), friendly and courteous service, and the lovely upgrades to the fixtures and decor really added to my overall satisfaction w/ my OS experience.  I would suggest everyone try Orange Sky at least once, but make sure you arrange yours w/ a sunset reservation!  (Unless, of course, you quite enjoy looking at the tops of brightly lit parking lots!)  p.p.s  Recall those private dining booths I mentioned?  They're certainly worth checking out if you value some privacy-- the tables all face panoramic views and certainly keep prying eyes from seeing who are seated.  [The only giveaway to the tables' occupancy was the pockets of barely discernible conversation my ears picked up as I walked by.  Visual inspection of the tables would have you believe that the booths were empty."}
{"text":"My family and I went to Orange Sky on Easter. We have 2 kids and we brought my husbands brother and wife, along with my mother. They make AWESOME steak! And you know how kids are picky, especially my daughter, and even she liked it! Oh god it's so delicious I would do anything to go back there, it's like a luxury restaraunt. I think we are for sure coming back for Easter!"}
{"text":"You come here to impress your date with the view, the private booths facing the windows are nothing short of awesome.  The food is as pricey as to be expected but it was very good, service is top notch also.  We started with salad, then I had the ribeye and it rocked!  My wife had the crab legs that were already de-shelled, that rocked!  We also got the ah-gratin style potatoes that were slightly undercooked so they were not that great and we got the creme brulee but it came out cold, probably because it was Valentines Day.  I am not sure that I would rush back since I do not drop that kind of coin often and it was a bit of a drive.  I am glad that we have a nice casino style resort in Phoenix now but they need to deal with the casino floor, it smells way to strong with smoke."}
{"text":"So my wife told me that I can pick any restaurant that I want to go to for my birthday so I chose you Orange sky! I expected to have at least a little view but my booth was facing the bar and I couldn't see the outside. I feel like this is important to know when I made my reservation that I would not have a view at all. The food and service were very good the only thing I wish would happen is a manager would double check on our table to make sure we are enjoying are experience especially after the hostess sat us and I wasn't happy with the seat. Being in the restaurant business for 15+ years it's these small things that you remember."}
{"text":"Ambience and view is amazing. Food is delicious. My only drawback would be that it was a tad expensive. But service was excellent, view and the overall experience is worth checking out!"}
{"text":"I'm not impressed! We had high hopes for this place. We had stopped at topgolf and decided a nice dessert and drinks would be perfect to close out the night. We had arrived at Orange Sky and asked the hostess where the best seating is for a view. She suggested the dining room instead of the lounge. We had explained that we wanted just desserts and drinks. She led us to the dinning area. We told her once more that we didn't want a full course meal and she walked us back to the lounge area. Really annoying!! Why won't you accommodate your patrons that wants to enjoy dessert with a nice view??   We decided to still sit at the lounge. Our waitress grabbed is the wrong menu. And took awhile to come back to check on us for our orders. By that time we were so turned off that we left."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar & had a light dinner (okay, two glasses of wine & a salad, really). The bartender was super nice and took care of me.   I had the roasted beet salad which was fab. Small but full of flavor - fennel, beets, pears, and cheese crumbles. Can't remember for certain but think it was blue cheese. My only suggestion would be to do fewer pear chunks and more beets.   I chatted with a diner next to me. He got the roasted chicken. Again not a huge entree but he said it was yummy."}
{"text":"Came here with a party of 15, our waiter and waitress were so lovely and very kind. The selection of drinks were nice. I had 2 glasses of moscato and I also ordered the scallops since it seemed like a popular choice on Yelp. I personally didn't like them. My sister, on the other hand loved them.  I think it's probably because I am used to eating scallops a different way.  We we ordered sides for the entire party. My favorite were the smash potatoes; the asparagus were good as well. I do plan to go back and order salmon instead. I'm not much of a steak person. The birthday dessert was delicious. The restaurant itself it's very veryyy beautiful our reservation was at 8:00pm so we had a roof of stars at the patio. Even from inside we had beautiful views. It's definitely a place I recommend. I rate it a 4 stars due to the cleanness, friendliness, stunning views, great drinks, great sides, my sister loved the scallops, and I didn't.  I plan to give it another chance and give it the last star it deserves."}
{"text":"Can a server influence your dining experience? You bet! Not only influence but completely make and enhance? Yes, if you eat at this amazing restaurant ask for Liv!  We took some friends who were visiting from San Francisco to dinner there.   We went with intentions of sharing a beautiful Arizona sunset with them but unfortunately it was oddly pouring rain and dark sky rather than Orange Sky.  Our server (Liv)was so amazing she quickly erased any disappointement we may have walked in with.  She was informative, knowledgeable and precise.  The food was amazing (for something different try the grilled"}
{"text":"We tried the oysters, beef cheeks with bone marrow, ribeye, wagyu steak, green chili mashed potatoes, crushed potatoes with pancetta and the mousse dome.  The beef cheeks with marrow were delicious! The oysters were pretty tiny. Steaks were seasoned very well. The view was nice but it does depend on which booth you get. Also, even though it may seem private you are divided by a curtain so you can hear the conversations next to you pretty clearly. We ordered the mousse to go which did not hold up well, we wish the server would have mentioned this to us when we ordered it to take with us."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant specifically for the private tables and sunset views. Requested such a table when I made the reservation, as it was a special event - my husband's 40th birthday! We were hoping to have a nice, romantic dinner. We don't get out for date nights much since we have two little kids at home.  I understand that not all requests can be accommodated, but I asked to be notified, in advance, if they couldn't make this happen.  No one called or emailed.   Got to the restaurant and they seated us at a center table, far, far away from the window, in the noisy main dining room. Said that not only were the private booths taken, but the window tables in the main dining room were taken as well.  Made the reservation 3 weeks in advance, and then saw three tables empty while we were there! And one of the filled tables was a family with two little kids. They clearly made no effort to honor a special request on a special occasion.   Our waiter was very kind, so we ordered champagne and an appetizer. But we went somewhere else for dinner. I doubt we'll be back. Restaurant gets two stars only because of our waiter who was thoughtful, prompt and friendly, and did his best to make our experience pleasant despite our palpable disappointment."}
{"text":"I can't say enough amazing things about this restaurant, the service and most importantly the talent of chef Ron Diemas (hopefully I got that right). I was fortunate enough to be gifted with a Package won in a silent auction from the march of dimes. The package included a 2 night stay at the resort, a 90 minute couples massage and a $50 gift card. We figured we would book dinner at Orange Sky and use the gift card toward the dinner. When we showed up they informed us that we would be having a one of a kind, off menu experience as part of our package. It turned out to be a 7 course meal paired with wine at each course. We are adventurous and love to try new things, so we were super excited. Each course was better than the next. The wine was beautifully paired.  Above all, the food was outstanding. I have eaten at a lot of ravely reviewed restaurants and I would have to say, this was the BEST meal I have ever eaten. Complements to the chef!! A big thank you to our server (Wes...I think?.....you gave us a LOT of wine) and a thank you to Orange sky/ the talking stick for supporting the March of Dimes by offering such an amazing package. Also, I have to thank the best CPA ever, Jim Laubham (capital accounting Ahwatukee), for this amazing gift. If you win it again next year, I highly recommend you keep it for yourself!"}
{"text":"Bradford was amazing!!! He knows his menu. He suggested things and was spot on!!!  Thank you Bradford!!!"}
{"text":"I had family in town and brought them to Orange Sky for dinner and we had an amazing experience. The food was excellent and the atmosphere was ideal for a relaxing evening to catch up. Our server Demetrio was so kind and insightful, he made our dining experience one to remember."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a great experience with great food. But, the the topper was out sweet, most accommodating waitress, Olivia. She MADE our experience.:-)"}
{"text":"We had an awesome experience! Visited the 15th floor at sunset on a Sunday evening for our anniversary. The views, ambiance, food and service were all exceptional. We can't wait to return and it made my lovely bride very, very happy!  Mike P. Fountain Hills, Az."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located on the 15th floor of the casino. There is a dress code warning including no flip flops, t-shirts, shorts or cut offs which helps to keep the casino riff raff out.  There are glass widows lining the restaurant  with tables and booths placed all around them. The mountain and desert views are spectacular and the overall ambiance is classy and captivating.   The food was excellent although a bit overpriced. I had the tenderloin flatbread , the steak was tender and juicy and had the perfect amount of rosemary. The Tuscan kale salad and the fried green tomatoes were also delicious choices prepared with care. I agree with another reviewer who said the wine list pricing was all over the place, luckily the selection made up for the scattered pricing. The bartender we had was personable and friendly and made our visit quite enjoyable.  Overall I don't think I would make dinner reservations here, but it is a nice place to grab an app and a glass of wine and take in the stunning views of our beautiful desert city."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants here.  Simply amazing views.  I love the steak filet medallions.  Amaze!  I don't usually have steak sauce, but they make their own and it is delicious.  I tried it once and was hooked.  Great sides and great service!  The only issues I've ever had there was the dumb Manager at the TSR hotel didn't release my credit card to the room, so after dinner I had to go all the way downstairs and tell her YES they can use my card on the room, which we had done already at registration.  Her name was Gina, but we called Gyna because she was so unprofessional.  I was there with my Bestie."}
{"text":"My parents and I came here for Christmas dinner and had a private booth. Julio was our waiter and was very attentive. The file mignon was fantastic as was the wine selection."}
{"text":"1 hiccup lastnight, there was some question about who our server was. We waited about 20 mins and someone finally came over. It's the holidays so we get it.  The food was amazing as always!"}
{"text":"Wonderful birthday dinner at Orange Sky!  First we were called in the afternoon to let us know of a cancellation and that we could have a private booth.  Upon entering we were taken to our special booth and the view and ambiance were perfect.  Our server Tracey was perfect!  She was cordial, professional, helpful and charming.  Thank you!  Dinner and wine selection was top notch.  They oysters are delicious and our entrees, crab legs and sea bass were equally great as well.    Expect to spend close to $200 but honestly between the food, the service and the privacy it is worth every penny.  It was a special night, thanks!"}
{"text":"Birthday party of Nine! The place is a enormous with nicely decorated of modernization. The view of sunset is particularly spectacular. Conceptually, if everyone (table) has this view, then it would a much more desirable. Services was a little off (too many people with badges around but seem like they have different 'functions' other then what we needed for patio service), while we waited for our table (a nearly 2 hours wait), hanging out at the open patio - the ambience is my favorite part. Food is mediocre, as steaks were over-cooked (say 4 dishes out of 4...or perhaps, I shouldn't be making comparison to Donavan's). Wine list is massive! Prices started at premiums $50 a drinkable bottle...Hope you cashed in your chips richly from downstairs."}
{"text":"My boyfriend surprised me on my birthday with dinner at Orange Sky.  What an awesome place!  We got there early to watch the sunset from the outside area.  It was breathtaking.  Because it was my birthday, they seated us in on of the private booths, even though he had not requested it.  That was definitely a nice touch, as we were able to watch the end of the sunset from the comfort of our private table.  Our food was delicious.  We had soup that was fantastic, although I don't remember what kind because this was a couple of months ago.  Then, for our entrees we shared the crab legs and some sort of steak.  The steak was good, but the crab was INCREDIBLE!  It was already shelled, so we didn't have to go to any trouble and were just able to enjoy it.  Then, they brought us a free dessert for my birthday, but I'm not really a dessert person, so I don't remember what it was.   ** One tiny little complaint-- a few months earlier my bf and I had been at the casino and just wanted to go up and look at the view.  They would not allow us to go up because my bf was wearing flip-flops.  I think that's kind of ridiculous in AZ, but, oh well, just be sure to dress to impress when you go there."}
{"text":"You need to get hooked up with a concierge his name is John DeMoss  he really rocks this  place, go talk to him and he will show you the way.   Call him first for special 480  850 4062.    Thank you, John, for the great service!!!     Great job to Nick at the Orange Sky lounge."}
{"text":"Saturday night was a milestone birthday that we chose to celebrate at TSR.  We were pretty excited about dinner at Orange Sky.  Some of that excitement was justified - some was not.  Upon arrival for our 5:00 p.m. sunset dining with a private booth reservation, we were asked to wait in the bar while they got ready for us.  We ordered drinks and waited and waited while others were seated -even after we asked twice it was probably 30 minutes after our reservation time before we were seated and missed the majority of the sunset.  The piano music while we waiting sounded recorded.  The waiter and bus boy were not the level of professionals you would expect for the restaurant.  Nice but goofy.  The private dining booth was wonderful.  Now on to the food.  Oysters great.  Son-In-Law's Rib Eye Steak - wonderful.  My pre-cracked crab wonderful.  My daughter's scallops - disappointing to her to get only 4 scallops on her plate.  Mashed potatoes OK.  Asparagus disappointing - tough.  Bread OK.  Huckleberry cobbler with vanilla ice cream - yummy.  The outdoor patio - breathtaking.  So C for service.  B for food.  A for ambiance."}
{"text":"The most disappointing dinner at a fine dining restaurant that I've ever had....EVER.  Where to begin...we were a party of 6 celebrating our son's first job after graduating from college.  We wanted a special restaurant and had heard great things about Orange Sky.  We arrived for our 7:45 reservation and were seated in the main dining room next to a party of 75-100 people who were enjoying their business dinner.  It was so loud, I couldn't believe that that the restaurant would not have made an effort to seat us somewhere else as it was a Sunday evening and aside from the huge, loud party there were few other guests.  We were there about 20 minutes when the manager came over and apologized for the noise.  She said they should be done pretty soon (no offer to move us, or buy us a cocktail or dessert).  Our waiter was polite, not super attentive.  Food was ok.  My scallops were cold in the middle.  Mashed potatoes were warm, not hot.  Some of the asparagus was tough. My son's GF had salmon which she took 2 bites of yet the waiter never asked if it was ok.  The assistant wait staff was shocking. We had ordered sides for the table and when they didn't all fit, they just stacked on top of each other (on the rims of the plates. I couldn't believe that in such an upscale restaurant how poorly trained they seemed.  Dessert was meh.  We spent $800 for this dismal experience.  I doubt Orange Sky reads these reviews, but they really should.  If I had known how bad this experience would be, we would have gone to Kai or Elements. Lots of great choices in the valley...Orange Sky is not one of them."}
{"text":"Thank you very much for the lovely evening. The lounge was amazing. Sad we couldn't have dinner there, but we will be back. Felicia Lee, Thank you for making a reservation for us & for being so nice. That personal touch meant a lot. Thank you for the Anniversary Dessert. I loved it. We will be back soon. It's tge most beautiful place in Phoenix. Well worth the money you spend. Romantic & Special. The best place for  Valentine's Day or just a Romantic date night."}
{"text":"The Thanksgiving prix fixe 4 course meal was one of the best meals I have ever had anywhere.  And I moved to Scottsdale 2+ years ago from one of those foodie Meccas, Austin, TX, home of Top Chef Paul Qui.  The first course, a Brussel sprout and hazelnut slaw, was outstanding.  The second course, a spicy shrimp and red quinoa dish that I thought had a touch of orange flavor, was also fabulous.  I liked that these first two courses were both super nutritious and insanely delicious.   The third course was prime rib or turkey.  The boys went with the prime rib with a mushroom grazy, mashed potatoes, and saut√©ed kale.  I went for the more traditional turkey, dressing, mashed potatoes, saut√©ed vegetables, and cranberry sauce.  The sugar snap peas were cooked to perfection, as were the other vegetables.  It was more than I could eat, but my son was happy to take the leftovers back to his dorm at ASU.  The dessert choices were limited and a trifle disappointing, but not enough to dampen my enthusiasm for all that had come in courses one through three.  We hope to make this a new family tradition and eat there every Thanksgiving.  I plan to eat there as often as I can.  While pricey, we basically got the meal of our lives for three adults for the same price one steak and a couple of sides would cost at qui in Austin.  The decor, ambiance, breathtaking views, and service were all that one could hope for.  Whoever their chef is, I think someone referred to him as Chef Ron; hang on to that guy!  We don't drink alcohol, so we cannot comment on the bar situation.  But we did eat at the bar and the service we received at the bar was outstanding."}
{"text":"I expected quite a bit more from this place.  Let's start by saying that the facilities are absolutely stunning.  You walk down a hallway that is lined with wine rooms and sommelier quarters and flanked by private booths with stunning views.  It opens to a huge white tablecloth dining room with incredible 180 degree views.  They absolutely have that right.  I had the braised porkshank.  It was very good.  It was not amazing and it was not the best that I have ever had but it was very good.  One member of our party had the lamb.  He said that it was just ok.  It looked great and the presentation was really executed well.  The other had a filet.  I am not a fan of filet but that being said it was still very good.  He also said that he enjoyed it.  I have to say that it was prepared perfectly.  I di did not try it but the quinoa was raved about by the others at the table.  I think they have it right.  A beautiful dining room.  Really good food...not the best...  Prices were reasonable for the quality and experience.  I was there on business and would return on my next trip.  Not being from the area, if someone else had a suggestion that they thought would be better I would pass on orange sky and try that new place."}
{"text":"First thought that comes up when I think of my recent visit to orange sky \"perfect\". I was taken here on a date and I was already having a great night. When we arrived we were 25 minutes early for our reservation and the staff was more then welcoming they got us in right away. The atmosphere is upscale but warm not to stiff, I enjoyed the food as well. I had a shredded asparagus salad and my date had a new york strip and all was amazing.. the view from the restaurant is beautiful . If I could make any suggestions it would only be to add more variety to the salads on the menu I only seen two salad options. Im not a meat or seafood hater but I do enjoy a fresh salad. I will definitely come back and recommend to others"}
{"text":"Poor experience...silly tour of \"this is the kind of private booth you COULD have if you paid more\" and unbearably snotty waiter when asked if we could move to outside patio seating as i wanted to get a nice seat for my wife's birthday celebration...tried to speak with manager, but she was too busy dealing with some other drama. Walked out. On a positive note that has nothing to do with the \"Orange\"...we walked right by the two lead singers of Air Supply as they were going to their table...Cheers !"}
{"text":"First of all the place is just beautiful, views are amazing. I recommend having a drink on the balcony and going else where for dinner. First of all the service is slowwwwwwww. Once the beautifully looking food arrived we starting eating. Three of us ordered steak, one ordered med, came out med rare, two ordered med rare, both came out med to med well. Halibut also came out over cooked. I would have loved to share this with the waitress, but after the food was dropped off she never came once to check on us. Will definitely not be back."}
{"text":"Great dinner! We were celebrating a big birthday and they made it very special with a special dessert and personal message. We sat on the west side and watched the beautiful sunset over Camel Back Mountain. It was a wonderful night!"}
{"text":"Had celebratory dinner here last night. We had one of the private booths. That is a fun experience however there is a minimum $200 charge for the table. The service is impeccable. You can't beat it! We found the appetizers to be great. Cheeseboard was great. He loved the soup.  Average bread. We both decided to have steaks and I'm sorry we didn't try something else. My husband had the ribeye and it was quite chewy. I had the market price Japanese steak. I honestly thought it was an average steak I couldn't even say that it was great in anyway. That steak cost me $60. I got caught up in the pitch of it being like Kobe beef. It was nowhere near Kobe beef. We told our waiter that my husband's steak I was chewy- nothing was done about that as far as they will throw in a dessert or discount the meal a little. We didn't even tell him how I felt about my steak. I didn't want to be that complaining customer that's not happy. We will give it a try again because the appetizers were great the views are great and the service is great! Oh and they did bring me a Happy Retirement complimentary dessert! Very yummy!"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place for a while. I waited for a day with clouds forecast to make the reservation(last minute). I made my reservation online and requested a West facing(sunset facing) table in the comment box. I got a call within a couple minutes telling me there was not a West facing table available but I could get a special private table with a $200 min. I opted for the best non minimum priced table. Upon arriving the same questions about a minimum table price were asked and we were informed that we were getting a nice table without the minimum price because we had not been there before.    Enough with the bad. I would give five stars for the experience after that point. We were seated at a nice table in the corner of the large dining room with a great view. Our server(David) was great. He made us comfortable, read the table well, and was able to describe and answer questions about the menu.    The Nosh platter for 2 with aged cheddar fondue was just slightly underwhelming.  We decided to split the elk loin with a mushroom tart side for two. I couldn't have been more pleased. I was told that the chef suggested at least medium rare on the elk but I was very hastily that i decided to go with rare. Perfectly rare and the best elk I have ever had.    It isn't cheap but the combination of food, service, and atmosphere is worth it. We went with a budget of $200 with tip and accomplished that with an appetizer platter, a shared meal, a shared side, 2 before dinner drinks, 2 glasses of wine with the meal, and we split a glass of porto with our decadent desert.   I want to do it again in one of the private couch booths with the $200 minimum."}
{"text":"Really great service.  Food was good, what you would hope from a restaurant of this caliber.  The down side:  large table of approx 12 people in main dining room, obviously over served, incredibly loud.  Inexcusable behaviors for other diners in this type of restaurant.  Additionally the open dining room room is adjacent to the bar.  There were several loud drunk patrons just feet from our table. Again not what one would normally expect in this type of restaurant.   Consider that this is in a casino and as such will be subject to a different clientele than most high end restaurants."}
{"text":"This review is kind of difficult for a couple of reasons. Nearly every high point was off set with a low point to balance it out.   First the ambiance and location (15th floor looking west) is stunning. On the other hand having to walk through the casino to get to the elevator to take you upstairs is quite the opposite. Additionally, while others have talked about how quite it is, rarely hearing anyone else, etc. this was not our experience. We heard people screaming/partying, conversations from both of the booths neighboring ours and the like - not terribly upsetting but not what we were expecting.  Lastly the view has you looking out over the parking lot... Would it have killed them in the planning stage to put the parking lot, garage in the field facing the opposite direction?  The food, oh the food. My fiancee and I seem to have a problem in Phoenix/ Scottsdale - we find many more places serve outstanding appetizers than do serve great entrees. Such was the case here. We had a great corn soup and a tasty salad. Both got us excited for our main course - mine a 17 oz. Rib Eye with garlic parmesan   fries, hers a filet served Oscar Style with white cheddar whipped potatoes. However, while the steaks were decent, we were expecting more than decent. When the plate is more than $40 a person I expect to be wowed. The fries on the side were so overpoweringly garlic they were inedible - even to the point that the swamp of garlic they were resting in threw off the whole course. The whipped potatoes were pretty good.   We had a bottle of wine to make certain we hit the minimum charge of $125 and were impressed with the selection.   The last point was a dessert they threw our way due to it being our anniversary which came out on a plate with \"Happy Anniversary\" written out in chocolate. It was a nice touch, as was the personal greeting wishing us a happy anniversary as soon as we were taken to our table. This is what saved it from a 2 star review.  Take Away: For the money you can find better steak in Scottsdale at a fairer price without having to drag yourself through a grungy, overcrowded casino."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for a belated Valentine's dinner.  It was our first time at Orange Sky but it had been on our bucket list for a while.  We were definitely not disappointed.  First of all the view from the outdoor patio is spectacular, overlooking the pool, golf course and Camelback Mountain.  The sunset was gorgeous that night, deserving of the name Orange Sky.  We each had a Caesar Salad to start.  My husband had the Salmon and I had the Skirt Steak and we both shared the Mushroom Tart as our side. Our server was Dimitri who was attentive but encouraged us to take our time and enjoy.  Everything was just perfect!  I highly recommend this restaurant as a \"Special Occasion\" date spot. Very impressive!"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful. This was a special Valentines Day surprise, and it was great to say the least. First, you are on the top floor of the hotel at the Talking Stick Resort. Suggestion: Request a window seat. Some prime locations ( facing west) have a minimum charge\" The east side is fine as well. There are many booths in the middle of the restaurant, but it doesn't seem like you get a good view of the area. As you walk in to the dining area, you pass the kitchen. It is quite a show. It is spotless from our view and the folks working there looked great. It is fun watching all the activity. Now to the good part. We had a wonderful waitress- Elyssa who made us feel like we were the ONLY customer she had. She was super. It is not inexpensive, and is alacarte. But for a special occasion--it is the place to go. They have some great items on the menu. A couple of items that stood out. The Caesar Salad. They prepare it a slightly different way. Delicious. I had the skirt steak and added the \" SHRIMP & SCALLOP STEAKS* (3) prawns and divers wrapped in jalapeno bacon.\" Wow. And a side dish I would recommend- are the \" Crushed potatoes\". Never saw them prepared that way before. Very good. With wine and desert a couple will get to around $200.00. Between the wonderful service ; the views; the food, I whole heatedly recommend the Orange Sky"}
{"text":"I'll make this short and sweet.  I went to Orange sky for my anniversary after reading all the great reviews. The staff was friendly and very inviting, the views were quite spectacular. I would recommend if you are going for a special occasion to ask for a private table. The food was spot on the waitress was very attentive and kept a smile on our faces all night. Special kudos to AMY for being a fantastic waitress."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants at Talking Stick great food great drinks and awesome service"}
{"text":"Just happen to be going for a show and decided to reserve table at Orange Sky.  I had been there several times before to sit in one of the private booths overlooking the city which I highly recommend especially for special occasions.  This time however ate out in main area...Christopher was our waiter and he did a great job serving us.  I usually have fish, but Christopher recommended the fillet and boy was I glad he did!!!  It was way better than the steak I had only a few weekends ago at Dominick's Steak house and about half the price.  This steak melt in your mouth...  I am a local Realtor in town and clients always ask me where to go...now I will replace Dominick's with Orange Sky.  Two thumbs up for Christopher as well, we will request  you in near future as I am already thinking about how good it was!!!"}
{"text":"Ooooooooh boy here we go.   This was a very rough night all around. I will start with the service. Our main server seemed to either be having a horrendously bad day or just genuinely did not care about his job. I am someone who tends to ask questions or for recommendations and I don't think I got an answer out of him that was more than four words and that was when I asked where the restroom is and he said \"It's over there bro\" and pointed. It felt as if we were a burden to him which is not a good feeling.   Moving on to the food. The kitchen also had a rough night.  Our starter was pretty good. It was some kind of a Bruschetta and it was very nice. No complaints there. My date had a salmon dish as an entree and when it came out it wasn't cooked evenly, one side was burned and the other side was almost raw which is kind of strange to me. My Rib-eye was requested rare and brought out well done. We let our server know that both our dishes were cooked incorrectly and he rolled his eyes and said \"Oh fine\" and snatched out plates and didn't return until they were made again. Mine came back cooked medium rare which is absolutely fine and my dates salmon was cooked much better. The server put the plates down and pretty much ran away before we could tell him if anything was wrong again.   After what can only be described as one of my most bizarre meals out I didn't feel like sticking around for dessert which is a shame because I was really wanting something sweet.   Overall. This was horrible for the kind of money that was spent. If I had gone through and booked a table at one of the windows I would have been livid.   The only reason this got two stars and not one was because the hostess at the front was exceptionally nice and apologetic. She offered to get a manger when we were leaving and I didn't want to stay around for anything more. Definitely not coming back to this."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful time! Excellent birthday celebration for our son and family. Orange sky made a delicious birthday cake as well! Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I am so sorry to say this but this might have been one of the worst rib eye steaks I have ever had.  I thought maybe it was me but the other person at the table who got the rib eye agreed.  Not only did I ask for it medium rare and it was definitely cooked all the way through but it was incredibly fatty.  Now I know rib eyes tend to have more fat than other slices but I had to really use my muscles to work out any edible meat in this 17 oz.  I shouldn't be able to eat 17 oz so I'm guessing from my plate at the end of the night I probably got 4 oz, if I'm lucky, out of it.  The view is amazing at this place and our waiter was really nice but considering the cost of this place, I wouldn't ever order a steak here again and it would have probably been the only reason I would have gone."}
{"text":"We went at 1045pm and miss the set view that is all the rave. So no Orange Sky for us. Just a view of dessert lights. The service as expected. The coward was underwhelming. It's a huge restaurant so even though there was probably a number of people there, it seem empty.    The decor was modern and yet classy. I love large windows.   The food was ok. The ice shellfish platter was fresh and delightful. But our main courses not so good. The Steak was so and so. The Halibut was plain. The side not so great.   Bottom line. To expensive for the food."}
{"text":"Have been here 3 times and the food, ambiance and service are top notch. The views from this 15th floor restaurant are spectacular. My favorite part of this restaurant are their private dining booths. These booths are walled off by curtains, Each has a bench seat with cushy pillows and a huge glass window with views of the sunset. I recommend going here for that special occasion or to just to spoil yourself with upscale quality dining."}
{"text":"This is an excellent restaurant. The wait staff is friendly, but very professional.  The ambience is lovely and the tables are quite far from each other which makes it easy to have a conversation. And, the food is delicious. It is expensive, but a great place for a special occasion or a date night."}
{"text":"Stick at the resort for a conference, which overall is ok, but those who I am with do not dine. After a week a little me time is ok.  A NY strip rear was perfect, seasoned lightly allowed the cow to shine through. The smashed potatoes were very good, Gold potatoes with parsnips and white beats, covered in cheese and chopped pork belly. So very good... And I don't even know how to describe the dessert.  I will take a page out of Kim Kardashian, OMG... It was so good.  I say at the bar and Kyle was the bar tender. A great job he did... Unfortunately he has to rotate out to the casino floor to work as well... A dedicated bar tender would be more fitting of this place. I would suggest Kyle for the position."}
{"text":"Very good choice for dinner... I enjoyed the New York steak and the suggested side dishes of the Brentwood corn (with the egg)  and the kale. I enjoyed the unique side dishes so much that I forgot about the steak in front of me. If you order a steak entree, ask for the sampler of different flavored sea salts.     I usually have leftovers from a steak dinner at a restaurant. There were no leftovers and that was not because of lack of serving size. The food was flavorful. I enjoyed the kale with shiitake mushrooms. The steak was served with a small Japanese pepper on the side. It was a fun and creative menu.  I would give the restaurant 5 stars if the bathroom didn't have such a tiny little trash can for such a large place that size ( the trash can was the size of my powder room trash can). There were disposable towels spilled all over the floor. Also, I felt like I was sitting way too close to the neighboring table. I could here everything the people seated next to me were saying and the couple was not speaking loudly at all.   I found it interesting that the restaurant's bathrooms had sharps needle disposal containers in the restrooms. I have never seen that in a restaurant before.  It was a great dining experience overall."}
{"text":"We were a little late arriving due to Valet parking being full and our table wasn't ready when we arrived, however, the rest of the evening was perfect.  The salmon was cooked to perfection and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a wonderful dinner last night, timing it so we could enjoy the Arizona sunset. We were not disappointed. Our server, Elyssa, was very knowledgeable and attentive. Enjoyed the meal from cocktails Manhattan , salad and fabulous king crab to dessert, frozen chocolate mousse. It was a wonderful experience, but would like to see the business casual dress code enforced with no shorts as it is a high end restaurant."}
{"text":"I took my fiance here to celebrate his birthday/Valentine's Day! From the time I made the call to make reservations to the time we arrived...AMAZING!!! I requested a special dessert and they obliged (German Chocolate cake). The private elevator that takes you the 15th floor was just the beginning of our special night. Everyone was courteous and greeted us as if we were the only people there. The service was spot on and the food was delicious (calamari,chopped salad, flank steak and wedge fries). The ambiance couldn't have been any more perfect. I reserved a private booth (highly recommend) with rose petals. The sheer curtains gave you a peek of the view and shortly before sunset the sheers were opened for a view that I can only describe as heavenly. They also have a balcony with seating which we plan to try in the near future. Our server, Lisa was AWESOME!!!! It's a little pricy but well worth it."}
{"text":"A bit over rated. Sure the view is spectacular but that's about it. We had reservations and still had to wait 20 minutes.  Our server didn't bring us enough cocktail menu (1) for a table of 9.  He came to take our order and didn't realize we were short on menus.   I know not everyone needs one but how about 2 or 3 menus, especially with the long list of special cocktails and wine, a girl's gotta read the list!  The timing of the ordering and drinks seemed to lag.  I've been to many fine dining establishments before and I get that things are staggered but the first girl got her drink 25 minutes before the last girl got hers.  The food was OK.  I ordered the filet \"Oscar style\" thinking it was only an extra $12-18 bucks for a lump of crab meat (along the lines of other high end steak houses), the kitchen gave me a King crab leg with a $29.00 adder on top of my steak.   It's definitely a place to impress or celebrate but if you are truly a foodie, I'd keep the cash and spend it elsewhere."}
{"text":"My husband and I were staying at Talking Stick for an early wedding anniversary celebration. We called Orange Sky Saturday at 4 and left a voice mail requesting a reservation that night between 7:30-8. Orange Sky opened at 5. Nobody ever called to confirm or deny availability. I called at 7 to check status. Spoke with Mirandee (sp?). She indicated they were full until 9. I asked why I hadn't been called. She stated that she was just now getting around to the voicemails. Makes no sense to me. No apologies. My review is based off their lack off customer service since we never made it in the door to taste their food."}
{"text":"The view and ambience alone are worth the trip to Orange Sky but our food was delicious as well.  We shared a grilled shrimp app that was great and they offered to add an extra shrimp so we would each have 2.  My husband ordered the elk tenderloin as recommended by our waiter and it was delicious and perfectly cooked. I had the shrimp scallop steak which is really a kind of shrimp wrapped with a scallop in jalape√±o bacon with an aioli. It was fantastic.  We shared a Panna cotta that was great as well."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying my boyfriend and I are young. It's sometimes difficult to get decent, quality service when we go places due to our age. This was absolutely not the case. Our server JULIO was attentive and so knowledgeable i couldn't have asked for anything better. From the beginning to the end the entire experience was so enjoyable. I would recommend this to anyone who is trying to make a memory or even trying to enjoy a DELICIOUS dinner (the food was phenomenal). Can not go wrong here!"}
{"text":"5 stars all the way. We had a private dining booth with an amazing view. Dinner was delicious. I had the shrimp and scallop steaks. Husband had the elk. Deserts were incredible. Service was top notch. Fine dining for sure. Perfect date night."}
{"text":"We weren't able to score a booth but the west facing table still had s great view. The food was fantastic and our server Amy went above and beyond to impress us. It worked! Will definitely go back soon!"}
{"text":"We went to the a orange Sky this evening and had our own private table facing the sunset. The entire experience was phenomenal! Nathan was our host, and he deserves a 20+! The Beef Tenderloin, the rib steak, and the Salmon filet were outstanding..... We will be returning soon, as we live nearby... Thanks"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Scottsdale. The private booths and the views of the city are breathtaking too. We loved the Alaskan King Crab Legs which are already removed from the shells for you and served in a huge heap. The Scallops and Oysters were top shelf. This is a romantic spot that requires you dressing up just a little. Pre-dinner try the bar, hit the Casino after dinner if you're feeling lucky."}
{"text":"Positive dining experience with a bit of difficulty on the lead up to it. Made a reservation one week in advance and received email confirmation. The day of dining, I noticed that ou reservation was changed somehow, by the restaurant, to the wrong time, date and number of diners. I don't know how or why this happened, but it took me several phone calls and much time to get it straightened out."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place because of the good reviews...I am very disappointed...I took my boyfriend here for our anniversary and we will not be returning.  Here are the things that went wrong:  - I made reservations for 8:15pm and we were not seated until past 9pm. - My boyfriend ordered a steak as medium, but it came out well done. - The dessert with the surprise anniversary message had my name misspelled...I called twice to make sure this was right!   Don't overpay for mediocre food and bad service!"}
{"text":"Had the ribeye on 4th of July.  Not at all worth the money.  Go to Ruth Chris, Mastro's, Donovan's, Flemings or even Outback.  You will be better off."}
{"text":"Best dinner experience I have EVER had. Not exaggerating. There was 10 of us and everything we ordered was unbelievably good. Our waitress, I wish I remembered her name, was awesome and views were unmatched."}
{"text":"The standout here is really the venue.  The views are incredible (hence the name).  Service is good and so is the food.  Pricing is fair for the overall value of the experience.  It is perhaps a perfect place for a few sophisticated cocktails in an incredible setting."}
{"text":"What an outstanding restaurant. The staff is amazing. The food is delicious and the ambience is outstanding. Fortunately we had a waiter after dinner that disappeared on us. All in all, we enjoyed our dinner, we enjoyed the sunset. Lovely place to dine for that special occasion. It was price but you are not only paying for a lovely dinner but the experience of watching the sunset over Camel Back Mountain."}
{"text":"I don't know what these people are talking about that say this place is overrated. It's INCREDIBLE.  Extensive wine selection and they serve red wine at the appropriate temperature. The sea bass was impeccable. The elk was amazing. The sides were creative and full of flavor. The scallops were delicious As well and a great add on. Appetizers weren't the best part of the meal. But the view.....Oh the view. Do NOT miss this restaurant! Don't be fooled that it's in the same building as a casino. This is a 5 star dining experience. Be sure to look up the sunset times and plan your meal around that. They have private booths and window seating. Ask for those!!!!"}
{"text":"What an amazing experience. We reserved one of the private tables. From the moment we walked in the customer service was amazing. Our server, Julio made it even more special. He was attentive but at the same time gave us the time to enjoy our experience. We were never rushed. The whole team was amazing. Our food was made to perfection and again thanks to Julio for his suggestions. At the end of the night he surprised us with a dessert plate wishing us a Happy Anniversary.  If you are wanting to find a romantic evening this is the place to go."}
{"text":"yay! my 100th review :) So glad its a 5 star.  Hubby surprised me with a night out- He heard from a little birdy (gf Heather) that I wanted to try Orange Sky. This experience is probably slightly biased in that I was completely smitten from being surprised with a nice dinner at a beautiful place... but here goes :)  The valet area at Talking Stick is nicely lit and busy, good energy there. When you go to the elevator lobby for the OS, there is a receptionist that checks your reservation before you go up to the 15th floor in a glass elevator- oh, the view. Just amazing. Its the kind of elevator that makes you want to hit the emergency button and make out, except that now I'm old enough to think 1) elevators are probably really germy places 2) there's probably a camera in that elevator (not my thing so much, but I'm not judging), and 3) what if there was a real emergency? what kind of jerk would I be? ok, I digress.  After checking in with the hostess we got drinks at the bar. Yes, I know, people complain about the drinks being too expensive, they're $10-$15. But the price is comparable to any other high end restaurant in the valley, and they're all alcohol. I'd rather pay top dollar for a stiff drink than have 3 watered down drinks. The Sunset Martini was soooo good.   We were shown to our table, a big booth facing the fireplace, perfect for a romantic dinner. The service was fantastic, really- its what Mastro's was back in the day. I had the artichoke bisque (a special for Restaurant Week but I didn't want the rest of the menu, so they accommodated me and let me get it anyway)- it was very tasty (the pancetta didn't hurt). Hubby had a beet salad that he enjoyed, and got the scallops which were cooked perfectly. I had the shrimp/scallop steaks wrapped in jalapeno bacon and they were as good as they sound. We also got the smoked cheddar whipped potatoes (this was the only so-so part of the meal, they were on the bland side) and the mushroom risotto which was really good. Risotto is one of those things thats either cooked right or not, and it was done really well.   I can't wait to go back, it was really enjoyable."}
{"text":"I celebrated my recent birthday with my husband and daughter at the Orange Sky and I choose this restaurant as our previous experience had been wonderful, well they did not disappoint us!  We requested a table to watch the sunset and what a beautiful sunset we had!  we were seated promptly and our server was very nice and gave us excellent service. I ordered the beet salad and is so good and the salmon which was cooked perfectly. My husband and daughter split the ribeye as it is 17 oz and it was delicious just as the previous time. The selections of wine are ample and they make great martinis.  After they cleared our table, our waiter came with a beautiful Birthday chocolate little cake, with \"Happy Birthday\"  written on the plate, that was a very nice touch. I recommend this restaurant to anybody wanting to have good service, good food and an amazing sunset!"}
{"text":"We love to fine dine at this place, especially in the dining booth.  The dining booth has a sofa and bunch of pillows, where you and your significant other can eat and REALLY relax.  It's very PRIVATE and has great view.  We have been here at least 3 times, for birthday, anniversary, etc.  The food are great, we love the SCALLOPS and TENDERLOIN.  Just remember, you have to spend at least $125 to dine in the dining booth."}
{"text":"I've heard lots of great things about Orange Sky, mostly regarding its view and ambiance! I'm so glad I had my 24th birthday dinner here.  We were lucky to get a private booth without reservation that evening. All the food we ordered tasted wonderful, especially being paired with the wine we chose. The service was impeccable. Our server was patient to recommend appetizer and entree. She was also knowledge on the wine pairing options! There was also a lovely live band playing in the hall music  As for the view, I'd LOVE to dine here again during sunset.After all, there aren't many restaurants located high enough for a scenic view in Arizona, right?   I highly recommend this place for a nice date. Definitely get the private booth during sunset!"}
{"text":"Outstanding environs with an incredible view and a talented live musician in the evenings. Excellent service from attentive and knowledgeable staff, with several delectable food options that were pleasing to the palate. Surprisingly, only one beer choice that wasn't just another tasteless nationwide-brand lager. While the food was legitimately delicious, my experience never recovered from seeing fois gras on the menu, because I know the cruelty geese must experience to produce this. If patrons saw how their choice of fois gras caused a goose to have a large steel pipe constantly forced deep down their throats, I doubt they would enjoy the rest of their dining experience either."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure to eat at the back bar at Orange Sky. The bartender was friendly and attentive and made a great Burbon Collins and suggested a delicious Zin for dinner.   I had the oysters and the fillet (with the compound butter sauce), both which were excellent.   Unfortunately, it took some time for my dinner to come out of the kitchen despite the fact that the restaurant was not all that busy. This made a quick bite turn in to a multi-hour affair. Additionally, it was disappointing that you are exiled to the no-view back bar if you want to have an entr√©e at a bar.   Otherwise, I had a great time. I would recommend reserving a west facing table around sunset if you're looking for a great romantic setting."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here was very nice.  Try to get a west facing window seat ($200 minimum check), but worth it.  Nice selection, everything was great except for the actual meal.  Both of our steaks were overdone, chewy and were to charred.  Order something else but a steak.  Also, seems to be run by a bunch of kids, could be run much better that's for sure"}
{"text":"This review is for a venue used for dinner programs with a speaker.    First of all the I was frustrated with the parking.  They had an event going on, which is probably pretty common here, so parking was pretty full.  I decided to take my chances with the parking garage and I'm pretty sure I got the last spot on the top level.  I was at the north end by the stairs and saw the sign for the elevators so I took the stairs since it was only the 3rd level.  That was a mistake because that led me down a long walkway to the employee entrance!  I went in and they told me I had to go back through the parking garage.  Luckily there was a golf cart that took me to the front entrance.    The signs led me to the Orange Sky on the 15th floor.  I mad it up there and was escorted to our meeting room.  It was an interior room, long and pretty narrow with a long table with seating for 10 on each side and one on each end.  I sat at the end away from the speaker.  By the time I finally got to the room it had taken me 50 minutes to get there from home, half the time after arriving looking for parking.  The room was quiet but was kind of dark.  I could not even make out the speaker, he was just a dark silhouette against the screen.  The screen was also partially blocked from the the lights above the table.    I got there 10 minutes before the meeting was to start but by then the appetizers were pretty much gone.  It didn't matter too much because the closest was 5 feet away from me.  The seafood app. was about 15 feet away and a couple of cheese plates 20.  I can't comment on the quality of the apps because I didn't have the opportunity to try any.  Tip!  Since putting the apps on the table don't give everyone an opportunity to try them why not have a separate table against the wall to put the apps and serve buffet style. Simple! Since the apps are served before the lecture would not interfere.  They way they did it is not working!  The selection was less than at most other venues, only two entrees.  Most have 3, usually salmon with the chicken and steak.  I had the steak which was decent.  Not USDA prime but not bad and it had grill marks like a steak should!  They didn't ask how we wanted it cooked but was medium plus.  I'd prefer a tad less cooked but close.  The chicken looked good.  The skin looked crispy!  After seeing the chicken I think I would have gone with that.    After the talk I left so didn't get to see much else but the bar area looked pretty nice and was full at 8:45pm with live music."}
{"text":"The restaurant is by far one of the nicest in town. Our server was attentive and service was quick. However we had a few minor issues. 1. Husband ordered the brentwood corn and although not a normal request he asked for the duck egg to be poached hard. Server said no problem but then it arrived soft. I can eat soft, so it was fine for me, but sort of disappointed that they chose to ignore his request.  2. My side was Agave and Chili roasted carrots. I'm assuming they roasted them to aldente, but some were hard as a rock while others were soft.  For $10 sides they should all be consistent and cooked to perfection.  3. The desert options were pretty limited for such a nice place. I order some sort of cigar crepe. It was horrible. Ice cream was the best part but how do you screw that up. The cigar crepes seemed like something my kid would make in my own kitchen when there was nothing else to make. My suggestion is to take this off the menu. 4. Then finally the biggest mistake of all is that when the bill arrived it was nearly $500. After almost having a heart attack we saw that the server added 4 other entrees to our bill. I am assuming it was an honest mistake, but really double checked the bill after that.  We didn't let these minor details ruin our evening. My husband had the steak and I had the sea bass. Both cooked to perfection and were delicious, and the oyster appetizer was incredible. The liquor was poured generously, so that helps, but they may want to watch over serving. There was a woman who made a scene and had to be escorted out.  Not something you normally see in a fine dining environment but made for a good dinner show.  My husband and I dine out frequently and we have our favorites list for celebrations. Unfortunately this one will not make our return list.  When we pay that much, it's gotta be perfect.  Sorry you missed it Orange Sky."}
{"text":"How about we gamble and then go upstairs for dinner? Haha. :))  Orange sky is a very warm, classy, and a romantic restaurant to have a date night. We dressed up of course and we looked amazing! :)  I had made a reservation for two next to the window at private booth. I was a disappointed when he sat down in the middle of the restaurant not next to the window and was not private...  Being a vegetarian is a pain, but if course the chef whipped up something... and it was amazing, quinoa, fresh vegetables and the asparagus so tasty and crispy. :) the gnocchi... so chewy and had a weird after taste.. Mister order the steak, he said it was \"ehhhh\" He said the steak can be more juicy..  Love the patio view. So romantic looking over the city :)"}
{"text":"I've been to orange sky a couple times now and have had great experiences. Always clean, courteous, great views of the valley, and the food is amazing....will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I went to Orange Sky Saturday night for cocktails and a dinner party. It was my first time at this restaurant and I always like to use Yelp to read reviews and see other people's thoughts. I would say the reviews were 50-50 some people complained about the food a lot of people complained about the service.  I got to say the service was spectacular. Every person I passed even if it was one that bussed  tables, said hi with a smile. Our servers we're always prompt, could give food recommendations and understood the menu, and always checked up to see if we needed anything else. I don't know if they have been looking at the reviews and had some type a meeting with the staff to make sure that they were friendly and their service was great at all times, but whatever the case was they definitely made sure they were doing things right.  The food was awesome. I had a rare ribeye, mind you 17 ounces so I shared it with someone and it was cooked to perfection. I also had the garlic mashed potatoes and they were yummy as well. Everyone at the table enjoyed their food.  I did have a couple cocktails. My first cocktail was the Orange Moscow Mule. I did not enjoy it maybe it was the orange flavor or my disappointment that it was not served in a copper mug. What's the point of offering a Moscow mule when you don't have a copper mug if I would've known that I probably would not have ordered it. My next cocktail was the Raspberry Mojito it looked beautiful and it tasted yummy. It was a little on the tart side but I enjoyed it.   It's not cheap to eat there my ribeye was $45 but for two people definitely well worth it also there are sides it says they serve two people but you could probably share a side with four people for about 15 bucks. The drinks are $18 apiece which is normal for that type of restaurant.  Last but not least, the ambience is fabulous. The bar and restaurant area is surrounded by glass so you can see the north, south, east, and west sides of the valley with all the mountain views. We went before the sunset which is a must do if you plan on going there.  Even though prices might be a little high you need to remember this restaurant is on the reservation so there is no sales tax and as a reminder they include the gratuity already in your bill, 20%."}
{"text":"I loved the food and the area there definitely coming back, our server was Demetrio and he did an amazing job at serving me and my wife ! Thank you Demetrio i will be requesting you next time!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is fantastic. We came here to celebrate our anniversary and everything was great. Service, food, views...top notch. I highly recommend it. The only drawback is that you have to walk through the smoky casino to get to the restaurant.  Once you are there, it doesn't smell like smoke. Make sure to make a reservation ahead of time and try to get by a window."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing!!  We went for the NYE pre-fix menu and loved everything we ordered.  The staff was great.  The manager went out of her way to help us after dinner with getting out tickets for the NYE party.  I highly recommend this place for dinner."}
{"text":"My boyfriend brought me here on my first visit to Scottsdale. He also brought me to Sassi that weekend, so clearly he was trying to give me an impression of Scottsdale by exploiting my love for good local cuisine. Guess what it worked, I've been back to visit three times since (okay the guy has a good thing to do with it).  Orange Sky has a few really great things going for it. The first is the picturesque view. Second is the little nook-like banquettes that can be reserved which are like private little romantic crescent. I'd be lying if I said we didn't have a mini kiss fest. Plan to have a 3 course meal in order to meet the minimum at these tables. Third is the impeccable and attentive service (but not too attentive as to interrupt our make out session).  The menu is fairly traditional with steak, seafood and seasonal ingredients. The only thing I didn't care much for was my cocktail. Very strong which I'd assume has something to do with an older crowd that frequents the casino.  Menu- http://www.urbanspoon.com/cities/22-phoenix/restaurants/1519767-orange-sky/menu"}
{"text":"This was our first time at Orange Sky. The appearance of the restaurant is very elegant from the floor to ceiling windows to the way the dining room is set up to the outside area where you can take pictures. The staff is extremely courteous and make you feel like you are the only one in the place! The food was amazing, as well as the  presentation of the  food. Definitely worth the money and experience.....you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I didnt think this place was anything special. Plus, they forgot my sauce for the steak and over cooked my steak (ordered rare definitely was medium rare going on medium). I also didn't think the steak had great flavor. We also ordered their dessert which I wasn't a fan of. Wouldn't go back for the price."}
{"text":"This was definitely the fanciest restaurant I have ever been to and probably will ever go to. Sunset was breathtaking. They have a large outdoor patio with fireplaces and an Infiniti pool which I'm sure would be amazing in winter. Service was top notch. The food was great albeit a bit small but delicious, wish my $48 steak came with a side but I digress. All in all a wonderful experience and a great way to celebrate a new beginning in scottsdale. Our bill for three was $240 plus $80 on wine. So it's definitely spendy but worth it."}
{"text":"Beautiful and romantic restaurant. It is located at a higher level of Talking Stick Resort that you have to take an elevator to. You have to be on the list to enter. If you dine here during the sunset, you're in for a treat. It's not called Orange Sky for nothing! Beautiful views of the sunset and the desert! The food is always delicious here, too. We have spent Thanksgiving here for dinner a few years ago and the staff made it really special. Wonderful service and great food. Take her here on a date! And then play the tables after."}
{"text":"A Christmas dinner is not like any other meal. So when my friends suggested Orange Sky I was beyond excited! The ride up to the restaurant was fun in itself. The elevator with an open view to the mountains was breathtaking, but alas, too short.  We arrived a early for our reservations, so we made friends with a Richard at the bar. Although already helping a number of guests he was eager to attend to our needs. A visit to Orange Sky really could be complete with someone like Richard. Such a gem! Well versed in his product line and so, so polite!   Note: There are *two* bar areas at Orange Sky. There is the large area when you step off the elevator. There is also an indoor bar, which is in the main dining area. The interior bar seems suited for eating a quick nibble too.  Once seated in our deluxe VIP western facing booths, our party was in heaven. The booths are incredibly high and offer the utmost privacy. You could seat three average sized adults in the booth. Additionally, a seat could be placed at each end of the table. I'd stick with three/four adults however. (Two for romance, Four for fun, Five for late night.)  Food wise? Er. Ma. Gawd.  That's pretty much it. I stuck with the Holiday Menu and ate so much it hurt (later). Yes, that's what happened. I admit it! My eyeballs were filled to the rims with what was on the plate and I ate. Four courses later I wheeled myself out on my knee scooter. A much happier, fuller, person.  I highly recommend trying the Lobster Bisque soup. Not only for the exquisite presentation, the lobster was beautifully laid at the bottom of the plate prior to the bisque being poured, but for the richness of what my palate discovered. YUM! (Ate it all.)  The Bib & Point Reyes Blue Salad, with walnuts, pears, pancetta and dried cranberries was an enormous presentation. Light as air dressing included blue cheese (that was a surprise!). (Ate it all.)  By the time my main entree arrived I was stuffed. But, have no fear, I welcomed Mediterranean Bass like there was no tomorrow. When something is stuffed with crab meat and the hollandaise is so light, well, you make do. (Ate it all.)  Dessert was a blur. Eggnog was involved. (Ate it all.)  Our seats afforded the most wonderful views of Phoenix I've had to date. The food was amazing. Exploring the outdoor patio was fun. I can't wait to come back to enjoy drinks another time!  Four Stars: Only per a hiccup noted with the downstairs check-in. I've reached out to the restaurant.   This place is stellar!  Updated: Oops! Forgot to mention our bomb diggity server Nicole S. She reached out to me. She's super chipper and really knows the menu well! You'll love her too!"}
{"text":"Wonderful Experience.  Enjoyed the Sunset view and the marvelous food in our Private Booth. Waitress was a bit stressed however as she apparently was assigned other tables a distance away from our private booth.  Management needs to review private booth assignments as pricing warrants SPECIAL SERVICE in addition to the Special Food and view."}
{"text":"Huge disappointment. The views are amazing, but this place is missing some serious potential.  I have no problem paying $42 for a rack of lamb, but not when the dish has been defrosted and their are no side dishes.  It was over cooked and tasteless meat, but I must say the glaze was good.  Same thing goes for the sea bass.  It was either old or frozen fish. Lacking any sign of freshness.  The sweet potato side dish was almost laughable.  They literally cut it, threw butter on it and then through a tablespoon of goat cheese on top for $10. The views save this place from the over price, underwhelming food experience. Forgot to mention, after having a drink in the lounge (which we waited 15 min for), I was carded at the table which turned into a scene when they had to take my ID to get scanned (35 years old!)."}
{"text":"Wow! There are no words to describe this dining experience! Thank you, Demitrio, for the absolutely fantastic service!! You are a true master of your craft and your warm, authentic smile was icing on the cake!  We went on a Friday night at 7pm to enjoy a West facing table. We were ten minutes late but welcomed with smiles and seated immediately. Our water, wine and cocktails were served within minutes and the appetizers followed soon after.  There wasn't a single element that did not surpass my expectations. The friendliness of every member of the staff was so wonderful. We were made to feel welcome and treated like royalty from the very beginning through to the very end!  The quality, presentation and flavor of the food was impeccable! I will let the photos speak for themselves. We were waited on by several bussers who kept the table spotless throughout the entire experience. Demitrio's wine recommendation was excellent and paired so well with our steak and crab.   I could easily go on and on about the numerous details that made this an over-the-top dining experience but I'll just suggest you try it out for yourself! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for a pre vday dinner. It was the first time being here for both of us and we were excited to see what all the fuss was about. Our dinner reservation was for 930pm so we called at 8 to see if they could possibly fit is in sooner. They lady said \"yes come in and we will seat you as soon as possible\" and informed us we could hang out in the lounge. So we came in and waited...and waited...and waited. 9pm came around, we were still waiting. Given that our reservation wasn't until 930, i remained patient. 930 comes around, then 945... This whole time watching people come in and get seated right away or soon after arriving. Finally at 10:10pm they finally came over and said they were ready for us. We were pretty much the last to be seated even with arriving an hour and half before our reservation!!! By this point I didn't even want to eat there anymore but we waited that long, my as well try it out. Going in I was expected to see room full of people which would make the long wait acceptable. Instead the room was half empty.. And to top it off we were seated in the middle of the room with little privacy, even though they had open seats next to the windows with beautiful views. Our view was the couple in the booth in front of our table making out and taking selfie after selfie. The only good thing I can say about whole thing was the food. The food was really good. I had the salmon and my boyfriend had the rib eye steak which both were cooked perfectly. This however, did not make up for the complete lack of service from the hosts. Needless to say I will not be going here again nor will I recommend this restaurant to anyone. Such a disappointment."}
{"text":"I flew in from Dallas to have NYE w my boyfriend (a local business owner) on 12/31/2016.  We were greeted by friendly staff and was seated at the bar to wait for our table.  We were eventually seated and proceeded with the pre-set menu.  The service and view were spectacular but little else came w the hefty price tag for the evening. THE FOOD WAS TERRIBLE!!!  Taco Bell would have been a better option in the taste department.   Dry, flavorless and tough!!.  Right down to the dessert!.  We both had funny stomachs the next day.   If I hadn't known better, the food had been sitting out for hours prior to being served.  WHO???? was in charge of that kitchen?  Just saying they'll never get another dime from us."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a great meal for my birthday on Monday evening.  The food and service was fantastic! There were 5 in our party and we all enjoyed the appetizers and the entrees. The rib eye steaks were out of this world, the elk and bison were cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"The views and ambience is worth the 5 star rating in itself. I was sceptical to try the elks lion, being that I've never ate this style of meat before. Our waitresses  description made all the difference and it was worth the chance! Menu is not too busy, great wine and drink selection. Overall, a great intimate setting to spend our 3 year wedding anniversary."}
{"text":"High above the Arizona dessert sits Orange Sky, a super classy restaurant with a stunning view of the surrounding mountains and cityscape. The meal itself was a three star experience, but when you consider the incredible ambiance, I could have been eating McDonalds and wouldn't have cared.   I was more than impressed with the atmosphere before we even sat down. We waited for our seats on a glass balcony that protected us from the wind and while standing at the handsome curved bar. Walking to our table, we passed many an elegant private room and some booths with views that would have made for perfect date nights. Our group made reservations far in advance, so we were guaranteed a lovely patio setting with panoramic views.   The service was prompt and consistent. My only beef (no pun intended) was with the beef tenderloin, two four ounce cuts presented plainly and without any accompaniments on a large white plate. Talk about feeling like you didn't get your moneys worth. The beef was tasty, but it left me hungry enough that I needed sides and to share someone else's plate just to be full.   That one dish was the only hiccup. Other than that, you can expect a memorable dining experience that you'll surely be reccomending to friends!"}
{"text":"Our event ( our WEDDING) was mishandled entirely. When the bride is in tears with one of the waiting staff after the ceremony you know there was a miss. I wish I got the waitresses name because she made me feel better that we would be taken care of and our guests. You could tell they were really trying hard to fix everything on their end to leave the night on a good note . The bartender gave us a good experience as well. In fact, he is the one that ran down the stairs to see why the ceremony wasn't beginning.( Door was locked. Edward called and reminded them about bride using this entrance two days prior and we talked to the spa manager face to face and she was more than happy to help us. I believe this was the breaking point for myself ) The lack of preparation, customer service,support and overall experience falls on the lack of leadership that was displayed with management staff and hotel staff. Let me begin by saying we chose this as our wedding site because of the food, balcony that really served as a real intimate location and we overall loved this restaurant. We also liked the idea our guests could go to the club or gamble afterwards. Seemed perfect. In fact Edward and I thought this would be so much easier and less stressful to have at this location.We were wrong . They blamed management changes . If professionalism was displayed this would not of  been an issue for clients paying thousands of dollars to use your restaurant . First we had Felicia. Who was amazing promised us a lot made it seem like we picked the right place to spend our money. We talked about photography ( she said no problem to use grounds and restaurant we just need security clearance. Wrong . Fast forward to two years later a week before the wedding. Kandiss tells us no and huge miscommunication. I expressed that I would of not spent 5000 on a private Photographer and would of gone another route if you guys gave us different information. ) We also discussed about personalizing the menus to make it more personal and between all three Felicia Christina and Candiss they seemed on board. Didn't happen in fact they had the wrong soup on the menu and I quote from a waiter, \" I do apologize but we ran out of time\". They ran out of time? We have been planning this for a very long time ! Let me remind everyone thousands of dollars and this is our wedding. Our communication was ignored and the day of our event was ridiculous and stressful . Even my photographer, who does a lot of high end weddings and photo shoots was in disbelief with the lack of professionalism with hotel staff and Orange Sky management with our event. ( I could go on and on about the lack of communication prior and day of . Let's just say the happiest day of our lives was overshadowed by a lot of UNNEEDED stress. Our guests even took notice. We could share so much more that happened but I think if your reading this review you understand how our event turned out . Little things matter when you plan an event and we had our fill of apologies last Saturday."}
{"text":"This is my third time to Orange Sky and I keep asking why?  The ambiance is FANTASTIC, truly stunning, fun, edgy and amazing views...which is why we keep coming back.  A great destination restaurant when family/friends come in town and you want to show the valley to them (Def. book a reservation for sunset time...so you can watch the valley's magnificent setting of the sun).  The food is fine...has always been tasty....but I expect that for Orange Sky prices.  But the service is embarrassing. Has to be poor training/management.  Consistantly disorganized, scattered and pitiful.  You have to strain to find a manger, server, bus boy etc.  The hostess always seem scared and confused when you ask them a question about your reservation.  Our last visit....and truly our last visit.....our server was seemingly professional, seemed to be in his early 40's...so seemed to be a career waiter and he seemed knowlegeable about the menu which was a pleasant surprise b/c former waiters had seemed ignorant about the menu.........we were jazzed b/c we thought finally Orange Sky \"gets\" that they have to hire and train their staff on appropriate/high end restaurant service.  Well Michael (our waiter) was a totall disappointment...he either was petrified of the chef or an arrogant d*ck.  We asked that our salads be chopped and he said the kitchen was too busy to chop a salad.  I explained that I would like to talk to a chef that wants his waitstaff telling customers that they are too busy to chop a salad......he said he would try to ask the kitchen to chop the salad for us, but they were really busy and he could not make any promises.  I again explained that our expectation is that our salad be chopped upon presentation and if it was not, we would not pay for that salad and would send it back and contiue to send it back until chopped.....he never relented to say that the salad would be chopped....just he would \"try\".  ( Of course the salad came chopped...but the interaction was strange.)  Then when two of us ordered our steaks, one of us ordered it medium well...after the waiter asked how she wanted her steak cooked.  When she said medium well....he said that it not the proper way to cook a steak and the kitchen prefers it to be cooked just medium.  So I said why even bother asking how she wanted her steak to be cooked and he said well he assumed she would \"know the proper degree of cooking for a filet\".  Again we asked for the manager and of course no manager came.  When our entrees arrived, the assistant waiter ( I think every table has two waitstaff or one in training...not sure) brought everyone's entrees but had no clue who got what and four of us got the filet.......but cooked at different temperature......when we asked if were receiving the correct steak....she said she did not know..and we should cut into our steak and figure it out ourselves......when the gal who ordered her steak medium well...cut into hers while the waitress was there, she could tell it was rare and she told the waitress and the waitress told her to \"swap with someone else at the table to find her right steak\".    So, not a rude or snotty staff....but running ragged, afraid of the chef or kitchen...but sorely .ill trained on fine dining and somewhat embarrassing on their lack of decorum for a luxury restaurant.  So have to give it only three stars.  I want to love this place...but cannot if the staff continues to be so sub par."}
{"text":"It was a wonderful experience! But if u views and atmosphere!  Our server was wonderful,  he helped us pick the perfect dishes!!! Everything we ordered was delicious! Sea Bass was \"like butter\""}
{"text":"The staff was as charming and gracious as they could possibly be. The food had so many \"wow that's good\" events. Will go back as soon as possible."}
{"text":"I can't say enough amazing things about the  manager, Mark at Orange Sky. I had my mom and aunt visiting me from Chicago and Sacramento and was taking them to the Gino Vannelli concert at the Showroom in Talking Stick Casino. He made our visit to Orange Sky the most incredible experience. We were able to enjoy the most beautiful views from every angle Orange Sky has to offer and the best Limoncello Drop martinis we've ever had. Mark was extremely accommodating and treated us like gold. I will always be grateful for Mark and making our visit unforgettable. If I could give him 10 stars, I would!"}
{"text":"Perfect romantic date night spot!   Let's start with ambiance...if you reserve a private booth facing west and come just before sunset you get a super snugly pillowed booth.  Unexpectedly the automatic blinds open to sheer curtains revealing pointing mountain tips. As you wait with anticipation the sheer blinds slowly pull back to reveal breathtaking view of the the sun plunging deeply into the crevice between the two large alert mountain points. It's fabulous!    The menu changes frequently but this summer if you make it try the smashed potatoes with sherry vinegar and artichoke hearts. You're welcome in advance. Steak is always perfect and there is always a variety of wild game options.   Claudia the hostess worked with us with no reservations much appreciation to a great young lady with a fabulous attitude. Our waiter Julio is the deep voiced master of menus. Great staff, great chef, great view."}
{"text":"There have been few occasions where I have actually wanted to walk out on my meal. Congrats to Orange Sky. I came here for my 5th anniversary and sat in one of the beautiful private booths overlooking the most spectacular sunset. That's where the beauty stopped. It's now been three hours and I am still sitting here unattended to. The food? Nothing short of pedestrian and poorly executed at high prices. The service?  Simply absent. The bill? Incorrect. A few pointers I feel obligated to give the management: - When making the reservation and seating your guests, don't ask twice if we are celebrating something special if you don't plan on congratulating or mentioning it at dinner.  - White wine should be chilled, not set on the table. It does not need to \"open up\" like a red might so a full glass is not necessary.  - Medium rare steak should be medium rare throughout. Not well done to rare depending on where you cut.  - If your sole is fishy, it doesn't matter if you bake it and overwhelm it with ravioli, it still shouldn't be served.  - When sauce sits under the heat lamp for too long, it forms a film.  - If you don't have a qualified pastry chef on staff, don't offer dessert. A two-day old coffee cake with sorbet does not do the trick.   I think cooking is an art and as a former restaurant reviewer and proud home chef myself, I hate to leave a scathing review such as this. If it weren't for the sunset at Orange Sky, I would have left...which says more than words."}
{"text":"Great steaks, service less than expected for a group spending over $1000 on dinner. For the spend, stick with the big names. Ruth's, Fleming's."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely amazing. I had my bachelorette party here and they made sure they took care of my group. We did make a reservation ahead of time in order to make sure we got a table (the restaurant was super busy when we came). We ordered the cheese board and calamari to start with for appetizers. Super delish! and they also give you bread and butter to snack on. My meal of choice was a the veal chop and it was cooked perfectly! I shared the smashed potato side with my friend and the artichokes that came with is was amazing. Definitely recommend if you're looking for a classy dinner."}
{"text":"An extraordinary experience. That's what you get when you make a reservation to this beautiful restaurant.   I'll start by saying this is already an advantaged encounter because of its location. Situated on the top of Talking Stick Resort, on Indian Bend and 101. You get a wonderful 270 degree view of the valley. My best friend and I were lucky enough to catch the sunset. I recommend you bring a nice camera cause I took amazing pictures. Upon our arrival, they immediately seated us. I wasn't thrilled they put us in the middle of the dining room, but I later found out this restaurant charges you an extra fee for a table with a view. Fair enough. We stepped outside several times for pictures so it was good anyway.   Michael was our server, he did a great job introducing specials and giving us recommendations on dishes. We started with crab cakes, then I had the shrimp and scallops, my girlfriend had the halibut. Both good. But what impressed us most was the sweet potato side with goat cheese! We LOVED it!  Since it was my birthday, desserts were on the house. Very nice of them.   Atmosphere was trendy, this is a perfect place to dress up and put your favorite heels on! ;) it was a Friday night and they also had live music with a moderate spacious dancing floor.  So do you want to have a good time and awesome food? Go to this restaurant!  Thank you Orange Sky, our experience was unforgettable."}
{"text":"To start the live music is amazing and the hostess staff that greet you are so professional and kind. We had a reservation and showed up a little early and told them we would grab some drinks before until they were ready for us. The staff said we could go ahead and head back to our table. We had a private dining experience and it was absolutely stunning. The view was perfect to watch the sunset and the room felt like private dining. Very comfortable! Our server demitrio was not only knowledgeable of the menu but allowed us to take our time and even encouraged us to go look at the view from the patio.   I am so thankful we did because the view of the golf course from the top of the building was stunning! There aren't enough kind words for our server he was amazing and so very kind. He knew my boyfriend would be purposing to me and wanted it to be special and I knew after that he knew ahead of time. Knowing that now really makes me appreciate all he did even more to make my night special. He doesn't even know me and he went above and beyond for us! I recommend asking for him at your next visit.    Now for the food...I ordered the salmon and he ordered the filet. It was amazing! The salmon was seasoned to perfection and fell apart with my fork. The side of crushed potatoes was one of my new favorite dishes and he loved the perfect cook to his steak. We were stuffed by the end! Then to finish it up he brought out a desert that said congratulations! So sweet of them to do that and then knowing I had a dairy allergy brought me out the most delicious sorbet I have ever had. I will literally dream of the apple and cherry sorbet. Seriously it was amazing. They know what they are doing and if you are considering coming here for any special occasion or just for an amazing dining experience I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Very good service and great place for date night. One of the best steaks in town and great  selection of wine, we're definitely going back there."}
{"text":"Of course, the view is spectacular, but we always come for the food, which is cooked well, thoughtfully created, and delicious.  The combination of sweet, spicy, and savory on the lamb chops with an ancho honey glaze is divine, and the lamb is good so well--juicy and tender.  The Jidori chicken is tender and flavorful, and it is a large portion of protein (but definitely order a side to complement it!).  The Chilean sea bass has always come out perfectly cooked and is light, flavorful, and really quite a large portion for a sea bass entree!  For sides, the roasted sweet potatoes are nice if you want a taste of fall.  The green chile whipped potatoes have a nice depth of flavor, and it is a nice take on classic mashed potatoes -- this is one of our go-tos when we dine in.  The only disappointment I've had here is with the gnocchi side, which is very, very small in portion--it is the type of dish where you can easily count how many are on the plate. The few on the plate were delicious, at least!  It is at odds with the other sides, which are easily shareable."}
{"text":"Outstanding sunset dinner in one of the seven very private booths facing the west -- unlike any seating anywhere else in the world.  The staff is attentive, accommodating and professional. The food is superb - scallops and elk is what we had after a seafood platter enough for two. Add a bottle of first rate champagne and finish off sharing a dessert and you can't make a more memorable dining experience."}
{"text":"Please read the canned response from management to my previous reviews. Gives you a good idea of what they think of the customer here."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place, I don't get why the reviews don't reflect it. For the views and atmosphere ALONE I would give it five stars. We went for a late night dinner at the bar area in the back, but got to see all the really cool private dining areas they have with views. It felt like Vegas!  Really amazing.  We are vegetarian and not a lot on the menu as far as dinner entrees we could eat (in fact, none) but we did a la carte sides and they were really yummy. The broccolini, caesar salad, steak fries and bread were great. I really enjoyed the modern design and sleek atmosphere. When you see all the little private dining areas (reservations needed for those I'm sure) that also have super incredible views, you will be sold. I truly forgot that I was in Arizona. I felt like we were in a big city or in Vegas. Cool place."}
{"text":"Omg! Yum! Oysters were excellent, wagyu was great also the little tray of sauces were awesome!!! Fried green tomatoes were perfect!!! Everything the bone marrrow! Mushroom truffle bread appetizer was amazing!!! Can't wait to go back! Great service as well! Beautiful views!"}
{"text":"The food was phenomenal. Nothing more to say other than the ribe eye was melt in your mouth. Crab Louie salad incredible and the crab legs were superb. We had a private room for a birthday celebration. They also have romantic tables that face the view from the 15th floor and a large outside patio that when warmer will be a must visit spot. I made sure to experience everything the hotel/casino had to offer, from drinks in the atrium bar, gambling, dinner at Orange Sky, dancing on the 14th floor, dueling pianos in the atrium, I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Burnt Rib eye steak. High expectations, and was totally let down by having a nice large steak that was burnt on one side, and had terrible flavor.  - Wife had the swordfish, she said it was excellent.   Don't know that I'd be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"What a beautiful experience! Thank you Candiss. The food exceeded expectations and the view was spectacular! Sean you did an amazing job, thanks for your recommendations."}
{"text":"We had dinner at Orange Sky on a recent Friday evening. I'd caution folks about eating here. Our experience was mostly negative because of the poor service. The food quality was also mixed. The views, however, are fantastic, and the private dining areas offer a romantic setting.  Here is a quick summary of our visit: - We waited a good 30 minutes before we were seated at our table. - After seating, we waited another 15 minutes before our waiter came to take our drink orders. And then another 10 minutes for our food order to be taken. - Our food order got lost. It took more than an hour after we placed our food order for our meals to arrive! Our waiter was mostly nonexistent during this time: Our drinks went empty, and we had to flag down someone else for refills. We seriously contemplated leaving because we were famished and frustrated! - Our waiter finally showed up about 40 minutes into our wait. He apologized and brought us a shrimp cocktail on the house. Our waiter later offered us free dessert (which we ordered To go for fear of another long wait). - Our entrees were good. I had the salmon which was very fresh and nicely seared. I thought the flavors were great. - Our sides were not good, and we left them mostly untouched. The pasta and pea dish was too salty to eat. It also contained a chunk of greens that would not separate and were therefore difficult to eat. Our fried green tomatoes tasted like a frozen dinner that they had microwaved."}
{"text":"Fantastic!! We haven't been to Orange Sky in a while but will go back soon... our waiter Julio was fabulous .. he was very attentive and super nice!! The food was sooo good ! And they had great entertainment!! Thanks for a great night"}
{"text":"The service was excellent. Greg did an amazing job. The food too (both filet) was fantastic. The filets were cooked and seasoned perfectly. The wine list was exceptional and not too pricey."}
{"text":"First off- this place has an amazing view. Set upon the 15th floor of the Talking Stick Casino- make sure and make reservations for sunset, as obviously this is what it is named for.  They have private seating areas that are secluded and could be a very romantic setting- although we didn't sit at one of these booths because we had a large table.  I suggest making a reservation if you'd like to eat here. Also, make sure and go into the actual restaurant and not just the bar area- it is separated.    Service: On point!  The waiters came full of recommendations and were very attentive .   Food:  Amazing!  Simple, yet elegant menu, reasonable portion sizes (large enough to split), and great presentation.   I had the seasonal oysters (very clean- served with cocktail sauce and fresh grated horseraddish root), twin fillets (enough for 2), truffle baked potato (very rich and plenty to share with 2-4), carrots (everyone always forgets about this veggie- they did it up right), mushroom risotto (decadent) .    Drinks: Large wine menu but glass prices were a little high.    Atmosphere: They had a great piano player and singer in the bar/lounge area when you walked in.  They also had several patio areas which we did not visit because it was quite chilly out.   *One complaint- I came to the bar side first before our reservations and ordered a glass of wine that was $13/glass.  When I got my tab it was $17.50, and did not include gratuity. I did not want to complain, but it was a little strange.  Same thing happened to the two girls next to me.  Still not sure what this *upcharge* was for."}
{"text":"My boyfriend surprised me with two nights at TSR for our anniversary. I have reviews of our experience of the hotel and the spa but wanted to write a separate review for  our experience at Orange Sky.  As my other reviews stated, service at this hotel overall is a bit mixed, maybe 2.5 stars at best. When we checked in at the desk on the Casino floor before going up to the restaurant, the man at the desk asked for our name and asked what time our reservations were for. We gave him the information and he asked again what our name was. I could clearly see were next on his list of names. We repeated it and then he just said 'ok', and another man walked over and hit the button to the elevator. No smiles from either, no 'have a nice dinner'. Neither one of them said anything more to us and it almost felt like we were interrupting their conversation.   Upon arriving on the 15th floor, the hostest informed us that our table would be about 10 minutes even though we were right on time. No big deal, we just took a seat in the lounge area and waited to get a drink. Our pre-dinner cocktails were okay but the service was slow and without a smile.  What are these people so crabby about? In addition, rather than take our order after having the menu's for 5 minutes, our waitress waited at the bar for what seemed like forever for 4 glasses of water to be filled for another table and chatted with the other waiters. Luckily once we ordered our drinks, they arrived fairly quickly and we were able to have one drink before our table was ready. Shortly thereafter, we were summoned to go with a hostest to our table.   We were lead through dancing couples on the dance floor and were sat in the second booth from the front.  The hostest never offered to pull out our table so it made it a bit awkward to get into but it was cozy once you sat down with all the pillows. We did have a nice dinner and the way the booths are positioned, it makes it feel very private...that is unless you have a noisy group next to you on the other side of the divider. Ours weren't overly noisy but you could clearly hear everything they were saying while we were busy eating.  Our waitress was more friendly after striking up a conversation and all the food was good. I had the sweet corn soup with the filet and the bf ordered a salad with the ribeye. Not anything particularly memorable but it was good.   We were given a dessert for our anniversary but can't say whether it was free or not since I didn't pay the bill :) It was good, some sort of chocolate cake with hazelnuts with some very pretty penmanship wishing us happy anniversary. It was the best service related touch we had received the whole evening.   We missed the sunset during dinner which I'm sure would have added to the experience but watching highway traffic whiz by on the 101 after dark isn't overly romantic in my opinion. Even if there are mountains in the background. Overall though, given the mediocer service at the front, the standard steak affair on the menu and lack of atmosphere past dark, I can't say that I would go back.  If you do decide to go anyway, make sure you go early enough to catch the sunset!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful evening celebrating my husbands promotion, the staff made it memorable! The setting was just stunning, floor to ceiling glass windows overlooking the desert. We sat in the dining room which was fantastic, but will have to reserve a private table next time as it looked like fun. I would recommend you try the bone marrow appetizer- so good! As a main entree we selected the Elk and Scallops, both were top quality. We will be sure to return ourselves, but recommend as a great spot to bring guests from out of town to showcase the beauty of the Valley."}
