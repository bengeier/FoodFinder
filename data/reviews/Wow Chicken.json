{"text":"Ordered half chicken Sat 5 pm, service was pretty fast,10 minutes wait only!
Absolutely overpriced & undervalued comparing to the real Kentucky Fried Chicken.  So heavily breaded, very dry, can't taste chicken at all.  Quite disappointed!"}
{"text":"Another Korean fried chicken joint in Calgary! I found the atmosphere in the restaurant to be better than Olive Chicken as it is more hip and trendy and also very colourful.  Wow Chicken offers more variety in their products than Olives. I really like their flavored spicy chicken. It is a bit expensive but what restaurant in Calgary isn't"}
{"text":"The chicken was not fresh.... It tasted old and the meat was a weird colour but the sauce on it was good. I've come here a few times a couples years ago and the chicken was very fresh, crispy and delicious, but not today. good service though from the person who took my order, she was very friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"This two star rating is based on the premise that this is a fried chicken joint, which despite the signage may not actually be the intent (details to follow). Off the bat, the half chicken (~$11) seemed pretty small...I polished it off and was still looking around for something to eat. 

The chicken itself seemed not to be marinated in any noticeable way. The coating was very crunchy, but not seasoned at all. Unlike at Olive Chicken (another Korean fried chicken spot in town), a sprinkling of salt did not bring it to life.  Another subtle distinction is that the skin at Olive is crispy (a satisfyingly delicate hardness that yields once bitten), whereas at Wow it's just thoroughly crunchy (hard after each chew).  

I had to douse the Wow chicken with Frank's Red Hot to make it becoming, and noticed that it remained pretty crunchy.  I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt here and assume the lack of seasoning and the crunchy coating are designed to accommodate pungent sauce (like chicken wings, or the elusive Nashville hot fried chicken). The chicken can be ordered tossed with a sweet, hot, or garlic ginger sauce, and I'm suggesting this is the way to go. Maybe they were inspired by Anju's much fÃªted gojuchang wings? As I mentioned at the start, this is a two-star fried chicken place, but may be a higher starred place if you go in expecting and ordering wing style chicken."}
{"text":"Fried chicken reminded me of KFCs extra crispy chicken. The batter was thick and filling, I was feeling full after one drum stick. We tried the specialty chicken, small size it was enough for several people to share. I didn't mind the flavors but just felt it was too much fried stuff for me. We had a salad (which is the only non fried thing on the menu) but it was very basic and plain, no carrots or extras. Two wedges of tomatoes and two slices of cucumbers. We went there for dinner but it is more of a place for a snack to share with a group of friends.  I would not go back because the service was so slow. And a pet peeve of mine is when a group comes in after you and they get their good before you!"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by their hours, their kitchen closes an hour early so forget about getting late night munchies; if you close at 10 that means you're functional until 10, not last order at 9."}
{"text":"This chickin is WOW just like the name.   The best chicken Ive had in Calgary.  Very clean and tasteful cozy restaurant."}
{"text":"Set up cafeteria style, you place your order (in my case, crispy chicken wings and my friends got the Gang Jeong and we shared a large fries) and take a seat while you wait for your food. K pop music videos keep you entertained, as do their unique drinks (frozen bubble beer anyone?). 

The chicken comes out super crispy (not greasy at all!) and moist at the same time.  Even though it's fast food, the staff still checks up on you to make sure you've got everything you need.

This place is a win in my books!"}
{"text":"Chicken was so bland, no flavour, so greasy, and not worth the price but the fries where ok."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time today and ordered the spicy wings. Didn't like it because the spicy glaze was rather sweet and salty and not spicy. The sauce was too complex and it ruined the wings. I had imagined spicy to be like the KFC hot wings but no they're more like a sticky glaze. 

But the wings themselves were of excellent quality and very fresh, so I'll still give this place a second chance as I think the original flavored wings are better than the flavored ones."}
{"text":"The chicken was gross. Tasted like dried up, frozen, rubbery, pop corn chicken garbage. 
The fries were alright. 
Pricey for what you get..."}
{"text":"Wow chicken did not wow me that much, I do have to give them props tho for trying. The best tasting chicken that I order was the spicy breast, and the bullgoi fries that they had were good as well. Everything else tasting like nothing. Wasn't impress, and for the price. Definitely not a place where I would recommend my friends to.

Their policy is weird tho, because I am ordering to go. I am not allowed to sit at a table while I wait for my food. Then why wasn't one of your staff at the front where the other stationary check out was. I walked all the way to the counter inside just to be rejected back to the front. Y'all need better service."}
{"text":"Crispy chicken, loved the shallot chicken and spicy specialty chicken with a combination of beer. Tastes great! 2 small chicken +beer +zero coke about 38 bucks. You can dine in or order take order, and it closes at 9pm. So if you arrive late, probably take out only."}
{"text":"I decided to check out WOW Chicken for lunch today and i ordered the shallot chicken and a small garden salad and fries in bulgogi flavour. the chicken was not as crispy as i was hoping and the flavour was a little weak. they pour a spicy mustar sauce on the chicken, but i could barely taste the mustard. The fries was pretty tasty, it was not really crispy but the bulgolgi seasoning made the fries taste sweeter and the seasoning was good. Overall i had better chicken at Yum Yum, but the atmosphere at WOW was more loungy and hip a great place to hang out with friends, they should expand their menu with more sharing apps and tapas style, that would give the place a ultimate hang out foody lounge type feel."}
{"text":"After driving past this place a few times and reading the reviews we decided to give it a try. Service was not all that friendly. The chicken had that mushy yellow stuff under the skin and did not have a taste. Will not be returning.  Sorry."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! Love love love the veggie tampura! The chicken is super light and flakey and not greasy at all."}
{"text":"Ok so this is my first review for 2014.  I guess Korean fried chicken has finally made its way to Calgary, Alberta.   I found out about KFC (Korean fried chicken) in Anaheim, California and damn it was good.  Beats Colonels recipe and Church's.  I have yet to try Popeyes.  

So this isn't my first rodeo with KFC in Calgary.  I have tried Olive Chicken.  I prefer wow for many things.  Let me start with the fascility.  Wow....very nice decor and Korean music videos playing.  Staff was alright, you know...attractive young ladiea.  The management team have their own table and just watch these girls.  Downside to this place is one restroom.  Wanted to wash my hands but their was a guy doing his business. 

Ok so let's get to the food.  Side of fries with bulgogi spice.   SO GOOD!  And washed it down with a frosty bubble beer.  Nice touch.  We ordered the shallot chicken and the gang jeong (warning, pretty spicy).  So the wings came with this sauce that was highlighted with thin slices of green onion strands.  The crunch of the skin with this nice oniony salad.  Really good.   The gang jeong. ...have your drink ready for this boneless spicy chicken nugget.  Really good!  Yes I know I said that already, this is a must try place in Calgary."}
{"text":"Had the Original recipe chicken - half and half so one half that was just the plain recipe with no sauce and the other half with soy garlic. Original recipe tasted and had texture
of Popeyes chicken. Me who enjoys lots of sauce and flavour, I enjoyed the soy garlic. It wasn't drenched in sauce, just lightly dipped in it. Also tried their gang-jeong chicken which were very saucy and were popcorn chicken (boneless). They're spicy and sweet and a thick crispy layer of batter."}
{"text":"Wow definitely describes this chicken!  KFC pales in comparison, mind you not  difficult being that KFC is not great. Tried the half and half and it was amazing.  I have heard the shallot chicken is good as well,  may have to try it next time. Can't comment on restaurant as my fam picked up take out."}
{"text":"I ordered half chicken extra crispy last week and it was horrible. The chicken was still raw inside and we got really sick. I will never order from this place again"}
{"text":"Over priced, small chicken pieces, batter tastes like nothing. I tried for the second and last time tonight, I just don't get what people see in the chicken here. To the people here who think this is 5 star chicken go check out KFC, you'll probably want to give it the Michelin Star!"}
{"text":"This place is more of a 3.5/5. I've only tried the chicken strips because my husband only likes white meat. I prefer dark and bone-in, as it has way more flavor. I want to come back and try the wings or thighs. Service here is not good, but that's not a deal breaker for me. 

The batter was light and not greasy. The gang jeong sauce was hot but not mouth burning. We also shared large fries with bulgogi seasoning, which was sweet and tangy. The large size fries was big enough for three people. 

I'd rate Wow Chicken as better than KFC, with a batter that parallels with Olive Chicken. The fries are better than Olive Chicken. For better quality chicken, nothing beats Cluck and Cleaver."}
{"text":"Fried chicken with a Korean flair.

What do I mean? You ever travel to a another country, and they have the same thing, but it's just...different? This is Wow Chicken. It's hard to explain, but like foreign travel, I enjoyed every second of it. 

Wow Chicken didn't seem like I was at a Korean restaurant in Canada - no, in fact it goes one further. Wow Chicken feels like you're at an American restaurant in Korea, in Canada. It has all the southern specialties like fried chicken, french fries, and Coca-Cola, but it's all just a little...different.

Some \"differences\":

- There's a 'fast food style' over-the-counter menu, but when I walked over to order from it, I was intercepted by a server, shown to a table, and given a menu. I still don't know what the counter is for.

-The asian style feel-good slogans like \"New Food New Happy!\" on the outside of the building, and \"It's Amazing Taste!\" on the menus.

- Being the only guy in the restaurant who had to drink Pepsi.  This made me laugh - I ordered a Coca-Cola, and was asked if Pepsi was ok. \"No problem\" I say, only to see other people drinking Coke. No, they didn't run out, the people who came in after me were allowed were allowed Coca-Cola Why couldn't I have one?? I feel like something got lost in translation...

- It's a classy looking place and confusingly so! With sleek looking rustic modern wood tables and walls, I found myself thinking \"this is a fried chicken joint?\"

All in all a fun experience with really tasty chicken!

Definitely check this place out, and write a review! I'm still a little confused by it, and I really want to hear what other people thought. Maybe you can shed some light on what, for me, may have been a little lost in translation.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I arrived in Calgary and wanted to try a quick spot for food. I decided to check this place out. If you are looking for parking, there's side street parking, but it's in quite a busy area of Kensington. The place was not crowded and the service was quick.

I ordered a half order of the Gang Jeong chicken with the spicy sauce. The half order was more than enough for just me. The chicken was very crispy! For being a fast food type of restaurant, the chicken was delicious! The spiciness from the sauce made my mouth water and was quite spicy, but it was so good. I would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to see this place in kensington growing, every time i walked by thinking of how amazing this new place will be.  For the few months its been in the making, its a huge dissapointment.  These people have put all their money into signs and napkins/trays/plates with their logo and branding, skipping the main thing : food.  They are right next to CPU  where I can get a massive slice of pizza for 3$ or a whole pizza for 12$, I went in here one day and checked the menu, ordered some wings for 15$.  Thats it people, 4 wings for 15$ - total ripoff.  The wings had the asian flavourings and were crunchy and fatty, but not worth it when I can head to any bar and get 10 cent wings all night.  I was expecting the wings to be so phenomenal that I'd have a heart attack ont he spot.  Sorry to dissapoint, they weren't."}
{"text":"I love the chicken here :) Would recommend if you are in the mood for some Korean fried chicken! My personal favourite is the fried chicken with the shallot on top and also the chili sauce one. I opt out to get the half half so I can eat both flavours :D

I don't particularly recommend the fries or the veggie tempura. Not that they are bad but I don't think they are anything amazing and I would rather fill my tummy with more chicken instead :D 

I like the cute little interior inside the restaurant. I also like that they serve Korean beer here. My only wishes are that they delivered and/or stayed open a bit later. Beer and chicken would be a pretty good late night meal with friends! 

Street parking in Kensington, it's always a bit of a struggle finding any but if you get lucky, you can park right in front of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Wow!
Delicious Korean chicken.  I'll come back here.  I don't get the haters.  This is no junk kfc, diharrea for days kind of food.  This is freshly cooked and yummy.   
I ordered a half of the original crispy and it was too much food.  
Good for sharing."}
{"text":"I've been here a numerous amount of times. The chicken is always fresh and delicious. It's never over cooked and very crispy! You must try all the sauces! They always play Korean music videos in the background which is always a plus if you're a KPop lover. :)"}
{"text":"I'm torn on this place. When it's good it's great, but when it's not it's awful. It can be the best chicken ever, but if the oil is old you can taste it and the service is better at you average fast food restaurant. 

Like many comments reflect, they treat you more like an inconvenience than a customer and maybe should simply switch to a drive up window if they don't appreciate dealing with the customer service aspect. 

Like the Soup Nazi on Seinfeld, it's like they expect you to appreciate paying them for the honor of eating the food, but the food isn't consistently awesome enough to tolerate the attitude."}
{"text":"I was in Calgary for the weekend in Oct. 2014. I was disillusioned with all of the suburban sprawl and icky American style corporate restaurants. So I went to Kensington and stumbled on Wow Chicken. 
This has got to be fried chicken nirvana. I had the Original wings one evening and they were so good I went back for lunch the next day! The 2nd time I had the breast strips. Also original, they were juicy, juicy inside and crunchy crispy outside. I don't know how they do it but the best fried chicken of 2014!
You can sit inside in a comfortable and tasteful dining room or do take-out. I think they also have some Korean staples on the menu but let me tell you, the chicken is what knocks it out of the park. You gotta try it if you are in Calgary. (Plus, Kensington is a cute older, leafy neighborhood that is enjoyable to walk around and window shop.)"}
{"text":"Came in at 9pm, rude and refused to serve us because they were closing at 10pm. Have enjoyed the food here before but this isn't the first time service has been lackluster. Will not be returning!

I should add that there are PLENTY of excellent places in town to get Korean fried chicken, and be treated with respect at the same time. Olive Chicken and Bonga come to mind."}
{"text":"We were still hungry after our breakfast of pastries so we were on the hunt for something more substantial. I spotted Wow Chicken and their sign advertising KFC lunch specials sounded perfect. 

We walked in and ordered a box to go. Interesting that they have a takeout window (no one was manning it). Interior is modern and they actually have cute, comfy looking seating. Service was a bit odd; I think the lady told us to wait at the front after we ordered but we just sat down at a table and waited there instead. 

- 3 piece drumstick meal ($9.99) - one of their lunch specials. Comes with fries and a pop. Chicken was fresh, moist and not too greasy. Batter was satisfyingly crispy and the fries were excellent.

3.5 stars. They have a second location in Chinatown. Interesting that both are nearby/beside Quickly's, not sure if there's a connection?"}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 stars.

Seems to be a Korean tradition, they sure know their fried chicken, even better than those Taiwanese nuggets at the bubble tea places, but I digress.

For $7.99, you sure can't beat the value, comes with regular fries and a can of pop, but feeling generous, I upgraded to the sweet chili fries, which was a terrific choice.  A good tang to it.

but of course, the highlight is the chicken; it's not as hard-crispy as KFC or Church's...a bit more tendier breaded skin...

Good atmosphere for a Sunday lunch, casual atmosphere with a bit of a modern decor.

no amex.

Friendly service, nice Korean server even asked how was it ;)

Liked the bench seating."}
{"text":"Ever since my favorite Korean burger joint (Giant Burger) turned into Olive Chicken, I've been hooked on Korean sweet and spicy chicken. 
So I thought I'd try Wow Chicken in Kensington for lunch since I'd heard they had lunch specials during the week.
My lunch date wasn't very hungry so we decided to share the special, which was 3 pieces of chicken breast served with fries and a soda for $8.99.  We upgraded to the sweet and spicy sauce (because why else would you have Korean chicken without it?!?) and also added Bulgogi seasoning to the fries.
The chicken came out hot and fresh, with the sticky glaze on the side for dipping. Now THAT is finger lickin' good!  The meat was \"basically boneless\", and we got three big pieces.  The seasoning on the fries was great too - subtle but had a nice sweet flair that made the regular fries rather special. I wish the special still came with the salad as pictured by former patrons on Yelp, but I still feel like it was a sweet deal.
Really nice restaurant on the inside, too - beat that KFC!"}
{"text":"Looking for something different yet the same to nom on this blistering hot summer day. I've been trying to go to wow chicken for a while now. 

I got me a Lunch Special; this consisted of 5pc wings with fries and a pop ($8.99). I opted to \"upgrade\" my fries to seasoned fries, I went for the bulgogi ($0.5) flavour. Service was quick as I was the only person there at the time, the restaurant was very clean and modern looking. Totally in love with their WOW chicken logo on... EVERYTHING. To me... its always the small details that count, and that'll always bring be back. I did find it a bit awkward to be sitting in the corner waiting for my food when there were so many empty seats around; I was happy enough watching the Korean MVs playing on the television there as a distraction though.

The food was steaming hot when I got in my car. The chicken was crispy and tender with every bite I could get down without burning myself. The coating of the chicken was very crunchy, but there was little to no seasoning to the chicken at all; quite bland. I think it would've tasted much better if it had sauce. Loved the bulgogi flavor on the fries, it was sweet and was a great change from \"unseasoned\" fries\".

Would come back on a regular basis if could find better free parking in the area..."}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for fried chicken - you can't do any better than WOW! Chicken!

This place ONLY makes fried chicken. (fries and a few pickles and things on the menu as well).

There is original recipe (think KFC but crispier, and more tasty), and their Korean spicy/sweet chicken as well as a few other flavours.

No nonsense, straight to the point restaurant that specializes in fried chicken!

Once you taste it, you'll be back again and again.

Decor is very nice. Trendy asian cafe style, service is pleasant.

I'll be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Got the lunch special - 3 piece chicken + fries + soda for $9.99. $1 extra is you want sauce.  I found the lunch portion to be smaller than expected. The chicken was pretty good, light and crispy on the outside and juicy inside.  Flavour wise,  it was a little bland but that can be fixed if you eat it with the sauce.  Highly recommend the soy garlic sauce! I'm not usually a big fan of fries but these fries were excellent."}
{"text":"Looking for some quick deep fried chicken that's a bit different from your regular KFC?  Well, that's what wow chicken is for.  Just ordered a boneless chicken meal with fries and pop.  Worked out to be just under $10.  Pretty good deal (ignoring twoonie Tuesdays at some other chicken vendor).  The taste isn't for everyone though.  It's a bit light on the flavor, and it's best to come with more than one person to order a bit more and share (though there really isn't any argument to leftovers).  Personally, I prefer the spicy gang-geong wings with a bit more flavor, but I don't mind the original recipe.  

They seem to put a lot of time in the esthetics of the place including place mats, plates, wet naps branded with the wow chicken logo.  I would be surprised if the bathroom also had toilet paper with the branding.  (Kidding!)

This place seems to see people in waves and can be a bit busy so just depends when you come by.  The Korean music videos are a nice touch and a nice change from Taylor Swift.  With the loss of Lido Cafe, it's nice to see another Asian establishment in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Compare to other fried chicken places out there, this restaurant offers good korean style fried chicken.  I don't understand why bad review. Anyways, I like this restaurant and I hope it lasts long enough that I can stop by when I feel like eating Korean style fried chicken. 

I hope my review doesn't annoy others since I am not one of those professional reviewers out there :p"}
{"text":"Every time I get chicken from here it's always in appetizing. Not quite what you would expect from a place that specializes in chicken. If you're on the hunt for some good fried chicken you'd probably have better luck at Mary browns."}
{"text":"It's a shame to what I'm going to have rate this place . To start off with the positives is that this place make some killer chicken . Probably one of the best I've had from a fast food restaurant.  Unfortunately the place isn't well maintained . Tables were sticky and dirty and the service takes forever . 

Another thing to point on that really irritated me was how rude the waitress were . And they expected a big tip . I ordered food that was worth 60 dollars with a group of friends and she literally  straight up said\" that's it ?\" You have to give us more and I gave a 6$ tip . That was way to generous considering what we got from the workers ."}
{"text":"Wow Chicken is awesome.

I came here with one of my friends on Friday, the 9th of October and was really impressed. Not a lot of people because we avoided the lunch/dinner rush but it's a really cool place with an okay atmosphere and it's awesome that they play Korean music videos on the TV while you eat, haha. 

We both got the boneless chicken meal which comes with fries, salad, and your choice of dressing. The fried chicken was fresh and tasty and awesome, the salad was good, and the fries. Holy crap. The fries are AMAZING here. You HAVE to get them. I know this is primarily a chicken place but you have not truly experienced Wow Chicken until you get their fries. Genuinely some of the best fries I have ever had in my life, if not THE greatest. I was craving those fries hours later still.

Portion size is big and I saw everyone who was eating there on Friday needed a box to do takeout for the rest, but whatever, it's so good. You'll be glad you took it home, even if the fries get soft in the box after.

This place's service is seriously fast too. We got our food (gigantic meal) in like 10 minutes max. Kinda wish they'd pour out the soda in glasses, but just in the can was adequate enough for me. Oh, and it's so cheap and affordable. The boneless chicken meal together with pop for me was around 11 dollars! That's insanely inexpensive.

I recommend you try this place out if you love fried chicken and fries. I definitely wanna come back!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant facilities. Clean and modern.  Service is prompt. Food came out quick. The fries are awesome. The chicken is good also but the fries are the star."}
