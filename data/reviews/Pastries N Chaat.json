{"text":"Having been to a few places where they supposedly serve  Indian delicacies in and around Phoenix, Scottsdale and Tempe, I had lost all hope that I'd be able to have good Indian snacks and chats in AZ. Until I walked into Pastries N Chaat that is...A friend took me there after one work one evening. I was circumspect because I did not want to be disappointed yet again. However, as I walked in, I could sense something positively different about this place. It had a pleasant, uncluttered, calm and soothing ambiance. They give you a slip where you can mark your order and take a seat. We ordered papdi chat, dahi batata puri, egg puffs, samosas and chai. The presentation of the food was excellent. The chats were fabulous with most of the flavors growing on you after every bite. The chai had great consistency and the samosas were hot and crispy too. The puffs had carrot in its filling which I personally did not like, but that wasn't really a put off. The price is pretty reasonable for the quantities that the serve. Mostly in the $3.00-$4.50 range. They have take outs too.  The service was excellent, the people were very courteous, friendly and polite. They have English pastries for those who'd like a bit of both. On the whole, I can't recommend this place enough. I'm sure to make many more visits."}
{"text":"It was great tbh best food it took them 5 to 7 minutes but the best quality for foods ever"}
{"text":"Place is little cramped but food is good.. I have tried vada pav and butter scotch pastrie. I ordered chicken Puff also but it is not hot.... They might forgot to heat it... Overall I like it and will try some other time"}
{"text":"Ordered Cake with a simple car design for my son's birthday party. But the cake delivered was with a totally different design. While ordering the cake, I gave a picture of a cake and asked the bakery guy to do a similar design on my cake order as well. First thing he couldn't do the design as evident from the cake he delivered. But the worst part is the arrogant attitude in claiming that the cake design he made is the actual one I ordered. The last thing I expected was an apology. Very disappointing, will never order a cake again at this place.   I really like the Biryani at this place and will keep going to this place for it, but will never buy a cake from this place. Attached pictures show what I ordered and what I got."}
{"text":"Not the friendliest service.. I placed my order and the man held out his hand for money. Didn't bother to tell me my total until I asked. Chicken biryani is mostly fat. Samosas nothing special. For 2 samosas and a small biryani to go was just a some change under 20 dollars. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"i went  again and i ordered pav bhaji and  biriyani was amazing taste.and the pineapple pastry also mind blowing.keep it up ."}
{"text":"Just had chats and cakes ...oh my god. Amazing food and the best indian food you can get in arizona.briyani is amazing..i live in tempe still i come to chandler just to have food @ pastries and chaat... thanks guys for your awesome quality and finger licking taste. I storngly recommend it. Best!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolute lack of respect for customer's time. I called this place for a take-out order and was told it'd be ready in 20 minutes. When I go there in 20 minutes, its not ready. Well, its fine, things happen and I pay for my order and wait for few more minutes. After 10 minutes, nothing, after 20 minutes, I check with them and get a response saying its getting ready. Now I see that folks that paid right in front of me (for dining in) get theirs served, while my order that was placed at least 20 minutes earlier (if not more) wasn't even started. Then the cashier explains to me that they prioritize dine-in orders than take-out orders. If they had told this to me earlier, I would either have not ordered a take out or preferred to dine in. The whole purpose of ordering in advance to save time is lost. Shame on them. And the cashier didn't see that its wrong to prioritize dine-in than take out orders."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with my manager and the food we got was awesome!! Cheap and tastey Indian street food. Hands down you must get Chicken Sukka , Samosa Chaat and Cut Mirchi.  When you arrive, it's hard to understand the menu on the wall, because there is absolutely no description of the items.  But just ask for the paper menus- I think there is better descriptions.  I am happy to find out they also have a location in scottsdale by my house- I will be going for sure!!"}
{"text":"I had the best biryani in the U.S. at this place. Mind you, it's pretty hot but very authentic. Their chaat and other dishes were extremely good as well. We were in Phoenix for a couple of days during our road trip and we went ther both the days.   If I am ever visit Phoenix, I am definitely goinf back to this place. 5/5 for food."}
{"text":"This place is great for Indian chaat but  price is  bit higher dan little India and the quantity is also less."}
{"text":"This review is just for the super tasty and satisfying Vijayawada biryani that I had.... sooo good. Great for quick Indian bakery snacks and chaat  and biryani items. It remands me of street food snacks and bakery in south India  Service is very good and friendly staff  Definitely a place to stop for an authentic Indian experience and well worth the price"}
{"text":"It's good place for Indian \"streetfood\" aka chaat items. The place is clean and service is quick too.  The biryani that is rice delicacies are good. Plus it's fairly cheap. The quantity is sometimes too less for one serving.  Best dish: Cut mirchi. It's Indian version of crispy chicken only with spicy jalapenos."}
{"text":"It's good only for snacks and cakes. Try avoiding any kind of biryani not upto mark and they have some weird biryani flavors."}
{"text":"Great place if you are craving something indian. Their chutneys have an authentic taste,  not to forget a cordial staff that most indian restaurants around the valley suck at.    I would not go there for a proper meal, coz they hardly have any but a light snack/pastry would be awesome.  Specially like the dahi batata puri,  samosa chat and paneer puffs."}
{"text":"Too expensive,  over rated and deserves no more then two stars!  Pani Puri and chat total bakwaas, waste of money!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to the newly re-opened restaurant. The food was very good and we enjoyed all of the chaat selections we ordered. I will say that service was very slow and the food took a while to come out. But I am hoping that was due to their inexperience and that they will get more efficient. This is a nice option to have in this area and I am hopeful that their business will make it."}
{"text":"Our family of four just stopped in based on the high ratings here on Yelp. We were not disappointed. The staff was very helpful in explaining items, made a dish for my husband that's not normally available tonight, and put out some terrific tasty chaat, other appetizers, pizzas, and dessert!!  We will definitely be back for great food at great prices!!"}
{"text":"Compared with all the restaurants in Phoenix, AZ biryani here is decent. The Indian restaurants in Phoenix are not that good compared to other cities. So do not expect best Indian food anywhere in Phoenix if you already been to other places in usa."}
{"text":"Authentic Indian cuisine at its best. And some Americanized delights with authentic Indian taste.  Very clean restaurant, great customer service, I will certainly be back to try one of everything."}
{"text":"Best Biryani in town!!!  Clean relaxed atmosphere. Extremely prompt friendly Staff. The pastries are delicious!! Very impressed!!! Thank you!"}
{"text":"One of the worst place We ordered two biryani when we checked at home it was only one biryani I box"}
{"text":"Pretty fast in getting the food ready and food tastes pretty good. The cakes are also good but the interior is not very welcoming and we mostly do take out here."}
{"text":"I liked this pastries n chat than the one on bell road. This one has nice ambiance and service is very good. I liked the puffs, veg special and pastries. I had only once bad taste of Biryani but i tried again next time which was good. over all it is good."}
{"text":"Poor Service. Customer receiving is very bad. They feel why has this customer come to restaurant sort of thing. I usually go very often, but restrained myself going these days.  Previously there was another staff serving which was good. Now staff are thumbs down."}
{"text":"Had samosa ,chai and Dahi batata puri. Really good. Food was authentic,decor nice and service great. Nice little place for a meal or snack"}
{"text":"Starters are fine. Biryani is not so great, ulavacharu biryani is little decent. Ambience little good but if you wanted to eat good biryani then better choose other options."}
{"text":"Busy for lunch, decent ambience and food. Not disappointing, food and little spicy, I had veg thali."}
{"text":"A weekend special 'Raju gari pulav' turns out to be a coriander rice with some spices. A disaster!!"}
{"text":"It's hard for me to find a chaat place that I really like, so I was excited to try this one out since it recently opened up in the area. The decor was decent, and overall the place looked clean. We ordered chicken puffs, samosa chaat,  papdi chaat, and tiramisu. The portions were super tiny, yet still the food was pretty expensive! We came in for dinner and one chaat per person was not enough.   The samosa chaat seemed good in flavor, but there was only one samosa and it wasn't even a decent size. There was also a huge lack of chickpeas, which is essential to any chaat. After searching in our dishes, we found that the average amount was 2 chickpeas per dish! There also weren't a lot of onions or solid food, so at times it was kind of like eating chutney with a spoon. Plus there was so little that I finished it in less than 5 minutes, still hungry for more.  The papdi chaat looked yummy, although, again, it was a small portion. The first bite was fine, but after a few more I found it to be inedible. The ratio of papdi to chutney was not good at all, and my mouth started hurting from chomping down the crunchy and dry dish. After a while, I gave up and stopped eating.  The tiramisu was okay... it seemed soggy but was still better than the rest of the meal. The chicken puffs were okay as well. They were small in size and were not anything to write home about. They garnished the dish with potato chips, which were quite obviously store bought. The service was slow as well.  By the end of the meal, I was nauseous and bloated without even eating much at all. The next day, my stomach was upset and so was I. For some reason, the place was doing pretty well and it wasn't that empty. Not sure what people see in this place. Never coming back!"}
{"text":"Went this afternoon with family. Place is still new and they still seem to be figuring out the operational stuff in the meanwhile expect quite a bit of chaos,  possibly spoilt food and confusing service  We ordered Paav bhaaji, sev puri and paani puri.  Paav bhaaji was ok and paani puri potatoes were spoilt.   Ok, have to leave now.  The fire alarm just went off accidentally and chaos rules. In the meanwhile i get 10% off as an apology for the rotten potatoes in the paani puri.   Doubt this place will be around in 6 months and will not miss it either."}
{"text":"Tried Bhel poori - seemed some ingredients are missing but tasted okay! Then comes Dahi poori - there was not much of sweet tamarind chutney recognizable in it but they made it sweet whisking yogurt with sugar, but tasted good and mouthful, soft and sweet ! I would revisit this place to try out their other chaats !"}
{"text":"Been to this new place couple of times already, the food is good, Neat and clean location with a decent service."}
{"text":"We have eaten at this new restaurant twice in the last week. The food is excellent and in a great location. The staff is very helpful and welcoming. We are so glad they opened this restaurant in our neighborhood.  By the way, they also sell the most amazing pastries to include eggless pastries."}
{"text":"Hi .. These guys are selling Frozen paranthas of DEEP brand and ready to eat currys which are available in plenty at any Indian grocery shop at much lower rate  .But our purpose is to get freshly cooked food which is not available here as they are selling heated frozen stuff.   I thnk any Indian living abroad can recognize these paranthas and curry by their shape and color , taste itself.  My suggestion is to them , they should put some effort and cook fresh and stop selling frozen stuff at least."}
{"text":"Have been here multiple times. Always enjoy eating chat. Try their veg biryani. Its one of the best up and down the Bell Rd Indian food."}
{"text":"We have visited these place couple of times and had Egg Biryani. Excellent biryani with the right spices and vegetables. Like carry out option."}
{"text":"This is my hangout place when i feel like eating biryanis, indian snacks or pastries. Price is reasonably good and best place to have indian snacks in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"The food is decent, but too pricey especially for the student crowd. It is not worth the price as the quantity is less. The pastries are very soft and tasty. The pineapple pastry is very delicious.  But the pricing should definitely be reviewed by the management, in comparison to the other Indian restaurants around Tempe and Mesa."}
{"text":"The food was excellent! The price is very reasonable. The ambience is great. The service is excellent.  We ate bhelpuri PAC baji and vegetarian thali. All the items were good. The quantity was a lot."}
{"text":"Just had a wonderful lunch here. Ordered the samoas chaat and the vindaloo curry special.  Both were excellent,  full of flavor!  Vindaloo was spicy like we like it but owner was nice enough to warn us if we were not spicy people. Our boys were acting up while waiting for the food and they brought us little pieces of cake to help occupy them. I appreciated that greatly. We ordered a chicken tikki pizza for the kids and we both loved it. Prices are right and it's the perfect fit for when I'm craving indian food. A neighborhood gem."}
{"text":"The food is okay but not great. The mango lassi was good but besides that I really didn't like the desserts. One of the fried desserts tasted like it was made with rancid oil."}
{"text":"Tried boneless biryani today..its not at all good as compare to biryani on the other location on east bell road.Please learn from them"}
{"text":"I have been to Pastries n Chaat on Northsight Blvd a couple times as this restaurant is near my house. Their food is very good, a bit on the spicy side, so ask for mild if heat is an issue for you. I have had their biriyanis mostly, but will try other items soon.  The staff is friendly and courteous. I have not tried their pastries, but they look good behind their glass case."}
{"text":"We ordered a take out of 3 plates  chilly paneer from here on a Saturday night,which was very slow at their restaurant. They had no lol at all, only a small bday party going on.paneer chilly  had no salt no green pepper no onions , paneer was hard not even fried. Lot of red color added . It just seemed like they had cut n colored those paneer cubes for some sabji , and serving size was way too small too . So disappointed from pastries n Chaat , our first n last visit . No value of money. On top of tip the waiter made a big frown when we chose no tip option after they made us wait for such a long time just for one dish .  Think twice before ordering a take out from there"}
{"text":"Wonderful chili pizza and paneer special! Great service. I would definitely recommend and return here."}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE EVER. I ordered the Paneer Tikka Masala with extra bread over the phone as a to-go order and they said it would be ready in 20 min. I go there 25 minutes after the call and when I got there the service was the WORST (I work in customer service). Not only did I have to wait an extra 50 minutes to receive my paneer tikka since I paid, but the cashier asked if I could dine in instead, because the food was ready (even though I waited an extra 20 after). I said no because I had to leave awhile ago, and they gave me the paneer tikka PIZZA (no extra bread) and insisted I had ordered that. At that point I was so annoyed and took my food and left. Normally I don't have issues in Tempe, but this Pastries and Chaat sucks. I was the ONLY person in the restaurant. Pizza was also soggy."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service   We ordered a paneer tikka masala at this place. We were served chicken tikka instead and we are vegetarians. I went and told the guy in charge and he just started smiling. I told him we are vegetarians and you should be careful. I understand this type of mistake can happen , but worst part was the guy was so unapologetic and arrogant. We felt really bad and am never going to this place again !"}
{"text":"Food is amazing taste really good!!! Staff is friendly and willing to explain what you order. Prices are reasonable and affordable"}
{"text":"This place blew away my expectations. Thus is my new regular spot for Indian food, hands down."}
{"text":"Great service. Biryani is really good, biryani lovers should give a try.. wide variety of chats and pastries."}
{"text":"They screwed up the spice level and couple of us choked - the manager came back saying they wouldn't replace the order and all the biryani batches will have the same spice level - worst part WITHOUT ANY REGRET!!  Bad service and please understand customers are not looking for free food!!   Shameful......"}
{"text":"I ordered catering services for my son's 2nd birthday. Food was amazing.. Chicken Biryani and Chicken Sukha were top of the list. Price is decent and quantity of the food is adequate. Every guest enjoyed and appreciated the food. Chef Anandan was really pleased to talk with and he delivered what he promised.   Let me tell you about Pastry Cake. The best cake i ever had in my life. I used to like pastries back in india but i never Tasted this type of pastry cake in my life. We ordered a full sheet for just 40 guests and cake vanished at the end of the party. I had to save it for my self for next day.   I really liked about the whole experience, i would order and recommend to my friends.   PnC is the best indian restaurant in Phoenix. Keep rocking and keep up with the great food and quality."}
{"text":"Hi,  Today we went this restaurant and ordered veg and chicken puff and some sweets. It's totally old food, not able to eat anything. Not worth for the money. I will never visit this place again.  Dear Chat and Pasteries,  You guys provided wonderful food , after getting familiar your food quality totally waste. Please consider the money what u are getting and provide quality food."}
{"text":"Ahhhh the aroma when you walk in the door.   Don't be fooled by a little store front in a strip mall.  This is the real deal.   I ordered a puff and vada pav. It was all amazing.   Will definitely be back. Pleasant and clean atmosphere and very courteous staff."}
{"text":"Attention foodies: try this place!  We had the Samosa Chat, Chicken Puffs and Chicken Briyani.  The flavors were excellent and unique.  The foods is spicy but delicious.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"It's good that they opened closed to my home , but food taste ok but not good , I took samosa chat I felt like eating Chana curry it doesn't taste like a chat , so I get its not at all Indian chat it's an American chat"}
{"text":"My first visit won't be my last because that's how impressed I am with this new business. They have redefined freshness while offering a variety of popular Indian street food and desserts. It's the next \"NEW THING\" and everyone must try. I wish your team the very best AND see you soon!"}
{"text":"We are new to Phoenix and Scottsdale area and we were trying out different eateries around this place, and we went to try this place to try their samosas and it was really good."}
{"text":"They had great taste when they started out. Off-late their taste needs improvement. Indian food especially is well cooked. Last time I tasted their Veg Biriyani it had raw hot spices that frustrated us than let us enjoy the taste. Otherwise their Chaat items are good. If they work on the finishing up a little bit, they should be one of the good ones in the city."}
{"text":"Very tasty chaat! The Dahl Batata Puri was perfect for kids. Not to mention the delicious desserts! I know this is meant to be snacks but we made a dinner of it."}
{"text":"One of the best places to have Hyderabadi food in Chandler . The biryanis are good and spicy . Service is fast . The also have some good chaat , if you are not a biryani fan . Must try out if you are in the area ."}
{"text":"Been to this branch a few days ago. We had the chicken puff and boneless chicken Briyani it tasted good especially their chicken puff was awesome !!"}
{"text":"Been here couple of times for Chaat and Bakery food items and they taste Okay. I tried Briyani here last week and was very disappointed and because of this i will be giving 1 star. Not sure whether the cook knows to make Briyani or not. Stronly recommend not to order Briyani in this restaurant."}
{"text":"Ordered goat biryani and gongura chicken biryani. They are very delicious and service is very good"}
{"text":"Finally some real Indian food in Tempe. This is going to be my all time favorite place. The taste of chaat and biryani is so authentic and very close to what you get in India. Im already addicted to dahi batata puri and dum biryani. Lots of other options to try too such as pav bhaji, sev puri and wada pav. Prices are reasonable and serving quantity is quite good.  Ambiance is modern and pleasant unlike other Indian restaurants. Friendly n fast service. Definitely recommend this place if you want fast, tasty n yummy Indian food.  Way to go pastries n chaat! I hope you open more restaurants."}
{"text":"The best place for biryani and sweets.   The service is exceptionally awesome.    Snacks are also really good"}
{"text":"Loved everything weve tried.  They are so very helpful and explain in detail all the different menu items.  Pastries are fantastic.  We'll be regulars!"}
{"text":"On Sunday March 05,2017 We ordered the jumbo veg value meal for 39.99 along with few other items. Transaction no. 011802.   Total value $79.20  I was very specific about food being vegetarian as the guest we had on that day don't even eat egg or cake with egg etc. in other words the food had to be strictly vegetarian.  To our guest' surprise there were chicken pieces in veg biryani and the entire evening was spoilt for us and our guest. Totally disappointed.  The quality seems to go down once the popularity increases I guess.  We stopped going to bawarchi for same reason and looks like another one in the making."}
{"text":"Service is too slow. It took more than 40 mins to get samosa out. If you are looking for quick snacks, look elsewhere"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time, after reading a good review. But I am very disappointed! The food was horrible! The vegetable curry was so sweet and had 2 small pieces of paneer! Will never go back to this place again!! Much much better Indian eating joints here in the valley guys! Try those!"}
{"text":"love this restaurant, authentic indian food that's more of a fast sit down lunch or dinner place. I love the desserts."}
{"text":"Nice ambience and good food Close from my house Good customer service Mutton sukka was really awesome. Good quantity on the biryani Affordable prices Overall a very good experience I would recommend this place to my friend"}
{"text":"Horrible experience.. this is the second time and last time... Don't know what are people doing here or running this restaurant. A vada pav order takes 40mins to reach your table ... There were 6 tables occupied and none of them had anything on their table.. horrible service"}
{"text":"do not go with their discounts or offers .biryani is so poor and old which is waste of money and not satisfied with the quality of their food"}
{"text":"This is one of the worst Indian restaurant in Arizona,the quality of food is very bad (old).i felt like throwing up after having the chicken puff that was served to me ,please don't try any Indian sweets and cakes here my daughter ordered laddos they were fully frozen will never come to this place again"}
{"text":"Me and my husband like the boneless chicken biryani from here.its very tasty and spicy. We have tried samosa chat ,samosa,vada pav,dahi batata puri,chicken tikka pizza , everythig is good and reasonably prized. In main course we have tried non beg combo,vijaywada biryani,keema biryani,fish biryani. Loved all of these.their pastries are soft moist and yummy too. I would highly recommend if anyone wants to try chat and biryanis and pastries. We ordered our daughter's birthday cake. With frozen theme from here.it was expensive but very very tasty.my daughter still talks about her cake how yummy it was. Service is good and staff is good and helpful."}
{"text":"We had dinner here tonight - 2 of us split a chicken biryani as well as 2 appetizers (can't remember the names). It was plenty for us and was very delicious! Quite spicy! We also shared a fantastic layered pistachio cake - YUM! The staff was super helpful and friendly!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time for lunch the other day, the first thing I noticed was that the sit down restaurant was very clean! Great customer service in the front, very polite and patient while explaining the menu!  Food turned out wonderful!"}
{"text":"Fast, cheap, delicious!! I came here bc paradise valley burger across the street is closed on sundays and now im glad they were. I was hungry and wanted something fast, cheap and delicious and this place did it!! Friendly service, i asked what they recommend and the gent suggested a samosa chaat. By the time i came out of the bathroom my food was redy and it looked like a abstract painting. So many colors, textures and flavors, it really surprised me!! For $6 i walked out full and satisfied!! As for the pastries, they gave me a cpl cake samples and they were good, but nothing special, good flavor but jus seemed like regular american sponge cake. I will def be coming back to try some more food!!!"}
{"text":"As delicious as it gets! Paneer 65, Egg Biryani and Paneer Biryani were all as delicious as can be! If you're looking for Hyderabadi Biryani, this is place to go to.   Menu: Wide ranging menu with dishes that are rare to find in the US such as Irani Samosa, Paneer tikka pizza, chilli paneer pizza, lots of chaat items (try the dahi batata puri), pastries, Indian sweets etc.   Service: Although this is a fast casual place, the service is very good. The food is always presented very well and packed very nicely for to go orders. The waitress even brought our four year old a small bowl with less spicy Biryani rice just because she overheard my wife tell him that it's too spicy for him.   Speed: Knowing that it takes a good amount of time to make delicious Indian food, I'll say that they're pretty fast.   Price: The taste and presentation are upscale but the price isn't. Most of the menu is reasonably priced, especially the Biryanis with generous portions.   P.S: My previous experience at this location is evidently a one off experience. The Tempe location is just as good as the Chandler one. In fact, the Biryanis are better than ever."}
{"text":"Wow!! Finally an Indian bakery! Haven't seen anything like this in my five years in Phoenix.  The freshly made pastries are easily as good as the best in India. The paneer puff was top notch too. I also liked the paneer tikka pizza.   Wide selection of hard-to-find Indian food in the valley. Bengali sweets and lots of other Indian sweets looked tempting.   I liked the simple ambiance too, it gave me a feel of India. Although it's a self service place, the owners who ran the place were friendly and helpful.   Service wasn't lightning fast but the food was easily worth the short wait."}
{"text":"Wide variety of authentic Indian food that's hard to get in the valley!"}
{"text":"Our first visit was wonderful! I had the weekends-only Goat Dum Biryani. It was a mountain of fragrant rice with a generous large helping of simmered spicy goat, perfect sauce on the side. We could quite finish it, and it is delicious as leftovers. My partner had the Non-Vegetarian Thali, which was gorgeous and yummy. Like an Indian Bento box! It had rice, sauces, curried meat, and a dessert serving. Perfect!  The place was not too crowded. They have an ethnically diverse customer base, which I always enjoy. The service was helpful, patient, and generous. We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Biryani and samosas were incredible. Portion was large but I'd definitely say the prices were $$ not $. Water tasted like tap.  Otherwise, incredibly good food!"}
{"text":"Excellent fast food Indian place. Highly recommend. Try the chicken 65. Good music! Very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Excellent street food type Indian food.  Just the right amount of heat!  The sauce was so good, wanted to ask for more to take home.  Don't forget to leave room for sweets!  The cake is delish, but I really want to go back to try lemon moons.  Looking forward to my next visit already!"}
{"text":"This is a nice new joint. I really like that they are not like the other 'typical' indian restaurants in the valley. A very trendy menu and interior. I like their Vada Pav, Chaat and Panner pizza they are I guess the best in the valley. Pastries looked really tempting, we did not try it but, will do so next time as we had a heavy meal. Their lunch options are limited with one veg and one non-veg curry. But I think that works out for a fast food Indian joint if they want to stay away from the other buffet places. We will go there again for Pastries this week."}
{"text":"Great to see they opened another location in North Scottsdale. Just went there the other day and had a few of their chaat items and veg biryani. Delicious. Anyone looking to sample Indian snack items and dessert should definitely give this place a shot."}
{"text":"The food here is great. I don't have a lot of experience with Indian food, but from a culinary standpoint the food is cooked perfectly every time I have been there. Excellent choice for food in this area."}
{"text":"Delicious food! We tried samosas, samosa chaat, cut mirchi, Kati chicken roll, mango lassi and pepper goat. All was delicious! Looking forward to ginger goat!"}
{"text":"Am frequent to Scottsdale branch but Sunday we don't have it opened. So we visited Bell Rd branch. I have high expectations for this location as it should be the main branch. I am disappointed with the ambience firstly and the jalebi I ordered tastes oily. However I put the stars for their biryani and the quantity they offer.   They can actually improve on the sweets section. But still I would try this place for their chat variety and the pastries :-)"}
{"text":"This is a must try place for their snacks and biryani menu. I have tried them and would definitely recommend this place. One will not regret the taste for the price they quoted . This is a new branch in Scottsdale and I have never visited their bell rd store. However, You don't get the indian sweets here .only available are few pastries option ."}
{"text":"Great place for quick inexpensive Indian street food for lunch. They also have a plethora of Indian pastries. I have no clue what Subba ordered for me but it was like a fried chicken, spicy rice with a hidden drumstick inside, lentil soup, naan, and some beef thing. I also tried some of the pastries. They were sweet and delicious (the almond one was the best). I'll come back after I eat this roll of tums from the spicy!"}
{"text":"I visited this Indian restaurant with family on last weekend and it was very nice dinner. They quoted many varieties both veg and meat. I liked the goat biryani. When it comes to chat I liked dahi puri most of all. I feel like pleasure writing review to this food place. I recommend all food lovers to visit once. Thanks"}
{"text":"Well, that was disappointing.  I love samosa chaat, and I understand that there are differences in the prep depending on where you get it, but this just wasn't very good.  The chicken biriyani was pretty good until my husband bit into a spice of some sort and spent the next 5 minutes gagging at the table.  He said it was a stick of some sort.  Don't know what it was or what its called.  All I know is that after that I didn't want any more biriyani.  Service was not super, but we were there close to closing so I'll be kind and chalk it up to that.  I might come back and try something else.  The Indian pizza sounded interesting.  They had chicken tikka masala and paneer masala, either of which would be really good on Indian flatbread.  I just won't be doing a repeat of today's experience.  And I'll get it to go so I'm not stuck paying a rapey $2 a piece for cans of Coke.  That was pretty much the crowning glory of my lunch.  Two bucks for a CAN of Coke in a restaurant? Really? Really?! On second thought, I may not go back just for that reason! I read the reviews on Yelp before trying  and I am forced to ask--are we eating at the same place?"}
{"text":"My chicken tikka lunch dish some how reminds me of a $3 dollars TV dinner. Except it's $7 and it was not frozen. Tasty but the portion of the curry is laughable. The white sauce is only there to make this dish feel like it is worthy of the $7 bucks! My recommendation will be to replace the white salad source with real green salad!"}
{"text":"My coworkers took me to this spot and I was instantly hooked! I loved the chicken biryani so much that I brought my family back here the following week. Upon our return we tried the tandoori pizza and WOW it was amazing! The pizza takes a while to make but it is totally worth it. The decor and cleanliness are on point here as well. If there is any room for improvement I'd say maybe answering the phone, I've tried calling in an order multiple times and the phone never works. We will DEFINITELY be back!"}
{"text":"Pretty annoyed that I drive all the way here for dinner and they are closed. It's Wednesday at 5:10pm. Yelp says you're open Monday-Thursday from 4:30-9:00pm. Your website says you're also opened. Your door says you're also opened. But no. There's no note or sign saying why you're closed. The door is locked and no one is answering the phone. I came out of my way in rush hour traffic for nothing! So mad."}
{"text":"Was not fond,of the place the staff was friendly, tho the bf, and I order to supposedly different plates, for them to be the same, with one different component, and very bony, I don't like eating rice and getting little bites of bone in every bite, youch!"}
{"text":"This place has changed for the worst in the past year. The very limited menu is weak, especially when they don't have half the food actually on the new menu available. Sad to see a great Indian restaurant turn into a fragment of what it once was. A take out order took over 45 minutes after being told it would take 15.  I won't be back!  (I first went to their new location on Happy Valley and they didn't really have any of the food on the menu they had posted available.)  I don't see either location around in a year. They may be good at catering, but they don't need the overhead to do that."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times. First time the Pav Bhaaji was really good. But second time it was too hot and spicy.  The pastries were good both the times. I also tried the chicken burger... somehow the combination of mint chutney with lettuce isnt that great in the burger. I would say get rid of either the mint chutney or the lettuce in the burgers. But overall the burgers tasted very good...  I also had lunch here once and it was okay. Overall... I feel the place is good but they need to be more consistent."}
{"text":"So not worth it. The paneer in paneer kathi roll was all burnt which tasted bitter. Also, samosa chaat was very salty. Never going to visit again."}
{"text":"Great food, amazing and friendly staff, good value for money. Appropriately located close to the university, convenient for a quick bite as well as a sumptuous meal."}
{"text":"Excellent Biriyani! The chicken had wonderful flavor and a good amount of spice level to it. The portion was huge -  could feed a small family. The chicken puff, while tasty, was cold in the middle though so that was disappointing. Still giving it 5 stars for the originality of the menu and friendliness of the man in the kitchen. Register guy though? Not so much...Would definitely go back next time I'm in Scottsdale again."}
{"text":"I've been looking forward to try this place.  Love the restaurant. ..very modern and casual. Not a lot of sitting, but all the necessary.  Food...i was craving gobi aloo, though they didn't have it, they were able to cook for me a very nice vegetables curry, with cauliflower. ..it was yummy! Rice was perfectly cook, yogurt sauce - raita-  was superb.... only thing was \"different was the bread, im used to Naan. ..and  they serve it with Paratha, which was ok, just different.  I will be back for sure...and by the way, their pastries look awesome, didnt get to try them, but i will *)"}
{"text":"Our Sunday dinners has been pretty much pastries n chaat's boneless chicken biryani for the past year. Need I say more? There has been some mishaps over the year, ofcourse, no establishment is perfect but it seems like they really do care about their business. Enough to be apologetic to their customers instead of rude when things get a little crazy. The SO is picky to say the least, and the fact that we go here every Sunday is a big deal. I've taken several friends here and they've all enjoyed their food despite their varying tolerances to spicy foods. Needless to say, you don't get patrons or regulars for nothing. Food, crew, place and location is great."}
{"text":"Cool little Indian Place with limited menu but way less expensive than any other place I've been too."}
{"text":"I loved it. I had a dessert that was fantastic, and I'll be back for lunch sometime soon. The restaurant is very clean and nice. Staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Just not great food. Confusing menus --two different menus and then a third behind the register.  Overpriced--fish biryani had a few small over cooked pieces of fish and lots of rice.  For $13.  Lots of fried foods if that is what you want."}
{"text":"These guys are from Hydrabad India. Pretty great food good spice. We ordered chicken masala and biryani, which I was told was hot and actually was   Next time ordering samosa chaat. Pistachio pastries was a great finish. Great value very good food."}
{"text":"We ordered ulavacharu and dum biryani .the food is not fresh and even the plates in which they serve the food are not strong.will not visit again .phoenix need some good indian restaurants."}
{"text":"They serve wonderful biryani. The serving is good and the service is excellent particularly the Scottsdale location."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try this place out for a long time and finally got a chance to visit. We ordered chaat even though they do have some meals like different kinds of biriyanis and combos. we ordered samosa chaat and sev puri and they were very good. Reminded me of chaat from back home. So glad there is finally a decent chaat place in scottsdale. You must definitely visit this place if you're craving chaat."}
{"text":"Was so excited to see pastries and chaat so close to home! I have been to the other branch several times, so today finally went to this one and they did not dissapoint.  Their chaat is to die for and so is their biriyani. Do check them out for authentic indian food!"}
{"text":"Pav Bhaji, Vada Pav and Samosa Chat taste was very bad. Vada Pav and Samosa is like only patato and Bhaji is like normal Bhaji."}
{"text":"09/15 Picked up few pastries and chilli chicken pizza. As usual this is the only and the best place where you get great pastries in the valley. Kids love the pastries and samosa. Recommed this place for pastries and authentic chat."}
{"text":"I would like to give this place five stars. The food is excellent and the staff are pleasant. However, they are horribly understaffed for a busy evening. I called in a take out order, which was supposed to be ready in 20 minutes. I showed up there on time, yet waited an additional 30 minutes at the restaurant for the only chef who is there to prepare my food. There were several additional angry customers who are also waiting for the food. In addition, the food comes out piecemeal, so if you were eating there, your food will not come out at once making a very disjointed dinner experience. I would strongly recommend the owners hire at least one more chef to work on the weekends so people don't have such a terrible experience."}
{"text":"Just got 2 chicken biryani but really disappointed with food no spice at all even mentioned spicy while ordering and chicken pieces look like yesterday's chicken not fresh one at all. Maybe serve morning biryani in the evening"}
{"text":"Came in to order food there was a customer just leaving the counter as I stepped forward the person behind the counter  turned away from me and stepped into the back and even though I waited they didn't come back even though they saw me."}
{"text":"I tried an entree, chaat and pastry from this place. Each gets a 10. The chicken dum biryani was the most authentic and delicious one I've had at any restaurant in the US in my 11 years here. Chaat was really tasty too and My wife tried their pineapple cake which she really liked. Service was friendly and fast and it had a fun ambience playing Punjabi music. Don't miss out!"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious. I love dahi puri, pepper chicken, Apollo fish and ginger chicken. That tall cashier guy is very polite as well."}
{"text":"Poor customer service and take out actually had a different dish altogether.. food was average with chicken at times tasting stale .. overall with multiple other choices around for Take out Indian food ... would go elsewhere"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to check this place out for a long time and finally made it a point to come by and pay them a visit. It is really close to our house and I needed a new place to chill.  This is both a small restaurant and a good looking custom cake and pastries sanctuary. Check out their photos to see all of the delicious cakes and sugary yummies that they make.   Inside is small with a menu that can be navigated with a scratch of a pencil on an ordering card. I got the impression that you place the order at the counter and they bring it to your table. Nothing fancy or sophisticated. Just fresh food with some tasty desserts to finish off your meal.  The menu has a few combo plates, several appetizers, a few pizzas with some hip flavors and another specialty called Chaat. Many of their dishes are designed for those who are on a meat free diet and actually taste very good. They even have some cool daily specials.  Ordered some meatless Samosa Chaat for a starter and was amazed on how good it tasted. The combination of textures and flavors were delightful. Next ordered a Chicken Tikka Pizza. My stomach was hungry and I needed a little more to eat. The pizza was a fusion of of flavors from India and Italy and served hot and fresh.  Ordering was a bit confusing at first and the place looked like they got slammed the night before. Will definitely come back and try out some of their other items on the menu. The desserts in the display cases looked amazing. ORDER UP!  4 STARS"}
{"text":"worst service!! People inside say its closing time even if we go at 8:30  even though it says 9 and lets us take only togo and doesn't give all the items paid for saying everything is done while delivering. Doesn't even say that in a polite manner."}
{"text":"Tried bhel puri, samosa and egg puff. Average indian taste. While i was waiting one customer was complaining about the extra salt in the his food."}
{"text":"Best in Chandler for Fast food. Chef Anand makes Chikken Sukka the best. Felt like eating in road side Dhaba in India"}
{"text":"This place was very disappointing. Service was extremely poor. I made a straight forward order: vada pav. 10-15 minutes later they tell me they can't make it and tell me to order something else. I didn't want anything else and they made a big production out of giving me a refund. My wife tried their pani puri and it was below average.  Just a few miles away is Little India at the corner of Baseline and McClintock and the food is much better with better service."}
{"text":"I just tried chicken boneless biriyani with my coworkers. The rice and chicken were flavorful and delicious. The rice was a bit spicy, but I typically don't each spicy food. Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. I also tried a piece of butterscotch cake, which was amazing. Moreover, the customer service was wonderful! My belly is appeased! I look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"I mostly get either dahi chat or vijaywada biryani . Recently their biryani was extremely spicy even after asking for medium spicy . This happened three times even after complaining about their spice level . My toddler loves to eat this biryani but because of their spice level I can't even feed him :( ."}
{"text":"Bugs in food... we ordered pav bhaji and when started having bread... found bug and it was alive. It flied out from the bread. Wondering how the kitchen cleanliness is!!! I have been to this place from years... now it's almost done."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and try the chaats. We have had better Indian entrees for sure, but the chaats are inexpensive and incredibly tasty. Samosa chaat and papdi chaat are where it's at. My boyfriend raves about the papdi chaat and gets random cravings for it. So glad we finally tried the chaats even though we were a bit wary.  While the chaats are vegetarian and we are not, they are quite filling and don't leave you craving meat."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely great. I got rice with bone in chicken! It was a little spicy but you can always ask for less spice. The people here were very nice to us and were willing to help us with the menu options! Come try it!!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful, tasty, and quick Indian food! We popped in on a Friday night and had a delicious dinner. I had the samosa chaat and my partner had the chicken biryani, both were delicious. Each was full of wonderful Indian spices, and it was all very satisfying and filling without being greasy or heavy. The people working there were very nice and service was fast. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing place for an evening tea and snacks... My and my better half come here quite often, almost every week... Its a fun little place and the guys there are very customer friendly.. Not to mention, the place is very clean n tidy...  OK now coming to the food, the chaats are delicious, helps us from missing home too much... Good tea and vada paav... Pastries are indian style which you cannot find anywhere else in phoenix...  Summary for the lazy to read - good place, nice food."}
{"text":"GORGEOUS food! I'm saying the FLAVOR is gorgeous. And, yes, beautifully prepared, too.  I live in the far northern part of the Valley and have never even been down this way after 20 years up there. But you can be sure this place is worth a friggin' PILGRIMMAGE!"}
{"text":"Amazing all the way around. Great food, friendly staff, clean restaurant. The tikka pizza is my favorite, it's a must try!"}
{"text":"The food was very ordinary and does not seem hygienic. We had upset stomach after eating here."}
{"text":"Walked into the restaurant around noon... The place was empty. We walked up to the counter to order food. While ordering, the gentlemen proceeded to tell us certain things on the menu weren't available for an hour or so. They were being delivered from another store. So we ordered from what they had. We had Dahi papdi, chilli paneer, and pani poori... they all tasted delicious. I really wanted some Pav Bhaji, but they didn't have any. The guy kept telling us to get what they had, which we weren't interested it. The gentleman was even a little creepy. The food was okay, but the service could get better."}
{"text":"Amazing tikka and puffs. And everything I'm sure is outstanding. Real real G's of the Indian cuisine"}
{"text":"I frequently visit this place.. they have different types of indian food - chaat, hyderabadi biryanis,  manchurians n lunch specials/combos for north/south indian food items. It is more of a fast food model"}
{"text":"This place has so good chaat that even though we are close to the Chandler location, we drive all the way to Tempe. Also, recently we ordered catering food for a Christmas party and asked for some modifications. We were very happy that they listened to us and everybody loved their food! We also like how Dinesh the store manager interacts with customers. It is well pleasing to see a welcome smile when we enter the restaurant. I highly recommend others to try them for catering Indian food especially the non veg stuff."}
{"text":"Sorry to say. Really expected something nice looking at the menu. Unfortunately nothing tastes good. Chaat served was soggy. Dum biryani is definitely not authentic. Service could also be improved. Gulab jamun served cold.  I just wish they could improve as they have a unique menu."}
{"text":"Amazing find we tried to taste everything and nothing disappointed. Fabulous samosas, tikki masala and the goat was amazing. So glad to find this gem. We even tried a 1/2 pound of different dessert best part is that they also have to go if you are in a rush."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance and concept loved it friendly service.best food................................"}
{"text":"This place is great and super quick on service!! I've recently got hooked on their Indian chai and dahi batata puri and it is AMAZING. The two gentlemen that work there, Azim and Vinod, are just awesome and so kind. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Gr8 place .. Samosa awesme.. Same fr egg puff... Dahi batata puri one shd try definitely"}
{"text":"The staff were very kind.  Unfortunately, the food and presentation were underwhelming. I suggest offering more information about what is going to be served.  I also recommend serving the food on a tray, since the lack of plates creates a mess."}
{"text":"worst Indian food , I ordered samosa and Biryani , both were super spicy and the whole restaurant was crowded and smelly. The place is so small  you can barely walk between the chairs. Waste of money don't go there."}
{"text":"We had the papdi chaat; too much salt and not enough flavor. Felt like I was eating Morton's with a dash of garbanzo.  The dahi puri was full of sweet sauce and devoid of any other fillings.   From what others in our group said the pineapple pastry was too sweet and coconut pastry was too dense.  Its a self service place. I'm giving 2 starsI guess for being open till 10."}
{"text":"The name is a little misleading, because they serve more food then pastries which is a good thing because the food is excellent. If you like traditional Indian food that is spicy and very flavorful, you will love this place. I have tried several menu items and all of them, have been very flavorful and filled with yummy spices, BUT, come with a full glass of water or some milk, because sometimes the dishes are very spicy, however I am very much a light weight when it comes to spicy foods."}
{"text":"Best Indian food is Phoenix!!!! Biriyanis is delicious! Try the vijaywada!!! 2 kind of chicken meats!!! Love this place"}
{"text":"Stopped by last week for dinner. Jam packed with Indians again. We got a few subtle stares, not sure if it was because we were the only whiteys or because my shirt was still noticeably damp from my workout at the gym. We tried a variety of stuff this time - the biryani was new on the menu when we last visited and I'd been hanging to try it so I got the \"sultani chicken\" version and a couple of samosas. The wife got the vada pav and a combo plate, and the kid got a chicken puff. I'm going to keep it brief - this place lays on the hot chili like a bastard!! The chicken puff and samosas weren't too bad, but the vada pav (basically a fat potato patty in a burger) had a layer of ultra hot chili, and my biryani was almost uneatable. A few spoons in (it was temperature-hot as well!) and sweat started literally pouring off my face, dripping off my nose etc, I kid you not. It was almost comical how hot it was, like they had purposefully emptied a jar of ghost pepper juice into it to have a laugh at our expense. I thought I was used to hot curries since my culture makes them as well, but I think that my recent decade spent living in the US (or old age, or perhaps a combination of both) has softened up my tastebuds? Maybe I've just forgotten what a legit curry tastes like. I really liked it, but I literally got three full meals out of the biryani (I finished the last of it today, matter of fact). I thoroughly recommend this dish - it's extremely inexpensive, they serve up a generous amount and your arse will look like the Japanese flag for days after eating it.   I'm very impressed with this place - we'll be back! A promotion to four stars could be in its future - they don't hold back on their spices which means that anyone wanting to have Indian food that ain't dumbed down (like Bombay Spice used to do) could do a lot worse than dine here. Just bring a personal fan or a camelbak filled with ice water and have 911 on speed dial just in case."}
{"text":"Except the Vijayawada special biryani nothing else seemed special to me. I have tried all their pastries, samosas and puffs and they all seem pretty ordinary.  The person at the counter was unprofessional too,  and poor service.  The Pineapple pastry tasted good sometime back but the Black Forest was the worst I ever had.. It seemed like eating wet slices of bread with jam in the middle !  Not at all recommended"}
{"text":"This was one of my first experiences with Indian food and I've grown to love their pav bhaji. Since trying this dish at other places, I believe they make it the best. The restaurant very clean, nicely decorated and has an inviting atmosphere. Despite not being able to pronounce most of the names on the menu, the staff is extremely welcoming to me and provide guidance on trying new foods that I'm unfamiliar with. They always treat me like I'm a dinner guest in their home."}
{"text":"I hate this place. I love Tempe branch over this. As I have no other choice I had to choose this today. The biryani is just like jeera rice with chicken. Better close this off. I want to complain the same all the time I go here. Please improve guys !!"}
{"text":"There is a chef here named Preetam he is decent, accommodating & polite.... above all a great cook... I'll keep going back as long as he works there.  P.S. pastries are mehhhh"}
{"text":"This was my third visit to this place. I liked the place first two times, but the food was quite bad this time around. Ordered 2 Pav Bhaji's, 1 samosa chat and 1 pani-puri for me and a friend. Samosa chat had only one samosa in it, the chat curry was cold and didn't taste fresh at all. I had to return pani puri because the water tasted very bad. The manager changed it for dahipuri instead, which tasted good. Pav bhaji was an okay meal, the Pav was cold though. Taste was just about alright. I think this restaurant has good potential, but they need to improve their standard."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing . Service with a smile. The manager is very helpful helping you make the right selection. I had the Chicken Biriyani. The best in Phoenix. This is my new lunch spot."}
{"text":"Hi today we went to pastries n chaat with my friends.. We ordered pizza, biryani, veg nd non veg specials and the appetizers...everything is awesome and their customer service is really good. The sweets and chat items are tastes really good. I suggest to everyone to go to this place. The quality of food is good for the amount which we pay..one day I will surely come back for their chat items...."}
{"text":"I couldn't tell you anything about how authentic the Indian food here is as an American, but as an alternative to the standard American fare in the area, and as a vegetarian, I found the food here to be delicious. I was also delighted at the breadth of yogurt dishes and pastries. I'll have a lot of new things to try for the next few months. The servers were also very friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Stopped at this place twice this week seeking samosas.  They didn't have them both times, even though they were promised he following day.  They were very nice, but I need samosas!"}
{"text":"Subba Reddy was so helpful with our first time eating indian food. Will be back for the beautiful pastries. Super clean restaurant as well.  Loved the chat!"}
{"text":"Permanently crowded during peak hours with Indians. Chaat can be good or bad based on the day. Guess it depends on the mood of the chef on each day.Taste doesnt seem to be constant. Pani Poori is a waste of money- Pooris are so small in size. doesnt do justice. Dahi has an authentic taste which adds a good flavour to the chat.  Overall an average place and can eat to satisfy taste buds once in a while."}
{"text":"Great spot for a quick bite of indian foods. Vegetarian friendly.  Samosas are crispy n lightly spiced. Chicken tikka pizza made on naan bread is different but good. I had the lunch special , paneer vindaloo. Tasted great  The deserts are good. At least the indian desserts. I haven't tried the American desserts yet but I will"}
{"text":"This was my first time at the Tempe location, I've visited the Chandler one several times. Comparing the two locations, this is certainly a lot smaller. However, the food quality and service was equally good. We tried the pav bhaji, samosa chaat and the masala chai. While the pav bhaji could've used a little more flavor, the samosa chaat was really good. Nice place for a little afternoon snack and tea!"}
{"text":"Their food is fantastic! Possibly the most authentic Indian food I've ever had outside of India. I highly recommend the Vada Pav, and samosa chaat. Their chocolate mousse pastry is delicious as well, very light and airy without being too sweet. I liked their paneer tikka pizza as well and their chicken 65. Highly recommend this restaurant for reasonably priced, authentic Indian food. They never fail to disappoint!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I stopped by at Pastries n Chaat today. As a native Mumbaikar I had some pretty high expectations and was on the hunt for authentic Indian chaat (the pastries were a plus). We came here around 5pm and the place was fairly empty. There was a nice display of pastries and Indian sweets (chum chum, jalebi, imarti etc). We ordered the samosa chaat, vada pav and a chocolate mousse pastry. I had some pretty high expectations for the vada pav and I was not disappointed. The bread itself was nice and chewy, the vada was hot, crisp and delicious. The chutneys were very flavorful and worked well with the vada. I definitely recommend trying it. The samosa chaat was tasty as well, although I would have liked a bit more dahi(yogurt)  but it was still tasty. The serving size for the samosa chaat was big enough for two people to share. The chocolate mousse pastry was absolutely fantastic! Light , airy and chocolatey without being sickeningly sweet. I definitely recommend this pastry. I ended up buying two more pastries to take home (butterscotch and Black Forest) which are sitting in the fridge while I fight the urge to eat them  Overall I loved this place, really brought back memories of being in India, I look forward to trying their Biryani next time I'm here. I would recommend this place to all my friends!"}
{"text":"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS LOCATION. They are the best! They treat customers like family and are always willing to do anything to make the customer feel comfortable. I go here 3 or 4 times a week and they never dissapoint. The food is ALWAYS DELICIOUS and fresh. Their coffee is the best I am so addicted. The food is authentic and flavors are great!! Not to mention the yummy deserts. Prices are very reasonable. MoHinish is extremely helpful with helping you pick something on the menu and very knowledgeable. You can tell he likes what he does and goes above and beyond to make the customer feel like royalty. Blown away by this business. If you haven't tried them you need to do so now! You won't regret it!!!"}
{"text":"I usually put review if the I really like it it I hate it. From the rating you would have realized I have not like it. I ordered 3 things chai(dine in), pav bhaji and boneless biryani both to go.Lets classify the review based of:  SERVICE: is the one that compelled to write the review. The order I received was pav bhaji dine in with no tea and biryani to go without curry and raita. It took 10 mina to catch one of those guys to get him to make the pav bhaji to go and other 5 mins to get the raita and the curry or chatni. The tea was low on sugar, I looked around and neither did I  find any sugar nor the servers didn't feel the need tell me where I can find one. I came home and added sugar. So overall very poorly managed, inexperienced and low on staff.  Food : pav bhaji was good.biryani was ok but I expected chicken to be more tender. Food taste was the reason they got 2stars otherwise it was 1  Ambience: Filled with Indian students from ASU. Feels like you are back in India."}
{"text":"We ordered mirchi bajji,samosa paneer puff and some veggie special combo.None of the items were good.They tasted like heated frozen stuff..I'm not going back there again."}
{"text":"I have gone back to Pastries and chaat and this time I had the boneless chicken biryani, samosa, mango lassi, chicken suka and House special, chicken. The meal was excellent and it was so big, we had leftovers. The food was exceptionally delicious although extremely spicy. The house special and the samosa have the right amount of heat for someone like me. The biryani is so spicy no matter how much they try to make it \"mild\" based on my request. Mango lassi was just perfect. This place is nothing short of a great restaurant. I just wish they had more options and the spice level was slightly lower. They are very popular with Indians which proves they're doing it right! One star missing because I was craving their chai so bad and they were \"out\". But definitely returning soon!    I think I have finally found an Indian restaurant I am willing to return to!   Yesterday the plan was to go eat somewhere close to this place but when I saw it, I remembered that I've been wanting to try it because I have been on the lookout for a good Indian restaurant and I just could not find one I really like.   We were there at around 4:30pm, you place your order at the cashier and take a number and wait for your food. We ordered two chicken Dhum biryanis, one order of samosas, a combo platter which is basically a curry served with one roti and rice but you have the option of replacing the rice with another roti so we did and we chose paratha & a drink.  The food was served very quickly we hardly waited for 3 minutes! That was a great start because we were very hungry. The food tasted great! My only comment on the food was that the biryani was way too spicy for me & even my husband who has a pretty high tolerance for spicy food thought it was a little too spicy for him. The curry was amazing! I enjoyed every bite!  To try and tone the fire in my mouth down, I decided to order chai. I paid in cash but I accidentally paid a few pennies more. I don't care for pennies but even though I mentioned to the cashier that I gave him more money, he didn't return the change. I just let it slide. I also mentioned to him that the food is great but the biryani is way too spicy so he mentioned that they assume it's medium spicy when you order unless you request a mild version. Ok! Good tip for next time. Chai was absolutely delicious! Finally, a place that serves my kind of chai.   A few minutes later and since I was still hungry because I could hardly eat a few bites of my biryani, I ordered Dahi Batata Puri, a snack I've always enjoyed in Dubai. I paid in cash again, it was a $10 bill and the change would have been $1.34. I didn't get the change immediately so when the snack was served, the server put a dollar bill on our table with the receipt. No 34 cents!! They are cents so I don't really care the amount is too small but it is not acceptable to do that! If I want to tip I will of course but you cannot \"keep the change\" until we say so.   Overall, food was great so I am willing to return to the restaurant but if the \"change\" thing will happen again, I will have to mention this!  4* stars for food & I would have given 4* on service but not this time."}
{"text":"Stopped by since I was in the area. You need to order at front and pay first. Then find a table and wait. Water is free but need to pick it at the back corner.  People at counter were attentive and also made interesting joke. Ordered goat biriyani, papri chaat, chicken tikka masala combo and chicken tikka pizza. They had thums up which Indian coke.  Good arrived in paper plates. I guess it keeps cost down from hiring cleaning crew for dishes. Biriyani was good but was missing kick you expect from spices. Pizza had lot of cheddar cheese and green peppers. Instead of chicken tikka masala they brought paneer masala. It was bit sweet. Again missed the spice kick. I think best was chaat.  Lot of Indian Bollywood music in background... Kids friendly place..."}
{"text":"You won't find a buffet here. Smaller selection of items on the menu but VERY tasty. Setup similar to Woodlands (plastic forks, fast Indian food), but this place is clean and delicious. Great desert/pastry offerings. Kind of a fusion restaurant - they have chicken tikka pizza.....can't wait to try that one!"}
{"text":"Casual Indian food, it seems a bit hard to find but Pastries N Chaat has it,  Just an FYI Chaat are Indian snack / street foods of which this place has many of in addition to curry combo plates, and even fusion style pizzas.  I tried two curry combo plates $5 and $7 that come with rice, parantha (a bread) raita (yogurt) and a token salad.   The curry had explosive flavor and a strong spice note. The paratha was soft and moist. Luckily I had the raita to cool down my mouth.  Anther selling point is the interior, modern and clean, anyone should feel comofrtable visiting."}
{"text":"I would give this place a 0. I put in a to-go order for a couple of popular dishes and took a seat at one of the tables with the token for table number. After 45 mins of waiting, I go up to the counter and enquire about the status. My order had been sitting at the front desk all this while. There were hardly 6 customers."}
{"text":"Pastries N Chaat is the \"go to\" place for Indian students and anybody else at ASU. Better known as PnC, they offer a very wide variety of Briyani and other Indian street food (Chaat). Their Paneer Briyani is slightly expensive but is worth the money! This and their Chicken Briyani are Best sellers. The mango lassi is also very good here. The quantity is more than sufficient for one person and the customer gets to choose his spice level on almost any of the Briyani PnC offers. While the chaat items are not amazing, they do bring back memories of India. The stuffed rolls are amazing. It's a must go for everybody in and around Tempe."}
{"text":"Real good Indian food in North Scottsdale. Wish they can increase the number of items on their menu."}
{"text":"My family and I went on Mother's Day, the place was really quiet so we should have taken that as a sign and left. We ordered a papdi chaat, chicken sukha, and roti. The roti was crispy and dry and the papdi chaat made mine and my husbands stomach hurt so we could only assume it was an old item that they gave us. The chicken wasn't very good either. It's a shame we use to like pastries n chaat, but won't come back after today's experience"}
{"text":"Pastries n chaat biryani is one of the best biryani in town.The chaat is yummy and also the staff is very kind and friendly. The front guy is always helpful and recommends the best in their menu. I strongly recommend this place for anyone missing awesome food...."}
{"text":"Pastries & Chaat is a hidden gem tucked away in the savers shopping center. I came for lunch and was surprised that there was only one other table occupied. I was solo so a nice quiet lunch was exactly what i was hoping for. The staff was very friendly. The chef made an effort to come out and ask how everything was and even offered me a sample of another meal, since it was my first time in. I had the samosa chaat which was delightful. It was like a samosa, chickpea, nacho-like experience. The sample the chef brought me was the pav bhaji, which was also delicious. Check this place out, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Indian Restaurants are MUSHROOMING in this part of the valley. Pastries N Chaat offers their variation of Hyderabad Dum Biryani and Baked goods to us. This Indian Restaurant is a little different. It doesn't have the aroma of an Indian Restaurant when you walk in. This restaurant is casual order at the counter service but for sure doesn't look like a hole in the wall kind of place as it looks modern with high end touches of beautiful wood, attractive fire feature and gleaming high end tiles. Food wise they offer more appetizers than I normally come across at Indian restaurants, Unique Indian Pizzas and Fabulous looking Layer Cakes and other baked items.  We started with Cut Michi (battered jalapeños) Nothing wrong with them as they were tasty. Mild like bell pepper but as you know jalapeños are inconsistent with heat.   We shared the appetizer of Apollo Fish. The mild and meaty fish was marinated with exotic flavors and spiced up pretty nicely. Some pieces were cooked perfect and some with dry and chewy. Still not bad but ok.....  We shared the Vijayawada Biriyani. (combination of boneless chicken and boned leg and thigh with rice dish) All the chicken meat was tender but dryish. Flavors were much milder than from other Indian restaurants...  not a bad thing as some people prefer their food less seasoned. Sides of yogurt sauce and biryani gravy were less seasoned too. Dish was ok just not as tasty or served with as good chicken as I tried at other places. Portion was very VERY large. Maybe not enough meat for three people but was enough rice for three or four people.  The dessert I tried was something that shouldn't be missed. We shared the Butterscotch Layer Cake. It was layers of spongy cake with this delicious creamy Butterscotch Frosting. It was just right. Seemed light and wasn't too sweet!  The food I tried was ok and the cake was VERY GOOD in a comfortable casual restaurant with nice decor."}
{"text":"[updating review after a few more visits] Our first visit here was very exciting.  But after a few more visits at different times of the day, I'm increasingly dismayed :(  The indian fusion pizza is kind of neat, but the rest of the food is just \"meh\".  And even then, the pizza is inconsistent.  I really want them to get their act together and have better food.  That'd be awesome.  Please focus on food quality!  Especially for the prices you charge.    [previous review] Holy cow this place is a welcome change!  We have been looking for a great Indian restaurant in the area for ever and frankly all the normal Indian places are just played out and tired.  There is SOO much more to Indian food than chicken tikka masala and naan.  This place bring a the taste of MODERN Indian cuisine to the valley.  THANK YOU!!!   They have Indian street food (chaat) Indian deserts (including egg free cakes) and even fusion foods (try the chili paneer pizza)!  Well consider me sold. I'll be back.  And these guys deserve some rock hands.  Thank you for FINALLY up leveling the Indian food game in the valley  \m/ \m/"}
{"text":"Wonderful food, great portions, moderate prices, and exceptional service! Raphael has helped us each time we've gone back, and he is thoughtful and attentive. We want to try everything on the menu! I love the Paneer special and the Chicken Tikka (both around $7), and my husband loves the Sultani Biryani. Also, do yourself a big favor and get some Samosas on the side; they are the best."}
{"text":"A great place for authentic Indian food.   The prices are very reasonable and the food tastes great.    We really enjoy the Indian Pizza and biriyani selections.  If you don't like it spicy let them know as their standard is a little on the hot side."}
{"text":"I went here for the pastries and boy was I disappointed.  The cakes tasted like they were out of a box and the mousse was gritty. I had high hopes but was not good. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"The Kati Rolls rocks. The customer service and cleanliness of the restaurant was good"}
{"text":"THe first time we visited this place. The food was really good. We ordered the chicken puff, egg puff and few pastries. THe pastriess were really amazing and by far the best I have tasted in the US. Now the not so good things: 1.) service is horrible. 2.) They dont even serve you water and you have to ask for it. In spite of asking the server forgot my water(not once but twice) 3.)Service is extremely slow. 4.) The second time I went, the chicken puff was stale. When I informed the manager about it he was really not bothered. I will go again here only for the pastries."}
{"text":"It was on the greasy side and rather salty for my taste. The overall flavor was good but disappointed with the amount of grease on my samosas and flat bread."}
{"text":"The BEST INDIAN FOOD . Prices also very reasonable . Place is too good . People are so friendly . Every dish in menu are AWESOME . Recently they added dosa ,all variety of dosas are good ."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant yesterday. Really nice food. Though it was Saturday night and restaurant was busy the service was real good and quick! Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"The effort this restraunt is putting into to bring you authentic Indian food along with modern Indian food for Arizonans is commendable. Nice atmosphere and vibrant food. Do not forget to try some delicacies from Pastry section .Need big improvement on desert section"}
{"text":"Good food and reasonable pricing. I got the Chicken Biryani to go and love the food. Online ordered it and picked it up at the store. They have good number of pastries and Indian sweets on display too. Next time I will try that."}
{"text":"Yet another place if you are craving for some Indian snacks. Crazy lil menu, quick service. Ordered -  Dahi Batata Puri : tasted delicious. Totally worth the price.  Pav Bhaji : tasted good, not a great one though. I felt Bhaji lacked lil Indian kick . Was served hot, should appreciate this.  This is a tiny restaurant in a very happening asu arena. Good ambience, Would definitely revisit for some entrees and Indian pizza."}
{"text":"3 words...CHICKEN TIKKA PIZZA.   After years of avoiding cuisine fusions, I am happy to announce between tears of joy and mouthfuls of an Italian-Indian matrimony, that the chicken tikka pizza is a fantastic dish. It is fantastic enough for me to drive back to Arizona just to eat it once again.   I also tried the chicken tikka appetizer and the chaat and was happy to taste the authentic flavors. I do wish the portions were a little larger for the price ($7-10) but will not complain because great tasting Indian joints are always difficult to find.   The best part of the experience was the friendly workers there. The cashier, sweeter than their gulab jamun, really took the time to talk to us and get feedback while we were there. Can't wait to go back or find a location in California!"}
{"text":"Excellent Chaat! Fantastic place! My mother and I got the Veg Thali and Samosa Chaat. Best Samosa Chaat I've ever had. The decor is modern and the restaurant is sparkling clean. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food, I tried many things and that all had decent flavor with the right consistency.... Only thing that sucks is the service and wait times between how your meals come out... They hardly ever come out together and you'll wait forever... Go if you have time... The foods worth a try."}
{"text":"They serve chicken to a vegetarian person and no apologies for the act, even after the person suffers from serious medical conditions."}
{"text":"Whoa!!! Totally got the real deal here. I also feel pretty special because I ordered something that's not on the menu. I ordered a chicken 65 and it is an explosion of flavor. Normally it is considered a pepper chicken.  I was advised to order it this way. It is rumored to have 65 spices! Wow! No wonder its totally intense. I really enjoyed the authenticity of the flavor."}
{"text":"Just now got a Black Forest, and Chocolate Mousse cake. Both are clearly gone bad, stale, and tasted horrible.   I wonder how they can sell such stuff. We got Pineapple Pastry before and it was not this bad."}
{"text":"Great food nd service. Really  liked the people here. Accommodating and friendly.  One of the best indian places on this area"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food here. It's more of Indian street food and I thought that was unique. So far I have been able to try: paneer special, nonveg special, bhel puri, samosas, pain puris and masala chai. And of course I didn't eat all of this all alone! (Although...I probably could have. You see, I'm traveling from afar and from a small town with no Indian restaurants. So I had to get my fix. With friends!) The pani puris were not the best and a little expensive for my taste ($3.99/6). Not enough potatoes and onions. Fill it up like a true Indian! ;) The masala chai was aight. I like mine spiced with lots of ginger. I may be comparing it to my mom's. Overall I would make this place a regular but first try out some other places. I thought the prices were mostly decent. Customer service was good."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here on a whim before we went to see a movie at Studio Movie Grill (which has gross food and horrible seating btw) and I'm so happy we came here! Right when you walk into the restaurant you are hit with the most pleasant aroma of Indian spices. The inside is very well designed and the staff is very nice and helpful. We got two appetizers (samosas and the paneer 65) and one entree (chicken biryani) to share. The food was super flavorful and perfectly spicy! We both loved our food and thought that this place was probably the best Indian food we have ever had in AZ! I would HIGHLY recommend this place to eat for lunch or dinner. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"When to lunch and ordered non vegetarian Thali . Unfortunately The food was cold  And I felt the archari  chicken was at least a day old,. Daal was bland and cold as well   Ordered take out biryani  chicken tikka and daal with naan. Chicken tikka was extremely hard and one could not eat or chew the chicken , we hed to throw it away . Biryani was average the Salan was just water with turmeric . Very disappointed with my take out .  The competition is very severe especially in the bell road area ie notably biryani bites and paradise biryani offering very good and very consistent Andhra home type food and I doubt I will go to paradise chat again."}
{"text":"The food was very delicious, I have not eaten at many Indian restaurants. I was very impressed and manager was very kind and made sure at all time we were doing well.  Thank you for a good experience and great food!"}
{"text":"This our usual quick indian fix place. They do have eggless Black forest cake and love chicken 65 here."}
{"text":"Great food at a great price, love when we come across hidden gems. Ordered the delicious samosa Chaat ( yum) and the pani puris both were great! Then we added on an order of samosa and a mango lassi, total was less than $17.00"}
{"text":"Best Biryani and cakes in town !! PNC Vijayawada biryani  their most selling biryani!! Delicious Indian  Cakes will be ready under 2 hours !!"}
{"text":"Good Indian food. To get all menu details. please call at store, sometimes Website is not up-to date"}
{"text":"Lots of hype but disappointing.  This place bills itself as the purveyor of World Class Biryani. Those of us from the sub continent may beg to disagree. My biryani was a wolf in sheep's clothing! Much like French Champagne, the word biryani is related to a culinary delight that most foodies with a sub continent experience will immediately recognize in the first bite. The biryani I got was a very shallow imposter of the real McCoy. I admit that customers with limited knowledge of what biryani actually is, might question my point of view. That's fine and good. But if eating real biryani is your goal, the stuff you get here will not do the job. It would be akin to calling Prosecco champagne.  Mon Dieu!!! This is a tragedy.  All the same the folks here are good people and try their best. But trying your best is not enough if you intend to pass rice mixed with something resembling spinach as biryani."}
{"text":"Good food. Not a very neat place to eat but the service is fast. The boneless chicken biryani is my favorite. The restaurant management should seriously consider sprucing the place up a bit. The prices are reasonable too. There is room for improvement."}
{"text":"Ordered for two pizzas and when I got it I could smell that something was burnt.. I brought it to the notice of restaurant but they told that it is how they prepare it..   Worst pizza that I had till date!! Hope nothing beats it ;)"}
{"text":"This place is as good as it gets 4 Quick Indian food has a simple menu not overwhelming really authentic lots of families coming through and also has an excellent selection of pastries of course cakes and traditional Indian pastries it is also very authentic if you've been to India or if you like real Indian food this is a good place"}
{"text":"Really yummy food. Really didn't care for the service. The kid at the counter didn't know the menu well. He told us the kheema curry came with rice but it didn't. We also checked into yelp to get the 10% off and he swiped our credit card before he applied the discount so we never got the discount...silly kid. He also forgot to give us our chai. Maybe I'll try this place again in a few months when the staff are better trained."}
{"text":"Since I enjoy goat and lamb I tried the Goat Dum Biriyani.  The flavor was excellent, nice and spicy and very hot. Large portion size. Since I have never tried this dish here or elsewhere, I wasn't sure exactly what to expect. With that said, there were bones. A lot of bones....in fact much more bones than meat and this isn't a rib dish. So what meat there was was good. But eat carefully. Lots of bone fragments throughout. Maybe this is the way it is supposed to be but lucky for me it was so hot so I didn't bite down hard."}
{"text":"Loved the yummy food here. I would recommend it to all north phoenixians. If you are looking for a fast tasty place to eat indian food, you can definitely try this out"}
{"text":"Was great Indian food for a reasonable price. I have been to a lot of bad Indian restaurants! So it was a delight to find one that was exceptional good."}
{"text":"One of the best Bakeries in all of North Scottsdale! Try their Opera Pastry. It tastes like coffee!"}
{"text":"This place is one of my fav spots in the Valley for Indian snacks, pastries and cakes. Probably one of the very few places that does eggless cakes. Unlike most indian snack shops, this one is definitely upbeat and clean. My last visit, service was a bit slow probably because they were a new business. But visit after visits, I have become a fan of this place. Not only that but even my friends that I recommended to Pastries and Chaat to loved the food. This place has potential and its always packed. I got a custom cake made from this place and it was delicious. The chef was very nice and took his time to understand what I wanted and presented me with an even better version of my cake. Hats off!!! Their chicken pizza is the best you can get in town. Also the mango cake actually tasted like mangoes. Keep up the good work guys."}
{"text":"Wow... great food and size portions are great.. so glad we stopped by to try it!  Tikka masala-samosas-shrimp pepper n ginger-pastries-"}
{"text":"The Pav bhaji was good comparatively.  Wasn't the best day to have samosas. Have had better here. Tea and pani puri is mediocre. Stay away from misal pav. The staff was very courteous and friendly."}
{"text":"Got a text from 578-277 with a buy 1 get 1 Biryani offer which expires on 05/30. When I tried to claim it on 05/20 they completely denied that the offer exists and pushed the blame on the rewards management company. What's the point of asking people to sign up for rewards and not honoring them? 1 star because you cannot honor your own offer!"}
{"text":"Average food joint with average food. Ordered twice from here and I didn't find anything special to go gaga about. The pastries are good... Combo meal chicken curry is something from out of space and wasn't that good. Rice and roti in combo were ok and kind of revived my taste buds a bit. Chicken puff is good, but a bit expensive @ 2.99 a piece! Chaat - vada pav (good) but no sauce or anything was provided, pav bhaji - the curry was not that tasty .. A bit bland. Pizza - chilling chicken pizza - I was kind of expecting Indian style chilli chicken, but it was different with a ton of American greasy cheese and a hint of green chilli sauce as a base with capsicum and cucumbers I think. It had good amount of chicken pieces though! Needs to improve taste in the food items and less greasy cheese please."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's quick and simple and the food is fantastic. I usually just grab a veg or non-veg Thali and I'm good. It's always a little different and always fills me up.   Oh the music is always entertaining too. :)"}
{"text":"i've had lunch here twice now and I'm very impressed with the quality of the food.  The biryani and tikka masala remind me of the great food I ate when I spent several months in Hyderabad.  Spicy in all the good ways, without being overwhelming.  The staff is very friendly and helpful in explaining the different items on the menu.  The place is clean with plenty of seating at lunchtime."}
{"text":"**Vegetarian Friendly**  This place has such great \"street food\" that you would find in India. Literally of my favorites. All of the portions are large, and worth the price.   They have a menu on display, but it doesn't include all of their items. Their printed menu does (I posted the printed menu).  This place does have halal (kosher) meat.They had a bakery section of individual cake slices, and it reminded me of bakery Mongini's in India. They have eggless cake options too.   Cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends and it was a fantastic experience. The food was super affordable and definitely tasted authentic--which is a common criticism for \"fusion\" places such as these. Everything we ordered was pretty decent: chili paneer pizza, chaat, mango lassi, all of it tasted up to par. We even ordered some pastries and surprisingly that was the worst part: it was still good, not great. Chaat & Chaat doesn't have as good of a ring to it though so I understand the name."}
{"text":"This place has consistently had the best biryani every visit! The biryani is very flavorful and filling. The best biryani we have tried here is the Dum biryani, which is loaded with chunks of bone in chicken. The samosa chaat is huge is also very good. We tried pani puri during this visit, it was average. I was skeptical at first about Indian pizza, but it's actually really good, I haven't had it at the chandler location but the Scottsdale location makes a great paneer pizza. The atmosphere is casual and great to pop in for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Best Samosa's I've ever had... Including my travels in India!  They came out piping hot and crispy with both traditional sauces.  I cannot wait to try the many Biriyani's, Chaat, and the Paneer Tikka Pizza!!! Oh my goodness I can't believe I've never been here. A hidden gem behind Jack-in-the-Box?!???? Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Oh my. Looks like I found my forever restaurant location. True, quite hole in the wallish looking and forget coming for lunch at 12, cos everyone and their mama here. But hey, I didn't come here to stare at the chairs or the wall or at some of them Indian ladies' gorgeous hair, I came here to stuff my belly with some Indian street food deliciousness so let's get to that! Food is a bit on the spicy side, just how I like it. One dip in the buccal cavity and voila, a burst of flavorful sensations. The right combination of sweet, sour and spicy. Yum!!! I'm not a fan of the desserts though. Too sweet, but that's typical of Indian desserts if you dig that."}
{"text":"I'm really surprised at all the positive reviews.  I think the service is one of the worst I have experienced.  There is nothing positive I can say about the staff as they are unfriendly and annoyed when you have questions.  They are overpriced and the food is okay.  Mostly the service sucks."}
{"text":"This place is new and good. Pizza and Puffs are delicious. They don't serve Pani Puri which is one drawback compared to Little India.   Overall its a nice Chaat Place and the cakes are very good too.."}
{"text":"Great place for some authentic Indian food.. Portions and pricing are reasonable. Dine in and take out options.Food can be a little spicy if you not use to Indian food. Restaurant is clean,good parking,delivery is available. They also have an app."}
{"text":"This location has really gone down in customer service in recent times. The food isn't too great either. What bothers us most is that the staff knows nothing about their menu or what they have. Most of the time, items on the menu are not available and if they have them the staff does not know about it, I've had times when the cook from inside has had to let them know.   On this turn around, we went there specifically to have biryani which was mentioned to be on sale. We were told that the sale didn't pertain to this location and they only had one of the biryani varieties out of 3 on the menu!!!! What the hell!!! Moreover there were tables that hadn't been cleaned up and there was no chai! This location always had free Chai for people waiting but they don't anymore.  Last time we ordered by phone we found that our order had changed when we went to pick it up. We like some hot sauce/chutney on our samosas and usually they would give us two of the hot instead of the hot and sweet sauce they usually provide. This time when we asked for it the guy made a face and behaved like he was doing us a huge favor.  Also what's with them not honoring their deals!!!!! This is the second time we've seen specials for this location online but when we go there they make an excuse or say it's not for this location! What the hell!!!   Overall we've been bitten too many times now to EVER return to this location. Stay away!!! I would put zero stars If I could but yelp doesn't allow me to."}
{"text":"A mouth watering,belly filling experience with amazing paneer/peas curry, pepper shrimp,chicken 65,and goat biriyani.everything was unbelievable perfectly spiced. I hear that they have gotten new chefs and the quality has improved tremendously from a few months ago.if haven't been to PNC recently gi back and I am sure you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We just popped in for an order of Samosas to go. We were very pleased. Going back to try other dishes. Nice guy behind the counter. The desserts look yummy! Will have to try them too!"}
{"text":"Great chaats, and very close to my place! I believe they are among the best Indian restaurants in the area. Quick service and delicious food!"}
{"text":"Bought milk pedas and Black Forest cakes from here. Had to pay  $ 20+ for 4 pieces of cakes and half pound of pedas but the quality of the food was very poor. Pedas should be named like cardamom pedas instead of milk pedas. And when microwaved pedas as instructed by the staff it became a disaster. Cakes were not fresh so that after 4 miles drive to home it started oozing out some liquid and was hard as if it was made days ago. Would never go to this place again."}
{"text":"We have been to Pastries and Chaat twice in 3 days since we found out it opened. My kids are begging to go back again!  We have been to the Bell Rd location. This one has similar offerings but the space is much larger. It's clean and the service is very friendly. We are not Indian but we lived in Little Bombay (aka Jackson Heights Queens) so we know a fair amount about the food. The server explained everything though for us especially regarding spice levels for the kids. My son loved the chicken sukka and both kids went nuts for the cakes. Sizes are small enough that you can each try a different one (not the massive portions you find in American chains). They have eggless cakes too (not sure if that's for vegans?). My husband loved the biryani (we tried the chicken and goat). Happy they opened here in Scottsdale so I don't have to travel so far!!"}
{"text":"If only I could have given a negative star for this business. I have visited almost all the pastries and chat in the valley and I was very satisfied with each one of them except this. I went to this yesterday with my family and my 2 year old daughter. After placing the order we sat down in a booth and I took 3 paper plates for us. My daughter wanted a cake and they gave the cake on a small paper plate so I transferred the cake to the bigger paper plate because at this age she wants to try on everything on her own and it's difficult to manage in small plate. The rest of the dishes me and my husband were sharing so we had the other plates. Now the person called SUBBA gave the food and started saying can I take back the plates. I was taken aback. I have never seen in any restaurant taking back paper plates from customers table. He said what will you do with so many plates. I mean it's 3 paper plates for 3 people and he is counting those. He gave only one water cup when asked for. So 3 people will share one water cup. I am never going back to this location and would strongly recommend everyone not to go. I don't know what other means they do and if their food is also the one's wasted on everyone's plate. Very very dissatisfied."}
{"text":"The customer service was awesome and the food was even better. The vegetarian curry was to die for.  It is also super clean!"}
{"text":"Clean and authentic.  If you go for lunch, arrive before 2:30pm.  The close and reopen for dinner.  Service is pleasant and quick.  Order your food at the counter and they bring the food to you.  I ordered the Samosa Chaat full of garbanzo beans, potatoes and sauce.  It is topped with a pakora.  It was pretty hot so beware if you're not into spices.  Next time I will ask.  The smells in the place are a wonderful blend.  I will try it again."}
{"text":"First off, i was super excited because its almost impossible to get indian street food in AZ - esp., Puff pastries with egg/chicken/veg fillings here in tempe/az. So i wanted to try that out. The egg puffs did not have any decent gravy, and were basically saltless , spiceless (by spice i dont mean just chilly/hot spices, i mean all combo of indian spices), and just boiled egg inside a pastry sheet baked. And the veg puffs had majorly paneer in them, and i couldn't taste any other veggies! I wonder what panner puffs would have had in them! I mean veg puffs have onions, tomatoes , peas and a host of other spices forming the curry inside it. And other foods are all the same, for instance samosa, samosa chaat is extremely overrated. It had just one small pretty bland samosa (which again wasn't that great), and the channa in the chaat wasn't that great either.  Add to all this they overprice it (which by the way is super cheap in indian streets) like its some niche rare authentic street food. But if my experience of growing up in india for 20 yrs is any good, it most definitely is not authentic. Bottomline, if you are an indian like me missing home street food, don't have huge expectations, and be ready to shell out way more money for what the food is worth. And probably just go only when you miss/ can't make these indian chaat food yourselves!"}
{"text":"The samosa chaat is delicious. Everything else we have eaten here is good too. The dum biryani and the chicken tikka are both really good. I was not impressed with the goat, and would not order that again. But seriously, get the samosa chaat or you're a nerd."}
{"text":"Y'all know me I love to eat and willing try out new food spots in the valley today's adventures bring me here. The restaurant is NICE it's a bakery too! Staff was friendly and answered all my questions. Very nice place highly recommend it for my peeps in North valley. Oh and the food ! Very good experience will list list as one of my favorite places to dine~Later"}
{"text":"Not bad but not the best Indian I have had.  The service was great and we were encouraged to try a couple of new items which did not disappoint.  The lassi was awesome....not sure if they make it but it was thicker than I have ever had.  There is nothing boring on the menu so if you have a picky eater (like a 4 year old) they may not find anything they like."}
{"text":"Came here eith my wife for lunch (we are still eating). Excellent service! Very polite and gave us a free sample of their green chicken curry! Delicious!!! Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"The setting for Friends is a coffee place, How I met your mother is a bar, Rules of Engagement is a  brunch place. Now, if I have to choose a setting for an indian version of any of the above, it would undoubtedly be Pastries N Chaat! The owners are very friendly and treat you with a big smile when you enter the place.    I go here with my colleagues almost every day after work and it is a perfect setting to unwind over snacks and chai after a long day. We usually rotate between between the choices, but our popular ones are usually mirchi bhajji and dahi bhatata puri. I love their coffee as well.   If you are looking for a place to chill with your friends over indian snacks, I would strongly suggest Pastries n Chaat!"}
{"text":"My regular Indian food eatery . Their biriyanis are great . I am big fan of their Indian snacks. Their cakes so good"}
{"text":"My daughter and I were in the area after an appointment. We checked out Yelp to see what was nearby and this popped up.    Sometimes it's a risk listening to the reviews of fellow Yelpers. Not this time!   Pastries and Chaat is a tiny little place tucked in a strip mall. Walking in, you are greeted by a clean, minimally decorated dining area. The pastry display is like a slice of heaven! A wide array of cakes and mousses are beautifully displayed.    My daughter ordered the chicken tikka pizza. It was unexpectedly delicious! I ordered the samosa chaat. It was very tasty. I'm normally not a big fan of chutney, but the spices were spot on and the yogurt sauce helped cut the tang of the green chutney down a bit. The chickpeas were plentiful.      We decided to try some dessert. Oh. My. Gosh! I wanted to just bury my face in the slice of cake I ordered.    The next time we're in the area we plan on stopping in and trying more of their chaat selections as well as their amazing sweets!"}
{"text":"Went today for a quick bite. I really wanted pani puri. I walked in and liked the fast casual setting (order at the counter, get a number). Place was clean, loved the desserts in the display case, and food served quickly. I thought for the price it was a good deal. I could've used a bit more spice in mine, but it was pretty good as-is. I lived in London and while it wasn't quite as good as similar places there, it was way better than I expected and I will go again and bring my boyfriend, too. I found myself texting friends who lived nearby about it!"}
{"text":"I stopped by Pastries N Chaat in the Happy Valley Towne Court east of I-17 on Happy Valley Rd three weeks ago and I fell in love with the wonderful food.  The Chicken Biriyani and Rice was delicious.  The price is very reasonable and the quantity of food is plentiful.  The restaurant has lunch hours and dinner hours with a short break in between where they are closed.  The staff and chef are polite and very helpful in answering questions about the different dishes.  I have returned since my first visit and plan on adding Pastries N Chaat to my Favorite Restaurant List.  I highly recommend the food and the restaurant to anyone wanting something that is different with plenty of flavor."}
{"text":"Usual Indian fast food fare. There are other better options around but this is definitely a nice place to have some Indian chaats and sweets. They have some amazing Gulaab Jamuns here.  Definitely recommend if you are craving for a quick chaat bite."}
{"text":"K. So seriously, this is AMAZING.  I've been back 3 times since my first time and we will continue to visit for years to come I'm sure!  I don't know how it's possible to pack so much flavor into one thing, but these people know how. So fast we've tried the tikka special-MIND BLOWING, the tikka pizza-not mind blowing, but close enough!!!!!! The rice is mind blowing all on its own, I just get stuck shaking my head for hours because the deliciousness is TOO MUCHH!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love their food here. Fresh, clean, and very tasty. This is my third time back and the tikki masala has been consistent, hot and delicious. Definitely come here for a tasty snack/meal.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"BEST INDIAN FOOD! Don't listen to the negative reviews! This place is AWESOME. The Chef, Cashier, and Waiter are the sweetest people. OMG!  The Chicken Tikka Masala is SO GOOD! I've been to authentic Indian restaurant's and use to live in Irvine, CA where a lot of Indian restaurant's claim to be the best but this place is THE BEST! It's nice, relaxing, clean, and the staff are so nice. I let the owner know it was our first time and he took his time to explain the different items. This is my new favorite place. I actually just came from there and it was so good that I had to come home and write a review! :) If you're on yelp looking for an Indian restaurant STOP LOOKING! believe me... I've done my research. This place is the BEST! I felt like I went to India and came back, no passport required. :)"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Desk eatrry in the valley. They have 5 locations. The meat is halal. They also have vegetarian options if you have friends from Hindustan they have various pastries as well as common desserts from the subcontinent. Highly recommended for those who enjoy indo-pakistani cuisine."}
{"text":"Good indo-pak comfort food. Meat is halal and they have Desi pizzas. I came on a rainy day so the poor uncles working were not ready for our large order. Overall the parties are every nice. The service is Desi style (very polite)."}
{"text":"I had lunch here recently. This restaurant is semi fast-food style with gourmet Indian food. The food was good actually, but I didn't try the pastry. I had rice biriyani with chicken, it was good. The chai was blend and had no flavor, so I won't recommend that.  This restaurant looks new because everything looks nice and clean with modern decor style.  The only negative about this restaurant is that they need to smile more and friendly to the customers otherwise people don't feel welcomed."}
{"text":"I want to first start off by saying that it is Arizona and it was 112 out today. We walked into the store at 7pm and it was at least 5 degrees hotter inside than it was outside, it was miserable to just stand inside for 5 minutes to order.   The young girl who was taking our order was extremely rude and when we inquired about some images we found in Yelp she was no help. Definitely not a good experience within the first couple of minutes.   We ordered two pastries which were bright to us before our food. So we ate that first. The pastries we got were the tiramisu and butterscotch cakes. They were room temperature which was 120 degrees. I've definitely had better, but it was ok.   For Entrees:  Bhel Puri: It was not very good. It was more like an Indian Frito pie. We had 2 bites and threw it away. It was very blan outside of the sauce it had on the top, which wasn't very much.   Chicken Curry Special: Was good. Rice, chicken curry soup, bread and some fresh veggies. Since we didn't eat the other two entrees, it wasn't quite enough for us to share but it had great flavor.   Sanoma Chaat: A pastry stuffed with potatoes with a green sauce, chick peas and a little spice similar to a thick stew. I'm assuming it was suppose to be a hot entree, and it came out cold, minus the actual pastry was hot. Not very good, probably better had it been cooked fresh and served as an entire hot plate.   I think if they had air conditioning I would have given a 2 star; considering the food was mediocre and it was HOT and not a comfortable environment to eat in, I give it a 1. I would not recommend this spot to anyone.   I would however recommend Marigold Maison which is close by, delicious food, a GREAT environment and fully working air conditioning."}
{"text":"The food is delicious but it takes forever. I went 3 times because I wanted to be sure the awful wait wasn't just a bad day. Every time it took a ridiculous amount of time before the food came up.  The next time I went the food for my friend and I came out The kitchen at different times. By the time she got her food mine was ice cold. So, the food is delicious  and the service is so slow that it is not worth it."}
{"text":"My son, husband and  I tried this franchise location in Phoenix and we were very happy with it. We would go back however I discovered the Scottsdale location has just opened and is closer to where we live so we will try the Scottsdale one next. What I like best of all was the dessert display case, there is supposedly a chef in the back personally making the single portion cakes, what an assortment. I could not decide between the mango cake, honey almond cake and the pistachio cake.  I definitely eat with all my senses and it starts with my eyes then to my head, mouth and I start reaching and grabbing for food!!! Mind you I am a longtime weightwatcher and fitness instructor so I count calories etc. , those cakes are worth saving my points!  Only reason I shorted them 1 star is due to the annoying fly on me for the 1st 5 minutes, then he moved on to another customer.I had boneless chicken biryani, son had paneer pizza and husband  had a very spicy chicken biryani - all good!Our cakes were moist and similar to tirimisu as far as the texture and soaking of the cake layers in a sauce - if that makes sense. We WILL go back!"}
{"text":"Avoid this place. Extremely rude and poor customer service. Basics were missing. They could not serve chai or coffee as they were out of milk. The person at the counter mistook the order. Overall a very bad experience."}
{"text":"Best place for spicy South Indian food. We love their biriyani and chat items. Not the best place for desserts."}
{"text":"food is good. tastes good. service is good. I feel it's bit pricey though for some items like pav bhaji which tastes good but quantity served is less. they can increase the quantity."}
{"text":"Okish food.  Egg roll which is of 5 dollars has only half egg in it. The dahi batata puri has only dahi and chutney in it. Thy put very less content of other things in it. Have tasted much better Indian  food in the valley."}
{"text":"I found a new stop for pastries. I sampled one myself and like them a lot. The staff was very kind, and I look forward to stopping in again soon.  It's great to find a new Indian restaurant in the area too."}
{"text":"The people were so friendly and offered options for my specific needs such as no meat! They also helped me eat the food the way it was intended to be! Atmosphere was nice and very clean! Very affordable as well!"}
{"text":"This is just a super average Indian food place. There are definitely much better Indian restaurants in the area. I had one of the pizzas and my friend had the paneer masala. For the price it was decent, but none of the food was that mind blowing. My pizza was definitely not a pizza, and was kind of falling apart everywhere. Indian pizza is a really interesting concept, and I'm sad that this place failed to execute that. I don't really see a reason to come back here but if I do, I'll definitely get the biryani as others have recommended"}
{"text":"Fast, DELICIOUS and courteous. This may very well be my new lunch spot. They have stuff I haven't seen in a menu since the Bay Area and it's even better than I remember. Masterful work of spices."}
{"text":"Ordered an array of chaat and a pizza to share. Had a chocolate croissant and samples of cake. Don't be afraid to just order. Only complaint is I need a translation to know what I am ordering but with everything tastes so good it really doesn't matter."}
{"text":"It's cheap, great taste a lot of food. I had chicken biryani for 12.99 it was really delicious  you should try the yogurt they give with the food it cools you down  Most importantly you can have one for two it's just economical and definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"Worst experience every time I have been to this place. It used to be a great place for Indian food but no more. Especially because of the service and not so much for the food.   The guy at front desk with a red cap on (always has the same red cap on) at the Chandler location makes sure you have the worst exp. PNC sends you a promo for \"Buy any chicken/Veg biryani for $7.99\" and when I reach to order a Boneless Chicken biryani, it suddenly becomes only Dum Chicken biryani promo. I asked it said Any Chicken or Veg Biryani, to it the guy in the red cap says \" Sir it actually says any Chicken or Veg Biryani and not ANY chicken or ANY veg Biryani.\"  So this guy decided what I will order!! Shame on PnC for keeping such staff and sending customers away.. Don't waste your money here. Other store offer much better food with a better price and much BETTER Service.   Good bye PnC!!"}
{"text":"I have been anticipating trying this place for awhile and I am so glad we did. It is a really cool concept. It is a bakery and Indian fast food place combined. But good fast food. They have a selection of Indian \"chaat\" (street food), a couple types of pizza and a couple daily specials which appear to be full meals. We split samosas and their vegetarian tikki masala pizza. My husband also had some sort of chicken hot-pocket sort of thing. The samosas were perfect. Spicy and delicious. The pizza was interesting. It was on flatbread with a masala sauce, covered with bell peppers, onions and paneer cheese. It was good. I wasn't crazy about the flatbread it was on. I think it would be better on Naan. The service was very friendly and helpful. And the prices were amazing."}
{"text":"Prices were good but I didn't feel that I got enough food. Probably won't return and it took forever to come out. Would've liked more chicken in my dish but the taste was overall good. Would rather go to Indian Oven in Mesa for a full buffet."}
{"text":"Good food and friendly service. Pretty good price of like $8 for a chicken dish, rice, and a piece of naan. I'm not sure what I ordered but it's what he recommended when I asked for butter chicken (which they sadly don't have). Super great tender chicken in sauce, not too spicy."}
{"text":"New branch in chandler and food is good . Service is not that great as they do not serve any water or silverware.. Prices are reasonable and food is fresh ... I will highly recommend this place to all Ahwatukee and chandler chaat lovers"}
{"text":"Still stomach burning..  Tried Biryani today and it was so hot. Even as a South Indian I cannot take that spicy..  As it was only spicy so I could not say whether it is tasty or not..I will not go there again for Biriyani.."}
{"text":"Very nice place.. if you are a pastries fan then i would definitely recommend this place. Lots of variety of pastries and chaat snacks. I have tried pav bhaji , samosa chaat and chicken tikka pizza, samosas(both big and Irani) and puffs. Everything was good only concern was samosa could have been better.The service is kind off slow and we have to request for water all the time."}
{"text":"Great service and food is amazing. Have a wide variety of appetizers. If you lien biriyani this is a great place for that. Would highly recommend"}
{"text":"I like this restaurant a lot. I love Indian food, but Indian restaurants in the US aren't always the best lunch options since they take a while and usually have heavier dishes. PNC has more of the \"street\" food menu consisting of finger food, snacks, and smaller dishes - definitely enough for a lunch. We tried a few items, and all had great flavors you'd expect out of your favorite Indian restaurant. The samosa chaat was my favorite thing we got. Will definitely be back for lunch sometime soon."}
{"text":"Food is simply awesome here... I come here regularly with my friends and we simply loooove the food. From chaat to biryanis, you couldn't ask for better Indian food. Staff is awesome as well unlike the one's in Chandler location.   They should improve the seating though... Not many tables inside considering its going to be super hot in summer here!"}
{"text":"Poor service. We waited for over 30 minutes and noticed that they gave food to people who came after us and even after I asked them to bring out our food, kept bringing food to others.   Will not go here again."}
{"text":"This is for the new one on Happy Valley.  Sent my son to simply order two most popular dishes and they were amazing.  One was a burrito type thing with grilled onions and red chicken and the other was an awesome rice dish with two diff chicken styles...omg so tasty!"}
{"text":"this place showed up at a perfect time in my life--i had been telling my friends here in tempe how delicious and cool chaat/south asian street food is, and that it's the best place to find \"fusion\" food, such as curry pizza. then this place showed up in my life and guess what! they have pizza chaat. nice.   their samosa is also good.   i enjoyed their puffs at one point and was looking forward to trying their vada pav, but as of this time those items are no longer served."}
{"text":"4 stars for the ice cream but the food itself is ok. would love a vegan ice cream option."}
{"text":"Lovely!!! Amazing dhai battata chaat and delicious dessert!"}
{"text":"Normally not a vegan eater - but decided to give the vegan dishes a shot! Pav Bhaji was the meal of choice and they prepared it quickly and it tasted great! Have a lot of Indian food experience (though normally dining with meat! ;) ) - I enjoyed the surroundings and the background music - authentic and good for a quick bite to eat!"}
{"text":"1st, the young man at counter explained / described food on menue, The sampler plate was excellent, totally satisfying. The yogurt drink delicious. Clean, attractive.  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"An amazing place for people who misses indian chats back at home. Loved their dahi batata puri and samosa chats. Also do not forget to try their paneer pizza. Over all a very satisfied meal I had after a very long time."}
{"text":"Except the vijayawada biriyani nothing is good here. I got the veg biriyani four times and it was always stale.I trashed it in garbage. Not sure if they prepare fresh biriyani often. And the prices are expensive for the stale biriyani they offer."}
{"text":"Yemmy Yemmy SouthINDIAN style Biryani...  The food is really fresh and kind of home food.Prices are reasonable with enough quantity .And they are really doing good job in serving and maintaining standards.Funny thing we need to give tip before they serve .."}
{"text":"i ordered from these guys and asked them on the phone if everything was gluten free and void of wheat. they assured me it was. when i received my order, it was suspiciously breaded. i called back and was reassured there was no wheat. 3 different people told me this and argued with me. they said they use maida flour and all purpose flour only (both which are made of wheat). after 10 minutes convincing them they were wrong, they argued that they were not experts.  i understand my food allergies are my problem, but if i take a precaution and inquire, i believe a restaurant should at the very least know what is in their food. the level of rudeness and ignorance was completely unacceptable."}
{"text":"This i believe is their fourth valley location on University Drive in Tempe.They have others in Chandler,Bell road and Scottsdale.I first discovered this place on Yelp (Bell Rd,Phoenix) while craving some chaat and puffs and haven't looked back since.  I quickly moved on to the Chandler location which has been my regular place and then yesterday i decided to try Tempe because a.it's closer to my house. b.Chandler location did not have chicken puffs (which i'm absolutely addicted to and eat at least twice a week).  I called them to place my order to-go ~Vijayawada Biriyani (Regular chicken dum biryiani with boneless pieces of fried chicken on top) served with Raita(yogurt) and mirchi ka salan(chilli and peanut based gravy) $12.99 ~Chicken Puffs (puff pastry with a savory filling of chicken) $2.99 ~Dahi Puri (fried puff shells with yogurt,onion,chana and a tangy sauce) $4.99  This place is definitely smaller than their other locations and the biriyani was similar to Chandler.The puffs however were not as fresh and they mixed the yogurt and sauces in my order of Dahi puri making it soggy and almost unedible.  Generally for a to-go order of chaats they give you the sauces/yogurt separately to be mixed just before eating.Also instead of giving me the small puffs(used for pani puri) they had given me Papdi. Anyhow i guess being a fairly new location they haven't got the hang of it yet.The girl who took my order was clueless about the Dahi puri and i had to spell it out for her.In the end,i didn't seem to mind because what they made was a mix between Dahi puri and Sev puri which are one and the same.    PNC has also started a new rewards program where you can redeem your points for appetizers,biriyani etc (Free Food).Don't forget to Register.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Some Like it Chaat! And those that do head to Pastries N Chaat. This little shop is a few doors down from the Tempe Improv and sells a lovely looking selection of cakes and Indian sweets in addition to chaat, Indian style pizzas and main entrees.  The interior of the restaurant is contemporary with wood paneled walls and a digital screen menu. We browsed through the selections before deciding on a chicken tikka and keema pizza with mango lassi. The lassis are in the dessert case and are premade in small little drink cups. They had a refreshing creamy tangy taste. I enjoyed the pizzas. The chicken tikka pizza was filled with chopped white meat chicken, a copious amount of cheese and a sprinkling of cilantro. The dough was light and crisp, a little thinner than naan. I tasted some of the keema pizza which was filled with spiced ground lamb. I loved the spices in the meat but the pizza was a little soggy due to all the oil accumulating on the bottom of the pizza.  I peeked at some other people's orders and the biriyani looked quite impressive so I will have to try that next time I'm here. The prices are reasonable and the food was tasty and made quickly. I will be back to try more dishes!"}
{"text":"I love chicken tikka masala and the chicken tikka masala here is great!  This place has a hint of Indian fusion with paneer in puff pastry.   I took my three year old here and there were loads of other kids eating dinner.  My son loved the food and he's never had Indian food before."}
{"text":"It wasn't that busy when I arrived, but was cosy like another reviewer said. I ordered a Sprite and a Papdi Chaat. Never had the dish before, but was pretty good. It wasn't expensive at all to me. Was worth the price and was a pleasant stop.  The only criticism I have is the people didn't seem very friendly and the music was so low I could barely hear it. Was very quiet in there."}
{"text":"I liked the food, it's not fancy but food is tasty. Desserts didn't look fresh which was disappointing."}
{"text":"My friend and I dined in. We ordered many things from the menu. The waiter was fantastic, and so nice. The food was a home run! It was so delicious! Everything that we tried was wonderful. We had a slice of butterscotch and a slice of blueberry cake. It was so light and delicious. I was hoping for a bit more Indian pastries in the cooler, but I can't complain. The restaurant was clean and nice. The gas fireplace was great. 5 stars."}
{"text":"I really like this place but I think their menu items aren't truly what are ordered. I ordered paneer tikka masala and received tikka masala... but with lots of veggies (broccoli and carrots) and very little paneer. The flavors were good but not what I ordered. I ordered a naan with it and received a poori roti type of bread. a bit hard (must have been microwaved to be reheated) but not naan. I enjoyed the food and it was tasty but definitely not what traditional items are. The food also has a very south Indian flavor to it and not north Indian."}
{"text":"The food is much better than the utah location as is the quantity. I liked the preparation as all where on the spicy side. Prices are very reasonable. Word of advice to management , make the pani puri worth ordering, both the filling and the quantity."}
{"text":"This is a great place.  My wife and I stopped in for a quick bite this evening.  The service was excellent and the speedy.  The decor is very modern and clean.  The location is a little tough to find, but once you're inside, the aroma is wonderful.  I needed a little help with the menus since there are some items on the menu that were a little different than I was used to when ordering at an Indian restaurant.  The kind lady and gentleman who are running this place were patient with me and guided me to some excellent choices.  Wow!  I was so impressed with the quality of the food and the flavors were so unique and pleasing.  Give this little gem a try, you will be glad you did."}
{"text":"Not the most authentic place, but love the ambiance cleanliness and overall vibe of this place. Nice to see a desi restaurant that is presentable and trendy"}
{"text":"This is a newly opened shop around bell road area.I am from India so I usually expect a lot when it comes to authenticity,however this place has some nack for giving you a snacks flairs of India.Things which I liked are Vada pav,Samosa. They can improve on their Veg Puff and veg Biryani.  Chai needs to be instructed the way one wants otherwise one usally gets it with loads of milk and less boiled."}
{"text":"I've been here about 3 times. Best biryani and chicken 65 in town! This is coming from someone raised on these dishes."}
{"text":"Came back to try the chili paneer pizza today which was simply delicious with a little spice kick.   Picked up mango and pineapple pastries which were both really good. Cake was moist with fresh icing. Hard to decide which one was better!"}
{"text":"The food here was awesome! Best Indian food I have had in a long time! Wonderful flavors. The reason for only 4 stars was that I had a long wait with no explanation. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I wish I could give 0 rating. Food here stinks. And for your and your family's safety., never take \"to go\" here. I once got rotten and stale puffs n that's the end of it. Don't risk your life."}
{"text":"The pastries and chicken puff were awesome. Very delicious CH puffs n black forest & pineapple pastries. Negative thing is had a long wait for even these ready to go items with not many customers. Portions are very small as compared to prices."}
{"text":"The food here isn't for this American who loves Indian food almost anywhere.  It could be that It's not Americanized.  The Naan was thin like a tortilla.  I'm not coming back.  They didn't even have syrup for the fountain drinks.  The Diet Coke, Coke and root beer were all running clear."}
{"text":"A great place to eat, we love this place for - 1. Great Biriyani 2. Awesome chaats 3. Great tasting chicken/mutton sukka 4. Unique tikka pizza 5. Nice smooth pastries (try pineapple) 6. Reasonable price  We always liked pastries and chaat (Bell rd), but this new location is much better as it has proper sitting arrangement. * Don't forget to use yelp check-in for 15% discount. * If you are a regular, enroll for there loyalty program"}
{"text":"We were excited that they opened a new store in Scottsdale and went there the first day. Tried their special chat and pizza which didn't taste good. But, since we visit a lot the one in phoenix. Wanted to give another try and came on their 3rd day. But, my mistake is i came almost by the closing time. I asked if they have biryani and i was told that they are not taking any orders. And when i asked about pastries, she said yes. So, I went there and was checking pastries. Waited for some time and later on i was bluntly told that the store is closed. I told that i have been waiting and the lady answered \"You are just waiting for 5mins\" and asked me to leave. The worst customer service i ever faced. At least there should be a way of rejecting. Very disappointing. I will never ever return to the store and will not recommend to any of my friends."}
{"text":"Food is actually pretty good and adjustments can be made easily according to our choice. Biryani is really good. Something's are pretty oily. Ordered their eggless cake once it was amazing. Sweets are good too. Service as such is quite slow. No place to sit it's too small. It's better to just takeaway, but it not possible all the time."}
{"text":"The first time I ate here, it was a crap shoot and had no idea what I had just ordered! No being too familiar with Indian cuisine, the menu (digital or paper) is confusing and does not explain what the menu items are or what is in them...anyone know what a Raju Gari Kodi Pulao is? The counter staff was of little help as I could barely understand them. The interior of the restaurant had a fresh, modern, \"corporate\" decor, devoid of stereotypical elements found in many Indian restaurants. Once you work thru the diamond in the rough called the ordering process, the food was pretty tasty and high quality to back it up.  Suggestions: 1. Before you go, be sure to study the menu in advance so you know what you are getting into. 2. Both times I ate here, I have been unable to determine if they sell beverages as I have been unable to find a soda machine or an option to buy soda...they do have a self-serve water dispenser off to the side with a stack of styrofoam cups on top. 3. Management: Organize the menu in such a way where it clearly explains how many items you get with your meal and what all your options are...pictures would be helpful (thank you Yelp!). 4. Management: Hire staff who speak enough English to walk folks who are new to this type of cuisine thru the menu and ordering process. 5. Management: Have some music or Bollywood playing in the background to cut thru the thick silence...it was so eerily quiet in there, I could hear the refrigerator motor running."}
{"text":"Vijayawada special biriyani is awesome. Their pastries are so soft and nice. They offer good catering too."}
{"text":"Great taste at every branch. Vijayawada special biriyani and mirchi bajji are my favourite. Pastries are nice and soft too."}
{"text":"This place was soooo crazy good!  Everything was amazing.  The staff was super friendly and helpful!  I can't wait to come back and try more items!  Be sure to check out the desserts as well!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed my first visit here today for lunch. The staff was very friendly and willing to explain the dishes on the menu. I tried the Special Non-Veg Thali which came in a delightful tray with multiple compartments of items to try. Everything was lovely and just spicy enough. My favorite by far was the Chicken Tikka Masala, some of the best I have ever tasted. I would definitely recommend you stop in and give them a try."}
{"text":"Pretty good!  Little language barrier on my part, but the food is as good as the picture I pointed out.  LOL"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a hidden gem, this is it! Good food and good prices. I had the Veg Thani Special (for dinner) and it was great! Perfectly spicy, and tons of food. For those \"spicy challenged\" people, you may want to check how spicy your dish is before you order.   Location is tucked back next to the Pieology, which is a blessing and a shame. The staff seem really nice too!  Critiques: Inside is dim and could use some up-keep."}
{"text":"Okay, it might be my mistake for ordering pastries at an Indian food place, but I wanted dessert and Postmates delivers.   I got 2 cakes, some type of chocolate pastry, and chocolate mousse.  ALL the cakes and pastries were gross.  They all tasted like they've been in a refrigerator with Indian food.  Shocker, I know.  The mousse was okay at least, no taste of Indian food.  Maybe the Indian food is better. :)"}
{"text":"Amazing!  I got Chicken Tikka, Mango Lassi, and Chai for $10. (The Chicken Tikka or Makhrani is called something else on the menu but they figured out what I wanted and gave me the special)  The Chicken Tikka came with yogurt (raita) and paratha bread. It was the perfect portion and I ate every last drop of that delicious curry. The paratha bread was the best I've had with layers of flakey carbs almost like a croissant. The Chai and Lassi at $1.79 each were small but hit the spot.  Place has a steady stream of indian customers ordering a variety of specials from Vada Pav to Thali.  I've always wanted to try this place since my college freshman year in 2010 and now that I've had the opportunity this place doesn't disappoint. (Now I'm mad I didn't discover it sooner xD) It is like an indian diner, food cart, and bakery rolled in one.  Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"This place is an A+!!! Great food and service, so glad this place opened in Chandler. The food was great, the decor was very nice and the restaurant was so clean. ***MOST OF ALL, we didn't walk out smelling like an indian restaurant!!! There was a really cute girl who served us she was very sweet I'm definitely coming back because of her hospitality alone!"}
{"text":"Well decorated and clean self serve restaurant. We filled out a card with our order and handed it in and found a table to sit at. The people who work here are polite and efficient. The chaat is the best I have had in Arizona in a very long time.  We had:  Irani Samosas - Nice  Dahi Batata Puri - Amazing! The yogurt is creamy, the puris are crunchy and fresh and the chtunies have the perfect flavor.  House Special #3 - Very nice. The Kheema was flavorful, the puris were just right and not greasy  Pineapple pastry - Very nice. Moist and just the right level of sweetness.  We are planning on coming here often."}
{"text":"I'm used to coming here since it's close to work and the biryani tastes good. But what I'm turned off by these days is the 1 hour wait time to get our food! This is not a one off situation, it has been happening for the last 5 visits. Our group has decided it's not worth it and we won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"Mine & my daughters first time here.....service and food was great....very spicy which I like but not so my my daughter. The Chicken puffs were really good. Food was out within less than 10 mins which was great. Chicken pizza was good very spicy after 2 pieces.I will come back and trying something different and some dessert next time"}
{"text":"One of the best snack places in Phoenix. Loved the egg puff, paneer 65 and their \"sultani chicken\" dum biryani was amazing. I would definitely recommend this place if you like Indian food big time. Try their appetizers, all are amazing. We were a group of 5, ordered chat also including samosa chat, pani puri and dahi puri. Absolutely loved it"}
{"text":"It was okay...felt the food wasn't that great tasting and lots of oil!"}
{"text":"Update: the actual owner messaged me and apologized for the service. Bumping up my review by two stars. ----------------------------  Horrible service! Avoid peak hours to avoid their glaring incompetency in running the place.  We ordered two chaats and a lassi. The owner rang up the bill didn't even bother tell me how much I need to pay or if I need a receipt. 50 mins passed by and nothing! I stop by the counter and he says \"order 37, yeah, coming up\". 15 more mins and nothing yet! I checked again at the counter this time, he now says they ran out of one of the chaats on the order and says he'll give something else!! At the end of it all he dint even break out an apology for the delay! Unacceptable!!! Go to Little India instead."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! I recently traveled to India and this was like coming home! Love love Love  the manager is lovely  you must try every so come back! But for sure try the mango lassi ! You will love it!"}
{"text":"Good place for some snacks and a light dinner. You get the Indian kind of pastries and also a couple of Indian sodas. Egg puffs are the best. Chai came in a huge cup would have probably enjoyed it better if the quantity was less ."}
{"text":"What a nice place to get an fun Indian lunch! I got the Indian pizza and it was awesome! We also got some of the astries- strawberry cake is the best! Very light and moist!"}
{"text":"Sweet little place for quick Indian snacks and light fare. With a cafe style seating, the ambience is good for couples or a small group. Most people seem to come in for a to-go order. Last time we were here, my husband got the vegetable puff while I got the Bhel Puri. The Bhel Puri was good, the puff was average. We also tried the vegetarian Biryani which was delicious. The quantity of the Biryani is worth the price. Next time, I would like to try their eggless cakes and pastries on display."}
{"text":"Ulavacharu biriyani is very good here. Tried the vegetarian version. Will be coming here often."}
{"text":"This place has the best chicken biryani, very consistent, always very fresh. Lots of chicken, lovely rice. I tried the cake today, it's chocolate and perfect. Talented people making the cakes. Woman at front is always great customer service. You will be happy you tried here(:"}
{"text":"This review is based on a take out order that I received via postmates. I have driven past this place every time we go to the dog park. I attempted to visit this place once, but they were closed for break. Their door was unlocked and the employees were sitting at the tables doing nothing. We were turned away. I thought it was weird how NONE of the employees mentioned that they would be open again in 20 minutes. This is my only service experience for this place.   I ordered the tikka paneer special that came with rice, paratha, raita, and onion. There was plenty of paneer and the flavor was delicious. All that food for $6.99! What a deal! Of course I had to have the chaat - I got the samosa chaat. It was such a wonderful blend of flavors. Mind you, I've never had chaat before, so I have nothing to compare it to. It was quite \"hot\" spicy, and I was pretty full from the curry - but I can't wait to have its left overs tomorrow! I also ordered a slice of mango cake. I was thoroughly impressed with the cake. It was not too sweet and the cake was so perfectly spongy and moist. I also received a container of white stuff....it had some cheese like substance in it - in the shape of one of those babybel cheeses. If anyone knows what I'm talking about, let me know what it is! I tried it...but I'm not sure my palette knew how to respect it.     I'm very curious about the pizzas. I'll definitely be back here!"}
{"text":"A couple of co-workers and I visited this restaurant for lunch the other day. We ordered Chicken Biryani and a variety of smaller Chaat and appetizer dishes to share and eat family-style at our table.  During the checkout process, the Point of Sale system asked for a tip/gratuity, so we each left a decent tip on our share of the bill (our bill was around $40, and we gave a 15% tip of $6).  We went to our table and waited for the food to be brought to us. As it turned out, the food was quite tasty and we enjoyed our meal. At this point in time, I would definitely have returned to the restaurant. That all changed, however...  After the meal was over and we were walking out the door, the man at the register rudely yelled at us, demanding that we clean up our table.  This shocked all of us. Why were we asked for a tip, if there was going to be zero service, and patrons are expected to bus their own tables as if it was a fast food restaurant?  I'm used to cleaning up after myself at fast food restaurants, but any restaurant that expects a tip (and blatantly asks for one up front) should be expected to provide at least some level of service!  Additionally, I have never in my entire life been yelled at by a restaurant staff member (fast food or otherwise) for not cleaning up the table when I left!  Whoever owns this restaurant apparently completely lacks an understanding of how tips are supposed to work in America. If you ask for a tip and happily pocket the money, then you are expected to provide service in exchange, or else you are essentially just stealing from people! It's straight up dishonest and misleading business practice.  Edit: The owner of the restaurant messaged me directly on yelp to apologize for the bad experience (which I appreciated), and he has assured me that he will take action to ensure this sort of thing doesn't happen again. As such, I have updated my review to 3 stars, and will give the restaurant another try here in the future! The food really was quite tasty!"}
{"text":"Ordered chicken sukka and paneer 65.. loved it.. the taste was so good that we ordered chicken sukka and mutton sukka the following week.. it was equally good as the first time. Which makes me believe the consistency is good."}
{"text":"The specialty here is the amazing cakes. I love all of them! As authentic as you'll ever get! And I love all the different chat too.  Today's visit was amazing. Subu, the cashier, was so kind! It was my 4 year old kids' birthdays and he kept high fiving them and made them feel super special. It was like meeting an old friend.  I spoke with the baker too for a custom Cake for the kids. He was so nice and pretty much can make any type of design you require and gives suggestions too.  We left with 5 slices of extra cake. You really must have all the slices! Glad to have this gem in AZ :-)"}
{"text":"This place is super awesome. Loved the food. Service is usually quick. Lot of variety and portions are good too. And this place is actually close to good Indian food."}
{"text":"Very good Indian food close to home. Had 2 different samosas and both were delish! Orders the Panera tikka pizza (kids are it all) we had the chicken biryani rice. *note this is spicy* I didn't ask for extra spice and it definitely had a kick. We do like spicy food, but if you don't maybe ask for it to be milder.    Also they specialize in pastries - all looked great but we had so much food and no room left for dessert.    I ordered to go and while staff is friendly, it did take about 30 min. before my entire order was out. I'm not complaining bc I know indian food takes a while to prepare, but want to give you the heads up incase you're pressed for time.    We will go back and try some more dishes.  Also, pricing was average. Samosas were around $3-4 that included 2/ea.  The pizza was around $7 and Biryani was $11.  Had the chai too but it was weak. Cost around $1.75"}
{"text":"Wonderful service and amazing authentic Indian food. Could not ask for a better experience. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I order take-out from there very often as their Chaat is good and perfect add on as an appetizer for a luncheon.  I am writing this review as the people working there are obnoxiously rude and unprofessional. I placed a take-out order last night that was around $150, I received a call saying order is ready so I went to pick it up.  When I reached their, my 14 pastries were not packed and the Chaat order was incorrect.  Their were 2 people working behind the counter.  The younger one argued with me that I ordered Ragra Chaat and not Dahi Chaat.  He was so upset over it and kept on arguing.  Then he went back and got a big foil container of yogurt and told me to put this over my Chaat.  When I asked about the other toppings that went into Chaat, he told me to use what was left over from my Pain Puri mix.  I insisted he give me chutneys, and with a lot of struggle he did.  Then I told him I wanted extra Pani for the Pani Puri.   Told him twice that he is welcome to charge me, but still he was not happy so he gave me half a container of extra Pani.  I asked why he has a problem when I'm ready to pay, but he had no response.  After I paid for my order, both the employees watched me make 6 trips to my car to put the food, and even though they were standing idle neither of them offered to have the courtesy to assist in loading the car.  I was disgusted, to say the least!  Will never return!"}
{"text":"This great fancy street food indian restaurant has been open since April and I am just now hearing about it? Shame in my yelping skills.   I came here with my bf and we loved this place. Wasnt a huge fan of the pizza but other than thateverything was amazing.   So down to what i ate: Briyani - omg the meat falls off of the bone. The spice on the rice is on point Pizza - could have a little more spice Gulab Jaman - yum yum. I wish i would of had them warm White Forest Cake - sooo goood  All in all excellent. New favorite indian food place."}
{"text":"We ordered Samosa Chaat, Dahi Batata Puri and an asortment of Indian sweets.  Every thing was wonderful.  The samosa was spicy and the puri had this great yogurt in it.  The sweets reminded me of marzipan.  I could not have been happier.  Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Wonderful addition to the area.  Food was exceptionally fresh and delivered quickly.  We sat in the restaurant and it was pleasant and clean.  I am a little skittish when ordering Indian since it can still be a little intimidating.  But the food that we picked was about as good as it gets.  The basmati rice was wonderful and the 1 piece of NAN that we got wasn't enough because it was so great!  Then the owner brought us a slice of cake to share.  I had no intention on having desert, but she didn't have a hard time convincing me otherwise.  It was phenomenal!!!    We will be back...probably very soon.  SOOO GOOD!"}
{"text":"I made 2nd visit to it and must say it was satisfying this time. Ordered Paneer tikka pizza and mango pastry, must admit both orders were delicious. All in all this is a new setup and the owner is open to recommendations and suggestions. They need support to serve the valley. Pizzas and pastries are a must if you visit this place."}
{"text":"went to pastries and chaat for chicken biryani and it was very good. Asked if I could have it little spicy and it turned out to be at the perfect spice level. Good job pastries and chaat will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Today I checked In at this restaurant to give a party to my colleagues (20 in count). They arranged good tables near the sit out where I can enjoy both food and climate. I am glad that they managed all the 20 people and served food really fast and hot.  I ordered multiple items that too in different different spice levels. Everything was perfect as I desired. No confusion in ordering and moreover I am glad that they gave me reward points and got some times for free (Redeemed Points). The front office girl did a great job to handle the crowd, She was taking orders in the same she was also managing to serve pastries.   I would prefer this restaurant if you are giving lunch treats to your friends and office colleges."}
{"text":"Chicken dum biriyani ,pastry and chai was pretty good ,expected spice level for Hyderabadi biriyani but it'd be great if the chicken is a bit more cooked and provide knives at the table,it was my first time there would definitely go there sometime again. Overall it's a pretty cool ,neat place to hangout"}
{"text":"Ordered vada paav but ended up getting Dahi paapdi. Food tastes alright but the quantity is way too less for the price."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, fast service, food is delicious as well as the baked goods, will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great service and cute atmosphere. I thought the food was bland but the price was great and the portions were perfect. I will try again and update."}
{"text":"My new favorite Indian food! So good. It's Indian street food so not the extensive menu that some Indian restaurants have - but they have plenty. We had the goat Bryani and Peppered fish - both were great! Very flavorful. We'll definitely be back to try everything else."}
{"text":"Love the vegetarian Thali. Good service, clean and good atmosphere, and great desserts!"}
{"text":"We just had the mango Lassi, rasmalai, and gulab jamun. It was sooo good! It was great to be able to get a fresh mango lassi here in Phoenix. We will definitely be trying the Pastry and Chaat in Chandler as well and can't wait to get their savory options next time."}
{"text":"Tasty Indian fast food. Had the pani puri, Bhel puri, pav bhaji and desserts.  Facility was clean. Staff was courteous and attentive.  Would come back here again.  Bathrooms smell a little."}
{"text":"All of the food I had here was excellent! I ordered the non-veg platter (with Chicken Tikka Masala curry today), the the goat sukka and a ras malai. Yum! The people there were also very nice and helpful. I had forgotten to use the 10% code, but was reminded before paying. The restaurant is brand new and very clean. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Having been to India, I was delighted to find good Indian food at reasonable prices. Nothing fancy and a limited menu, but this place made me happy. The ginger goat was quite well spiced and the ginger panner is outstanding. Our friend had a veg puff and a veggie rice dish. Then came the delight of their house made pastries. By the way, the chai is quite decent."}
{"text":"There were baby cockroaches running around on the tables and the wall next to the booth. I got sick from the food."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience!!   The food and service were both first rate.  Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"So out of many cuisines we decided to go for chat and that to this restaurant looking at the reviews. Our food was tasty except pav bhaji.. too much garam masala. BUT SERVICE WAS . The restaurant closes at 9, and we were about to be done & the lady comes at 9.01 and says we are closed and she would like us to leave. What the heck?????? Who would say like that when you are 5 minutes from getting done... for service I give 3"}
{"text":"We tried samosa chaat and the chicken curry combo plate. Now I expected that for 5 dollars samosa chaat would be 2 samosas but uh uh came with one. Taste wise it was alright nothing like authentic indian chaat. Coming to the chicken curry plate, comes with a paratha, pulav, chicken curry. we were disappointed that the roti  (bread) was the frozen type. I mean seriously for 7 dollars I have been to places that serve excellent fresh Naan and delicious curry. Chicken curry was the only good thing of the combo plate. It could have been a 4 star rating since it's really good taste and a decent place to sit but for the roti and slightly high price for one samosa in the chaat."}
{"text":"I was in the area the other day and very hungry.  I saw a Thai place and nearby this place.  I decided on the Indian.  I had the Samosa Chaat and the Apollo fish appetizer.  I really enjoyed the fish, very spicy but not too hot and decent portion.   The Samosa Chaat was a very nice looking dish but I actually got bored eating this after a while.  I was disappointed in their limited menu, not much to choose from if you are trying to stay away from carbs.  I would get the fish app again and also would try the chicken.  I was the only customer so service was not an issue!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Spicy and tasty!!!! Loved their Briyani!  I'll be back for the Thali.   Definitely a great stop for an Indian meal!  Friendly and attentive staff, too!!!  If for any reason if you were not satisfied, I think they would take good care of you.  I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"I order Vijayawada biryani frequently from PnC. Usually the biryani is hot and taste very nice tempting to order more. But today , it was disappointing as the taste was not up to usual good taste and even food seems to be not that fresh. the masala sauce gave a burnt smell. This is the 2nd time i have had similar experience."}
{"text":"It reminds me of my favorite bakery back home. They have a better biriyani than a bunch of other restaurants I know of."}
{"text":"Expensive! ! They never have everything on the menu. Clean and friendly though. I don't like all the plastic wares. Small portion but tastes like India."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service! Will never go back. Ordered desserts to go and the service was terrible. Will never return again. Doesn't matter how good pastries are the service is deplorable."}
{"text":"Very bad customer service. Food quality is not that great too. Make sure you take receipt for your purchase and check. They charged me double. Busy rush hour pick up time like Friday evening , they r all over the place . Hopefully they improve their service and attitude or it's not too far that we see this restaurant going down. Be vigilant when you go there. If you are picking up food, make sure it's same dish you ordered. Many times they change ."}

{"text":"Best Indian food in town. Hands down. Amazing biriyani, amazing appetizers. This is the closest we can get to authentic Indian food. Service is great. I like their rewards program! We've been here sooo many times and this place not even once disappointed us! Highly recommended for everyone."}
{"text":"Few items good in the menu. Very unprofessional staff. If they are closing at 9 pm then it's not their kitchen closing at that time, but rather the whole restaurant. You go there 20 mins before closing time, you order your food and get it 10-15 min later, but in 5 mins they'll kick you out.   They will also accept online orders 15 min before closing time. And then later they'll cancel it. Not going there ever again. Neither are any of the people I know."}
{"text":"The boneless chicken biriyani was terrible.. The chicken biriyani had hardly any chicken pieces in it. It was like eating tasteless colored rice!! Definitely not worth the price. The service also was also poor. The place was not even half full yet they took a long time to serve. Would not want to go back again!"}
{"text":"I will steer clear of the Chandler location, I went to cater for a party and they were literally writing up a menu for double the number of people I asked for, stating all kind of reasons and wrote up a total of $600. I ended up ordering the same food and an extra starter from Kabab Palace for $315. Then I realized he was making me pay for more food, food that he may not have delivered. So overall my experience wasn't so pleasant."}
{"text":"I think your experience at pastries and chaat will be very different depending on what you order. I went with a few friends and we tried 3 different cakes. We had one that was a light honey and nut kind of cake...this thing was so delicious! Light, airy, flavorful in a nuanced way...just great. The other two flavors I tried were not so good. Those were the chocolate cake and the red velvet cake.... This may have been our faults for ordering those kinds of desserts from this kind of bakery, but they offer them so we figured why not. Both of these cakes were dense and heavy. They lacked chocolatey richness and instead were somewhat bland. If you hit this place up, be careful what you order, but I'd definitely recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"Okay so this is the only place that has the real Indian taste to it  Very clean and excellent dining area  To make it short only Indian place that's worth going"}
{"text":"What a great little place. The server was very helpful with ordering and very honest when we wanted to over order. Haha. We will be visiting this place again.  Food was very good and huge portions."}
{"text":"Craving some Indian food, I got some items to go and eat throughout the week. Overall I thought the food was pretty good for the prices, if I were to consider it as quick service or fast food, but definitely not the best Indian food out there. The chicken biryani was a good level of spicy, but didn't have too much complexity in the other spices like I have had at other places. The chicken tikka was very oily and the chicken in it was quite tough, compared to the chicken in the biryani, which was plentiful and well seasoned. The rice and roti that came with it were okay, but I don't think I would get the tikka again. I also got an order bhel puri, which I did like. I'll probably try some more things from here like the pizza and give it another shot."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite place for Biryani. Very Tasty and spicy. Chats are mouth watering. And I love cut mirchi. Staff is very friendly and service is very good. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Even if you think you don't like Indian food, go here and order either the Chili Chicken Tikka Pizza or the Chili Chicken Pizza (or both).  Order a large side of Raita (yogurt sauce) and a large side of the green chutney (mint chutney).  Thank me later.  I usually take my order to go because I would be embarrassed for the patrons in the restaurant to watch me eat like I haven't tasted food before.  It's that good."}
{"text":"I love this place.. Big Fan of Chicken Sukha and Nawabi Chicken Biryani...love their pastries and birthday cakes are really tasty... I am glad they opened up in Chandler and love their decor as well.. Totally recommend"}
{"text":"I had some chaat and it tasted good but the pastries are horrible. Way too much sugar. They were inedible and we had to throw them out. I may go back to try some of their other dishes but not their bakery."}
{"text":"This is a new location which opened recently. I was there couple of times, appetizers are the ones which stand out. Kheema Biryani was good. Boneless biryani is a joke, you just fry some pieces and put in the biryani even the pieces are black in color, same experience 2 times. Now I get a chicken curry for $5 which is as small as dessert portion. I'm better off spending my $5 at Burger King. If you name the dish as Mint curry please let it taste like one."}
{"text":"DO NOT COME HERE!!!!! Customer service is HORRIBLE! The chaat was no good, took them about 20 minutes to make.. While I was ordering the man with the unibrow kept telling me to wait because he had phone calls to answer and did not apologize for having me wait 10 minutes just to order my food! When I finally had enough of waiting I went up to unibrow man and asked to get my money back and, being the greedy person he was, he said \"no money can be returned\" and I was pissed that this fool is running a business and hasn't the slightest clue on how to deal with customers.. I do not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Finally decided to stop in here and get something to eat. The owners or workers do not speak the best English and it's a little difficult to have them suggest some of their more popular dishes. Tried a few different ones but they turned out to be basically the same dish. One of the dishes that chicken was very dry and hard almost inedible. The other dish the chicken was good but had lots of little bones spread throughout the rice. Made eating a little bit of a challenge. I did enjoy the vegetable samosas. They also have some interesting looking desserts. If I do make it back maybe I will try one of the pizzas or a combo dish."}
{"text":"Avoid it like the plague! Every dish was stale - chaat needs to be fresh and you won't get that here."}
{"text":"The ambience is very pleasing (I visited their place on bell road) and the host/ waiter who received me was very friendly giving you the right options to choose from and also providing good offers for the day. I should say that I am not a fan of their main course items. I ordered Mysore masala dosa and I felt they should definitely improvise their flavour. The batter by itself lacked something. The chutneys were pretty good. We get free chai on every purchase here. I liked their chai a lot. The chaat here is pretty good. I had dahi papdi chaat once and the quantity is so good that, you can make it your meal. The next time, I ordered pav bhaji pizza hoping that it would be like the one of the desi pizzas I had in the Bay Area. I wasn't so pleased with this as it had lot of oil dripping off the sides. I could use 3 kitchen tissue papers to blot of all its oil. I didn't get the Pav bhaji taste until I fixed my mind that it's something related to Pav bhaji. Like I said, if they improve their flavour level I would definitely re-try these items and give a better review for sure! Do go there for chaat like their name suggests. Happy chaating!!  Update about pastries: As far as pastries are concerned, it's not that great. I went there expecting fresh Black Forest cake. But all I got was dried sponge with some cream in between. A layer actually fell off before I even finished the cake. Very disappointed with the pastry."}
{"text":"great food. best dahi batata puri ... pizzas are good. the chole stuff is ok"}
{"text":"Have ordered from here a few times and the service is great. If you order, to-go during peak hours, be prepared to wait around 45 minutes for your food. If you order one of their pizzas, it'll be done and cold before the rest of your order, so beware. Spiciness is spot-on, which is a plus. Pretty much a crap-shoot when you order from here. Went again last week and same thing happened again. I understand the need to get orders out, but why make the pizza so far ahead of time and let it get cold?"}
{"text":"If you like Indian \"chaat\" you will most definitely like this place. For any newbies out there, chaat is the term used for small finger foods which are usually eaten as snacks or with coffee/tea in the evenings.   My go to is the samosa chaat - a crushed samosa mixed with chickpeas, delicious yogurt sauce, and onions, crispies, and garnishes. You can also get a couple other variations such as sev puri, etc. Regardless, I think the food here is solid. Not the best that I've had but definitely a good option if you're having the craving.   Aside from chaat, just remember they also have other items on their menu such as Thalis, curries, biryani, and so forth."}
{"text":"Excellent and food was really good. I never had this kind of biriyani in the US. the resturant environment recollects my student Life... the person who takes billing he was nice and vgood to customers !"}
{"text":"Food is not that great... v ordered dahi puri it was all filled with onions and no matar in it... webordered biryani that was also average... the only thing i liked there was rasmalai"}
{"text":"The male at the desk wouldn't get off his iPhone and help me as I was standing there for about three minutes. Finally looked at me and said \"what do you need\". As I bit my lip and walked out the door, they don't need my money."}
{"text":"This place serves one of the best biryanis I had in Arizona! I'm a vegetarian. The chat, especially Pav Bhaji, Vegetarian dum biryani, Paneer biryani tastes awesome. I have tried this place both in Chandler and Tempe. Both of them are good."}
{"text":"Expensive..  small portions... wait mins over 30...  panipuri had salty water and tasted like made with readymade masala... cold food... veg combo had frozen paratha!! Cmon! Paneer tikka pizza nt wrth it...   Only food item i wud cm back is pastry n also puff coz there is no other good option in d valley..  for all chat and curry combos i wud go to lotus deli anytime or even little india..  Dahi batata puri was the only saving grace it was really good n tasty... which btw they had forgotten and finally arrived almost an hour later when we were abt to leave... one other good thing... all the waiters were really working hard to serve everyone.."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick bite of delicious Indian street food! Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Awesome food !!! Love it !!! Everything is good and tasty !!! Recommend everyone to try it !!"}
{"text":"This place is bad! 2 piece samosa chaat is 6.99 + tax. The pani puri is all pani, there was one piece of potato in each one the size of a dime. If you are new to Indian food, I guess you could try this place. But for those of us with a more refined Indian palate, food is tasteless and expensive."}
