{"text":"I pass this place daily. For a while I thought it was closed or closing.  It is that unassuming.  A sense of desertion?  Anyway.  I love breakfast and finding ANY place, especially locally owned that beats IHOP is a win.  Breakfast shouldn't be overpriced, over-hyped or overly self important. I want value, good service, and a consistently well executed product.  If you don't need palatial surroundings then here's a great spot.  Decor is dated but VERY clean. Close observation and no dust in nooks and crannies.  Same can't be said about more popular establishments.  Menu is simple.  I was there for breakfast. Service was quick and attentive.  Genuine with out being intrusive or annoying.  If you find a place where the servers write out tickets and you hand them to a cashier (no POS system) chances are the lack of tech upgrades have not kept them from maintaining an efficient and effective staff that's bound to cultivate regulars.  Not once did I have to rubberneck to get refills, extra napkins etc.  Service is great enough to know what you want and give it to you when you need it. If you want more, your momma should wait on you.  THAT is value."}
{"text":"Three strikes, you're out. Have givin this place a few tries with no luck. Service not good. Hey staff,  just a tip,  when ordering a salad,  people typically want it before the meal. Food wasn't bad though, maybe it's just time for carry out."}
{"text":"FOR THE most part they are wonderful! decent prices for a good amount of food! i love the ribeye steak. its big with eggs bread and grits for only $9. you absolutely can't beat that"}
{"text":"This place was very, very, disappointing. My hubby took me here for breakfast on my bday an I ordered an veggie egg white omelette. I was brought an eggless omelette; there was no egg & a plate full of veggie. I was told I should have told my waitress to add more egg. AH, OK, this was my 1st time here & how was I suppose to know the cook didn't get permission from the owner Dino to add another egg. I ordered something else,WHICH DINO , try to charge me for the my order and double the price of my 2nd order. I end up eating nothing from here. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY at this HOLE IN THE WALL. Go to a real 4 or 5 star breakfast spot like flying biscuit,ihop, or ferns.."}
{"text":"Nasty food the server i had was very rude I wouldn't recommend coming here. The breakfast i ordered was cold. It was very unpleasant."}
{"text":"This is a reg lunch spot for my coworkers and I. The food is amazing and good prices for how much food you get! The staff rocks and they will leave pitchers of sweet tea!! We love the place!"}
{"text":"A lot of food for your money! Family operated. Looks like a hole in the wall, but it is delicious!"}
{"text":"Had the breakfast special Grits bacon eggs and biscuits it was delicious and filling and at great price. No doubt I will Be coming back again and again"}
{"text":"Dino's is a greasy spoon without the grease. Breakfast is the way to go. The menu is short & sweet with a wide selection of meats, including liver & country ham, to accompany your eggs. The grits are heaven - creamy, flavorful & plentiful. The food comes out lickity split too. Perhaps best of all is the service. Attentive servers are always there to refill coffee & check on your meal. You get a real motherly vibe from them & even of they don't always smile, they are damn good at what they do."}
{"text":"With a name like family restaurant I was expecting baked chicken, meatloaf, comfort foods. It is really an Italian restaurant.  Pizza, Italian style subs, etc. the food was good but change the name to Dino's Italian Restaraunt !  Service was good also"}
{"text":"was here for breakfast two sundays ago. this place is really really old and can use a remodel. the waitress was very sweet and the place looked clean. they seem to have a few regulars. i have an omlette with homfries and toast. the omlette was ok but the homefries were greasy and gross. prices were good. the coffee was good. I probably wont go back but overall the experience was not bad."}
{"text":"I have lunch today whit my sister. I eat house grill  chicken salad. And my sister order chicken parmesan. Love it"}
{"text":"We stopped based on other reviews on Yelp.  While it is not fine dining, the food was hot and tasty.  I can't wait to try breakfast.  The staff makes the place.  They are polite, caring people taking great care of their customers."}
{"text":"Good portions, friendly service, plenty of seating, large selection.  The food is good and they will prepare everything as you request with no problems.  No frills or fire works here, just a place to eat.  The decor is very dated and the booths can get crowded with 4 adults."}
{"text":"The food is not good, I tried an omelet and the cheese taste weird. Place needs an update."}
{"text":"pancakes were dry. Heard waitresses cursing. Service was ok. I won't return. Biscuits burnt. Best thing was the toast :)"}
{"text":"Was in Charlotte for a funeral and found Dino's on Yelp. We had a party of five and every-bodies food came out hot and tasted great. The service was outstanding. Everything was perfect. Will go again next time I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Wonderful and very pleasant service here.  Wow... I give 10 of 10.  Server name: Beth... And everyone else.  Great work.    As for the food here...  bacon egg and cheese on rye bread: I give 8 of 10.  It was not greasy at all and a very delicious breakfast sandwich.      Grits with two eggs, biscuits with gravy... Butter milk pancakes with a smoked sausage:  Gravy was my favorite.  I loved how eggs and grits were not greasy at all and delicious.  Now... Pancake was a little dry and it had a bitter taste at the end ( probably baking soda). Biscuit was alright.  I could defiantly tell they make their biscuits here.   I order breakfast this time but Lunch looked good. I may try that next time.   And the best part is ...the price.  Total came out $18 and some change.  Wow... And the bathrooms were clean.   I defiantly recommend this place.  Enjoy..."}
{"text":"Excellent low key breakfast/lunch spot. This is my go to over waffle house when it's open. Huge portions and good prices"}
{"text":"The food was cooked to perfection! The service was amazing! And at this place you can get more bang for your buck! Now one of my new favs in Charlotte.:"}
{"text":"I was looking for a good diner for breakfast, and it fits the bill.  Sodas are in a can, and kind of pricey considering that, so coffee or tea is a better drink.  Food was quick, hot and tasty (though sadly the bacon was only ok), and my waitress was attentive.  The decor is not fancy, but that's fine with me, as everything was clean that I saw, and that counts more.  If you want solid simple food that fills you up in a similar setting, this is your place."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great  Italian food.  The service is excellent.  This is authentic Italian and they give you LARGE portions .  A must  if you are in the Afton Ridge area."}
{"text":"Straight up,  no frills country diner/restaurant.   Located in an industrial section on Sugar Creek Rd., the prices are very reasonable,  food is good, and the service excellent.   Around Charlotte places like Dino's are throw backs to a simpler,  less sophisticated way of life when good food and good values were synonymous with working hard for a days pay.   The places that have survived may appear a little worn down, but they still put forth a decent plate at a great price.   I say let's support them!  Credit cards accepted."}
{"text":"Can anyone tell me if this restaurant has a bar and/or serves alcohol? Thanks!"}
{"text":"This is 1 of my Favorite places to eat got workers, our regular lady is the best. Great eating & their breakfast plate or my god. Would recommend Dino's to eat at"}
{"text":"Local greasy spoon with friendly service and good prices. Nothing super special but a solid choice over IHOP or Denny's."}
{"text":"I gave this place a one star but I should've really gave this place a zero. Me and my mother went to lunch yesterday at this place and everything actually was good I've been here before this visit would probably be my 6th time coming here...I didn't eat all my food so I took the rest of it home, I ordered the Dino's special which is grilled chicken with mushrooms onions and peppers with rice and gravy on the side...and it comes with two sides so I got double order of okra. After I warmed the food up later that evening and started eating my food in the mix of it all I found a screw and bolt in my food! Being that their hours are 630a-230p they were already closed...as I tried to called them and at least leave a voice msg regarding the issue...to give them a heads up I was coming in the morning when they opened...I brought the box and food back up this a.m. and asked to speak with a manager which was an older man had to be about 70 years old there was a waitress at the front that got him and asked what was wrong... I told her the situation she was like oh my god! So he walks over the manager that is and just looks at the food  and asked the waitress what was the dinner I received not apologizing to me or anything she said the Dino's special so he just handed over 7$ I was like sir I paid 10.66 total for my meal he says to me what about the okra and the tea I said sir are u serious?! I could get sick from a nasty dirty screw and bolt in my food and your worried about 2.66$ so the waitresses says ma'am we are refunding you the Dino's special portion...I said wow so he then added an additional dollar no apology so sympathy or anything! The owners at this place are rude and the waitresses always have to vouch for everything they do. She apologized Horrrrrrrible customer service handling this incident. I'm still debating if I should call channel 9 and report this place."}
{"text":"Food is over priced. Their menu isn't anything to brag about.  But for what it costs here.. Go down the road to the Olive Garden and eat well."}
{"text":"Better than average Italian  We were in the area at lunchtime today doing some shopping at Super Target and since this is right across the lot, decided to give them a try.  Typical Greek/Italian restaurant but with a good selection. We started wtih Mozzarella sticks as an appetizer and while they were very good, the marinara sauce stole the show.  The best I have had in a very long time.  You could taste the freshness of the tomatoes.  My wife opted for a NY Stomboli and while I have burgers a couple of times this week, all of which were horrible, I decided to take a chance and give theirs a try.  Glad I did because it was excellent and with a good char flavor just like you get on a backyard grill.  The fries on the otherhand need a lot of work.  They were undercooked and soggy and probably some of the worst I have had again in a long time.  My wife Stromboli was excellent and the portions were hugh. A lot more than even i could have eaten in one sitting.  Service was very good and the atmosphere was typical Greek/American decorated with touches of the old country.  Very good and we will be back."}
{"text":"This place is a perfect dive restaurant for breakfast or lunch on the weekend. The staff is extremely friendly and prompt, the food is not high class but it is exactly what you would want in a place like this especially given the low to moderate prices."}
{"text":"Dino's Family Restaurant is a hidden gem in the Sugar Creek area of Charlotte! This family-owned establishment has been a part of the north Tryon landscape for over 30 years. For me, the food at local restaurants just tastes better! Maybe it's just the good vibes I get from supporting local business.  I love diners, and Dino's is the epitome of a \"New York-style\" Greek-owned diner. The breakfast options were delicious and incredibly affordable--and available all day! My group ordered a Western omelette, eggs and a pork chop, and a short stack of hotcakes. The portions were giant, the food came out nice and hot, and the hotcakes were absolutely delicious. And it was all for $23--about $8/person.  While I didn't have lunch or dinner, the menus had plenty of options, sandwiches, burgers, and daily specials that come with a choice of two side vegetables, hot rolls, corn muffins, and a cup of soup. Specials included Ribeye Steak, Chicken Parmigiana, Fried Chicken Fingers, and Beef Liver. Sides included hot and cold choices such as Collard Greens, Potato Salad, or Sweet Peas. I met the owner Constantine (Dino himself!) who was very friendly and happy to answer any questions about the diner. For dinner he suggested Dino's Special Grilled Chicken Tenders with onions, peppers, and mushrooms over rice.   Of course, Dino's is a diner, so if coffee and a sweet treat is what you seek you will be all set. The coffee is rich, hot, and constantly flowing, and there is both pie AND banana pudding...my most favorite thing in the whole word.  If you are looking for a quick homestyle meal, skip IHOP or Shoney's, support local biz, and try Dino's Family Restaurant. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars????  If you like Denny's, they have a similar breakfast but the bathrooms and decor are horrifying.  No doubt the people are nice but nothing especially good about the food to give such a high rating.  Asked for sugar free syrup for pancakes, no dice.  Coffee is as pain as can be...and no urgency to refill by staff.  I use yelp to determine a true score.  In my opinion Deno has been posting all of his own reviews because no-one would rate this Resturant anything above a 3. I a person rated above this place above a 3, they probable don't use Yelp.  Sorry Deno but put some money into your Resturant because cheep only goes so far!"}
{"text":"I went for lunch and the food was so simple and so delicious. I felt like a kid again eating a home cooked meal. You get a huge amount of food for a great price. My mouth is still watering but my stomach can't absorb any more."}
{"text":"Absolutely adore breakfast here.  Food comes quickly and is enough to keep me full for most of the day.  Fantastic omelets, hash browns, and biscuits (my usual, it seems).  It is an unassuming, friendly place."}
{"text":"Every aspect of our breakfast at Dino's was phenomenal. As some other reviews have mentioned, the staff were incredibly kind, warm, and attentive. The waitress for our table was vigilante about refilling coffee and water cups, and she gave us four extra halves of fresh buttered toast on the house!  The food came out incredibly quickly. And every single thing was incredibly delicious. The one item that stood out above the rest was the biscuit gravy. If you have a meal here you should seriously consider incorporating the gravy into your meal somehow, it was phenomenal.  Lastly, the menu is reasonably priced, arguably cheap. I paid $9 before tip for two eggs, two pork chops, hash browns and toast. I think the biscuit with gravy (generous portion) was around $2, not positive though."}
{"text":"Dinos is great. I have eat there probably a hundred times never had a bad meal. Had everything from the subs to the pizza to the pasta, its all good. Ive turned several friends on to it its all they talk about during the week is hitting dinos on the weekends. I even have one friend that drives an hour away to eat here"}
{"text":"I stopped here for lunch while in the Sugar Creek area. Had a couple of pork chops with 2 vegetables, soup, and a choice of rolls/cornbread for a good price. Food was delicious, the sweet tea was good, and the service was spot-on. I've stayed away from it in the past because of its appearance, but I think it fits in well with the area and I wish I had stopped by sooner."}
{"text":"Found this place in our own neighborhood thanks to Yelp.  Great breakfast spot.  Excellent value.  Fantastic and friendly service.  We'll be back many times again."}
{"text":"I did not like this place at all. I came Becky of the reviews I read, but was definitely disappointed. I asked for scrambled eggs with cheese and got hard stiff eggs with 2 slices of UNMELTED cheese over the eggs. Really?! The cheese never melted, even after mixing them in my eggs. Corn hash was cooked extremely too hard and the French toast was blah. I could've made a better breakfast at home. I won't be back. Not upset, just down right disappointed."}
{"text":"For breakfast or lunch, one can never go wrong at this place if you're wanting home cooking. The food is always made fresh and comes hot. Get the sweet tea; You get an entire pitcher of tea just for the table, and the taste has you envisioning of sitting on The roast beef sub is savory. The country breakfast is life here!--the biscuit and gravy satisfy the breakfast craving The front porch during summer days. The waitresses are always hospitable and personable. Between the eccellent customer service and food quality, you get your money worth at this place."}
{"text":"Really awesome Greek food.  Best that my wife and I have had in the Charlotte area.  Wait staff also great and nice atmosphere.  Can't wait to come back and try the Italian food."}
{"text":"Was a little worried by the outside and the interior decorating(outdated)... But our waitress was very nice, the food was good, and it was cheap! Two of us had huge breakfasts for $12. A good breakfast spot when you don't want to wait in line for a table on a weekend or overpay."}
{"text":"I stopped in here one morning on the way back from dropping the kids at school, and while it isn't much to look at (on the outside or the inside), I'm glad that I did.  The service is top-notch.  Everyone greets you with a doll baby or a honey or a sweetie every time they see you - whether it's the first time, whether they are filling your glass or whether you are on your way out the door.  The food is served quickly, as you ordered it (even the eggs were cooked perfectly).  When I say quickly, I mean quickly.  No, it's not as fast as fast food, but it's fast.  I took a newspaper in with me, and I barely had time to turn a couple pages and the plate was coming back to me.  Color me impressed.  As to the food - hey, it's a greasy spoon and it was breakfast.  What do you expect?  But it's good.  The hash browns are the shredded kind, no home fries here, but they have a nice bowl of jelly selection on the table (even strawberry - something many places lack these days), and it came out hot.  What else can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Pasta is a bit overpriced for a small restaurant. Food is ok. Few tips for the servers.  1- Never ask for the food order before we've put in our drink order.  2-Never bring main plates out at different times for guests.  3-Never ask if the customer wants the check b4 they're finished eating.   Thanx"}
{"text":"I love this place!! Whenever I need a home cooked meal this is where I come!! I love their breakfast especially the livermush (liver pudding)!"}
{"text":"Very good Italian and Greek food at reasonable prices. I've never had a bad experience visiting this location of Dino's or the location in Harrisburg, and I'm honestly surprised this spot doesn't get more customers because it always seems empty inside. I've mostly tried their Italian menu items, and I can say that their pastas are generally very good, and their calzones and strombolis are awesome! I've had one gyro from Dino's and it was good, but I have not tried much of the Greek menu aside from that, nor have I tried many of their subs. Based on the quality of the other food I've eaten here, however, my guess is that everything is likely to be above average at least."}
{"text":"Was a little skeptical at first. Small restaurant in a big shopping center very few customers on the mid-week night that I visited...almost decided to pass it by but I am glad I gave them a try. The food was real good, the staff was very pleasant and attentive. Definitely a do it again when i am in the area."}
{"text":"Interesting place. Definitely a down home place. Country as it can get I hope. Lol. I got the hot cakes and sausage links. Fluffy pancakes. Three was enough and I could not eat them three.  The staff is southern friendly.  From the outside one would not stop to come. So I can say this place would remind you not to judge a book by its cover. This place is definitely a good place to eat and at a reasonable price.  The interior is just an dinner setting. Can use a make over but it is warm and friendly. And the place has a very warm and friendly atmosphere. That makes you want to return. A good place to stop in after church or for a week day after work? Really good establishment."}
{"text":"Easy breakfast in a quiet family-style restaurant just off North Tryon, I was at a table and placing my order in seconds. Cheese omelet, hash browns and wheat toast with coffee. My waitress was quick, efficient and got the job done.  Breakfast was exactly as ordered needing only a few blobs of the Texas Pete that was already on the table. Perfect.  $10 with tip, hard to go wrong!"}
{"text":"Great little find! Got a chicken parm sub and the sauce was great. Bread was toasty and it came with fries (or pasta!). Their chicken souvlaki plate was gorgeous and very good too. I will def come back to try more food an maybe their desserts."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant hidden away in a Strip Mall. Was leery at first, but cannot go wrong. Their greek food is amazing. Their subs are good, So is their Italian dishes. The only thing I was not crazy about was the pizza.   Pizza tastes like something from Hungry Howies. Not impressed at all, but if i've tried several things on the menu and the only thing I don't like is the pizza, i'd say that's pretty darn good.   Service is always very friendly, but the thing to remember it is a casual place.   I will continue to go back !"}
{"text":"I pass by this place 4-5 a week on my way to Noda. My boyfriend and I decided we didn't want to wait for a table at Cracker Barrel today and that a \"mom and pop\" restaurant is what we needed.  Don't let the outside fool you, not only is Dino's WAY bigger on the inside but it also has a great \"homey\" feel. If you love country style breakfast at great prices, this place is for you. The servers are great, crowd is a little older but everyone was in a great mood.  The food was really good. My boyfriend got the two eggs and ribeye steak with grits. I got two eggs and bacon with hash browns. We also shared an order of French toast. My only complaint is that the eggs and grits were not seasoned but with it being an older crowd that seems to frequent Dino's, it wasn't a big deal.  We will DEFINITELY be back soon!"}
