{"text":"Good if you want to save a few bucks from california sandwiches. I come here for the steak sandwich that they have on special for $5.99. The steak doesnt have much flavour itself but I always get the spicy sandwich with mushrooms and jalapenos and it over masks it. The place itself is completely run down, always get the food to go. This place only accepts cash so be prepared or else you'll pay $2 at their atm.  Oter then that, it's good enough"}
{"text":"This is a great place to get an Italian sandwich: meatball, veal or chicken - spicy, saucy, and huge. This place gets bonus points for being there for me in a recent food emergency driving back from York University in heavy traffic."}
{"text":"Don't listen to anyone. I've been coming here my whole life. This place is not only the best San Francesco, it's a North York staple. Its beyond the deliciousness of the food; it's the broken arcade machine; it's the soap operas always on the tv; it's the nudy photos on the wall; the sunshine girl behind the cash and the leftover cocaine under the guy at counter's nose. Oh, and I've only had the veal, but I bet it's all good."}
{"text":"WOW this place is simply amazing. They have great pizza and the best / biggest veal sandwich in Toronto. California Sandwiches has absolutely nothing on San Francesco's Finch location. The place may look like a dive, but it just adds character! Friendly staff is accompanied by amazing food and great prices. Not sure if all locations are this good or have as great prices. I know I will be back often and also I'm going to stock up on their frozen dinners!"}
{"text":"I must say this is the best place to a veal sandwich. Have been going here since we moved to Canada 20 years ago. Price is extremely affordable and great quality. The pizzas are on. Keep but definitely recommend the veal."}
{"text":"As a regular customer for many years.. the quality is very constant. I only go there for their hot veal sandwich. Friends tried their chicken, sausage and steak, but I believe veal is the best choice here.  Remember you are paying $6.5 for a huge sandwich, its not gonna be the best veal sandwich in ur life, but it will fill u up positively, though u have to see thru the decor ......"}
{"text":"Over rated.  Tried at food building at CNE.  Very disappointing.  Had the veal and steak sandwich which was very basic intaste, over priced and extra for cost for topping.  Felt like a total gauge/rip off."}
{"text":"So you're not here for the decor.  You're here for the sandwiches.     *Veal hot *Chicken hot   Hot is quite hot but manageable.  Some places, the *hot* is too hot and you can't even taste the rest of the sandwich.  And then in an hour or two you're gonna be paying for it (y'know what I mean?).  For the chicken, the sauce was really nice, tomatoe-y but not too heavy.  The bread sops it up nicely, and you get those really great soft bits.  The piece of chicken was thinly breaded, more meat to breading and the piece of meat was huge.  After I ate the sandwich I didn't need a nap, which I find with these types of sandwiches I always end up in a meat coma.    The veal sandwich was really tender, like fall apart tender, and hubby says \"I didn't feel like crap afterwards.\"    If we're in the area we will be back!"}
{"text":"This place has been here for as long I remember. The decor hasn't changed much at all since I visited years ago, newest addition from what I see is the flat screen TV.  One of the only places that still has an arcade games and sit down arcade table. Yeah for nostalgia!  The prices have risen but the signs have stayed the same. They have updated with strike outs and copy and paste jobbies. lol :)  This used to be a spot where one can get a decent sandwich for cheap in the area, now it's about 8 dollars. I came in the other day to try the meatball sandwich -- be warned it's bloody awful.. slop job see pic, it's full of filler, salty and tasted like a frozen meatloaf.  The frozen foods are still reasonable in cost though but that's a gamble."}
{"text":"Seems like a hole in the wall and kinda dumpy, but the service is great and the pizza is amazing.  Best part is the price is very reasonable and the portion size is great.  Cash only though, visit your bank or use their premium ATM on-site."}
{"text":"Authentic Italian sandwich shop with simple, effective decor. On a mission to find the best meatball and veal parms in the area we landed on this place after a failed attempt at a rival sandwich shop that was a little to \"clean\" for out tastes. Great success. The owner, lively and tank topped took great care of us and even gave us a free meatball sandwich after mistakingly giving us an extra veal (not the worst mistake one could endure). Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"It's an odd little place with pictures of women in bikinis plastered all over the wall.  You would think that your walking into a teenagers room. It's an older looking building. I ordered a party size pepperoni pizza for about $10. It was fine but you get what you pay for in this situation. The staff is ok and were polite to me. I might be back to try their veal sandwich."}
{"text":"Simply the best Veal parmigian sandwich.  Ask for hot peppers on it!!!  They make a great meatball sandwich as well.  The place is pretty much a dump or whole in the wall...but isn't that what you want in a \"dive\" ... those are the best places for good food!  I feel sorry for the people that go to Subway or Wendy's in the same plaza, they have no idea what they're missing out on.  i say keep it dank, keep it old looking, but keep it comin'...... never had a better veal parmigian sandwich anywhere!"}
{"text":"20 years at this location, and it looks it! But they still make great deal sandwiches, especially if you like it \"hot\" with their roasted jalapeno peppers and mozzarella cheese.  The place looks like a dump, the staff looks like they are freshly paroled from prison, and the sausage sandwich was completely unimpressive, but that's no matter, because the hot veal sandwich with cheese is still excellent, and well worth the trip."}
{"text":"Large portions and cheap? Yes and Yes. Good? No!  I don't have veal sandwiches often but when I do it has to be from a good place. So with a 4 star review and cheaply decorated place such as this you would think it's authentic and pretty good. Most holes in the wall are. Well except this one!  The portions are large but it had no taste, Not enough sauce to make it edible. I kept on eating it and wondering why I did, I guess I was I figure if I keep giving it more bites then maybe it would taste good. It wasn't bad, just had no taste.   If you ever try eating just the Big Mac patty it taste like nothing, like eating cardboard. It's kind of like that.  Food 1.0/5 Service 2.0/5 Ambiance 1.0/5 Value 4.0/5  =========  Overall 1.30/5"}
{"text":"Way better veal at California sandwiches. The veal was lacking flavour and not very good."}
{"text":"Solid veal sandwich for $6! It is big, and they do not skim on the ingredients. Each additional topping is $1 extra. I recommend getting the veal with cheese and mushrooms. The decor can be put off some people, but this hole in the wall's veal sandwich is definitely a great bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"Ordered through SkipTheDishes so I can't speak to the service, but the food was a solid 3/5. I ordered the eggplant sandwich with extra cheese and mushrooms and it was an absolute mountain of breaded eggplant - not crispy because of the mess of hearty tomato sauce and generous portion of mozzarella cheese, but very tasty and filling. The eggplant was kinda fibrous so I might go for a meat sandwich next time, but everything else was on point.  I also ordered a frozen veal and a frozen spaghetti with meat sauce, mainly because it pushed me over the threshold for free delivery. I love that they sell frozen meals, and it's an even better deal. Prices are very reasonable to begin with, so getting more meals out of my order was a no-brainer. I haven't tried the veal but the spaghetti was fine - noodles okay, decent portion of meat, needs to be served hot and properly reheated in an oven. I kinda wish they'd just included a slip of paper with the ideal reheating temperature, but that's a quibble.  Would order again if I needed an Italian sandwich fix."}
{"text":"This is the best veal sandwich in all of the gta. I've eaten all of them. This location is better than the downtown locations and anything in Woodbridge. It's looked the same for decades and has been top notch the entire time.   People dig the pizza but I only go for the veal. It doesn't get better! I visit every time I'm uptown."}
{"text":"What a tremendous find.  Needed a quick place to grab an entire hockey team dinner and a short turnaround between games. Over 30 people in this tiny place that's not fancy & took orders quickly got everything correct and what a cheap price. They have soda water and beer. Not much on the looks but a great owner/manager etc. and by the way the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went there today 2 p.m. or so.  The place was empty, we heard a voice saying something.  We waited and then another employee came in from the back room or washroom?   Not sure.  Anyways, he asked the cook if he knew that we were here, so then he asks us what we want. We gave the order and proceeded to wait at a table.  During the wait, other people came in.  There was one, that sat near our table, watching CP24 news, checking his lottery tickets.  While I went to pick up the meal, he was rolling a joint according to my husband. When I went to pay, the bill was $13.54.   I gave him a twenty and my change that was given, was 45 cents and five dollar bill.  I told him that he was a dollar short.  \"Oh yea\" was his reply.  However the food was great!!"}
{"text":"Not great.  Sandwiches are mediocre and pizza is sub par.  With plenty of other Italian fast food places in the area, this is one place I will not be returning."}
{"text":"They have decent veal sandwiches. The quality of the veal meat and toppings is low to medium compared to somewhere like California Sandwiches but for the much cheaper price, it's well worth it."}
{"text":"authentic ital' in industrial north york pizza, sandwiches  low expectations must be kept for their decor not a pretty place  tried their veal sandwich lacking taste, but meat mountain makes the money's worth  i'd like to come back to try their other items maybe a slice next"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time for lunch today and have to say the chicken parmesan and steak sandwiches we ordered were pretty good. Was kind of confused at first because the sign said Don Franchesko rather than San Fransesco, although it is the same place.  Both sandwiches were 4.99 each and with extra toppings and a drink came up to $14.  The sandwiches were enormous, stuffed with lots of meat, big pieces of onions and hot peppers (they are super hot with the seeds in)  It was an impossible sandwich to finish, so you can definitely get two meals out of one if your not a big eater.  Im literally in a food coma while writing this off just half.  Make sure you ask them to cut the sandwich in half because its impossible to handle and the bread tends to break up.  I"}
{"text":"I'm writing this review as I'm eating a veal sandwich right now. They offered hot peppers and I took them- they have quite the zing so prepare yourself! This is a great sandwich for $6.99, you could add extra toppings but I chose not to this time to taste the veal. The meat is thin and tender, not too much sauce and flavour was good and not too salty!   The sandwich is massive and you can cut it in half and eat it later. They have an eggplant sandwich for $3.99 which I am looking forward to trying!  Decor not the greatest and they have those vintage arcade games which I don't think even work anymore but get takeout if you don't appreciate the ambiance."}
{"text":"Their Pizza and Sandwiches are the only thing I have tried and they are DELICIOUS. So many super thin pieces of tender veal in the sand which really worth the price. It has the perfect amount of sauce and meat, super filling! The pizza is a really big slice too so also worth the price."}
