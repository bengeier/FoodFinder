{"text":"Pros- Customer service very good happy people

Cons- crispy pata not crispy, maybe u have to ask them to cook it again and make it crispy before they serve it to you

Needs a lot of improvement in crispy pata
I hope they can make it better"}
{"text":"food is better than the grill city specially the crispy smelt and bagnet. Servers is not smiling and need more training  but thanks to the man whos cooking he saw me waiting in line he approached and greeted me very well told everything about what they sell. still craving lumpiang veggie."}
{"text":"This place was okay. I love crispy stuff but the food temperature was not to my satisfaction. Food was just warm not hot. Lady cashier could have been friendlier."}
{"text":"The Crispy Pata was stale, too old and probably reheated several times. A waste of money. Most of their food looks reheated. Don't eat or buy here."}
{"text":"Crispy Town is in Seafood City Supermarket and they mostly serve fried meats. A lot of what they make are fried chicken and fried pork. But did you know they also offer soup and porridge too. The moment I saw Champorado ($3.99) and Chicken Arroz Caldo ($3.99), I just had to have it. With the cold weather still lingering in Las Vegas, I have been wanting some hot soup. The Chicken Arroz Caldo is a savory rice porridge flavored with chicken and saffron, and it taste so good! The Champorado is a Filipino sweet rice chocolate porridge and it's not as sweet as I anticipated. I think Crispy Town is okay if you enjoy eating lots of fried food. Personally, I prefer having the soup and porridge."}
{"text":"I was totally shocked when I walked inside Seafood City to see two new fast food places of cholesterol goodness side by side - Crispy Town and Grill City!

Crispy Town has one of the better tasting and better portioned fried Filipino dishes in Vegas that I've had. Their crispy a la carte items are sold by weight and priced decently. The bengat (lechon) is not dried out or overcooked and the chicken skin crispiness is what I really liked. It's even better when paired with garlic fried rice! Haha! It wasn't too salty and the vinegar dipping sauce it comes with has a unique flavor and made for a great combination. 

You take a number to place your order. I'm very happy this place opened. I was deprived for a while because Filipino style crispy chicken skin is hard to find in Vegas. This will be my monthly ritual besides Popeye's. LOL!"}
{"text":"I can only speak for the chicken skin here but it is amazing! Think pork rinds with a lighter flavor. I haven't had anything else, but the chicken skin is consistent every time I come here and so addicting!"}
{"text":"Very slow service...Cashier are not friendly ...they should have a wet sponge   beside the cashier ..so that they wont  wet their finger to open the plastic bag..they shld write at the boxes what are the customers ordered rather than cashier will asked what did you got.."}
{"text":"Hmmm...the overall rating for Crispy Town is only 2.5?  Good thing I didn't let that deter me.  I had a great experience.  

Hubs & I drive all the way from the West side in search of fried pork skin & fried chicken skin to go with our weekly dose of papaya salad.  Crispy Town had both...yay!

The friendly counter lady allowed us to sample everything in the warming trays.  Everything was indeed crispy...but a bit salty for me.  Hubs loved it all though.  So we bought a little bit of everything & A LOT of the fried chicken skin.  That was the clear winner :) 

Even after a week, the chicken skin remained crispy.  To freshen it up a bit, we'd throw a batch into the toaster oven for about 5 minutes on \"light toast\" right before service...yum! 

Glad I gave this place a try.  Will definitely go back for all things crispy."}
{"text":"The server in the picture in my check in is great, respectful and he knows how to do his job very well. But the slim lady cashier, you know who you are. If a paying customer like me is asking you some questions politely and I'm saying thank you after a transaction it would be nice to say thank you back or at least acknowledge my attempt to communicate with you. If you are not happy with your job, find another employment please and give it to someone who need it. The food is good, like I said, crispy goodness! But the cashier customer service and attitude  needs improvement, that is why I gave this food establishment 3 stars."}
{"text":"Crispy Town is located inside Seafood City, the filipino grocery store.  They serve crispy Filipino delights such as  bagnet, crispy Pata, fried chicken, smelt, fried calamari and different types of chicharon.  Everything that is fried is fried evenly and  the food is a bit salty. It's a fried salty and crunchy lovers paradise.

Aside from fried salty crunchy food, they also serve different types of stews.

What really sucks though is the service.  At the start of the line is the fried items by the pound. You have to wait soooo long while the server guesses the weight. It's a whole mess if the machine doesn't print the receipt.  The rest of the servers are doing nothing while the guy is weighing the fried stuff. They should probably have the fried stuff at the end so that people who want to try the stews can go ahead and order and be on their way.

Also the place is a stark contrast of grill city where there are some friendly people saying welcome. Here, everyone is frowning and miserable. Very inhospitable.  It is very inefficient too."}
{"text":"Sigh. Well. I give it one star for the options it claimed to offer. I was at the restaurant about 4pm, right before dinner rush, there were only 3 entrees available to order. I asked the lady \"when should i come back once you have the entrees ready?\"... She says \"i dont know?\" and just stared at me. Smh. Well. Thats that. Lol"}
{"text":"Food is good!
They give big portions. Usually a lot of filipino food places they only give you small portion and charge you really expensive. 

Customer service is awesome!!!! Really friendly too!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the places where you should only go once in a blue moon...

Why? 

Cause almost everything tasty here is fried! You seriously need some strong willpower here!!!
Wanted to compare Crispy Town's Crispy Chicken Skin with another nearby spot, so we took the chance and were not disappointed! That vinegar dipping sauce is money!!!

I think I like these over pork chicharrones, but that's personal preference. To make things worse, another temptation is just a couple of doors down...yup, Magnolia Ice Cream. It's a good thing we don't live close by!  ALOHA!!!

{"text":"Better experience last time compared from today's visit. Everything is fresh when you dine early right when they just opened but not so fresh towards lunch time . They don't have a way to keep things warm, what we got was room temperature calamari, room temperature pork which is not crispy at all and okay chicharon bulaklak.  2 stars but there's room for improvement."}
{"text":"Crispy Town is located inside Seafood city market on Maryland of Las Vegas. I have anticipated for grill city to open up recently. Crispy Town opened right at the same time as grill city located right next to each other inside Seafood city market. 

It is set up as a food court, fast food ready to serve. Ordered their half calamari, lumpia and veggie lumpia. Everything was delicious. However almost everything is deep fried here except they do have entrees like pancit and meat choices. 

Friendly service."}
{"text":"Look, I pigged out this day!  1st was Grill City...but wait, Crispy Town literally steps away?  Yes, oily goodness I am coming!

Crispy Town is like the naughty sibling to Grill City next door...instead of grilling everything, why don't we FRY everything instead?  This my friends is what Crispy Town is!  Everything and a vat of oil!

To accompany our order from Grill City, we (well I) decided to give Crispy Town a go and get a 'Value Meal' from them as well.  We got:

*#1 - Bagnet with eggplant salad ($6.99)

Bagnet is basically fried pork belly.  Yes, fried tasty pieces of essentially what is known as uncured bacon!!  It is delicious as it sounds, particularly with a large serving of steamed white rice and a side of suko (vinegar) & soy sauce or All-Purpose sauce!  For just over $7 after tax I could see myself eating this at LEAST once a week!  Oh that fatty, fried pork belly with a scoop of rice, with some eggplant salad to cut the richness?  AI SOS!  Cut to napping.

For those of you new to eggplant salad, for us Filipinos it's a salad with roasted eggplant mixed with diced red onions & bell peppers.  Doused with some soy sauce it's a great accompaniment with fried foods.

Besides the the value meal, we also got an order of Fried Calamari to share...because, why not?  This was yummy too!  Fried fresh, light & airy, and went awesome with the rest of our meal.

Only complaint here is that AGAIN, the line can be horrendous & you are also sharing your table space with patrons from Grill City!  Seating is all in the same area.  It can (and will) get busy especially on the weekends.

If it's done RIGHT, how can you go WRONG with fried foods from Crispy Town!

{"text":"Don't go here!!! Male server is so disrespectful!! Walang manners! 7/23/2018 8PM Grill city nalang pumunta kesa makipag deal ka sa bastos na server"}
{"text":"Came here with my sister it was her first time. It was my third time iv always liked this place. It does good for my Filipino fried food craving."}
{"text":"It's not a particularly strong competition to Grill City which is steps nearby.  However, we chose this place seeing as there were only a couple of customers and we figured the line at Grill City was a bit too long for us.  I don't have to say that it's pretty common for customers to pause and take a few seconds to decide on their order.  There were four of us in our group, two of which could not decide on what to order.  Right away, I sensed that the lady behind the counter was clearly annoyed and tried to hurry them into ordering, even cutting us off mid-order so that she can expedite the process, and even elevating the tone in her voice.  I tried clarifying the confusion between the two in our group so that we could order as I now felt the need to rush them because of the Crispy Pata lady's demeanor; mind you, NO ONE was behind us in line, otherwise I would have understood the reason for hurrying us.  I then sternly asked, borderline order her to give us just a few seconds seeing as there was no one waiting in line behind us.  She grumbled and stepped back all the while banging serving spoons around as if it wasn't at all apparent to us that she was upset.  It is unacceptable, as a customer, to have been treated so poorly for no good reason.  If she cannot produce a better attitude to be able to work professionally with customers, then she should not be working in this type of industry where she has to constantly interact with customers.  Now I can't speak for the entire crew's regard for customer service as I had only dealt with the one lady.  I can only hope the others have better treatment of customers as our patronage is the reason they have a job.  The food here is not great, but it's satisfactory and definitely has room to improve.  The only other thing that would help it is exceptional customer service, which unfortunately, was severely lacking during our visit, so needless to say, customer service has to improve by A LOT.

3 stars for food, but extremely poor customer service lowered the overall rating to 1 star because one's overall experience combines both the food and customer service."}
{"text":"If you're not looking while they're putting your food in the box, they will give you less portion, which happened to me (mandurugas). I told the woman what I wanted and went straight to the cash register. When I got home and to my surprise, I was only given 3 small pieces of lechon kawali."}
{"text":"SUPER SLOW SERVICE!!!
RUDE CASHIER!!

I hope the staff are reading this because I'm about to give you some FREE helpful tips to avoid situations like this in the future. I'm doing you a favor despite the horrible service I received, tonight.

So, I got a coupon for a $2 taho promo for shopping at the grocery. I went in line to avail it. It was a looong wait because the customers before me took forever to order and most of the staff were not paying attention. 

Tip 1: Customers first!!
They were doing other things instead of minding CUSTOMERS!! Your business comes from customer transactions. Help them first before you do other stuff!

Anyway, a nice guy noticed me waiting and prepared my order. Then I waited some more at the register to get charged for it. After what seemed like forever, the guy reminded one of the ladies that I've been waiting. The lady finally charged me for it then checked my coupon and my receipt. Only AFTER the charge had gone through did she had the audacity to tell me that I don't actually qualify for the promotion because apparently I needed to have spent at least $25 at the grocery to avail it.

Tip 2: Check for requirements before processing any transactions!!
Are you serious?? You could've told me in the first place that I did not qualify so I didn't have to wait for so long!!! Also, the way she told me that was plain rude! She sounded annoyed like I did it on purpose or like I was some kind of cheater trying to scam them (of taho?? Seriously?? Ganun ba kasarap taho niyo?) 

Tip 3: Think before you speak.
Lady, you work in customer service. There are better ways to tell a customer they don't qualify without being rude! Specially if it's not the customers fault! No where on the receipt NOR the coupon does it say the that purchase had to be at least $25!!!

All this rudeness for a $2 dessert??

Tip 4: Communication goes a long way!
Since it's not on any of the receipts/coupons, please communicate this restriction to the grocery cashiers so they don't give \"unqualified\" customers your coupons. It will save, not just the customers, but also YOUR TEAM a lot of time and effort. Maybe, it will also save them from rude encounters like the one I experienced tonight.

Crispy Town staff, please take note."}
{"text":"First timer since this place opened.  

I was just passing through to see what was on the menu & what first caught my eye was the fried chicken skin.  

So what did I do, ordered a half pound of it.  All for under $5. Mm mm mmmm.  Okay, that was going on in my head, when I finally tasted it, it wasn't as I imagined it.  

It tasted more on the chicharon side then deep fried chicken skin peeled off the chicken.  I think it missed the natural flavor of the chicken and it was a bit on the saltier than expected.  

However, I still enjoyed it and dipping it in the vinegar sauce makes a lot better.  Definitely something to eat while you are enjoying a beer and watching your favorite sport.

Just as an FYI they did have some others things that were not fried.  Their pinakbet looked better than the pinakbet that was served at Grill city..that one was cooked in coconut milk...not my Filipino style.

Hey y'all, worth a shot trying this place out."}
{"text":"My wife and I were food shopping at SeaFood City and we decided to get a quick snack on the way out. We ordered the Shanghai lumpia's, paid for it and went on our merry way. We started to eat these things on the drive home and realized it was cold, soggy and tasteless! Come on now!? How can you screw a simple dish like this? It was so bad we couldn't eat it and ended up throwing it in the garbage. If this is a sample of the food they serve there! We'll never eat there, EVER!  My advice, avoid this place and eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"The girl who helped us well to me was rude I don't know her name not care she didn't smile, she has an attitude I mean at least transactions done she said thank you."}
{"text":"I usually come here after the gym because it's on the way...I know I basically negated everything I did in the gym and more by eating here. But my craving for lechhon is real!  I usually get the two item combo. I always get the Lechon but they also have crispy pata ( pig feet) crispy fish, calamari etc.  for the other item I usually get a curry or a stew, but again with fatty pork.

This for sure is not the best Filipino food. The lechon is not the crispiest and the food is very fatty and oily. But it works for me and I've been back several times."}
{"text":"Please display your Grade from the Health Department. Keep the food fresh and warm. Ask your staff to smile more it doesnt hurt. Be polite. Filipinos are known to be polite. Again keep food hot/warm around 160° keep it fresh and train staff better. Please last thing that people can get is a frowny face and a cold food from you guys."}
{"text":"Cheap and greasy fried Filipino foods. We got the fried anchovies and chicken skins. Both were crunchy and tasty. We also got various seafood balls from Seafoods City. Nothing more need to be said, just go get some."}
{"text":"Located inside the Filipino-oriented Seafood City grocery/fast food complex, Crispy Town, as the name suggests, serves up all your glorious fried food needs. This review is specifically about the chicken chicharron which is fried chicken skin and a delicious Filipino delicacy. Although chicharron, usually of the pork variety, can be bought at most Asian groceries in the GTA, the Crispy Town version is freshly made in-house. It's super salty, super crispy, super delicious...and yes, really bad for you, but heyyy....this really shouldn't be eaten on its own and is probably best served with non-fried and healthy dishes. Otherwise, your poor throat and stomach will just get overwhelmed. By the way, this is sold by the weight but is luckily on the lighter side. They usually put them in foil bags so if you ask for \"half a bag\", it comes out to around $5. Pro-tip: dip it in liver sauce or the sweet chili sauce to avoid the monotonous fried taste.

{"text":"Damn I don't know why this place has a low rating for ? I mean what do you expect for a Filipino place to give perfect customer service. The best one you'll prolly get for good service is maybe Max's chicken. Anyways went there on a hour before closing and the lady hooked me up. She charge me for a small for a large calamari and chicharron. This place is decent but not to  bad. I'll come back here again to get some more of in around the area."}
{"text":"Crispy Town is a quick service restaurant within the newly opened Seafood City. They serve a a variety  of fried items  such as calamari, shrimp, fish, chicken skins, bagnet, pata . They have a couple of desserts  such as turon, halo halo which are my favourites  
 I got the Crispy Chicken Skins, two footlong turons and a halo halo . 
The crispy skins were quite good. They were crispy  but not rock hard and there was a bit of a softness which I liked. 
As of today , Crispy Town is my  go to for  halo halo and turon. All these years I was only able to get it once a year from  the Phillipine Deli  at the CNE. I will still go there at CNE but for the rest of the year  Crispy Town is where I will get my fix
The turons are a must order I am telling u right now that  you need to order a footlong turon .   To keep things short and sweet i describe turon as a banana spring roll  filled with jackfruit and banana that is crispy on the outside and soft on the  inside. I was going to get one but could not resist getting one more . 
The halo halo  is another favourite of mine. I shall also keep this short and sweet and describe it as a  matrimony between shaved ice,  milk, beans, tapioca,ube,  jelly and  fruits . The way I prefer to eat it is to slowly pick items from the top and have it with the ice and slowly work my way down. I have  been told to mix it all up but i dont like doing that so i guess do whatever works for u and makes u feel happy 
Service was excellent considering its their opening weekend . It was quick, and  pleasant. They also have debit and credit which is a big  plus . 
They also have some combos on the menu which i will post in pictures. The portions that I saw customers being served  are quite generous and if i order am most likely splitting it up into two meals . 
I do wish that there were some explanations for what each item on the menu is because someone not knowing will not know what to order and keep asking questions thereby slowing down the  line.  I was fine since wikipedia helps  demystify  many things. 
I will be returning   to  try other dishes and to satisfy my fix of turon and halo halo .
Note: Be prepared for long  lineups.  Use the long lineups to  browse the net on your phone ,or glance at the menus on display to add items on your list for future visit  . If you cannot deal with the long lineups then too bad ."}
