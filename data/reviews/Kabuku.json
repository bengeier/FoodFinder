{"text":"Really good rolls!  Bit pricy, but great product. Definitely a must have if you're in the Aspen / West Springs area."}
{"text":"Très gouteux ! Très bon restaurant avec un personnel super chaleureux et accueillant. Je le recommande"}
{"text":"Closed on Sundays. I don't work downtown. I was hoping to try this place on a Sunday afternoon. Guess it won't be happening."}
{"text":"Went there today with my bosses to say farewell - to me - because I'm moving to BC! Yay!  It's pretty easy to get a res. Try to book a few days early if you can. You can book online, which is super easy and efficient.   The place is usually pretty busy at lunch time and not too busy for dinner.   I love the sushi here. It's so fresh and tasty. They always are featuring a special which is nice. I love sushi places that mix things up and create new rolls. Today's was like a dynamite roll but it had some tasty spicy sauce on the outside with wasabi powder and crunchy tempura flakes. Yum!  Their sashimi is amazing. They have some really delicious items on their menu that cater to the non-sushi eater in your group (crazy non-sushi lovers!!!)   The service is always really good and very friendly.   I must admit their prices are a bit high for my liking but the quality of the food they serve well makes up for it.   Sushi Lovers Unite!!!"}
{"text":"One of the better and affordable sushi places in the city!  Love the personal chopsticks"}
{"text":"Their Omakase (literally \"entrusting\") Special is one you have to experience. Basically, it's a multi-course meal, driven purely by the chef's imagination. It gives the chefs an excuse to \"play\" and get really creative with what *they* feel like presenting; it gives you, the diner, a chance to experiment. My husband and I are seasoned sushi aficionados and have tried things during both times we've done the Omakase which we probably ordinarily wouldn't have tried. Tetsuji, the executive chef, is so full of pride and a genuine love for the food. Incredible, fresh, and memorable. Forget watching the same, tired California rolls floating past on sushi boats; Kabuku has everyone else beat."}
{"text":"I tried this Japanese restaurant recently and I must say this is one of the best Japanese restaurants that I have dined in Canada.   I tried their Tempura  - Avocado (4 pieces) and Scallops (4 pieces). So I had eight tempura in total by myself which could be bit greasy in most cases. However, their tempura were lightly battered and very well prepared that I did not feel them greasy at all. As a result, I was able to enjoy all eight pieces without any problem.  Then I tried their Sushi - I tried various Nigiri Suhi (Hamachi, smoked salmon, Squid, Ikura, octopus, etc). To my surprise, every single one of them was very fresh. Honestly, I didn't expect to find such fresh sushi in Canada. The portion/size for each sushi was adequate too. I was full after finishing my meal.   The only thing I didn't like was that their IKA (squid) had Perilla and plum sauce on it, but I guess that is just my personal taste.   This place is bit pricey. I paid $60 after tax and tip for 8 pieces of tempura and 10 pieces of Nigiri Sushi. I didn't have any tuna by the way. It would have cost more if I had. However, I recommend this place despite the price as their food quality is very good. Again, I was really surprised to find such fresh sushi in Canada."}
{"text":"This was the best Sushi I've had in a very, very long time.  The rolls are very flavorful, and complex. A delight, and so delicate we almost stopped using soya and wasabi. It seemed like an insult to the excellent flavors.  The sushi was obviously detailed, served very fresh, and at the perfect temperature and with excellent sauces.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time a few weeks ago. There were three of us for dinner. The service wasn't very good, though I can't blame the waitress because she was definitely working hard to accommodate everyone on a very busy night.   We ordered a variety of items off the menu including sushi, rolls, and tempura. The food was presented beautifully but everything had way too much sauce on top. I wasn't a fan."}
{"text":"Nice decor, bright, decent service but mediocre food since it moved from penny lane."}
{"text":"Not a good experience. The place is dead, just like their customer service skills. Ordered assorted sashimi, nabeyaki udon, rainbow stampede roll, and a spicy typhoon roll. Server brought us soup and salad to start, saying that it goes with the sashimi. Then someone else brings out a sushi/sashimi combo. We didn't order that so we sent it back. All of our food came out, and then the server comes back and says, \"You didn't want the sushi/sashimi combo?\". When we said no, he went on to tell us that the soup and salad (which were half eaten already) was for the combo. Since we didn't order the combo, he asked if he could charge us for the soup and salad! We had no idea which menu items come with soup and salad... But he made us feel as if we purposely conned them into giving us free soup and salad. He then took the half eaten soup and salad away. Anyway, aside from that, the sashimi is extremely thin and not sliced well. Nabeyaki udon wasn't very flavourful and the egg was still raw. The whites were still clear for the most part. Rainbow roll was ice cold. Spicy typhoon roll was actually ok. Nevertheless, will not be returning."}
{"text":"So this is probably the best sushi I've had in Calgary.  The two strikes against it would be the price and the fact that sushi in Calgary in general is a set at a low bar.  I would be back but last time I was here, service was annoyingly slow."}
{"text":"You know you're hooked on Yelp when you make a date with a friend just to earn a  badge. But that's exactly what I did with a fellow Yelper as we set out on a quest to earn the Sushi Sensei badge!   Not only did we want to earn the badge, but we also wanted to be able to compare the restaurants like for like. We decided that an order of California rolls would be our staple in every restaurant and we would supplement that with an order of the restaurant's feature rolls. Now, you're probably thinking \"that's a LOT of mayonnaise and fake crab\". Well reader, read on, because although we risked OD-ing on mayonnaise and getting mercury poisoning, we came out with some great tips for anyone seeking sushi in Calgary's downtown area!  Sushi Stop #4: ZEN Japanese Restaurant ZEN was a solid sushi stop. By the time we reached ZEN, our stomachs were bursting with rice, and mayonnaise poisoning seemed inevitable. But we pushed on and ordered one last order of California rolls. While they didn't blow my mind, they were solid California rolls.   ZEN had solid sushi and good tea. The atmosphere was good. Not overly fancy, not overly basic or shabby.   We were able to walk right into a table, which is a nice change from the busy lunch time crowds they usually get.   Would I go back? Yeah, for sure. But I think I need a little sushi break first!  Sushi Stop #1 was Sakana Grill - read my review here: http://www.yelp.ca/biz/sakana-grill-calgary#hrid:LJusrjLfGGSYo3xN-sN0XQ  Sushi Stop #2 was Sushi Tokyo - read my review here: http://www.yelp.ca/biz/sushi-tokyo-calgary#hrid:HnewuxN6A-0UCAVO_vvBRA  Sushi Stop #3 was Ki Modern Japanese - read my review here: http://www.yelp.ca/biz/ki-modern-japanese-bar-calgary#hrid:OXBHmi6H3kQ8QFEvvlfALQ   -- L"}
{"text":"Meh it was okay. Had the Omasaka (sp?) menu but my dining guest had some food allergies. They did an okay job, but it just wasn't the unique experience that an Omasaka menu is supposed to be. Felt like we were just getting the regular sushi."}
{"text":"i also went here for a business lunch and, wow. it was good. our host spoke japanese, so when the chef came out to ask how things were, he got really happy and bough all six of us sake bombs.   the waitress was a bit of an annoying ditz who did lots of the ny times ``100 things a waiter should never do``, such as obsessing over clearing off our table.   we just ordered a bunch of rolls,tempura`d vegetables, and some western vinaigrette take on shrimp. unbelievable. great meal and i will come back. we also had some octopus sashimi which was the best i`ve ever had since japan.  i cannot comment about the price or the value, however."}
{"text":"ZEN's mission statement is \"To maintain respect while consistently providing top quality food and service\" - and I'd have to say they definitely honor this.  I've frequented this sushi place over the years and have always had a great experience - awesome fresh food, great atmosphere and service. My favorite appetizer is tied between the spicy scallops and prawns and the agedashi tofu. Their salmon sashimi is marbled perfectly and the volcano sauce used for the spicy tuna rolls is amazing!  With quality does come price - it is a bit expensive here, a lunch can run from $30-$40 easily. But I think it's nice to treat yourself every once in a while - especially when it comes to delicious food :)"}
{"text":"I felt in the mood for sushi and this place was on my way home. I am happy that I stopped by. The kamikaze rolls were excellent and the ice cream dessert was yummy. I have been to upscale Japanese restaurants in Calgary (Towa) and prefer Zen for the price."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Zen. They have good service, great sushi and holy crap the salad dressing!   You know that Japanese salad dressing that comes on pretty much all the salads in pretty much all the sushi places in town? You know how it's really good? Zen seriously has taken this dressing and done some sort of magic to it making it heavenly. I never thought I would be so impressed with leaves and sauce, but Zen has made me a believer.   They are also exceptionally good at sushi. The fish is always fresh and succulent and the rolls vary from the normal California/spicy tuna/vegetable into Alberta rolls with smoked salmon, a yam tempura roll that is anything but ordinary and spider rolls that make you want to overeat.   Zen is a great place to grab a sushi boat before you head out (or after you are done) shopping in the core or to catch a bite and some sake after work; and because everything is so fresh and delicious, you won't feel bad stuffing yourself silly, leaning back in your chair and ordering just one more salad and spider roll.  T."}
{"text":"We are giving it a 4 star, but my daughter feels it's a 4.5 star, piece wise a little expensive, but with it for my beautiful child.  And we came away very full."}
{"text":"This is a fabulous sushi place in downtown Calgary. I placed a to-go order here when I was working late at the University of Alberta Calgary Centre a block away, and was super impressed with my experience. Even though it was dinnertime (6pm) on a weekday, my food was ready in 10 minutes. When I got to the restaurant, the staff helped me immediately. It looked so nice inside  I wished I could stay to dine in! My seafood sashimi dinner was amazing and reasonably priced. I know if I lived in Calgary I'd be stopping by Zen on a regular basis. Can't wait until my next visit!"}
{"text":"First off the restaurant itself is clean, friendly staff. The food is good The prices are high !!!!! $26.95 for chicken teriyaki.   You get chunks of chicken in a small bowl with teriyaki sauce, some vegetables, and a bowl of rice and miso soup. Other restaurants charge 1/2 that. If your somewhat cheap, and like to take the family out to dinner this may not be the place for you. If you don't mind spending more on dinner, then this place might be okay. I just have to look at this from a family man's perspective. I have to get value for my hard earned dollar."}
{"text":"Delicious!  We were told about Kabuku from my boss!  Such a happy find!  I'm somewhat a sushi snob and it was wonderful!"}
{"text":"Location: right downtown, extremely busy during lunch rush during business days. Make reservation in advance or show up early. Will sell out.   Food is above average priced and not sure if it is worth it. Sashimi was excellent both red tuna and wild sockeye. Had a kamikaze roll as well and I felt it was lacking some flavour. Everything had a nice fresh, clean taste but the roll just didn't have what I was looking for.   Overall a good spot for a business lunch but probably better options to get some bang for your buck outside of the downtown core."}
{"text":"I am a stickler for sushi excellence which is difficult to find in land-locked Alberta.  Discovered KABUKU while enroute to the BANFF MOUNTAIN Film & Book Festival in 2014.  Located in the heart of Calgary, their service was spot-on and the food -- well.. it was fantastic!  Especially enjoyed the Aburi Sake Toro and Chinook Maki.  We will be back fo sho!"}
{"text":"This restaurant fails at a very basic level. The booths are structured to obstruct all view of the sushi bar and the place feels claustrophobic even with full floor to ceiling glass walls. The sushi is mediocre at best. Be forewarned, they use a \"Brown rice blend\" in their sushi that is entirely inappropriate for sushi and is undercooked and much too toothy as well. They should be using a high quality light brown short grain rice and steaming it well to make it supple if they insist on using brown rice at all. The mouthfeel of their rice is sandy and not pleasant and since sushi is really all about the rice, this sushi is unsatisfying and is not constructed well as the brown rice gets in the way of a proper pressing of rice to the fish so the fish feel perched on the rice and falls off each piece. The fish was mostly fresh but sub-optimal in terms of quality. I was hungry so I ate my fill but would not return. Look elsewhere."}
{"text":"I ate at Kabuku with my Manager and this was our third occurrence in the past two months and our last.  Service was poor for the price point, slow drink service and clueless server (McDonald's has better trained staff).  We found plastic in our rolls.  The server barely reacted to the situation like it was normal and we asked for the Manager.  When the Manager came over he said \"oh just a little bit of plastic\" with no apologies.  The item was taken off the bill however however the customer service is atrocious!  Never going back!"}
{"text":"I was taken out to lunch by a group of ladies here. I really enjoyed how it was nice and quiet and classy. The person serving us food was super nice and attentive.great atmosphere, great sushi - it was very fresh. What a lovely recommendation.I would definitely come back for sushi."}
{"text":"All around great experience. Love that they've choose healthy options substitutions - first ever that I didn't have to ask for low sodium soya sauce. Enjoyed the rolls and combinations. Service fantastic. Yum."}
{"text":"Nice place! Service was great, very personable and courteous from start to finish.  The restaurant is clean and fresh.  Ordered the 10 piece nigiri sushi with miso soup w/ hot sake.  Portion was perfect, nigiri and soup was great! From my experience I would recommend a visit."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places in Calgary.  Everything is shockingly fresh, and done just right.  The sashimi is out of the world."}
{"text":"I ate there this week and the spicy tuna roll was one of the best that i have tried. Really good service."}
{"text":"The seating is comfortable. We went on a Friday evening at 5:30pm, and by the time we left at 7:30pm, about 90% of the seating was (and remained) open. Unsure why it was so empty, but not a great sign for business. Price wise, it was pretty expensive for the size of the portions. Sure, that sushi platter has 20 pieces...but really? $70? The food is good, but feels distinctively less Japanese than say, Zipang. There were some hints of fusion, like the kind of mushrooms used for the cod dish, or the mayo in some of the sushi. Variety wise, there wasn't a lot of option. There are tons of fish types, sure, but the variety of dishes isn't a lot. I can imagine this as a good option for groups or families. Overall, we are pleased and understand why this place had good ratings. But, it really is way over priced. We may go back. Unsure at this point."}
{"text":"#177  One of my rare downtown excursions turned out even better. Lunch with a new friend and trying out this restaurant that had been on my bucket list for some time. What a great first encounter.  Around the corner from the Shell Centre and in the building with TD Bank, this little restaurant gets busy very quickly. We were here less than 15 minutes and it was already half full!! You need reservations for a table.  The hosts are not as friendly as one would expect, hence the 1 star deduction though we were seated promptly. The server was pretty friendly and quick to take our order which was the sushi and sashimi (come with mushroom based miso soup and salad), kamikaze roll, and Alaska roll.  All the fish (salmon sashimi, tuna sashimi, eel sashimi, etc.) were very fresh and the eel was uber delicieux! The Alaska roll was your typical California roll topped with smoked salmon (but still good). The kamikaze was very fresh with tuna and flakes on top of a roll. Both rolls were 8 pieces.  The food came out very quickly.  I will admit this place is priced higher than competing sushi restaurants in the area but it is a nice place and definitely for those people on a date or business venture.  Go after 1800 to save on parking (and to also be able to easily find parking) but do yourself a favour, get a reservation! If you are single or think your date might not be that good, get a window seat to people watch."}
{"text":"The food was good, the atmosphere was pleasant and peaceful, the prices were decent, and the service was fantastic! I loved my experience here."}
{"text":"Good choice for Japanese food in downtown Calgary.  This place definitely caters more towards business travelers staying nearby as it is quite empty normally.  Came here multiple times for take out and dine and favorites include the Sushi & Sashimi combo, Saikyo yaki (miso marinated black cod) and Agedashi tofu.  Definitely one of my go to restaurants when staying across the street at the Westin."}
{"text":"On this trip to Zen, I had an assortment of sashimi, spicy soup, and chocolate mousse.  This place is consistently the best suishi place in Calgary.  Its a little pricey by my Toronto standards.  I like the quirky decor - mostly traditional asian with a few standout north american pieces.  The server was great.  She was quite chatty and offered good descriptions of the dessert menu."}
{"text":"Sushi...4 stars.  The sushi here is pretty good.  The top sirloin beef in the Alberta roll is buttery tender.  The rice used in the rolls, however, is not as good as Ki's.  I don't know if it's because of the purple rice they use, but it's just not as tender or pleasing to the mouth as the typical white rice variety.  I've had many varieties of purple rice and they simply firm up faster than white rice when cooled or sitting around until being used...perhaps it's because they have a higher starch density and are best when used immediately.    Tempura...5 stars.  The star of this establishment!  Regardless of which ingredient you chose, they are all perfectly prepared with a light and crunchy batter. Certainly some of the best I've had!  Loved the tempura avocado!!"}
{"text":"Great, friendly service with good suggestions and advice. Some disproportionate menu pricing; for example, high value for dollar items included the volcano salmon and beef tataki, whereas the sashimi was low value for dollar. That said, quality was quite good. I definitely recommend the volcano rolls and volcano salmon stir fry."}
{"text":"This would have been a 5 star, except the price. Wow, is it ever expensive there.   The hubs and I came here as we wanted to check out a new sushi place. And we figured being downtown Saturday afternoon it wouldn't that busy. Which it wasn't.   The sushi was fantastic. Nice thick white lines in the salmon and the miso soup has mushrooms it in. It was sooo good!!!  Great service, not busy, no crazy lines like some places. Parking can be a nightmare due to area, but that is ok."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped here for sushi one night. We'd planned on going to ZEN, but we couldn't find it anywhere and stopped here instead.  Overall, a great experience. The place had underground parking which is reasonably priced and an indoor entrance which was super useful on that snowy night.  We showed up and it wasn't very busy for a Saturday night, but we were seated immediately in a nice quiet booth. We were given a drink and entree menu, and a menu to mark which sushi we wanted.  I ordered an alcoholic beverage called Sakura Blossom - lychee lower and vodka(?) with cranberry and pineapple juice. Mmm, good! I usually find these drinks not sweet enough for my taste, but this one was really well balanced! Next, we ordered mushroom and sweet potato tempura as an appy. I thought it was really good! I usually find tempura too oily, but this one was tasty and not too greasy.  My boyfriend and I ordered 4 sushi rolls - super eruption roll, vegetable roll, Chinook roll and the dynamite body roll. All of them were well prepared and fresh! There was also low sodium soy sauce at all the tables, which was a great healthy option, and plenty of wasabi and pickled ginger came with the sushi.  For dessert, we tried the frozen chocolate mousse. Honestly, not the best option. It came with banana brûlée and matcha powder, and maybe it was because I was so full, but it just didn't blow me away. The portion size, however, was perfect for two people to share.  Overall, I would definitely return if I'm nearby because the service was amazing and the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"I'm always a big fan of solid service. And ZEN service at this moment is solid. The staff is friendly and helpful. Two examples to highlight this:  Example #1, my colleagues and I are frequent travelers and when the host sees us walk in with all our coats and carry-on luggage, they offer to take them aside and hold it for us. That's service.   Example #2, we sit down, the waitress comes over hands us hot towels. She smiles, and we chit chat about the menu. She's happy to be there. We're happy to be there. Life is good.  The food is good, I think you're getting decent value for your buck here. And this place is vastly superior to the unmentionable place down the street from it.   Will go back on a regular basis to fix my fish cravings."}
{"text":"Very good sushi!    I love sushi and don't think I've given five stars to any other place in town.  It's pricey but worth it.  Well worth it!!"}
{"text":"Delicious little sushi bar downtown! I've taken groups and clients before, and we've always had a blast - very social and interactive meal."}
{"text":"Went to this downtown bustling place for lunch today and feel compelled to give a review. Not that the food was bad but I have worked in the service industry and our waitress needed a serious attitude adjustment or a happy pill. She was a pretty Asian girl with style but she should remember that attitude and manners go a long way in earning good money as a server. She was ok as far as service goes but barely smiled, was curt and when I came back after forgetting my doggie bag she did not so much as smile and say have a nice day after she retrieved it from the back. In fact she didn't even so much as give me some eye contact and a nod. I will point out it was busy but not slammed at this time and her pissy attitude was from the moment we arrived at 11:15 am when no one was there. I gave her a 10$ tip on 80$ bill but if she was a little smarter and friendlier she would have gotten much more. The economy is down and based on this experience I'll take my hard earned money to another restaurant next time because many people survive on their tips but it's not my obligation to just give them to someone who doesn't treat me like a guest in their restaurant. I'm sure the owners would not want guests to feel this way."}
{"text":"Maybe I am spoilt by the delicious sushi in Vancouver, but I and husband found the food to be not impressive. The service was friendly and they had empty tables on friday night which was neat for us because it was a few blocs off the Westin.  We had green tea which was good and I had dumplings in soup which were a bit too salty but nice otherwise. But, both the rolls we had, the spicy tuna and imitation crab, and the one with unagi were not very flavourful and the rice was hard and fell apart in a single poke. We also had few pieces of saba, which was okay."}
{"text":"I'm a weirdo who doesn't eat seafood, and yet I still enjoy dining out at sushi restaurants from time to time.   Kabuku has two locations in Calgary: one downtown on 4th Ave and this, their second, in the Aspen Woods neighbourhood. Being a short walk from home, I've visited Kabuku several times.  On my most recent visit, I tried a few items from the menu incuding avocado tempura, tamago nigiri, inari nigiri, and a kimino roll.  The avocado tempura was awesome with firm avocado and a light batter. It's often hard to find good vegetarian rolls at sushi places as many just default to the standard avocado/cucumber/carrot sticks so I was happy to experience something a touch more flavourful with the kimino roll. This roll includes fried tofu, shitaki mushrooms, avocado, asparagus, cucumber and carrot.  Ordering is easy at Kabuku as every table is provided with a laminated menu and a marker to tick off the types and number of rolls and pieces."}
{"text":"This place is meh. Usually quite packed at lunchtime for all the business lunch folk.  Seems like their really half ass their sushi and gouge you on the prices to take advantage of the downtown clientele. It's really just slightly better food court quality sushi in a nicer sit down restaurant."}
{"text":"I went on a weekday evening, later on. It was empty except for me. The service was really polite and pleasant. I had a rainbow roll and assorted nigiri. It wasn't very good. I've enjoyed this place in the past, but this time the fish was really salty, and the rice was not good, and it just all around wasn't what I would expect."}
{"text":"Great sushi in a cool restaurant.   I popped in here one evening for dinner with a coworker and it was delicious. The rolls here are delicious and very well prepared. Everything we were served was fresh and did not lack for an appealing plating. It can get a little pricy, so if you're short on money you might want to skip this one. The price is worth it though! The servers are all friendly and polite and are helpful if you're trying to determine portion sizing.  If you like sushi, you can't skip this place over."}
{"text":"This is a great Sushi Place; it is family oriented; we went there with few kids, all ages, felt really relaxed. Many other families with their kids were dining too. We ordered different Sushi plates, all good; service was OK too; and not too much wait time. I have been in Kabuku downtown too and the quality was the same."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the sushi is pretty decent.  The one thing is the service can be slow.  Many of the times I've been here after they clear the dishes they just let you sit there and don't bring you the check.  I've sat for 15 minutes before I could get a hold of someone to ask for my check.  I'm not sure if they feel like they don't want to rush you, but sometimes you've got places to go!  If you're not in a rush and don't mind sitting for awhile it might be OK, but if you've got to get back to work make sure you ask for a check towards the end of your meal or else you'll be waiting awhile."}
{"text":"By far the freshest and best portioned Sushi and Sashimi in downtown Calgary.   If you are Gluten Free, they significantly accommodate in all ways possible for the safest dining experience. I have never once had an issue in the 8 years of eating here.   The team. The owners. The staff, all make the time on the attention to detail and it shows in the final product that ends up on your table."}
{"text":"Sushi was wonderful and substantial. Service very friendly and a great location. As a result have returned again the next day."}
{"text":"Selected this place based on reviews on Yelp and being in the area.  Its a small quiet sushi restaurant. It's decor is not as flashy or trendy like some other sushi places in Calgary, but still newer and clean.   The menu had a good variety of sushi and sashimi entrees and the prices are inline with most other sushi places. Overall everything tasted pretty good and fresh. I liked the unique rare beef sushi (called Alberta on the menu). The plating was simple but looked appealing. We also tried the shrimp tempura specialty dish (Kara), the Alaskan salmon sushi and the Kamikaze sushi which is a spicy tuna.    I like knowing they use local beef and chicken as well as donate back to the Alberta Children's Hospital. I would happily come back to try this place again"}
{"text":"Located near the Westin Hotel. Went their for lunch and it was quite full. We were able to get a table in the corner near the window. The attire for the female wait staff was different, but it made it interesting.   We enjoyed the food there and would go back again. The staff was accommodating to our three year old - so that was a plus!   Their crispy calamari was tasty along with the three different  sauces! Sushi was good as well as the teriyaki chicken."}
{"text":"We came at lunch around 1pm and they apparently were only taking reservations or we had to wait in line, but it was only a 10 minute wait. Solid balance between quality and portion size. Their fish tastes fresh. We ordered agedashi tofu and although good I prefer globefish better. Their rock shrimp was the best I've ever had, even better than nobu in NY! I think it's their volcano sauce which has a nice combination of creamy, salty, spicy, and sour. Their salmon cone was a great balance between rice and fish. Overall a great place downtown to have sushi during lunch or dinner. You kind of get a laugh out of the names of some of the sushi as well ..anyone else agree?"}
{"text":"Just located across the Westin hotel, kabuku is a small Japanese restaurant that serves sushi, sashimi, and hot entrees / appetizers. Overall the service and the restaurant itself was fine. In fact, our server was quite enthusiastic and friendly during our dinner. However I found the food quite disappointing. The quality of the sushi was quite basic and prices were not necessarily great."}
{"text":"I'm visiting Calgary for work and this restaurant is conveniently located across from my hotel. It looked nice from the outside and I was in the mood for sushi, so I decided to give it a shot. One of the server's was standing right in the front and did not even acknowledge me for almost a minute, even though she clearly saw me standing there. Finally, she seated me. She was very abrupt and probably did not speak more than 15 words to me the entire time that I was there. There was another server across the way who was more engaging with her customers, so maybe I just got a bad one. I ordered the green salad with ginger dressing. It was ok. Not the best I've had, but not worst. I also ordered a sushi roll (the name of which I can't now recall). It was probably one of the worst sushi's rolls I've ever had in a sushi restaurant. The tuna on top did not taste fresh. It looked like it had been seared, but didn't have the seared taste. The rice holding the roll kept falling apart, causing each piece of the roll to fall into pieces.   I would not recommend this place to anyone, nor would I go back again if I came back to Calgary. The ambiance was ok, but the food was sub par. Being a frequenter of sushi restaurant and sushi bars, I feel like I know a thing or two about good sushi. This unfortunately was not good sushi."}
{"text":"If your looking for sushi or sashimi in Calgary, this place is pretty good.  The Wild Salmon Sashimi, service was good.  The Salmon Volcano is to die for and the service was very good as well."}
{"text":"This place is great, and conveniently located in downtown. I walked in after having a craving for sushi and was immediately greeted by the friendly staff and lovely ambience ZEN has to offer. The staff were wonderful and my tai-out order was ready in a flash! I love the modern decor, it made me wish I had stayed to dine-in. I took my sushi to go and trained home and was pleasantly surprised with how fantastic and delicious it was. I'm not sure how busy this place is at lunch, but I'd love to make ZEN a more regular occurrence. It seems pretty trendy and despite other reviewers, I didn't find the prices to bad. I think I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Fish was fresh tho portions were small (friend was not happy w size of sashimi. He left hungry). Haha. Menu limited (especially for me who has shrimp allergy). Staff friendly.   They have a second location in Aspen."}
{"text":"This place is reliable for quality, service and busy-ness. It's comfortable to have young kids here too"}
{"text":"Really good place...the food, drinks and ambiance were all solid 9/10  sushi - really fresh and delish! I tried some apps, scallops and shrimps it was pretty darn good.. the dumplings were one of the best i have had in a very long time! do not miss !  the staff was friendly and provided excellent service.   Uber Bang for the buck, in Calgary!"}
{"text":"First visit & was very happy with all aspects of the restaurant. The miso marinated black cod was excellent!"}
{"text":"Delicious sushi in the 'burbs. I came here for the aburi sushi and was left very satisfied. The fascination about this style of sushi came about a visit to Vancouver's Miku restaurant. It is nigiri style sushi that gets a nice light torched sear on the top providing a really nice smokey flavour to the buttery texture of the fish. At Kabuku you can choose from toro, sake, and hamachi (tuna belly, salmon, and yellowtail). All were delicious! The yam tempura here was also quite a treat as the yam still had the right amount of crunch but still tender. The sashimi had a nice fresh taste as well as the tobiko with quail egg nigiri sushi providing that nice blend of crunch and smooth you taste. Come hungry and you will want to try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Very good and fresh sushi!,.. This is definitely my favorite sushi place in Calgary!!.. As they fly the fresh fish everyday it is very very fresh!!.. Everything I have had there is just delicious!!.. I haven't found a better place for sushi at the city yet!!..   Tip: as it is sooooo good, it is always busy, I would recommend to call for reservations.. Or make the reservation online.."}
{"text":"Garbage sushi. Thinly sliced and they charge top dollar for this crap. I know things are going to go wrong when there's more Caucasian clientele than Asians."}
{"text":"No clue why this place is considered top ten places to eat in Calgary. Must be due to location. Took over half hour to get food and it was great but not amazing. Saturday night and not that busy.... weird and only one waiter. I ate dinner real fast as I was very over hungry and it was good enough to eat but I wouldn't come back again. But then the chocolate mint sticks came out so three stars!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine spent six months in Calgary, staying at the Westin across the street from ZEN. I understand that he was in here nearly every weekend and many week nights. So when he recommended that I give this place a try, I knew that it would be good. And he was right!  Interesting specials and well prepared \"edible art\", I had the toro sashimi special and the toro maki roll special. And when my tummy still had room, an order of the volcano chicken finished me off. All of it was absolutely excellent quality sushi and cooked food.  Draft Sapporo. Awesome!  Sadly, no wifi and the Starbucks across the street wasn't broadcasting.  You would never find this place if you didn't know it was here. They have a very plain entrance and not a lot of signage."}
{"text":"The sushi was excellent. The service was very good and very prompt.   The meal started with a hot towelette which won me over immediately. My dinner partner ordered sushi by the piece and I ordered the Shrimp & Tempura entree. We did not speak be uses the good was so good... we just kept eating. I had a glass of green tea and a Sapporo.   Very impressed. Will eat there again before we leave."}
{"text":"Went for a business lunch today at my fave restaurant, Zen 8.  My guest and I ordered from the sushi list:  - 2 orders of the green salad (delicious ginger dressing on fresh salad) - 4 Special Scallops Nigiri (my absolute favourite sushi) - 2 Unagi Nigiri (so fresh) - 6 pcs of Sashimi (big pieces of salmon) - 1 Spider Roll (really good!) - 1 Rainbow Roll (beautiful with salmon, ahi tuna and shrimp on the top of the roll.    Dessert: - 1 Green Tea Ice cream with mango fruit (not bad) - 1 Bernard Callebaut Frozen chocolate mousse with a mixed berry sauce and caramelized banana (Really, really good on a huge platter)"}
{"text":"A cute little sushi place in Aspen Woods.  They have a varied menu with some unique offerings.  I tried their Beef tataki as an appetizer and it was very fresh.    Next I tried the Volcano salmon, which is tempura cooked salmon with their volcano sauce and unagi sauce mixed in with fried onions and mushrooms.  It was very tasty.   All the sushi we tried was of good quality and very delicious.  Our service was also excellent.   The only suggestion I would make would be to increase the size of the sashimi play pieces.  As for the price the portion is too small."}
