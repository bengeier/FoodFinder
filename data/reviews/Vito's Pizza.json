{"text":"Their deep dish pizza rocks my world!! It's pricey but leaves plenty of leftovers. Yummmm"}
{"text":"Although deep dish is not what I grew up eating in Chicago, thin was the only way unless out of town guests came in, this is by far the best deep dish I've had since heaving Chicago.  The guy lived in Italy, then moved to my area of Chicago, and then here.  It's a long wait but TOTALLY worth it.  Get the deep dish with sausage.  It's real sausage (not rabbit pellets).  YUMMY!"}
{"text":"We went to Glendale for my son's game, not a lot of choices to eat near the school but I looked on yelp and found Vito's...had a good rating and the reviews were very good!  We drove in and were a little surprised to see a kind of \"hole in the wall\" type place in a strip mall but hey, I trust yelpers! We walked in and ordered 2 pizza's....the service was quick and the pizza was too die for! We left saying that we hoped our son played the same team next year so we would have a reason to return to this part of Glendale! Really really good pizza!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've never had a deep dish that was actually made in Chicago, but I can't imagine it gets much better than this. Just keep in mind, a pizza as big as theirs takes time to cook (around 45 min.), so call your order in or prepare to wait a while..."}
{"text":"this place was recommended to me by two older italian guys who have been around the block a few times. first, i've never had chicago deep dish style pizza. i've had plenty of sicilian pizza. i ordered the large deep dish with meat all over it. good quality pizza, alot of sauce, and lots of toppings. very flavorful. it's made  just like how a deep dish is suppose to be, but i thought it would be taller / deeper. don't get me wrong, it's a very good pizza. i thought the thickness of the dough was very similar to sicilian, rather then a deep pie. maybe this is how it's suppose to be? anyway, the large was very filling. there's alot of sauce & toppings. very small place. order ahead of time because of the 45 minutes it takes to cook. you can order it to go, or order and have it ready when you arrive. they serve alcohol as well. others i know swear by this place."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!!! This is as close to Chicago style pizza as you will find in the Valley. My husband and I have been out of the Chicago area since September and were desperately trying to find great pizza down here. Well, we had no such luck until we stumbled across Vito's.   It's quite a distance from our house in Goodyear, but worth every mile.   The service is great and we were able to speak with both owners on the two occasions we stopped in (definitely not our last time visiting) They are great guys and had no problem stopping what they were doing to chat with us.  The thin crust was great, cut in squares just like home :D   The deep dish, orgasmic. The seasonings the put on top of the sauce make it just like home, the crust is just right, sauce is just right and there is nothing bad to say about it!!   Each time we were in, we finished off the pizza with their homemade cannoli's. Let me just say, they are almost as good as my grandpa's were! Just missing the pistachios!    The general location is a bit... well, not nice, but I've learned that the best food often comes from the least expected places.   My husband and I will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"First time having deep dish pizza and was not disappointed. Their thin crust is really good too. Eaten here several times and the only negative thing from this place is the wings, Don't even bother with them."}
{"text":"We just went to Vidos pizza and I gotta say that was the most cheesiest pizza I have ever had! The sauce had good flavor and the pizza was filling. Good Customer service"}
{"text":"I have taken the time to order from Vito's pizza twice now since moving the Phoenix. I enjoy a flood deep dish pizza and thanks to yelp I was able to see the pictures of Vito's pizza before ordering.   Both times I've ordered both times I've been nothing but impressed and excited when the food arrived. I've ordered the deep dish meaty pizza. Honestly one of the most amazing pizzas I've ever eaten. Robust sauce that zings but doesn't drown the meat. Not overly cheesy or crusty.    Also both times my deliver fellow was one of the nicest most cheery delivery guys I've ever had the fortune to have bring me food. Honestly he enjoys himself and his job and it shows with his awesome demeanor.   Thirdly, I am outside their delivery area. But they still more than gladly brought the food my way. I couldn't be more thankful.   In summation, great people make great food for great reasons. And that's what matters"}
{"text":"We love their pizza,  never disappointed and 1 large pizza is enough for the 3 of us.  We are new to the area and feel blessed to have found this place."}
{"text":"Chicago Peeps - Authentic Chicago Pizza has been found! Tried both thin crust and stuffed and both were amazing. The area/location isn't ideal, but so worth the drive."}
{"text":"FIrst off, I will definitely be back. The location is a little sketchy, but nothing terrible. They do have a little dinning room that seemed to fill up quickly. I went there primarily for the pizza and the pizza was delicious. We did not get the deep dish. We didn't have enough time to wait. However, I will be back to try the deep dish. The thin crust that we ordered was delicious.   The only reason I take a star off is for the wings. They were terrible. I ate one and could not stomach anymore. The chicken tasted old or rotten. But again, that's not their specialty. Next time I will stick to just pizza."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I finally found a place that is close to Chicago deep dish pizza! I love the sauce and the crust is just right!! I order here once a week!!! Be sure to oder 45 min a head because you have to wait for awhile for a deep dish."}
{"text":"AMAZING Chicago style pizza! Really. Don't even have much else I can say. I LOVE pizza, and this is my favorite pizza."}
{"text":"Good deep dish, little pricey. Great service."}
{"text":"Being from Chicago the crave an actual deep dish Pizza and Vito's is it!  We try and get it weekly!"}
{"text":"Vito's has the BEST deep dish pizza in the Phoenix area! The crust is crunchy, the pizza has lots of sauce, cheese and fillings! It can take up to an hour to get your pizza, but it's well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I don't really like deep dish pizza, I usually prefer thin cust, but my girl loves it so after being let down by a few places and reading lots of reviews we tried Vitos. Wow the pizza was amazing! I will never eat deep dish pizza anywhere else again! I have been converted. Cant wait to eat there again!"}
{"text":"This was great! Perfect crust, perfect sauce! we had it delivered (we were on the edge of their delivery zone) Order early, this one takes a while to cook. We had a medium all meat deep dish and man was it a heavy box! Three of us ate 1/2 the pizza. Was craving a Chicago deep dish pizza and this did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Vito's is the decendent of White Cottage Pizza in Wood Dale IL, a suburb of Chicago. Vito and his wife retired a few years ago and transitioned the Pizzeria to other family members from Chicagoland.  The deep dish is authentic and WONDERFUL. It is tasty, the crust is flaky and the toppings are high quality. This IS the GO-TO place for Chicago style deep dish pizza.   Call ahead and avoid the 45 minute wait for one of these bad boys. While the strip shopping center is a strip shopping center, I have never had a bad experience and have found that parking is usually available right in front of the restaurant. There is a liquor store in the shopping center where one can purchase adult beverages to be enjoyed in the pizzeria.  Abondanza!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! They are tucked quietly in a corner behind sonics and next to a massage parlor! The place is small however the staff is amazong! I was greeted as soon as I walked through the door and the ladies went over the menu with me! I come from Chicago so trust me I know great pizza! I orderd the medium deep dish pizza with pepperoni,  Italian sausage, and ground beef! It took about 40 minutes to make so I suggest calling it in ahead of time! This pizza is amazing! The most authentic Chicago deep dish I have had outside of Chicago! The crust was perfect and the sauce was to die for! I drove 20 minutes home and the pizza was still gooey and warm! PERFECTION I will be back definitely worth the drive"}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed at all. For price I expect better quality. Chicago style Pizza was burnt and wings where not even crispy."}
{"text":"Read about the great pizza, out of town on business from Chicago. Saw they were open til 10pm, drove 20 minutes to get there, arrived at 8:40p only to be told that they didn't feel like making us a deep dish pizza because it took too long and we could get a thin crust instead. The restaurant was empty aside from us and we were shocked- who does that? They said they say they close at 10 but like to get out by 9/9:30. My advice? Call ahead to make sure they are even open or in the mood to make you a pizza. I mean, who does that???"}
{"text":"The Chicago pizza was decent but the sauce is pretty bland. Looking for something with more flavor!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza ... Good ChicAgo style when we missing The Chi! .... Just need a tiny bit more spice and be perfectooooo the sausage is great ... Wings are a little small but great flavor. The girls that work there could be a little bit more polite ... Wouldn't hurt any ;)"}
{"text":"We yelped deep dish pizza and the first listing was Vito's.  The pics looked great and it looked just as good when it arrived at the table.  We ordered the Vito's special but I didn't get sausage on my side.  It took a little while as a deep dish pizza should and we expected that.  Definitely worth the wait.  The sauce was tasty and there was plenty of cheese.  And we thought was perfectly done.  I would have given it five stars if the atmosphere was a little nicer but we will definitely be back when we get a craving for a deep dish pizza."}
{"text":"We come here 4 their Impressive Deep dish pizza's which r simply Spectacular!! Their sauce is not pasty tasting (hint of wine in it) & a couple slices feels like having eaten a full pizza in itself. We luv how saucy it is w/ their toppings underneath & the sauce on top as being that deep of a dish would b very hard 2 eat & probably caught in the throat w/o such~especially 4 the thickness it is. I'm always Amazed 1dering how they get their pizza dough so perfectly molded (2 fit all the generous portions of toppings & sauce in ur pizza pie). Really Luv our Fave = Deep Dish Tradition/style!!     Service always ranges from ok - good (depending on the server) inside the establishment which is nice inside, just not anything elabor8 ~ but why would it b as it's in a shopping center? Tables & chairs w/ disposable place~mats. But we're always there 4 the Awesome pizza anyhow & don't mind w8ing the li'l bit it takes 2 cre8 such goodness 4 our palate's & bellies, it' So Worth It!! Besides I can't imagine the disappointment of arriving home after having 2 hit the brakes a li'l 2 hard thx 2 horrible drivers we have 2 share the road w/ & c all that sauce satur8ing the box interior instead of it's perfected prepared present8ion when served up piping hot & fresh from the oven in back. MMM mmmm!!     Their Greek salad is gr8 but I luv the Vito's salad even more! We've also had their fried zucchini which always has the perfect consistency w/o being over~fried, or greasy~soggy underdone. Our fave deep dish pizza 2 order is their cheese & of course their Veggie which speaking of, their Veggie sub is pretty Amazing 2. We had a 1derful cannoli & tirumisu 4 dessert which is melt~in~ur~mouth yumminess! We Luv coming here whenever we can & I always like supporting local family owned & oper8ed establishments (this 1 has been here over 20 + yrs that I know of) which is rather self~explanatory speaking volumes over & above big~name places just across the street that hardly lasted even a yr!! Have Always Luved Vito's, always will..."}
{"text":"Many of the reviews on here are far too exaggerated. I am originally from Chicago and the pizza at Vito's is not even close to what we have there. It is quite a step even below Barro's, which I enjoy but is also not a good representation of Chicago.  I am speaking in regards to their deep dish, which is all that I have tried here. The pizza is not awful. It is pizza and when is pizza ever bad? However, it is nothing special and definitely below average. The prices are very high considering the quality of pizza. We spent over $30 for one pizza and a small side. For that price I expect something a lot better, so I don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"I ate here in the mid 90's, and I still remember it as the best pizza I've ever had in Phoenix.  I just typed it in here to see if it still existed, and sure enough, it's there.    Vito's, here I come."}
{"text":"This is when those places that at night it's pretty sketchy to go into it's right behind a Sonic and a old little strip center by a gym a liquor store a Chinese restaurant a massage parlor no lights at night really random building mugging waiting to happen right but finally got in here to try it seriously I've had a lot of the Chicago style pizzas their thin crust is the best I've ever had their deep dish was okay I think I just don't like deep dish too hard or something it's almost like cake flour last anywhere you go but the thin crust Italian beef and hot peppers was so delicious little bit of a sweet sauce but not too sweet the cheese was really good too definitely a place to stop if you're in the area but that weird hours so check or call them first and not too badly price"}
{"text":"Was a Chicago style deep dish.  Homemade type crust, good sauce. I ordered extra cheese, Italian sausage, canadian bacon and jalepeno!! Was GOOD AND definitely filling!!!"}
{"text":"We have been coming to Vito's for several years - like everyone else, we can't get enough of their deep dish pizza! - and never have had any complaints. Today, we ordered a deep dish pie for pickup and did not check the box until we got home.. Only to find that it was a thin crust! We live within 10 minutes of the place and called to see if they had given us the wrong pizza accidentally. I thought we could simply go back and get the correct one, or they could bring it to us, since we live in delivery distance. The girl - who took the order, rang me out, and answered this phone call - simply gave a very insincere apology with no plan to offer to fix the problem; after a minute of impasse I asked in a very sarcastic manner if we should just keep the pizza.. To which she replied yes!! We did, and it was delicious, but that's just not good customer service! I am very sad to say that we will have to find a new favorite pizza place :("}
{"text":"First, let me begin by insisting that you ignore the fact it's in a questionable neighborhood next to a shady massage parlor. Most of the good food in Phoenix is that way (and if you didn't know that, get out of your hole).  This place isn't the best for dine-in, however, their delivery area isn't big enough for us all to enjoy the eat-at-home service.... So I recommend making the trip (cheaper than flying to Chicago to get deep dish this good).  The sauce is orgasmic. I will be having dreams about it for the next few days. Luckily, their smallest pizza is enough to feed me for a few more days. The wait is what you'd expect from good deep dish (40-45 minutes). Do not come here if you are in a hurry (or any pizza place for that matter).  It's good, very good. Why not 5 stars? The little things. Chicago style pizzas... No references to Chicago. WHOLE bunch of Italy though. As big as the pizzas are... It's not built for groups. Lots of carbs, nothing light and refreshing which would be nice to finish off a hefty pizza. All of the appetizers are huge portions. That being said it's also not really good for just 2 people. Probably why all the tables seat exactly 4. Double date, bring a small family, and you'll be fine.  On the flip side...Server was attentive when she needed to be and friendly. Price is good, quantity is excellent, food is excellent. The place is clean, I'll be back to try more."}
{"text":"Most amazing wings this chubby girl has ever had!!! The pizza is bomb too but those wings are ridiculousness"}
{"text":"Do NOT order BBQ wings. Pretty sure they we basically dipped in BBQ sauce or ketchup after being microwaved. Also, very pricey. Bad experience."}
{"text":"Deep dish pizza here is incredible. Doesn't get better. It's expensive for the deep dish, but worth it. I disagree that the pizza is far too saucy, it is awesome.  Wings are fantastic too."}
{"text":"So where do you go after 9PM to get some great food in Glendale? I was looking to find some grub to soak up some beer and we tried to go downtown Glendale to find something open. Besides Pete's nothing seemed to be open so I used a smart app to track down some pizza.  My order was taken quickly over the phone and asked for a thin crust extra crispy. I love old school neighborhood pizza joints and this little gem had been off my radar just  because I don't do this neighborhood very often.  The classic Chicago thin crust seems to be the awkward step child of the behemoth Deep Dish that made the town so famous but this my friends is the great American Pizza.  Don't get me wrong, New York pizza is great and love all that grease but something about having your items smothered in cheese on an old fashioned party cut (square) pie to me is the best. Excellent pizza, home made sausage! Great pie. Reminds me of the old Geno Pizza locations that we used to have around the valley."}
{"text":"I'm not overly impressed with Vito's deep dish or thin crust...I found the deep dish to be extremely hard on the bottom, relatively flavorless.  Sad as I feel as though the crust ruined what should've been an excellent pie!  The sauce,cheese, toppings are fine, just not impressed with a crust they give you a steak knife to cut through, it's just not supposed to be that way...The thin crust pie I had was just the same.  Flavorless, unimpressive crust, really a shame based on all of the other reviews.  I wanted to love this place and drove clear from Scottsdale to check it out.  Not thinking I'll be back as there's much better choices across the valley..."}
{"text":"I've only had their thin crust pizza and it's ok.  I've also tried their calzones.  They were kind of soggy and had way too much cheese.  I felt like I had ordered a cheese calzone, when I paid for good, tasty toppings.  I would never get a calzone from here again.  Also, they have a drive-thru pick-up window, which is good for take out."}
{"text":"The call in for delivery was fast and pleasant. I was promised the pizza around an hour. Don't time your nap around that, because you'll probably be woken up earlier. Delivery guy was pleasant and delivered a hot pizza.  I must warn you: bring a rolling table to the door. Not only is the pizza hot, but it's heavy. Heavier than my baby-dog-child, who's 7 lbs. Ha! Yeah, I know what I just said... As for the taste of this elephant the sauce is wonderful the toppings is flavorful, I just wish they gave the option of Gorgonzola because the mozzarella is a little bland. I will still continue to order from these elephant breeders. I'll just make sure I order a small (or maybe half a small?) because this is going to last all week."}
{"text":"Vitos is known as the best deep dish in AZ.  Let me tell you.  When they say deep they mean deep.  You could swim in this bad boy.  They throw half the kitchen in it.  Sauce, cheese, bell peppers, cheese, carrots, sunken treasure, etc.  One slice can fill up a full grown man.  No lie.  The outside crust is pretty good.  After getting over the shock of the size (thats what she said) the pizza was just ok.  The sauce was alright but not fabulous.  And for that much sauce on one slice of pizza it should be knock out good to keep you going.  The wife and I ate about 2 and a half slices and wondered what in the world will we do with the other 8.  Seriously, how can people be starving out there when Vitos is making 20 lb pizzas?  I have recommended this place to a couple of coworkers who live nearby it and were looking for a deep dish.  I would be down to go back and try something else on the menu.  From what I've read the owners have been around forever and know their stuff.  Maybe that deep dish just wasnt so much for me."}
{"text":"Really good pizza awesome mozzarella sticks. Giving it a 4 instead of a 5 because the waitress was just sitting there watching us as we ate. She was very nice but it was just uncomfortable. It's a small little place not recommended for big parties but the pizza is awesome. We had the thin crust cheese and a pepperoni large  Excellent we will be ordering from them but this time as a take out instead or maybe delivery :)"}
{"text":"Vito's has the best Chicago style pizza in the Valley.  The owner is friendly and truly cares about his product. He recognizes my wife and I every time we visit.  We always have good, service and excellent food."}
{"text":"This is as good as it gets when the word pizza is mentioned! Sausage is second to none. You can tell the owner cares! This is a must if you like pizza"}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago and have been living in Arizona for a year. I've tried several pizza places claiming to have Chicago's best but I was always disappointed, that's until I tried Vito's. This is by far the best place I've had in Arizona."}
{"text":"I'm not sure exactly how we found this place but my boyfriend and I were on a hunt for a new date spot. He mentioned Chicago style pizza, which I've never had. Got there and the waitress was super friendly and so were the other staff that were there. The menu states to allow 45 minutes for it to cook. I don't know if it was just me or the conversation we were having but it did not seem like 45 minutes. It got to our table at a reasonable amount of time. We ordered the small, which included 8 HUGE slices. I was satisfied with one and I must say we were both very pleased with everything. The sauce was tasty, cheese was melty, crust was soft and crispy, and overall the pizza was amazing. This will definitely now be our to-go pizza joint."}
{"text":"Yum! Had a Canadian bacon and pineapple deep dish pizza. I was craving a taste of Chicago. Sauce was good and pizza tasted delicious!"}
{"text":"smaller place, BIG PIZZA - classic Chicago style (sauce on top).  Bring your appeitite as you will need it for sure.  Sadly, they don't service beer/wine but are a BYOB place which is great!"}
{"text":"used to be good when VITO owned it--now the new owner has changed it-- i wouldnt go back now-- no one in there now-not a good sign"}
{"text":"This is so rigged ( besides Dazzo's place is off the hook only down fall cash only) ABC 15 didn't due its homework in deep dish Pete only putting up mainstream pizza spots like really I kind of don't want to give this spot only because I don't want to see you fuckers at my spot but fuck it here it goes you guys might say what does he know about Chicago pizza this fat boy from Ca well the love of pizza doesn't know borders and hands down the best Chicago deep dish and thin crust style pizza is at no other place but Vito's on 43 and northern and now they don't pay me to say this or give me any free pizza or discount( would be nice)"}
{"text":"Went there late night last weekend as not many options were there. As per me I did not like the pizza taste at all. May be not according to my liking."}
{"text":"Being from Chicago, I have high standards for deep dish pizza.  Thankfully, Vito's does not disappoint.  I definitely recommend this place for your next pizza dinner.  Driving there, I was a bit leery of the strip mall it is located in.  It looked dirty and sketchy, but we decided to give it a shot.  Once inside, the place cleans up nicely.  There are 8 or so tables to sit at, and at 6pm on a Friday night, about half of them were full.  Over the next hour and a half, the room stayed about half full.  A lot of people came in to pick up to go orders, which seems like the smart play if you live nearby.  Throughout the evening, the service was great.  Our server walked right up to us once we sat down.  She quickly took our order and informed us that it would take about 40 minutes for the deep dish pizza.  We ordered the small Vito's classic, with their homemade sausage, green peppers, onions, and tomatoes.  40 minutes later, a gigantic deep dish pizza came out that was delicious!  It was much bigger than we expected for a \"small\".  There were 8 slices in total, and I couldn't eat more than 2 of them.    Overall, it was a great place.  Excellent service, delicious food, and comfortable interior.  The deep dish pizza is as good as advertised.  The crust was perfect!  Definitely give this place a try, and don't worry about its outside appearance -- the food makes up for all of it."}
{"text":"Dough is bland. Cheese is nothing special. Sauce is WAY too salty, to the point its hard to enjoy the rest of the pizza. Everything is very overpriced and quality is just not there."}
{"text":"The deep dish was a little disappointing maybe the thin will be my next choice. I will give them another shot."}
{"text":"Pizza is good! First time I ordered a pizza there everything was fine. The next time I ordered, was before the Mayweather/Paquiua fight, 2 Lg sausage/pepperoni pizzas, they charged me almost $60! I never, ever went back!"}
{"text":"The pizza is amazing. Homemade sauce and real ingredients you can not beat. My waitress Katie was fantastic, attentive and personable. I would recommend this place to anyone who is looking for Chicago style pizza or just pizza in general."}
{"text":"Pizza is great! Crust is awesome, homemade sausage is fabulous! Horrible in attentive staff. We were the only table and  both waitresses  ignored us the entire time.  Unfortunately the service was so disappointing that I will not return."}
{"text":"When the original owners had this it was so good, they sold it but let the new owners use the name Vito's..I did order our usual after the take over and believe me , we will not be back."}
{"text":"Pizza here is pretty good. Cheese was ok. I like the thin crust and pepperoni tasted good. Ranch was homemade but a little watered down. Service and delivery were great. Fast and friendly!"}
{"text":"We read the reviews & took a chance!!! We are from the Chicago area. It was Awesome!!! It came hot, fresh & fast!!! The kids enjoyed there sausage & Pepperoni. We enjoyed our sausage onion and bacon!!!"}
{"text":"Nothing like I remember it being. The Crust was tough and not much flavor. Cheese was okay the pepperoni was average at the best. Way to expensive for this will not be trying again."}
{"text":"Heard alot about the deep dish from Vito's so I thought I would try it out. You know that tingling feeling u get in your special places when u ride a roller coaster and u take that first huge dip? That's how I felt when I took my first bite of their deep dish. It was that good. I will no doubt be going there again."}
{"text":"So good. Had a house salad with ranch it was so fresh and delicious. Husband had the wings and said they where amazing. Neither of us where prepared for the amazing deep dish pizza we got. So good, it felt like the fastest deep dish I've ever had at a restaurant. This place is such a hidden gem. This was my first time here and we will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing experience! Crust was doughy and not cooked all the way through. I found Vito's Pizza by reading an article on MSN.com- https://www.msn.com/en-us/foodanddrink/restaurantsandnews/the-best-deep-dish-pizza-outside-of-chicago/ss-AAvOcI5?li=BBnb7Kz#image=10 . We paid $32 + tip to get a pizza we couldn't eat. I'll stick with Lou Malnati's and get great pizza every time! BTW, the delivery driver was way cool!"}
{"text":"I've never had Chicago style pizza before but I've been wanting to try it. Vito's was beyond delicious. Definitely in my top 5 best pizzas I've ever eaten. Me and my boyfriend ordered a small deep dish pizza and we were only able to eat half of it. Very filling and so yummy !"}
{"text":"I'm no pizza expert by any means but I have probably eaten hundreds, possibly thousands, of pizzas in my lifetime and this one definitely made an impression on me!  My friend and I have been in search of a good deep dish pizzas in the Phoenix area for quite some time now and one that embodies what Chicago style truly is. This pizza was really, really, really good. As I learned from Chicago pizza eating experts, the crust should be light, flaky and almost biscuit like. The crust did not have that texture. It was denser. The slices are indeed thick as expected.  It was my first time eating a pizza with the sauce over the cheese, and I was told, \"this is as it should be.\" It didn't matter to me how it should be though because I loved every bite of it! I don't care if it's in a not so great part of town! I am coming back for more and I am recommending it to people looking for extra good deep dish pizza!"}
{"text":"This used to be my go-to pizza place back when I lived west side. Though on occasion we get pizza from there on our way to Surprise to visit by bff and its still just as awesome as I remember it.   Seriously, this is not pizza for the faint of heart. Super thick, inverted topping pizza that's so tasty and so filling we dubbed it \"gut bomb\" since one slice will pretty much do you. Yes, the pizzas are that huge and dense!   Beware though, the location is definitely iffy, so watch your back. However some places are worth the risk."}
{"text":"Yes Sir!  Better than Rosati's, Lucky's, Ray's, Stevie's, Jojo's and even Giordano's!  Great pizza and excellent customer service at a fair price.  Not a huge fan of the neighborhood, but the pizza made up for it.  I recommend carry out."}
{"text":"We recently moved into the area and are trying all of our local pizza places in turn.  Vito's gets the thumbs down, we will not order again.  The hot wings are not a \"buffalo\" sauce; they must not be using Frank's red hot.  They are a red sauce, but they do not have that tangy buffalo flavor...the hot wings are killer spicy, but somehow have no flavor.  All spice, no interest.  The thin crust pizza crust is a cracker-style crust; it has no flavor either, and it doesn't have that chewy bite that you want from pizza crust.  Their tomato sauce also is flavorless.  Overall very boring pizza experience; in a word, disappointing.  Even the national chains do it better.  They cut their pizza in little squares, not triangles.  I like crust, so this is my least favorite way of cutting a pizza....if you get a middle piece it is soggy and crustless.  So, bleh.  I'm annoyed that I spent good money on this pizza.  Crossing it off the list.  To be fair, I didn't order the deep-dish that they are famous for (because I dislike deep-dish in general). Apparently I much prefer NY style pizza, not Chicago.  And for the record, I am Italian-American.   Sigh.  I miss the pizza from my old hood (Aiello's)."}
{"text":"The deep dish pizza is pretty good,  despite the reviews I guess it's one of those places that you have to try you either like it or you don't but in my opinion it was pretty good."}
{"text":"Vitos   Shitty lil strip mall...good pizza.   I had been driving around for a new place to check out, since it feels like forever since I reviewed anywhere. I miss ma Yelp.   place #1 closed for the day  place #2 appeared to be closed down   Desperate and hungry i found Vitos via Yelp and was ahh what ev...   I ordered the thick crust and listened to other yelpers talk shit about coworkers, chatted with a guy from Surprise and waited.   The pizza was good, sauce was a bit salty but I liked it. The crust was thick chewy on the inside and crispy on the bottom. It was good.   After 2 slices and one more bit of the corner of one more slice, I packed the rest to go. The neighbor kid was walking by as I drove up so he was in for a good snack as I gave him the left overs.   Would I go back? Maybe if I were in the area or suggesting it to someone but it is not better then Barros to me. Sorry."}
{"text":"I took the family back to my roots for a night at my old favorite pizza joint. Vito's has not changed a bit and is still rocking the best Chicago style pizza in the valley. As others have mentioned, the area is a little suspect but the food is on point. If your questioning the location, it is so worth doing carry out or just bring your friend Smith and Wesson.  Given this area feels like home to me, I elected to have a sit down meal with the wife and daughter and enjoyed every minute.  Upon entering, we were greeted and taken care of by two great ladies. I called our order in twenty minutes prior, knowing the deep dish would take 40 minutes. With that said, they had our house salad ready on arrival and it was awesome. After filling up on salad and waiting for just a few minutes, my memories came flooding back as their meaty medium Chicago style pizza was laid in front of my eyes. Oh how I had missed their pies!!! The crust was perfect, the sauce... perfect, the meat.... perfect, the cheese.... oh so perfect. There was nothing about the pie that could be improved. My family loved every bit of it.  We finished our meal with a couple tasty cannoli's and drove home full and satisfied.  A five star pie experience that I would put up against Lou Malnati's any day of the week.  FYI-Plan on leftovers."}
{"text":"True Chicago style pizza!!! Just ordered another, extra thin half sausage half pepperoni, crispy. With side of fries. Getting delivered!"}
{"text":"Chicago style thin crust.... YUM!    Here's the deal.  Moving from Illinois, I had a really hard time finding a good pizza place in PHX... This is pretty typical.  After the first year, I figured that Rosati's was as good as it was going to get.. And don't get me wrong, Rosati's is good... But then I found Vito's.  I freaking love Vito's.  Pineapple and pepperoni thin crust.  So damn good.  It's my favorite comfort food.  YUM YUM YUM YUM! Oh yea.  And garlic bread with cheese."}
{"text":"If you are from Chicago and enjoy deep dish pie  this is the place to go to. The sauce is perfect and both the deep dish and thin crust taste a little like home. They offer extra thin if you like, however it's not listed on the menu. They also have byob if you want to eat there. The Italian beef is fair but nothing as good as Lukes or portillios. Stay with the pie and you will be happy."}
{"text":"Bam! The deep dish pizza is off the chain! And the girl who takes my order when I call is actually friendly and helpful...which is extremely uncommon for a pizza joint."}
{"text":"Vitos is amazing pizza and great service. This was only my 2nd time having chicago deep dish pizza. The first being in Chicago. It was very good and we have ordered Vitos so many times I lost count. Glad we live close by!!"}
{"text":"Yup.. FIVE STAR BABY.!!!   Positives: This is the best deep dish pizza you will EVER eat.  My husband brought me here (we live in Goodyear but drove)  he used to eat here when he was growing up. I can't say enough positives about this food.  Two slices of this pizza and you are stuffed. The salad is unbelievable. It has both green and black olives with pepperoni.  We couldn't get enough of this salad! The cannelloni dessert was Sooo good.    The staff was very kind and we loved being there.  It is clean and cozy inside.   Negatives:  I can't lie, this location is a bit run down. The area is not where we normally would go.. But it is worth it.  Don't let the area fool you. It's a real gem on the inside.   This place is a keeper for our family!"}
{"text":"After noticing this place from living in the area I looked up the reviews and was excited to see that most gave this place rave reviews.   I ordered the deep dish Vito's special since it was highly recommended and went to pick it up..you can tell this pizza had some weight to it. Pizza was super tasty, smothered with rich tomato sauce, peppers, onions and sausage on a soft cheesy perfectly cooked crust. My mouth is watering as I write this lol. I can't wait to try all of them.   Now I have lived in what I consider one of the nicer neighborhoods near Vito's and while its not The Biltmore this strip mall isn't as bad as most claim. It's actually really clean with some nice local businesses in it. I find myself lucky to claim this little neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"We got delivery, girl on the phone wasn't friendly at all. Delivery dude was cool. Apparently we're out of his area. Not his fault. The pizza tasted amazing! Freaking awesome! One bad thing and just being picky was the mushrooms didn't taste fresh, kinda slimy, can style. The marinara sauce was great! I'm telling myself the dough was made inhouse cause it was pretty good. Price was a bit much. One hell of a deep dish pizza!"}
{"text":"Omg! Love their deep dish. Friendly staff. Their cheese bread is delicious as well. They are now open on Sunday's great for football season."}
{"text":"I've been to Vitos about 4-5 times.  I live 45 mins away... Totally worth the drive.  The bread and zucchini are my fav way to start my meal.. DON'T eat too much because the food is going to make u so full!  The Deep dish pizza is to DIE for... I admit to being a food snob.  I believe in using good ingredients and creating flavors that you can't get in every other pizza shop.  VITOS is KING!!!!  They make their own sausage, sooo good, and their sauce isn't too sweet from the basil.  Their crust has some sweetness to it; it is not over powering or distracting to the food.  The sweetness creates a balance to the overall pizza.  The texture is PERFECT!  I'm making myself hungry.  Really, this place is a BIG surprise!  You will love it!  FYI: BYOB, if u want soda or Iced tea they got u covered!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza.... service was freindly.     Wings were nothing special.   Deep fried with some sauce squirted on.... but be ready to spend some $$!!      50 bucks for pizza - small wings a salad and 3 sodas. Before tip!     Get the pizza to go,    would have been ideal.    Same thing delivered from Sardellas or Tico's would have been $30.      If you want deep dish be prepared to wait 45 mins.   I wasn't impressed with the atmosphere either, no comfy booths, pretty basic boring decor was clean but  smelled funny.   But pizza was good.  For now on I'll do take out."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago and one of my friends moved to Scottsdale and recommended this place as something equivalent to our 3rd best deep dish in Chicago but the best available in the Phoenix area.  He was spot on.   The pizza is pretty good, it is the best you can get without having the cool specialties like butter crust or slab sausage that covers the whole pizza.  But definitely try the Vito specialty Deep Dish, it is good pizza and I would go back for sure :)  The service is good as well and it has a very homely feel to it :)  I wanted to try the tiramisu but was so stuffed after my one piece of the large (which fed 4 of us with 4 slices left over, mmm)  I did have a piece of pizza bread and a sliver of fried zucchini though, both of which were pretty good."}
{"text":"I love this place! The best deep dish pizza I've ever had the pleasure of eating. The sauce is amazing!!!!!"}
{"text":"OMG...  best  deep dish pizza I've ever had.  You have to try this!!  Almost gave thre stars bc they don't open til 3pm on Saturday, but it was worth the wait. All was hot, you can tell they didn't fill the cannoli until it was ordered, and the delivery guy was polite and kind."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza. The best I've had in Phoenix for sure. Had a thin crust sausage, onion, and mushroom. The crust was a little too thin and crusty compared to Chicago pizza, but the toppings were right on! Definitely will be back. Thanks Vito!"}
{"text":"Incredible experience! Food was fantastic! We had the Vito's special deep dish pizza. The flavor explosion was something else. It was perfectly cooked, the sauce was wonderful and spices matched perfectly. This place is a can't miss for pizza. Don't pass by this place. Once you try it you will be begging to come back."}
{"text":"It's an overly-air infused crust+inflated owner ego=eh!  Nice counter girls, beer sold in the tiny center, but I'm not coming back. Raffaele's for me!"}
{"text":"Still nomming on Vito's!!!!!!!! So freaken tasty! The pizzas arrive piping hot and full of toppings! Not many places have green olives as a topping option, but thank the stars above that Vito's does!"}
{"text":"Being from the midwest, I'd been looking for a place that served Chicago-style deep dish pizza and Yelp helped me locate this place (which just happened to only be about 2 miles from where I live). Vito's was really good! As it was just me, I had lots of leftovers and they reheated well in the microwave and I think may have even tasted better the 2nd day. Don't let the location scare you away, give it a try."}
{"text":"Ordered the Vito's Special Pan, girl behind the counter was very personable. First time trying Vito's and it definitely did not disappoint, definitely one of the best pizzas I have ever had. Would absolutely recommend!"}
{"text":"I've only had the deep dish pizza from here so that's the only thing I can speak to. It is simply ridiculous. Maybe even obnoxious. Legit Chicago-style deep dish. The large has to weigh 15 pounds. I've only found a few places around town that have this style of pizza and Vito's is hands-down the best I've had. It's a behemoth. The crust is just unbelievable. It's actually almost approaching a flaky piecrust consistency. They get a double thumbs-up for accommodating my order once right before they were going to close for the night. They say to allow 45 minutes for this pizza and they actually had somebody wait a few extra minutes to close the store so I could come pick up the pizza. Awesome."}
{"text":"I first read about Vito's after they popped up on a list of \"Best Pizza\" options in Phoenix a few years ago. It seemed odd, as most places on this list were far more popular and well known, while Vito's is more of a hole-in-the-wall location that I'd imagine I'd probably overlook under most circumstances.  I haven't explored their entire menu, but I'm quite familiar with their deep dish pizza. In my opinion, it's far superior to what you'd get at the ever so popular Oregano's in terms of its flavor and quality.  After recently experiencing Lou Malnati's and being greatly disappointed, I still feel that you'll find a much better product at Vito's.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Don't tell people you close at 9 if you're going to refuse to serve them at 8:20!! I would have appreciated saving a trip by being given this information when I called. Train your staff."}
{"text":"I was impressed with the service and the family owned feel of the place. The pizza. Not so much. I agree with other reviewers that it is far too saucy. And not in a good way! And that the sauce is indeed too salty. We only ordered one pie and it was really, extremely filling. The boy and I only had a slice each and split another.   I will most definitely be back to try some other things on the menu though. I am sure that there will be something I like."}
{"text":"I am absolutely addicted to the deep dish cheese pizza! if you are not a fan of saucy pizza, this pie is not for you. The sauce and crust are yummy and because the sauce is on top, it gives the pizza a different texture...and the pizza crust never gets soggy, so it makes for great leftovers the next day (or even longer). I have tried their supreme, but am more satisfied with just plain ole cheese. I would not recommend eating in because the atmosphere is bland and there is no alcohol to pass the time as the deep dish is a 45 min wait. I really would give this a half more of a star but there is no option for that:/ I would also like to add I have never been to Chicago and from what I hear from real Chicago pizza eaters is that this is not it; but for a born and raised Arizonan---I love it- it is very different than any other pizza I've had:)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love, love, love their deep dish meat lovers pizza. It lasts us a good 3 days because it's so big! It takes a little while because it's deep dish, but so worth the wait. This is a hidden gem! We have only ordered delivery, but never have been disappointed. This is making me hungry just writing this review!"}
{"text":"Their deep dish pizza is amazing, I've never had a bad pizza from Vito's. Thick sauce and great toppings"}
{"text":"Vito's has great authentic Chicago style pizza (cut into squares!) and I have only ever had great experiences with the food and service. The delivery is certainly a bit longer than chain pizza places but the wait is worth it."}
{"text":"We were looking for a real Chicago style pizza place to make our book club about a Chicago based story more authentic. And Vito's pizza was a hit!  The sauce flavors were awesome. Everyone liked the uniqueness of the sauce on top style and enjoyed the pizza a lot! It was a bit of a drive, but worth it in the end. Price wise it is a bit higher than anyone would like for a pizza, no doubt. But the product more than delivered.  We had a deep dish pepperoni and a thin crust cheese pizza. The deep dish was really tasty. I was impressed with how good the dough and cheese were. The sauce was thick and tasty also.  Everyone in the club was a fan!"}
{"text":"Fabu-licious!  Quiet little place in a sketchy looking strip mall in Glendale. Don't judge a book by it's cover though!   We ordered the deep dish regular cheese pizza with garlic added in. It takes 45 minutes for a deep dish pizza. In the meantime, we ordered garlic cheese bread and fried zucchini for appetizers. Both delicious.   The pizza finally arrived and it was AMAZING! Probably the best deep dish pizza I've ever had.   For dessert, we ordered the Tirmasu, which was heavenly.   The service was great. Very attentive and brought us whatever our demanding, large party wanted. They even allowed us to bring our own wine and drink it there. No corking fee.   When we arrived at 6:30pm, the restaurant was empty, but by the time we left at 7:45pm, there were several tables filled and lots of people stopping in to get take out.   I will definitely come back to this little, hidden gem. It's worth the wait for the deep dish pizza! You can even call ahead and pick it up when it's ready. Try it, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I was quite surprised that this quality can come out of Glendale!  I'm not a huge fan of deep dish pizza but I will make an exception for Vito's!  I crave it nightly.  I have had pizza from the best places around the world (Lombardi's- Manhattan, Gino's east- chicago, Giordano's - Chicago, Grimaldi's, Pizzeria Gino Sorbillo-Milan (voted best in ITALY! 2015), Juliana's - Brooklyn, Spinato's, AND Little Caesars (right.)  It's crazy that Vito's, for me, ranks among them!  If you decide to try, you won't be disappointed.  The location and atmosphere screams \"average at best\" but try to look past it and get a pie."}
{"text":"I went to Chicago, fell in love with deep dish and PRAYED to find something here. after searching and searching, I found this place and i saw the great reviews and was so excited!  I ordered the large cheese deep dish.  DISGUSTING! the crust is soft and bready. In chicago, the crust is crunchy and flaky. the sauce tasted like articial canned sauce. In chicago, the sauce tastes like they just mashed up some fresh tomatoes.  I could probably get frozen deep dish from wal mart that would taste better."}
{"text":"This is a great little place to get some Chicago style pizza. The place is small and in an older shopping center, but the inside is nice and clean. The Garlic cheese sticks are good and cheesy. I ordered the medium meat pizza and it was way too much for two people to eat. We had five slice left over. We would definitely return again."}
{"text":"My Yelp search for \"deep dish pizza\" kept yielding this place as a result, so I felt obligated to try it. I did so twice, to have both thin crust and deep dish pizzas.  The thin crust, for lack of an original term, is nothing to write home about. The cheese was alright, but that was about it. It was tasty, but nothing that would impress me.  The deep dish pizza was a bit more satisfying. The crust itself was pretty flavorful, and the toppings rich. I'm no deep dish pizza expert, but from what I've had, the cheese is usually piled on. There wasn't so much on this pie. Too bad, that would have made it shine a bit more. I'm not a fan of all that sauce slathered on. It's very salty, and even though it's admittedly tasty I found it harder to stomach after one slice. And trust me, I have a big stomach.  I see a few options here and there like sandwiches, but I guess that's to be expected from a restaurant like this. The place is very small, but the waiter's cool and there's usually a game on. What initially flirted with two stars won me over with charm and simplicity. Is it a decent pie? Yes. Does it deserve the \"Best of Phoenix\" award? Hell no."}
{"text":"Best Chicago style pizza that I've found in the area so far. Cheesy garlic bread and mozzarella sticks were pretty good as well."}
{"text":"First off , I have never gotten out of that restaurant without paying at least $30. WIth a family of four , around $80+ not including drinks. The food is okay if you like a slice of pizza that is mainly made up of sauce and bread with barely any cheese or toppings.So much sauce , it was like soup! Then to top off the crappy food was the staff. It is 100+ degrees outside and they had a problem with us wearing shorts and flip flops. But hey they still let us in. Maybe the reason our food was crappy was because they didn't like our clothes. Until things change , I won't be wasting any more money here.  I suggest that if this restaurant wants to survive , they need to re think their menu , and straighten up the employees attitudes , big time.  And to everyone else who put more than 3 stars on your review , either you don't have tastebuds , or you got paid to do your review."}
{"text":"Simply put: best deep dish ever! My family and I have been going here for as long as I can remember!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! I absolutely love coming here to order their monstrous sized pizzas for a low price."}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas I've ever eaten. I don't give 5 stars but this place is the BUSINESS. The cook was drinking espresso and watching Good Fellas when we came in. Chicago style deep dish was incredibly hardy and the pizza sauce was explosive - layered with very tastey Italian sausage and different parmesan cheeses. Crust was firm enough to eat with hands, despite being loaded. I love garlic & you need to as the sauce is super garlicy good. My wife isn't into Chicago style so we also ordered the thin crust pizza. It was exceptionally good as well. Super thin crust was firm - we did the Margarit with basil and tomatoes - lite and delicious. I can't recommend this place enough. It costs a bit more but there are leftovers a'plenty and the quality is unsurpassed."}
{"text":"As I am a HUGE deep-dish Chicago Pizza lover and this Vito's got rave reviews from two or three peers, as well someone I have begun to respect on Yelp, I had to try it. I...was...NOT...disappointed!  This has to be one of the best pizza's I've ever had. I got the 14\" deep dish, one item - Pepperoni. Though a little pricey at $18+ - I went to go pick it up, for that alone, I don't expect to pay too much - it was worth every bite.  I have to say Uno's is still my favorite - though I heard it shut down here in AZ!! ARG! - this comes in a very, very close second. It's the crust that did it for me. I liked Vito's, but the buttery Uno's is just simply better. And it's definitely best for takeout or delivery as the entire dining room seems like it could fit in my car's trunk.   HIGHLY recommended. Despite my situation on the price, I will be going here from now. Or make that, delivery. Not only is the neighborhood a piece of (work) but Northern Ave currently isn't fun to drive down, especially when you have the pizza on the seat next to you, looking up at you wondering: Seriously, what's taking so long?  (Overall rating: 4/5 Stars. The following is rated by \"out of five\" stars.)  Ambiance: 2 - only due to the size and it's far from fancy.  Service: 5 - I had no problem with the (one single) staff (member) I saw. He got a call, and seemed annoyed with whatever customer he was speaking with - rushing the person along because I happened to be standing there. At least he was both courteous to me and the person on the other end couldn't see him. Also, he gave me a free One-Liter of Mt. Dew I was not expecting. Cheers!  Food Taste: 5, oh, excellent!  Food Quality: 5, FRESH, wonderful. As if made in my own kitchen.  Cleanliness: 3 - it wasn't necessarily dirty, but it wasn't the Ritz either.  Friendly Staff: 5 - like I said, he was friendly with me, at least.  Fast Busing: N/A, didn't eat in.  Smoking Area: No, in case you just stand on the sidewalk outside. NO! not too close to the door. Duh.  Would I Return?: Is the Pope Catholic? He is, still, isn't he?  Would I Recommend?: Even to someone on a diet.  And to who?: Anyone within earshot, or at least someone within the Metro Phoenix area.  Additional Information: Check it. You won't regret it, if you're into deep dish Chicago pizza, that is. It's even good reheated, but not 100%...and that's not their fault I can only eat two slices and be as full as Rush Limbaugh at an all day Vegas buffet."}
{"text":"4stars only because of high prices excellent cheese and sauce quality. Deep dish thin crust or very great. Better than any fast chain pizza place hands down.  11-13-17 great stuff every time expensive for a pick up joint but best Chicago pizza deep dish."}
{"text":"Good thin crust pizza not greasy.  Very fast delivery but 2 topping, large, thin crust, delivered, $22.58. Maybe a bit high$ for 3 people."}
{"text":"my husband and I decided to give the deep fish a chance. it was delicious! we are from the Chicago suburbs and it was the closest thing to home we have had in a while!"}
{"text":"Still the best Chicago style in Phx! Better than all of the new ones. Sorry Malnarti's or whatever you new places are. For Chicago pizza this is the place. Both there thin and deep dish are best in town. Cheers JC"}
{"text":"Been looking for a really good pizza for awhile. Sardella's is good, but I'm kinda sick of it. It's also a bit of a drive from where I live. I've been told by others around that i need to try Vito's Pizza. I gave it a try this evening and ordered the \"Vito's Special\" deep dish pie. Wow!! Really good and really filling. Toppings are inverted so when you're through the mushrooms and peppers you still have this cheesy, chewy crust to enjoy. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Excellent Chicago style thin crust! Prices are great too! Worth a drive to go pick up!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this little place based on all your reviews. Place was pretty empty, hubby ordered their deep dish margarita pizza and it was 45 minute wait, which is fine since it advertises that in the menu. Drinks are a $2.50 which is too expensive for me. My husband asked if they sold beer and they do not but we were told we can bring our own, game changer! Pretty awesome! Went across the street bought our beer came back and still had 20 minutes to spare, lol. I ordered the thin crust and it was pretty good. Deep dish was also very tasteful. Going back to try their homemade sausage, since all the workers were raving about it. Beware fellow yelpers, small feed 3 comfortably."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Make sure you order in advanced because they make to order and if you don't live nearby you will be just waiting for 45 minutes. Husband especially loved it, would eat here again."}
{"text":"Wow............let me just say that this place reminds me of the neighborhood pizza places back home in the northeastern, USA.  Staff was cool and very attentive and nice. We ordered the deep dish Chicago style pizza. Not only was it huge, but it was very delicious.  Can't wait to go again.........and again............"}
{"text":"Called in an order on the way from work to home and asked for prices and when I go there one of the pizzas was different.   Ordered a large deep dish sausage and mushroom was quoted $26 and a medium margherita and was told $9 on the phone. When I got there they rang up the bill and said $47. I said how much were each pizza and was told $26 and  $17 and I said I was told $9 for the medium.   The 2 females there were pretty rude about the price discussion and I thought whatever.if this pizza does not wow me I will never come back mainly because of their attitude.   When I got the pizzas I lifted them and they must of weighed over 5 lbs. The deep dish is a monster of a pizza definitely weighing in over 5 lbs.  When I tried the deep dish sausage and mushroom it is prepared by putting the ingredients on first then the cheese and topped with the sauce covering everything. It makes the pizza very saucy. The pizza had little bits of sausage and a good amount of mushrooms. My opinion it was a little skimpy on the sausage which you could hardly taste any sausage.   My daughter really liked the thin crust margherita pizza and thought it was very good.   Some of the other reviews claimed this was the best deep dish in AZ and rivaled any Chicago Deep Dish Pizza was in my opinion very wrong.   First of all it is in my opinion not even the best in AZ let alone even be compared to any Chicago Deep Dish. My favorite deep dish pizza is Rosatis on Shea and Scottsdale Road (The other Rosatis are not as good). Thus pizza does not even compare to the Chicago Pizza of Lou Malnati's or Giordanos.  If you like quantity over quality and over priced thin crust pizza this is for you.  I think starting off with the price in question was a horrible first impression and the 2 females were terrible to deal with.  Overall was not impressed by the deep dish and will not come back because of the customer service.   Rosatis here I come."}
