{"text":"People, people, people! - you have GOT to go here :D  Atmosphere: literally a hole in the wall - if it weren't for a tip from my favourite Aunt - I wouldn't have known this place exists and I pass by often!  It's a no frills place - but you're not here for the decor - trust me!  Food: bonafide best Falafel I have had in Montreal and compares to that from Lebanon and other Levantine countries (to which I've been).  Hands down - the best! I was so enamoured by the taste I went back 3 times in 3 days! Fresh, crisp, and made into sandwiches the Lebanese way with cabbage salad and tomatoes :D  if you ask them - they can even make a special home-fries pita sandwich for you with mayo and hot-sauce! Those who know - know!  you can even buy the falafels to go and make your own sandwiches at home!!!  Service: Wonderful - these people (a family) are down to Earth and incredibly happy to be around clients.  They like what they do and it shows.  I wolfed down 3 sandwiches and chatted with each member of the team and they didn't skip a beat.  this is a great great find my friends - you'll really eat well here! I know I did.  W"}
{"text":"Their Falafel are ok but unfortunately served cold and nothing to write home about.  I suggest getting a falafel sandwich with just a bit of the following -don't let them put the usual amount-: -Parsley. -Tomatoes. -Pickled cucumber. -A bit of hot Sauce if you like. -Their Tahina -don't let them drown it regardless of how magical they tell you it is!-.  For added measure if you are doing take out, add 1-2 sliced boiled eggs at home. It actually adds a lot to the taste. If you want to go the extra mile, add a fried slice of eggplant but that's a bit hardcore and I'm surprised they aren't doing all this and calling it the REALLY crazy falafel or something.  Their burgers and versions of Chicken or beef shawerma isn't good, honestly. Their fries are a bit greasy and not good.  Surprisingly, their Taboolah, kebbah and rolled grape vines aren't bad."}

{"text":"Great falafels and good sandwiches. I reaaaaallly like their sesame sauce. Try their super falafel plate. Only dislike is that the fries are dripping with oil :s"}
{"text":"Love the food, low price for healty fast food for generous portions with vegatables they have always specials 2 for 1,...Customer service is great."}
{"text":"J'ai commandé un trio falafel pour 10$ et ce que j'ai préféré c'était mon crush orange...le pita falafel m'a nourrit mais le goût n'y était pas.. Les patates à l'ail Sont juste des frites enrobés d'une sauce industrielle et le tabouleh de mon ami était trop acide et noyé dans la vinaigrette... Déçue! J'ai l'impression d' avoir perdu de l'argent..."}
{"text":"After hearing good things about this place, I definitely have to say that leaving disappointed was an understatement. The falafel is possibly the worst I've ever had (and that's bad coming from an Arab...), and is COATED with massive layers of breading. Kind of defeats the purpose...Ugh, so disappointing. Otherwise, the halawa sandwich was good, and I have to say that the prices are decent....But I won't be coming back, that's for sure.."}
{"text":"The best falafel in Montreal. Friendly atmosphere with great prices. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"One of the best places to eat middle eastern sandwiches  Must try the Saroukh Sandwich, Soujoukh or nakanek  Rosto sandwich is also delicious  The have the best falafel in town  #1 Saroukh"}
{"text":"This is my to go for falafels, their falafels are delicious and cheap. Even though it's quite busy sometimes, the ladies are so nice and always serve you with a smile. Their falafel wraps and garlic fries are my favourites. Love the consistency and the taste. So delicious and filling :)  For the falafel entree, with taxes it comes up to$4 which is good for value. I'd always keep on going :) and recommend it to anyone who's craving for falafels and for their wallets not to cry. So happy"}
{"text":"I was in the area looking for a cheap yet filling and reasonably healthy vegetarian option. I hit a home run! $2 falafel, $2 hummus and pita as well as many more options for a very low price tag.  I had a falafel pita sandwich and hummus and pita, and both were excellent (as well as vegan). It was a very satisfying meal.  They also have fresh juice and some interesting options like spiced fries."}
{"text":"I seriously love this place. It's so cheap and so good. Service can be a bit slow, so it's not the best place if you're in a rush."}
{"text":"I was hungry looking for a fast option and this place was nearby. I had the Falafel which might not be asgoid as Fa Avenue but uts was surprisingly good. Much better then the ones at other falafel places since it is relatively fresh / mafe on the spot. The trio comes with a canned drink which I have no idea why you need to add 50cent for a non carbonated drink. If you do go there I recommend the Pataes A l'ail. Yes very oily but also good"}
