{"text":"Not too bad, not amazing though. Tried brisket (good), garlic mash (ok), pulled chicken (ok), beans (great). The food felt a little pricey for the quantity, and no sides included with the sandwiches. The wrap was around the \"snack size\" wrap size from McDonalds, so don't go for that if you are hungry. No BBQ sauce sitting around (sacrilege for a BBQ joint) although you could buy BBQ sauce if you wanted BBQ on your BBQ. Staff was friendly.  There aren't many options in that immediate area, and there are quite a few businesses/offices around so maybe they have a captive audience? Or maybe I've just been spoiled by years indulging in the pleasures of southern BBQ spots."}
{"text":"AMAZING!   Everything is great, especially the pulled pork, the food is always hot, fast, and delicious! I've had take out and dined in, the food is always up to par. The employees are always friendly and funny. Grab some napkins for a finger licking good time! I suggest this place to everyone I work with since they are right across the street; I've been begging our managers to have Hap's cater a lunch for us!   Seriously, enjoy!   PS. Honey Bears doesn't hold a candle to Hap's!  Only 4 stars because this restaurant should have later hours during the week, be open for more than 6 1/2 hours on Saturday, and just plain open on Sunday's. I get off work at 7 PM and would like to grab some Hap's for dinner but I can't because they close at 7."}
{"text":"I found this place while on a business trip to Phoenix.  Hungry for BBQ for lunch and tried their half slab ribs.  Probably one of the best ribs I've had, if not the best.  I have eaten BBQ in Kansas City, St Louis, Dallas, Houston etc and Haps is among the tops.  Ribs are huge, juicy, succulent, and tender goodness.  Their BBQ sauce is also very tasty with just the right tang and sweetness that does not overpower the meat.  I love this place so much, I came back again the next day.  This time I tried the chicken and ribs combo.  As expected, I devoured my meal.  There are a lot of options on the menu from pulled pork, rib tips, chicken, ham, etc.  The side dishes are truly delish as well.  I have tried the Cole slaw, potato salad, and garlic. buns.  Yummy but there's more to try.  Love this place.  Highly recommended.  You can't go wrong.  I just wish they open up a store in Southern California."}
{"text":"I eat here for lunch almost every single day. Just thinking about it makes me hungry. Is it lunch time yet?!"}
{"text":"I'm hard to please when it comes to barbecue, and I wasn't particularly impressed by the barbecue at Hap's.  Now, admittedly, I went out on a limb and tried somthing that was a risk--barbecue pulled lamb.  But I had the lamb in a combo with the barbecue pulled pork to ameliorate the risk.  I wasn't impressed with the pork, either.  The side dishes and choices of breads are much more interesting.  I had the garlic mashers and cornbread and both were solid and tasty choices.  The barbecue sauce was good, but nothing special.  I wouldn't want to start a barbecue war, but I'd recommend the nearby Honey Bear's over Hap's."}
{"text":"Bought a Tennessee style beef brisket.. well what can I say the only thing good about this place, it is clean and staff is friendly other than that my sandwich was cold and dry and had no flavor..im not much on complaining on food but yuck!!!"}
{"text":"I've tried several of the bbq joints in the valley and Haps by far is a cut above the others. Had the sampler the other day and it was awesome! Brisket was nice and tender, the ribs peeled right off the bone, the pulled pork melted in my mouth, the chicken was delicious, and the lamb left me wanting more. And, I don't even like lamb all that much. I chose baked beans for the side and they didn't disapoint. I will definitely go back to Haps for an encore."}
{"text":"When I first reviewed this place, I think I was at a loss for good southern BBQ.  Now that I've eaten at Haps a few times, I've noticed a few of the annoying things they do with their food. First, when you come to Haps, you never smell smoking meat, which makes me wonder if they smoke their own BBQ, or they buy it precooked from a distributor.  I've seen them use the microwave to heat their baked beans and their pulled pork, which makes me think they don't cook the BBQ in house.  Their food is certainly better than fast food, but maybe not as good as some other BBQ places in the Valley"}
{"text":"Every spring we spend two weeks in Phoenix for spring training.  Each year we go to Haps several times for a quick lunch.  We stick with the sandwiches - pulled pork, brisket, chicken, or ham.  They are all very good.  The sauce is excellent but they never give us enough so we order more.  My family loves the slaw (uhgg).  The other sides are OKayish but not on par with the BBQ. The best part is the hot peach cobbler for dessert.  The prices are adequate.  The location is near a lot of things or at least en-route.  The staff is efficient and friendly.   As for the BBQ:  The meat is smoked and cooked with a rub not in the sauce.  Some people like this but I prefer my BBQ to be cooked in or basted with the sauce.  The BBQ sauce is served more as a condiment/topping or dip.  The sauce is bold like a Texas BBQ with some hints of sweetness of KC style.  In short, we will go to Haps again and again.  We will and have recommended this eatery to family and close friends."}
{"text":"Perhaps with the exception of the lamb (which is really just a novelty anyway), everything is very well done - all the essentials (pulled pork, spare ribs, brisket) are cooked and served the way they should be.  Sauce is served warm and delicious, although no sauce is provided on the side.  I have not seen or tasted anything much better at BBQ competitions.   Only room for improvement is on the sides... cornbread is a little dry.  But when you want good BBQ'd meat, do you really trust someone that spent too much time baking?  Focus on what's important!  As a \"tip\" for getting great value, get the rib tips sandwich, served open face.  It is a very generous portion for the cost and the meat is surprising meaty and tender, considering this cut is really just a byproduct.  All sandwiches are served on a warm bun that is fresh and has perfect size and texture so to not distract from the meat and sauce.  I actually look forward to CPA seminars across the street (AZ Society of Certified Public Accountants) because of Haps."}
{"text":"One star for their great service. Food was the worst BBQ ever, horrible, ribs were rare?  Yes pink stuck to the bone not done, threw them away.   Expensive and horrible food."}
{"text":"So.. Being a BBQ Chef and all around BBQ snob, I thought I would check this place out.  I can at least say I've tried it.    Pulled pork: tasted like they just thawed it out after running to the grocery store and buying pre made.  Brisket: smoke ring?? Nothing.  Very dry.  Ribs: now the ribs I can get behind.  Very juicy and tender.  They didn't fall off the bone when you looked at them but they also didn't have to be tugged on by your teeth.    Take it or leave it, but this is just my opinion."}
{"text":"Burgers fantastic. Pulled pork sandwich was great. Quick service. Yelp wouldn't let me post unless the review was longer. Bla bla bla. Food is good."}
{"text":"Awesome food!! The lamb is amazing... so was the  ribs and brisket... I guess everything was amazing :)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I couldn't decided where to go eat. We ended up coming into Hap's. I didn't know what to order so I asked the guy talking orders what he recommended if I wanted to eat some brisket. He recommended the brisket sandwich with coleslaw. OMG I think I inhaled the sandwich when I got it. Staff was friendly, place is clean and really neat with the drawings on the walls. Price is fair. I recommend this place and I will definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"Cheap and awesome.  Pulled pork is the way to go.  No Kool Aid, missed on that one.  Overall one of the best lunch spots in the area"}
{"text":"I have only been to Haps once so this review is for the pulled pork sandwich.  I give the sandwich 3.75 stars. The pork was tender and the sauce had the right sweet and tangy flavor. It is not best of the best I have tried. I do see myself as a repeat customer if I'm ever back in this area."}
{"text":"Just happened to be in the neighborhood when we saw this BBQ place.  The pulled pork and beef did not disappoint.  The sandwiches can be called 'hardy' portions on large buns.  The sauce was excellent.  The place is very clean.  Very good service.  Was not impressed with the coleslaw - seemed flat.  Will return as the high ratings of this establishment are well deserved."}
{"text":"I have to admit, my first to this restaurant was nothing special, but I think I just ordered the wrong thing. It was so unforgettable, I forgot what I ordered.  The sampler plate, however, is the way to go. Chicken, ribs, and your choice of three other meats for $12.99. I chose hot links, lamb, and brisket. Wow! A VERY generous portion of all the meats and they were all awesome. Especially the lamb. It came with a little thing of mint sauce for the lamb, which once you get used to, is actually pretty tasty.   I still think I prefer Honey Bear's beans, but Haps' beans are far from inferior. It's really just a matter of taste.  All in all it was a great meal. Service is just ok... Every time I've been there, it seems like they have no patience for people staring at the menu deciding what to order even when the place is empty."}
{"text":"Came here for the second time, last time was years ago. It was what I remember it to be. Not too busy but everyone was nice. Ribs were very good! The sauce is good but they need to give you more. The brisket sandwich has great flavor. Corn bread was re heated and average or so."}
{"text":"Always see this place on the way home. Finally stopped in. Being from the south, I need my barbecue. Ordered the Pulled Pork Sandwich. Pretty good. Sauce was good. Next time it'll be the ribs. Check them out if you already haven't."}
{"text":"Amazing mashed potatoes!! I got the tub o' tips and let me tell you the ribs were amazing!! Smells good taste better!!"}
{"text":"I was raised on Texas pit bbq, so that's what I'm accustomed to and what I prefer.  My first trip to Hap's was so-so.  I ordered a brisket sammie, potato salad, old settler beans, peach cobbler and an iced tea.  That all totaled $17 and change which is a bit steep.  Brisket sammie - overall it was pretty good.  Bun was fresh.  Difficult to taste the meat alone since it was drenched in sauce.    Potato salad - nothing to write home about.  One of the least favorite potato salads I've had.  Old Settler Beans - THIS is what the Hatfields & McCoy's have been fighting over for decades.  These were the best cowboy beans I've had in a pit joint.  It's likely due to the bacon and leftover beef they thrown into the mix.  Great spicy & smoky flavor.  Peach cobbler - not too bad.  I got my meal \"to go\" so I didn't get it ala mode.  All in all - not a bad experience.  I'll revise my rating after I try the other meats - chicken, pulled pork, hot link & ribs."}
{"text":"Corn bread was delicious! Bbq sauce tasted great. Wish it was closer."}
{"text":"I had the lamb special BBQ sandwich - it was good: moist - tasty. Just a perfect lunch sandwich.  The place is small but very clean, and looks well cared for.  Definitely will be back on my nxt phx trip."}
{"text":"I eat haps like every week You really can to go wrg with anything on the menu I still need try the turkey and ham and lamb  But I've tried everything else on the menu It's a must have for sure"}
{"text":"Great BBQ with standout brisket. The pork ribs are just like a great date: lightly sauced, tender and juicy. Well worth a visit."}
{"text":"I am a fan of the prime rib brisket they serve on occasion.  Yes, it is expense but it is so good...just hand them your card and enjoy.  I like that you can get weight from the lean and fat end.  It comes with plenty of sauce.  I also had the garlic mash potatoes.  I mixed a little of the sauce in with the potatoes and had to order another.  This is not the best BBQ I've ever eaten but it is good.  Looking for a \"I'm starving and need something to travel with\" get the Hot Links dog style.  They come on a bun with a small caplet of onions and BBQ sauce.  Get the sauce on the side to avoid the saggy bun syndrome.  There is usually a long wait during the lunch rush...so call ahead or come after the rush is over."}
{"text":"Hap's catered our office Halloween party for the 2nd year in a row.  Everything was hot when it arrived.  The meats were all tender and delicious.  The cobbler was a big hit.  From the Beef Brisket, Pulled Pork, Cole Slaw, Corn Bread and Broccoli Cheese casserole - everything was on point and taste of perfection!  Thank you Thank you!  We look forward to visiting you often and asking you to cater many more office events.  ~ T-Systems Tempe"}
{"text":"A small family-run type of restaurant; friendly service, good food, and speedy. I like their BBQ sauce and they have a great lunch special...it's about $7 and you can get a pulled BBQ sandwich with your choice of meat, garlic mashers (yummy, chunky garlic mashed potatoes), a bag of chips, and a drink. Great deal. I usually order an extra side of sauce otherwise I find it a little on the drier side...I like my BBQ sandwiches soaked. Yum! Good food and a good place to go for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch today for the first time.  There is plenty of parking, and you get a whiff of a little piece of bbq heaven when you set foot inside.  I opted for the pulled pork sandwich, which I thought was decent.  I thought it could have had more bbq sauce.  There was hardly any, so it was a little bland to me.  The line moved fast (the food came out fast also), and the service was good.  If you are looking for a decent, quiet place for lunch, give this place a shot.  Just ask for extra bbq sauce."}
{"text":"Every time I'm in the area I always come to this place. The BBQ brisket sandwich is very good and the pulled pork sandwich. I think next time I'll get to Tennessee style and that with the coleslaw on the sandwich very good."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with the sauce. And the beef seemed real greasy. Im use to sliced beef instead of shredded. Corn bread fell apart into a million crumbs when I took it out of the wrapper. I just wasnt impressed at all. The people were friendly and was a clean facility."}
{"text":"The pulled pork is ok. The ribs are crap. The sauce is good but very sweet. The soda is watered down. But the biggest problem is that it is waaaaaayyyyyyy overpriced. With so many good BBQ options around the valley this is a place you should skip."}
{"text":"Terrible & WAY over priced!  I had the pulled pork sandwich with slaw & garlic bread for a side.  The pork was ok by its self for smoked pork. As a pulled pork sandwich though, it was awful. The bbq sauce they put on it was store bought. The pork was dry & not well separated. The bun was SO bad. It was hard & tasted dry even with sauce.   The \"garlic \"\"bread\"\" was a cheap hamburger bun slathered in cheap garlic butter, then burned on one side which got soggy in the foil wrapper they serve it in. I would have got my money back on it, but I had a couple bites & just left.   The tables were dirty too."}
{"text":"Well, if BBQ stands for Bad Bad Que...this is the place.  Ok...so a little harsh but since it is pretty darn close to the best BBQ place ever (little miss BBQ) it is hard not to compare.  Anyway...brisket sandwich was ok.  A bit oily....bottom bun was saturated with grease.  Cornbread literally fell apart into pieces after taking out if wrap.    Disappointing trip.  Will stick to the local joints that never disappoint."}
{"text":"Excellent smoked meats here.  The place is super busy and popular, but wait times are reasonable.  This place came highly recommended to me by a friend who lives local and it definitely lived up to its reputation.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I just stopped by Hap's to pick up some ribs and chicken for the first NFL game of the year. I have eaten here once before and forgot the great smoked taste that all of their meats have.   I would compare it to something like a Shane's Barbecue, not really a hole in the wall type barbecue spot but definitely small and very clean. I think the meat has a much better taste than Shane's, more of a smoked taste rather than relying on the sauce for the taste.   I would say this is more of a pick-up type place and for sure a place to get some family sized meals for a small party or during a game."}
{"text":"Good service bbq was tastee. Overall happy!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Haps for a couple of years now.  I will say the food is always really good.  I had the pulled pork sandwhich and it was good.  I got a side of mashed potatoes and they were yummy.  The ribs were okay this trip.   This place is really good."}
{"text":"Hap's BBQ offers the strongest bbq experience in Phoenix; love the ribs, brisket, sauce, corn bread & most everything else on their menu.   Visit soon, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great prices for the quality products they offer. I had ribs (fall off the bone meaty goodness), wife had a pulled chicken sandwich (juicy and good flavor) and kids had pulled pork (no fat, just melt in your mouth tender meat).  Low key, easy place to grab a great BBQ experience."}
{"text":"The food here is okay, not great. I had a brisket plate with baked beans and a drink that totaled just shy of $17.00. The service was decent.  Not slow, but certainly not fast. The barbecue sauce was good, but the meat was really fatty and not very flavorful. There was no bark to speak of on the brisket. Next time I'm in the area, I may HAPpen to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Hap's is in an area of town that doesn't have that many healthy lunch options.  I get the 1/4 Chicken Only (No Sides) 2 Piece-White (Breast and Wing.) Sauce on the side.  The breast is a nice piece of smoked meat that they put on the grill for a minute to heat up when served.  Discard the skin and enjoy only the end chunk off the wing and you've got a pretty good high-protein lunch for under $4 for the paleo-diet oriented crowd."}
{"text":"Good, solid bbq! Looked up this place online as it is close to my hotel. Didn't have a car so made the 1 mile walk on over in the desert heat. I arrived sweating feverishly, but was quickly cooled off by the pleasant  staff. The guy at the counter was super nice and made me feel right at home there. I wasn't sure what kind of sandwich to order and he suggested the beef brisket. It was awesome! Tender, juicy cuts of brisket with a perfectly balanced bbq sauce on a soft bun. I know this may seem odd to comment on the Coke I had, but even it was just right... I hate when on a hot day I grab a cup to get some coke from the coke dispenser and it's not fresh. The pop here was nice and bubbly just like I like it.   Prices were extremely reasonable, staff was friendly, & food was fast and fresh (and so was the coke)."}
{"text":"Great food and service! Introduced me to putting coleslaw on a BBQ sandwich (highly recommend it). Food comes out to the table within minutes. Brisket can't be beat, plenty of desserts, and also a good option for takeout (many people choose this option so usually there's plenty of seating inside despite the smaller location)."}
{"text":"Was getting a car smogged and found this place using Yelp. When I first moved here, this BBQ place was Honey Bears, but I guess they left years ago. Now, although I have no idea how long it has been here, but Hap's is certainly a good BBQ joint. The cook or owner said it was St. Louis style, but Baltimore is actually more famous for their pit bbq as well. The only two things we tried were sliced brisket ($8) and chopped brisket and both were Tennessee style topped with coleslaw for 99 cents extra. The sandwiches do not come with a side as normal. My chopped brisket was great as it had no fat at all and house bbq sauce was light and pleasant. The slaw was a vinegary mix and finely chopped, so it added a great crunch. You can order the sliced brisket fatty or lean and that also was well enjoyed. The place is kinda in the semi-hood, but most great bbq joints in the USA are also located in shady areas, so go check it out."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in the Phoenix Metro hands down.  Forget Honey Bears, Joe's, The Pits Again, and throw Famous Dave's out the window also.  If you are looking for great BBQ Hap's is it.  There are several reason's to love Hap's.  But the only reason to love a BBQ joint is because of their meat.  Not only does Hap's have the traditional beef, pork, and chicken, but they also have some odder choices as well like lamb, and ham (some places have ham but most don't).  Hap's uses a combo of pecan and green mesquite wood for smoking (I don't know anyone that uses green mesquite).  This combo gives the meat a really rich smoke flavor but does not hide the taste of the meat.  This rich taste also insures that you don't need to use sauce on your meal (Thank God for wood and fire).  The sides at Hap's are a good compliment as well.  Garlic mashes, bean medily, and fresh made potato salad are some of the best.  If you are a rib fan then Hap's is your place.  They don't serve babys but spares are my favorite anyway and Hap's brisket and pulled pork are very flavorful as well.  If you are wanting BBQ in Phoenix Metro Hap's is your place.  They only have one location so it gets real busy during the lunch hour.  I would suggest to call ahead and have your meal waiting for pickup."}
{"text":"And I don't even like BBQ. Well, that's not totally true, every once in a blue moon a nice pulled pork sandwich sounds good. But I generally find it to be vinegary and sometimes sugary (which I can't fathom for the life of me) and sort of sour and just weird. Usually I only eat it when forced to: at a friend's for dinner or the co-workers want to go out for BBQ for lunch. The latter being the reason I ended up here recently. We had actually attempted to lunch at the nearby indoor go kart race track, which has a café, but they don't serve until 1p. So we hit up the cramped mini strip mall of some of the only food for miles in this business park area I refer to as the \"no man's land\" when it comes to food.  I eyed the pulled pork sandwich on the menu, but decided to be adventurous (a risk when you don't really like BBQ) and went for the beef brisket wrapped in a tortilla. I added cheddar cheese (I mean go heart attack or go home, right?) to the wrap and got a drink and a side of garlic mashed potatoes for about $7.  It was rather busy in the small place on a Friday, so we had to sit at the bar style seating which means you stare at a wall - at least make the view out the window, I say. It was awkward seating for our party of two, so don't stumble in with 4-5 co-workers on a Friday and expect to all sit together unless you're lucky and get a small booth.  About 3-5 minutes later they called our orders. Pretty quick for how busy they were, and totally fine if you're running in and taking it to go. And damnit if that tortilla wasn't flavorful and amazing, and the brisket inside?! Fantastic. I was really, really impressed. Oh, it was greasy as hell (it dripped out the bottom and all over my hands) but very good. And VERY rich. I liked it so much I went back about two weeks later to get the same, and this time gobbled it up fast and felt ill after. So if you don't have an iron stomach take your time on this one. The mashed potatoes were a good size and also very tastey. All in all, I was very impressed with this fast food spot. For the money I got measurably better food than I would have imagined. Plus quick and friendly service makes four stars. Done and done."}
{"text":"Their brisket is the best ive ever had. Ribs were great. Links were good but nothing special. Beans w beef n bacon good. Broccoli cheese casserole good. Cornbread a bit dry. Service great. Quick."}
{"text":"Oh Hap's....you bait us in with the wonderful smells of barbecue and promise of a plate full of dead roasted animal and as soon as I open the door all I get I dissapointment.  Now don't get me wrong the food is pretty good but it just felt like I walked into a McDonald's.  It doesn't feel like a BBQ place.  That aside I still had hope because all I could smell is cooking meat and I saw the plates coming out of the kitchen.  Then I looked up at the menu and ordered the sampler plate.  Again the food was OK but the prices for what you actually get is less than great and for the first time ever I left a BBQ restaurant hungry.  The staff was very friendly and the whole place was very clean, sterile almost.  But when you sit down for this type of meal you want a little more rustic feel to the place and to the food."}
{"text":"This was my first time going to Hap and my last time. Although the food was not terrible it was cold and was extremely overpriced for the quality and quantity that you receive. With Honeybears down the street I don't think it can compete for my business. The only upside to it was I felt it was very clean where honeybears can be questionable."}
{"text":"The worst BBQ I've ever tasted. I had the beef brisket dinner, garlic mashers and chips. The mash potatoes had a funky taste and I ate two bites. The brisket was extremely greasy and the sauce had no flavor. The best part of the meal was the chips. All for $11.79 including tax. Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Had the brisket sandwich and potato salad. It was good. For some reason they don't serve your food with a tray. That was a little strange. They young lady behind the counter took my order and the gentlemen who made it delivered it to me. He handed me my a stack of items which was my sandwich, a container of potato salad,  and a fork. I was a little suprised there wasn't a tray or bag.   The other thing that was a little off is the tipping system when paying with a credit card. They turn the screen for you to fill out a receipt. She suggested for me to make any changes  (aka: add a tip if I wanted). The screen let's me choose what I want to do, it was just strange to me.  And yes  I did tip. I hope it's shared with the guy who made and handed me my food.  The brisket was chopped and covered in sauce. I'm not always a fan of brisket done like this. Sauce tends to cover up the taste of the beef. I found no bark to speak of so I assume it was a whole smoke brisket. The sauce was good but a lot of times I tend to skip it. I wish they would ask if you want it with or without sauce.  All in all it was an ok experience and I would go back."}
{"text":"I'm not a BBQ snob, I'm not from the South, I don't know what things are called when you add coleslaw to them, I don't have a pit in my backyard.  Yet, my love affair with pork runs deep, to the bone, kinda like how I love my grandma but pork isn't racist, so it's almost MORE pure.  I've even been known to cook pork myself, braise it, slow cook it, dance with it.   Hap's pulled pork sandwiches are god damn awesome, I don't care what anyone says.  The pork is perrrfectly cooked, tasty, mounted on some nondescript buns and served in easy-to-open foil inside a brown paper bag of wonderful.  I've never eaten anything else here, and I probably never will.   I also like the quaint atmosphere and how it's always busy enough at lunch time for you to know it's good, but not so busy that it takes an hour to get in and out of there.  Another thing I like about Hap's is that they take down you first name and call it out when your food is ready.  This may seem menial, but it adds a bit of personability to a place which I always can appreciate.  My co-workers have gotten the pulled chicken and beef and all that other stuff and they too share my love for this great lunch time spot.  The only negative I will say about Hap's is that every time I eat it I want to take a nap right after; which isn't so bad considering I have a job in which sleeping could be considered MORE productive."}
{"text":"Hap's is nothing to write home about. It's only busy at lunch because it's in the parking lot of a corporate building which is convenient to the employees. I ate there a couple years ago and decided to try it again recently. The pulled pork was dry and hard to chew. The bbq sauce is okay. Potato salad isn't bad...but there are much better choices of bbq in the area if you want better food quality. I wouldn't go there again."}
{"text":"A fast paced, fast food BBQ joint. Pretty good Que at reasonable prices. Service was fast. Not alot of seating be prepared to take it to go if there arent seats."}
{"text":"Since my previous review last year, I've eaten at Haps quite a few more times.  After lunch today (a coworker insisted we go there), I think it's finally time to reduce this to one star.  Why?  Well, in short, it's because they cut every corner they can find.  I've already mentioned the terrible side dishes.  The flavorless mashed potatoes, the garlic-less garlic toast, etc.  The buns they use are terrible; it's dry, spongy, and completely flavorless.  The scoop of ice cream they put on top of the cobbler (which they charge you about $1.50 for) is that yellow garbage you get in those five gallon buckets labeled \"frozen dairy dessert product.\"  And perhaps most indicative of their overall cheapness, they replaced the Henry Weinhard's root beer with that plastic bottled A&W crap some time last year.  Yes, I can tell the difference, and yes, that move alone cost them my business.  For the record, my lunch today (a pulled pork sandwich, a cup of cobbler with a scoop of ice cream, and a cup of water) cost me almost $12.  With a drink, that would have been $14.  For low quality food, those prices are unacceptable.  I guess people in Arizona like this garbage.  If someone tells you this place has good food, you can rest assured they either have no taste buds or actually like bad food."}
{"text":"I had hopes for this place... But the bun for my sandwich bread was stale, there was no sauce & my husbands cornbread was so dry. Too expensive for the amount of food we got. On the plus side, they were fast & the beans were good."}
{"text":"Lunch at Hap's Pit Barbecue today with wife and son-in-law. We arrived at 11 and it was half full.   My wife ordered the pulled pork sandwich and potato salad, our guest ordered the BBQ chicken and ribs with mashed potatoes and a soda and I ordered the chopped brisket, rib tips, potato salad, corn bread and soda. It came to $37.29. Not bad for BBQ.   The pulled pork here is consistently good. Moist, good flavor, not much smoke though. The chicken was good. The ribs and rib tips were pretty bad: tough, not much flavor and dry. The brisket was excellent with a juicy, flavorful pile of meat.   The sides were meh. I'll probably order meat by the pound next time."}
{"text":"great bbq best in the area !!! I had the Lamb it was outstanding ..."}
{"text":"Went to Haps for lunch today. I walk up to the register and the lady just stares at me and kind of looks annoyed. No hello. Or can I help you? Maybe even a  what would you like to eat today? None of the above. I ordered pulled pork, garlic mashers and a drink. Over eleven dollars, pretty high prices for the little I got. After I paid I did not even get a thank you, she pretty much still had her unwelcoming look. Pretty pathetic. Even more pathetic is the tip jar this woman had in front of the register. I ordered my food from the register then got up to get my food that was sitting on the counter getting cold. Cant believe she did not walk it over to me or at least let me know it was ready. Why do you think you deserve a tip after your horrible customer service? I get better service at Whataburger. They greet you, thank you and deliver the food to you. They also don't have a tip cup out begging for money.  The pulled pork was lacking sauce so I ask for more and was maybe given one ounce in a small plastic container. I sat in Haps for about 30 minutes. Only one person came in. You would think with so little customers coming in they would be more welcoming. Next time I want bbq I will go to Costco. Better pork, less expensive and they know how to say hello and thank you. Haps management if you care, the employee who was lacking the customer service skills was the spanish speaking lady."}
{"text":"Ok, BBQ sauce was not great.  Slaw was good with the chopped beef."}
{"text":"Three star's is being generous food just was not that good for the price. Workers were nice that is about all."}
{"text":"Best Ribs in Phoenix hands down. Go for the food, the atmosphere and service are nothing special. Better yet get it takeout.  Been here several times and the Ribs and rib tips have to be my overwhelming favorite and defiantly the best Ive found in Phoenix. A close second is the Pit Ham, its easily the best Ive found as well. The pulled port and beef are also excellent but you can find better places for those.   The biggest downside is that this place is always packed, the interior is more like a subway and less like a restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been there a few times, and it's good enough to keep coming back. The BBQ lamb is fairly unique, and has a very nice taste to it. The sandwiches come on a bakery-style bun, as opposed to the super cheap hamburger buns you see at most fast-food BBQ places. Not gourmet, but noticeably better.  The garlic mashed potatoes were surprisingly good. Again, not gourmet, but for just over a buck, a nice addition to the sandwich.  There are still quite a few things on the menu I need to try, and I'm looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Second time here. Delicious as always. Authentic tasting barbecue and the sides are amazing. Will definitely return although it is not the healthiest food to eat! Just the right amount of sauce and they put it on the side so you can use as you wish with the perfect tang BBQ is supposed to taste like. Hands down best BBQ I've found in Phoenix yet. Pulled pork and beef brisket melt in your mouth and mashed potatoes taste like home."}
{"text":"Good quick stop, their garlic mashed potatoes are amazing and their menu items are reasonably priced. Pulled pork with brisket sandwich is my favorite, sauce is a tad sweet for my liking, but flavorful. Would rather come here than HB's any day!"}
{"text":"Having only a short window for lunch during a training session I decided to try hap's in Phoenix. While the service and establishment are bright and open, the special smoked chicken salad was so so. A mixture of field greens and minimal tomatoes and raisins left much to be desired. The chicken itself was a little bland but I did refuse the side of bbq sauce.   The salad did arrive quickly allowing enough time to eat and return to class."}
{"text":"I work for the airlines and love barbecue so Haps is the \"only\" place. Honey Bears is a joke and quite simply their is no great barbecue in the entire valley. Period!   Anyone who thinks otherwise is not very well traveled.  The four star rating I give Haps is based on the Arizona \"handicap\" scale. Their biggest problem is the meat inconsistency, from day to day they can easily slide to 3 ... and lord help me ... 2 Arizona stars.   I don't know who manages this joint but ... Dude!  So why am I a regular at Haps, well I love barbecue and have learned to navigate the mine fields. Luckily the sauce is always consistent and if push comes to shove you can always drown the poor beast. However on the occasional excellent day, no sauce is required. Go figure!   The most consistent meat is the Ribs, the really safe bet is to buy the ribs individually, they tend to use the best center cuts. The beans are always excellent and the garlic mashers are the other stand out.  The rest of the sides are downright embarrassing, in fact the lack of imagination is appalling. Once again ... Dude!  Haps really needs a proper master smoker who can bring back meat consistency and dream up some edible sides. Then they would really deserve a proper 4 star rating.   Until then ... IT IS WHAT IT IS!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service experience eith HAPS!  I placed catering order for my 85 employees as part of our staff appreciation week. The \"manager\" delivered order and was rude to the front office staff.  After setting up the food, I noticed that there were ribs which I did not order and I told the manager three separate times.  He still left and did not take the ribs.  We start serving our staff only for hin TO come back 15 minutes later IN THE MIDDLE of our serving line to TAKE THE RIBS THAT WE HAD OPENED AND WAS SERVING!!!!  Called and complained to the owner Julian and although he gave an insincere apology, he actually saw nothing wrong with the what the manager did!!!!!!  Never will get my patronage again!!!  Hope they didn't REUSE OR SELL THOSE RIBS to anyone else!!!"}
{"text":"I found this place in a trailer near downtown Phx 12 years ago-- then they were in the Great AZ BBQ cook off and  I loved their ribs--  been looking for them for years an just found them today--  the rib tips and the ribs are still fantastic  -- they are close to the airport in a real location go try them"}
{"text":"This place is bomb. Every bite was juicy, meaty goodness. I'm usually really picky about my bbq, but I must say that I have not one issue with what I had from Hap's today. I will DEFINITELY be returning."}
{"text":"Originally visited wanting sliced brisket, and at that time all they had was chopped. The chopped was good, but being from Texas, sliced is my preference. I had not gone back for a while, was nearby and decided to give it another try. Very pleased they now have sliced brisket.   The staff is friendly, the place is nice and clean, and the bbq is great.   Now it will become one of my regular bbq spots, and as a bonus you don't have to wait in line for an hour to get some great smoked sliced beef."}
{"text":"Hap's is a happening bbq place. The pulled pork sandwich is OMGosh darn great! The smoked chicken salad is, I crave it, good. Some day I'll try something else but I just love the pulled pork sandwich or the smoked chicken salad. Hap's is always way busy at lunch time. You order at the counter and pick up your food yourself. The employees are very accomodating and polite.You'll understand once you give them a try. Parking is a bit of a problem but there is street parking as well. It's a bit of a drive for me, but well worth the drive. It is close to GateWay Community College and Sky Harbor airport. They offer a catering service which is a plus in my book."}
{"text":"Average Fare  A lunch companion I decided to give Hap's Pit BBQ a try. To be honest I'm not a huge fan of barbecue and I found Hap's Pit Barbecue to be just kind of average.   On this visit I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and my lunch companions ordered the barbecue chicken salad, cornbread, chopped brisket, and chopped ham.   My lunch companion said that the chopped brisket was excellent and the ham and bbq chicken salad  were just so-so.  However, the cornbread was dry.  The service was slow, really slow, with just one person at the cash register and one person cooking. It took some time to place our order and some time to receive our orders. All in all an average lunch."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a co-worker.  We both had the combo sandwiches (half pulled pork, half pulled chicken)  I like the potato salad as the spices in it were good.  My co-worker enjoyed the broccoli casserole.  Good portions at a fair price."}
{"text":"This place sucks. I have been here 3 times and ive actually only ate there once. The first time, I got an overpriced sandwich. The second time I ordered a meal that was a special, and they mispriced it; so I asked for a refund. Just now I went in and got something that was on their menu for $6.89, but was charged $7.39 because apparently \"beef brisket\" as stated on their menu does not mean \"sliced\" beef brisket. I asked for a refund and got an attitude. Fact is - these people flat out lie about their prices assuming you wont look at your receipt. Bunch of con artist, so I will keep my money and go to a more ethical place for lunch where I pay what the price says on the menu."}
{"text":"So disgusted by the female owner. Went in today to pick up lunch for work and I see her just looking at a black man with a disgusted look and then tells the cashier she's nervous! Lady your everything wrong with America. She tries to give me some excuse about someone being shot by a black man... Really lady so are all white people the same as well? Good grief if your scared go home! By the way I don't like the fact your eating in the area that was prepping the food not very clean! As for the food the pulled pork sandwich was dry and nasty the pulled chicken with coleslaw was ok. Needless to say I won't be back ever!!!"}
{"text":"So far I have had their beef brisket and their pulled pork.  They pack some flavor for sure! Reasonable price, just wish the sides didn't cost so much, but I am a frugal guy at heart.  Good Q!"}
{"text":"Was driving by after a trip to the Post Office, across the street. Wasn't feeling well, was hungry so I took a break. First time here after looking at reviews. Had pulled pork, \"Tennessee-style\", no bun. Was okay. Their beans were good. I'd come back if I was in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Been enjoying the BBQ here for a long time.  Still a favorite and had lunch here twice in the last week!"}
{"text":"Got the combo plate. Pulled pork and chopped brisket. Awesome!!  Cornbread wasn't bad.  Not the best I've ever had but definitely not the worst.  The potato salad was good!  The meat though!!! Top notch. No need for sauce, but their bbq is pretty dang good!   My new lunch place for sure."}
{"text":"I love Hap's! Everyone there is super nice, the food is always on point! The Broc and cheese casserole is AMAZING!!! And the Beef brisket Tennessee style, O M G!!!!  I made a video to express how I feel: https://www.facebook.com/kimpossiblesanders/videos/888009347946818/?l=6445686274175138209"}
{"text":"Great bbq - would recommend to anyone wanting a cheap meal. Hosted me and my 3 friends!"}
{"text":"Because I was running late I left work without eating lunch.  Yelp on my iPhone pointed out Haps as being an excellent place to eat on my way to I-17.  Food is awesome.  Everything I had, (sampler) ranging from smoked chicken, ribs, pulled pork and brisket was really, really awesome.  And not that I'm into it but the sampler plate (to go) must have weighed 5 pounds.  No way I could finish.  One of those little hidden gems that you have to go find.  HIghly recommend and will gladly go back again."}
{"text":"Haps is a nice low key place that is very good for carry out and casual sit in no thrills restaurant.  I live in Scottsdale I make the drive once a month for a full rack of Haps delicious pork spare ribs.  Cannot find a place in Scottsdale that has better pork spare ribs.  The potato salad is very good as well.  I do not exaggerate this place makes tender almost fall off the bone spare ribs.  My Wife actually marks a date on our refrigerator calendar for when we are having their ribs.  Worth the 20 minute drive."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken n ribs dinner. At first glance it looked really good. I picked up a rib. The meat easily fell off the bone mmmm.. mmm.. \"I am going to devour this!\" First bite in to the ribs... the texture was really good. Just right. The flavor though... well not as good as it looks. I chose coleslaw and garlic toast. Coleslaw was... \"meh\"... Toast were hamburger buns... \"come on guys!\" hamburger buns?! Overall experience was just ok. The chicken was also ok."}
{"text":"HOLY SHAROLEE!!!  My co-worker and best friend suggested that we run down to Haps for a quick bite and to get out of the office for a bit.  Even though I brought lunch I was down for the escape.   We get there and right when we get to the register in this little case they have like four different kinds of what looks to be cobblers.  They have a peach one.  A PEACH ONE!!  I was so stoked.  Peach is my favorite.  I ordered the special that they had on the sandwich board outside.  Hot ham and cheese.  A large drink and the peach cobbler.  The cashier immediately asks me if I want ice cream to go with it.  I decided no because it might melt before it would be of any use to my cobbler.  The employee that was going to make our sammiches is behind the counter and I see her go grab a peach cobbler and pop it into the microwave.  WOW its gonna be warm oooey goodness.  Fill my drink the large is  L A R G E two hands needed.  I get done and our sammiches are ready.  Quick, quick, quick!   We get back to the office and I dive into the peach.  Oh my goodness.  It was/is so good.  It was yummy.  I thought about sharing with my friend but decided against it.  Too good.  The sandwich was good.  I liked it and the price wasn't bad."}
{"text":"I own a few smokers, and have put some time into the art of cooking meat low and slow over the years;  here's my take.    With all the BBQ options you have across the valley, this place doesn't do a half bad job.  It's also not the best in the valley.     BBQ is all about breaking down fat slowly till it mixes in with the meat to make a delicious flavor.  I'm pretty sure this place subscribes to a faster method.  They cover it with sauce and you can... just.... tell.     Real BBQ'd Meat doesn't lie.     I've eaten here 3 or 4 times and while not bad, it's not gonna blow your mind either.      Give it a try."}
{"text":"i gave hap's a 4 star because their ribs are damn good.  i have ordered the same item during lunch time.  so my review may not included all that hap's has to offer.  i ordered a ribs & chicken combo with 1 side and a drink for $12.  kinda pricey for a lunch but i figured if the meat taste great then it's worth the cost.  well, the ribs and chicken taste great and my coleslaw was just okay.  the day we went it was busy and seating was a little hard to find.  but other lunch days we are the only ones inside.  nice look inside the restaurant.  all in all, not a bad place for some above average ribs and if you are living large and want some ribs on the spot check out hap's pit bbq."}
{"text":"1/3lb burger was the size of a regular McDonald's burger. Waste. Regular burger with BBQ slapped on it. As much as I've heard about this place, I am extremely disappointed. Maybe their other dishes will be a lot better than this puny burger. For now, I am still not happy with the BBQ and Soulfood restaurant choices in Phoenix. So far, the best thing going out here is Papa Joe's  hands down. The peach cobbler is $2 and change. Hap's dry looking Betty Crocker cobbler was almost $5. WHAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NO! Now to finish, I just tasted the burger. Cheap grissle ridden ground beef with zero flavor on a discount Walmart bun. I need some free food to make up for this tragedy..."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the best BBQ places I've been to in a very long time. I would highly recommend this to anybody nearby just going to lunch or anybody in the area for dinner. And if you're not in the area it's worth the drive"}
{"text":"Love this place! I've searched out good BBQ in Phoenix and I have finally found a great \"lunch spot.\" I've also had the catering a couple times and it is also great.   Good prices, the line (every day at lunch!) moves fast... and you can eat outside almost every day.   I always get the Brisket Sandwich \"meal\" but my friends tell me the Pulled Pork is better... I guess it's all good!"}
{"text":"Okay, so Kevin and I initially wanted to go to Samauri Sams next door, but they closed at 5 (seriously??), so we checked out Yelp reviews for this place and decided to give it a go. The atmosphere was... interesting. Very loud mural on the wall of a cartoon pig cooking meat, with innuendos littered all over the place (see photos other reviewers have left). It is a very clean establishment, and the staff was super welcoming and friendly. I am not a huge fan of barbecue, but my pulled pork sandwich was amazing, as well as the warm cornbread I got on the side. Kevin got something similar with some spicy sausage or something. I didn't care for his, mostly because I don't like spicy things, but he enjoyed it. I think the food and the staff is worth between 4 and 5 stars, but OMG the music. Nothing but really lame jazz and 90's soul music. Each song was progressively worse than the last, and I kid you not - Brian McKnight came on and I just about lost it. The music did not match the atmosphere and killed the vibe for us, although we had a few giggles and fully enjoyed being there anyway. Would I go again? Yes. Would I most likely strangle the person in charge of music next time? You can count on it."}
{"text":"This place has the best beef brisket sandwich.  It was very good tasty and loaded with meat.  I did not have any sides, but next time I will try coleslaw."}
{"text":"Not was I was hoping for.  Tried the pulled pork sandwich,  rib tips,  and potato salad.  Everything was swimming  in an overly sweet sauce.  Pulled pork was soggy and I couldn't even tell if it had a smokey flavor because of the sauce. I won't comment too much on the rib tips because I'd never had rib  tips before,  so not much to compare it to. I will say that they were basically in sauce soup. Potato salad was tasty but nothing special  really  (not that it has to be).   My biggest qualm was the rudeness of the woman working the counter.  If you can manage a fake smile you shouldn't be in a customer service job. I literally sat at the counter and just started at her waiting for her to acknowledge me verbally, rather than just starting impatiently at me. The guy who ran the food was nice, but that lady is a nightmare of a person."}
{"text":"Hap's hooked us up at our place of business with some great BBQ.  DELIVERED FOR THREE employees.  BBQ was outstanding.  We each ordered sandwiches and sides and my wife commented on how generous the portions were.  Generous portions, great taste and delivered by one of the owners. Doesn't get much better than that!  We will definitely be calling Hap's for our future employee lunches."}
{"text":"BEST BRISKET EVER!  I've clever here several times and tried different things, but the brisket sandwich is UNBEATABLE! The ham sandwich with red wine cherries is delicious if you're looking for something different, and it's also the only place I've seen that has a pulled LAMB sandwich! My husband LOVED it! It's a small place that gets really busy at lunch time, so get there early. This is also a female owned, family business, and I love supporting people that work hard dork do their best! They've been in business over 30 years, so they must be doing something right!"}
{"text":"I went here with someone from work not expecting much, and holy cow, I was blown away. The pulled lamb is the best I've ever had. (And it comes with a side of this delicious mint sauce stuff that is so good.) They have amazing corn bread, garlic bread, and this spicy broccoli and cheese casserole. It's in a sort of bad part of town, but the rougher the neighborhood the better the barbque."}
{"text":"Excellent Portion of ribs on Half rack dinner, Coleslaw was decent could have been Costco. Corn bread was ok. I would go back. I am still looking for the BBQ joint to go to."}
{"text":"Easily the best BBQ I've had in the Valley. And I've eaten allot over the past 30 years. You don't really need any sauce on the ribs. Tons of flavor and great meat that doesn't need to be covered up. You pay for a rack of ribs here, not twice as much by the pound like Little Miss who's ribs that aren't nearly as good.      I've been eating here since they were in a trailer. I'd stop by going to Honeywell and grab ribs for me and my boss. Lots of brownie points there. He never complained!      They even have real Cobbler for desert and a nice selection of meats including a sumptuous Lamb.       You will leave here very happy if you know anything about BBQ!"}
{"text":"I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised. I have frequently commented that the number of good BBQ joints in Phoenix is lacking. This is located in a small shopping area just down from my office and today I decided to stop by with a friend rather than my typical drive past.  We arrived at a great time - just seconds before the long line formed. She ordered the pulled pork sandwich and I went for the same but Tennessee style (that's topped with slaw for y'all from from the south). David B. described the quality of food in relationship to the decor. Another indicator is the level of sloppiness. When I slowly opened the aluminum foil and saw the saucey/cole slaw mess, my expectations increased. The sandwich was of large size and presented a dilema for me and my dining partner (perhaps more for her as she was wearing a nice business suit) - do we dive in and end up wearing half it on our pants and shirt, or should we be civilized and use a knife and fork. Yes, the alternative would require both utensils. Given we had several work hours left in the day, we elected the later. The flavor was excellent. The saucy perfect and the slaw set it off just right.   Two large sandwiches and two medium drinks - just over $13. I was seriously eyeing that piece of sweet potato pie or the brownie...who am I kidding? AND the brownie...but I refrained.  I have to put this spot near the top of my Phoenix BBQ locations. I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Beware after 5  I have stopped by here on the way home several times.  Food always seems microwave heated.  It's ok but not great.  Stopped in today and ordered a cheese burger.  This sandwich had exactly meat, cheese (extra .80 cents) and bun.  No lettuce no tomato.  I did decline the mayo mustard and got a little BBQ sauce.  Overall the burger was tired - looking like an am/pm burger.  Not worth the time or money to pick it up at all.  Another time I ordered a beef brisket dinner and got home to find they had not included BBQ sauce - what BBQ place forgets the BBQ sauce?  I've had lunch here and it was really good.  It seems like the problems are always after 5."}
{"text":"Decided to go to Hap's for lunch today from my fellow Yelpers reviews. I had the pulled pork sandwich Tennessee style, potato salad, Cole slaw, and Mr Pibb.  I will say that when I walked in it was clean, busy, and smelled pretty good. They do use the old fashioned wight up a ticket and put it on the cooks line. So, one guys order seemed to get over looked while i was waiting in line. No biggie to me, he seemed a little irritated. They promptly took care of him in a hurry though.  I got my food pretty quick, unwrapped my sandwich and was very much pleased at my $4.69 sandwich. It was piled on with pork and did have just the right amount of sauce ( not too much where that is all you taste) I enjoyed the pork very much, it wasn't fatty at all and had a really nice flavor.  The sides were a little lackluster for me. The Cole slaw was \"OK\" pretty bland, not a lot of flavor. The Potato salad on the other hand was full of flavor, just not the flavor I like. I think it had some kind artichoke in it. I guess im used to the mustard potato salad mom used to make.  Overall I would recommend this place. I will be back for the beef brisket and more Mr. Pibb."}
{"text":"This is a good all around little joint. The BBQ is tasty and on the same level as most chains. Unfortunately for the lunch crowd it's a little expensive, the price is usually driven up by the fact that they don't have meals. You have to order sides and a drink separate so $11-15 bucks for lunch isn't worth it.  If I had one thing I could change it would be to add more traditional sides, a lunch menu and more cuts of meat as options. I've had the pulled pork a few times and it is very decent."}
{"text":"My father-in-law finally took me to Hap's after keeping the place a secret for years. I am glad he did. The best ribs I have had in a LONG time!!! I will DEFINITELY be going back!!!"}
{"text":"Ive seen this place riding on the lightrail, but have not stopped here until now because they A) do not have thier own stop and it requires me to drive down, and B) are not open past 4 on Saturdays and are closed on Sundays.    So I finally drag myself down there on Saturday for some BBQ.  The place is part of a really nice clean little strip mall with adaquate parking.  Place has adaquate seating and you order at the counter.  No waiter service here, which is fine by me.  They have lunch and dinner options, and being that I wasnt all that hungry for a dinner plate on a Saturday afternoon, I went for a Beef Brisket sandwich.  The \"lunch\" menu is more ala carte.  No sides, and you chose what you want to go with your order.  The lady at the register said its a better value to get the dinner plate, which comes with some sides, and is only a few dollars more.  I just didnt want that much food this time so I kept it small.  The sandwich was fine.  Not the greatest, but I did enjoy my experience here.  I will probably return and try the dinner plate at some point, as this place seems legit, clean and has a full menu.  I was torn between 3 and 4 stars, and being that I wasnt blown away, I went with 3 stars since I I felt that was more realistic to my experience there then bumping it up to 4.  Its worth a shot at this place, and I really did like it."}
{"text":"I had been looking forward to trying this place out for awhile.  However, I shouldn't have.    I ordered the brisket and pulled pork dinner and it came with a side, so I ordered mashed potatoes.  The meat was below average and didn't taste fresh.  The mashed potatoes were not good either.  The dinner roll that is used to put the meat on for the pulled pork was the only thing that was decent.  I did not care for the bbq sauce. I ordered the cherry cobbler but thew it out after one bite.  I do NOT recommend this restaurant.  If you want good bbq, go to Little Miss BBQ!"}
{"text":"Great Food, Great working people that know what their doing, and great vision from the owner.  Quality and service are top notch with a clean environment is hard to beat.  I don't know who has the best bbq anymore.  Give me a suggestion if you know of any.   Of Course Ribs at the best, Pulled Pork, rib tips and many sides to choose from.    I had no idea of the 24th Street and Jefferson Location, Thanks David B."}
{"text":"Stopped in here today after reading the reviews of others. The ribs are delicious. I also had ham and beef brisket although good there was nothing special about them. I really enjoyed the Old Settler Beans. I am not much of a potato salad person so I took one bite and I was done. My friend found it to be wonderful and ate both hers and mine. I must admit this is some of the best BBQ I have found here in AZ. I will definitely return for the ribs they were tender, flavorful and just all around wonderful."}
{"text":"Great ribs! Miles better than the ribs at Bobby Q, and cheaper too! I took some out-of-town friends here on a Saturday afternoon, and we sat outside with our rib plates. They were pretty down on the Arizona food scene (being snobby NYers), but after our meal they said they were pleased to finally have a good meal after bad ones in Sedona, Flagstaff and at the Grand Canyon. I definitely would go back and hopefully I'll have room for peach cobbler next time."}
{"text":"My two coworkers and I had lunch today at Hap's. Somehow I was unaware of this place before today. The Owner was working the cash register and she was super friendly, engaging, and was nice enough to share her story about her family having owned this spot for decades. I loved hearing her family's story! I am all about supporting hard working local families who are adding value to our community. On to the food.... Our order experience was great and the food came out quick. I had the BBQ chicken and pork ribs. I ordered the sauce on the side (the only way to order BBQ). The chicken was super moist , perfectly smoky, and the dry rub had the perfect amount of kick. The ribs were very tender and flavorful. I had the BBQ beans and there were great too- they were not too sugary sweet like some other BBQ beans in town. My friends had the rib tips and they loved them too. The cornbread was pretty good, but my grandmas cornbread recipe is better. ? Looking forward to returning soon."}
{"text":"Absolutely average at best. Service is pretty slow and the pork sandwich I had was very greasy. Restaurant was clean except the gang banging graffiti in the restroom.   Pulled pork was ok, IMHO I believe no sauce should be put on your sandwich. Should always be on the side so we know you're not hiding anything with sauce, but as I said earlier, greasy.   Single rib was just ok too. Obviously they do not take the time to remove the membrane from the back side. Pretty important to me. No combustion ring either. I think they may be cheating some way. Ive never smoked ribs, or anything else for that matter, that didn't have a ring when done.   Potato salad tasted old and a bit over peppered."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that Barbecued  Pork is my absolute favorite food.  I could eat BBQ Pork and coleslaw every single day if I knew I'd live.  And Hap's definitely delivered on awesome barbecue.  To me, I want the people who make my bbq to have a passion for the pit, to love the craft, because really, it is a craft.  And as soon as I walked in the lady (owner?) behind the counter spoke to me with such dedication about how Hap's barbecues their pork...and why it was the best joint in town. Awesome.  She also hooked me up with some extra pork because I couldn't decide what I wanted...everything just sounded too good and mouth couldn't stop watering. That's customer service.  When I did finally decide and got my order it was just what I wanted. Succulent pulled pork on an open faced sandwich that wasn't skimpy on the sauce.  The sauce was incredible too, a really flavorful zing that was way beyond what you can get in the grocery store.  My meal also came with delicious and moist corn bread and a good helping of coleslaw....you just can't get bbq pork with out coleslaw..Im sorry but its absolutely necessary :P  Bottom line, awesome joint where the people really care about the food they make which definitely shows."}
{"text":"Was driving around looking for a quick bite and found this place, decided to give it a shot. Ordered a beef brisket sandwich to go and it was pretty good. Definitely smelled incredible and I wouldn't mind trying some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"I hadn't eaten all day at work and wanted a quick and easy meal. This place was on my way home from work so I decided to give it a try.  The food is pretty mediocre. I was able to try the ribs, brisket, smoked sausage, coke slaw and corn bread. I'll start with what I enjoyed most - the ribs. It was aesthetically pleasing and passed the smell test but just didn't have a whole lot of flavor. I couldn't taste the rub very well. It did have a nice smoke ring around it and was very tender. Both brisket and sausage were so-so. The brisket looked least appealing because they chopped it up. It looked more like pulled pork than brisket. Both were, again, not full on flavor. Their BBQ sauce was pretty decent. It was pretty sweet with quite a bit of smokey flavor. The smokiness may be too much for some but I thought it was good. The coke slaw and corn bread were very basic so let's just leave it at that.   Service was fast and friendly and the place was very clean. I would only suggest this place if you're really really craving BBQ and do not have time to wait in Little Miss BBQ's outrageous lines."}
{"text":"I love my bbq, and this is one of the best I've had. Great quality food and awesome service. If you're a regular they know your name. Come back often, they have daily specials that are off the menu. Don't come between noon and twelve thirty, though. The line is out the door and there's no place to sit. That's how great this place is."}
{"text":"So after an uneventful  trip to Honey Bears the previous week I decided to try out Hap's.  It is just as close to my house and the reviews were pretty decent so I wanted to try for myself.    I got the Brisket sandwich which was actually really good.  The sauce was dripping out the sides all nice and messy like a BBQ sandwich should be.  It was a tangy and sweet sauce with nice flavor.  The brisket was chopped into nice pieces so every bite you weren't ripping it apart.  I also had corn bread as my side.  It was decent sweet and crumbly like it should be.    Overall I think I have made the switch I still have to try out Stacey's but Hap's is quality and they have a great menu even including lamb."}
{"text":"Potato salad not good at all. Beans not good at all. Ribs were really pink and when its pork I rather be safe than sorry. U ordered garlic bread and that was a joke ! How can u mess up garlic bread cmon guys ! Youll never see me there again but u can catch at honey bears tho !"}
{"text":"16 Family members came together and I did not want any of them cooking for the event. Haps BBQ is the place to go for catering an event. Chrissy and her employees are great. Everything went off without a hitch. Timing was perfect. Food (Ribs, Brisket, pulled pork, Old Settler Beans, Broccoli Cheese Casserole, Cole Slaw, Apple and Peach Cobbler) was excellent. Flavor was out of this world. Could not have asked for a more perfect event. Thank you Chrissy"}
{"text":"Absolutely love their brisket sandwich! Nothing compares to this sandwich. But I wish they were open until later for those late night cravings!"}
{"text":"This place serves the best BBQ within 5miles of the place I currently spend most of my billing hours.  Certainly better than the BBQ Company on 36th.  I get the 2 meat combo which comes with a side (beans), chips (good chips), and 2 meats of your choice for like $7.50-$8.  I've tried and been impressed with the Pulled Pork, Brisket, and Smoked Ham.  Their meats have a very nice flvor and are served with just a tiny drizzle of bbq sauce, nothing more.  The flavor of the meats speak for themselves, you really don't need bbq sauce, but the drizzle is a nice compliment as opposed to being the main dish as it is at other, gross, bbq places.  Service is quick, efficient, and very friendly.  They have a lot of micro-brew-ish sodas, fresh homemade deserts, and other yummy treats, if that's your thing."}
{"text":"I do simple reviews after having BBQ in 49 states...  :)  Pork: Great Chicken: Great Beef: Good Ribs: Awesome Beans: Awesome - Strangely similar to what you get at Joe's in Gilbert...  Hmmm.... Slaw: Meh.  I'm not a fan of the large chunks of cabbage.  I like mine shredded better.  The seating is very limited and the line gets long around noon (out the door long).    It's best to get it to go."}
{"text":"If you LOVE BBQ, make your way here to Haps!!! It's amazing and the owner is as sweet as she can be. The food is absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"I love Haps! Tried and true some of the best pulled pork and brisket in the area. You don't have to wait in line forever and it's family owned and operated. It has all your bbq needs and at the right time. The baked beans are amazing! Corn bread is awesome too. Ribs are not to popular, but give them a try. I feel as if they are hit or miss. I see a line here most of the time, but it goes quickly because the owners know that there customers want to be in and out and not wait for 2 hours in line! Sometimes you don't have that much time to spend on some brisket...Especially in the summer. I highly recommend this place and have been going here for 4 years. They deserve lots of credit for lasting this long as a small business with so much competition, you know there 1 of the best bbq spots in the valley. All you haters think you know what real bbq is blah blah blah, fact is, it's all a matter of opinion. If you don't like it, move on. Because obviously a lot of people love this place and it keeps people coming back, even you bad reviewers. If you don't like sauce on your sandwich get it on the side genius! If you want to wait in line for 2 hours go to little miss bbq. But this place is amazing, with amazing people and food. Try it for yourself, you might just find yourself going back again and again."}
{"text":"Sorry, but I'm just not a huge fan. My co-workers seemed to like it and they get pretty good reviews, so maybe it was just an off day for them. The beans were pretty good since they had bacon in them, but there were lima beans in them too. Yuck!"}
{"text":"I wasn't sure about this place at first due to some shaky reviews, glad I tried it very good pulled pork bbq sandwich & coleslaw. The owner was nice too, a restaurant that's been around since the 90's must be doing something right.  I called and told the owner well done"}
{"text":"Growing up in Chicago, I know a little something about BBQ.  I've been to Hap's before and got the meat sampler and liked the beef, and the sliced sausage was ok.  However, I recently went to get ribs for the entire family and was really, really disappointed. I ordered one full slab plus 1/2 slab of ribs.  We had to purchase extra BBQ sauce, as we were only given two of their containers of BBQ sauce... for 18 ribs.  No corn bread or anything came with that many ribs...ok.    Unfortunately, the entire family accurately complained that there was about 80% thick fat on the bones and very little meat to be had.  $35.00 for fat, bones and BBQ sauce was not the way I planned a Friday night meal with the family. The person picking the meat for this store needs to choose better slabs.   Sorry about the meal tonight, kids.  I'll have to think twice before coming here for ribs again.  Not many decent rib places in Phoenix."}
{"text":"\"Hand rubbed meat can't be beat.\" That's what a t-shirt reads. It's hung up on the wall next to other things, like posters with catchy phrases and local acknowledgments of Hap's being the best BBQ around town.   This place is really just a hop, skip and jump from my office. On a rainy November day, BBQ sounds superb. So, I hop, skip and jump over to Hap's. It's my first time and I'm curious to see how they do BBQ. After all, I hail from the south, you could say, and have eaten some pretty great BBQ in Oklahoma and Texas.   At Hap's around 12 on a Friday, there's a line out the door. I agree to wait. The wait allows me to check out the decor and patrons. It's mostly men here, and I begin to think, \"What a meat market.\" Literally, with pulled pork, lamb, chicken, ham and links as your choices. But, all I see when I look around are young and middle aged men. Some are rather cute. Who knew such things existed in this business area off Washington and 48th St.   I'm not the only one with wandering eyes. I notice several of the patrons take notice of me, the only young female in the place. Yep, that's right. I'm here for the BBQ.   The menu is a bit cumbersome to read. There's the regular menu and a catering one. Then there's a small black board with suggested specials. I jump at the chance to try their smoked BBQ lamb with their mint dressing on the side. Mint isn't the only dressing option you have, but it sounded like the ideal match for lamb - even the little black board said so.   So, it's my turn at the register. The woman behind the counter gives me a big, friendly smile. I smile back. \"I'd like to try your smoked lamb sandwich with mint on the side.\" I tell her it's to go. She punches up my total - $5.07 - runs my card and hands me a receipt. She also asks for my name, for when you place an order here and it's ready, they shout out your name. Not some number. Not profanity. Your name. Very cool. Well, they didn't have a chance to shout my name. While the woman hands me my receipt copy and card, a man leans over the counter. \"Alicia?\" Yep. \"Here you go. Enjoy.\" I didn't even have to wait one millisecond. I snatch up the bag and left. It's not that I wanted to eat there, but if I had, there wouldn't have been any open booths anyway - just a couple of stools against the wall, nearly in the way of the line of hungry lunchers.   I anticipate biting into the sandwich and having an \"oohhh\" moment. The sandwich is sloppy, pieces of lamp escaping the entrapment of the bun. I dunk the lamb pieces in the mint dressing, which is my favorite part of the sandwich. Don't get me wrong, the meat is good. It just didn't wow me. Nor did the bun, which is your basic hamburger bun you can buy at the grocery store. The sauce was also just okay. I mean, I could tell it was BBQ sauce, but, let's face it, it wasn't oh-my-god BBQ sauce. So...   3 stars for Hap's. I can see why Phoenix likes this place, for it offers up a plethora of BBQ options and sides, including broccoli and cheese casserole. Or, supposedly, they have a really great cauliflower casserole. My friend says so. If that's not your thing, there's bags of chips, cobbler (peach, cherry, etc.), chocolate nut brownies and even coleslaw.   So, why not a higher rating? Because I wasn't wowed by their translation of BBQ. Granted, I ordered one simple sandwich, but even that one simple sandwich, with all its flavor and sustenance, wasn't enough for me to deem this place my preferred lunch destination.   Yet, it's definitely worth checking out.  (But, as my friend told me, \"It's no Honey Bears.\")"}
{"text":"Good lunch spot for some simple BBQ food. This is near my office, so I've eaten there several times. I usually get 1/4 chicken all white meat of BBQ chicken, and a couple ribs on the side. The BBQ sauce is tasty, and the meat quality is good. It's a perfect quick lunch spot."}
{"text":"Best ribs. Great brisket. Wish they had more side items here.  I have to go down the road to Honey Bear's to get my collard greens.  (Don't get the ribs here unless you can tell them to cut fresh ones from the slab because they pre-cut individual ribs and they end up drying up and not tasting good at all.)"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times I should I get the fatty brisket it's awesome I've had the ribs as well they are very good never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Have been here twice and that's it. Really expensive for the food you get and it's so not worth it. Paid almost, $6 for a quesadilla that I could've made at home for at least half the price.  The brisket was amazing and the only reason this place is getting two stars. Beware!!"}
{"text":"You don't need to eat here.  All you have to do is walk in, take a big breath and you'll feel satisfied...and instantly addicted.  The smell in that restaurant is so potent it got on my clothes and I smelled it all day at work. No, but seriously.  Great bbq.  I'm not going to tell you it's better or worse than others.  It's just delicious on its own. And the smoked salmon salad is to die for."}
