{"text":"I am something of a burger connoisseur and these burgers are AMAZING! My husband and I eat here for $13 total and we are always super satisfied. The owners take pride in making everything fresh and presentable, and the care that goes into their cooking can't be beat. I do not understand why people complain about the wait or ambiance and let that negatively affect the score- it's the FOOD that matters, and the food is incredible for the price."}
{"text":"The burgers are pretty excellent. Kind of peppery. I also like the bun they use, no seeds. They have a wide range of toppings, cheese and sauces. The fries are always crispy and good.   The Kogo (korean pogo), which is a pogo with little fry nibs in it, is completely out of this world. You pick a sauce to dip it in. It's definitely comfort food.   They lose one star for speed of service and lack of tables. It would be really great if they could have more than one table and three stools. I guess the speed accounts for the size as there is usually only one or two people there at once.  Worth the wait, and the cost of extra toppings."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant period. Amazing unbelievable food and cost I would rather come here than fine cuisine. One week I ate it every day straight it's that good."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've had. The place is small but the food is awesome! Everything is fresh and tasts great"}
{"text":"L'hamburger steak est ok  mais trop chère. Il commence à 4.50$ mais peut monter facilement à une dizaine de dollars avec les extras. Le take out peut prendre facilement une quinzaine de minutes (pour un hamburger). Trop de boucane à l intérieur aussi lorsque il est en pleine production."}
{"text":"So this place has me a little bit confused. On the one hand, I really want to say that I'm rating it on the burgers which are pretty decent, on the other hand, they have a specialty called a Kogo which is just AWESOME!  Okay, so the 3* rating on top is for the burger, so I'll get into that:  The burger is bought as a basic with nothing on it. Then you begin picking and choosing all from the vegetables and different, sometimes exotic, sauces to put on the burger. The list of add-ons can range from the basic \"cheddar, pickle, ketchup\" to \"brie, caramelized onions, wasabi mayonnaise\". Yeah. It's cool. The meat is where I felt a slight short coming though. I think there's some kind of herb in it, maybe like parsley that makes it taste a little bit like the Arabic grill meat \"Kafta\". It's a decent burger though. If I was hungry and it was there, I wouldn't think twice about ordering it. Of course, though, the add-ons could become expensive. The brie goes for $2.00 and the caramelized onions go for $1.50. On top of a $5.00 burger that isn't too big, we're talking possibly $10 for a not so big burger. Still, it's fun to try these random things on your patty of meat.  The Kogo though, I would rate 5*. What's a Kogo? A Korean Pogo. It's basically a corn dog whose batter was mixed in with chopped potato cubes and the deep-fried to make one hell of a heart-busting snack. It's heavy, greasy, and combined with their amazing spicy mayonnaise sauce it makes it a gorgeous, artery clogging snack. If that's not your cup of tea though, then don't bother. I LOVE it! Okay maybe I exaggerated a little. It is quite heavy but the reason I explained it like that cause on my first time, I went ahead and got 3 of them. It was hell and walking back home, I felt my heart cursing me.  Anyway, the rating I gave was based on their burgers, so if that's what you're here for, look at the paragraph on the burgers."}
{"text":"We planned for a walk around and found this shop..not much crowded so we thought to give a try and bought chicken burger there..it was insanely delicious..they are so polite and you customize things as you can.should give a try..the price is also worth it..."}
{"text":"The old friendly couple that owns this place is the best!   They make awesome burgers and you can just keep adding and adding things to it (at a surcharge). They also make great fries which is always a deal breaker for me. I don't know what people are talking about when they say the burgers are too salty-- I think it's the perfect amount of salt for a greasy burger joint.   Would 100% recommend!"}
{"text":"Stopped by Picks to get a quick bite before a movie. I saw that it had a pretty good rating on Yelp so I figured I'd give it a shot. I went with my girlfriend and when we both walked in we noticed the place was really small and a little unclean but nothing that bad. We both ordered a bacon cheeseburger with fries. The price was decent and the burgers looked pretty big. Upon both of our first bites we looked at each other and both agreed that this was one of the best burgers we had eaten so far. It was so delicious and the burger was firm and didn't fall apart yet it was also juicy. I'd give this a 5 star review for the burger although the fries were really basic and seemed like just normal frozen fries they bought and then fried up to serve. Overall a great meal but don't expect much from the fries or the ambiance, though the burger makes up for it tenfold."}
{"text":"It's not much to look at, and it really could use a new coat of paint but Picks remains a go-to place for me. I've tried their kogos and was okay with them but where they shine despite themselves is in the burger topping department. Understand this: they are re-firing your patty so don't expect a plump and juicy burger. Rather, you will get a patty that does not interfere with the toppings that you chose to grace upon your burger. This, actually, is a good thing, and I'll tell you why. The lettuce, kimchi, and wasabi mayonnaise burger that I ordered not once relinquished a single drop to the plate. Nope, every last nose-hair singeing molecule of wasabi stayed on station and every drop of pungent kimchi juice assaulted my mouth and lips. My face was on fire from the delicious double whammy of spices yet I continued to smile like the Buddha. Ohm nom nom..."}
{"text":"I helped a friend move a few months back and in the spirit of friendship he purchased beer and burgers.  He took me here and holy $HIT!  THIS PLACE IS GOOD!  An absolutely customizable burger in every way with a friendly, what seems to be husband and wife staff and a whole plethora of unique toppings, sauces and patties!  The prices also compare or beat almost every other burger joint plus you get the quality of a high end place!  I have been coming back ever since.  The only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is because its not much of a sit in place.  Hopefully if we all come here more they can expand and get a bigger place!  :)  Now go try it! I guarantee you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Small and cozy, lots of quirky ingredient choices for your burgers, definitely recommended"}
{"text":"Stack it till it can't fit in my mouth. Everything there is fresh and full of love. Bring the kogos :p"}
{"text":"A small little hideout. Reasonably priced. They offer various options that you can choose to pair up your burger with. The veg burger was the best I have had so far for this price (around 6$). Must try!"}
{"text":"Always good solid burgers totally customizable and the kogos are great don't forget to drink an Arnold Palmer they stock em"}
{"text":"I read about this place on eater montreal. A cute family owned business- decorated with a wall of coloured index cards on one side. You order and create your own burger with different toppings at a fair cost/ including toppings like Kimchi and wasabi mayo! I also ordered a Korean pogo- kogo, that resembled a culinary souvenir. With a drink, my meal was around $12. More of a take out place."}
{"text":"I've only eaten here once, however I'm more loyal to Buns' burgers, which is literally around the corner. The (better) difference here is that you can choose your burger toppings and have more of a variety of options to choose from, which can make it more appealing.   My definite recommendation: The \"Kogo,\" or Korean Pogo, is absolutely delicious and what the majority of this review is riding on."}
{"text":"While waiting on line for Kazu, I became hungry and craved for some poutine. Who knew there was going to be a little shop that served poutine just around the block from Kazu? When I went into the shop, it was packed with people waiting. I went up to the counter and ordered some poutine. As I was waiting, I was able to witness what type of other food the place made. They make burgers that seems to have a fusion taste. The price was very fair, but the shop is small, so you might not be able to find a seat when it gets busy! The poutine was good, but I wished there were more cheese!"}
{"text":"Funny little shop that serves cheap and yummy fast food.  The burger meat is marinated, which gives it a lot of flavor. Overall good, but nothing amazing.  Check our their wall of wonders - it's full of drawing and notes left by thankful customers!"}
{"text":"Excellent place for what it is, a good Korean quality burger to go with some onion rings and kimchi. Will take this over McDonald's all day all night its somewhat unique. I wouldn't actually sit and eat there, the place is quite small and not much of an ambiance"}
{"text":"lovely price! lovely owners! lovely food! go eat here! it's great! the poutine i got was ok, but the burger? it was great! it's the best quality you can get for the price! so don't go to a&w burger king or mcdonald's, come here when you want some drunk eats! it's great!!!!"}
{"text":"The Subway of burgers! You select a basic burger, then add the extra ingredients you want. You'll end up with a cheap and delicious burger!  Fries are awesome too. And you have to try their home-made pogo.  There's a downside: it doesn't have a sitting place, so it's mostly to take out."}
{"text":"The restaurant look a little bit creepy but the fries are amazing, and the food in general is pretty good"}
{"text":"Small place, great burgers for their cheap price. They do them in front of you. Good meat. If you want you can eat it there, but it is quite a small place, better order to go. If the place is crowded, it will take some time to get your burger since they do it on the spot, which I don't have a problem with that. I'm happy I discovered this place, will defenetely come back."}
{"text":"Friendly little fast food shop tucked in off St-Catherines serving fast food with a korean flair. A friendly korean couple owns the place (its rare to see home-made fast food nowadays). They are most known for their Kogo (french fries covered Pogo) and their customizable burgers (get kimchi, a korean fermented vegetable - often cabbage, it adds a nice tang to your burger).   The Kogo is a bit too salty and way too oily to my liking: I have trouble eating the whole thing due to how oily it is. The burgers on the other hand are quite delicious and cheap."}
{"text":"Our first dinner in Canada because they accepted credit cards.   This place is bomb. Its owed and run by old Korean couple. You order by marking your order on their paper and marker.   Very reasonable price for a well made burger that doesnt have the greasy after taste."}
{"text":"Located near Concordia, this is a small burger joint ran which seems to be family run by Koreans. Inside the restaurant, there are about 3 tables, which seats 2 people each. Went there at dinner time and there was lots of traffic. They also offer Foodora and UberEats.   The way you order the food there is that you take a small order sheet and pick your order yourself and any add-ons that you'd like on your burger.  I ordered their burger, with 2 patties, egg, sauteed mushrooms and aioli sauce. The burger came up so massive, I had difficulty taking a bite of it. Taste-wise, it is what you expect from a decent burger. Service was kinda slow but within a reasonable time.   Bottomline, decent place for burger for a decent price!"}
{"text":"Really fantastic hole-in-the-wall. What makes this place is the add-ons - I had the wasabi mayo and dried tomato sauces, the former which gave the burger an incredibly unique flavor. I opted out of cheese, but I think brie or gouda would have been really interesting. Creative and delicious."}
{"text":"Tried this place today and I had the spicy chicken and shrimp K-Tacos. The chicken was good but the shrimp are a must!  Only minor con is they don't take credit cards  They also deliver!"}
{"text":"The sirloin STEAK BURGER is the ONLY way to go.  *Tiny* price difference for MUCH better quality & tasting meat.   I make it a double :)    Option to have it wrapped in lettuce for gluten-free / paleo diet.    The place itself, aside from being quite small, is pretty dingy :/  so don't expect a nice sit-down environment.    The food negates this tough :))  Korean tacos look amazing and are a really good value.   (I personally haven't tried as they are wrapped in a soft wheat tortilla and I don't eat gluten.)"}
{"text":"Why did I find about this place so late? Such a gem.  Customized burgers that aren't too heavy in the pockets? This is your spot. If you like burgers, this is still your spot!   Picks is tiny, I almost felt claustrophobic and it was just me, my husband and the cooks at the restaurant.   There are variety of options to chose from, they also give their best picks (pun intended!)  We ordered a picks special burger each and then guiltily ordered a third single beef patty burger to share.   I love how quick the cooks are, and they were nice enough to patiently listen to me during my indecisive rant about meats. I'm eagerly waiting for the day someone says the magical words 'let's grab dinner from picks'. The burgers are basic, packed with all the essentials and I would like to think love.   I go here often and highly recommend this place to everyone. If you happen to stop by and see a girl who just can't decide on which burger to get- make sure you do say hello (spoilt by choice)"}
{"text":"I got a Kogo. It's effectively a Pogo (but higher-quality) with built-in fries, and the batter's a little more potatoey, so it's got this nice texture. It should taste good with any dip, but I'd suggest the aioli. Didn't try the burger but they looked pretty fly."}
{"text":"From outside, this little spot seems suspicious if not a little strange.. but Pick's is a wonderful little gem for burgers made-to-order and run by two very sweet owners. Prices are fairly reasonable, the toppings are all fresh and wonderful, the sides are super tasty and with just the right homemade feeling. All in all, the kind of burger place you should drop by anytime you're in the Concordia / Shaughnessy Village area."}
{"text":"Create your own burger- tempura onions,chipotle mayo, swiss cheese, ketchup,lettuce, pickles,tomato and then say Welcome to heaven and god bless the sweet koreon couple who run the joint!"}
{"text":"I just discovered Picks yesterday, and I'm kicking myself for not having tried it sooner! I used to like Buns burgers but Picks is so much better on so many levels and still doesn't break the bank. It's a tiny place with lots of character-- half of it is the open kitchen, and one wall is covered by pictures drawn by customers past. You get a paper menu and colour in your picks, and then voila! a beautiful burger exactly the way you want it. They have a great variety of sauces, cheeses, and toppings to choose from. I had never tried kimchi or wasabi mayo on a burger before but everyone must try this!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Just got a burger with bacon, sun dried toamtoes sauce and mushrooms! sauce is a incredible! burger juice and taste! Not expensive! ;) I paied 10,50 $ burger with fries!  if there is something negative, its salty, but still delicious.  Go for it."}
{"text":"????????????????????????????????????????? ???????????????"}
{"text":"Went in to order take out fries... After ordering, i had to wait for five minutes for them to even drop the fries into the oil. The workers were all huddled around an iPad watching TV."}
{"text":"This is one of my absolute FAVORITE places to eat in montreal. The burgers are fairly priced, and the list of toppings puts this place above their competitors (like buns around the corner).   You can chose from a beef burger, grilled chicken or steak. Personally, I am a huge fan of the chicken burger since i find it hard to find chicken burgers that aren't deep fried and that aren't super expensive. I usually get provolone, mushrooms and wasabi mayo on top. The fries and onion rings aren't anything special, but they go great with the meal.   If you are on the more adventurous side, I would suggest ordering the salad. The dressing almost tastes like a creamy ponzu sauce, and is super delicious.   I've tried the kogos too. They're cheaper than ordering a burger and you get a free dipping sauce. The kogos are like corndogs but the batter has little pieces of potato in them. Very yummy.   You can get a variety of sodas and juices to go with your meal. If i get a burger, side and a drink it comes up to about $9-$10.   I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Possibly the best burgers I've had so far in montreal. All orders are made fresh & made to order. Each burger is also personalized, and also their combos are personalized as well. I like how they organize their orders with the paper u write on, that way they won't miss a topping or make a mistake and u get exactly what u order! Only complain is that this place is verrrryyy small. Like even 10 people in the restaurant would be way to crowded. Also their bathrooms are all the way in the back (you have to walk in their kitchen to get to the bathroom). Other than that, I would definitely come back here for the burgers :)"}
{"text":"Chicken taco is my favourite. The food is cheap with very high quality. It is worthwhile to drop by. This store opens until midnight. It's good for night snacks too."}
{"text":"Hey Picks love your food and come to you once a week but please get rid of that arrogant kid behind counter if you want to keep your loyal customers..; cause you guys are doing an amazing job"}
{"text":"It may look suspicious from the outside, but when you get to taste the food it's amazing! The price is reasonable. If you want authentic fast food, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"Very good bugers with many different toppings to chose from including Kimchi (gimchi, kimchee, or kim chee)  Service is quick and efficient though you'll probably need to take it to go since there is VERY LIMITED seating.  Poutine, fries, pogos are also on the menu; they also have sweet potato fries"}
{"text":"Amazing burgers from a local business! The Korean couple that work there are so cute and the customizable burgers is a very nice concept. They have fried eggs and kimchi as toppings options!! The price is also very fair for the quality of the burgers - nice meat, nice bun, fresh toppings. I highly recommend this place if you have a craving for a nice, satisfying burger and don't really care for a nice setting. The only thing is that the seating area is very small so during peak hours expect to have it to go. (You can the burgers delivered too!!)"}
{"text":"My sister and I had just arrived to our hotel and were looking for a quick dinner before we turned in for the night. After a walk through the nearby blocks of Rue St. Catherine, we ended up at Picks.   Picks is just around the corner from Rue St. Catherine and a small family-owned restaurant. There were only a few tables but my sister and I managed to snag one for ourselves. Ordering was a little confusing- there were these little sheets of paper where we could customize our burgers, but the sheet of paper didn't include all of the other menu items. To keep it simple, my sister and I ordered a burger each and added on a poutine as a side.   Burgers were good, although I thought it was a bit dry. Thankfully, I added kimchi so it added moisture and flavor. My sister liked hers. The standout was definitely the poutine! Now that our Montreal/Quebec City vacation is done, I've asked my sister which poutine she liked best and she picked Picks'!  3.5, but since my sister really liked their poutine, rounded up to 4."}
{"text":"Man, I love Picks so much! When you just need a tasty, salty, beefy experience, they're the ones to go to! This little burger joint is run by a nice Korean couple--they offers k-tacos and kimchi, which you probably won't see elsewhere.  Their burgers are usually a little dry, but not to worry, they offer a bunch of delicious sauces and toppings.  Their fries are always crispy and golden, and so, their poutine is one of my favourites.   If you're looking for a delicious meal on a budget, go to Picks!"}
{"text":"I kind of liked this place, the ambiance is cool and the food was quick.   Now the food: (I have to preface this by saying I'm a bit of a burger snob and haven't found a burger that I've really liked outside of the states ever) the burger meat was over seasoned and well done. I liked the fries, they were crispy, and not overcooked. Seasoned perfectly.  The burger did not agree with my stomach at all,  which sucked cause I was really looking forward to it.  If I could give this place a 2.5 stars I would,  but since I liked the fries so much I will round up."}
{"text":"Really good spicy pork k-tacos. They put lettuce, tomato, spicy mayo, onions and pork on a wrap and it's a really nice balance of flavours. Also, affordable, the price is tax included!"}
{"text":"Not shabby! Their poutine rating: 3/5, decent gravy, lots of curds, and golden fries. The burgers are pretty good as well, with the meats being rather flavorful and moist. They do toast their buns, which isn't too bad. However, the wait time can be a bit long. Worth checking out."}
{"text":"Very small shop, with decent burgers I guess, although I don't see how it calls itself specialty burger.   What I ordered:  - Double patties - egg, bacon, grilled red peppers, smoked gouda, fried onion rings.  Breakdown: Due to its size, I had to eat it with a fork and knife, as even half that pile of food wouldn't fit in my mouth.   I took out a patty for the taste test. The patty was cooked well done (they didn't ask how I wanted it cooked) which means it was dry. In terms of seasoning, it tasted better than most patty I found in Montreal, but it's not amazing either, it can use some additional flavoring.    The grilled pepper was grilled inconsistently. One was charred (turned black) and the other was barely grilled.   The slice of smoked gouda was a shame. It was cut so thinly you wouldn't taste it at all, even when you eat it individually. Not worth the 87¢ or whatever it was.  As for the egg... it was cooked 'over hard'. The yolk was solid and tasteless in general. Eggs are supposed to be cooked 'over medium' at most, else the flavor is gone. As a matter of fact, a runny yolk would even have compensated for the dried out patty.   Also, don't take the fried onion rings, they were greasy as hell and funnily didn't taste much like onions.   ----- KOGOS: It's actually just a corn dog with chunks of fried potato coating the usual batter (coating), definitely not something I would take again. You can imagine the taste: bland over bland. The extra potato did not provide extra flavor, it only diluted the bit of flavor of the sausage.   The chipotle mayo that came with the kogo was not good. It wasn't chipotle smokey. It was just mayonnaise and some kind of hot sauce.   -----  The food was overall disappointing, mainly because I had high expectations when I walked through the door.  Objectively speaking, I can see why people like these burgers. There aren't many burgers that would make the 5/10 mark in Montreal.  From the food I got, I think it's pretty clear the chef and cooks in Picks haven't undergone culinary training, at least in american cuisine."}
{"text":"Best burgers in the Concordia ghetto. The selection of cheeses and sauces is second to none!"}
{"text":"I have indeed fell in love with the kimchi burger and lots of sauce. The fries are average quality, they're okay. Edible.  I looooove sauces, which they are generous with!! When you pick up your burger, the sauces are dripping down. The beef patties are not flat and small, they are juicy and delicious. I usually end up paying about $9 for the burger as I add a bunch of things to it.  They are open late so classmates and I end up here after classes. It's just so tempting! They are super small with only three tables. The door does not close properly and is so cold in the winter."}
