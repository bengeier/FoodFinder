{"text":"The food was great and turnover really fast. Great service as well. I recommend all black Tiger shrimp"}
{"text":"Literally a hole in the wall as another reviewer said.   3 tacos for $10 is an amazing deal. Everything is super fresh - means you end up waiting a bit. I will call ahead next time for my order.   Had the taco deal and a burrito. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Small taco place, run by the owner. Friendly service, freshly made tortillas, and good flavours. I am happy that there is more and more real Latin food in the city. This is a no frills, solid taco spot. Check it."}
{"text":"After 2 failed attempts (1st went on Sunday and they are closed on Sundays, 2nd attempt they locked up shop an hour early) but hey 3rd time is a charm. And am i glad that i did decide to give it one more try. I ordered the 3 taco deal for $10 shrimp, chicken and fish. They were all very good but surprisingly my fave ended being the shrimp they were cooked perfectly , fish tacos for me the bar is set high im big on seven lives and bario coreano the fish taco here was delicately battered my qualms here is that the portion size falls a tad short compared to other spots i go to but overall they do a good job and their attention to detail is spot  on.....I will certainly recommend this place and i look forward to trying a few more things"}
{"text":"Some of, if not the best Tacos in the city. The salsa's and sauces are super fresh, and the proteins are all cooked perfectly. Between our party we are just about the whole menu and everybody raved about what they ate. The chorizo taco is a life changer."}
{"text":"What to say about this place... A hidden gem in the Keelsdale neighbourhood.  The owner has an obvious passion for his food and a love for making people enjoy it as much as he cares to cook.  I have been there about 10 times now and have failed to take a picture every time.  Thankfully, this time I took one before I ate.  I haven't had the pork tacos because I don't eat pork but all the other tacos have seen the bottom of my satisfied stomach.  So, why do I like it? Well, it is freshly made, well served and full of authentic flavours.  Everything in the restaurant is homemade, outside of the canned sodas.  You can buy tacos in sets of 3 for $12 or buy them individually.  This place is a must try if you enjoy good food, courteous service and supporting local business."}
{"text":"Very good tacos. The place is small, so you can't really sit and enjoy your tacos BUT the food is amazing here and worth the drive (I live in the suburbs)."}
{"text":"I keep coming back here. It's not even up to me anymore -- my stomach wants what it wants. I'm working my way through the taco selection. Shrimp is my fav so far. Just great eats and never a disappointment."}
{"text":"best tacos I've had in the GTA. good value, super delicious, fresh, authentic. highly recommended. tasty hot sauce. burrito wasnt great, too much rice. free weekend parking at the City hall parking lot a block west on eglinton."}
{"text":"A sweet shrimp A sublime picanha A retro washroom Wow  You know when it's made with love you can feel it. Top notch garnishes, proper and right amount of filling in the taco, fresh sauces, in house-fresh-made tortillas. Vibrant, stunning.   I am the pickiest out there when it comes to tacos, born and raised in Mexico, trust my palate.   Prices are that great that with 20 dollars you walk away bursting.   My lord of the fire, my queen of the land, the gracious saints bless the avocado sauce."}
{"text":"I don't eat much tacos, but this place serves one of the best tacos in the area. I got the fish tacos since I got there at a later time and there wasn't much avaialble, but it was super juicy and they made it just right.  It's a small place, may get crowded.  There is possibly busy hours which I recommend going as early as possible for the better taco selections. But the fish itself convinced me to go back again.  Definitely not a one bite taco."}
{"text":"Hidden gem.  Great food, and cheap.  Friendly staff  and great food.  Sample 6 different tacos, can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Great service but mediocre food. I Ordered shrimp, fish and mole chicken tacos. They all lacked flavour and the chicken was on the dry side. Don't bother ordering chips and salsa"}
{"text":"Great place. I hope that people are able to find it as it is a little bit tucked away off of Eglinton. All food is made on site and tastes fresh. I loved the Guava juice. I hope next time I get there early enough to try the horchata. Price is a tad high but worth it for the quality. Decor is simple and tasteful. I was actually very impressed with the minimalism."}
{"text":"ugh their food is absolutely divine. A friend and I were looking for tacos and we saw the reviews and decided to check it out, if definitely did not disappoint. Their food is fresh and all made on sight. I highly recommend and will definitely be coming back in the future. The owners are super nice as well and welcoming. We also ordered the guava juice and again, it did not disappoint."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been on the hunt for authentic, no nonsense Tacos for a while now. We decided try our luck at El Nahual this afternoon for lunch. We arrived to a little space tucked away at the corner of Keele and Eglinton. Inside there were around 6 stools and a counter. The menu had burritos and quesadillas,  but we were there for the tacos! They were 3 for $12, and you can mix and match. We got the pork carnitas, chicken mole, shrimp, steak, chorizo and barbacoa beef. Our orders came out really quick, especially since we got so many different types.   All of them were minimally dressed, with either onions or slaw and an avocado salsa. I loved that, as it let the flavours of the meat shine! All of them were amazing, but our favourites were the barbacoa and the shrimp. So tender, fresh and flavourful. I also love how the corn tortillas were nicely fried, and weren't super soft. Safe to say we found our favourite tacos: Best in Toronto, hands down!"}
{"text":"Great place, love the quality of food you receive. It's genuinely the definition of hole in wall but regardless great food, and very relaxed, chill atmosphere. Bringing my brother next time!"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best tacos in Toronto! The chefs prepare the tacos with fresh ingredients, authentic flavors and handmade  tortillas - I reiterate handmade tortillas. The Shrimp taco is excellent, but you can't go wrong with the other choices.   Definitely come back again and again..."}
{"text":"I found this place thanks to my wife as we were taking a shortcut as the 401 East was very busy (more than usual) and decided to go through the local roads. Since it was close to dinner time, she found El Nahual through the Yelp app. She was craving Mexican! It was Tacos Thursday.   This place is by Eglinton West on a one way street. Tiny place located amidst the constant construction and traffic around the area. Ideal for takeout as they have very limited seating and space. Even the outside signage is unassuming. There are some pay parking on the front of the store but there's a 3 hour free parking if you turn right in the next street.   My wife and I ordered the same 3 tacos: Gringa, Steak and Shrimp. All of them were very good but the shrimp is the winner. My wife and I would rate the Gringa (Pork) for least favourite. I loved their tortillas. You do have to wait for your tacos as they do per order and they are not premade but that's a small price to pay for such delicious tacos. We washed down the tacos with a Pellegrino drink and a Horchata.  As much as I want to come back, we are rarely in the area but now we know where to come in order to try the other tacos in the menu. It seems that some of the dishes sells out throughout the day so come early if possible.   Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Look for the hole in the wall with the most basic white sign reading \"Mexican food\" in black letters. It's hidden in the middle of a 10 year long construction project on a tiny one way side street.  Found it?  Great!   Get ready to experience the best tacos in Toronto's West End and the former City of York, possibly in the whole city. I don't know if it's the shell, the sauces, or the meat/fish but they all work together to form a delicious little package.   Can't go wrong with 3 for $10 and the decor inside is pretty cool."}
{"text":"This place was hard to find at first, kinda like a hole in the wall type thing. The outside says \"MEXICAN FOOD\", not the name of the restaurant. The place is really small so not like a dine in setting, just stools and bar type seating. The food was excellent, they make their own tortillas which I loved. Check their Instagram page coz sometimes they have deals where they give free tacos with your order. Only tried the tacos this time  but will definitely come back to try the rest! Flavors galore!! So so good!"}
{"text":"This place is so cute! Yes its a small place, seats 6 people and can get stuffy with the cooking but its worth it for the tacos!!! I had the fish and shrimp, and both were amazing! The fish was flavourful and the avocado salsa made everything taste better. So definitely try this place. They have hot sauce but I found it to be just a red sauce and not spicy at all and my spice tolerance isn't even high, I consider Frank's hot sauce spicy, I would have preferred a little kick in the hot sauce while devouring the delicious tacos."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall with limited seating and it was a bit of hard to find to the location because of construction happening in the area. However that made this adventure even better.  I went to high school in this area and it has the reputation for excellent Caribbean and Portuguese delights but this Mexican joint is amazing. Well done and friendly service. The 3 for $10 is an amazing offer. It is at the NE corner of keele and eglinton by the dollar store.  The fish was amazing. I am definitely going back!  Thanks"}
{"text":"Small owned shop located in the eglinton/ Weston area. Came in on a Monday lunch and it was quite empty. When walking in, the first thing that came into mind is \"am I in someone's kitchen?\" It does not resemble anything like a restaurant. Be aware that seating is limited so not great for a huge crowd. They do have a special of 10$ for 3 tacos. If you were to buy individual tacos they cost on average 3.75$ for one.  We decided To try the fish, shrimp, chicken and chorizo. My favourite of the 4 was def the shrimp! They use giant shrimps and the flavour was SOO flavourful. The tortilla are all made in house as we saw them kneading the dough as we ate! The fish was good but I'm so use to seven lives tacos that it is not even comparable. Size of the fish is more on the smaller side though. Chicken was good with the different toppings (such as cilantro avacado sauce) and the chorizo was unique as it was wrapped in a casing. Overall the tacos were good but it is far from where we live and I don't think I will be returning as regularly as I wish I could. Hoping they would move closer to our area as they were talking about it!"}
{"text":"Went through traffic and rain to get here, but it was worth it. The guacamole was very good, with a more liquidy feel and strong lime taste which was good. Highly recommemd the steak and shrimp tacos. The meat was top quality and clearly prepared well. One of the best mexican places Ive visited in Toronto for sure."}
{"text":"Probably the only place to eat scratch made Mexican food.  Awesome is the Word!!  Great attitude..no non sense..  Just great Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Food was so delicious!! I had barbacoa and fish tacos..it was delish.  The place was small and hot and you drink after because they don't have good ventilation..but you're there for the food so it's ok!"}
{"text":"When I stepped into this restaurant, there was an authentic vibe that is undeniable. So hidden and tucked away this place, I really wouldn't have looked twice unless I was walking by it by chance.   I really loved their tacos (though steep at 3.75/taco, but you get what you pay for) because it tasted so different from all the other Mexican restaurants I have tried like El Trompo. They were not dry at all, and there was a lot of attention, love, and care put into prepping our food. The fish taco wasn't overly deep fried so you tasted more of the fish meat. It was very soft to the chew. The al pastor straight up had a roasted small pineapple slice in there, and it was just godlike. All of them were unique from each other and delicious.  Bonus to yelpers! If you check in here you get a nice bag of free chips with $5 and up on your order. So incentive incentive! I love this place, and I will probably be a regular. I highly recommend visiting because the staff are so lovely and warm, just be warned there isn't too much of a sitting area. (other than that, it is also a great place for takeout!)"}
{"text":"Real deal. Homemade tortillas and you can tell the difference. In Mexico, civilized humans know that a taco or taquito is just that, a little purse of food, cute, pretty and delicious. Up here peeps think that a taco comes in a yellow box or has to have 4 lbs of food loaded into it.. where inevitably the thing falls apart and you make a big mess. El Nahual and it's friendly owner Luis know what a real taco is.  We had fish, shrimp, carnitas and barbacoa... all were tasty and prepared ready to eat without having to glob on huge amounts of salsa which disrupts the balance of the perfect little taco.  There's parking in front, fresh juice in the fridge and I will be back a lot. SL and the rest of the bloated hipster tacos downtown should come for a seminar to Luis' joint."}
{"text":"This is the best Taco place in Toronto hands down! The flavours are great, I tried the Yucatán , Mole chicken , shrimp and also fish. My favorite was the Yucatán chicken and shrimp. They are 3/12 or 4.50 each. Its small place and does not even have a board which says El Nahual - it says Mexican food outside . The taco's are delicately and carefully assembled- the cilantro, cabbage - all topping are cut to perfection .. I definitely think there are lot of regulars who come here , I for one will probably never eat Taco at any other place. It's quite a drive from downtown but well worth it!!!"}
{"text":"This is my go to for tacos and burritos in the area. They change their menu on a monthly basis but I think the tacos and burritos are always on it."}
{"text":"Best tacos in the city.  Rivals Cali street tacos.  Simple menu.  Limited seating.  What a find!  Thanks Yelpers!!"}
{"text":"Two guys and tacos should be the name of this place. They make the fresh bread and you can taste every ingridiant indvisualy. Beef and shrimp tacos are the best."}
{"text":"This place is supsr close to home and amazing on the pocket book.  Food is very tasty and reminds me of Mexico :) The owner is such a nice person. The food was prepped fresh and omg the  cheese sauce is home made heaven!!!"}
{"text":"The store front could use a facelift, but this place makes simple yet amazing tacos for a great price!! It's hard to choose a favourite, but I think I would have to go for the Al pastor (the pineapple did it for me)"}
{"text":"This place is hidden away small hole in the wall and with very little seating. We went there late at night and most of the menu items were sold out. We ordered three steak tacos and some quesadillas they came with nacho chips and guacamole dip. The tacos were bursting with flavor, the quesadillas were delicious. I love this place, the stools are unusual but if you eat here you stool won't be"}
{"text":"Just WOW. Amazing food, amazing service and amazing architecture! Beautiful small hidden gem. My friends and I ordered 3 steak tacos, and 2 burritos. It was honestly the best burrito I have ever tasted in my life... there was so much flavor. The rice in the burrito was  the rice wasn't too hard and it wasn't too soft. The meat was delicious and fresh. The presentation of these dishes were simple and beautiful as well. He also gave us large chips with guacamole and that was the best sauce ever!! I love this place and the owner is very humble and awesome!"}
{"text":"One of the best taco joints in the city! Had the fish, carnitas, tiger shrimp, and chorizo tacos~ All were freshly made (including the tortillas) and tasted amazing! :) Their chips were really good as well! Definitely coming again!"}
{"text":"hole in the wall in the middle of no where - literally.  but wow! shrimp and fish tacos are totally delish with a hibiscus drink. 3 tacos for $10 is quite an awesome deal. totally enjoyed it, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and well presented.  Corrected a friends misunderstanding of good Mexican food.   Love the atmosphere and feel of the place."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! I lived near this place basically my whole life and I just recently discovered it after searching for \"tacos near me\". It's a small little place, it's not much from the outside but don't let that fool you. The food wasn't the only thing that was amazing here, the prices! 3 tacos for $12?! (you can also mix and match) portions may seem small, but it is very filling! I tried the fish and chorizo tacos and the chorizo chilaquiles! Probably the best tacos I have ever tried! I can't wait to bring my friends here!"}
{"text":"Impressive taco joint in hard to find off the beaten path location. Food here is top notch, probably the best tacos/burritos I've had in the city. They are a steal at the price they charge. Food is great, atmosphere is rustic and modern, and the staff are excellent. High recommend"}
{"text":"This place is sooooo good!  Just like the tacos we had off a food truck in Mexico.  The owner is super nice!!! Tried all the tacos on the menu and all were equally delicious and all at a fair price!!! This place will definitely be on el hubby and I's places to go eat rotation!!!"}
{"text":"never disappointed when i have a taco craving .. tbh i crave his fish taco all the time! definitely my favourite place in the city. his prices are so reasonable (3 for $12) , of course since you're not really paying for the dining but the authentic flavours and ingredients!   discovered this little gem when i was around Yorkdale, craving Mexican food. the owner, Luis, is the nicest guy, he's so happy and appreciative of all his customers. he asked right away my first time here and was super helpful with selection since he has so many choice (some of them were already sold out by mid day) and since then he recognizes me anytime i go! it's a very small hole in the wall so not exactly dine in friendly if you're with a big group, although there is enough room to stand and inhale his amazing tacos, it really won't take you long. his fish tacos are unlike any i've had in the city, very very lightly breaded, topped with his Sala and a housemade avocado drizzle, with the freshest ingredients! i can never just have one! everytime i order it's 2 fish tacos and 1 i haven't had, i've tried the al pastor and the barbacoa - both were amazing but i am loyal to the fish taco, you must try it for yourself. i promise it's not anything like seven lives but it's so good in it's own way - i would say they're not even comparable since they're so different. ps. always get the salsa and chips to start - his salsa is an avocado salsa with homemade chips and ask for his hot sauce on the side. the only suggestion i would have is to make a hotter sauce haha, everything here is mild so that's the only down side.   anytime i'm in the area, i always stop by! but i find myself craving it more often than i should."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic! Everything is made fresh and from scratch. My partner and I go here very frequently for the tacos. Regardless of what you order, the flavours are well balanced and delicious. Our favourite place for takeout you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Best tacos I've had in the city for far, the staff is very friendly, the two Japanese girls are super nice :) will definitely be back for more"}
{"text":"What a gem! Almost scared to spread he word! Don't want to ever have to wait in line but these guys do it right! Tacos are so fresh and just perfectly made. All taco toppings are tasty and original with variety of meat chicken fish seafood and veggie. We had the shrimp the mole chicken the Barbacoa and the fish. Couldn't decide which was best! Rather than the standard multiple soft taco pieces you get one thicker one which works better! and homemade! Quesadilla also great! Rice drink and guava drink that they make also went really well with the food. We both ate so much for little cost. Will go back soon! Maybe next week!;)"}
{"text":"We got the 3 tacos for $10 - fish, chorizo and shrimp. The fish is definitely my favorite! Great hidden gem on eglinton."}
{"text":"Seriously great tacos here! The first time I went was not long after they'd opened for business and it took a while to get my order, despite being the only customer at the time. They make everything fresh to order, including the tortillas, so I wasn't too disappointed about waiting.   On my last visit, I was with four of my coworkers on our lunch break. There were a few other people in the restaurant as well, so I worried it might take too long for our food - I had a meeting to get to, so I was keeping my eye on the clock.   To my pleasant surprise, the food was coming out quickly. Since all five of us had ordered the 3 tacos for $10 special, they basically just made one of each order at a time, so we could all start eating at the same time. By the time we'd finished our first taco, the next one would be ready. Great system.   I had three different tacos: fish, carnitas and chorizo. It's hard to pick a favourite as they were all fantastic, but most everyone in our group raved about the fish tacos. The batter was so light and crunchy, and not at all greasy. But I'd take any of them again in a heartbeat.   The guys working there were super friendly and really quick to keep things moving along. The restaurant itself is very small, with only about 6-8 stools available to sit down to eat. Not super comfortable, so it's not really somewhere you'd want to spend too much time.   I'll likely get takeout next time. Maybe a burrito..."}
{"text":"Great tacos! Unassuming little joint, just off the main drag.  Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Had the chance of trying this place out last Fri night. I gotta say hands down one of the best places for Mexican food in TO and one of the best hidden gems in the city. Don't let the location and the size of the place fool you. This is an absolute must for foodies and especially those looking for a great Mexican joint. One of the guys at the front was super friendly and easy to talk to. Tried the fish tacos and the quesadilla and felt like it was the best fish tacos and quesadilla I've ever had in my life. Everything was well made and had all the right flavors. Very reasonably priced for the quality of food that your'e getting. I'll definitely be coming back and trying more food."}
{"text":"Holy Guacamole! They have amazing tacos and for the price of 3 for 12 dollars! You absolutely can't go wrong!  It's a small place that can probably seat up to 10 people! The staff are super nice!   We ordered all the tacos on the menu except the veggie one... 'cuz duh, we ain't vegetarians over here!   All of the tacos were amazing in flavour and presentation! My top 3: fish taco, carnitas, and el pastor!   We wanted to try the black tiger shrimp but they were sold out!   The chips and guacamole are different yet amazing! The guacamole was not chunky and had a strong taste of fresh lime and cilantro!   I am obviously coming back for the shrimp"}
{"text":"This place is top notch. Everything is made to order (including the tortillas), and the fillings are high quality, gourmet and delicious. Best tacos I've ever had."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this restaurant while searching for lunch before heading to Yorkdale. The restaurant is quite small, more of a takeout joint and seats about 6 people. The restaurant is very hot and humid and there was only one fan facing the window. There is free street parking (depending on the time), however there is paid parking directly in front of the restaurant.  We ordered the 3 for $12 ( Black Tiger Shrimp, Fish & Carnitas tacos). The food was flavourful, however it didn't hit the spot for me. We also took advantage of the free chips and salsa check in offer.  Overall, nice presentation of the tacos but I wouldn't be going out of my way to come back to satisfy my taco cravings."}
{"text":"I think this is my favorite taco spot in the GTA. I had stumbled upon this place when it was mentioned in a forum and after seeing the 5 star reviews here I decided to trek over to Keele & Eglinton.   Tucked away in the side of a small building, the tacos here are outstanding. We ordered 6 tacos to share: fish, carnitas, al pastor, steak, chicken yucatan and chicken mole. Every taco was full of flavour but the standouts to me were the fish, al pastor and steak, some of the best I've had so far. You also need to try their hot sauce, flavourful with just the right kick. We also took advantage of the yelp check-in offer for chips and salsa, the chips were light and crispy and served with what I believe is a guacamole cilantro sauce.  We loved the tacos so much that we ordered another 3 tacos to go - carnitas, chorizo and barbacoa. The only ones we haven't tried are the black tiger shrimp which were sold out and the veggie taco.   The staff are really friendly and accommodating. Don't forget to ask for the wifi password if you are dining in. Although it is a 30 min drive from home I cannot wait to return as the food made it well worth it."}
{"text":"Note:  This restaurant is more for a quick bite / take-out.  Although I really wouldn't recommend that you wait too long as I don't think the tacos will taste as good!  Tacos appear to be small, but they really pack a punch in terms of taste!  I ordered 3 tacos/$12:  Fish, Yucatan Chicken, & Al Pastor.  All of them tasted distinct, with different toppings, and were visually appealing as well.  They looked as though pride was taken in the presentation of the tacos!  Very good and I was actually full after eating them.  Initially, I was doubtful when I saw how petit they were.  :)  Parking:  \"Restaurant\" is located on the smaller, north side of Keele Street.  There is PAID angled parking just in front/across the street.  During my visit, there were plenty of street parking (paid) on Eglinton itself.  If you're eastbound on Eglinton Ave W, it can be tricky to turn left onto this small street as the street is very busy / undergoing construction.    Atmosphere:  El Nahual is quite small.  There is only counter seating for 8-10ppl.  Stools are solid, but they look like crates turned on their side, so they're not very comfortable.  Again, this is why I said that I don't think this place is intended for dining in for an extended period of time.  It was really hot out when I came in and they kept the doors open.  It wasn't super uncomfortable, but it definitely will be if it was more humid.  Service:  Girl at the counter was very friendly and nice.  Note that the food does take a while, so DO NOT come here if you need to be in/out.  After I ordered, the girl said that tacos would take 15-20mins and that was pretty accurate.  I would definitely come back to try out other tacos &/or even get a burrito, but for now, only if I was in the area as it's quite congested and Eglinton is really messed up.   Free chips w/ creamy guac with Yelp check-in!"}
{"text":"La comida es siempre deliciosa!  Truly a hidden gem!  They have a great variety of authentic Mexican cuisine. Eat in or take out.  Their sauces are made in house, served with chips. Great prices, and the ambience is very welcoming and cozy !  Staff is always sooo kind and attentive!"}
{"text":"Had their tacos, burritos and nachos and everything was amazing. Very authentic! Love this place and reasonable prices"}
{"text":"Best, most authentic Mexican tacos, chips, etc in Toronto. Fresh tortillas make this place a highlight. The shrimp tacos were the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Awesome legit tacos! There aren't many down to earth taco joints in TO! Wish this place was a smudge bigger! Only has about 6 stools to eat in, more like a takeout place! Taco shells seems homemade! Nice and thick enough so the filling doesn't leak out causing a messy, yet thin enough to hold everything together! Their fish is nice and crispy yet batterless! Can't wait to come back to try it all! Come early, things get sold out quick! Everything seems to be made from scratch!"}
{"text":"Small place but amazing and authentic Mexican food. Needs more signage but definitely needs more recognition!! Keep up the good work & yummy food"}
{"text":"Love this place! By far the best shrimp burritos or tacos I've ever had! Yummy and that's greenish white sauce is sooo good."}
{"text":"After eating a lot of great tacos in San Diego, the Toronto taco scene left me... a little sad.  I tried a fair bit of downtown spots and each was not even as good as the average decent spot in SD.  Well, turns out the best Toronto Tacos are NOT in Toronto.  They're in the suburbs.  Between El Nahual and Ay Caramba (Vaughn).  I think I picked up my 2 best authentic Tacos in Toronto so far.  As I said in the Ay Caramba review, a Toronto 5 star taco is probably a 4 or 4.5 in other places around the world.  BUT for Toronto, this is as good as it gets.    Ay Caramba and El Nahual are very different and good in their own way.   If you want to feel like you're welcomed into someone's home in a nice clean and decorated spot... Ay Caramba is your spot.  If you want to feel like you're stepping into a tiny taco stand spot just off the streets in San Diego, El Nahual is your spot.  El Nahual flavours strongly reminds me of the Baja Mexico style that I liked a lot in San Diego.  The place is tiny.  We're talking only 6 stools at most and there isn't much more room other than that.  It's clean but very very sparse.  You're not really there for the atmosphere.  You're there for the food!  Service here is quiet, polite, and efficient.  There's really no interaction.  Prices are very fair.    As for the tacos... I want to say their grilled shrimp taco is just as good as I remember in San Diego.  Really.  They don't double wrap their tacos but that's ok.  Ay Caramba really brings the heat up in their sauces and tacos compared to El Nahual.  I think they're more of a central Mexican style with chillis playing more of a central ingredient.  El Nahual is more focused on on variety of ingredients in the taco but lets the natural flavours shine instead of dousing it with too much sauce.  El Nahual's hot sauce is quite mild... I would dare say super mild.  Grilled Shrimp Taco - This is the real deal.  Baja style where the shrimp is cooked tender and still have that juicy bounce as you bite through.  It's wrapped in the crispy grilled garlic cheese that just compliments the shrimp really well.  Topped with cilantro, cabbage, and a tiny bit of onions, it's more of a nuanced flavour instead of super bold.  The avocado salsa adds a creamy texture that contrasts the crisped cheese. This was so good and shrimp were plentiful and a good size.  5/5  Al Pastor - The large chunk of grilled fresh pineapple was the nice sweet flavour contrast to the rich pork that has been roasted with chilies, spices, and achiote.  Similar to the Shrimp taco, it had the drizzle of avocado salsa, cilantro, and a tiny bit of onion.  I found the pork super tender and the grilled pineapple had the right sweetness to it.  4.5/5  Carnitas - Another great pork taco but this time, it had a more meatier pork taste as its was braised slow in it's own fat.  Even more tender than the Al Pastor... if that is even possible.  I found this very flavourful and liked how they used pickled daikon to break up the richness of it.  4.5/5  Veggie - I loved this one and I think it's cause of the crispy cheese!   The crispy cheese almost became a second taco shell as it curved around the cooked mushrooms, peppers, and onions.  There was a good flavour of umami from the mushrooms.  The addition of the pickled carrot and daikon was nice... could have used more for my preference but overall, very good vegetarian one!   4.5/5  Before I forget, you can check in for a freebie of chips and dip.  The dip is super mild in flavour (avocado salsa?) but the chips are a good crunch to get you hungry.    I was completely surprised on the flavours and how authentic it was to my memory of San Diego and Baja style tacos.  I think this is a hidden gem in plain site but seeing that it has a growing number of 5 star reviews, you can't keep a good place down.  If you love tacos, skip the downtown spots and head north... you'll find Toronto's best there."}
{"text":"Found this spot off of yelp earlier this afternoon and bookmarked it. After I got the okay from my sister and boyfriend to try this place out for dinner we were on our way. It is a bit hard to find, it is tucked away on a one way street but regardless we made it here with no problems. We were the only customers here and we waited about 15 minutes for all of our food to be prepared. Everything was prepared freshly and we were not disappointed. My sister is a picky eater and she loved the quesdillas, steak taco, and the chips & dip she ordered. My boyfriend and dont any meat so we were happy that there were options for us. The food was simple, delicious, and cooked perfectly. We will definetly be back!!!!"}

{"text":"Delicious tacos at a fair price point. A hidden gem waiting to be discovered by all! I got the three most popular tacos, carnitas, chorizo and fish tacos and they were mouth watering yummy! Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Try any taco on the menu and you will not be disappointed. Authentic, flavourful, and the tortillas are made fresh to order. A little hole in the wall spot that is worth supporting."}
{"text":"Amazing ... best tacos ... went for the first time tonight and will most definitely be back. Such a gem!"}
{"text":"Simply amazing! The handmade tortillas are the best. Friendly staff, fresh food, amazing prices. You must come in and support this local business!"}
{"text":"Still keep coming back! Awesome authentic Mexican food made fresh to order! Everything is good and he batch cooks to control quality so if they run out of something you will have to pick something else. That is how good their turn over is! I have brought family members here to eat and no complaints."}
{"text":"Favourite new discovery; hands-down best tacos in Toronto!! Just discovered this place, a short drive from home--bit of a hole in the wall--I never would have known about it had I not searched Yelp for Mexican places in this very, very specific area! I got my order in just after another huge order was placed, so there was a bit of a wait, but boy, was it worth it!! The staff worked hard to get everything ready and I walked away with a sampler of nine tacos (everything except for the veggie option). Each one was absolutely delicious and perfectly prepared; they also held up on the drive home--the taco shells are homemade, thick and sturdy, fresh and delicious. I also sampled their tortilla chips (also homemade and delicious!). Prices are also extremely reasonable, which makes me even more grateful for this humble gem... Will definitely return, time and time again! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This (almost) secret taco spot in west Toronto is all about the flavour. It certainly isn't a go-to spot for anyone wishing to linger over a meal, since stool-top bar seating is limited to 8 or 10 spots. It's the tacos that are the stars. Barbacoa, carnitas, fish, chorizo--all simple and delicious, with house-made tortillas and arbol salsa. A little slice of Mexican heaven."}
{"text":"This place is great! However it's paid parking and spaces are limited. So try to go when it's a less busy time.  The food was amazing! I had the fish, carnitas, black shrimp. The tortilla itself is made from frozen dough and cooked on the grill! It was so soft with a bit of corn flour taste to it. My favourite was the fish taco... the sauce was delicious and fish was very tender and melted in your mouth."}
