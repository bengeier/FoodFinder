{"text":"Since I work in 3 Gateway, there's no better option for a quick pick-me-up or a mid-day meal.  I've visited the Gateway Cafe about 5 times and plan to continue trying their timely, tasty creations.  I'll start with the bad - the caesar salad isn't a great buy, considering the salad is 40% crouton and usually is composed of some less-than-fresh lettuce.  The portion is reasonable, and the price is great, but the end product is just a bit subpar.  To the good - the breakfast sandwiches are tasty!!  Real eggs, cheese, and meat, all cooked to order.  Who knew??  Not a bad price at $3 and a quarter!  Lots of drink and snack choices for those needing a caffeine surge or other boost and some of the friendliest and most gracious people around.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Nice people, excruciatingly long wait. It should never take 10 minutes to get an under toasted English muffin. Won't be running back any time soon."}
{"text":"Hi thisis  one of the best places in the area I always been there in the morning and I enjoyed the tea here it is my favourite place in this area when I go to the work in the morning I always take the tea from here"}
{"text":"Well I think they have acclimated to the increase in people in the building since my last post.  I rarely have a wait and they know me by name. LOL.  The staff is always good for a little harassment."}
{"text":"Really did not like it here at all. Food was not particularly great either. I ordered a Ruben sandwich it had a weird aftertaste. I will not visit this place again."}
{"text":"2nd time there, and still such  very disappointing place. everything is way over priced! 1st visit I got a meatball sub.. the bread was very hard, and where it was sitting on the bottom it fell apart when you took a bite! nothing special, and 2nd visit I got the 1/4 angus burger, well it was a horrible mistake getting that! it was way to hot, and it was microwaved! the cheese was overly melted, and someone of the patty was hard, like it was nuked to long!! I ended up throwing it away! and it was over 7.xx for 1 burger!!!! never eating here again!!"}
{"text":"Well, I broke away from my norm which is the lunch lounge across the street in the 501 building to see if I could get a little change, don't get me wrong, the lunch lounge ROCKS! five stars!!! but I wanted to venture out & heard about this place from some co-workers. After waiting 15min to order???? another 15min for my food & Oh BTW having to repeat my order to the girl, I finally got my ham sandwich. The bread was stale & chewy, this was on a Monday and I'm assuming made with old bread left over from the Friday or week before, the ham tasted so processed, and cut a lot thicker than I'm use to? My chips were passed their best eaten by date and the staff just seemed real quite and not so upbeat? I'm going to save my money, walk back across the street and go back to the lunch lounge! their line may be longer for good reason, but I've never waited more than 3 or 4min to place my order, and never more than 10min to get my food. True it takes a couple more minutes to walk across the street, but the Food & service offsets the time, and the staff makes up for that with their fresh, friendly, upbeat attitude! So take it from a true professional foodie, save your money, take the trip across the street, and enjoy some real fresh, home made delights!"}
{"text":"My go to place for coffee and quick bites for most days :)  It is conveniently located on the first floor of Park Place Corporate Centre (the blue-tinted building where Adrak Indian Restaurant is!) It is a small cafe that serves coffee, snacks, and quick bites. The father-daughter duo who runs the store were always welcoming, friendly and personable. They also seem to know regular customers' orders by heart ;)  I usually order a medium coffee which is $1.50 tax included. You can choose the regular coffee blend or roasted hazelnut blend. The hazelnut one is my favourite, and it smells so heavenly ^^  For lunch, I usually get a freshly made sandwich for $4 tax included. The portion is huge (for me!), you can add sliced tomatoes, cucumbers, lettuce and other toppings at no additional cost. My coworker and I usually enjoy the egg salad sandwich, tuna salad sandwich, and chicken salad sandwich :)  Secret menu item (well, not so secret anymore!) Beef patty ($1.50 tax in.) is not on the menu but you can certainly order it. I always have random beef patty craving moments lol. You can also have it stuffed apparently! My coworker was telling me how delicious a stuffed beef patty was lol. You can stuff it with the usual - sliced tomatoes, cucumber, plus other favourite toppings. I shall order that another time ^^ Not sure how much it cost but I'm sure it can't be too far off.  This cafe also serves a specialty Indian hot dish everyday. I often hear them offer butter chicken served with rice for lunch (I think around $6 or $6.50... can't rmb exactly).   Huge portions with great affordable prices. I'm definitely a happy returning customer :)  P.S. Hours of operation - Monday to Friday from 8am to 3:30pm - mainly during office hours."}
{"text":"Amir and Naz are super friendly to everyone that walks through the door. They always have several choices. You can ask what their daily special is as the menu is always changing. My favourite is the stuffed patty; it's so delicious and filling! It's toasted to perfection and you can choose three ingredients to stuff it with. My go to combination is tomato, lettuce and peppers. They also have sandwiches, bagels, soups and salads. I'd also recommend the French Vanilla to start your morning. :) It smells and tastes amazing."}
