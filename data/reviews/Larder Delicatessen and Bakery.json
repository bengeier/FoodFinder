{"text":"Gave it a try and while they obviously put a lot of time and money into the place, this is basically a hipster Jewish deli. No smoked sable because they have only freshwater fish (a fact about which they are quite adamant, as hipsters are wont to be). Lox made with trout, not salmon. Matzo ball soup made with beets. Huh? The food quality was good but this is not your father's kosher deli, but it is your hipster nephew's kosher deli."}
{"text":"Come for the pastrami, stay for the chocolate phosphates and pastries. Phenomenal food and service!"}
{"text":"Happy to have this new business in the neighborhood, everything we have had so far - the rhubarb pie, cabbage salad, chocolate cake, pastrami sandwich and by far my most favorite the stuffed cabbage with mashed potatoes wow. Excited to keep trying everything they have to offer.
Update - their french fries - so good!! And the brownie is by far the best brownie I have ever had, it is perfect. I've gone back 4 times just for the brownie!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a whim after a class at Harness Cycle, and whoa! I was looking for a challah and thought I'd give theirs a try, it's one of the best that I've found in Cleveland! I resisted buying the babka because it looked too delicious, but I may not be as good next time"}
{"text":"My dad once told me, \"Son, if you want to be successful all you really need to do is find a need and fill it.\" Easier said than done, but the team at Larder has done just that, opening up a delicatessen and bakery in the ever-growing neighborhood now known as Hingetown. 

Ohio City and the surrounding neighborhoods have been desperate for a place to stop and grab a quick lunch with quality food. Larder had answered the cry. 

I stopped in today for a quick sandwich on my way back to the office from a meeting. I was greeted by one of the three chef/owners, Jeremy, with a pleasant hello and a friendly smile, thanking me for stopping in. 

The menu board is clear and concise. Another thing that I really liked about Larder. They know what they are, and they do it well. No need for an extensive menu. They have a couple sandwiches, including pastrami, a daily catch, and a daily \"w√ºrst.\" Other offerings include matzoh ball soup, pickles and assorted pickeled vegetables, divine looking sweets, jams, and even a mini market with milk and other pantry items sold you need something in a pinch. Great for local residents. 

I tried their pastrami on rye and it was a great sandwich. Chunks of smoked pastrami, deli mustard and red kraut. Not over stuffed, but a reasonable sized sandwich. Perfect for lunch. 

Larder has hit the mark and has filled the need. According to my dad's logic, Larder can do nothing but succeed. If they keep serving up the quality meats with their fast and friendly service, I'm sure Larder will do just that. Welcome to Hingetown!"}
{"text":"Needed to check out Larder and see what all the buzz was about and yes Larder is as good as advertised.  Located in half of an old fire station located in Hingetown across from the Art Museum's Transformer Station Larder is packed with excitement.  Outside there are several picnic tables with more tables inside.   Inside I was struck how well done the decor is; a combination of memorabilia from firestations and culinary decor.  The deli counter and bakery items are right in the center spotlight with an open kitchen behind.  If you look carefully you will still see the fire pole and the spiral staircase to the second level.  While this is a new restaurant it feels like it has been there for decades.

The menu is tight and compact, with almost as many specials as there are regular items.  The menu varies depending on the season and what is available; everything is made from scratch and the culinary skill shines through.  The menu board is clear and easy to get through; I was more fascinated by the items displayed in the deli case.

Over 2 visits I tried two sandwiches that were both excellent.  First I had a daily special fresh catch that was whitefish and egg salad sandwich; truly an excellent meal with maybe the best eggsalad I have ever had.  Of note was the excellent quality of the lettuce, tomato and bread used for the sandwich.  The second time I made my own sandwich with a container of smoked fish salad from the cooler and some bread I ordered; even this simple sandwich was superior.

On my second visit I also tried an order of bread pudding out of the cooler; while good I prefer my bread pudding to be a bit sweeter and moister.  This dessert was good, just not what I was looking for.

Larder describes itself as a Curated Delicatessen and I think that is a great description, the decor, menu and food are all carefully picked.  The result is a really superior experience.  Larder should be on your must try list."}
{"text":"Really wonderful place. I've been able to try their Pastrami Sandwich, Fried Chicken Sandwich, Chocolate Babka, Root Beer, and a number of their sides. Everything -- seriously everything -- has been delicious. *applause*"}
{"text":"What a great addition to Cleveland! The fried chicken sandwich was so good as were the beets, stoner bar and choc chip cookie! We had a great lunch outside on the patio! They even had a high chair for our sweet girl to people watch and enjoy the scene. Love it !"}
{"text":"Impressive quality of meats, fish and veggies. They smoke meats in house and making a lot of internationally influenced salads by the pound. They also make homemade shrubs & sodas, like my blueberry vinegar shrub. So. Good. I got the catch of the day sandwich, which was a white fish with pickled red onions, lettuce and potato chips on soft, white pillowy bread. The vibe is so cool because it's in a renovated old firehouse. For fans of artisan pickles, smoked meats, good people and garage door seating. 10/10"}
{"text":"I stopped into the new Larder Delicatessen and Bakery today and loved it! Located in Hingetown in Ohio City, Larder brings a super cool flair to the neighborhood. Larder is in a converted firehouse that was built in the 1850's. The environment itself has a really cool atmosphere, with a carefully curated old-school-Cleveland-meets-homey-deli-vibe. Is that a thing? I'm saying that's a thing.

Larder is many things, but they are most definitely a:
+ Fab deli with an interesting selection of meats
+ Cool, ethnic bakery filled with eastern European treats 
+ Spot to grab organic/local eggs, milk, homemade jams and a pantry with nuts, beans, salts, etc.
+ A place to grab a great meal or sides freshly made

To me, they really fulfill a need in Hingetown for providing the long awaited grab-and-go action. I took home a fried chicken sandwich and it was honestly the best fried chicken sandwich I've ever had. The chicken was so tender and perfect and the breading was heaven. I was so torn on what to get for lunch - ask about their daily specials (they also had a white fish salad that sounded yummy). The menu has a cool selection of sandwiches, sides, and you can even do a meat board with meats, cheeses, pickles and bread. I really want to come back again and try one of these fantastic sounding boards! 

Larder is an awesome addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Wow pretty blown away with this place. Homemade, fresh food. Plenty of delicious veggies. Cool atmosphere, great location. Helpful staff. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This place is a block from where I live and it is amazing.  I go several times a week and the breakfast sandwich is what dreams are made of!!  Great service and friendly owners."}
{"text":"Found this great deli when I was exploring the neighborhood. Was the perfect spot to stop and have lunch. I was planning the next half of my day.  I ordered a pastrami on rye($12). It did not disappoint. The meat was amazing.Their sides which I did not order looked delicious too.

It's in a old fire house. The front doors roll up to enjoy the beautiful weather. There were benches out front to sit as well."}
{"text":"I've been hearing a lot of hype about this place opening up so I was very excited to come here. I love the look of the place being that it was in an old fire station. Its very open and they have seating inside and out on their patio. We were greeted very warmly and encouraged to ask about all the items they had. We ordered matzo ball soup, chicken sausage, a turkey ruben, and dill potato salad. The matzo ball soup was ok. I think it was more because I wanted something that tasted more like chicken broth and I think they use something like pickled cabbage in their broth. The chicken sausage was amazing and you could definitely tell it was homemade by the texture and taste of the meat. My turkey ruben was good as well with pickled turnips instead of cabbage which was a nice touch. My favorite by far was the potato salad. I really have a hard time finding a potato salad I like that's not too creamy and they nailed it. I also like all the extra dill they put in their. I plan on heading back to try out their liver pate and some corned beef in the future!"}
{"text":"So far, so good! Went in today to check out the new spot. I think it's a great addition to the Hingetown lineup! I got the special, a fried chicken sandwich, and just in time. As I waited for my order, it got 86'ed (around 1:30pm, so it was a late lunch). It was pretty dope! The fried chicken alone was juicy and well seasoned, but the bread was unexpectedly really good too! Maybe I should have expected it since they are a \"deli & bakery\". I don't know what kind of herbs were in it but it was great! Got a side of pickles veggies (carrots, cauliflower, celery, onions) I think they were calling it \"Hungarian\" veggies, which I liked.

In any case, food did not disappoint and I'm eager to try the pastrami sandwich and other sides - potato salad, sauerkraut, pickles, lots more - and some baked goodies! Only drawback today was the seating was full, so I took mine to go. I think this problem will subside once it becomes nice enough to eat outside."}
