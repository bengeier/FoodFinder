{"text":"I must say, I was really impressed with this place when I first walked in. It has a super cozy, hipster atmosphere and the windows let a lot of light in.  There is comfy seating in the corner with pillows as well as a nice bar table by the window.  I was surprised that they sold hong kong milk tea here actually. I was not expecting it. It was a nice surprise. For $3.50, it's a fairly decent price. Plus, it's a good size and served in a cute mason jar!  I'm not sure if it ever gets busy here, but the seating in the corner is pretty limited, and the tables are a little close to each other which might not be great if you don't like sitting too close to other people.  But other than that, I really enjoyed this place! The workers are all friendly and the atmosphere is great. I will definitely be coming again, and many times after that!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem.  Hong Kong milk tea and vietnamese ice coffee is legit!  So happy to have found this place."}
{"text":"Just like Fairgrounds, more expensive than competitors despite being in worse area that should have lower rent."}
{"text":"I usually don't write bad reviews,  but the mocha I had  tasted like nesquick and my friend had gotten a matcha latte that tasted like flavorless cup of grass in warm milk."}
{"text":"Close by, convenient and pretty cool inside. I've been driving past this location since moving into the neighbourhood wondering what the heck this unnamed business was with a wooden sign. Finally, Yelp helped me to figure out that the unnamed spot was in fact, a coffee shop named the Black Goat Cafe.  As others have mentioned, it's very small. Maybe 3-4 bar stool seats and perhaps 2 tables. The wifi is free and there are some plugs if you plan on plugging in your device so you can get some work done.  Despite having A/C running it was crazy hot in here and definitely limited my desire to stay any longer than I had to - perhaps it'll be a cozier place by winter?  I didn't get anything fancy, just a green tea on ice to help cool me off. I think it was a standard tea bag, nothing crazy, definitely not anything that can fairly help me build an opinion on this place. With that said, I'm starting them off with a 3 star A-OK and will try their coffee before I give them a boost up or down."}
{"text":"Pulled pork burger, salmon and cream cheese bagels, super good cookies (chocolate chip is the BEST but Oreo cheesecake is good too), and amazing coffee options.   The food is very cheap, but the drinks are overpriced. They also say the close at a certain time- 7pm on weekdays, but if you go around 6pm, the employees have already stored everything away, and you can hope they get you coffee at least, because they don't always."}
{"text":"I stopped into Black Goat Cafe on a Tuesday afternoon for a quick pick me up. I had a mocha with almond milk and a day old cookies & cream cookie. It was decent, but I found it to be a bit pricey as I spent $6 on a small (maybe 8oz) mocha and a cookie from yesterday.  It is a cute spot, and I would stop in again once in awhile but probably can't afford to be a regular here :p."}
{"text":"The girl working today doesn't know how to make a cappuccino! Ordered and she made a latte, asked her to remake it and she tried giving me back the same exact drink with literally a spoon on foam on it. When I told her she was like\"oh did you want me to remake it?\"  I told her yes and she made another latte, left the cup on the counter and didn't even tell us it was ready.  Then she said that her cup won't let her make a cappuccino? Seriously? we waited over 30 min for 5 drinks. Don't waste your time, just not worth it today.  Hopefully they actually train the ppl that work there."}
{"text":"My new favorite local cafe. Their HongKong milk tea and ice tea are authentic and taste great. The cafe is cozy and clean. Baked goods are all made in house. Chocolate Chip muffin is very filling. Eat one and you are pretty much good for the whole day. Would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Here's the problem..  If you want to do sandwiches/be a restaurant and still operate as a coffee shop; get 2 people as staff.  Waiting 12 minutes for a latte is (first world problems...) ridiculous. High maintenance couple needs their sandwiches cut in half, waiting for toasting, etc... Painful.  What's nice about take out coffee is its a SHORT TERM stay, or at least u hope so...  The employee is super nice (blonde) and it's not her fault. Having sandwiches is cool, ready made sandwiches or make the leap and hire more staff.  The location adds to the area (boring). Wouldn't return for coffee, more headache than anything.."}
{"text":"Tried the iced Hong Kong tea and loved it! Would definitely come back again. Great customer service and lots of street parking available."}
{"text":"Not perfect, but the ambiance here was enough to make me fall in love. Located in Etobicoke/Long Branch area, just west of Kipling Ave and Lakeshore Blvd. West, this place has a super inviting feel, very welcoming, rustic (some of the furniture looked straight out of a Restoration Hardware catalogue), and friendly service.  We visited on a Saturday morning and it wasn't too busy. Street parking was $1.00 per hour. We were battling a minor flu bug and instead of coffee, we ordered: a) the HK Milk Tea, b) HK Lemon Tea, and c) a banana chocolate chip muffin.   First, the drinks. They have a pretty extensive menu (see menu attached). It looks like they specialize in making the drinks we ordered cold - but because of our flu bug, we asked for it hot instead. Not sure if this is how it should be, but the drinks were so-so. The HK Milk Tea was nice and sweet but the HK Lemon tea tasted like regular black tea with lemon. Nothing too special. However, I will definitely be back to try their actual coffees instead.  Second, the snacks and baked treats. I was totally blown away by how delicious the muffin was - it was so moist and fresh, the chocolate soft and melted at the touch. Normally with these coffee shops, I end up with a pretty dry pastry outsourced from another shop. But Black Goat Cafe makes everything IN-HOUSE and it actually tasted that way!! It was so delicious! I'm definitely coming back and trying the rest of their baked goods.  Lastly, the atmosphere and MUSIC. I found myself Shazam-ing basically every song that came on. Great vibe, a nice place to do work, peaceful and quiet. There's not a lot of seating so perhaps best only for a pair or smaller groups.  We paid a little over $10.00 for 2 drinks and a muffin. I will definitely and certainly be back soon to actually try their coffee and other treats!"}
{"text":"I discovered this place while exploring the area. It's not very big and does not have much seating but has a really cool hipster feel. The girl working the counter that day was very nice and provided great service. However, none of that mattered when I noticed that my coffee was warm at best. If you can't go to a cafe and get a hot cup of flavorful coffee then what's the point. Unfortunately I will not be going back."}
{"text":"#Etobicoke #LongBranchTO Drop by Black Goat Cafe Mon-Sat 7am-7pm and Sun 9am-3pm at 3261 Lake Shore Blvd W (by 23'rd St) and try their home-baked pastries! The one pictured is Hello Dolly (pecans, coconuts, chocolate chip, graham cracker crumbs), their almond milk lattes are delicious :)"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and tried the mocha, oreo cheesecake cookie, and a chocolate coconut cookie. Everything has been delicious, especially the oreo cheesecake cookie - it's a must-try! My favourite thing about the baked goods is that they're not overly sweet. The flavours are enjoyable because they're not overpowered by sugar.  The cafe itself is clean and quiet. The owner, who served me both times, is very sweet.  The Black Goat Cafe is a wonderful addition to the Lake Shore!"}
{"text":"Delicious cappuccino and banana chocolate chip muffin, also tried the Oreo and chocolate chip cookies; all equally tasty! Very nice and helpful barista, comparable to Starbucks products with slightly cheaper prices!"}
{"text":"Great little coffee shop. They make you feel special every time, even though they don't write your name on the cup. Their specialty coffees will make you jolt and dance the Macarena all day at work."}
