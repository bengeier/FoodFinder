{"text":"Made the mistake of ordering food from here for an important occasion. The food was a disaster , how anyone can make and serve such horrible food is beyond me. The chilli panner was full of gravy and rubbery. The chillie chicken has pieces of boiled chicken in the same horrible gravy. The mutton curry was the worst i have ever tried and the noodles were full of oil and smothered in soya sauce.  Waste of money and time. Will never go again"}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoy their veggie samosas and other veggie meals. The restaurant has a very intimate and cozy feel. Service is fast and friendly. I look forward to my next meal there :)"}
{"text":"What a disappointment.
When this restaurant was the Green Chili, it was fantastic. Under new ownership and the new name, they obviously didn't keep the recipes or the cook! Too bad.
Bland bland bland. No flavour to anything and the food wasn't even properly cooked.
After I told the waiter that I was very disappointed, the owner came by to apologize, and even after telling him again what was wrong with the meal (we only ate about half of it) he still charged us full price. He gave me a $25 discount certificate for \"next time\". Why would there ever be a next time?
Terrible food and terrible customer service."}
