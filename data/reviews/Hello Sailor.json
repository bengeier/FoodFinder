{"text":"There is nothing not to like at Hello Sailor.  Those who know Kindred will recognize the commitment to excellence, especially in the friendliness, teamwork,  and attentiveness of the wait staff.  The sheer beauty of the renovated space was a thrill.  As a Kindred fan, I was surprised at how modest the prices are.  The creativity of the cocktails is a marvel.  We started with a deviled crab dip and were blown away by the flavors.  My wife had the grilled Caesar salad and I had salt and pepper catfish.  With every bite we celebrated that Joe and Katie Kindred chose this vaunted lakeside institution to build on their extraordinary Davidson success."}
{"text":"Had been wanting to visit this restaurant for a while, finally did and was disappointed. The retro decoration is great, very clean however the menu is very limited, small portions for appetizers. For example the crab dip is $12 and you get about half a cup of the dip. Frankly too expensive for the type of food you get in general. Service was good but don't ask for any variations or substitutions, you may be denied that."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, but the prices were exorbitant and the portions smaller than most restaurants. Not vegetarian-friendly (French fries only available cooked in beef fat and few menu options). Working out the kinks on the service, since it's new, but they have a long way to go in this regard. Nice atmosphere and great location; I hope they figure out the problems or I can't see going back."}
{"text":"So impressed with this place. The decor was spot on for the location on the water. The attention paid to detail in the furnishings and layout are great. Now the food...I've been 4 times and everything is fantastic. I've had Crab Dip, Lobster Roll, Ribs, Calabash Shrimp, Chicken Sandwich and it's all been great. Hush puppies!!!! Specialty drink menu is fun and offers something for everyone. Every time I've been I have seen families eating there, just like you'd expect at a fish camp. Joe and Katy Kindred have another winner."}
{"text":"I posted this on Google as well, but want to get the word out there, so cross posting my review:

We love Kindred, sister restaurant to Hello Sailor, and now- we love Hello Sailor too.  You can't expect to choose between siblings, but what I can say is Hello Sailor's menu is a bit more playful, but equally delicious.  The sunchoke app is to die. And the little necks swim in a broth that I would lick from the bowl, if left in private to do so.  

Very kid friendly, even if your child is hell bent on being as cheeky as possible.  The felt eye patch they give along with crayons and a coloring menu, would of looked better over her mouth, but alas I gave her my phone to watch some crappy show, and my husband and I ordered another drink.  Mummys and Daddys-  you know what I'm talking 'bout.  

Service is outstanding.  Place was busy at lunch, but our server was attentive, without hovering, and kept us updated as dishes were to come out.  I am stoked about this place, and really excited for the Kindred family.  They know what they're doin'.  I'll leave it here with two words:   SOFT SERVE! ?
Ok, & four more: 
GO HERE, LIKE NOW!"}
{"text":"Like another reviewer here, I really do want this place to succeed. I love Kindred. I know this place is neither Kindred or trying to emulate Kindred. But with that association I would expect excellence regardless of menu or target market. After tonight's experience, the former Rusty Rudder would be a 5 star restaurant by comparison. I would expect kinks and hiccups in a new restaurant. But this experience was awful and basic things like courtesy and communication (And water. And appetizer plates) were completely lacking. Most egregious was that our food came out one hour and 40 minutes after being ordered with no acknowledgement or apology. If that's how this establishment handles a Thursday night in 20 degree weather, the first nice day of spring may stop the world from spinning on its axis. The most concerning issue was that this seems to be a theme with the reviews thus far and I really didn't observe much leadership or management presence moving things along. Everyone in the building seemed entirely aloof with no one providing direction. I really hope there is a wake up call soon to get things moving on the right track. Quickly. I have every hope they will figure this out, but as of now there seems to be no logical explanation as to why it was so bad."}
{"text":"Not the best.  Kindred is better and so is Alton's which is right down the street.  The table was very shocked when they served the crab dip appetizer with wrapped captain wafer crackers.  Not really that great- maybe a better idea for burger and fries in the summer time via boat."}
{"text":"The new atmosphere is definitely different than  The Rusty Rudder. The Bar staff was friendly. The food was way to fancy for a \"lake come as you are\" atmosphere. There will be NO music at the Tiki Hut because..... so many excuses. They said boats can come to the cove and play music for the restaurant. WTF!!!!"}
{"text":"Service friendly and ready. Comfortable environment. Food scrumptious and looking forward to more. Crowd well behaved and clean. America is great."}
{"text":"Tried it twice. Very limited menu. Overpriced and not worth the money. We don't mind paying for good food but an example is carb dip with packaged crackers? Really? Ribs weren't that good! Gave it a chance unfortunately won't return. 
Ok"}
{"text":"Everything is perfect! Great food friendly staff and must go kind of place!! Would recommend to everyone!! Don't forget to try the hamachi! Way to go guys you knocked another one out of left field! #teamSailor #teamKindred #foodporn"}
{"text":"On a beautiful pre-Spring afternoon we were looking for an outdoor patio to enjoy lunch.  While the outside was occupied at Hello Sailor, we were pleasantly welcomed into their light, airy, indoor space. The ambiance has a carefree causal, yet elegant, feel. The menu placemats had a variety of offerings to please all.  The decision was the special of the day.  The Flounder.  And it did not disappoint. The light masa flour dredging coupled with the perfect choice of complimentary seasonings made every bite an insatiable desire for more.  Light, yet filling.  Thankfully, room for dessert allowed for the S'mores Poke cake and a vanilla swirl soft serve to put the finishing touch to a delightful lunch.  All this with the attention to detail and care, by our server, Jesse. Looking forward to a return visit!"}
{"text":"So I use to go to this location when it was the Rusty Rudder and wanted to see how its replacement was. The atmosphere and renovations are nice, way more classy than the Rudder (RIP).  The food was good but most definitely overpriced for the portions. I order a dish with pork belley, clams, and squid for ~25 bucks. Boy was I disappointed when It came out. The dish was so small and only came Al Carte so if I wanted sides I had to spend more. It came with two small pieces of pork belly, 5-6 small clams, and some little squid parts here and there. Now the food was good, not great, but decent. However I can never justify spending that much money on a \"snack\" here again. The only way I would return is if they dropped prices on these small dishes or added more to the dishes for example have it come with a salad/soup and side. I think then its reasonable for the price."}
{"text":"This restaurant is absolutely the best thing around. Creative and delicious modern dishes, kitchy drinks, and a super hip mid-century modern vibe. The Poke bowl (hamachi) is one of the best things you will ever put in your mouth. Real foodies and people who appreciate aesthetics will totally get this place."}
{"text":"Wow. Such a disappointment. Portions are terribly small and even worse, not tasty. I don't think I have ever had such a bad wedge salad. How does one even mess that up?  Had really high hopes for this place.  Maybe they will listen to the feedback and make some changes. Like, offer more than one brand of Chardonnay, train your servers to know call brands, serve a $14 seafood dip in something other than a super shallow 4\" wide ramekin (ie bigger portions--at least enough for two people to share an appetizer), re-evaluate your concept--comes off as hokey. Is this a fish camp or a dining experience or a quick cheap bite off the lake?  Pick one because your decor, pricing, servers T-shirt's and jeans are all over the place in concept-world. Best of luck!"}
{"text":"Server was nice but food options not appealing. Hard to find any non-fried options unfortunately. Cost was way too much. Not a place I am going to spend $30 for a lobster roll or go for a steak.  Waterfront = seafood so why not expand options to meet varying price points and well as some healthy options.  I don't see the lake crowd embracing this establishment.

Kindred is such a great restaurant so I know the capability is there.... I hope the several suggestions on Yelp lead to positive changes"}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had in Charlotte!  The atmosphere is great and the food on point. 

We tried a variety of items including oysters, hamachi, sunchokes/caviar, hush puppies, fried lobster wedge salad and shrimp platter. The cocktails were also very creative, well presented and actually great tasting. Many restaurants in the area fall short on their cocktail menu. 

This place competes with Charleston top restaurants and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My hubby, BFF, and myself checked out Hello Sailor this past Saturday as we wanted to show my friend some dining on the lake while she was in town.

We arrived a bit after noon and were able to snag a table outside by the water. My first impression was blown away. The decor was phenomenal and super inviting. Everything was just....cute, for lack of a better word! The tiki bar outside was a nice touch too. 

Drinks- We had multiple mixed drinks during our time. Unfortunately, I don't remember the names of any of them. I started with the drink in the fish cup. Super fun and delish. I also loved the pineapple mixed drink. All the drinks come in either fun cups or have fun decorations. I thought the drink prices were in a good range of about $9-11 each. 

Food- Unfortunately, the food wasn't a huge hit across the board. Prices were really high for food too. However there was some good. We started with hushpuppes. They were awesome and the butter with it rocked. I got the hamachi. Holy smokes this was so good. The crispy rice was super unusual and made the dish. The macadamia nuts were so flavorful. My husband got the fried bologne sandwich. I didn't try this but the fact that he left half untouched was a huge sign cause he is always a member of the clean plate club. My friend got the chicken sandwich and the pickles. The pickles were awesome. However the sandwich fell way flat. We all tried a bite and it literally tasted like nothing. Weird situation eating air. We all left wondering if the seafood options were the shining star....probably and makes sense. I think food is definitely an area Hello Sailor needs to work on to succeed. 

Service- Two words. Absolutely Oustanding. It took a bit to get food but that's ok when you have sunshine and a good drink. Our server was a rockstar. Close to the end of a meal, it started raining. Rain is an understatement....more like torrential downpour. He is standing there talking to us getting soaked (We had an umbrella over us) trying to make sure we were ok. The staff came out in full force outside moving people and putting umbrellas down from the wind.

Overall we will definitely come back as the atmosphere just took me away from city life for a bit. Super refreshing and relaxing."}
{"text":"Was not impressed. French fries on a plastic plate I ordered the platter number one which was popcorn shrimp and over cooked flounder, Service was not good. They really need to adjust there price point. My expectations were not fulfilled."}
{"text":"Clean with great views.
 Food was average for the price. Music was loud and not relaxing."}
{"text":"Love this place.  It's not the same concept as Kindred, people, so it won't be the same experience!  I think the sister restaurant may be the reason for the mixed reviews here.  We came at an off hour and were seated right away with a great view.  Cocktails were amazing.  I've just moved from San Francisco, Seattle and New York over the last few years and these cocktails blow my favorite places out of the water (pun intended).  Service was great and personalized.  When our server was slow to bring the two-person cocktail she comped it for us.  We meant to have only a few snacks but devoured a meal.  My favorite was the crudo, and the salad, which was surprisingly good!  We just moved to the area and will be back many times."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the food quality.  The remodel looks great.  I actually like the new look of the restaurant and bar.  They really opened it up and the lake views are amazing.  Took my mom there to try the food.  I've heard many mixed reviews so wanted to try it for myself.  We got there at 1:45 pm.  
We ordered the hush puppy and deviled crab dip appetizers.  For my main course I wanted to try the shrimp poy boy but the waitress informed me they were sold out.  I asked if the fried shrimp platter was available and she said yes.  I then asked if the shrimp for the sandwich was different.  She informed me they were out of bread and the homemade aioli.  I was disappointed already.  So I ordered the calabash fried shrimp and flounder with French fries.  The hush puppies were ok.  Nothing to write home about.  The deviled crab dip was so salty it was not edible.  We did not eat it.  The fried flounder had no taste or seasoning,  like eating cardboard.  The shrimp were just ok.  Again pretty bland with no seasoning.  Even the French fries lacked a bit of flavor.  I really wanted to like this place because it's one of the few restaurants on the lake.  Unless the chef or menu changes I can say that I will not eat there again.  $45 for an entree and two apps.  Not impressed at all.  I hope the owners can work on the menu and make it a better place."}
{"text":"Stoped @ Hello Sailor for lunch today and here's my experience:

Service, Melissa @ the bar was incredible, helpful and great to chat with.

Decor, this is one of the coolest vibes around, mid century modern with an incredible view... 

food, I had the Citrus crab Louie salad, probably the best damn salad I've ever had.

Drinks, very cool cocktail, beer and wine list, can't wait to come back and explore this more!

Verdict, if I could give 5 1/2 stars I would this place rocks! I will be back"}
{"text":"Fantastic night out with friends.  Be prepared to wait a little bit during hot times but it is worth it!  The absolute best hushpuppies and chicken wings you will ever eat!  Very good cocktails and beer selection as well.  Overall very unique and fun experience!  Their calabash style seafood is lightly fried and very good as well!"}
{"text":"Awkward service and way too loud of a space. Apps were good but avoid the platters if you don't like things fried. Meh. But probably a great place to get a beer and something to nosh on in the summer!"}
{"text":"I don't often write reviews but with that said this one is in hopes for this place to be successful in my local community. I can only give one star as I did not actually get to eat there last night. We tried to call to see how long a wait as they do not take reservations and found that they have no phone to call. We called Kindred(sister restaurant) and they confirmed you were open. Headed there at 7:30 to be greeted by a lovely girl with an iPad in her hand that now told us it was at least a 1-1/2 wait!! The place closes at 10. Needless to say we headed elsewhere and met several other quite annoyed customers as we were seated at Altons right down the road where we had a great dinner!! This all could have been alleviated if you had a phone or took reservations! Jury is out for me.. I will wait to hear reviews to see if we venture back to try it."}
{"text":"Goodbye sailor :(   The family and I were excited to try this new place on the lake.  Walking in, i was surprised by the mid century retro decor.  The interior seems strange for a lakeside restaurant.   
 
Draft beer list lacked  local offerings. Would rather see a local brewery showcased instead of pbr.  Wife ordered a Bloody Mary. She complained that it was too spicy.  I tried it, and can confirm.  After she complained to the waiter, he brought her some tomato juice  to try and cut the heat.  

Crab dip and French fries were good.  The vinegar taste in the House pickles was too strong and made us pucker with each bite.  

We shared some feedback with our waiter and handed him our signed checks before finishing our drinks to leave.  As we attempted walk out the restaurant, a few minutes later, we were stopped by the waiter claiming we forgot to leave our signed receipts at the table.  After explaining that we handed him the signed copies minutes ago, he checked his stack of checks and discovered our signed checks. He then responded \"oh, my bad. See you again soon\".     No, i don't think so..."}
{"text":"Ok so it is definitely not a Lake atmosphere restaurant. Not well suited for lake goers and weekend warriors. Lake Norman has Always had casual eateries to enjoy, no more, money dictates the cuisine and the dress codes and the food itself. Good food is good food, chicken, burgers and dogs on the grill, cold drinks and lots of lake people, that is going to be missed. Hello Sailor's food doesn't live up to the price.  It just doesn't work"}
{"text":"I had not heard one good thing about this restaurant since it opened in December, but I am one of those people that still need to go and experience it myself. And wow, we are so happy we did!! We had an amazing experience, great service and really good food. Our server, Amir was very knowledgeable of the menu and had great recommendations. We came on a Sunday early evening, it wasn't too busy yet. We started w Fresh raw oysters and king crab legs, so yummy. I had the scallops w the vanilla parsnip, amazing! My husband had the shrimp and flounder with beef fat fries, Also amazing. It's very kid friendly with a casual, yet cool atmosphere. Oh, and the cocktails are different and delicious. Needless to say, we were pleasantly surprised and really enjoyed it. Go check it out for yourself!"}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday. Though everything was good I wouldn't say awesome! EXCEPT WE HAD GREAT SERVICE. It's a little pricey $17 for a salad with shrimp that was good but $17 I don't think it was that great.  For $17 Bucks I expect wow! The atmosphere is great and the place is decorated well with an awesome view of the lake"}
{"text":"The food is decent. Ambiance is great, but the service is really terrible. Not sure if it was a fluke with who we had as a server, or if this is the norm - but waiting for an hour for a table, and then two hours for food while other tables come and go, doesn't quite seem right. 
I'd recommend to skip the wait and order at the bar outside."}
{"text":"After being on Yelp for 6 years, this is the first time I have ever been compelled to write a review.  Hello Sailor management please take note....I want you to be successful, but tonight's experience was an epic fail and needs fixed quickly.  My family and friends want you to get it right and the advice/observations below are being written with the full understanding and forgiveness that this is week one.
1) Please don't seat a party of 5 at a table meant for 4.  The corners are sharp...ouch.
2) EVERY table was using their cell phone to see the menu.  Either turn the lights up or make the print on the menu bolder please.
3) Plastic cafeteria trays meant for kindergarteners need to go.  Buying plates in bulk can't be that expensive.
4) Cheap plastic water cups and baskets are meant for the Golden Corral Buffet, not a waterfront dining experience from the owners of Kindred.
5) No vegetarian options.  The vegetarian person at our table made the mistake of eating fries cooked in beef fat (which was verified by the staff)
6) The bagged salad we buy at Publix to serve at dinner in a pinch was MUCH better than the shredded lettuce disaster (aka house salad) I was served.
7) 2 of the 4 mixed drinks our table ordered were beyond bad.  Our server tasted them and was embarrassed.  The bar got it right the second time fortunately.  Advice from the table is to nix the paper straws that fall apart halfway through your drink.
8) 2 options for desert.  Meat Pie or Soft Serve Ice Cream served in a paper dixie cup.  Hello Sailor charged $4 for the soft serve.  Jason's deli charges $0. 
9) Bright spots:  The hush puppies, clean bathrooms, chicken sandwich & nice wait staff.
10) Identity of the restaurant seems a bit confused at this point.  Pick a decade/theme and roll with it.  

There has been so much excitement for this place to open.  You have to get this right. We need a great place to go this summer.  Otherwise we will be better off eating PB&J on the boat."}
{"text":"First time this evening at Hello Sailor!  Will not return! Food was over priced and everything has Collard Greens on it or in it or on top of it!  It's. GOOD BYE SAILOR for me and all of my family"}
{"text":"I need to give this place another try. We can see it from our boat dock at our house so if anything the convenience is a big factor. We went in just for an after-dinner drink on our anniversary in early February. The bartender wasn't very friendly...weird vibe. I like friendly bartenders who introduce themselves and treat you like you're part of the family. Maybe I expect too much, but there are plenty of places in Cornelius where the bartenders and servers are funny and personable, so strike one. Not sure about the decor - seems like they're trying to mix too many things. We got the hush puppies even though we just ate dinner, because I cannot turn down a hush puppy! They were excellent Thought the drinks were a little on the pricey side, but they were good. Looking forward to experiencing the outside deck this summer, since we could easily kayak, park our boat or even swim over on our noodles! :) I know the owners have a great reputation in the area so will definitely give this another shot!"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant - can't wait til it's warm enough to jet ski over for lunch.  Great burger, fries and pickles.  My husband had the shrimp and was very happy with it.  The German chocolate cake was delicious.  Going back again this weekend."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying I LOVE Kindred. It's my favorite restaurant in the area. We had high expectations for Hello Sailor and unfortunately it did not live up to them. We went there last night and got a bunch of food- hush puppies, crab dip, chicken sandwich, lobster roll, avocado slaw, fries and soft serve. I can honestly say we did not enjoy any of it. The sandwich was undercooked - we had to send it back. Also, almost all the food was fried. Sadly, we won't be back. We will miss pulling our boat up to the Rusty Rudder docks this summer. Please Hello Sailor, change your menu - offer lighter options that aren't fried or too fancy esp considering the lake location. We would love to give it another shot."}
{"text":"Great food, service and atmosphere!  My new favorite place on lake Norman. Excellent wine, burgers and salad. Can't wait to try more of the menu. The hush puppies were amazing and I'm not normally a hush puppy fan."}
{"text":"The place itself is beautiful and the servers are knowledgeable. The food was fine, just VERY overpriced. I think it will do well this summer based on location alone. Nothing \"WOW\" about this place and I wouldn't recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"A chicken feather in our hushpuppies - yes, a fried feather. I have not experienced anything as disturbing in fast food joins! That's all we ate before leaving (thankfully) and what we ate of them (before we found the feather) was not good. 

I also ordered a Negroni slushy at the bar outside and was served a glass less than half full. When I mentioned it, he said they were out of their normal glasses. 

Upon arriving, we told the hostess we would take the first table available outside - there were at least 10 tables open and we had to wait....for feathered hushpuppies.

I seriously cannot believe this is owned by the same folks at Kindred! The view does NOT make up for the horrendous experience. This place won't make it. We definitely will never be back!"}
{"text":"Two of us ordered the grilled burger which was amazing (and you will never forget the delicious beef fat fries that are cut to shoestring size and perfectly crispy!) 

We enjoyed dipping them into the small ramekins of their homemade ranch dressing which was uniquely flavored with dill seasoning.

The server recommended their \"thick slab of bologna\" sandwich which had too much mustard for my palate and the person who ordered it was not a fan of the flavor of the bologna itself - which may have been related to our total unfamiliarity with this cut of sandwich meat cut so thick.

The staff was friendly and fast and the views of the sunset over the water simply spectacular."}
{"text":"I have tried so hard to like this restaurant because it is a short walk from my home and it's got such a great view of Lake Norman. It's just so hard to understand what the owners are going for with this place. Every local  I know is very disappointed with the menu and the place is so loud inside it makes it difficult to dine inside on a busy night. Stone floored, wood ceilings and windows with no thought of sound dampening. It's a beautiful day so I walk over and sit at the bar outside. Order a patron and soda and since their 3 salads on the menu do not appeal to me I order two $4.49 house salads, hold the bacon and an order of $6.99 shrimp upgrade with balsamic vinaigrette dressing. The outcome of this order ends up being shredded lettuce with boiled shrimp and a small cup of vinegar. I ate it and finished my one drink and this was the result.  $33.53 before tip. I asked the bartender if it was correct and she rudely said yep and turned and walked away. I wanted to catch some of the Wells Fargo golf tournament and there were no TVs outside but the bartender said they had two TVs inside. So I go in and the bartender says the TVs only show skateboarding videos. I cant stand to see anyone fail but I hope it happens soon since it seems inevitable. The place was 1/4 full on a beautiful 80 degree Sunday. What a waste of space."}
{"text":"Like many area residents, I really want this place to work, but it's not working yet.  First visit, a few weeks after they opened, I was not impressed. Decided to try again after four months. Went for lunch today and was even more disappointed. The menu is small. Fine. But if you're only going to offer a few items, then you have to really excel with those offerings. Sadly, that's not the case. If you are in the mood for so-so flavored food with a nice view, you'll be fine. Just remember you're paying a lot for that view, not for amazing food. If you want better food and an equally good view try North Harbor Club, Port City Club or Eddies. If they want Hello Sailor to work they have to get the food right. If they keep trying to force these limited, bland options they will struggle to survive the summer. One saving grace might be offering an alternative menu for lunch or at least at the outdoor bar area. A few more sandwiches, salads etc for the lunch and lake crowd will make a big difference. They can still be \"unique\" but more appropriate for lunch. Also some rotation in the menu or at least more vegetarian or non-seafood items would help. One final suggests: REDESIGN the ladies bathroom. You have to be under 5 feet tall or a contortionist to fit in most of the stalls. Spend five minutes in the restroom and every women who enters is saying the same thing. I really hope the owners listen to these reviews and find a way to alter their vision enough to succeed. We are all rooting for you!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Hello Sailor, and I am very conflicted about this review. We had a group of 8 visit and there was an incredibly long wait for a table. A group of 7 was seated ahead of us when the hostess thought we'd weren't there. However, we were at the bar and had been drinking and waiting. I found the majority of the special drinks to be sub par. The bartender serving us was knowledgeable and fun. She did not recommend any of the specialty drinks and I appreciated her honesty. The drink she ended up making me was fantastic. 

Once we finally got our table (about 60 min after we arrived on a weekday night), our server was ready to go right away. He was excellent and was incredibly knowledgeable about the food.

We ordered a variety of appetizers and they were overall very good. I found the king crab dip to be underwhelming, but the sunchokes, asparagus, and hush puppies were phenomenal. While waiting for our entrees, the chef brought out a few other appetizers since we had been waiting awhile for our table. They were also very good.

I ordered the platter with the calabash shrimp and black pepper flour battered black drum. The calabash shrimp was insanely delicious. However, the black pepper batter was much too thick and too tough for the black drum. I did not enjoy that combination. There is potential if the batter is thinner and the cook on the fish is more delicate.

For dessert, the chocolate cream pie was a little bland and the strawberry shortcake ice cream pie was clearly a frozen item. The frozen shortcake cookie was mushy and lacked flavor. However, both desserts were beautiful and really could become amazing menu items with some changes.

Overall, there is a lot of potential here for a beautiful restaurant that is just seemingly missing the mark to get a very positive review. For the price, I expected a bit more quality. Our server was just fantastic, and he was the reason I wasn't disappointed with the visit."}
{"text":"For a restaurant less than four months old, Hello Sailor meets all expectations for a second offering from the award-winning Kindreds. Fabulous combinations of food and drinks, your choice of four types of seating (indoor, covered patio, sun patio and...opened this week...a tiki bar), boat slips so you can boat right up, and of course a gorgeous view of Lake Norman. Note, though, this isn't the place to take starving teenage males whose idea of gourmet is three burgers (although Hello Sailor burgers are amazing) or two extra large pizzas. Many other places available to fill those guys up. This IS a terrific place to relax and enjoy wonderful tastes assisted by smart wait staff who know their menu. Have to haves: their light-as-a-feather hush puppies, the crab dip, and their hand pies (crust recipe should be classified a national secret!) Another great Kindred addition!"}
{"text":"Retro Palm Springs mid century modern vibe. As with Kindred, lots of attention paid to the aesthetic, which I love. Lakefront view, lots of light, though it is boomy inside. More of a cold season problem- I expect the warm seasons is when this place will really shine. Crab dip, beef fat fries, Cole slaw, NC catfish and shrimp were all super good. Only weird things were the Lance captains wafers for the dip (retro? Maybe. Def not made in house though.), that the catfish, which you need to cut, came in a basket, which was a bit awkward and messy, and the lemon curd hand pie... lemon curd itself was good, but pastry was too greasy and sugary. That said, all in all it's a great start and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food is way overboard for a lake location. Will not go back. Location is nice. Two stars for location. Change the menu before word gets out about the food."}
{"text":"Considering my boat sits in the water 100 yards from the deck I so badly want this place to succeed and be my next hangout.  It's not looking good.  The beers and drinks were decent and appropriately priced.  The interior was ok, but nothing special.  The menu was awful  I had the Calabash chicken sandwich, which was caked in mayo.  It reminded me of a McDonald's mcchicken, which I honestly like more.  My girlfriend, who is a vegetarian, couldn't even eat the fries or hush puppies as almost everything (if not everything) is fried in beef fat.  The avocado macaroni salad was the best thing we ate.  The prices were fine.  But could we get some fresh fish tacos, a fish sandwich and some vegetarian options?  And stop frying everything in beef fat.  It doesn't taste any different and limits the few things a vegetarian can eat.  Also $5.00 for the photo booth???  That's a little nuts don't you think?   Please adjust the menu.  Everyone we spoke to agreed (even some of the staff).  So much potential yet so much missing.  

Also those that posted 5 star must be friends of the owners.  There is no other logical explanation."}
{"text":"People may write poor notes about this restaurant, they want it to be something else...
Great service, it is. 
Great place, it is !
Each dish considered for what you ordered, was good. 
Paper menus... keeps the casual atmosphere that the location must have, plus they can change, if needed. 
Maybe more menu items? 
But really, see you this summer!! 
Can I buy season tickets??"}
{"text":"Visited the place with a group of 6. Without reservation we were seated in 20 mins on a Sat night. Ordered drinks and appetizers. Oysters on the 1/2 were good. Main course was lame. Unappealing and not presented Well. (I had shrimp and flounder). Seems like a good place to drink."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch yesterday with two girlfriends who were equally disappointed. We ordered one of the restaurants signature drinks \"sea legs\" to start. The description on the menu and the waiter are what sold us on giving the cocktail a try. I am by no means a snob when it comes to drinks...usually if I'm not too crazy about a drink, I can still finish it. This one, I could not take more than a few sips. The after taste was so bad, it made the drink unbearable.  It tasted like how an old musty basement smells. If you try it, you'll know what I mean. 

The concept of this restaurant is overall very confusing. Are we in the retro 70's Brady Bunch type of place serving fresh expensive seafood dishes after a long day of being on your boat with family? or are we a chill hangout place where you come for  cheap fried food when youre drunk after a long day of being on your boat? Even the name is weird. Hello sailor? Is the owner a 85 year old couple or is this place going to be a modern gay bar?

The food was overpriced, the menu was extremely limited,  and almost everything they offered was fried. My friends ordered the calamari sandwich and I opted for a \"healthier\" option and ordered catfish and avocado slaw.

The waiter informed us that they just \"ran out of the calamari sandwich and just delivered the last to a table\" after they had ordered. They opted for the chicken sandwich instead. Cant go wrong with a chicken sandwich right? Wrong.

Again, the chicken was fried...is grilled an option? Whatever. It had zero flavor and the only thing that made it edible was some dill type sauce that wss served with it. The fries werent bad. I would have preferred a chicken sandwich from Wendy's.

The catfish. It came out fried in a basket and the avocado slaw was thrown into a plastic bowl.

When the food was brought out i exclaimed, \"oh this is fried?!\" If everything is fried you need to put that on the menu. I saw where options were calabash which I knew was lightly fried, but that was not written on the menu for several of the fish options. You can't just assume that everyone knows that everything served here is fried.

We also got east coast oysters (half dozen) for $18. They were OK but not worth the price. As we got our oysters, a table next to us got a 40oz (of beer) served to them on ice.

What is this place?

The waiter was very nice and in no way was anything his fault, but overall the concept of this place is extremely confusing, the menu is limited and in no way descriptive, and the food is WAY overpriced. 

This place is not going to survive. Especially during the summer. Pick a concept and commit to it.  Expand your menu. Get a chef and bartenders who know what they are doing. Lower your prices and serve burgers and chicken tenders and fries or raise the quality of the food that you're serving. If anyone comes here and rants and raves about anything about this place, its bullshit. Bring the rusty rudder back or save your money and go somewhere nicer on the lake."}
{"text":"I don't think the prices align with the food quality and having to eat on disposable plates etc.  Not a great variety on the menu and food is way too salty."}
{"text":"This dining experience was so disappointing. On a beautiful May evening we arrived by boat around 6:30 pm. We had called for reservations but were told they didn't take them. The wait wasn't too bad but the noise level was horrible! Honestly, it was just a din of noise; could hardly hear the person next to me. The food was pretty decent but not outstanding. The serving of avocado slaw was so miniscule it was tacky! Needs another overhaul."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  Would have given a one star but I am giving the benefit of doubt since they only recently opened. Hopefully it will be better when their outside dining opens this year.  Food is mediocre at best. Service was ok but not what you would have expected   The calabash seafood platter was reminiscent of captain d's .   If I go back I will bring a magnifying glass to read the menu"}
{"text":"Example: of a terrible restaurant where apps come out before drinks, and entrees (well to be fair, one entree...Lord knows where the rest we're) before salads. But don't worry, you won't be able to eat it anyway because you'll have no untensiles. You would think that with such horrible Service some damage control would be in order but there was no manager or extra attention to make all of these glaring errors right. We just told them to keep their food and left. Oh btw this magical experience comes at the low low price of 160 dollars. 

Avoid at all costs. Please I implore you."}
{"text":"Love the decor. Very Palm Springs and photogenic. 

We only stopped in for drinks and an app-- the Judy (bourbon drink with grapefruit, honey, and thyme) and the Spritzer (vodka lime juice drink). Both were delicious, but I preferred the Judy. 

As for the apps, we split the beef fat fries and the clams. The clams were addicting and we ended up asking for spoons to come as close as we could to drinking it (they offered extra bread but we refused due to an allergy). 

We sat at the bar and the service was good-- granted this was at 4pm and was pretty slow."}
{"text":"The food was good...people complaining about the fried food don't understand this is a play on a fish camp. Rockefeller was great, hush puppies are delicious, and our platter were tasty. My ribs were a bit dry but they were the last 1/4 rack of the day so likely had been sitting...sauce was good though. The shrimp was great and the fries have good flavor but we're a little crispy for our liking. 

However, the portion sizes are very small for the price and the menu needs to be revamped based on the other reviews online if this place wants to survive. You can't live on publication and \"professional yelper\"(lol) reviews alone...they aren't your average diner who will frequent this location. Noise is ridiculous. I know you probably want to keep the wood paneling exposed but you need some sound boards....badly. 

Good idea but poorly executed. More research should have been done on the demographic that will keep this location alive...even a wealthy lake population won't keep you afloat if you want to be stuck between a cafeteria and upscale location. Figure out your identity and roll with it, right now I think the owners tried too hard to be \"innovative\" and instead just ending up confusing people."}
{"text":"When the McAllisters and taco Bell have better reviews on google than your restaurant, you might have a problem.  

Service was slow, food was average at best, and seating was crowded and noisy.  Very underwhelming. 

This restaurant has an identity crisis.  Is it going to be upscale dining, or pub grub?  The prices were too expensive for pub grub, and the food was too slow and mediocre to be upscale dining.  

Kindred should cut ties with this place."}
{"text":"Excellent food, service, and atmosphere! The time and attention to the menu and decor is impressive. This is the place to be on the Lake!"}
{"text":"Had dinner on 3/2/18 - The decor was great. Loved the mid century modern feel. However, the restaurant was too bright and way too loud.  The menu was very limited and the prices on some of the meals were way over priced. A lot of the options were fried. Would have been nice to be able to get something broiled. When I inquired about this the waiter said no changes and no substitutions.  I've never been to a nice restaurant that would try to accommodate their customer a little bit.  The crab dip app was good and the seared tuna was ok but as far as the rest of the meal...it was less than average and way over priced. The Cesar salad boats were sinking in all the dressing and I Could have gotten better catfish at a fish camp.  Not to mention, I shouldn't be eating off a school cafeteria tray while spending that kind of money on dinner.  The drinks were ok but nothing to write home about. Was very sad about this experience because I LOVE LOVE LOVE Kindred and every time I come to town I always try to go eat there.  Don't think I will feel the same way about Hello, Sailor."}
{"text":"I've tried the restaurant twice now and I loved my meal the first time around but it was way over priced for lunch ($32)! However, there isn't a lot to chose from if u don't eat fried food. The second time around, I bought my husband and we were both very disappointed. Neither one of us eat fried food but my husband didn't have a choice w the chicken sandwich. He asked if they could serve it grilled but they said no, only comes fried. It was so over cooked and salty that he didn't eat his meal. I got the scallops the second round and they were good but again way over priced. Plus, I left hungry since they don't give u a lot of scallops. 
Overall, they need to have more options for people that want to eat healthy and stay away from fried foods."}
{"text":"The greatest part about this restaurant is the atmosphere and decor. It truly makes you feel like you are in Palm Springs but somehow also with a lake outside of the window and not the desert. They decorated to the nines and it is such a cute place to take pictures.

The place was super crowded when we came in and we had to wait which is totally cool. We went to the bar and got cocktails which were pretty good. They were your standard \"fancy\" $14 cocktails and came in really cute glasses.

My friend and I both got the chicken sandwich for dinner. I think being in the South and putting a fried chicken sandwich on the menu means you need to deliver. The sandwich was so meh and average. Tenders down the road, Chick fil A, Haberdish, etc. are way better than this (and I didn't mention fast food joints to be flippant- I have a high amount of respect for the Chick-fil-A sandwich and Tenders). It was honestly not worth $11 which isn't even that much.

Service was overwhelmed and not very attentive. It took a long time to get food, not really many water refills, never asked if wanted another cocktail. I will give this place another try and hope they can redeem themselves. Maybe next time I will go with seafood."}
{"text":"This place should be called HELL NO Sailor. 
I went back and decided to give this place another chance.  I got the oysters (one of the only things on the menu that isn't fried) and got soooo sick the next day.  
I thought it may have been a fluke, but my dinner companion was over the toilet that entire evening as well.  
Fool me twice, shame on me!  I'll stick to Port City."}
{"text":"Tried the new restaurant despite some of the recent reviews. In short, wasn't a fan on several fronts. The atmosphere is fairly bland, but extremely loud. The wait staff was courteous, but not attentive to drink refills. The menu is definitely fried seafood slanted. There are other items, but my party ordered the fried food. Wait time between order and when food arrived was almost 30 minutes. Waiter apologized once for wait, but didn't seem authentic. We ordered two orders of hush puppies as appetizers. 4 hush puppies per order!  Not sure what the recipe was for the hush puppies, but they were not good. Had some sort of salty flavor that wasn't what we expected. The entrees finally arrived. Portions were not very large. Flounder and shrimp platters were hot, but flounder was small. Fried shrimp was okay, but only as good as Showmars fast food. Catfish basket not served with any side. Had to pay another $3-$4 for side. Total bill $100 for mediocre at best seafood. Not sure i will go back in the summer on boat unless it were just for drinks. Guess they are going for an upscale Fish Camp. If I wanted fish camp, many other choices with better food and overall experience. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"This is quite the disappointment knowing same owner by what has supposedly become one of the premier restaurants in the Lake Norman area.  First bad experience was being told after 3:00 pm on Mother's Day it was walk-ins only as it was reservations only prior. We got there at 3:30 and it was suddenly reservations only.  No apology or attempt to accommodate.  Words were \" oh you were misinformed\".  Second disappointment was the salt and pepper catfish probably the worst fish and al a carte at that, that I've ever had and at the amazingly ridiculous price of $14.99. That fish wouldn't have passed for a $5 basket at a food truck.  What a waste of a prime lake property in Cornelius."}
{"text":"The lobster roll was so light and served on the amazing milk bread from Kindred. Everything we had was delicious - even the chicken wings had a unique flavorful take. The interior has modern, hip design elements and nice lake views. 

I was initially deterred by the lower Yelp rating, but after going I feel like most people are just mad that the restaurant type changed from the prior restaurant (no longer a lakeside dive). This is definitely a more upscale fine dining experience, but the food is definitely worth the price!"}
{"text":"TRULY AVERAGE.....
We have tried to like this restaurant but after 3 visits I doubt there is a fourth in our future. 
Positives-Cool decor, pleasant skilled bartenders, good service and the tuna appetizer.
Negatives-very few truly good food options, OVERPRICED for the taste and quality, loud."}
{"text":"The View of the harbor was the best part of our lunch experience.  The menu is very limited. The food was pre prepared frozen. Grossly overpriced for poor quality food. Service was adequate.  Large DISAPPOINTMENT."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this adorable Peninsula spot! The decor and view are breath-taking, food is to die for, and the service has always been fab. Whether it is a slow Monday evening or a bumpin' Saturday afternoon, this place is worth stopping by and waiting for a seat. Keep it up, Hello Sailor. Don't let the haters bring you down!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the new decour and the mid century vibe. The young man waiting on us was absolutely outstanding, the service was excellent. My wife and I were pleasantly surprised how delicious the appetizer was, but were even more excited once our dinner had arrived. The food was cooked to perfection, the portions were perfect, and the entrées were mighty delicious I must say.  I'm giving it a 4 1/2 stars. The only thing I would like to see would be a little bit more finger food appetizers that we can order and eat when we arriving by boat this summer."}
{"text":"great service, great food, great atmosphere !! it's super cute and very unique !! while most people were expecting something very different, i think hello sailor exceeds expectations !! people are afraid to vary from the same old \"dining experience\" or whatever. branch out ! try somewhere fun and cool like hello sailor ! there isn't a single restaurant in our area that has the same vision or vibe that this one does."}
{"text":"This place is terrible and even worse service. Not to mention the vibe in the place is weird. I tried to order a Pina Colada and they don't even have an Oasis machine. That entire place needs some serious help. Way over priced"}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday around noon. We were seated right away outside under fans despite how busy it was. Decor was casual and cool- the view was perfect. Ordered hush puppies, kids burger and fries, cheeseburger with avocado slaw and chicken sandwich with fries. Everything was great! Service, food, atmosphere, all hit a 10. The butter that comes with the hush puppies was my favorite- spicy and sweet. We will be back again!"}
{"text":"Whew, not sure where to start. When I first started working on the lake, the Rudder was for sure a very different and amazing spot. I celebrated many milestones in my life there with close friends and will forever cherish that. Unfortunately, that error came to an end, and I'm so proud of the new establishments owner's, drive, hard work and TALENT throughout this new open.

Now let's get to the important part... food and drink. I haven't eaten red meat in almost 3 years and had a few bites (too many according to my hubby who wanted to eat it himself LOL) because it was THAT good. High quality meat is truly what I'm looking for everywhere these days. But, so far my favorites are the WINGS, the Calabash Chicken sandwich that is soaked in pickle juice/type brine for 3 days, and the Tuna Poke (just try it, I have no words). I've yet to try an item I didn't enjoy. Even the Caesar salad was good the NEXT day, and I do not usually partake in too many leftovers.

I also don't drink liquor and try to stick to beer and wine, but dang, that Olde Fashion is one worth talking about, along with a few others I just had to try. Looking forward to 40's (shared bucket style) on the deck, laughing with those same ol' good friends with a much improved view. It's amazing how much more opened up it is! Gives a very cool feel and definitely brings you back to that old school fish camp style (the baskets, plastic water cups), and the funky Palm Springs lighting, amazing staff and renovations are such added FUN.

Hey 'Nelius, we could use a lil more hip ;)

I know I hear a lot of mixed feelings because it is new and different and people don't like change, but hate to put it out there, Lake Norman has been nothing but change since I was a small child growing up on this lake. At first it was changing for the better, and then it really started changing for the worse, and I saw it first hand- especially  back in college and after I graduated and moved away and heard the stories etc. from friends and acquaintances... but now I wasn't seeing it back change for the better, once I returned home. I am NOT hear to point out those downfalls, but to just LIFT up this new beginning. Trust me, I know Joe is too much of a perfectionist to be stopping ANYTIME SOON on hearing your feedback and wanting to make this place great for this community.

Let's all support local. This spot is 100% worth trying and couldn't be more locally supported and locally born. If it's not your cup of tea, plenty of places to go, but nowhere like this one, and that in itself is an incredibly strong recommendation. Give it a try, I personally look forward to being a frequent visitor.

Cheers and look forward to enjoying the tiki hut after a long day at work this summer!"}
{"text":"My friend Jenn and I went to Hello, Sailor for lunch. Hello, Sailor is the newest restaurant from the folks at Kindred and most people will tell you how life-changing Kindred is as a restaurant. I only like the bread and dessert at Kindred so I really wasn't looking forward to Hello, Sailor. So much so that several of my friends had asked to join me there and I said no. But Jenn and I had a change of plans one day for lunch and we were suddenly left trying to figure out what to have since neither of us had brought lunch as a back up. We were going through the list of normal places to go and nothing sounded great. Jenn then suggested Hello, Sailor and I thought, \"well... why not?\"

Keep in mind Hello, Sailor is is pretty focused around seafood which isn't my favorite. I was pretty convinced that I'd end up with a burger even though I didn't want one. Instead, Jenn convinced me to try the Calabash chicken and she ordered a lobster roll. To start, we went ahead and ordered some hush puppies.

Before I get to the food, let's talk about the restaurant. You know in \"Mad Men\" when Draper heads to California? Yeah, that season threw up and is the decor of Hello, Sailor. I like it. I like that it took me mentally to \"Mad Men\". But it also has terrible acoustics, which is brought up a lot on the Yelp reviews that currently exist. Also, our waiter was very interested in sharing every single detail with us. Even after I said yes I wanted the dessert. Alas! I had not yet heard every minor detail of the hand pie so even though I'd said yes, he continued explaining it to me. I found that a little odd, but my experience wasn't ruined because of it.

Anyway. 

I don't love hush puppies. But I did love these. I've actually been thinking about them since I was there. They weren't as dense as others I've had and actually had some flavor.

Jenn loved her lobster roll. Which I was super stoked about because it's what everyone wants there (except me) and I would have been disappointed if it was bad. I didn't try it, I just trust her judgment.

My chicken was amazing. Perfectly fried. The right amount of seasoning. So many damn sesame seeds. But I wasn't upset by the seeds, I just made the same amount of mess as a small child.

I also had the hand pie of the day: bourbon pear. I added vanilla ice cream and Jenn had chocolate ice cream sans hand pie. The hand pie was absolutely delicious. The ice cream was fine... just mostly hilarious at the baby spoon you get with it. Jenn asked for a normal spoon instead and naturally that spoon was larger than the ice cream. I still giggle about it.

All in all, I'll be back to Hello, Sailor. Now, if I could just also get milk bread there from Kindred I'd be even happier!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience. Our server was amazing! She even wrote a hand written card saying thank you for dining and to come back. The drinks were great - I'm pregnant and because of this I obviously can't drink, so the bartender made me a mock-tail that was delicious. The food was tasty - I highly recommend getting their ice cream sandwich. It was incredible! Not sure why there are so many bad reviews. I thought it was great!"}
{"text":"Best Old Fashion we've ever had. This place has come a long way from the Rusty Rudder days. Beautiful inside with a great view of Lake Norman. Saw Dale Jr. there last night, so this is the place to see and be seen. Friendly staff. Haven't tried the food yet but I'm sure it will be good."}
{"text":"Branding and interior 5/5
Service 2/5 - we went at 6 pm on a Saturday and it was super slow. The restaurant was busy but it's surprising that they weren't prepared to accommodate the crowd. Also they ran out of lobster rolls before we got there. 
Food 3/5 - the crab salad and the hush puppies were good! The fried seafood platter was average at best.  Definitely expected more out of the menu from the Kindreds. 

If you're on the lake and want an average dinner it's a great find. I wouldn't go out of my way again for it."}
{"text":"I was very pleased with our experience.  I was not sure what to expect because of the mixed reviews here.  Our server, Bernadette, and staff were very attentive.  I tried the hush puppies, wings, calabash chicken sandwich, fries-all of which were really good especially the wings and the chicken sandwich-super yummy!! 
My entree was the grilled caesar topped with shrimp which was really good!  I would definitely come back and it will be interesting to see what summer brings to the restaurant with the great patio space!"}
{"text":"On a gorgeous spring day that I took off from work, I wanted to eat outside. Hello Sailor can help you with that! I saw that the tiki bar was open for the season as of 4/19/18 and I wanted in on that. I really was going to see what drinks they had but we met friends for lunch as well. My husband and I waited for friends and both ordered a Cooking With Gas tiki drink which is rum, orgeat (almond syrup), lime orange curacao and bitters. It hit the spot. 
For lunch we shared the beef fat fries which were small like frites but not as crisp as I love my fries, Great flavor though. We also got the grandfathers pickles which might have been my favorite thing I got there. I got an order to go even. Still have some in my fridge. I'm hoarding them. They have chilis in them so they have some kick. The brine would be good in a bloody mary I think! I got the calabash shrimp which I thought was a generous portion and it came with a nice homemade tartar type sauce and my husband, the catfish, which was a nice golden brown. He paired it with the roasted broccoli which was also a good amount. My friends got the shrimp as well as the Chicago style bologna sandwhich. Lots of poppy seeds! He polished it off. 
For something sweet, because it was warm, I got a frozen painkiller with a floater of Captain Morgan on it. That did NOT disappoint.
I would like to eat inside in their gorgeous mid-century space. Don't try and compare this to Kindred because you really cant. These are two different spots. Bring some friends and relax, chill at the tiki bar or grab some shrimp."}
{"text":"I love sister restaurant Kindred and now I love Hello Sailor too! They have done it again. The food, the drinks, the service, atmosphere and decor are all fabulous. Everyone needs to remember this is not Kindred, it a different restaurant, which has been done perfectly.

We ordered the hush puppies (perfectly seasoned and melted in your mouth), smoked wings (such good flavor and the sauce was great), clams (the sauce was amazing), lobster roll (perfect flavors and not too much mayo is always a plus), calabash shrimp (somehow they managed to make fried shrimp light and tasty) and the calabash chicken (this may seem like an ordinary chicken sandwich but it is anything but-it is a must try).

I can't wait to go back with another group and try more dishes on the menu. I know they will be just as wonderful as the ones I have already tried. 

This will definitely be a great spot in the warmer weather when the patio is open and the outside bar is open...can't wait!"}
{"text":"Great view as it always has been as Rusty Rudders. But was expecting better food, especially as an offspring of The Kindred. Catfish was ok, sort of watery, fries are just ok. Asked for bread, they brought two burnt  pieces bread and what they called \"Crustinis\", zero flavor and like I said burnt.   Coffee was not good, very watery, like gas station coffee. We  will not crave to come back there for food,  only for drinks and maybe and a sunset .  Never post about food on yelp but we were so disappointed and we were so excited about this place opening to enjoy good food by the water. Please change your dinnerware. My husband ate your ice cream out of a paper cup! Our plates were cheap plastic, like Golden Coral  Prices are WAY too high for the quality of food. Only posting this hoping the  food gets better. Hoping the food improves! Things must change here."}
{"text":"Don't go to Hello Sailor expecting massive quantities of fried seafood like you get from many seafood restaurants. But, what you do get is pretty good. Their Calabash-style fried shrimp is the best I've had in a while. I wasn't impressed with their hushpuppies, though. 

Go to Hello Sailor to enjoy the atmosphere and share a variety of unique twists on seafood with family or friends."}
{"text":"Two hour wait, two stars. The drinks were good, but the food was actively bad. Unless you're looking for the Anxious Clown from A Series of Unfortunate Events, I'd avoid this place until they get their shit together."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! We love Kindred, and were hoping for a similar experience, but nothing like that here. The food is overpriced and overseasoned, the decor is sparse and the service even a bit creepy. 

We ordered 1 tea, hushpuppies, 1 platter, poke and pickles, and ended up paying about $60.

The hushpuppies didn't taste bad, but didn't resemble any puppies we had ever had. The texture was very light and fluffy, which made it feel like they weren't done all the way, even though the insides were dry. The tuna poke had many different flavors going on, but unfortunately, tuna was not one of them. Served on a bed of weird crunchy rice, radishes, nuts and other vegetables,  topped with greens and drenched in dressing, this more resembled a strange soup and salad combo than poke. The fish and shrimp combo came with a single small fishstick, overseasoned and with a flaky texture that made eating it with a fork difficult. The shrimp, in contrast, were extremely bland and flavorless. Served with a little bit of avocado slaw in which I was not able to discern any avocado, and an order of greasy fries doused in spices, at $21.95, this was not a lot of food. When we indicated the fries were overseasoned and asked for a serving of unseasoned fries, we were charged an additional $3.99. 

At this price, we were extremely disappointed - the flavor of the seafood was hidden under too much other stuff going on. 

Positives: the view and the pickles (which are the same as at Kindred).

Negatives: too much seasoning, weird flavors, poor service, expensive."}
{"text":"We visited this venue for lunch today, and I'm not surprised by the 3 star current rating.  However, we will give it 1 star and for a few reasons:  my sister has a dairy allergy and I'm vegan.... there were zero options for either.  Being vegan is not always easy by being dairy free is easy... and they had ONE plate that they would even agree to make a change to.  It was sad.  The server and the chef could've cared less to accommodate and all we kept thinking was \"it's 2018\"!!  People have dietary restrictions, preferences, etc.... McDonald's even makes changes to offerings.... let alone some place that claims to have great cuisine.  Let me be clear, I'm not asking for the world to bend around my choice of foods, but Atleast have one good option for Atleast dairy free...  I ended up ordering the side salad which ended up being iceberg lettuce, cucumber and onion with the only option for dressing being straight vinegar. (See picture).  Sad.  oh and a side note:  the server took so long to even clean up used glasses, plates etc that we built a literal pyramid out of it on our table to hope that he might notice it was time to pick something up.  I hope they can turn things around - it's a great location but the food and the service was sub par."}
{"text":"I could write a novel on why this place blows the previous bar out of the water. However, the food would only be the beginning. We ALL know the food at the previous was frozen bar food. And after talking with some of the food distributors that served the former restaurant, it all made sense considering he said they bought THE CHEAPEST ingredients they could. I'm not a foodie nor in the restaurant business, but everyone knows you cant make chicken salad out of chicken ____ . So, for people to talk about Hello Sailor's food in the same breath as the former place, is absolutely laughable. The food is exponentially better than the previous establishment. And, it also doesn't smell like vomit as soon as you walk in the front door which is always a plus when trying to actually eat food. And of course, that's when said door didn't have plywood covering it up from the fight the night before when someone was thrown through it. Parents knew not to bring the kids after dark due to said fights. And that's not to mention the lewd language and activity that went on outside the place as well. If that's not enough, call your local police and fire departments to see how many times they were called to the former bar. It will become very clear that the old place was much more of a liability than it was an asset. 

The short, selective memories that people have are no surprise though. This place is now a restaurant and not a dive bar. So for those coming to post up and drink $1.50 Keystone Lights all day, this is not the place for that. The place has been open ONE MONTH to the day and all the negativity just speaks volumes about the world we live in presently. So, all the gelled hair and affliction shirt aficionados will have to find somewhere else to live out their UFC dreams on the weekends. 

As for the food, if you like McDonalds better as another review alluded to, I just have no words for that type of ignorance. I bet they get their meats from locally sourced farms like Hello Sailor does so that should work out perfectly for said reviewer. Some people never cease to amaze.

The kinks(food, service etc) will be worked out by the time the boating season starts and all these reviews will be a thing of the past. Just like the dive bar that was there before a real restaurant took it's place."}
{"text":"A group of 5 of us girls had tried to make a reservation for this past Friday. Unfortunately, Hello Sailor does not allow a reservation so when we all arrived we were greeted with a 1.5 hour wait. We decided to get a drink from the bar & talk over the wait time. Several of us ordered some pineapple drink because all the other cocktails seemed odd - I don't drink cocktails often, personally I am a beer or wine girl & they had PBR on tap, a little strange to me with this supposedly being classier than the Rudder. 

Speaking of classier, the decor was 100% classier. But the noise was a JOKE! There was no dividers in the entire restaurant which made it feel like everyone was yelling in turn causing you not to be able to hear the person next to you. Also, extremely poor use of the surface area. There was definitely not enough seating. 

Huge disappointment overall. Gave 2 stars because we didn't actually eat so I didn't want to give 1 , yet."}
{"text":"Very expensive and not that good. Sat at bar and had a glass of house Chardonnay (not very good) which the bartender measured before pouring and that was $11. They say it is like a fish camp. Apparently they havent been to one as a fish camp is not that expensive. Seems they are trying to recoup the cost of the place which is loud and like a cafeteria. Canceled a large group to go for my birthday next week. Would not recommend especially if you need anything special if you cannot eat everything. They won't substitute. Would not go back. Might be a nice view in the summer but not for their food.  May need to change menu and pricing to succeed  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"This restaurant deserves 5 stars for its service alone.  Our server was very helpful in explaining the menu.  My husband had the King Crab and I had the ribs.  Our daughters had the chicken fingers but honestly ate our meals with us because they were mesmerized by our food.  NICE work winning our 9 and 3 year olds attention from chicken!   What stood out most about our experience (besides our food and server) was a situation at the table next to us.  A couple who was seated before us when we arrived.  We were seated next to them.  Apparently the wife was unpleased with their seating choice, but instead of saying anything to the server she waited until after the bill came....and here comes the five stars.   The server was very polite.  Without having to consult with ma management, she expressed her concern and dismay for not know If sooner and shared that she could have helped them if they had told her when she asked how their dinner was going or even better when she seated them.  She would have gladly given another table, but they never said anything at the time.   Bottom line, she returned to the table and from what it seems, gave a very generous compensation.  We complimented her handling of the situation to (surprise!) The owner (uhhh...wow...had no idea).  While the acoustics aren't awesome, the food was great and the service to us and others was too.   Nicely done, Kindreds!"}
{"text":"We own Above Board Flooring and take our clients their all the time. The food is great and a great place to do business at. I highly recommend"}
{"text":"Had hoped for better.

My wife with a group of ladies from the Condo came here shortly after they opened and the results were very mixed from the reports.

My wife and I went back last night for dinner. This would have been her second visit and my first.

Most of the restaurants in the area were packed but we had little trouble getting in here at around 6 pm on a Saturday.

Promptly seated a nice table on the upper level overlooking the main dining area. Must say, big improvement from the Rusty Rudder in terms of ambiance.  Nice and clean and fresh with effective decor and all overlooking Lake Norman. The outside dining area is going to be a hit come warmer weather.

Our server was there shortly and he proved to excellent.

Very eclectic  menu with a nice variety of different offerings.

Looking over the menu, I went back to my younger days and what was a favorite in Ohio and Pennsylvania and that was the fried Baloney Sandwich and Fries. My wife had the Caesar Salad with an upgrade with a lobster tail.

The Baloney Sandwich was described as being with a nice thick cut of Chicago Baloney,  Sport Pepper, Celery Salt and Mustard.  Sounded good till I bit into it.

The reason for a garnish or flavoring such as a pepper or whatever is to compliment the main items by complimenting it or adding contrast in either taste of texture.  All you could taste her was the pepper that overpowered everything and that was all you could taste.

Ended up in the end, taking the sandwich apart and eating the boloney separately.  It was a very good, nice and thick slab of Chicago Baloney that by itself, was excellent. The attempt at glamour or showmanship did not do the simple but tasteful baloney justice.

My wife's Caesar Salad was good but that was the smallest lobster tail I have ever seen served in a restaurant. I thought states had minimum size limits on the size of Lobsters you could keep. This Lobster Tail was the size of my index finger at best.

Taste was good bit due to the small size, not more that a couple of bites at best.

Give the restaurant some more months to refine their menu but at the present time, not impressed and that is a shame.  The restaurant is right down the cove from where I live and I was looking forward to coming over by boat when the weather warms up.

We shall see what happens in the next couple of months as the restaurant evolves."}
{"text":"We had a great experience! We sat at the tall tables right away and received great service from the bar tender. We had the lobster roll and hush puppies, everything was excellent!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is worth a 5 Star review. Cocktails are fun and good. Food is easy. Bar chairs have a nice bounce"}
{"text":"As a local resident was really hoping for a nice waterfront Resturant with some good food. Boy did we get the opposite! food was subpar, the building was so loud you couldn't carry on a conversation, waitress was absent and you could tell had no guidance from management."}
{"text":"We waited so long for this highly anticipated addition to the lake.  One visit and I probably won't be back.  Disappointed.  Service was great, as in the wait staff.  Other than that, long wait, overpriced drinks, overpriced food, pretentiously strange menu choices and VERY loud!  Not the layed back lakeside restaurant that we were hoping for.  Not a boating destination restaurant for the family.  My kids will actually miss the Rusty Rudder now."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, very retro!  Food was excellent, had a large party and we all tried different things.  Burger and prime rib sandwiches were fantastic, authentic Calabash style shrimp was very flavorful with cornmeal crust.  Wings, although may sound a bit weird had a lot of great flavors on the dry rub.  Oysters Rockefeller very tasty.  Service was great as well, definitely will be coming back and bringing more friends."}
{"text":"Whomp whomp. I was really looking forward to what Hello Sailor was going to bring and drove up from Charlotte to check it out. Unfortunately i, too, was disappointed. 
So yes, the decorations and marketing are Pinterest worthy. But this seems like it will detract from the laid-back summer lake crowd. I went for lunch on a week day and there seemed to be too many staff working. Our service was fine. 
I agree that the hush puppies were a let down. And to spend $25 on a Tuesday lunch the food was greasy and lackluster (i ordered platter #1 and my favorite part was the sauce). 
The view is classic lake norman, and may be this location's redeeming quality. Gone are the days of cheap beers, cover bands, flip flops, and fun sunburned friends. It will be interesting to see if there are enough folks in the Lake Norman area looking for a Rose' rather than Coors light on a summer day."}
{"text":"I will give them a break as they are brand new. One, I hate the name, ok forget that, its the food and service that matters.  We sat at the bar, the bartender was a nice young guy, the service was good. I think they should dress in uniforms however, you could not tell staff from guests. The drink was good, the food was so so. My main issue with the place is I just don't like the atmosphere and the prices. To bright, just didn't flow for me. I did not like the decor at all. I see what they are trying to do but it just doesn't work for me. I guess they are going for a Palm Springs look from the 70's. Whatever.... Also, I HATE being in a bar and having children not only in the bar area but that night were actually at the bar. That kinda ruins the bar experience for me. I will give it another shot this summer. I like Port City Club much better. Lake Norman is a far cry from Palm Springs."}
{"text":"Went for some drinks with a few friends the other day. Drinks were interesting but didn't taste all that great to me. Bartender was no fun, never smiled once, just seemed like he had a bad attitude :( I want to go back and try the food but I'm not hurrying back any time soon."}
{"text":"2 1/2 stars, actually.
Clean, simple decor...someone said 'Brady Bunch'!?  Acoustics do create a loud space. Staff very friendly and helpful and attentive. We arrived at 6:30 Friday and we're immediately seated. 
I ordered the Wedge salad with Calabash shrimp. I wanted to have a shrimp Po Boy, but they DO NOT substitute. Logically, it makes no sense. I can add shrimp to a salad, but cannot have it on a sandwich. Whatever.
The wedge was good, a huge hunk of iceberg. It could've used more bacon. The shrimp was disappointingly fair. I was expecting a lightly fried, fresh taste but got a slightly greasy serving. The shrimp themselves were pretty fresh.  Honestly, I've prepared better at home.
The beer selection is sad. There are far too many local craft beers available and it's a shame HS doesn't support them. I did order the Free Range 30oz. They serve it in a bucket of ice to keep it cold - Classic! That was the highlight of my dinner.
One friend had the lobster roll, which she said was delicious. I think a little pricey ($20) for the serving size, but it is lobster.
Another friend had the Citrus Crab Louie which was beautiful, fresh and delicious. She had also ordered the Hamachi Poke for a starter. I took one bite and it was fantastic!
So, this is checked off my list. I don't think I'll be back, unless it's for the Poke. 
When on the water in the summer, this would probably be on the bottom of my list of places to grab some food."}
{"text":"The three star rating on yelp is absolutely absurd. It does not reflect the amazing food the restaurant has to offer or the popularity. This restaurant just opened and has been overflowing with customers ever since. We got the last table at 6:15 on a Sunday night. We started with an order of the hush puppies. They were absolutely incredible. They were soft yet crunchy, and managed to have a taste and texture I've never had before in fried bread (which I love). Next we tried the wings, now I am not a huge wing fan but these were delicious. They are made with a dry rub and complemented with a wonderful dipping sauce. Next we ordered the watermelon. I'm not a huge fan of spicy food so I was wary to try it with the chili salt, but once I did I couldn't get enough. It is the taste combination you never knew you needed until you tried it. The oysters were west coast oysters and they were delectable. The sauce that Hello Sailor serves with the oysters is so good I could have it on it's own. We split the grouper for the main course and it was perfectly cooked and accompanied with yummy vegetables. For dinner we ordered the soft serve ice cream which seemed like a weird menu option. However, this is not the \"soft service ice cream\" you had as a kid. It is rich and delicious and served in the perfect sized cup. Hello Sailor is a delicious, hip, and successful new addition to Cornelius. Every menu option has been carefully created, tasted, and perfected and it is absolutely obvious to anyone who dines there. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Frequent kindred about once a week, so had high expectations. Some of the food had good taste especially the fish and hush puppies but their sizing isn't correct. Cole slaw side was a thimble, but fish was a great size. Hand pie was honestly one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten and would highly recommend. Was there for their opening and haven't been back since but hoping they have lighter/healthier options to what is now a very heavy and fried menu."}
{"text":"TLDR; This is not a fish camp. Do not go expecting a fish camp. Find a real one.

I'm from the area and grew up eating at fish camps in Gaston Co. and was excited to try this Hello, Sailor. I've never been to Kindred - I was just looking for solid fried fish. Hello didn't deliver. The atmosphere was cool (I liked it) and the service was nice enough (they were busy so it was a little slow) and the heavily breaded fried fish tasted fine but overly salty. 

My biggest gripes:

1) Portion size. For the same price, you could have gotten 3x the amount of better tasting fish at a real fish camp. I got flounder / shrimp combo that came with 2 sides: a pound of fries and 2oz (three bites worth) of surprisingly good slaw. My son got the same and a side salad for $5. It was about 8oz of chopped ice berg lettuce with a little extras. My daughter got the salt and pepper catfish (no sides included) and received two anemic filets floating in the vest emptiness of the basket. My wife got the crab salad which had a tiny amount of crab atop a heaping pile of poorly chopped lettuce. They did provide a knife for the lettuce, but a salad should not require a knife.

2) No substitutions. With the combo, you get a bite of slaw and a mountain of fries. They won't sub the fries but you can pay $4+ for a small side. Given the tiny portion of the side salad, which is just ice berg, I'd hate to see the size of other sides. A menu needs to have some flexibility - Hello is just ridiculous. 

3) No flexibility. They will not bake, broil or prepare their fish in any way that does not include flour and boiling oil.

4) SRSLY, fried fish in the south and no candy counter?!

I left with the impression that the owner read about something called a \"fish camp,\" thought they could do better ... and then failed on all counts. There is so much room to do this right and I really wish they would have succeeded."}
{"text":"Have now been to Hello Sailor 8 times. Have ordered a different item each time. We love Kindred and eat there frequently.
The indoor and outdoor spaces at Hello Sailor are lovely.  The mid-century modern aesthetic is very authentic and well executed.  Great views and fresh feel..  
we find the menu limited and average.  Have not had one thing that draws me to return ( with exception of the raw oysters which are devine.)
The menu discourages any \"customization\"..of your food and I was not even \"allowed\" to specify how I wanted my burger cooked... yikes!.  
We wish them well .. but are losing interest..."}
{"text":"Fantastic lunch menu.  Beautiful whether your sitting inside or outside on the covered dining room! Drink choices were amazing and presentation on food and drinks was right on.  Service was very attentive..just exactly what you'd want with a beautiful relaxing water view!"}
{"text":"Restaurant sits right on lake Norman with great decor, view and atmosphere. There is a nice assortment of cocktails to be had by the restaurant or under their cool tiki bar. Make sure to try their seafood offerings and leave space for some dessert :)"}
{"text":"We've now eaten here twice- once for dinner and once for lunch. Both times were great. I think people who don't like it are expecting it to be Kindred 2.0 but they said from the beginning it wouldn't be just another Kindred. 

The decor is very cool and different. The cocktails are fun. The food is very seafood heavy. Our least favorite item the 1st visit was the fish/shrimp plate- I just don't think it was anything special for the price. The 2nd time we decided to skip anything fried and that's the way to go. The hamachi bowl was ammmmazing- such fresh and interesting flavors. The lobster roll was also delicious. We got avocado slaw both times, it's basically a mix of slaw and guacamole.  The 1st time we had poke cake- I'll order that every time I go back if it's available- one of my favorite desserts ever and a huge portion!

This is a fun date night spot especially when the weather is nice! We'll definitely go back- the menu is always changing so there will be new things to try."}
{"text":"The renovations are very nice (from what rusty rudder was), had a bit of an updated '70s look. It took 30 minutes to get our drinks, I got the \"sea legs\" which is a unique spicy/smoky cocktail, I enjoyed it, but way too much ice in their drinks (the spritzer was the same). We ordered the crab dip which was good, but maybe a cup of dip (if that)...not a sharable appetizers for 4-and for $13 it really shouldn't have been served with plastic wrapped crackers. When my husband ordered the pork belly dish, our waitress said \"oh, you want to give that a try?\"  (Face slightly scrunched in disgust) and i jumped in and asked if there was a reason he shouldnt. She said \"well it includes squid tubes and tentacles, a lot of people get freaked out by that\". Clearly she was one of those people--way to upsell the product. When my meal came, I thought it was an appetizer being brought to the wrong table...no, it was my meal.  3 pieces of catfish about the size of hockey pucks but not as thick....and that was it (oh, and some sauce). After our miniature food was served, our waitress didn't return until time to clear the table. The noise was horrible,  like being in an empty warehouse-and the kids screaming to the right of us didnt help. There is nothing to absorb all the noise, we couldn't hear each other speak.  What little food we had tasted very good, but not for what we paid. Needless to say, we ALL left hungry and down $150!"}
{"text":"Negative stars are not available. Worst service ever and no one gives a care about you. Never in my adult life have I experienced service like this. Food came out one plate at a time, appetizers never came and servers have so much attitude when you ask where your food is.
Bring back the Rusty Rudder as I knew what I was getting into.
I might even stop going to Kindred now. Apparently it's true and you can't duplicate your success with multiple restaurants."}
{"text":"Delicious. Hamachi might be one of the best things I've eaten. Lobster roll did not disappoint. Sunchokes small plate was fantastic.  It's not Kindred and it's also not trying to be!"}
{"text":"My wife and I wanted to give this restaurant a try.  We came in for a late lunch and we ad a great window table with a reattach view.  The service was very good and we enjoyed the conversation and recommendations from our server.  I give the service a four star rating during this visit.  

We started with some chicken wings.  The flavor was very good however they looked burnt.  I wish the wings were larger and meatier. They did taste good.   

We split the daily fish special.  It tasted good.  I did think it was rather expensive $ 24.99.  ."}
{"text":"Pretty bad experience all around. We take the boat over and parked at one of their docks. We check in and they tell us it's an hour wait. It is Saturday evening so that was expected. We go to the bar and try what I thought was a made to order cocktail only to find out it was made and bottled a few days earlier. I drank the tasteless overpriced drink and switched to beer. You can't go wrong with that a long as it is cold. We approached the hostess after waiting about an hour and a half only to find that our name was no longer on the list. Fortunately they sat us right away (there were open tables available the entire time we were there, inside and outside). We were approached by our waitress pretty quickly and ordered some hush puppies. We already had drinks from the bar. We were starving so we were ready to order once she brought our apps. The puppies were just ok. They were out of 2 of the 6ish entrees so we all just kind of settled. I ended up getting the calabash platter. I believe the frying oil was old or they just flat out burnt the fish. The other members in our party felt the same about the food. We hurriedly finished our food and headed home since it was about 10pm. I may try it again but it's not likely."}
{"text":"Best items: collards and the cole slaw. Everything else - blech. I had the trout. $23 for half a trout. At 131Main you get a delicious whole trout w fries and slaw for $23   This trout was served on a bed of herbs- mint heavy.  Hubby had catfish.  Okay. He's had better for less.  He ordered the greens and slaw.  Those were good.  I got Beef fat fries.  I think I'll be tasting them for DAYS.  Our appetizer was the crab pimento cheese dip.  Good, but not worth &12.  Served with individually wrapped captains wafers.  Really?  Toast points would be classier.  It will be interesting to see how the boating crowd feels about this restaurant come dummer."}
{"text":"Very noisy, too bright and cold (temperature and ambiance) bare bones seating like a NJ diner BUT the cocktails and food were amazing-oysters and scallop special! The food doesn't really fit with atmosphere. Price is in line with other similar restaurants. Great deck that we are looking forward to in summer."}
{"text":"Amazing night; staff very accommodating and started with cocktails. The littleneck clam appetizer was superb and then onto the Calabash shrimp. Wedge salad hit the spot, but the final delight was dessert. Found a new spot to enjoy a weekend evening."}
{"text":"Dropped in just to check out the place. I ended up running into an old friend that worked there. She steered me in the right direction with the food. I grabbed a cocktail, relaxed with the Poke, devoured the Lobster Roll and wound down with a Narragansett. The decor was beautifully retro and the hospitality was top notch, I felt the STAFF cared about my experience as they all checked in on me and even made suggestions to do dessert at their sister restaurant, Kindred.
Only negative was the sound spill over from the bar...I had to reach deep for that bad mark."}
{"text":"They do not offer substitutions for your diet. I'm on a carb free diet, asked to sub fries for something else was told blatantly NO. Also ended up getting a burger with no bun, the patties seemed pressed and way to salty. Not a fan."}
{"text":"All of our food was delicious- I can't believe the bad reviews. I went with my family and my dad had the scallops, I had the hamachi bowl with peas and carrots as a side and my mom had the crab Louie salad. Everyone loved what they had. The service was also great- I have a dairy allergy and the waitress took the menu to the kitchen where the chef crossed out everything with dairy in it. It was a little slow for not being very crowded (we went on a Tuesday). All in all, great experience and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Goodbye Main Street, Hello Lakeside! Kindred hits another home run with a seafood focused Lake Norman waterfront restaurant tucked away in Cornelius. We were lucky to be one of only a few lunchtime patrons on Tuesday, January 2, so enjoyed a relaxing meal with wonderful service, great views, and plenty of sunshine. 

The attention to detail here really allows you to feel transported from whatever is going on with you day to someplace that fees like vacation. The photo booth near the bar is a nice touch, but the art on the walls, the throw-back small trays, furniture, and even the cocktail containers make sure you sit back and let any stress melt away. A very casual feel, but the service was friendly and certainly made us feel right at home. 

Calabash shrimp is an excellent preparation and worth coming back to again and again, but it was the hearty \"Chicago-ish style\" fried bologna sandwich on a bun totally covered in poppy seeds that really pulled at my memories of egg and Taylor ham breakfast sandwiches made by my father back in New Jersey. Also, Haberdish now has a competitor for best hushpuppies in Charlotte...so light and fluffy, plus the cheese ball was a great addition for more flavor. 

Kindred ranks as one of my top five places to take out of town visitors and Hello, Sailor is now a wonderful addition to the best of the best in Charlotte of distinct concepts and certainly a standout for the Lake Norman crowd. Look forward to visiting again on warmer weather when the back patio is open and high five to favorite Free Range Brewing for getting an exclusive growler of pilsner for $10. Great stuff."}
{"text":"Food was just okay.  Very pricey. Given the price and limited food selection probably won't be back.Definitely not the spot to come off the lake and have a bite to eat and have a few drinks."}
{"text":"We went to Hello, Sailor twice while in Lake Norman area.  Once by car and once by boat.  Hostess was busy when arrived 1st visit (car) and took a couple of minutes to get seated.  But once that happened we promptly seated in outdoor patio with a great view of the boat slips.   We ordered appetizers of hush puppies and asparagus both quickly arrived and were eaten the same.  Our party of 4 ordered 3 skillet burgers and the Crab Louie salad. I had the Burger and found it to have great flavor-yet with its own uniqueness.   The Crab Louie was also raved by its consumer.   
On second visit we arrived by boat and were promptly seated. We were fortunate to have the same server, Bernadette as the first visit.  She recognized us and made us feel immediately welcomed, even remembering our drink orders.  There were a couple of burgers reordered in our now party of 5.  After we were done my mother in law said she can't remember the last time she ate a whole double patty burger. I had the Chicago bologna which comes on a Poppy seed bun.  If you don't like poppy seed this is not for you.  It was spicy with the sport peppers but not overwhelming.  The lobster roll was also ordered and was also raved.   

We had a great visit and had visited the previous establishment a couple of times.  We were impressed with the new decorating and enjoyed the food.   All the staff was friendly but Bernadette was exceptional in taking care of us and definitely made us want to return in our future visits to the Lake Norman area."}
{"text":"This place sucks ! Closes at 10 and they don't have jager ! Not a Lake spot ! Come for prom not a good time !"}
{"text":"We had a friend in from out of town and decided to go to Hello Sailor. The restaurant is very tastefully decorated and the service was very attentive. The menu selections were very nice. However the drinks are very creative but the New York city prices weren't. For 3 people the tab was over $165.  That's ridiculous for the lake. They are going to very surprised when boating season is here and boaters come in off the lake for cocktails and a meal and walk out with a 3 figure bill and they don't go back. Unless its a very special occasion I won't be back. There are other restaurants to go to that are much more reasonable and have the lake ambiance. Sorry Hello Sailor!"}
{"text":"The food is very flavorful. Drinks are great with fun presentation. Service is friendly. Atmosphere is pleasant. The prices are a bit high so you have to be ready to spend a little money but worth it."}
{"text":"Will go back. Fried shrimp was plentiful and delicious as an addition to my wedge salad. But they forgot the blue cheese and the bacon bits were petrified."}
{"text":"Horrible! Cheap tables paper menus and plastic forks???? The Brady Bunch called and want their fireplace back! What look are they going for? Cafeteria style? Or Fufu food? Not one thing on this menu would I order. If your a vegetarian don't even waste your time or gas. Atmosphere is cold and cheap-looking. Over priced food served on disposable plates. I was reading reviews when waitress walked up she said dont believe those reviews! I asked her why and wasnt given a answer. I agree Rusty Rudder needed a clean up but with this? Who wants to come off their boat in a bathing suit and order anything this menu has to offer! So disappointed will never go back. Hoping they are out of bussiness ASAP and replaced with a fun upbeat restaurant with a menu that offers casual affordably choices! Good bye Sailor!"}
{"text":"Let's start with the positive. The restaurant is very cool, lots of natural light that come thru the many big windows around the room. The room is light in the color palette, which makes it more nautical and bright. The colors are more Art Deco. The view of the lake at Hello Sailor is great. The staff is friendly and welcoming. 

Now, let's get to the negative. They have a limited menu, which can be a good thing as you then specialize in the few items and make great food.  However, there is too much fried food. Also, the options for small plates are very limited, so you are forced to order from the main entrees, even if you only want something small. We were hoping for some salmon paired with vegetables prepared in a healthy tasty way, especially this being a seafood restaurant. Well, they don't have salmon on the menu. Even at the bowling alley in Huntersville they offer grilled salmon paired with steamed broccoli!!!! On top of the menu being limited they ran out of chicken wings at six in the afternoon, making your options even more limited in case you don't want deep fried/breaded food (hushpuppies, shrimp, etc). The food and the drinks are overpriced.

We ended up having a glass of Italian Rosé wine, an Old fashioned and the grilled Caesar salad. Then we had to go to Port City, also on the lake, to eat some salmon. However, we have to say that the Old fashioned was prepared very well (fitting for $14), and that the salad was delicious. 

We sat at the bar and the bartenders were genuinely nice and efficient. Kudos to them!

Will we come back? Only if they change the menu to offer seafood prepared in a lighter way and more small plates."}
{"text":"Moving to area. This place was highly recommended. Although the view was great despite the cold weather tarp the rest of our experience was lack luster. We ordered a couple Moscow Mules but with Bourbon. Not mixed very well. Way too much ice. We started with crab dip. Upon its arrival, it was a small portion in a shallow dish and packaged Keebler crackers. Perhaps some small bruschetta toast would enhance the experience?  Round 2 of cocktails. Obviously changed it up. Ordered Manhattan's up. Classic simple drink to turn the evening around.....nope. Looked like it was served in a Sherry wine glass. Obviously not our night. Got the bill. OMG. $60.00 for 4 lousy drinks and $12.00 for crab dip with peel the wrapper crackers. Fortunately many other cool places to try."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there tonight with a very positive feeling. The restaurant is nice but we were not happy for the following 4 reasons. 1) the menu is very limited. 2) the appetizer took 30 minutes to get after we ordered it. 3) the plastic plate full of fries, over cooked flounder and popcorn shrimp cost $25. 4) the total bill with tip for two people was over $100!!!!!  Should have been no more than $60 max. 
I discussed my feelings with the owner, he apologized and listened to my complaints. I can tell that the owner is really concerned when you are not a happy customer and that goes a long way. But in the end, 3 things have to happen at Hello Sailor. 1) Food quality has to improve, 2) Prices for food and drink have to come down & 3) Service has to get better. 
Will try again in a couple of months and see if things have improved."}
{"text":"Hello Sailor is a good addition to the lake but will likely need some time to hit its stride. The ambience will work better in the Summer when the deck seating is open. Now in December it feels very stark and cold and the the breeze from the front door requires guests to wear their coats at the tables in the front. 
The service was very attentive and informed. The menu was somewhat limited with fancy names for relatively basic fare. \"Shrimp Callabash\" is just fried shrimp in a plastic basket. The menu is heavy on fried stuff and definitely over salted in the kitchen,so if you are sodium sensitive you may need to mention that when ordering. 
The cocktails are imaginative but taste like the bartenders are using lower end liquor. And the drink descriptions are not complete. The \"Marlin Darling\" has a very spicy kick ingredient that isn't mentioned on the menu. The wine list is short and not impressive. 
The servers were quick to make things right and happy to accommodate guest requests. 
Two other points- the restaurant is really loud. High ceilings and no rugs or fabric make sounds echo like a college cafeteria at lunchtime.  And the lighting is really bad. It is stylish but ineffective. Everyone was reading the menus with their IPhone flashlights. 
Overall I think Kindred's experience will carry over to the Lake and, in time, we should have a new hot spot on the water."}
{"text":"We had a great experience here. Even on Memorial Day weekend, we were seated promptly and received great service from our server Jesse. He was very accommodating of the Golden Retriever in our party, which was appreciated. :) The food and cocktails were amazing as well! We ordered the hush puppies, fried catfish and crab dip to share. The catfish was especially delicious. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and any food we ordered was incredible. You have to try the hush puppies or sunchokes & caviar. You won't be disappointed. If you're going for something simple, try the skillet burger, but if you're going more entree, the scallops are incredible. Give it a chance!"}
{"text":"2nd time- nailed it, again. I'm not sure why they're getting a bad wrap. I think it's just people that don't understand what the Kindreds are going for in the vision. They have some things to work out on the menu - we won't get the crab bites again for the amount and price but that's what i get for not going for the more complex choices. Love, love the decor- it's definitely too loud. We could hardly hear the waiter and the rest of our party- room for improvement there. Love the paper menus, cafeteria glasses and glassware. We were bummed they didn't have the whole flounder but happy to try new menu items. The scallops and Brussels sprouts and the #2 were amazing. My kids loved the scallop dish and they always complain about the all in ones. The appetizer we had was like a ceviche but not- it was on the raw menu and I can't remember what it was called and it was the first night on the menu. Anyway - it was awesome. Hush puppies, fries, pickles- we loved it all. Our server kicked ass and it was a great night. Can't forget to compliment the awesome cocktails. We'll be back soon and hopefully by boat!"}
{"text":"Just eat here for the 1st time. My wife and I had heard about the location and had seen a few not so good reviews. We decided to try for ourselves and we are glad we did. The location is great. Very nice view of the lake and with their own docks gives access to boaters and all the entertainment that comes with boaters trying to dock on a 1st comes 1st basis.  My wife had the lobster roll. She said it was very good but felt it was a bit over priced based upon our travels to the NE area. I had the citrus crab salad and was very pleased with its flavor and value. Our waitress was very helpful and friendly as well... We definitely will come back!!"}
{"text":"After reading all the poor reviews, decided to give a try for dinner.  Parking by boat much easier than in the past. Seating was quick for party of four. Service polite an d prompt. And food was excellent. We ordered and shared a variety of plates and enjoyed them all.  The sauces were wonderful and we were all  impressed.  Best dish Of all the asparagus in an amazing sauce.   A bit on pricey side but then again quite a step up from typical boater food.  Will return and let others know it's worth a visit."}
{"text":"Ok we heard nothing but great reviews So we have it a try with another couple. The views are amazing and the decor is from the 70's what is very retro. Ok now onto the food. West coast oysters with the tupac i.d. card which was awesome was very good. The hush puppies were different and so light and very tasty. The grilled Caesar salad was good but not worth $10.  The beef fat French fries are amazing. The pickles and asparagus very also good but not worth ordering it again. The oysters Rockefeller are very very good. Now onto the lobster roll. It states it's an entire lobster in the roll. They must find the smallest lobsters cause there is no way there us an entire lobster in there. The taste has waaaaay to much dill in the mix for my taste. You better like dill to like this lobster roll and for $30 I would recommend ordering a few other items instead. We don't mind paying for food but overpriced for the portion sizes on what we ordered and nothing over the top to make us to want to come back. We wpuld recommend to go sit outside have a few drinks order the fries and hush puppies."}
{"text":"The service was good which is the only positive thing I can honestly say. The food was average at best. The draft beer was a little flat and not really that cold. It's a shame there aren't more places to go on the lake."}
{"text":"We went for Mother's Day brunch. It was not impressive. $35 a plate. For chicken sandwiches, chicken fingers and popcorn shrimp. Complete rip off. Won't be going back"}
{"text":"Hello Sailor impressed and transformed a cold and rainy evening into a stellar girls night! We camped out at the bar with fabulous service which set sail to an amazing dining experience! We decided to sample small plates and share. Our favorites included the charred broccoli, wings, hush puppies, avocado slaw and of course the chocolate/vanilla swirl ice cream for dessert! Bartenders were fantastic and so was the overall experience! LOVED the mid-century modern upgrade and overall style! Looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch one afternoon with my brother, the atmosphere was amazing! Very modern and stylish, and honestly the best cheeseburger I've ever had in my life! The views are amazing, and it's always fun to drive down memory lane"}

Having lived on the lake for 19 years and going to dinner by boat 1-2 nights a week we feel like we know every spot on the lake.   We have heard so many bad things about Hello Sailor that we have avoided it.  Over the weekend we heard some glowing reviews so we decided to give it a try, figuring they have all the kinks worked out.  Since they have been open for 6 months.   Unfortunately, we were sadly mistaken.

We arrived on a Tuesday night by boat around 6:15pm.  We were surprised to see only 1 boat using the boat slips.  Previously when you would go to the Rusty Rudder, you would expect to wait on a boat slip on any night.

We walked up the newly remodeled deck and saw a number of empty tables.  The deck and the inside of the restaurant look fantastic.  They have done a marvelous job with the remodel.  We went to the front and noticed a large line of people waiting to be seated.   The entire inside of the restaurant was empty and only about half of the tables outside were full, yet there was a wait for a table.  We decided to go to the bar and have a drink.   There were 8 people at the bar, our party of 7 almost doubled the number of people at the bar.  We ordered 4 beers and 2 mixed drinks.   The frazzled bartended told us we needed to wait a minute, and 5 minutes later he came back and asked us what we wanted.   He fixed the beers, but was unable to make the drinks, and another bartender made them.  (they were very complicated Gin and Tonic).  We were halfway through our beers when the mixed drinks were made and shortly our table was ready.  Surprising, the table was in view of the bar and was empty the entire time we were there.   They either wanted us to go to the bar or the host was Incompetent.   I assume the latter, because in no way would they want to show off the lack of bartending skills.

By the time we sat down, we all were ready for another drink.  The waiter comes by and asks if we want water, and we tell him that we are ready for a drink, he tells us that he has to get us water first before he can get us a drink.   We all wait while this goes on, we make our drink orders and wait about 15-20 minutes for our drinks.  We ordered Hush Puppies for $3.99.   We are told that for 7 people we would need to get 2 orders that only 5 come to an order.  For those doing the math, that is $.80 per hushpuppy!  They were good, but not that good.

Now it is time to order.   My wife orders the crispy chicken sandwich, and asks if she could add cheese to it.  The waiter informs her that unfortunately she cannot.   He stated, they purchase local foods and match them exactly with the portions and that cheese does not come on that sandwich so she cannot have cheese on her sandwich.   Our friend orders a burger and does not want cheese her burger and asks if she can put her cheese on my wife's sandwich.  We are informed that that is not possible, but she could have her cheese on the side, and when it comes to the table she could give then give her the slice of cheese.   When the food arrives, we place another order for a round of drinks, this take about 20 minutes.  The drinks arrive just as we finish eating.  The waiter apologizes for how slow the bar service is, and says it is because they are slammed.  We look around at the half empty tables and I ask him what are they going to do on a Saturday or busy holiday weekend.   He said they will be staffed up by then.

The food was mediocre.   For being as pretentious as they are, North Harbor has much better food and better trained staff.  If you want a fun atmosphere live music, Blue Parrot and Apps and Taps is well worth the 30-40 minute boat ride over this place.   We really wanted this place to be great, as we need more places on the lake to go to by boat.   Unfortunately, this will not fill the void and will drive more people to the good places on the lake.

Read the reviews on the site.  It is all from people from Charlotte or out of town that are amazed by the view.  They are happy to have overpriced crappy food, with horrible service as long as they have a view.   Please, send all the out of towners and Charlotte people here.  Leave all the other places on the Lake for the locals."}
{"text":"Let me begin by stating that our service was excellent. The food however, was a little lacking, especially considering the price. Hush puppies were very good. The iced tea was terrible. The crab salad, which I was told was once ranked Charlottes #1 salad, was a little lacking in flavor. I wouldn't rank it in my top ten favorite salads in Charlotte. The ambiance was nice, very hip and fresh. Since I live in the city, I don't see myself driving to the lake to eat here again."}
{"text":"The old Rusty Rutter got a cool retro make over. The deck is especially nice. The servers and hostess were very friendly. The food is fish house chic at $15 a plate ( entree only). If you want fish camp style food skip the hush puppies, salt & pepper catfish and Carolina shrimp Calabash and go to another restaurant. Our food was not edible and still cost $50."}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere on the lake.  Very limited menu... great if you like fried food which I do not.  Waiter quoted us the incorrect price on our appetizer but to their credit, they did give us the lower price he quoted.  Very limited drink and wine menu.  Dessert choices are soft serve ice cream (great if you're 8 years old) and one kind of pie which tonight was cranberry and ginger.  Eww.  What we did have (salads) were good but this restaurant is definitely not worth the hype."}
{"text":"Great setting and service on Lake Norman.   This is a nice casual place to eat at the lake and enjoy some drinks.  The food is pretty average, but who cares."}
{"text":"Hello, Sailor has been on my to-do list since they opened and we finally had the pleasure of dining with them last Friday (5/25). We arrived around 12pm and checked in with hostesses and since they weren't overly packed yet, we had the choice of sitting inside or out. We opted to sit outside and enjoy the view of the water. Upon being seated our waitress arrived, introduced herself, and guided us through the menu. I was impressed by the options and relieved it wasn't an overly complicated menu. The kids menu was great too. We started off with two orders of hush puppies, which were delicious. I opted for the Citrus Crab Louie salad & my teenager was happy to make the PEI Mussels his lunch. My two youngest (5 y/o & 9 y/o) ordered the chicken tenders w/ fries and the shrimp boat w/ fires. The hush puppies were delicious, a little crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. The butter that is served with them is amazing. I believe the waitress said it was a citrus butter. The Citrus Crab Louie (recommended by the waitress) was perfect. It was loaded with chilled crab, lots of crispy fresh lettuces, grapefruit slices, and creamy ranch dressing. My son devoured the mussels and was happy to soak up the sauce with the crisp toast that accompanied it. My oldest daughter loved the shrimp boat and fries. Only complaint was that not all of the shrimp were deveined, not sure if that grosses you out or not but it does gross out a 9 year old. The chicken tenders were small but perfect for little hands. I would definitely recommend. Whatever kinks they had when they first opened are no longer there, so check them out! We left with my 5 y/o proclaiming that it was the best lunch ever.

Bottom line: We ventured to Hello, Sailor with low expectations based on reviews but we left with happy bellies and big smiles.


Updating because I forgot to mention the soft-serve. Save room for it because it will rock your world. We had passion fruit and passion fruit-vanilla swirl. One order is enough for two."}
{"text":"Bottom line:  very overpriced.   Sometimes you pay more for better quality. That is not the case here.  

I did not care for the food.  I had 14.99 Salt and Pepper Catfish.  For 14.99 I got four medium sized catfish filets. Sides are a la carte, so all that I received was just the fish.  Over battered. Over cooked. Slightly fishy.  It is not an exaggeration that is was similar to a fish stick. 

I also ordered the hush puppies and the beef fat fries. The hush puppies are spiced differently from traditional hush puppies and I also did not care for them. However, to be fair they were well-cooked and very light. The beef fat fries were good but we're not great.


Our service was good.  

To sum it up, I had read the previous reviews and had wondered if there were not simply issues with the startup and with simply different tastes.  However I would agree with so many of the previous reviews that the food is wildly overpriced. Whether you like the food or not is a matter of taste, but given how often I have enjoyed catfish at other restaurants (North Harbor Club for instance) and hush puppies at other restaurants, and even fries at other restaurants, I was very surprised at how little I enjoyed these items at Hello Sailor."}
{"text":"Arrived at 6:30 on a Tuesday night and had a 45-60 minute wait.  That's fine, had a glass of wine at the bar (only 1 Cabernet option available, $12).  Bar service was fine, no problems and we were eventually able to find seats at the bar for our wait.  We were seated after about 45 minutes and placed our orders for more drinks & the poke appetizer.  After a few minutes of looking over the limited menu, we placed our dinner orders.  The appetizer came out at the same exact time as our dinner order, which was unfortunate.  The poke bowl was great, the rest of the dinner, meh.  I had Platter #1 ($22) which included fried fish, fried shrimp and very fried fries.  My friend had the same thing and her fish was about twice the size of mine!  That was my favorite part of the dinner, so I was bummed.  The avocado slaw was pretty good too, and I was thankful for it after seeing all the fried food on my small plastic tray.  

I had a good time with my friends, but for the $75 I ended up spending, I would have rather gone to a higher end steakhouse or seafood restaurant.  This place is entirely too loud and the lighting in the dining area is horrible.  I felt like I was in a rehabbed Pizza Hut rather than a totally renovated waterfront restaurant.  I expected more from the Kindred's...I love Kindred, so I had high expectations.  I'll try again in the summer and hope the menu, prices, and the outdoor area will keep me coming back.  Fingers crossed!"}
{"text":"Very nice. We will return.  Prices and food were good.  I would give 5 stars except the \"medium\" hamburg one of us ordered was actually well done.  But everything was delicious and the water views were wonderful."}
{"text":"We were so glad we didn't listen to the reviews and came here anyways. This place is AWESOME. We literally cannot understand the poor reviews. Here's the thing: it captures a very mid century Palm Springs California vibe. They own it. But it's exactly how it feels on the west coast. The food is creative and delicious. And the experience is very thoughtful from the wooden spoons for soft serve ice cream to the Tupac west coast oysters.

If you want a full restaurant experience that is different from the norm, we highly recommend Old Sailor. Thank you Walberto!!! You were incredible ."}
{"text":"So not what I expected whatsoever! Terrible customer service! My boyfriend and I waited for 30 minutes to just get our drinks. We didn't even waste our time ordering. I felt the atmosphere was very cold, not welcoming and would not recommend!
Overall, disappointed!! We will NOT be back!"}
{"text":"I want to preface my review with its not kindred and you shouldn't go into it thinking it will be like kindred or you may be disappointed. However, if you go into it open minded I think you will enjoy it. 

Their drink menu and decor makes you feel like you are vacationing in Palm Springs. We started with some east and west coast oysters - they were some of the best I've ever had. For entrees I ordered the calabash chicken sandwich with avocado coleslaw and my fiancé ordered the Carolina shrimp calabash platter, everything was great! Sometimes when shrimp is fried it can get rubbery but these were cooked perfectly. Finally, we finished with a s'mores cake and some vanilla soft serve that were SO GOOD! 

Can't wait to go back this summer!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! Their shrimp calabash is delicious! My husband had a humachi dish that was amazing. I tried the chicken wings even though I don't typically do that in a seafood restaurant because I've heard so much about them and I'm so glad that I did. They are fantastic. I also loved the crab dip and I loved the hush puppies. The crab leg appetizer was a little small for what it was but everything else was so stellar that it didn't seem to bother me that much. The hand pies for dessert and the homemade ice cream really hit the spot too.

The view is unbelievable so make sure that you sit outside if you can. They do not take reservations so I'd go early if I was you. You'll love it."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what this place is \"going for\" vis-a-vis ambiance, feel, etc. But the vibe is definitely \"tacky 1970's\" -- plastic glasses, melamine plates, cheap bamboo bowls and Formica. This is all well and good for a fish camp. However, when dinner is almost $400 for 6 people ( only two had an alcoholic beverage), something is wrong. 

The \"calabash shrimp\" were lightly breaded and fried shrimp with no flavor. The trout fillet was good (a little underdone) served over a \"root vegetable slaw\" with globs of mayo in it sticking out from under the trout. Yuck. The hamburger was fine; the skinny beef fat cooked French fries were ok. The crab dip appetizer was served with 5 pkgs of cello-wrapped crackers. The lobster bisque was flavorful but woefully thin. The 1 lb of snow crab legs was served, again, on a melamine plate: for $62 a la carte. 

All in all a very expensive and disappointing experience. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"We read the reviews which were mixed but wanted to try it anyway.  We were so disappointed. I had the shrimp and flounder platter. I don't mind fried fish but the portion was too small for 24.00.  the fries were like McDonald's and the slaw was the size of a thimble.  We added a side salad which was ok but a child's size for 4.49.  I mentioned all this to the server who was very good. She said the cheese in the salad was bought locally.  That doesn't make up for the portion.  The view is great but we'll just keep going to North Harbor for better food at a lesser price."}
{"text":"Loved everything about my visit! The decor was so cool! The food, drinks and service were all amazing and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I was thinking about giving this 1 star because it was so disappointing. I spent $90 and left still hungry because of their high prices and silly small portions. The crab claws had a weird conflicting flavor profile and were not enjoyable. The drinks are good and the ambience is good but the food is very underwhelming taste wise."}
{"text":"We read all the bad reviews and still wanted to give this place a try. Whhaaat were we thinking?! Such a waste of our time. When we arrived they took our phone number and we proceeded to the outside bar to grab a few cocktails (which is why they make you wait--so you get drinks even though there were tables open). My wife's cocktail was a premixed slushee and was only about half full. When we asked if they only give half a glass he said yes that's how they normally fill them. Uhm. Okay. Half filled cocktails. At that point we should've remembered all the bad reviews and just left but our stubborn selves proceeded. We they took us to the table outside we asked if we could sit in one of the open tables closer to the water. They said no, that they're reserved. Okay...even though someone didn't sit there till we almost left.

So, we ordered hush puppies to start. They weren't that great...and then we found a fried CHICKEN FEATHER in our hush puppies. Omg. Wanted to puke right then and there. Not just a small chicken feather either. This was a legit chicken feather. If they miss pulling a chicken feather out of the little baby hush puppies then what else are they missing in the kitchen? So bad. Well, we couldn't eat anything else there so after about 10 minutes trying to get our waitresses attention we mentioned that we needed our check and that there was a chicken feather in the food. She then said \"your dinner is on us\". Really?! Our hush puppies are \"on us\"?!--like you're doing us a favor comping a single order of nasty hush puppies--So insulting. They should've also given us back our money for the crappy cocktails we ordered at the bar.

This was a waste of our time and so nasty. We went to The Blue Parrot Grill instead and had a great time and really great food (get their coconut shrimp)!!! But don't waist your time coming to this Sailor place. So bad."}
{"text":"I dined here as a party of 12 on a Sunday afternoon. The weather was beautiful, so both indoor and outdoor seating were packed. We arrived via boat, so that is definitely one positive of Hello Sailor-the option to arrive for dining either via boat or car. There are only a handful of slips at the dock though, so that is something to consider. 


We were quoted a 2 hour wait for outside, 90 minutes for inside. We inquired about the wait if we broke up our party, which brought the wait down to an hour. We, however, were sat within 10 minutes at two tables outside. Part of our party ordered drinks and food at the bar, which arrived at the tables shortly after ordering. Service was friendly and, impressively, kept up with the free-flowing mojitos certain members of our party were ordering. 


My table of 6 ordered the following:

*chicken wings- Served with Alabama white sauce (which was delicious), I loved that these were crispy and well-seasoned.

*Hushpuppies-served with honey butter and surprisingly light. 

*Deviled crab dip (pimento cheese and captain's wafers)- Really lacked flavor as well as larger crab chunks. I didn't like the fact it came with prepacked crackers; toasted bread would have been better. Would not recommend ordering this.

*baby back pork ribs-served with mustard bbq sauce, very tender and a nice portion.

*side order of beef fat fries-Fried crisp, served hot. Decent fries but no indication particularly of \"beef fat\".

*Crispy chicken sandwich-shared by my MIL and her BF. Did not try but they both liked it a lot.

The other table in our party also ordered the skillet burger and had the watermelon with al pastor and sea salt and said both were delicious. I thought the prices were high, overall, but some items were reasonably priced. 

I also feel the need to call out the sick soundtrack at Hello, Sailor! LOVED the 1990s Outkast (ATLiens and Aquemini albums) bumping throughout our meal! As far as restaurants accessible by boat, Hello Sailor is near the top but all considering, it's just A-ok with a few high points as well as low points."}
{"text":"We loved the Rudder too, for what it was, but Hello, Sailor is the bold, delicious new restaurant that Lake Norman needed.  The decor is refreshing and modern.  There are plenty of solid just-off-the-boat options (like the fried bologna sandwich, the burger and the fried seafood) but also some dishes best consumed not on a rocking boat (like Hamachi Poke, Citrus Crab Louie and Lobster Bisque).  The bar menu has a wide range of options too, from Miller High Life 40s and Cherry Sun Drop Slushies to bourbon cocktails. Don't forget to top it all off with a handpie, German Chocolate Poke cake (our personal fave) or their 'gram-worthy soft serve.  The porch has a beautiful view and the tiki bar will be the place to be on Lake Norman this summer, for sure."}
{"text":"Excellent!!!   Great food and great service!!!  Don't listen to the negative reviews.  Go and enjoy the best location on the lake."}
{"text":"After walking into this chic spot with Mad Men era decor, we were greeted by kind and helpful staff. After choosing from a nice selection of local beers, craft cocktails and win, we then looked into the food menu. It is a little menu, with most options fried, but what they have, they do well. Don't come to Hello Sailor expecting something else, don't come here with a close mind. This restaurant hosts a staff that is willing to describe the menu items to you so if you are uncertain of what the meal entails, just ask. My mom had the Lobster Roll and fell in love with the bun, also stating \"lobster is cooked great.\" My father tried the No. 2 Platter with Ribs and Calabash Shrimp, he said the rib sauce was \"an interesting / delicious sauce\" (but not a typical barbecue sauce) and our whole table found the calabash shrimp to be juicy, fried bites!! I had the Crab Louie Salad with Sautéed Shrimp. There were many elements to the salad, crab, shrimp, citrus, Parmesan crumbs, and every bite was delicious!! I recommend this spot if you're open to an original menu with wonderful flavor!!"}
{"text":"Great job on plates,presentations. Staff was so on game. Will come back!!! Our new Summer Spot...."}
{"text":"I think the 3 star review that they currently have is very fair. This is how I'd break it down:

Ambiance/decor: 5
Menu options: 2
Food: 3
Service: 3 

I think the menu is VERY limited, in addition there are absolutely NO substitutions, although, I'm not a fan of that practice it's not the biggest deal except when the policy applies to kids meals as well. My 2 yr old is a very picky eater, they had Mac n cheese on the menu which she doesn't eat. I asked if they can do just plain pasta with butter. I don't think that's too much to ask for when clearly they have both ingredients and wouldn't be much trouble for anyone involved, but their response was still basically, 'no substitutions'. Ended up getting my daughter the Mac n cheese she took one bite and said, it was too saucy, no surprise there since she likes her pasta plain with butter.

With the limited menu there wasn't rlly anything that I wanted but ended up deciding on the crab Louie salad and it was mediocre at best. Lacked flavor and very average, the only flavor that stood out was the dill (not in a good way). I only ended up having a few bites. My husband got the striped bass- small portion and also very average. We got the muscles as our appetizer and that was def the best thing we tried. The cocktails were too sweet. 

Above all, the service was painfully slow- not an enjoyable experience at all. We're visiting NC, have been here for 5 days and this was our last dinner and by far our worst restaurant experience. We started our trip at kindred (which is amazing) and were hoping since it's owned by the same family that it would be worth trying, it's not."}
{"text":"I went to the bar to have a drink due to wait time and decided not to stay. First let me say the noise level was horrible so loud you had a hard time having a decent conversation. Second the price. They touted this restaurant as a value compared to their other restaurant in Davidson. Not so. I'm sorry 15 dollars for an Old Fashioned in Cornelius NC is just too much. The drink was fine but don't tell me this is going to be a family friendly restaurant with good pricing and charge me 15 dollars for a drink. Sorry just not what I thought it would be I won't be back."}
{"text":"Fried food only expensive...serve food on hospital tray (berk)- long john slivers is cheaper if you are looking for that kind of food - the view is good though"}
{"text":"Absolutely cannot say enough good things about this place. I am shocked by the negative reviews, but they mostly seem to focus on the limited menu and the price (which was not ridiculous, in my opinion). 

We got there just before they opened so got to enjoy the beautiful Charlotte weather by sitting on the open patio closest to the water (they have two patio sections, one open and the other covered). The decor of the restaurant was super cute. I loved the retro theme. 

We decided to basically split two smaller plates and a main. Based on our server's guidance, the hamachi was our first choice. It was damn good. The forbidden rice gave it an interesting textural element, and the flavors were outstanding. We also tried the sunchokes and caviar, which were perfectly cooked and served over creme fraiche. Did the lobster roll for the main...wow. The Kindred milk bread paired excellently with fresh delicious lobster. We tried the tasty beef fat fries and added a side of the perfectly seasoned watermelon al pastor. For dessert, we did the funfetti cheesecake, which was a lighter take on traditional cheesecake. 

Besides the food, the drinks were also excellent. Tiki-style cocktails did not disappoint us. 

And the service was great. Our waiter was very helpful, friendly, and welcoming. He was present without being obtrusive. 

All in all, this was an amazing culinary experience. Easily one of the best restaurants we've been to. I only wish we lived closer! 

So ignore the critics, grab your credit card, and try this place. If you like innovative bold flavors, you'll really enjoy it."}
{"text":"What a great find! My friend Kelly and I took a trip to Lake Norman to celebrate her birthday weekend and wanted to find a restaurant near the water. We couldn't have gotten luckier with this gem! 

Such a cute retro, Miami Vice- yet modern vibe with indoor and outdoor seating overlooking the docks. The outdoor seating is all covered with heat lamps during the cooler months, by the way. 

In terms of the service, everyone was super friendly and kind. We even got some free soft serve for Kelly's birthday! 

We ended up getting the same exact meal: We both got cocktails, the Subterranean Spritzer, as featured in the photos. Also, we both got what they call a \"Snaquiri\" aka a mini shot of your flavor preference!

For meals, we both got the Number 1 platter and LOVED IT! Fried and delicious. Light batter. Only iffy thing was the catfish batter wasn't very salty. But the dipping sauce and avocado slaw totally made up for it. 

To top everything off, there is an adorable photo booth in the restaurant. You're welcome."}
{"text":"All of you people need to understand this place is literally killing the game. This isn't kindred and that's fine. They took a Carolina fish camp and made it super relevant to today's culture. Katy and joe you guys are doing awesome things for Charlotte food culture! Thanks for making something that feels just as much Carolina as it does California."}
{"text":"Third time to Hello Sailor, food is still delicious (tried hush puppies this time, not dense, great)! Ordered 2 Margarita's (1 shot each). $34 for 2!!!

Price on drinks needs to be reviewed. I know where to go...p"}
{"text":"The Kindred's have outdone themselves. Loved this place! The food, atmosphere, and service were on point. We almost decided not to go because of the negative reviews and I am so glad we did. I strongly encourage you to go and form your own opinions."}
{"text":"Service and food were so-so. Price is a bit much for what you actually get. It's a bit overly loud within the restaurant. Fries were the best part, and the design of the restaurant is pretty cool! Definitely expect Lake-time service and enjoy your drink for a while!"}
{"text":"Whoever gave this restaurant anything lower than 5 stars.. I have no idea where you ate. I went to Hello Sailor for the first time last night with some friends and we loved every single thing we ordered.. and we tried a lot of different dishes! We started with the hamachi which was full of flavor and had an unexpectedly awesome crunch, the hush puppies (like eating clouds omg) and the deviled crab dip - how can you go wrong with pimento cheese+crab? You can't. We also had the ribs, scallops, and oysters, which were all wonderful. On top of the amazing food, the service was impeccable. Check out hello sailor and don't listen to the bad reviews. They aren't true."}
{"text":"As most other reviews have stated, way overpriced and very limited menu. My wife and two kids (9 & 12) popped in for dinner yesterday evening. We ordered the crab dip first. For $12 thought it would be large serving, but it was small and came with \"Captain's Wafers\" crackers. She had the catfish (3 chicken tender size pieces) and didn't include a side for $15. She ordered the avacado slaw for $5 which wasn't very flavorful either. One of my kids had the mac-n-cheese which at $3.50 was the best value of the night. The other had the kids burger with fries, I had the skillet burger with fries, which was good, but not great. I had 2 beers, my wife had 1 and we were at $90.00 without tip, so well over $100 with tip (server and staff were great. Very friendly). 

Great lake views, and the restaurant is nicely updated since it used to be the Rusty Rudder. Need more menu items, and prices seem too high for what you get."}
{"text":"Insanely good food! The Himachi is off the charts. Seafood is fresher than fresh. The burger is unreal. Service is top notch. Location is gorgeous. Decor is chic. A win all around!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is beautiful and the food was delicious. I've been so excited to go here!!! However, I have to say that I was a bit turned off by their unwillingness to accommodate easy requests. They refused to bring a side of avocado for my baby. Of course I was willing to pay for it, but they had the manager come over and tell me that \"if they did that for me they would have to do it for everyone\". Really? He's 7 months old. Give the baby some avocado.  PS - it was 4pm and relatively empty, so not like they were slammed and didn't have a spare minute to help us figure something out. Just seems to me it could have been handled better."}
{"text":"Their fried shrimp is literally popcorn shrimp... so low quality. The food is way over priced for what you get. I am happy to pay top dollar for some good food but this place doesn't have it."}
{"text":"I planned a birthday dinner at Hello Sailor for some family and it was a great time! Absolutely in love with the atmosphere and customer service was awesome. After being seated for a while they were very quick to accommodate to our number of people changing. Food was amazing! We had the hush puppies, blue crab claws, grilled caesar salad, citrus crab louie salad (one of the best salads I've ever had), and the skillet burger with beef fat fries (YUM). Also, the drink menu is on point and they come in fun glasses. At the end of the meal they brought out two complimentary birthday ice creams that were delicious. Definitely won't be the last time we visit!"}
{"text":"After waiting for months for Hello Sailor to open, we could not have been more disappointed.  The ribs were dry and over cooked, the shrimp was clearly frozen and re-thawed (not fresh), the appetizer was so salty I couldn't taste anything but salt.  The plastic cups and food baskets are an embarrassment.  I would like to add that it is overpriced, but I have no desire to return even if the food were free.  If you are interested in a restaurant on the water, try Port City Club or North Harbor Club instead."}
{"text":"Best hush puppies ever! The mixed drinks are stellar. The poke bowl is fantastic. It is supposed to be nothing fancy and good food and I think they totally pull that off. This summer is gonna be amazing for them on the water.
All the people who are disappointed about the price; really? The hush puppies are $3.50. Barring the steak and the crab legs nothing is over $22. The drinks are in the $9-12 range which considering the execution and ingredients is reasonable. 

Also, let's not mourn the loss or compare to Rusty Rudder. They are different beasts all together. Everyone loves a dive bar but that place smelled of spoiled beer and vomit. If they didn't change things, I would worry about their intention."}
{"text":"Kind of disappointing since I'm such a big fan of Kindred & was hoping for the same caliber of dining (but with different food, obviously) but this was just a let down. 

I LOVED the decor. And our server was wonderful. But the food was overpriced for the small portions. 

We started with the crab dip, and the portion was tiny for $12.99. It was mostly filler and was less than an inch thick in the small serving dish. It was served alongside a handful of individually wrapped packs of crackers. 

As for our entree, we asked about the portion size of the platters - because for $24 for fried fish, you expect it's going to be a LOT of food. Our server told us it depended on how hungry we were, but that it was more than enough food to share , but if it turned out not to be enough, we could order another side of flounder or shrimp. So, we went with that. When it arrived it was a small tray, loaded with fries, some popcorn shrimp and one. piece. of flounder. We asked if we could order another piece of fish. She leaves and another woman comes out and tells us that they can't do one more piece of fish since the platters are already portioned out, but she's going to have them send out a whole other platter, but she'll adjust the price. 

Well, we ate most of it. Except the second mountain of fries. When we got our check, we were charged $48 for both platters. We didn't say anything, because we did eat most of the second platter, but it was really annoying since we never would have ordered the whole second platter. Especially since we didn't order it. They ordered it for us & never asked if we wanted the whole thing. So, $91 for about 4 tablespoons of crab/cheese dip, two platters of mostly French fries, and drinks."}
{"text":"So I'm usually not inclined to write reviews of restaurants, regardless of whether I like them or not. I choose to vote accordingly with my money and repeat visits. However, after reading a lot of the negative reviews, I felt compelled to share my thoughts. Before I do, rest assured I'm not attacking anyone's opinions as I respect them all. I just feel some are silly.

Bottom line, I love this place...and not because I waited a while for it to open and wanted to love it. But because it's different, random...and very good.

Simply walking into the newly renovated space was a big surprise. After years of enjoying the Rusty Rudder, I was pleased to see the funky new decor, and that the usual Rudder smells of urine and infidelity were gone. I love the post-modern Jetson's feel, all the way down to the bar and plastic water glasses.

The service at the bar was great! And I'm not just saying that because they offer 40 ounce Miller High Life Bottles in champagne buckets. Although that helps! The drinks were cold and quickly refilled. I prefer eating my meals at the bar and the food service was equally as quick and painless. I'm a huge Kindred fan, but wasn't expecting an exact replica. The menu is small, yes, but what's on there is fantastic. The hush puppies were very different and really good, and I could eat the gumbo daily. I look forward to going back regularly!

This place isn't trying to be everything to everybody. Yes, it's a tough go if you are a vegetarian. Yes, it's not accommodating as far as substitutions/modifications if you are a picky eater. The menu is the chef's creation...your paying for his/her craft. It's not up to me to change that. If I don't like something as it is, I won't eat it. Or I'll eat at home or somewhere else. I'm an adult and respect the skills of talented people. And these are talented people, and I'm happy to live so close to such a unique place."}
{"text":"Sadly not a great place for lunch or dinner.  The first trime I tried to check out Hello Sailor, our party of 9 was turned away with an hour and a half wait on a Sunday evening at 5pm.  A group of girlfriends and I went a few weeks later and I spent 25.00 on lunch alone (no cocktails).  The dish I had was a salad and the dressing had an off-taste which stayed with me the remained of the day.  Too expensive for what you get.  Found the seating minimal for the space, and the server staff less than welcoming."}
{"text":"Drinks were amazing. Food was delicious. Company was incredible. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"After seeing so many mixed reviews we were reluctant to try having had such a great experience at Kindred. How pleasantly impressed we were when everything completely exceeded our expectations. Hush Puppies, Pickles, Shrimp & Flounder and of course the drinks. Couldn't have asked for a better night!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  We came here with my wife three different times and last week we were at a table outside with view on the lake and it was a blast.  

Food is delicious, I especially recommend the hamachi crudo, the Caesar salad and the hush puppies.  But the best part are the cocktails and the setting.  The tiki drinks are a blast.  If you have ever been to Lake Tahoe you will recognize the vibe: amazing views, strong tropical drinks and boat drive in.  Service is great, unlike Kindred which can be a hit or miss nowadays with the increased popularity and how crowded it gets.

People complain on Yelp that it is nothing like Kindred, but this place was not meant to be a twin of the sister Restaurant.  It's the fun sibling.  The vibe is casual, the whole experience feels like being on vacation.  I don't really understand complaints about the price too when you have delicious sandwiches for $13.  Stay away haters, I will be at Hello sipping on my Mai Thai watching the sun setting on the lake."}
{"text":"If you are expecting Kindred at the lake, think again.  Service tonight was horrible and no one seemed to care.  Apps came before the drinks and meals before salads, get the picture? Don't expect a fine dining experience, and don't expect to feel special.  A real shame given the gorgeous location."}
{"text":"I wanted so much to love this place.  I think I may have just gotten my hopes up too high... but shouldn't I have?  

The decor is a good 50/50 split among the community. However, I absolutely love it.  The mid-century modern Miami-Vice vibe meets my psuedo-hipster lifestyle.

The food though... I think it is fair to expect great, consistent, flavor from the same restaurant group. Go to Burrito Loco and The Prickly Pear... and you get amazing flavor from both.  I had the same expectation here.  I love seafood and I love me some fried food.  The hushpuppies were fine but I wasn't a fan of the squishy texture.  For dinner, I had the catfish and added the avocado slaw... The flavor of the fish itself was really good.  I was stoked bc I hadn't had catfish in about 20 years (honestly, who every has it on their menu?). The batter that it was cooked in wasn't very exciting so that was just a bit of a bummer.  The slaw, though... I would go back just for the slaw. Creamy and delicious and very, very, flavorful. Keep in mind that I do not enjoy your traditional cole-slaw.  I also stole a few bites of my wife's creamed collards.  While there wasn't anything creamy about them, they were delicious... another item that I would go back for.

Overall, the food was okay and the vibe was great.  The servers and staff really seem like they are trying their best to get everything right.  I might try it again or just go for drinks, which I hear are great."}
{"text":"A cute restaurant that actually tastes good. 

We live in an age where Instagram-worthy restaurants are booming, which has its pros and cons. It looks great, but does it taste good?

Hello Sailor is a cute, trendy restaurant with a friendly staff and good food (and killer cocktails!). 

I got Platter #2 because go big or go home, and it was delicious! Definitely recommend the shrimp and if you're looking for a nice refreshing cocktail, get the Aperol Spritz! 

Your wallet might not thank you afterward, but your stomach sure will. It's a nice treat on a Saturday afternoon - but come early because it gets a little crowded during lunchtime! 

Can't wait to come back when the patio is open!"}
{"text":"Visited Hello Sailor over the holidays and just loved the vibe of this new Lake Norman eatery. So fresh and fun. The mid-century design fits the beautiful lake front setting perfectly. Can't wait for summer! Loved the spin on fish camps. The hush puppies are truly unique and unlike any I have tried with the very light texture and sweet/savory butter. Don't like honey butter generally, but this was not the usual. The chicken wings were crispy with an excellent sauce - this is something else I am not generally a fan of, but the texture of these wings won me over.  Deviled crab dip was both cheesy and crabby - delicious! I loved the Calabash shrimp- it is salty fried goodness. I look forward to trying more of the menu. The high wall bench at the corner table is not wide enough for sitting comfortably. There is no foot rest and it hits your thighs at a place that hurts when your legs are dangling, but this is fixable and really only relevant to that particular table, so I still am bullish on this fun new restaurant so beautifully located on Lake Norman."}
{"text":"Not coming back EVER!!! The radio was constantly playing bad indie rock music. The food was unbearable. I ordered a burger and after one bite I almost spat it back out. It tastes like rubber. There's a random picture of the singer from nirvana on the wall. The bathrooms have no toilet paper. The restaurant has a awkward menu for the look of the place."}
{"text":"My two friends and I were the very first guests on opening night, and I've been back again with two different friends. First night... We tried drinks, appetizers, main course, and dessert. The service was great! Our server was quick and knowledgeable. The atmosphere is distracting and beautiful! Well done and a far cry from the Rudder. My first letdown was the deviled crap dip. The dip itself was delicious, don't get me wrong, but the vehicle that it was driving on didn't match. It was like a BMW trying to drive with a pinto engine. Things just didn't match up. The dip was served with Lance crackers (or the like) still in their wrapper. I know I'm not at a fine dining restaurant, but I didn't think I was at Steak N Shake pouring my oyster crackers over chili. Okay, rant over about the crackers...it would just be better with something a little more tasty than that! Pita chip, maybe? I had the Ribs and Calabash shrimp plate served with avocado slaw. The ribs were pretty good, but they are not the best I've had. The rub was on point, but not quite as moist as I'd prefer. The shrimps were very good, as was the slaw. My dessert hand pie was good but not great. This may fall under a personal preference, but the filling was not a good ratio to the pastry, and I think the filling was a bit tart. I spent close to $100 on myself that night (drink, app, dinner, and dessert...) it really didn't live up to the price tag. 

Second time I came, I tried to stay on the lower end of things. I ordered the chicken sandwich, and while I applaud the freshness (crisp pickles and crunchy breading that is Calabash) it's just, meh. The sesame buns are pretty fun but not something that I feel contributes to the flavor. I can live without the food here. Their salad was yummy but when's the last time you heard someone recommend a restaurant for a side salad? 

Would I return? Absolutely. The location begs your company, and for the price of their sandwiches (not their plates) you can get a good lunch on the lake. But it's not a place I'm ready to rave about. I'm open to improvement because their still new-ish. 


Update: tried it for a third time, and for me it wasn't a charm. I ordered hush puppies, the burger with salad, and creamed collards. For dessert I ordered their seasonal hand-pie which was bananas foster. 

Here's me keeping  it short and sweet. I was annoyed that my salad couldn't come out early. I requested it to come out before my burger (because last time I was here, that is how it was served, which I liked) and I was told it couldn't because it was served on the same plate. Head scratch. Once it arrived it was in a bowl, and why that couldn't have come out earlier? Beats me. 

Second issue, my burger tasted like a Whopper from Burger King. Whatever the secret sauce is probably makes this true. The burger itself with the pickles were good, but the sauce...all I could think of was the Whopper 

Third issue was my collards. While I applaud them for flavor, they didn't meet expectations. They were \"creamed collards\" on the menu, so I was expecting something much creamier than I received. It was your typical collards with bacon and breadcrumbs on top. I liked them (husband LOVED them), but like I said, they weren't creamy. So, either cream it up or change the name. 

Finally, the hand-pie. It was truly yummy. While there was excess cinnamon sugar on the outside (for my preference) the filling was delicious. I loved it. It's not enough to change my mind about the 3 stars."}
{"text":"Love Kindred....unfortunately this isn't anywhere close to the quality. The non fried items were GOOD but anything fried should be left to a chef that knows what they are doing. They should pivot to fresh, healthy seafood and leave the fried stuff to the fish camps."}
{"text":"Me and my fiancé visited hello sailor this evening for dinner, it was the first time we had eaten there since it opened. We were huge fans of the Rusty Rudder. 

Let me start by saying that there is nothing that the wait or bar staff could've done better to improve our experience. We sat outside at the tiki bar for drinks to start and then the weather was so nice we decided to just eat out there! The bartender/waitress we had, Murphy, was absolutely wonderful and very attentive to all the dinner customers, as well as the bar customers. 

Our disappointment lays in the menu. We ordered a house salad with sautéed shrimp and their chicken sandwich. My fiancé had asked if he could add bacon to his sandwich and was told that unfortunately the kitchen wouldn't allow any \"additions\" to menu items. Then I asked if I could have a different dressing option for my house salad, as I can't have ranch due to allergies, and was told that that's their only dressing option but the waitress thinks she can find some oil and vinegar in the back if that'll work. So, rather than have a bare salad- I opted for the oil and vinegar. Our food arrives and my fiancé notices that his chicken sandwich needs a sauce so, naturally being NC, he requests BBQ sauce... only to be answered that they don't have BBQ sauce that they only have ketchup- no honey mustard, no BBQ sauce, just ketchup. 

All in all, our food was good and the service was great... we just needed more accompaniment options and menu variations- like no BBQ sauce, are you serious?"}
{"text":"Beautiful location and restaurant with delicious inventive food and excellent service!!  Top notch!"}
{"text":"The decor and atmosphere are great. We had very good service and the food was good. I feel like the prices are high and they try too hard with the specialty cocktails."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this restaurant because we LOVE Kindred, but it's not even in the same ballpark. The view of the lake is wonderful, and I would go back to the Tiki bar for drinks, but having my dinner served in a plastic basket like fast food is not cool. It's trying too hard to be cool and not succeeding, very underwhelming."}
{"text":"It's just okay. Prices are high and food is too fancy for the lakefront setting. Food is decent... but no \"wow\" factor here.

This restaurant was a Great Lake rest"}
{"text":"Im torn here.. but giving four stars as I'm into the vibe and what the Kindreds are trying to make happen with an old favorite \"the rusty rudder\".  The place itself is decorated beautifully with a gorgeous upgraded patio! The drinks seem to be delicious although I'm currently pregnant and working with mock-tails... which was still SO good! My friend and I started with the hush puppies- enjoyable and yummy, but not a ton either! I ordered the burger which to me was a step up from a five guys burger (which i do love by the way) and came with a salad as my chosen side. While the food was good, it was served on THE tiniest old school platting option of a tiny wooden salad bowl and a extra small cafeteria tray. I feel this game needs to be stepped up as any food that fell inevitably fell outside of the small plate and onto the table. I will def be back, the food was good for sure- just not sure if I'm into the prices for the food... or the rest of the menu options! We'll see!"}
{"text":"Whoever did the marketing and branding for this restaurant did a fantastic job. Everything from the wrap around the napkin to the postcard they give you on your way out has their logo and colors on it. It definitely is eye catching.

The atmosphere of this place is also one of a kind! Theres a ton of outdoor space both covered and uncovered and you get all types of people. People coming of the lake or stopping by with families. The views are amazing and the tiki bar looks like a fun hangout spot. It looks like tons of people dock their boats and stop by!

The food was another story. I was surprised at the lack of options that were available for food and how expensive it was. $15 for a basket of fried shrimp that doesn't come with a side is a little much. In fact none of their entrees come with sides, only sandwiches do. And while their portions are big I don't want to pay $17 for a caesar salad with chicken. The crispy chicken sandwich and the fried shrimp were both good (I thought the hush puppies were overrated for how much they're talked about) but overall the food was nothing special.

I would come back for drinks to enjoy the view or stop by if on the lake for the day. But I don't know that I would rush back here to eat again."}
{"text":"The positive is the place looks nice and provides nice views of the lake.

The negative is basically what many others have said about being overpriced for what your getting.  We got the new Florida Blue Crab claws as an appetizer, but it was very little meat and your picking shells out of mouth every bite.  Definitely not worth $13.50.  The seafood platter I got was a ton of fries and a marginal amount of fried shrimp and 1 fried flounder.  It tasted good but it feels like your paying $24 for something you would get at Long John Silver's.  My wife got the lobster roll which she said tasted good, but again it's a small lobster roll for something that costs $30.

I'd go back if they change up the menu to provide dishes that are more on par with what they are charging.  For what they offer now it just seems way overpriced for what you are getting."}
{"text":"Pros:
Great location
Great food
Great service

Cons:
Bit of a drive from Charlotte - but so worth it!
Not really a con, but they use spiced rum in the Mai Tai.. just a heads up. Not what I was expecting.

Will I go back? Definitely! This is a great spot. We enjoyed a leisurely late lunch with a few cocktails. Great spot for seafood, but they have other options as well. I love the vibe. It's sort of vintage, but very relaxed! Our staff was so friendly and we got our food and drinks quickly. Kudos Hello Sailor!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic place! Such a positive change! Exactly what this place needed. And the food is amazing, all local and fresh. Did not know what to expect but very pleasantly surprised. Definitely a new date night spot! We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Frankly, I'm surprised, but not shocked by other reviews. More detail as I continue, but I'll start simply: Eat here, the food is very good and the atmosphere is very cool.

I've really enjoyed eating at Kindred over the last few years, and was very excited for Hello Sailor to open. I made the trek here on opening weekend, around 8 PM, and was pleasantly surprised that our party of three was able to sit at the bar within about 5 minutes. I really enjoyed a Negroni Slushie to start and then the house beer by Free Range and the rest of our party enjoyed their cocktails. Yes, the cocktails are about $12 on average - this is, however, not a chain restaurant. It's a nationally acclaimed chef opening a second restaurant that they've completely renovated - this should be expected. For food, we shared the hush puppies, which are really light comparative to others I've eaten, the sunchokes and caviar, unreal good, and calabash shrimp and fries, better than I've eaten for the same price at similarly situated waterfront restaurants. All in all, we were very happy.

I came back for lunch today, and really enjoyed the burger. Another reviewer noted that the meat was gray, which is just incorrect. The burger is well done with two thin patties, and is an emulation of a Big Mac, so it makes complete sense to me. The beef tallow fries are also a throwback to the pre-saturated fat meltdown, and are really delicious and more flavorful than anything you'd get with peanut oil or something like that. I also felt like the portion was completely justifiable for the $12 price point (again, you're not at a burger chain).

I'm excited to see the spring and summer here; the outdoor patio looks awesome and they've got 12 boat slips for people coming in from the lake.

Looking forward to my next meal here."}
{"text":"Loved the place just went to visit my son he took me here to have a drink  it was delicious  my youngest son loved the hush puppies we will visit again and my son will have to take us back. I loved it service was awesome everyone was extremely friendly"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about my amazing experience at Hello Sailor. This will definitely be one of my new go-to places! The hushpuppies were some of the best I've ever had. I ordered the Platter No1 and the black drum was delicious. Our waiter was extremely helpful in answering all of our questions and making sure we were happy with our drink choices."}
{"text":"Ok before I get started let me say this. I visited this restaurant for the first time with 4 of my close, strong opinionated friends and when we get together it's always a lot of laughs, talking, and easily some confusion lol. Ok now to the review.

This was my first time visiting this restaurant but I know it's the sister restaurant to Kindred which I've heard great things about so I was definitely excited about visiting this restaurant. We actually went for lunch on this particularly day. Upon approaching the restaurant, the exterior was white yet chic. One of my friends remembered when this location was the Rusty Rudder and was actually surprised at how they had transformed this location (\"the bathroom used to be over there\" she said).

The interior décor of this location was really cool and had an 80's vibe. There is cool lights and furniture and even a photo booth (check out the pics). The restaurant itself however is not very big. Ok let's talk about the food...so this was a Wednesday and I was living on the edge since it was hump day so I ordered the Skillet Burger with Beef Fat Fries (I paid for this later at the gym when I almost passed out). My group of friends ordered primarily the Skillet Burger or the Calabash Chicken sandwich. Fast forward to how the food taste. We ordered the hushpuppies as an appetizer and I thought it was just ok. Something was missing with the hushpuppies and I really don't know what but I wouldn't order them again. My burger arrived and it was slightly undercooked and so was my friend's burger. We actually ended up sending it back however they were very accommodating and apologetic. When we finally received our food, the burger was pretty good not the best burger I've ever had but good. There are a million sesame seeds on the bun though so don't be alarmed. The fries were hot and fresh. From our conversation with the waiter they tend to cook their burgers on the medium side so if that is a problem for you rethink your choice or discuss with your waiter/waitress. Overall, I rate the food a B as I would definitely give the food another try and I loved their eclectic menu.

Customer service was fantastic our waiter was attentive and because we sent the burgers back due to them being undercook the manager actually comp'd our entire table which was a great surprise. Of course, we paid it back to the waiter but this just goes to show that the manager cares about our experience and wants us to visit this location again which I will.

The restaurant sits right on the water and will have a balcony opening soon just in time for the warmer weather. I'm giving this restaurant 4 stars as the food was good, décor was not average, customer service was great, and they will soon have a balcony with great views right off the water."}
{"text":"Perfect!  Enjoyed a great dinner with 4 friends. We were seated promptly & received excellent service from our waiter. One friend had a food allergy & our waiter went above & beyond to work with her.  All of our cocktails were delicious, the hush puppies and avocado slaw were great! Definitely order a hand-pie! Yum!!!  Be ready to snap pictures of everything, the decor at Hello Sailor is gorgeous. Can't wait to enjoy it even more in the warmer months!"}
{"text":"Came here this weekend and was blown away by the variety of options and tastes across all different price points. The burger was delightful and extremely reasonably priced considering it came with these amazing beef fat fries! If you were considering skipping dessert, dear god don't do that. The homemade hand pie literally changed my life. It was this flaky crunchy soft moist flavor explosion of whoa! It was pear and something else I couldn't spot....bourbon? Hmmm. Amazing.    I also got the side of watermelon which had this interesting spice mix. Basically the non-alcoholic food version of one of my favorite cocktails....probably not for the non-adventurous though, but I absolutely loved it. Definitely get the homemade pickles too. Very cool place!"}
{"text":"Service was good, as expected. Menu left a lot to be desired. Limited options. Beer was cool, at best, and flat. It was okay. Overall, it was not bad, but not great."}
{"text":"I don't write many reviews, but I LOVE Hello, Sailor.  I've been a few times now and the food and drinks have been amazing each time.  The menu changes often, which is great - I love trying something new every time.  I have a few food allergies and they were very helpful, even taking the menu back to the kitchen and highlighting items that I could order. Some items are pricey, but that's what happens if you want fresh and delicious seafood - it's worth it!  And not to mention the decor - so beautiful!"}
{"text":"After all the hoopla surrounding the new sister Kindred restaurant, we were very excited to be able to have dinner here on Saturday! What a disappointment! We were seated at the ridiculous banquette, your legs just hang from the bench. When I asked for a table, the manager said they were reserved, later finding out they do not take reservations. Menu was disappointing! They supposedly brought a chef from Charleston. I lived in Charleston for many years. This is not Charleston cuisine. The lobster roll was acceptable as were the fries. Won't be back!"}
{"text":"Omg what an improvement from the Rusty Rudder! I came here for dinner and I knew going in there would be a wait and we wouldn't be able to substitute anything on the menu and it was still an exceptional experience. The food is amazing, the service is great, and the atmosphere is exactly what we were looking for. Based on how much we enjoyed it in the winter I can't wait to come back in the summer!"}
{"text":"They have one good thing on the menu and that's the lobster roll. I hope they soon realize a lot of people don't eat fried anything. Please get rid of or add choices that don't include breading. Get some grilled or broiled food. If not I'll return occasionally for the one good thing but way overpriced lobster roll."}
{"text":"Hello Sailor is a great place to enjoy beautiful views of the lake, delicious food and a wonderful wait staff. This was our 1st visit and we thoroughly enjoyed our evening! We began our evening with cocktails and appetizers (loved the oyster rockefeller). Seafood and fish is their specialty. We ordered the shrimp and flounder combination platter, which was very tasty. We will return and recommend Hello Sailor!"}
{"text":"A joy filled experience. The heart of this place is to make you feel like you've come home or that you are getting ready to set out on a new adventure. The scallops & parsnips were delicate & bright, and the mezcal cocktail had beautiful heat. 
We can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Well I've worked my way through almost the whole menu, but since they keep changing seasonal items, I'll have to keep coming back! A burger or chicken sandwich for lunch or ribs and wings from their smoker -- that's all great stuff -- but it's the seafood that's the reason to return. Oysters, clams, hamachi crudo, sole -- serious food in a fun place. And the. best. hush. puppies. ever."}
{"text":"I've now eaten here about 5 times and feel like I can give a solid review. We wanted to love this restaurant, but unfortunately it was a big miss for us. Pros: the wings and chicken sandwich are great
Cons: the menu options are totally odd for a lakeside restaurant. Super bummed there aren't fish sandwich options regularly or peel and eat shrimp, things you look for when you get off of the boat. I mean a bologna sandwich?! Come on. We came in and had a party of 9. 4 people within the party ordered an Italian sandwich and all 4 left half of the sandwich due to lack of flavor. Super bland. The decor is also a super odd concept but could get past that if the food was good. Serving food on prison trays at the price points just isn't a fit. Sadly this was not the restaurant we were hoping for for Lake Norman."}
{"text":"I will happily pay good money for good food, but Hello, Sailor didn't fit the bill. After waiting an hour for our table because there are very few tables indoors, we ordered appetizers. The crab dip was actually really good, but paying $12 for a small bowl and getting packaged Captain's Wafers as the only item to dip was a little more than silly. Our entire table had a good laugh about it, but seriously? A little effort there would have been nice. Then, although this is touted as a seafood restaurant, the waitress didn't have any idea where the shrimp was caught when we asked while giving our orders. I ordered it anyway, and it was good too. But then I found a really long hair in the shrimp. They did the right thing and comp'd the dish, but my taste for the restaurant was ruined.

I love the idea of this place and would love to see it get better, but right now it's definitely not where it should be."}
{"text":"Extremely overpriced and the food is not very good.  My salad was $23. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"This is a great lakeside spot. The hush puppies are to die for, the burger is the best - unassuming & just plain delicious. The lobster roll is as good as you'll get anywhere & the milk bread is SO GOOD. The service and the cocktails are perfect. And it's less than 30 mins from uptown! We love it here"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great, but probably will only go back for drinks at the outside bar. I felt the food was overpriced and average taste and flavor."}
{"text":"Just eh. I waited to go after Grand Opening due to the lines to get in. I heard mixed reviews but I had to try it for myself. Here are my thoughts:

1) It was lunchtime. We got right in at 12:45pm on a Wednesday. Good.
2) The male server was just ok...
3) I ordered the grilled ceasar salad; add shrimp. The flavor was very good. The shrimp was fried (interesting), would rather have grilled but not a choice. When my order came to the table everyone said \"Oh that looks really good.\" Mine looked better than most.
4) The rest of my group had various things which were all different and that was good because we were taste testing everyone's dishes. The Poke Bowl was a high nod by two guests who said they'd order it again. Another friend had the burger and she ordered this for her second dining experience. The trout was overpriced and small with a very small side. The guest was still hungry afterwards. Overall, food was good. Higher price point though. 
5) The menus are printed daily for both lunch and dinner on paper which is also your placemat. They do this because they constantly are tweaking the menu. The menu is small but you should be able to find something for everyone. No kids menu printed other than a verbal whip off from the server (we asked).
6) Atmosphere was LOUD. It was pretty much a full house all lunch. When one table left, someone immediately sat down afterwards. The person next to me I couldn't even hear her talking.
7) Decor is nice and different. I'm glad to see the remodel after knowing how the Rudder looked! THAT needed a major overhaul.
8) My only concern is how is this restaurant is going to do with lake traffic... I'm on the fence about that. I think the menu is overpriced for lake people. If they come out with a lunch lake menu, I think it will work. And music outside. Right now they say the menu is not changing to accommodate summer boats.
9) I think this will be a good place to sit at the bar and get an app with a friend.
10) I tried to make a reservation for a Mom's Night Out for 2nd Grade here for 20 people. They will not take reservations. First come, first serve. This sad because they lost our business as we needed a firm place to sit. We are now instead at a competitor restaurant."}
{"text":"Probably the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant. The server and hostess were so rude. I was with a large party with a very large bill. I asked for no fries because of my dietary restrictions and they refused to take them off my plate they still served me my food with fries. There were 10 of ya and they were going to make us sit at different tables we practically had to beg them to let us sit together. We haven't seen each other in 3 months. This was supposed to be such a fun night for our team and instead we were punished all night because we wanted to sit together. Hopefully they learn how to treat people. We have team dinners every time we're in Charlotte and we will never come back here. On a positive note it's nice sitting by the water."}
{"text":"Loved this place!! Super fresh and funky mid century modern vibe, tucked away on the water. We sat outside and loved the view. Our server was very friendly and 2-3 other ladies swing by our table to keep it today and fill our drinks. The food was delicious!! I had the fried bologna sandwich, and it was insanely good. Messy, but worth it. Reminded me of a Chicago dog. We also had the fried chicken sandwich, crab dip, and hush puppies. The apps were underwhelming but the frozen rum and ginger beer drinks made up for it. Overall amazing and I will be frequenting!"}
{"text":"Came with my friend for drinks because we saw some cool insta pics! We didn't get anything to eat though, since we're not seafood fans. They have a few non-seafood items but we just had drinks. The drink menu is interesting and unique, unlike other trendy bars that seem to have similar specialty cocktails. The backseat bingo had a cute little dolphin made from a banana. It had a banana liqueur and we shared it between the 2 of us. The snaquiris are made-to-order shooters that the bartenders whip up according to your tastes! That was fun and the bartender did great to create something we liked! Wish we lived in the area for happy hours by the water!!!"}
{"text":"Cool vibe (love the decor) but the menu seems out of sync with the decor and theme. Sat at the bar and our bartender Vince was awesome. But it was super loud - so loud that my husband and I had to repeat ourselves a lot and could hardly each other. Had the wedge salad, which was huge, and the calabash shrimp and both were really good. Cocktail options were unique and ours were well done. The menu just isn't what you'd expect, especially given how fabulous Kindred is. Hoping they'll add some more seafood options and broaden the menu a bit. We'll be back to give it another shot in the spring."}
{"text":"The WORST!!!!!!   Against the suggestions of our friends who ate here, we thought we should give it a try this evening.  Holy Cow!!  From the moment we walked in, we were hit with loudness!!!  We couldn't even hear ourselves talking!!  Had we been with friends, it would have been impossible to converse!!!  Terrible!!  Yes, it was a warm February evening, but no air conditioning at all!  Stifling!!  Hot and humid inside!!!!  Awful!!!!   Kids running around the bar because there is a photo booth located in the bar.  Annoying!!!!  The configuration of the inside dining area was all over the board!!!  Weird.  We didn't even finish our drinks and signed out!!!  Awful!!  No kidding....terrible, horrendous atmosphere and ambiance!  Wait, NO ambiance.
Also, the bar stools are the cheapest, most uncomfortable seats EVER!!  My husband, who is 6'6\" tall was afraid to lean back because there was no way the seat would support him!!  Even I, who is petite, was afraid to lean back!  Rickety and wobbly seats!!  And they are made of plastic waffle stuff.  If girls go there with shorts on, you will be walking around with marks on your thighs!!  Just cheap!!  
The only thing that I thought was halfway cool was the decor.  Someone went to Palm Springs.  Retro Palm Springs decor.  But wasted in this sh*t hole.  Friends told us to not eat there.  They ALL said the food was horrible!  What a shame.......we were so hoping for a new great restaurant.  
This was awful!!!!!!!!   Truly awful!!!"}
{"text":"Do more. It's 75 degrees outside. Why is the outdoor bar not open? Enough with this pretend fancy... Allow dogs! People with boats who spend money want to bring their dog. 3hour table outside wait for an appitizer consisting of saltine crackers  you're just forcing people to drive to Apps & Taps and Blue Parrot for proper lake vibes."}
{"text":"Wanted to try for a while now. Was surprised to get a table walking in on a Friday around 6:30. 
We had the fish with shrimp platter that is fried w fries and slaw. The shrimp and fish are local and tasted fine. The slaw was literally the size of half of a shot glass. They shouldn't even bother at that point. The ambiance is lacking big time. The room is one big open noisy room lit up like a cafeteria bright. The food was served on what reminded me of school lunch trays. They brought our craft beer in the can and we had to ask for a glass. 
The crab dip for $15.00 was tasty a bit too salty though and maybe a quarter cup of dip for the $15.00. 
The main reason we won't go back was the seating. The seats in main living room are the wicker type with hairpin legs. So uncomfortable I would imagine but we sat on the freezing porch and they had the old style cane chairs with aluminum rocker legs. Awful. Apparently they don't want anyone to sit comfortably or stay a while. 
They have a great location but while trying to be too retro they lost the comfort and ambiance. 
They should fix the seating and get some plants etc."}
{"text":"This place is awful. Service sucks . Food is mediocre at best and the portions are small. This place will be gone within 12 months . I'll be shocked if it isn't ."}
{"text":"Had a nice date night here at Hello Sailor.  We ordered the hush puppies, shrimp & flounder platter, lobster roll, and a hand pie with soft serve ice cream.  Everything was delicious!  
I second what other reviews have said about no substitutions.  We knew going in that we wouldn't have the beef fat fries (we don't eat beef) and they would not allow substitutions.  So the meal was smaller than expected.  We did order a side of the watermelon with chili and salt (very delicious).  
My other issue is that it is very expensive for what it is.  The price point needs to come down slightly.  I'm more than happy to pay that same price for a meal at Kindred, but it was a bit much here..  and really.. $10 for a beer?  We would have tried it otherwise.  I'd rather pay $10 for a cocktail than a beer, which is what we ended up doing!"}
{"text":"So as someone who lives close by to Hello Sailor we have been patiently waiting on the opening and we wanted to give them some time to hit their stride. We want Joe and Katy to be successful with this as we know how capital intensive giving the Rusty Rudder new life must have been and taking several months longer to open. Also know we are bar people. We like talking to other patrons and the bar staff when eating. Our first impressions are
1. The menu is way to heavy on fried seafood. Blackened, grilled, broiled choices would be nice. Also better selection of sides would be nice. 
2.Prices are upper mid-range. $25 for a #2 platter with a quarter rack of over cooked ribs and a hand full of nicely cooked shrimp and a thumbnail size of slaw side and over cooked fries seemed a bit underwhelming.
3. The appetizer of oyster Rockefeller was nice. 
4. The bar staff was amicable and helpful.
5. The palm springs retro 50's seafood concept gets lost on most people and comes across as upscale cafeteria. Nothing very warm about the ambiance. No lighting on the bar and no focal point behind the bar with lighting. And as my wife noticed, no under bar hooks for her pocketbook.??
6. Overall we came away under impressed and mostly disappointed. We were hoping for so much more as we have a shortage of good midscale restaurants in Cornelius and with HS in such a highly recognized location we hope they do some soul searching and adapt quickly."}
{"text":"First visit. Perfect day for the patio. Arrived by boat...so excited. Patio was FULL at noon fifteen! But inside was beautiful-full view of the lake! Rusty Rudder was immediately forgotten. And that was my highest point. Only 4 tables were occupied inside but we were seated beside the ONE support post that blocks the view of the lake. Oh well...new staff, things will get better. But they didn't. Now I know why EVERYONE is on the patio. The waiter had to repeat everything he said. I had heard it was noisy but WOW...but again, It was worth it for the view (minus the darn post!)  Time for the food...time for the fooooood...where the heck is the food? Ah! Here is mine but where is my partner's? Well don't fret, my fries are cold and I don't remember it being referred to as a COLD fried bologna sandwich. And finally the arrival of the overpriced, underwhelming lobster roll! Yea. Oh, no worries. We will just look at the ...oh, yeah...our pole. (Sad face).....Yes, we will return because we didn't come to Rusty Rudder for the food but we won't be back much. How much was that cold slab of bologna  again? And if you are seated at the table with a \"pole view \" of the lake remember that's my little table. Take good care of it. It's the one thing that delivered as promised."}
{"text":"After reading these posts, the expectations seem to have been for another higher-end Kindred, when it seems people should have expected a more relaxed, fun restaurant that was done well. The poke starter was amazing and we loved the mussels (outside of GoodFood probably the top in CLT). The chicken sandwich - yes, it was fried - was probably the best chicken sandwich I have ever had. And it was under $10, so the \"expensive\" complaints don't hold water. The ginger-cranberry fried pie dessert actually surprised us as to how good it was. There were some drink misses and more healthy options would be ideal for certain, but for what the Kindreds intended, Hello Sailor definitely delivered and was awesome. Will go back many times, and very excited to sit on the huge patio when it is nice or in the heated portion when it isn't."}
{"text":"I never had the opportunity to go to the Rusty Rudder, but I heard all the stories and how great the atmosphere was. We decided to give this restaurant a try. I thought the food was lacking a lot of flavor and extremely overpriced for the portion you receive. Our waitress was absent from the table and it's hard to tell who works there because they all dress completely different. The atmosphere is extremely loud and crowded due to the close proximity of the tables. I do not intend to eat here again, and will not recommend this place to anyone until they improve."}
{"text":"Lunch for two on a weekday which wasn't crowded (good tip!).  The mussels were very delicious and my dining companion really enjoyed her oysters rockefeller.  
Overall, I think it is a bit too pricey for lunch.  So, not an everyday sort of place."}
{"text":"Vegetarians: I hope you like advocaco coleslaw because that's the only option for you. Their french fries are even cooked in beef fat. A veggie burger with french fries would be a great option but they have NOTHING vegetarian friendly. They also don't have live music and never will; apparently that's a part of their agreement when leasing this space."}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday night.  Arrived at 5:45pm and had about a 30 min wait (no biggie).

The dining room is small but nice.  Bar seating isn't bad with a couple of tv's playing sports.  

We ordered a drink from the bar - I got a draft beer.  It didn't come in the traditional 16 oz pint glass, but instead a short highball glass.  I don't think it was 16 oz, but I think it was only $5 - so not horrible, just seems weird drinking a beer from a short glass.

We were sat and ordered.  Most got sandwiches/burgers, I got platter #2 (shrimp/ribs/fries).  Everything was good, but not great.  No one complained, but no one was over-the-moon about any of their choices.  Prices are good for a restaurant, but I'm interested to see how it evolves in the summer when boaters and everyone else flock in.

The food is served on these wood/plastic plates that made a few of us remember our grade school days.

The main contributors to the not great Yelp rating is that this place is not Kindred (in fact is seems far from it relative to quality of food) - I assume many visit Hello Sailor because of Kindred.  Also, there are many other just as good food choices on the water in the area (North Harbor Club and Port City Club).  

Honestly, I'd choose North Harbor Club out of the options currently."}
{"text":"Just amazed by the negative reviews but good to see that they haven't seemed to dissuade others from trying Hello Sailor and weighing in themselves.  Based on the uptick in Star rating lately, others are experiencing what I've now enjoyed six times.  Hello Sailor is literally my new favorite LKN area place to eat!

I smile at the comments about the limited menu.  Yes, go one time and it's relatively limited (And that in and of itself is not a bad thing when the food is executed well, AND IT IS!) but guess what?  Go six times spread out over a couple months and you'll find all kinds of new things to try.  The chef changes pieces of the menu up regularly and this is one of the things I like best about the place.

The vibe is low key but in a nice way vs the low key trashiness and horrid food that was Rusty Rudder.  

My only even slightly negative comment on the food at Hello Sailor is that I feel like the breading on the whole flounder works well but when it's also used on the smaller pieces of catfish, it's a little heavy.  There you go, that's it!  I have LOVED the rest of what I've tried and my wife is right there with me.

Thanks again Kindred's for another quality place here in LKN.  What's next? Hint, hint... :)"}
