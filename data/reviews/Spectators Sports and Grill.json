{"text":"It is a very good place to try. The price is very good and the portions are huge. You will have plenty to take home. It is very open and clean. Service was very nice as well. We are planing to go back again this weekend for dinner with the kids. If you go early enough its a great family resturant too!"}
{"text":"This is an old man's bar. Do not bring your wife/gf here. Definitely go across the street for much better atmosphere."}
{"text":"Spectators is the epitome of a great Cleveland sports bar. The walls are covered in sports memorabilia and pictures (even some local high school jerseys), the food menu is extensive and loaded with delicious somethings for any taste, and the drink selection is everything you'd want when watching the game. They  have a nice liquor selection and even a few wines!

I've come here ever since it opened and I've tried a good portion of the menu. You can seriously close your eyes, point to something on the menu, and land on something delicious.

Did I mention they have 13 big screen TVs, two projection screens, and Keno?

A+ in my book. I get out here whenever I can because no matter my mood, Spectators always has it covered."}
{"text":"My family and I went on Friday for their special fish fry menu. The filet was MONSTROUS! Seriously, it is about two meals worth. So, definitely worth your money. We also often get the ribs as takeout, because they are goooooooooooooood. 

So overall: Food was good. Environment was sports bar-y. Server was a hi-bye kinda guy, not rude but not welcoming either. Price was affordable for amount of food. 

P.s. Get the Fried Green Beans appetizer!!"}
{"text":"Good ol' Spectators is still hanging in there.  I've never seen this place completely empty probably because of their rotating specials that they run.  Now I haven't been there since the summer but all in all probably graced its presence a dozen times.  

The food at Spectators is typical of a sports bar.  They used to run a Sunday brunch and may or may not still do that.  I've heard its better then average with a cheap price tag.  I like the layout for both watching sports and bands which they have every weekend.  The last time I was there, a band called The Girls was playing and I really enjoyed myself.  I also go to pony up to the bar and play photo hunt while drinking a big beer and having myself a nacho.

People religiously go there so take that for granted when choosing whether to stop or not.  I think they have scratch off lottery tix and Keno too.  Nice bathrooms and a generally clean restaurant makes this place a top 5 option when cruising down SOM for lunch or to stop in for a little of the game."}
{"text":"Very cool place. First of all, it's huge; and it doesn't look that big from the outside. The location we went to (in Chesterland) isn't actually on Yelp; so I had to checkin at the nearby one, in WH. 
Hubby and I went there for lunch. Friendly, quick service; the portions are humongous! I couldn't even finish the chicken wrap and I was pretty hungry coming in.
Looks like a great place for all kind of occasions; dinner with friends, or even a family meal with kids.
Need to add the Chesterland location to Yelp!"}
{"text":"I've been visiting this place for a few months now, ever since we moved into the area. In fact most of the time this is our go to location, if we aren't in a mood for anything particular.
The place is big, everyone is very friendly. Good food, big portions, so you will almost always take some leftovers home.
I'm excited to add the Chesterland location to Yelp so I can check in at the proper location."}
{"text":"I was here for a birthday get together in the early spring, and there was a live band playing. My friends and I had a blast! I didn't have any food, so I can't review based on that. Seemed like your normal neighborhood bar though, service was good and the atmosphere had a fun vibe that night - maybe it was just us having a blast or maybe it was the band! I don't live close by so I don't know when I'd be back, but it was a decent place."}
