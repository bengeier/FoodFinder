{"text":"YUM!  Squash blossom hushpuppies followed by warm kale, fried goat cheese and beet salad, and a house made white bean burger with potaoes on the side.  Delish!  Loved sitting outside on the cute but small patio-- great people watching!  Love the cucumber water.  The veggie burger, while delicious, was way too big to eat as a burger.  The dipping sauce for the squash blossom hushpuppies was a bit disappointing.  Service was great.  Patio is cute; interior is small but quaint."}
{"text":"A wonderful experience! Presentation taste and quantity - all super! Service ambiance people - amazing! Overall a terrific place!  Will Be here again and again !"}
{"text":"As a manic yet guilty meat-eater, I've been on a 10-year plan to become a vegetarian for about 20 years now.  Haven't made too much progress but Fern gives me hope to \"win the future\" (that's a tag line I came up with recently, Obama stole it).   The roasted vegetable panini was out of this world - eggplant, zucchini, a delicious mozzarella cheese on a soft roll.  It came with a side (I got the quinoa salad) for $9 and it was a huge sandwich.  We also tried the Indian tacos, and as the other reviewers have said, they were great.  Also a huge portion and we had leftovers.  The \"hush puppies\" - we started with these and they were tremendous - melt in your mouth awesomeness. Good beer selection and then they have a whole array of specialty juices.  I guess juicing (legally) is all the rage nowadays.  People spend like $500 on juicers and supposedly after a week of juicing, people who are unhealthy and about to die become health gods.  We didn't try it, but maybe next time. Great location in Plaza Midwood, across the street from Bistro La Bon.  You might need to park in the big lot in front of Family Dollar and cross busy Central Avenue, but it's worth it.  Just don't do it while talking on a cell phone - we saw some girl do this and she dropped her bag and then she almost got hit by a car. Other items that sounded incredible were the bruschetta appetizer and the Buddha bowl.  You'll have to go to Fern to find out what's in it.  Nice people working there - very helpful and attentive.  This place has been open for a few days and they already had a wait on Friday night. Great addition to Charlotte."}
{"text":"First visit tonight and it won't be our last! The food and service were fantastic. I had the OM Buger, my wife had vegan spaghetti & meatballs, my stepson a flatbread and my stepdaughter the Fern Salad. We loved every bite! The Orange-ginger iced tea was quite tasty, too."}
{"text":"Delicious.  I had the om burger and my friend had the Buddha bowl.  Both were fabulous.  Great spot!!"}
{"text":"The ambiance of this place contributes to tasty food. The fern theme is evident throughout, and creates a calm and positive environment. As a vegetarian, it had a great selection and not simply the meat-less versions of food, with creative dishes. The gnocchi was excellent! A must!!"}
{"text":"Zucchini bolognese was delicious! I'm vegan and loved everything I tried. My carnivore father in law enjoyed it as well and went out of his was to say how good the fingerling potatoes were. Already planning a return trip!"}
{"text":"Fern is a lovely little restaurant with an intimate and charming atmosphere. The atmosphere was planned very well, right down to the silverware. There is also a nice little patio area with a roof.  All their food is vegetarian and most can be made vegan by request. They have a rather small menu, however the items on there have all be delicious every time. They also have a decent beer and wine selection.  The wait staff are very nice people. They are not only attentive but personable as well. Fern is a lovely place to visit or go for a date."}
{"text":"I love when new and different places open in Charlotte; it validates that we're a young, growing city on the rise.  Fern's decor is just what you'd expect from a vegetarian restaurant: welcoming and earthy, but not overly granola.  I'm sure this statement will come to bite me in the meat-eating rear when I can't flag down a waiter the next time I'm out, but the servers were almost TOO helpful.  We had a few different ones come to our table to introduce themselves, educate us on the juice menu, and just generally welcome us to Fern before we even ordered.  I like an attentive wait staff, but chill out there a bit, peeps.  The place was packed, which is a huge coup for lunch.  Although I easily found something I wanted to order, I wish there'd been more options on the lunch menu.  I previewed the online menu before heading over there, and a few of the key dishes that I was hoping to try are apparently only served at dinner.  That being said, what I had was delicious.  The flavors were like that brooding ex-boyfriend: deep and intense, and I mean that in the best way.  Between my friend and I, we ordered the bruschetta of the day (mushrooms and wonderfulness), the buddha bowl, and the om burger.  The toasted bruschetta bread was simultaneously crunchy and perfectly chewy; we seriously licked the plate clean, fighting over who got the last little bites.  The om burger was richly flavorful and the root  veggie chips were well seasoned, with some crispy and some chewy.  My friend loved her buddha bowl, although I thought it was a bit bland.  The folks from Something Classic have proved their range and skills extend to the meat-free variety.  Well done!"}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying I'm a total foodie and that one of my favorite things in life is to try out new (to me) restaurants. As a result, I'm easily at a new (to me) place at least once a week, often more so than that. Why am I telling you all of this? Because you need the context when I say - BEST RESTAURANT I HAVE TRIED IN THE PAST YEAR.  (Further context - in the past year, I've been in NYC, San Diego, Seattle, New Orleans, Nashville, Washington DC, and various parts of North Carolina and Virginia. And this place is better than anything I've tried in any of the aforementioned locations. It is THAT good.)  The first thing I noticed upon walking in was the ambiance and decor. The decor is simple, yet elegant, and just absolutely beautiful. I loved the mason jar \"chandeliers\" and the vertical garden.   Secondly, the menu is almost all vegan and none of the \"faux meat\" crap that you see in so many vegan restaurants. Though they have a veggie burger, it's a mix of real veggies versus a pile of processed junk. Fern really highlights the vegetables. From what I understand, they are all local and organic.   The menu is very creative and there truly seems to be something for everyone.   Finally, and most importantly, the food was outstanding. I had the tofu po'boy - the bun was soft on the inside, crispy on the outside, and appeared to be lightly grilled. The sprinkle of multi-colored sesame seeds added a nice little crunch and flavor. The cole-slaw on the inside absolutely made the sandwich. Mindblowingly delicious. Creamy and full of flavor. I would slather on everything.   I also ordered the kale salad with beets to go. Lots of texture and flavor.   I was too full for dessert, but next time I'm in Charlotte, I will be in Fern every single day."}
{"text":"So so so so so good. Can't recommend enough. I had the Buffalo Cauliflower, the Peanut Glazed Brussels, the Chicken Salad Sandwich, and the Pesto Panini. Seriously, everything was perfect. The service was amazing, I wish I remembered our servers name! He answered all of our questions and guided us through the menu. The portions are huge, the food fresh and the drink selection great. Vegetarian or not, go check this place out."}
{"text":"Awesome! Great Vegan Bavarian Cabbage with Spaetzel....wonderful vegan carrot cake! Tasted so great, didn't miss the animal products at all!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for Sunday brunch. The food was really delicious considering it was gluten and dairy free. I had the huevos rancheros and the hubs had an egg and \"pot roast\" hash. Both dishes had well-balanced flavor palates, and were surprisingly filling.   We enjoyed the cute decor of the place and the wait staff was very friendly. I only have two complaints:  1) there were some items on the menu that I asked about whether or not they were gluten-free. Two different servers weren't sure and had to go ask the kitchen. I feel that for such a specialized restaurant that boasts so many dishes to be dairy and gluten-free, the entire wait staff should be well-informed about all dishes. After all, a lot of their clientele are likely going to Fern for their alternative menu options.   2) this is perhaps a bit petty, but I find it very polarizing...most of the wait staff had VERY DIRTY HAIR. Now, I understand the whole organic/granola/healthy/hippie movement/most-people-shower-more-than-they-need-to thing, but come on! Wash your hair!! If you're serving me food, I don't want to be able to smell your dirty mop when you're walking toward me. Believe me, your delicious food and adorably earthy decor already speak volumes about how hipster y'all are. No need to underscore it by skipping the Pantene for a week. Just sayin.'   Those two small issues aside, I fully intend to visit this little gem again in the future and have already recommended it to a lot of my health-conscious (AND freshly showered) friends. :)"}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian.  In fact, I often tell people that I'm a MEATetarian (because carnivore isn't a fun word) .   However, I am open to interesting cuisines of all types... so my wife and I went to Fern a few weeks ago to see what it was all about.  The ambiance was great; really cute decor, and plants hanging everywhere.  The staff was super-friendly... everything felt quaint and cozy.  We each got a juice to start with.  I got something red which was a bit too sweet, and my wife got something green which tasted like a freshly mowed lawn smells.   I drank quite a lot of hers, mostly out of sheer amazement that it wasn't killing me.  The cuisine was all really imaginative and well executed.   This was easily the most creative restaurant we've been to in Charlotte.    We'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Great service and very good food. The black bean burger was crispy on the outside and dressed with a nice cilantro aioli. My wife loved her wilted kale salad, and the seitan steak has a nice, tender texture. Brussel sprouts and the buffalo cauliflower appetizers are recommended as well - large enough portions for a table of 4 to share. Downside is the place is small, so it can be a bit noisy and reservations can help avoid a wait."}
{"text":"I wanted to give it more than 3 stars, perhaps 3.5 or 4 but there were a couple things off with my experience. I'll start with the bad.   My boyfriend and had almost picked out exactly what we were going to get as soon as we got to the restaurant since we had checked out their menu prior to getting there. We got there, however, and they had run out of the hush puppies (app.). The other bad thing was the fact that after we ordered the bruschetta and specifically told the server we needed the vegan option for it she came back with the non-vegan and my boyfriend accidentally ate the cheddar cheese and was like \"Hmm, this tastes way too good, like really sharp!\". I mean it was actually kinda humorous but we let the server know and they brought us back the right one. The second one that came out, however, was kinda soft, not toasted/grilled enough, must've been because they really tried to rush it out in order to not aggravate us further? Anyhow, it wasn't bad, the flavors of it were there, just the texture of the bread was not what we were hoping for. The sweet potatoes gnocchi was definitely not something that stood out for me either. It was mehhh.   Now the good. Their Indian Tacos (app.) were pretty delicious. It was a large portion and I tend to get full easily but I could keep eating like a thousand of those things, okay not really but you know what I mean. The dough on the bottom reminded me of \"Sopaipillas\" which are a typical Chilean snack (which is where I was born). The beer  options were good. My boyfriend and I are obsessed with trying out good beers so that was a plus. Also, very reasonably priced, but I may be biased as we just moved down to Charlotte from NYC. Lastly, their desserts were pretty good, the chocolate cake more so than the beer donuts. The cake was perfectly moist and not too overwhelmingly sweet/rich. Probably due to the balance of the peppermint icing on top. I enjoyed this since I am not really a chocolate lover, at all.  Service was attentive. A little bit nervous and definitely not the most genuine but overall clear and concise. Will definitely give it another go and hope to give it a 4!"}
{"text":"I just wasted $80!  My friend and i tried this new vegetarian place. A few friends had mentioned that Fern was a great spot with vegan options. My friend is vegan and its tough to find a good place with GOOD food done right. Turns out, this was NOT one of those good places.   It has very nice yet simple decor. The mason jars chandelier was really neat. Even the silverware was cute. I like that lots of the vegetables were from local farms. We are big supporters of farm to table.  Service was good. Our server was very attentive and seem to be very knowledgeable about the menu. However, she spoke very loudly. It was a bit awkward. They were great with refilling our waters, but never asked if we wanted more sangria or another drink. Our mugs were clearly almost empty because we were eating the fruit left in the bottom, with a fork.  We decided to take our servers suggestion and went with the queens feast 4 course menu. My friend asked for the vegan options. Started with cucumber water & warm sangria which was fantastic. It actually was the best part of the meal. The rest of the meal was memorable in the worst sense possible.  First course, winter veg bruschetta top with with. She received her with cheese. So we asked for one without. The bread wasn't toasted very well, so that made it a little hard to eat. Good flavor though. Second course, I had the sweet potato and goat cheese tatin accompanied by a small arugula salad. It was eh..ok.... My friend had the blue corn fritters wit green chili sauce. The fritters was still raw in the middle and had no flavor. The sauce wasn't bad, but it would have been better if it was smooth rather than chunky. Next, I had the whole wheat pasta with house made portobella and seitan sausage with roasted brussle sprouts and topped with parmesan cheese. The pasta was very thick, tough and undercooked. The sausage was dry and flavorless. As if it had been seating under the heat lamp for too long after it was sliced. The Brussels were over cooked and mushy. The cheese was the better part of the dish. The entire dish lacked seasoning. My friend had the veg ragu; kale, mushrooms, potatoes and tempe. Again lacked flavor and was just boring.  Last course, vegan chocolate with rich chocolate sauce and a very unpleasant Orange cream filling. Apple crepes filled with what looked like house made Apple sauce, topped with few berries and whipped cream. I was looking forward to perhaps some sauteed apples or a compote of some sort. Something with texture. The Apple sauce was a terrible decision.   We are not picky eaters. We just know good food when we have it. We both believe that if the dishes were seasoned well and prepared properly, the meal would have great. We will not likely go back."}
{"text":"I wish you could provide ratings for different aspects of places because the food is amazing here but the manager is incredibly rude and uninviting. I have visited quite a few times recently, both in person and with takeout orders.  My first bad experience started when I first arrived - I approached the front door and quickly grabbed it as I saw a guy approaching who was holding a couple items and he did not look at me, thank me or even greet me. Once inside I was greeted by a nice lady who pointed us to a table outside, where we passed the guy again and again, he did not speak. Everyone who passed our table was friendly and helpful, but when we asked him for a to-go box he acted like it was a problem.  On the second occasion - one of my favorites, the Buffalo cauliflower is something I order to go often. The first couple of times I specified sauce on the side but on the 2nd and 3rd time, the guy I spoke with mentioned that they always put the sauce on the side now for to-go orders. I had dinner with a friend tonight who decided to get an additional order of the Buffalo cauliflower to-go. When it came, the side was not on the side so we asked the server and she very kindly said it wasn't a problem and would get us a new order. A few minutes later, we were approached by a guy who asked if we were waiting on an order and I explained the situation and that I was told on a couple occasions how the sauce is put on the side now for to-go orders and he proceeded to tell us he's the manager and that's not how it's done and did we ask for the sauce on the side - I said no, we did not specify this time because every other time I was assured that's the way it was done and he denied that. I told him I wasn't questioning him but that he should let his employees that they shouldn't tell customers that if it wasn't always true. He then asked what the employee looked like and I said I'm not sure (I had already mentioned my orders were over the phone) and then said we need to specify to have the sauce on the side so we won't waste the food - pause. Did he seriously just say that to a customer who is clearly a regular? He went inside and every other group of customers on the patio looked shocked and were making comments about how rude he was and how that's not the way you talk to customers. Agreed! My friend went in to address him and he blamed us for being short and denied saying that we were wasting food.  I hate to say I wouldn't go back but I have no desire to while he is still the manager - apparently his name is Adam, and I've seen a handful of reviews commenting on his demeanor so it's clear that something needs to be done. I expect much better customer service or at least a little respect."}
{"text":"Absolutely perfect except I find the prices to be a bit much.  At the end of the day I will pay the premium to put natural whole foods in my body. Top 5 options in the city for vegans!"}
{"text":"I must say the ambiance of this establishment invites you. Very unique. With that being said I have to say the food is VERY bland! If you are a lover of bold/popping flavors- this is not your place. My fiance' and I have visited Fern on several occasions. Initially, a few years ago we came for breakfast, this was when they offered the green grits (which are no longer available). We've ordered their version of \"chicken n waffles\"; bland! The mock chicken was not seasoned properly. On another occasion we brought our parents and we all ordered their version of mac n cheese, with bbq ribs, and greens- NO! Again, very bland. We've tried to give them chance after chance but we will not be dining there again. With us being vegan, when visiting from out of town we didn't have a choice but we can no longer waste our money. If you are a lover of flavor, this would not be the ideal restaurant for you."}
{"text":"This is by far the best vegetarian restaurant I've ever been to. As other reviewers have stated, even if you are not a vegetarian you will find some delicious here! Every time I stop in, I have trouble choosing what to order because everything I've tried is SO damn good. When you come you have to order the buffalo cauliflower; it's seriously what vegetarian dreams are made of! I crave this dish regularly. Also highly recommend the Brussels sprouts."}
{"text":"I first went for Sunday brunch and was really pleased with the food.  But the second time I went for dinner and it was very bland.  So, what I do like:  Not a lot of \" fake \" foods, these are meals made from fresh veggies and goodies which simply are not served with meats.  A lot of vegetarian fare is intended to be copies of meat dishes and simply meatless.  Most of the time I find these very lacking, Fern doesn't bother with those at all.  For that I am thankful."}
{"text":"Only had brunch here but I was thoroughly impressed. My girlfriend got the eggs Benedict and it was out of this world. I had the vegan chorizo scramble and it was incredible. I'd recommended it to non-vegans such as myself as well"}
{"text":"A friend took my husband and I here as we were passing through town. It was an amazing experience, I love the ambiance and decor, the menu is overwhelming there are so many options, the service was great and everything we ordered was incredible. My favorite thing was the 'fish' and chips, but everything was great. The desserts all sounded so good that we split three of them, and it was worth it. Excellent choice for vegans, vegetarians, or foodies!"}
{"text":"Can you say yum? And a healthy, fresh, aesthetic yum at that.   You walk between two heavy curtains as you enter the place. Rustic, earth based, artsy decor.  Focal points are a wall of ferns and felt, and a huge mason jar chandelier hanging from the center of the room. Kinda a hipster vibe/ crowd. Good for dates. Mostly tables for two. We were confused when we entered the room because it took awhile for anyone to greet us.  The initial host was alright, and the server was knowledgeable and aware.   When my dad walked by the kitchen, someone followed him down the hall to the bathroom, peeked in, heard him using the john, and left. Kinda odd.   Unique, quality cutlery at the tables.   We had the sticky sweet cauliflower to start. Was expecting it to be finger food, but it looked more like general Tso's. Topped with sesame seeds, which I loved. We dug in with forks and it had great flavor - not really spicy, but spiced right, and the sauce didn't overpower the cauliflower flavor. Cauliflower was perfectly (very lightly) fried.   Dad ordered the warm kale salad with beet dressing on the side. A tad salty, but still delish, as I love lightly cooked kale. I was apprehensive about the beet dressing, as beets have such a strong taste, but was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't too BEETY. He also ordered the OM burger, which he enjoyed sans pickles. Bun was too bready, but was made down the street at Duke's - local a plus.   Fingerling potatoes crisp on the outside, soft on the inside, like I like em. Just a tad salty for me.   I ordered the \"spaghetti\" (zucchini) and \"meatballs\" (white bean, eggplant, breadcrumb). Mom ordered it too, and didn't like the sauce. I thought it went well with the dish. Could taste the eggplant in the meatballs, kinda like eggplant parm.  The  zucchini peel was kind of hard. Would have been better peeled.  Overall we greatly enjoyed our meal and I will return ASAP!"}
{"text":"Fern's menu is fun and creative; drawing on seasonal and local flavors to create an appeal for all palates. Even the most zealous meat-eater is sure to find a hearty and satisfying meal.   The decor is earthy, verdant, rustic...it has all the right elements for comfort. Our server was attentive and friendly.   Our group tried: spiked apple cider, Duck-Rabbit Craft beer, the local cheese plate trio, jalapeno hush puppies,  warm kale salad, the soup of the day, the pot pie, the veggie Buddha bowl, and the beer chocolate donuts for dessert.  As a  vegetarian, I gotta give it 5 stars. Really looking forward to going back!   Hint: Half price bottles of wine every Thursday."}
{"text":"My husband and I just had lunch at Fern.  Customer service is great.  The decor is very well done, comfy and rustic.  The pittata brava had great flavor and spice.  The side of sweet potatoes is a great alternative to the normal french fries.  If we weren't from out of town we would be regulars!"}
{"text":"The served us cucumber water when we were seated, and I ordered black coffee and a bloody mary. I had to - bloody mary's were $1! :) I loved the mason jars.  I had the Quinoa & Spinach Benedict (with vegan hollandaise sauce so I could eat it! dairy-free for the win) and a gluten-free biscuit. I ordered 4 GF biscuits to go they were so good - denser than typical biscuits but still tasty.   The food was delicious - even non-vegetarians would like this place! They had a cozy little covered patio too."}
{"text":"Came to Fern for the first time and was very pleased.   Plenty of options for Vegans at this Vegetarian spot.   Prices were excellent for these presentations from classically trained chefs.   Highly recommended and a new favorite!"}
{"text":"Came to pre-celebrate my vegan daughters birthday.    We all came away happy and satisfied.  I had the Laughing Buddha Bowl,  my son had flatbread and my daughter had bbq tempeh.  All good choices."}
{"text":"\"Meh\" is the best word to describe this restaurant. Having a good experience there is extremely hit or miss. I've been often enough because it's within walking distance of my house, but I'm sick of giving them my money. Service is slow, even when the place is empty, and most of the meals suffer from a lack of proper seasoning. This is a shame, because they do use quality ingredients, and the location/ambiance of the place is nice. The kale salad is *decent*, as is the veggie burger. Everything else I've ever ordered has been bland, uninspired, and not worth the money. A friend and I ate there today. I realized halfway through the meal that the kitchen staff forgot to put the cashews in my salad that are listed on the menu. The place was nearly empty and our server didn't bother to check on us after serving our meals until we were nearly finished eating. At that point, it wasn't worth my time/energy to complain so we paid and left. My friend and I both agreed that it'd be a waste of appetite and money to return. Good riddance. I'd like to see another veg place move into Plaza-Midwood and give these guys some competition. They need it."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved the food here. I'm a carnivore and we come here just to try something new. I had the steak and cheese sandwich and the taste was not sacrificed on the meal being vegetarian. I will definitely come here again. The service was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Fern is a Gluten Free or Vegans dream! Amazing food and great service. I can't highly recommend this enough. Encourage all to check out this local treat. Try the GF biscuit and you won't be disappointed. Also brunch specials!"}
{"text":"Great service, fun assortment of dishes. Loved the kimchee and pecan pate. Generous servings. Good assortment of local beers.  The tempeh schnitzel was a fun riff on the meat version: I am tempted to try to make it at home!  It was gratifying to  find a vegetarian restaurant using strong technique."}
{"text":"A happy accident: We discovered this place by accident and glad we did. Had brunch on a Saturday and completely loved it. I'm not a vegetarian and enjoyed it. Muffins and jam were delightful. Drinks were excellent and most of all the food was yummy. Leftovers the next day made we want to return soon."}
{"text":"Love Fern! Have a great selection of my vegan items that changes seasonally. Started with bbq cauliflower that has a sweet, almost tangy flavor. Etoufee was a great choice to follow. Great local beer selection to choose from. Even better on Sundays with their homeade bloody Mary mix they feature.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I decided to give Fern a second chance today and I must say - I'm glad I did.  Compared to the Mushroom Risotto nightmare, the Om Burger is a heavenly delight.  The texture of the lightly fried patty is reminiscent of a perfect piece of falafel with a thin layer of crispiness adding a unique twist to the usual veggie burger fare.  The spices are perfect, with a unique blend of peppers and hickory, giving it a light BBQ flavor.  The roasted potatoes are also perfectly seasoned.    If this is what everyone is raving about, then I can certainly understand.  I will give Fern a third chance sometime to see if they deserve a higher rating, but for now I'd say they have redeemed themselves from a one star."}
{"text":"I am large white male who loves his meat. That being said, this place rox! I LOVED the food. I had the goat cheese veggie burger and it was amazing. Our waitress was so friendly and helpful. Plus the mulled wine/ sangria was very good as well.  5 stars, I will be back."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Fern!  The food is always flavorful and fresh.  I especially enjoy Sunday brunch (and not just for the $1 vegan Bloody Mary's).  Non-veg friends enjoy going with me too!"}
{"text":"Fern is the kind of restaurant, where after finishing your meal, will say \"that was great\"-- but may not necessarily crave an item enough to put the restaurant on regular lunch/dinner rotation.  I've been here a few times, and each time, service was good, and the ambiance is nice with super rustic slab wood tables, custom-made fern-filled felt wall art, and artichoke salt and pepper shakers.   For appetizers, the squash blossoms *are* as good as everyone says.  Creamy insides, crisp outsides. Very flavorful, despite the perception vegan cheese is bland.  But since they're out of season, they'll have an alternative appetizer.  Today it was potato croquettes (sweet potato and purple potato) dipped in pesto.  These were nice, though something slightly amiss.  Perhaps, too creamy inside? Nonetheless they were piping hot and fresh from the fryer.   We also had the soup starter featuring yellow peas (I believe...) and butternut squash.  Nice, not overly salty, had sweet flavor from onions and squash.  Only served with a piece of toasted bread the size of a postage stamp.  Because the soup isn't a hearty, creamy soup, it would have been nice to have a larger piece of crusty bread to dip.   This Indian fry bread appetizer is of the Native American kind of fry bread, not Indian from India.  Topped with a bean chili-type mixture, tomato and cheese, it's like an all-natural puffy taco.  My only criticism, which was shared by another woman I sat across the room from, the fry bread is a bit tough.  It's hard to cut and very chewy. Flavors are good.   The popular Om Burger was indeed good. It was mostly because the bun was nicely toasted, the burger itself was meaty in texture, and the goat cheese a nice add-on.  Quinoa salad is a nice accompanying side.  I still like the veggie burger over at 131 Main better (I've had it about 6 times...beet and brown rice based with teriyaki glaze and havarti cheese.)  The Buddah Bowl changes, and I've had it two different times.  Both times, the veggie selection is nice, the vegan sauce/veggie sauce to accompany is good too, but could use a kick.  I mean, like Nicole W. mentioned, it needs spice of some kind.  Pot Pie: Mushroom cream sauce and large chunks of summer squash, a few pieces of carrot, and chickpeas.  I really liked the flavor of this dish hot. Thick, creamy, and again, super hot. But the veggies really varied in doneness.  The carrots were kind of hard...some yellow squash was medium hard...some zucchini was well cooked, as were the mushrooms.  When I think pot pie, I also would like a real puff pastry or any kind of \"top\".  Instead, it comes with a croissant.  Not the buttery, flaky make-a-mess-on-your-lap kind, but a hybrid 30% real croissant, and 70% Pilsbury Crescent Roll.  It's more bread than a croissant.  (Look at how in-depth I'm going into the scientifics of this carbohydrate product.) It was good at sopping up the sauce, and got the job done.  Just not what I expected.   I also wondered why the vegetables in the pot pie weren't in season, and why they were so  ununiform in size. I had giant chunks of carrots...but small chickpeas, slivers of SUMMER squash.    I think that does it for now.  Overall, it was good.  I felt good after I ate here, and would take my friends, veggie or not.  I did head a couple diners complain to their server about waiting 40 minutes for their main entrees to arrive...and I did overhead some other diners being just so-so satisfied with their meals.  If Fern amped up the flavor just a bit, and made some minor improvements, this restaurant would be a knock out."}
{"text":"The black bean burger is to die for!!!! at last, a vegetarian restaurant that has a great atmosphere, delicious food and great staff."}
{"text":"This place is truly magical. Everything on the menu looked amazing- all vegetarian, with several vegan and gluten-free options. The market street corn appetizer was a piece of art and delicious. Kale chip side was perfectly cooked and a very nice size. The ginger tofu and smashed potatoes \"fish and chips\" is a fun vegan spin on a classic, and the Squash Fillet is in a sauce that you'll remember forever. GREAT service. Adorable atmosphere with mason jar chandeliers and two live herb walls. I wish I lived here so we could go all the time!"}
{"text":"I'm vegetarian and I felt lucky when I found Fern. However, i'm saying goodbye. My first 3 experiences were not the best and it is just customer service. I witnessed someone denied service in a rude way because they walked through the door 10 minutes before closing. I was given the check with no option to order dessert because they had just closed. Every single time and with different waiters they are just pushy and annoying on wanting to take your order and have you out if there fast. I found out by chance that they were taking orders for Thanksgiving meal on the last day as advertised on their website. I called and they said we are no longer taking orders and once I pointed out that according to their website that day was still within the range they said no in an annoyed snd non apologetic way. Still I'm masochist enough to take my sister and her husband visiting out if town because I always raved to them about the food to only witness what I feel is just outrageous. You must provide a credit card over the phone to get a reservation. I'm sorry your food is good but I'm not putting up with your entitlement power."}
{"text":"NOT GLUTEN FREE DO NOT EAT IF YOU HAVE AN ALLERGY! This restaurant claims on their menu that certain items are gluten free, but during my visit there the chef AND manager both admitted they are in fact not. They almost put my friend in a hospital.  Also, it is insulting how much they charge for food I could give my pet rabbits."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian with vegan tendencies, I was so excited to try Fern during a trip to Charlotte. The menu is very appealing, but the food is only so-so. Huge portions, but almost everything seemed fried and then smothered in salt and vinegar. (I love frying and salt and vinegar, but a little variety would have been great.) The best things were the appetizers, especially baba ghanouj and caramelized cauliflower glazed with (what else?) tons of salt and balsamic vinegar. Nice staff, attractive restaurant, easy parking. If they thought a little more creatively about the food preparation, this place could be terrific. I'd love to give it another chance the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  Plaza Midwood is becoming the hot spot for Charlotte foodies.  I am not vegetarian but quality of the food was second to none.      Set in a cozy Garden-House type atmosphere this place will change the way most people look at vegetarian food.  We loved the Mason jar lighting and the herbs and ferns growing from the wall.     We were there very late, I think we walked in at 10pm, and they were gracious enough to let us eat.  We had the OM burger and the veggie filled Chicken and Dumplings.  The burger was incredible and the Dumplings were very good.    This place is has joined the list my favorite restaurants in Charlotte."}
{"text":"This place was great! One of the best options for vegans that I've found in the entire south. I really liked the decor ('re-purposed items) and the staff was efficient and polite. The food was very clean with great flavors. Everything was nice!   Wish it were all-vegan... but this place is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Amazing! they really know how to cook tofu! the food is very flavorful and the restaurant decor is cool, fern  on a wall piece!"}
{"text":"I may need to give this restaurant another try!  Shortly after it opened, a young vegetarian friend decided we would eat there.  We arrived some time in the late afternoon.  The door was open, and a tv was on, as if the place was open.  But NO ONE was there!  We walked in and after a few minutes we realized that the place  seemed to be empty!  I became concerned about this because of the door being open, television on,etc.  I was worried that maybe there had been a robbery or that someone was ill or injured.  I actually walked into the back of the restaurant looking for signs of life and calling out.  The place  REALLY was  EMPTY!  I was still concerned because there were computers and potentially other things that could be stolen!  We hung around for a while just to see if anyone would return, and no one did.  Eventually we went into the business next door(some kind of gardening center) and made them aware that this restaurant was\" wide open and empty\" .  They seemed duly unimpressed , and I'm assuming it never got robbed because I didn't hear anything on the news.  I guess I should have notified the police when I found it unattended and empty.    Anyway, I never went back so consequently never tried their food!  I live in that general area, and I think I will make another attempt to eat there.  I hope they are now more safety conscious!"}
{"text":"A wonderful experience from start to finish. I started with an amaretto sour which was gorgeous. I had the eggplant veggie balls over zuchinni spaghetti seasoned to perfection, and my guest had the shepherd's pie. The ambiance was great, the server helpful and knowledgeable and the overall experience was five stars."}
{"text":"Bland food but worse than that was the poor attitude and uncaring staff.  After taking a cab from the Ritz-Carlton to Fern just to try their food  -- what we received was food that was very bland in taste and heavy on salt.  Myself and my wife ate less than 10% of our meals and the waitress never asked to see how we liked our food.  The manager finally came to ask how we were doing.  After explaining the situation she never even attempted to correct the situation or offer reparations.  I highly recommend avoiding this place especially if you are in the uptown area as there are so many good restaurants with excellent staff in this area.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I was excited to try out Fern.  You walk straight into the dining room from the parking lot through a curtain. The restaurant itself was small and cozy.  Overall, I was a bit underwhelmed with the food.  It was very hit or miss.    We started with the Brussels Sprout appetizer.  The Brussels sprouts were excellent...nice char with a subtle balsamic glaze.    I had the OM burger.  It was decent...nice seasoning but nothing special.  My friend had the black bean burger.   He hated it...very mushy and hardly cooked.  He got the country fried tempeh as a replacement...but he said it was just OK.  The sides were hit or miss.  The quinoa salad was bland.  On the bright side, the fingerling roasted potatoes were outstanding!  Perfectly cooked and seasoned.    For desert we had the beignet s'mores.  Definitely one of the worst deserts I have ever had.  The beignets were doughy, chewy and flavorless.  There was a garnish of tasteless marshmallow and graham cracker.  Avoid at all costs!  Yuk!"}
{"text":"Great girls dinner! I would not bring my husband, there is no meat whatsoever on the menu. The menu is updated seasonally, lots of options. Small but manageable wine list. The food was delicious. I had the kale salad and the Om burger. The OM burger was just a little dry but the salad was awesome and super filling! We splurged on dessert and so glad we did - wow, the gingerbread cake was to die for. Hope to be back soon!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had heard really good things about this place, so we decided to try it the other night.  (Neither of us are vegan or even vegetarians).  When you first walk in, you immediately spot the mason jar chandelier, and the atmosphere just kind of grabs you....very inviting feel.  We started with the bruschetta, which was pretty good.  I would have like for the bread to be a bit crunchier, but the flavors of the topping were excellent.  My wife ordered the Indian Tacos and said that she really like them and would definitely get them again.  I ordered the Buddha Bowl, which is a conglomeration of the day's fresh vegetables tossed together in a great sauce and spooned over rice and beans.  Very good and hearty dish.  I actually expected to leave this place still hungry, but was totally surprised by the heartiness of the dishes.  Can't wait to go back!  Oh and they also have a great selection of organic wines too!"}
{"text":"I tried the OM burger and loved it, and that is saying something because I am picky when it comes to my veggie burgers!  The kale chips are AMAZING, and I am not usually a huge fan of those either!  I was very impressed, and can't wait to try more from here!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Went to Fern for dinner and absolutely loved it.  The food was phenomenal.  Bruschetta with heirloom tomato, Indian tacos and a filling fennel soup made for an amazing meal.  They had a nice selection of juice concoctions - refreshing and healthy!  I enjoyed the unique menu selection, every plate was delicious.  If I could eat here everyday I would have no problem going Veg.  The service was very friendly while the dining area, though small, is nice and has an outdoor patio feel.  Thursday night is half off wine night!"}
{"text":"Best Vegan/vegetarian restaurant in Charlotte!!! The staff was really friendly and the food was amazing! Heads up, the place is really small yet very quaint. It's recommended to make reservations ahead of time. Will be coming back here very often!!"}
{"text":"Love this place ! I really enjoy the food and service, plus the Carrot Cake was amazing!"}
{"text":"Friendly and prompt service, fair prices, delicious food! Everything we ordered was great. Nice calm vibes inside. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"It's finally here - my long-awaited 100th review goes to Fern!   Kenzie K. knows that I'm a raging veggie lover, so she suggested we try out Fern when I came to NC. The only thing I can say about Fern is that it was a cleansing experience (especially after stuffing our faces with greasier foods at Food Truck Friday the day before). From the Strawberry Lemonade Juice (strawberry, basil, agave, lemon, cayenne) to the Om burger (yep...just as good as everyone says) to the Cauliflower Poutine (NEVER able to pass up Poutine in any form), it all left me feeling really clean and light. Honorable mentions go to the Ramen as well - I'm always on the hunt for the next great ramen, and I enjoyed this veggie take on it!   If only we hadn't been so full, I would have loved to check out their dessert menu and/or another juice. See you when I'm back in NC, Fern!"}
{"text":"Great ambience, beer, and wine.  Veggie burger was tasty though a bit overwhelmed with bread.  Egg nog ice cream with apple upside down cake was delicious.  Definitely worth checking out.  Wish I would have tried Indian tacos."}
{"text":"I definitely miss living near Fern since moving from Charlotte. It's super yummy and has a great atmosphere. To be honest, the only downfall is that it's a little pricey but it's worth it. The buffalo cauliflower is hands down the best thing on the menu and it's a crowd favorite even for meat eaters. The service has always been great and I somehow have always gone just before it gets busy so I've never had to wait for a table."}
{"text":"Great fusion of vegetarian vegan dishes. Friesgbjk sraff. Drinks were good also basil jalapeño margarita"}
{"text":"I almost finger licked the bottom of the pan, however, I saved my dignity by using the last veggie morsel that remained instead. That's a win.  Buffalo Cauliflower-yuuummmm..mum..mum..mum..muuuummm!! I wasn't expecting the flavor action. This dish was seasoned very well, had a little kick of heat, and the vinegar in the hot sauce balanced it all out. They sprinkled the top with diced carrots and celery. How clever. :)  Tuna Melt-my mind totally believed that this was tuna fish. It was super flavorful, smooth yet textured, and the rye bread was a nice addition.  The customer service was great as well."}
{"text":"I finally ate here. It was a beautiful day and we decided to eat outside. I opted for the taco pizza, with potato salad on the side. It was so damn good. They start you off cucumber water, which was so refreshing.  The pizza was flavorful and filling.  The right amount of spiciness. The waitress was on it. Service was amazing. I parked across the street where Five Guys and Home Healthy Market because parking is tight. I would suggest this place."}
{"text":"I love the concept, but I was expecting more from the seitan chicken.  It looked more like a cheap so burger.  Although thankfully it wasn't soggy like most veggie burgers."}
{"text":"I've had lunch here twice now and wow, both times amazing.  So glad there is a veggie only option on East Blvd. now!  Can't wait to go back next week!"}
{"text":"Amazing.  Probably the best vegetarian food I've had in Charlotte.  My wife had the sweet potato gnocchi and I had the fry bread tacos.  Both were delicious, as was our starter - squash blossom hush puppies.  The beer donut desert was fine, but not quite as great as everything else.  We certainly will be going back."}
{"text":"Fern is high-end vegetarian dining (yes, in Charlotte!) that even non-vegetarians enjoy. It's the place where you take your omnivore friends who are willing to try vegetarian food but aren't crossing over anytime soon. The food is delicious, flavorful, and innovative."}
{"text":"I had a little trouble with the website but when I called the guy who answered was extremely helpful. Menu is hard to find on the website (it's above the brunch menu) but once you find it go get the Om burger. So delicious! I got it with the kale chips and it was a good decision. I can't wait to try more from Fern. Next time I will go and sit down because the atmosphere is awesome."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place as it's right in my hood and serves up some healthy options. After numerous friends recommended we give it a shot, my wife and I decided to check it out for brunch. We sat outside and enjoyed both the vibe, the service, the cocktails, the muffins and fresh jam (the highlight sadly).  Unfortunately the main dishes were a huge disappointment. We shared chicken (tofu) and waffles and huevos rancheros and both missed the mark. We had heard chicken and waffles were a must try and it had great potential, but was ruined with a waffle that required a chainsaw to cut that tasted like cardboard (it was made with spelt). The tofu was somewhat interesting, though not very fried chicken like IMO, but without a solid waffle this dish was a fail. The huevos rancheros was boring, even with the added vegan cheese, and I doubt we will ever return."}
{"text":"Great vibe! Great food! We will visit again, especially for that buffalo cauliflower!"}
{"text":"First visit last week and had the Tempeh Rueben...OMG it was amazing!!  So many things on the menu I want to try.  Going back this week and probably the next week too.  Friendly staff and creative menu items.  Highly recommended.!"}
{"text":"I love going to Fern! Their restaurant decor is very unique, and the food is amazing. It's nice to be able to eat out at a restaurant where you know that a lot (if not most) of their food is locally grown, organic and just plain delicious!! Staff is friendly and enthusiastic about what they have to offer. If you can, make a reservation...the place is fairly small and fills up quickly.  The cucumber-infused water is one of my favorites!!"}
{"text":"The food was very delicious. However, my guests and i felt unwelcome as the manager never spoke to us or our table, even though he came three times to drop off different items, never smiled, was not friendly, but we see him talking and friendly to other tables, we dont know if it was our race or sexuality or just his own bad attitude towards us but we felt very unwanted in this establishment. Manager on duty is Adam, the waitress let us know. Wont return"}
{"text":"We came to Charlotte mostly to eat at this restaurant, which we did for dinner and brunch. Dinner has a bunch of healthy, lower-carb vegan options (plus less-healthy desserts, but I do not regret the ice cream sandwich!). Brunch consists more of hearty Southern options but was very good. Highly recommend the cinnamon rolls as an app! Good service and the patio is dog-friendly."}
{"text":"A table outside on a sunny, 65 degree January day- sure I'll sit there. A table that seats five and I dine alone on this afternoon, I feel guilty (for a moment).   Start off with a glass of cucumber water- that did not ever go empty! Amazing considering my thirst. The place was pretty empty but the wait staff was extremely on the ball and fast-talking ...listen closely to the menu changes and specials :) Don't worry, they'll repeat for you slow listeners. I was disappointed when I heard the famous squash blossoms weren't available (\"out of season\" ??). The substitute was a purple sweet potato croquette, although I did not try.   After browsing the menu and a few questions for Rach, I went with the OM  burger with goat cheese with quinoa salad. After a few more gulps of cucumber water, my burger arrives on a nice crusty bun. I really! enjoyed this burger, the goat cheese sets it off against that jalapeno mayo. Great recommendation.  The staff and clientele here are super friendly and cool- a group of three joined me mid-bite (I offered *wave over*) after one of them expressed their disappointment with no outside seating available. I'll be back to try the squash blossoms and indian tacos."}
{"text":"Fern is so cute! I wasn't sure how much vegan food I'd find in Charlotte but this place is great. They have a wonderfully dynamic menu, with some classics and some more original dishes. We had the black bean hummus to start, which was yummy. I had the tofu/squash bowl and my boyfriend had the coconut peanut dish. His food definitely won - the tofu was just delicious. The decor is cute and the waiters are very nice. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat vegetarian food but I wish it were a little more special and unique. I like the interesting menu, but the food isn't high quality. I've had undercooked veggies and bland, wilting bok choy. I keep wanting to give Fern another try, but I always don't have high expectations for this place."}
{"text":"OH VEGETARIANS GATHER!  VEGANS LINK HANDS!  Let's sing and dance around Fern!  Hey you meaty folks will dig this too.  Here is how it all went own.  Husband- rocked the budda bowl Me- Ragout  Ap- Squash blossom goodness  It was fresh, perfectly prepared, and it was my birthday dinner out, and a total DEE_light (groove is in the heaaaarttttt!)"}
{"text":"I love Fern. The food is innovative, unique, delicious, and filling... a combination that is hard to come by in many vegetarian restaurants.   I love that they use local ingredients as much as possible, and the menu changes with the seasons. The Indian Tacos and Beet Tagliatelle are a hands down favorite, and hubby enjoys the Om burger, which is massive! The Buddha Bowl is another go to dish that never fails to impress.   The decor is just plain fun. It is also a great spot to drop in and order a juice from, especially with the lack of raw juice bars in Charlotte.   Despite the absence of a kid's menu, the staff has always been wonderful and kind when we bring our 4 year old daughter along. The soups are delicious, and make the perfect serving size for her dinner.  We have yet to try any of Fern's desserts, but if positive exclamations from nearby tables are any indication, they are delicious indeed. :-)  We have also brought both sets of our parents to eat at Fern. Both my family and his are meat-lovers, and they were pleasantly surprised at how much they enjoyed the vegetarian fare, with compliments rather than complaints."}
{"text":"Tried a few different options here om burger was the best. Cozy place. Nice light fixtures. It's more upscale than I would've thought. Ill be back."}
{"text":"Disappointing! As a vegetarian, I had high hopes for Fern, but the food was flavorless and executed poorly. The atmosphere is cozy, small and quaint with soft, mason jar chandelier lighting. The service was good. But I can't get over how bad the food was.   The CAULIFLOWER POUTINE was a good idea, but the potato mixed with the cauliflower had been whipped to the point of having a glue-y texture. The kind of texture that makes your tongue stick to the top of your mouth while you're trying to chew. The cheese curd tasted like mozzarella, which was fine, but nothing special. The tomato gravy was fine, and the little pile of greens on top were the only interesting flavor in the dish (very strong and herb-y). We were planning to order a few more appetizers, but after the Poutine showing, we ditched that idea.   The OM BURGER was inedible. The bun was dry and hard, and the burger patty was dense and hard and flavorless. The condiments couldn't save this burger.   The 200 YEAR OLD SOURDOUGH FLATBREAD title created a hype that the thick, hard, stale, non-sour flatbread did not live up to. I took 3 bites, which was 2 too many. On the plus side, the topping - chorizo, verde sauce, red onions and cotija cheese - was flavorful and delicious. Unfortunately, I'm not interested in scraping and only eating the top of my pizza.   The sides were also a disappointment. The QUINOA of the day was described as red quinoa, mango, mint, red onion, and some other delicious sounding ingredients. It was fresh and cold, but not at all delicious. After coating with salt, a few bites were edible, but really still no flavor at all.   The SMASHED CRISPY FINGERLING POTATOES had potential, but only 3 of 12 potatoes were actually smashed and crispy. The other 9 were whole boring fingerling potatoes with no flavor or crunch. After mixing the flatbread topping with some of the potatoes, I was able to eat a few bites.   The waitress seemed surprised that we didn't want to take to-go the 75% of our dishes that we didn't eat. No, thanks. We're heading to Taco Bell for a little flavor."}
{"text":"I'm not vegan, or even vegetarian, but I appreciate the gastric desires of all mankind, particularly when it is presented as pleasingly as Fern, Charlotte's newest (and best) vegetarian eatery.  I've recently begun admiring the Something Classic team (the folks behind Halcyon and Something Classic Cafe), but Fern takes it to a new level. Where Halcyon is refined and a bit over-priced, Fern is comfortable, delicious and reasonably priced. I'm not usually one for giving star-breakdowns, but I will since we largely dined on small plates:  Wine (4.5 out of 5) -- Our table of four ordered a bottle of Spanish red, a mixing grape I asked our server to repeat twice and still don't remember the name. (When their website is up, I'll come back and update the review). It was a fiery, delicious red - complex and spicy, which is exactly our taste. And at $30, super well priced.  Three Cheese Plate (5 out of 5) -- Loved it! A smoked goat cheese, brie and cheddar, all local/regionally produced, and served with flatbread crisps that remind me of flats I ate as a child - a perfect accompaniment for the cheese. And that cheddar!? It was really good. I need to learn more about where it came from.  Bruschetta (4.5 out of 5) -- We took David A.'s advice below and gave the bruschetta a try. Out. Of. This. World. I mean, this isn't bruschetta as you've likely ever had it at an Italian restaurant, but it was fresh, chock full of vegetables (heirloom tomato?) and so delicious. I'd have given this 5 stars, but it was maybe one piece too small for our table - we divided two large pieces between the four of us. Really, we should have just gotten two orders - it was that good.  Squash Blossom Hushpuppies (4 out of 5) -- Yum! Really delicious little fried pockets with a butter than definitely worked. Again, because we were sharing across a table of four, I just pined for an extra piece or two so I wouldn't seem so piggish. You get three, and I would have loved 4 or 5.  Indian Tacos (3.5 out of 5) -- I agree with Nicole W. below - these are filling, but they were my least favorite component of the night, though still worthy of 3.5 stars. Spicy and earthy, these tacos are well described - classically Indian flavors and textures. I don't know what I expected - maybe a little lighter or lettuce/tomato based? In any case, my plate was clean when the meal was done, so there ya go.  Service (5 out of 5) -- Our server Susan was great, personable and attentive. She clearly knew her stuff and by the second bottle of wine (yes, we had two) our group was getting a little spirited, and she was great to us. I really appreciate excellent service, and that's what we got. If the food alone wasn't worth the return trip (and it was, believe me), personable staff like her would encourage us to give it another go.   Fern is a welcomed addition to Charlotte's eatery landscape. Don't think vegetarian is your thing? Give it a try anyway - you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! I went in for lunch on a Saturday afternoon and all the staff were so friendly. I ate at the counter and ordered the cauliflower buffalo wings and the small cheese plate. The ambience was friendly and the food came quickly. The cauliflower buffalo wings were the best that I have ever had in my life - topped with cut up carrots and celery, such a nice touch! The cheese plate was heavenly, and all three cheeses were dairy free which surprised me - I haven't had great experiences with vegan cheeses but these were all such a pleasant surprise, my favorite of these was the pimento cheese. It was definitely a lot of food for one person so I brought home about half of the cauliflower buffalo wings and ate them later! I would definitely go back to Fern because I want to try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"Buffalo Cauliflower, Chimichanga, Carrot Cake and staff - all amazing!!!! The tuna melt left a little to be desired but it wasn't bad. Quinoa salad - delicious. The place wasn't as crowded as I expected for noon on a Friday but I guess that worked out to our advantage. Will definitely try brunch."}
{"text":"Amazing zucchini \"noodle\" soup. Friendly, low-key. The soup was delicious, and especially was healthy in addition - a hard combo to come by. The \"noodles\" were zucchini sliced into long strips like noodles, then it had delicious vegetables and was topped with amazing coconut milk foam. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I ate here last night with my husband. A little over priced, but it's worth it to be in a vegan restaurant. We ordered the buffalo cauliflower- holy moly it's amazing. I couldn't stop eating it. Keep in mind the cauli is fried and they murder it with salt, but it's delicious. I ordered the squash filets- little disappointed. 5 slices of baked squash over pureed avocado for $17... I wouldn't order it again, it was flavorless. My husband got the chimichanga, and cleared his plate. Other than the airport price points, we liked this place, and will eventually come back."}
{"text":"I've had this place bookmarked for a while now and finally made it over this weekend with my husband and son. We arrived extremely late after a long Saturday of running errands and hanging out family style. Fern closes at 9pm and we arrived around 8:30pm, we walked up to a open lit patio with people eating and we entered Fern and was greeted and asked if we wanted to dine on the patio or inside. The night air had started to have a nip to it so I opted for inside. We had a window table to the left of the entrance and our service came over immediately after we sat and had a little while to review the menu.  He asked if we wanted anything to drink besides water which we declined. I went on to ask him the best items on the menu. He ask was I Vegan and I replied YES and my husband wasn't Vegan. He suggested the Chimichunga for me as a Vegan favorite and my husband the Chicken Bacon (coconut bacon) ranch burger as a non vegan favorite. We both got the fingerling potatoes as a side to share with our toddler as he ate off both of our plates as they didn't have a kids menu which is sucky and one of the two reasons they didn't get a 5 star rating. The other reason is the fact that there are no changing tables. I'm BIG on places having a changing table as families spend lots of time out and a changing table is key when out as it's already difficult enough to change a child so without a changing table it's worst and more acrobatics involved to accomplish. I'll definitely be back as my food was amazing."}
{"text":"After driving past (because of no outdoor signage that's lit), we finally arrived at Fern around 8:30 on Saturday night.  We made our grand entrance through some curtains, stepping right into the dining room and angering the customers nearby who received the cold gust of wind that followed us in.  (They really need a waiting area/host stand and something more than curtains to block the outside from coming inside.)    We were asked if we had a reservation.  We didn't really think we needed one since it was getting pretty late in the evening for dinner, but apparently it's a very good idea.  Who knew it would be so crowded?  So we made a reservation at that point with the owner and we said we'd come back around 9.  We walked a little ways up the street for a drink at Midwood Smokehouse while we waited.    We came back around 9, angering customers near the doorway again.  We were taken to a room outside of the dining room which appeared to be the waiting room for Something Classic Catering with a view of the kitchen.  There were a couple of makeshift tables set up in this room for dining guests which seemed a bit tacky because you were basically seated in a hallway.  I would not have been pleased to have been seated there if I were them.    We were brought water (cucumber water?) by one of the servers while we waited, which was really nice.  Then that same server asked if we wanted to try their warm sangria while we waited.  We figured they were being extra accommodating to us since we were being asked to wait for a table even longer.  The server brought out these huge mugs with warm sangria which was kind of like a hot mulled cider.  It tasted pretty good, but wasn't something I would normally order.    After we were brought to our table, we were given two copies of their extended past-the-date Queen's Feast menu and only one copy of their regular menu.  Our server politely informed us that they were out of the panini sandwich.  We didn't really want the 3-course meal (actually 4-course here) options, so we had to pass the one regular menu back and forth to share.  We decided we'd share an app and then both get bowls of soup and the only other entree on the menu besides the panini, the veggie burger.    We ordered and then were informed by the server that they just ran out of the veggie burgers, too.  Huh.  So both entree options were gone, leaving us with just soup, apps, and salad.  I found this very ironic at a vegetarian restaurant.  I'm forever reading complaints from vegetarians that restaurants don't have enough veggie options besides salads and here at a vegetarian restaurant, I see the same thing.    We ordered the Indian tacos as an app, bowls of the squash soup, and two salads.   At first I thought the Indian tacos would have a curry flavor, but upon closer inspection of the menu before we ordered, I was excited to see that they were actually Native American tacos, made from fry bread, a delicacy we had recently discovered out in Phoenix.  And they were really delicious!  I'd definitely recommend them to anyone, especially if they've never tried fry bread.    The squash soup was delicious, too.  It was very flavorful and came with some tasty toasted pumpkin seeds on top.    Last was our salad (our substitute entree).  It looked like Bibb lettuce with feta cheese, cold cubed roasted squash, and more pumpkin seeds.   It was delicious, but was pretty small for the $12 price tag.  Luckily, we were pretty full already from the tacos and soup.    While we ate, I watched the people at certain tables every time the door opened and they were blasted with the gust of cold air.  They were not having a good time, and I was glad we weren't seated at one of those tables (or the ones out in the hallway!).    Our server delivered our bill and we were a little (but not too) surprised to find the warm sangria on there at $8 a cup.  We thought it was being given to us a nice, warm gesture, but apparently it was just a sneaky way to upcharge the bill.  (Be forewarned!)  That's when I sucked down the rest of it to get our money's worth.  I think Fern is still going through its growing pains and we hope they make some changes that would really make a fantastic restaurant option, including redefining their dining room spacing and breezeway issue, offering more vegetarian options other than salad and/or not running out of both entree choices (!), and not offering an $8 drink as a \"sample\" and then charging for it.    The food options we did experience were delicious, though."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: Beautiful outdoor scenery! Great patio seating, lights above the patio, all in a nice quiet location. There is a parking lot for all you drivers! This is a great place for catching up with a friend, having brunch with the ladies, or even celebrating a special occasion!   FOOD: This is a vegan restaurant, however some of the things they have may have artificial flavoring (i.e. almond milk). I had ordered the pesto panini with tomato soup bisque, which was all good, however the panini was a bit greasy. For some particular reason, the coffees that we were served was never hot, it was always just mildly warm which was very irritating. All in all this place is beautiful with the exception of the food, which could have tasted a bit better being from 'flavors from the garden'."}
{"text":"Our favorite spot in Charlotte! We drive from Raleigh for the amazing Sunday brunch! The muffin basket is delicious and the chickpea quinoa cakes are AMAZING! Best vegan pancakes!! As a vegan, I love they have Earth Balance & such delicious vegan options!!"}
{"text":"Loveeee this place! Had the Buddha bowl, black bean hummus, buffalo cauliflower, and a heavenly piece of carrot cake... and tasted a friend's bread pudding... ALL AMAZING! Outdoor space is lovely, and staff were very friendly. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"I would like to give it more stars but I was simply aggravated by the service here that I really don't see myself going back! My sister and I went in a couple of Saturdays ago for lunch and we were seated away from the door they had maybe 6 tables in there so not crazy. We were approached by a server and she got us water, then another server came over to ask if we've heard the specials, then another server came over to see if we had any questions, and then finally another server came over to see if we were ready, all in the meantime i never got my iced tea i ordered but the table next to me did and they ordered it after me. Then i asked for sweetener and that finally came after i asked again for it. WHO IS MY SERVER!!!   I was sooo annoyed at this point so we go to order a few of things that everyone has been yelping about- Squash Blossoms and the Bruscetta the server says oh were out of the squash blossoms-um hi we've had 10 servers and not one of you could tell us the things you were out of....then i order my gnocchi-were out of that too, no apology but yet the server staring at me like what else do you want.   We started off with the Artichoke- lacked so much flavor but we couldn't figure out how because the garlic sauce it was sitting in was good. Then we had the Asparagus Bruscetta- very good and so nice and fresh. We both ended up with the Vegetable Pannini it was ok lacked flavor again and too much bread. So we finish our lunch and i notice the manager fighting with the servers to start cleaning up the dining room and getting it reset- I honestly could not believe this women was serious like take it to the kitchen not in the middle of your dining room!! so unprofessional so its almost like you cant blame the servers because they are being lead by this woman!!   One last thing- this is not the Penguin/Diamond you really cant do the tag team service in a place like this because of your prices and at least at the Diamond they're good servers and aren't so intrusive!! I live in the neighborhood and I cant say that I want to return or recommend anyone to try it. Good concept could be better once you work out the front of the house situation and you will be ten times better!!"}
{"text":"I was a little thrown off initially by the guy (manager) greeting us from across the room, sipping water, and informing us to sit at one of the small tables since there were only two of us.. yikes. Definitely not what i expected. Otherwise, he was friendly throughout dining experience.   I selected this location bc my friend is vegetarian and we were out celebrating her bday. Food was ok. Im not a vegetarian or vegan, so im likely biased. Food tasted bland probably because we ordered items with sauce, for sauce to be on side. I was happy they offered non vegan dairy options.   For price point, left dissatisfied and hungry, lol. $40, with tip, for lunch :-(   Nice atmosphere. Parking is very tight and limited."}
{"text":"Just love this place...makes for a great date night dinner!! They are always friendly and food is always great. The lighting is a little bright, but that's our only dislike."}
{"text":"Great food, nice atmosphere, good wine selection."}
{"text":"New veggie lovers' spot, Fern, has a wonderful rustic vibe and comfortable feel with a big patio outside and an expanded interior (they must be doing something right!) I love their mason jar chandelier!   But the real treat is in their inventive menu, changed on a regular basis.  I have heard the OM burger is fantastic but I opted for the pot pie, but instead of chicken, there was lots of squash and mushrooms in a wonderfully flavorful gravy/sauce and instead of a pastry top or puff pastry (which I think is a travesty) was a deliciously crunchy croissant that was perfect to dip into the pot pie. It was a dinner party in my mouth and definitely crave worthy. I could have it weekly.   My sister in law got the wild mushroom risotto which was tasty, but definitely more of a rice bowl than risotto. It lacked the typical creaminess of regular risotto but was surely more healthy because it was made with brown rice.    Their service was fantastic and friendly as well.   I was shocked to hear that it was the same ownership as Something Classic which for me is hit and a big miss, but not as surprised to hear it's the same as Halcyon at the Mint. Apparently it's tough to get in for dinner, so I really look forward to making this a regular lunch gathering spot and trying dessert. Hooray Fern!"}
{"text":"Update: We went back to Fern this weekend for brunch and it was a beautiful day to sit on their charming patio. The server told us they'd recently changed the menu so we tried something new (vegan Chicken Bacon Ranch sandwich) and something we've had once before (vegan Breakfast Nachos). Both were top notch, but the sandwich was the star. It had excellent flavor and a unique take on bacon using coconut flakes. The only thing that was lacking in the meal was the coffee, which is odd because I've had their coffee before and it was great. This time it tasted like cheap Folgers. But it was a minor issue compared to how great everything else was, including the vegan biscuit with house-made blueberry thyme jam.   We enjoyed Fern, especially how cute the interior of the restaurant is. (The photos online don't do it justice.) We stopped in a few weekends ago for Sunday brunch. I ordered the biscuits and gravy, my husband got a tofu skillet and we split cinnamon rolls for dessert. My dish was great and very filling, but my husband was a little disappointed in his skillet. It tasted great but wasn't nearly enough food so I shared half of mine. (He had his heart set on the vegan nachos listed on the online menu but they weren't listed on the menu in-house.) The best part of the meal was the potatoes that I chose as a side for mine. We were both really excited about the vegan cinnamon rolls, but unfortunately, they were a bit lackluster. They were slightly burned (probably shouldn't have been sent out like that) and not at all doughy like a cinnamon roll should be. But overall, we loved the place and will definitely be back next time we are in Charlotte. They also have a beautiful patio that we'd like to try out."}
{"text":"While this place has great ambiance, I won't be back. I really have had better tasting vegetarian food elsewhere :("}
{"text":"My husband and I are visiting Charlotte for the holiday weekend and gladly found this gem. It's in a quaint shopping center but the restaurant looks like an old house. Very trendy. So many delicious items to choose from, ranging from vegan options to vegetarian options and gluten free options. I had the vegan + gluten free biscuits and gravy. Phenomenal doesn't even begin to explain it. The portions are very generous unlike most vegan places so I had left overs. They also had $2 bloody Mary's and $5 mimosas. Can't beat that! Oh my husband had a the \"chicken\" ranch bacon burger and it was so tasty! We both had the tomato bisque on the side which was cashew based and so delicious as well. All in all, it was a 10! Great ambiance, food and service. We will be back!"}
{"text":"1st customer ever and 1st to review, wow what a privilege.  It was a dark and stormy afternoon when I decided to try this brand new Charlotte restaurant.  A little hungover from the night before, I didn't mind the gloom of the day, but knew I needed some nutrients ASAP.  As soon as you walk in, you know why they call it Fern.  The fern theme covers most of the restaurant and gives it a fresh feel.   A lot of the back wall has them hanging from it.  The lighting was quite intriguing as well.  Mason jars with bulbs inside hanging from the ceiling.  Quaint and homey, but yet still somewhat chic.  I was quickly seated and was told I was their first ever customer(besides soft opening I assume).  I could tell this place was a little different as my water was lightly infused with the freshness of cucumber.  I then took a look at the plentiful but yet rather concise menu.  As soon as I saw it, I knew it was a must.  SQUASH BLOSSOM HUSH PUPPIES!!!  I asked the waitress to leave me to my menu for a minute as I re-hydrated.  There was a diverse juice menu and they had tea with orange that sounded awesome.  That said, the water was just so refreshing that I stuck with that.  An alcohol menu did exist as well with gluten free beers and organic wines, but not what I was looking for on this day.  I ordered the rest of my food while waiting for the appetizer, but we'll get to that in a minute.  OOOOOOH, the squash blossoms!!  3 beautiful corn dog looking pieces of fried goodness .  Crispy exterior, with the best vegan cheese filling I have ever tasted.  The onion butter was sweet and subtle, the perfect accoutrement.  I highly recommend this as a starter.  Can't even really put it into words.  May have to go back soon and try to find the vocabulary to describe them.  I went for the OM burger as I just wasn't really feeling most of the other dishes of the day.  My waitress recommended the quinoa salad as a side and she was right all the way, amazing flavor for such a basic grain.  My cohort for lunch decided the mushroom \"risotto\" would be his dish.  I say \"risotto\" because it was made with farro, not rice.  Its still a risotto, just not quite what you first think.  Both dishes came out relatively quickly.  My burger was about as good as a veggie burger can be.  The chevre on top was definitely worth the extra $2 and made the whole thing so much creamier.  The soft interior of the burger matched with a nice crunchier exterior gave the feeling of a perfectly medium rare burger.  It sat a little heavy on my stomach, but that was kind of expected.  My buddies dish looked well put together.  I only got a bite or 2, but there was a trio of mushrooms, some tofu, and some other odds and ends added to a somewhat creamy farro mix.  The farro was aldente, which is how I assume it was meant to be.  The flavor was awesome, but I give it 4.5 stars on cohesiveness.  It just seemed like it needed to be bound a little better.  Not a complaint, just a personal preference.  All in all, one of the best lunches I've ever had in Charlotte and they're just getting started.  My only complaint would be that my pen kind of exploded in my hand as I signed off on the check.  Might want to splurge a little better than family dollar next time, lol.  This place will be on my list of frequented places from now on, even if its just to get some juice."}
{"text":"I thought \"vegetarian comfort food\" was an oxymoron until I visited Fern.   From apps to entrees to dessert to the extensive beer & wine list, this place is a new favorite of mine! Fern is a great place to bring non-vegetarian friends if they want great-tasting slow-food and treats that are as visually appealing as they are delicious. The staff is very friendly and helpful, and the food leaves you satisfied without feeling stuffed.   Some vegetarian menus only work in warm weather, but Fern is definitely a place you can go to warm up and fill up this Winter!"}
{"text":"Haven't done in a review in a while. While in Charlotte, I stopped in Fern. Found it via the Vegetarious app. Been in transition to cleaner eating. The ambiance is relaxing. Question about the menu was answered with detail. I'll likely stop in before leaving the area. Wish they had one of these on Virginia!"}
{"text":"In the search for more meat free options, I decided to give Fern a try.   The menu is simple and the service was friendly. I tried the curry wontons and  \"steak and potatoes\". The highlight for me were those wontons. They were tiny but packed a lot of flavor. I'd order these again! The house made seitan was good but I would have preferred better consistency and more sauce or topping options.   Overall, this place was A OK in my book. I may come back to sample some of the lunch sandwiches and other sides.   Stay tuned!"}
{"text":"My Mom and I checked out (IG) @fernflavors for the first time last night. My Mom is living (mostly) a plant based life right now and we wanted to check out a good Vegan restaurant. This was recommended by Dr. K ( IG @nuancefacialplastics) and they knocked it out of the park! Even for this non-Vegan, I was beyond happy with my experience and the food there! Definitely give it a try! We shared the Buffalo Cauliflower to start and Mom got the Chimichanga (OMG, good) and I got the Ramen  (yum!). The restaurant itself is small but comfortable and has a simple, pleasant decor. The kitchen is exposed so you can watch the Chef ? in action! Make a reservation to be on the safe side, but there was no need on a Tuesday at 6 p.m. I will definitely be back! #veganfood #cltfoodie #foodieclt #cltwine"}
{"text":"Had their Rodeo burger for a weekday dinner and loved it. The side veggies were fresh and well seasoned too. The place has a elegantly decorated inside and some outdoor seating as well. Will come back to try more dishes!"}
{"text":"I came in for brunch. Had a decent experience, the food was pretty good! I guess it's hard to compare \"fake\" meat to real meat. But I got the Chicken and Waffles, with chicken-friend tofu, and sweet potato waffles. The waffles were pretty tasty, I loved the sweet potato addition. The \"chicken\" was just Aok. I would have liked it to be a little crunchier."}
{"text":"The waiters there will give you stuff you're allergic to even if you tell them! Plus the selection is very sparse and it's like a side salad for like $14."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the atmosphere, the service and the food!  I had the Sweet Potato Reuben and the fingerling potatoes.  I'm not vegetarian but I enjoy eating at any restaurant that puts out farm fresh foods. That's what I got from Fern. Only negative, it's a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Visiting from San Francisco, my wife and I went to Fern yesterday.  I honestly think this is better than any vegetarian restaurant there - or at least as good as Green's, which is our gold standard in SF.  Friendly, casual atmosphere.  My warm kale salad was excellent, and the kombucha from Asheville was too.  My wife found her flat bread a little too tough/crunchy.  But Fern is definitely worth visiting."}
{"text":"Wow, what a great find.  I'm not a vegetarian, but this place makes me feel like I could be!  I've never had meatless food with so much flavor.  My girlfriend is a self proclaimed \"pescatarian,\" so she was excited to find a menu with so many options for her.  She had a vegetable ramen soup with a that had a great broth.  Not being the most well versed vegetarian, I went with the veggie burger.  It was a well seasoned/marinated tofu patty topped with all the usual suspects.  It was super fresh and tastier than expected.  I added goat cheese that was well worth the $2 up charge and had a side of fingerling potatoes to go with it for additional up charge ($4?).  The potatoes were great, but it would have been nice to get a small side with the burger.  A small pasta or potato salad maybe?  That was my only gripe really.  Paying $15 for a burger and side is pricey.  They had a $3 growler pour from a local brewery, which I took full advantage of.  The food was good, service was attentive and they had a beer special on Friday night.  I will be returning without a doubt."}
{"text":"My mom originally introduced me to this place and my husband and I have been regulars to this place for several months now. We love this place! We love the seasonal, changing menus (the side of local mixed veggies changes every day) and the fresh ingredients, the desserts are great (love the turtle cake and apple cake), you get super refreshing cucumber water, plus I get a night off from cooking! There have been a few times I've had an inconsistent dish. There are also a few items on the menu I feel I make better in my own kitchen. The parking is also inconvenient. However we love this place for date night and can indulge in yummy vegan food in one of my favorite and personally nostalgic areas of the city. We have brought friends here and they love it, too. I've been loving the falafel salad lately; it's very filling, the falafel reminds me of crab cakes and the curried banana peppers are so delicious. Planning on going this week for my birthday dinner and I'm very excited (: Love this place, try it if you haven't!"}
{"text":"Today my husband and I visited Fern for the second time. The first time was Mothers Day, so we had brunch on Sunday. I really enjoyed the food. I also enjoyed the customer service. The servers were welcoming and pleasant. Today I had the Sweet Potato Reuben and the fingerling potatoes with a root beer. I thoroughly enjoyed all three. My husband had the OM Burger which he stated was equally enjoyable. I have eaten at several vegan/vegetarian restaurants in several states and I must say, I give Fern fairly high scores. I hope Charlotte continues to expand its vegan restaurant community like what is happening out west and in the northeast."}
{"text":"I've visited the old location a number of times. Now that they've moved, the parking is a lot better, nice patio facing East Blvd, walkable area (HT, SB & Duck's Donuts). The decor is similar to the old space and the food & service is still great! My faves are the buffalo cauliflower, ramen, vegan pesto panini & quinoa salad! I would definitely recommend this place for all your vegan food cravings!"}
{"text":"Gave Indian tacos a try and they were just ok. Maybe I will return and try some of the other recommended entrees."}
{"text":"I am always up to try new things, and don't get me wrong I eat plenty of vegetables and don't really avoid them, but I believe that this was my first official visit to a vegetarian/vegan restaurant. That being said, by suggesting to the wife that we eat at Fern hopefully scored me some brownie points.  The restaurant was not busy on the Saturday night that we were there, maybe vegetarians go to bed early. I chose the eggplant curry because I certainly wanted something flavorful and it delivered. It wasn't too spicy but had a little bite to it. I was not asked about spice level when I ordered. The wife had the mole glazed tempeh. This dish was not conceived with me in mind as those two things are some of my least favorite. Who am I kidding, I hate both mole sauce and tempeh. I did try it however and yeah it's not for me, shocker. Oh I almost forgot the wife wanted to try the cauliflower poutine as an appetizer so we shared it. This dish was definitely poutine inspired, but poutine it was not. Flavor was ok, but whenever the word poutine is used, my picky side comes out. For dessert we shared the peanut butter beignets, which had awesome flavor.   Overall, a good vegetarian experience and prices were decent. I can see some people complaining paying that much for just veggies, but you can't please everybody. I would definitely bring vegetarian friends here."}
{"text":"Who is not a fan of having a dining out experience and feeling good after?  I finally had the chance to try this place. So yummy. I love the romantic lil ambiance ...simple, but elegant with rustic wooden tables, long linen curtains, light fixtures made out of mason jars.   We shared the warm kale salad, OM burger and the peach cobbler. Salad was very good and different as it was warm... I really enjoyed the beet dressing. Something new!   OM burger was fantastic! No bread needed. I wasn't jumping up and down about the dessert, but it wasn't sweet so it was good for diabetics.  I went on a Thursday and they had 1/2 off bottles of wine! Always a plus :)"}
{"text":"Best Vegan and Vegetarian brunch in all Charlotte. The weekly pancake collaborations and breakfast sandwiches are incredible. My wife and I find the best appetizer to be the buffalo cauliflower."}
{"text":"Love Fern!! One of my favorite Vegan/Vegetarian restaurants in Charlotte!! The food is amazing, the staff is great!!! Can not wait to go back and try something else!!"}
{"text":"Wontons, fabulous! Beet salad with vegan cheese, flavorful! Steak & Potatoes looks like REAL steak! Customer service needs a little attention. Only issue with food- it was a little too salty for me. Will be back! Amazing selection of food!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by the other day for a casual lunch. We had heard about it at the VegFest and were very curious to try it. We are both vegetarian and were eager to try a place where we could order anything on the menu. I'm glad to say we were not disappointed!   I had their portabella steak and cheese sandwich, and my husband got the naked OM veggie burger. Both of these dishes were fantastic and full of flavor. The marinate for the portabella steak had the perfect amount of spice without being too salty. I got a side salad with their house dressing. The slivers of zucchini were a great touch, and the dressing was delightfully tangy. The OM burger had a great constancy, and was cooked well.  Great flavor! The fried potatoes on the side complimented the burger well.   Why not a five star review? Although the flavors were amazing, but the sandwich and the burger were a little dry. The homemade buns/rolls were light and had a great taste, but there was too much of them. The OM burger was great, but was very dry. I wish there was less bun, or more dressing. The sandwich had the same problem. I also wish the side salad had smaller lettuce leaves. I know it's kind of a minor complaint, but the didn't cut the lettuce leaves at all, which made it hard to eat.   Other then those two minor complaints the place was fantastic for a casual lunch or dinner. Very cute decor, very flavorful food. I will enjoy going back there and can't wait to try their other dishes!"}
{"text":"Though not much has changed with bathrooms or the parking since my last review, but I have a few factors that bump up my thoughts on Fern per my last visit.   Queen's Feast drew us in with the menu lineup for the week and boy, oh boy, was it incredible. Big bonus for several of the items landing on the regular menu, too.   Deconstructed onion soup. Whoa. Great broth, incredible flavor. Savory, a hint of sweet, and the presentation makes it rather fun. The server pours the hot broth over the dry/veg ingredients in the bowl and then mixes all together. The parm crackers served with are wonderful.   My first experience with their \"chicken and waffles\" and I'm a believer. The fried tofu could probably fool firm chicken nugget lovers into thinking it as meat. The waffle and spicy syrup -- magic.   Huge plus for having some leftover 12oz bottles of Highland Cold Mountain. We drained a few, which worked nicely with the meal.   Looking forward to working Fern in more regularly. Next up: Brunch."}
{"text":"I am not vegetarian or vegan, but after eating there I was seriously considering becoming one.  The flavors were amazing!  The staff was friendly and quick, the ambience was warm and inviting...and if you go try the om burger....incredible."}
{"text":"I would eat here every week if I could afford to. My only complaint is the prices, but the food is incredible. Do yourself a favor and order the fried buffalo cauliflower. It's the best I've ever had, and I've had a lot of buffalo cauliflower as a vegetarian and a cauliflower connoisseur. Fern is a beautiful example of carefully crafted vegetarian food with lots of flavor. The pesto panini is really excellent, as is the tomato soup. I've also gotten the ramen bowl. It was very good, but only if you really love mushrooms. My partner got the fried burrito. I thought it was too heavy to eat something that big that was also deep-fried, but the flavors were great. The fingerling potatoes are really delightful and crispy also."}
{"text":"Went here for a work lunch today and we were all very surprised. none of us heard of it so when the one lady suggested it we just went along. None of us knew it was vegetarian but we all found something we liked. We got hummus and the bruschetta for appetizers and they were VERY good. Lots of flavor for vegetarian food. I got the flat bread pizza and it was so good. I did get a choice of a side and I saw in some of the other reviews someone mentioned they weren't given a choice but we all were, so maybe this is something they added on? overall very good food, and very unique atmosphere. you really relax with how the place was designed with the \"breathing\" walls I like to call them, they have plants in a trough type thing on the walls VERY cool. they serve cucumber water which is SO refreshing. I'd def give this place a try for something different if your tired of the same old burger joints."}
{"text":"I drove past this vegetarian restaurant and turned around to grab a fresh juice and salad for carryout, but would love to go back for a nice sit-down meal with a friend. Fast and friendly service, great pricing, and the juice and salad were fabulous. The restaurant is comfortable and cute, clean, and has great ambience. Looking forward to hitting this place again when I'm back in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Very cute restaurant, very nice presentation and very good service. The location is also very cute. Now about the food. I have huge respect for any vegan restaurant that doesn't make you eat flowers and grass . However  I feel that the food could taste better here. There is potential to make the food great. We had eggplant flatbread which I loved the bread part more than the eggplant. I ordered chimichanga which the inside filling tasted like sofritos from chipotle only much saltier. The shell was very crispy and tasty. Whoever does their baking is doing a good job. My husband had \"ramen\" bowl with plant noodles I think he enjoyed it, but was not excited to get not the actual noodles.  Food needs improvement."}
{"text":"Great vegetarian Loved buffalo cauliflower and the ramen type bowl  Excellent waitstaff always helpfull"}
{"text":"Some of the best food I've ever had. A must try even if you are not a vegan or vegetarian. Great service, clean, transparent. You can see the kitchen from any seat inside the restaurant. Large patio outside as well. Very friendly knowledgeable staff."}
{"text":"I'm on the Daniel Fast and this place EXCEEDED my expectations! 8 had the Polynesian cauliflower and walnut risotto. The ambiance is amazing and the music was GREAT!!"}
{"text":"The buffalo cauliflower is the best! Oh and we can't forget the beautiful and delicious tasting chimichanga! As a vegan living in Charlotte this is my go to place!"}
{"text":"Service is excellent, and the menu is creative and fun.  Prices are reasonable, and the food is healthy and delicious.  What more could one ask for??"}
{"text":"BBQ cauliflower and cucumber infusion water was the best of my experience. Tikka masala sweet potatoes were exquisite. Spaghetti zucchini & meatballs pomodoro sauce need more flavor and for desert We have coconut orange cheesecake it was standard but if you match it with a Brown ale or an stout beer it taste delicious!"}
{"text":"I officially believe I could be a vegan every day for the rest of my life after eating here.  Do yourself a favor and order the Buffalo Cauliflower. Life. Changing.  Many, many compliments to the chef."}
{"text":"As a meatatarian aka carnivore, I was a little skeptical about eating dinner at a vegetarian restaurant. But eating here, I didn't miss my meat at all. The BBQ cauliflower was amazing, it would make you think you are eating a BBQ chicken wing. The cucumber water was refreshing and the roasted Brussels were a little spicy for me, but if you like spice/heat then go for it! I must say that if you're a meatatarian like me, you won't be disappointed by giving up your meat and eating here."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to come grab a bite to eat when I am looking for something light, healthy, and refreshing.  Their brunch is amazing, I am obsessed with the quinoa cakes.  WIth their side salads they always add in a few zucchini noodles which I love.  However, I am not giving them 5 stars because I have tried almost everything on the menu and there are a bunch of things that I actually do not like, but this is due to my food preferences rather than the meal itself.  I do wish they would add some more menu items for me to try."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this vegetarian place for a while and I'm glad I finally got around to it. My friend and I shared the red chile tempeh tacos which comes with Indian fry bread and crumbled tempeh. Very good and more than enough for 2 people sharing items. We also had the Moroccan tangine which had a really wonderful orange and cilantro flavor that lingered in your mouth. This dish tastes really good with the toasted pitas they provide although 3 tiny little squares was not enough. We asked for more and scooped up the rest of that lovely dish. Next was the huge bowl of signature ramen. Don't think noodles when you see this on the menu. It's made with zucchini noodles, mushrooms and tofu. They also give you some fried seaweed crumbles to put on top. Very good on a cold night. We also both had freshly made juices that were a nice addition to the meal. For dessert we shared these awesome, warm beignets filled with chocolate that were served in a brown paper bag dusted with lots of powdered sugar. They were accompanied with some raspberry sauce that I ended up licking from the plate. Needless to say, they were yummy! I will be back!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of veggie food, so I was really excited to try this place. As others have noted, the ambiance inside is very inviting and cozy. You certainly don't feel like you are off of Central Ave in Charlotte--rather it feels more like a restaurant in Asheville or in Vermont. Very quaint.   I came for lunch and had the Warmed Kale salad with goat cheese cakes, which was really quite delicious and perfect for winter. My lunchmate had the Om Burger which also was good. Her side were the sauteed vegetables (also very good) s which came in a cute little tin.   Less enjoyable was the coconut blueberry cupcake, which was too dense and didn't really taste like coconut. Also, the service was a bit spotty. While we were immediately seated and served quickly, and our water (cucumber-flavored!) glasses never were low, we were a bit annoyed that the server asked to take away our plates a number of times before we were done. Not sure what was going on with that.   The minuses, however, are nothing that would keep me from coming back. Great place."}
{"text":"I felt great the entire time.  The new location is perfect, with a great view of East Blvd.  Service was consistent and with a smile. Risotto is what is making me want to come back even sooner.  Well done."}
{"text":"The Queen City seriously lacks vegetarian options, but Fern surely makes an impact to fill this gap.   Reservations are highly recommended. Walked in once and there was no room...not even to wait, unless hovering over a dining patron counts. Second time, we knew better and got a table with our name on it.   The food is good. We started with a cheese plate. Nice selection and well presented. The food was very flavorful and made with fresh ingredients. The cucumber water added a nice, refreshing touch.  The service was good, attentive, and friendly.   Like others mentioned, to make this even more of a perfect experience, there are a couple things I'd recommend. When you walk in, if it's windy or cold (yes, it's been a season or two since I was here), it all comes in with you and you get stares from everyone. It would be great if they installed a revolving door. Like I said earlier, there's no waiting area (who knew they'd be in such demand?) due to maximizing the dining area.  Overall, great experience and fresh eats designed to please everyone in your party!"}
{"text":"Goodness I love Fern. I'm so glad it's in Charlotte. The food is so good that my meat-eating parents left full and without complaint about their vegetarian meal. The food is creative and with variety. Some dishes are clearly with an Indian influence, others lean towards southern or south of the border.  For dessert, we tried the vegan chocolate cake, which was so good, my parents couldn't believe it was made without dairy!  Go here, bring your friends. Aside from the food, the decor is also adorable - mason jars line the ceiling, and there are ferns planted into the wall. It's just the best. Charlotte should have more places like this one."}
{"text":"Fern is one of my favorite vegetarian restaurants in the country. Every time I'm back in Charlotte, I make a point of coming here and bringing several people with me who otherwise wouldn't be eating vegetarian/vegan. I've recommended Fern to many people solely based on the quality of the food.   However, I've had several bad experiences now with the individuals working here, including those in management. They have actually turned business away on what seems to be slow nights rather than properly planning out their tables. We were at Fern the other night (just four of us) and were told we couldn't get seated on this random weeknight unless we chose to sit at the bar. Meanwhile, we watched a group of three sit in the middle of an 8 person table, with three extra seats on one side and 2 on the other... + there were at least two other open tables.   Fern, because you choose not to treat all customers equally and make an attempt to accommodate customers (who are even willing to wait for a table!), you have now lost my business and my recommendations to others."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Fern but not my last. It's a great option of cuisine there in Plaza/Midwood; vegetarian.  It was a spring day and sunny so my husband and I snagged the last table outside. We got there around 1 on Saturday and they offered the brunch menu that May or may not change seasonally. I'm not sure. Regardless, yummy. I ordered the strawberry lemonade smoothie which tied me over perfectly until my \"chicken\" and waffles arrived. Those were great! Deep brown fried goodness over firm tofu triangles. Those were served over waffles that were not as firm and crusty as I like them but maybe the ingredients they use don't get that way in the waffle iron. The syrup was sweet and spicy.  My husband got the eggs Benedict which had great textures going on.  He also got a cocktail although I don't recall which one but was fantastic. Also note that the drink specials board said from 1030-3 on sat and sun Bloody Mary's are $1!!!"}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, I was really looking forward to Fern.   We went with friends and while two of the four entrees were very good, two were a real disappointment.   The food was cold, service was average (at best) and restaurant was cold.    Go with the servers recommendation as they are probably still working on perfecting the other dishes."}
{"text":"I never ever leave reviews, but Fern deserves a review.  My husband and I went here for the first time yesterday for birthday dinner, and I think that this was the best birthday dinner I have ever had.  I was very skeptical about buffalo cauliflower tasting too much like cauliflower, but I assure you, we were both blown away when we bit into it.  The buffalo cauliflower here is AMAZING.  We also ordered a chimichanga and \"chicken\" Parmesan sandwich with fingerling potatoes to share...both were AMAZING. Would highly recommend those items.  I have found my new favorite restaurant.  Honestly amazing food.  Also, our server and the rest of the workers were incredibly friendly!  I would recommend this restaurant to omnivores and vegans alike."}
{"text":"Lunch on the outdoor patio felt like a special event.  As a vegan who is tired of portobello mushrooms and beans, this place offered so many delicious choices.  My non-vegan daughter commented \"best buffalo cauliflower ever...the dill was the surprise taste\"  and \"Chocolate Pots de Creme was to die for....better than regular (non-vegan) chocolate mousse\".   Love that the service was attentive, sides were generous portions and take out containers were sturdy.  Good value.    Now please come to Chicago and open another Fern in the Windy City!"}
{"text":"Just wanted to give this place a shoutout because I had reservations with them yesterday.  It was my first time and I was so excited that I had invited 8 ffriends.  Evidently there was a car accident outside of their restaurant and they lost power.  They called me as soon as it happened to let me know and give me ample time to find somewhere else to eat.  I just thought that was very respectable and made me happy considering it was my birthday and it would've been a disaster to have everyone show up there and not know what to do.  Thanks Fern!  I will definitely be back very soon!"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful vegan and vegetarian restaurant that also offers raw juices and gluten-free options. I don't think you can go wrong with any dish you order. I went for brunch and ordered the 'Chicken' and Waffles. The waffles are made of sweet potato glazed with warm maple syrup and topped with the 'chicken', which is tofu breaded like real fried chicken with a bit of a spicy zing leaving your mouth watering for more is placed on top. Parking is limited, they don't take reservations and the wait is pretty long if you don't get there before the typical meal rush hours."}
{"text":"Aw, Fern. You are so charming. And gush worthy. I love steak so I can never eat at Fern for every meal but the decor, service and menu all hit a sweet (if not meaty) spot. Ugh that was awful-sorry folks. The serve delicious cucumber - so refreshing. Munch on the Om burger, Fried Squash Blossoms and Indian Tacos."}
{"text":"So delicious that you forget it's vegan! Do NOT skip dessert...it is surprisingly the best part of their menu!"}
{"text":"Maybe it was the mood I was in, but I really don't think love is too strong a word to describe my feelings about Fern.  We live in Raleigh and I sure wish we had a place like this here.  I'd happily pay $8 for a juice smoothie that healthy and good.  And bless them, they made me love Kale Chips.  Both my husband and I had the Spinach Fritata with marinated Tofu.. really freakin' good.  Cucumber water... mmmm.... made me so happy this place did."}
{"text":"This was out first excursion to Fern and we now have a new favorite place to eat. I'm a pescatarian and my husband is a self-proclaimed \"flexatarian\" (he eats meat when he feels like it). We had a tough time deciding what to try first so we ended up ordering too much food but all of it was amazingly flavorful and elegantly presented. I know that we will always get the buffalo style cauliflower....nice and spicy with a slight crunch to it. Our waiter, Michael was very informed about the meal preparation and helped us make a decision on what to try this trip. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I am sorry it took me so long to eat here! I had this place bookmarked for a long time before finally going to try it and it was wonderful, can't wait to go back.  Came here for dinner with friends on a Saturday night, we had made reservations in advance and I would recommend you do the same.  We had the fried plantains and bbq cauliflower for appetizers and both were delicious, I think the fried plantains were my favorite but they said the bbq cauliflower was a common favorite for people.  I had the omb veggie burger and it was good, the bun was fresh as was the burger made from white beans. I got a side of potatoes with it and the potatoes were wonderful, super crispy and delicious. Everyone I was with enjoyed their meals as well. The staff was super nice and I loved the atmosphere, such a wonderful place to eat."}
{"text":"One of the best vegetarian/vegan spots we have been too. The food was fresh, delicious and looked amazing. We went for my birthday with some friends who have all recently went vegetarian/vegan and we were blown away. From appetizer to main course to dessert everything tasted amazing and authentic. Even meat eaters would enjoy this menu and not miss beef or chicken. Can't wait to go back soon!"}
{"text":"The first time I came, I got the breakfast nachos and wasn't impressed. The service was bad too. After seeing everyone raving about the buffalo cauliflower, I decided to give it another chance, and I'm glad I did.  We got the cauliflower, of course, and the falafel skillet. The cauliflower was more than enough to fill the two of us. However, after a couple minutes it got cold and soggy due to the amount of sauce. The falafel skillet was amazing, loved the dill  Tzatziki.   In all, I'd return if for nothing else than the cauliflower."}
{"text":"My kind of place. Delicious food. Friendly waitstaff. Ambiance left something to be desired. Really gives vegetarian fare a good name. Parking was difficult."}
{"text":"Good that I waited 30 minutes to review. It gave me a chance to add the fifth star stemmed solely from the fact that the delicious flavors still linger on my palate. We had the Om burger and the Buddah Bowl. Burger was great. It was hearty and yummy. The Buddah Bowl (pink rice, lentils, roasted fall veggies and sautéed greens) was enough for two and a welcome take home portion for leftover tomorrow. The friendly and knowledgeable Monique had great recommendations. This place is worth a few more visits-if just to try out more entrees."}
{"text":"It is such a relief to find a restaurant where I don't have to double check that an unfamiliar ingredient isn't code for meat.  And it is all delicious.  I recommend the cauliflower appetizer and the schnitzel.    The \"cheesecake\" was delicious, but nothing like cheesecake.  This doesn't mean you should skip it.  Just don't expect cream cheese like food.  Expect frozen yumminess on a crust of dates and nuts that delights your tongue."}
{"text":"Fern is really a hit or miss sort of restaurant with my recent visit. The interior is still has a very nice and organic vibe. Perfect for taking out a vegetarian date, wait staff don't offer much explanation of the dishes when asked unfortunately which may have caused me to hate the dish I ordered.  I got stuffed peppers which I thought would be pretty big peppers stuffed with the rice and other stuff. Negative, they're tiny very spicy peppers that I could not finish. I also felt like I was eating a burrito bowl at chipotle with no lettuce or beans and mostly rice with a bit of seitan. SUPER BORING and would have turned me off to future visits if it wasn't for our other course!  My friend's dish was a delicious vegan bolognese. The sauce was so savory and warming on the cold rainy night we went! The umami imparted from the tomato sauce permeated the zucchini noodles perfectly while keeping a nice subtle al dente bite to them. I probably would've ordered another one of these dishes if anyone would have checked in during dinner to see if we were enjoying our meal.  Fern you're alright but maybe work on that service a bit okay?"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going to Fern since they opened and it's become a real hit and miss experience. Somedays the experience is so disappointing I never want to go back but then again, they have 2 dollar beers on Tuesdays and 1 dollar Bloody Mary's during brunch so what's a frugal lush to do?!   I've tried many of their dishes and had been wanting to try their Chicken and Waffles FOREVER and finally when that day arrived, I'd never experienced such a dining disappointment like that. First off it's WAFFLE NOT WAFFLES YOU GET ONE SUPER DRY FLAVORLESS WAFFLE. The vegan \"chicken\" was \"ok\" - the batter way too thick and fried a little too long. Underneath the chicken was that one awful waffle. The serving of syrup is way too small as well. It was like a shot of syrup. Another dish that was a big let down was the biscuits and gravy. The biscuit was as hard as a rock and the gravy had a sour aftertaste that reminded me of vomit. Sorry but that's what it made me think of. And their grits? More like grime. Slimy pasty grime. No never again.   On a posi note, recently tried the Chili Rellanos and the Taco Flatbread and both were awesome. Really fun and flavorful! The Chili Rellanos was fried to perfection and the batter was so light and crisp! It was fantastic!   One thing I feel I should mention in regards to our last experience is that Adam should not be a server, should not be a representative of Fern. He's rude, doesn't bring - or at least offer - glasses when you order a beer and is just in a word: unfriendly. Any other server we've had has been warm and welcoming. I don't like calling people out but anytime this guys been our server we haven't felt like we were appreciated or like a valued customer.   I'm not sure if we'll go back to Fern but if we do, I hope for more consistency with the food and service. I mean it's great to get 2 dollar beers and 1 dollar Bloody Mary's and Patatas Bravas is to die for as is the breakfast nachos but servers like Adam ruin the experience."}
{"text":"I had dinner here with my wife this evening, my first time eating here, her second. I will definitely go here again. The food was plenty satisfying and the service was some of the best that I've experienced in Charlotte. If you haven't yet tried this place, you're missing out!"}
{"text":"I made reservations for 7pm for my wife and I to celebrate her birthday. We chose to sit on the patio since it was a rare 70 degree February evening. We started with the Buffalo Cauliflower and enjoyed it immensely.  My wife had a glass of the house sangria and I had a bottled beer. For our main meal, I chose the Reuben with Potato Leek soup as my side and my wife had the Chimichanga. We both enjoyed our choices that we had no leftovers to take home.  We left pleasantly full and will be back again when we are able."}
{"text":"Best place I've been to!  Service was outstanding, food was amazing!  Waitress was the sweetest young lady and the chief came out to see how the new menu was!  Awesome people and place"}
{"text":"My husband and I went for brunch and he got the chicken and waffle. It was good, but I wouldn't recommend it or order it again. You just want one bite. I got the biscuit and gravy and it was DELICIOUS. We both loved it and would definitely order it again. The vegan butter and jam for the biscuits was great too. Good coffee!! I turned my meat eating husband into a vegan believer. The meal has kept us full for hours."}
{"text":"My wife and I eat at Vegetarian all the time.  This is the worst, DO NOT GO.  repeat DO NO GO.  !st the service was terrible. The guys saw we could not eat the meal served and did not care.  No one orders and then hardly eats any of it.  Second in this small place you could not even find him.  The food came out in literally 2 minutes.  It was so fast we joked that some one else ordered it and sent it back so they just gave it to us.  They serve beer but 1/2 of them and the one I wanted were out of stock.  Saturday nigh and out of stock on beer?  We got the BBQ Tempeh and the Budda Bowl.  The Mac and cheese as my side was so bad.  How do you mess up mac and cheese in the south.  PS I love Tempeh and make it at home a lot, Theirs was terrible.   Unfortunately I now have a new rule with my wife. I am not allowed to complain any more, ever again, so with our plates full I got the check, Adam our server did not care I paid my bill and left. I bet they served our dishes to someone else."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend and a friend. Was very excited as I love trying new places! I wasn't impressed with the food, and left feeling heavy. We were all very excited to try the vegan cinnamon buns....but they came to our table cold and burnt on the bottom. The rest of the meal was OK. Not very much parking, and if you try to park in the lot next to theirs, you will be asked to move."}
{"text":"The first few times eating at Fern seemed to be hit or miss for us. However, recently we have been going to brunch every other Sunday and have yet to be disappointed. I was never a big chicken and waffle fan, but their vegan version chicken-fried tofu and waffles is one of my favorite meals in Charlotte. I think it is the maple-hot sauce glaze that is the secret. It is delicious. Every time we go, I contemplate getting something new, but thankfully I keep going back to the waffles and reminding myself how good they are. I did have the huevos rancheros with tofu before and was a fan the first time I had it, was less thrilled the second time, but now it doesn't matter...it's all tofu and waffles these days.   The wife always gets the biscuits and gravy which does have some excellent tasting gravy.   Definitely recommend checking them out."}
{"text":"Pretty outstanding with awesome service. Another top three vegan restaurants I've been to in the last 10 years. A lot of pride in their crap and shit with all the food here. Beautiful atmosphere. Nice job"}
{"text":"I was doing a Daniel fast and wasn't getting tired of the meals I came up with on my own.  The buffalo cauliflower was AMAZING!!!!  I have dropped by for several to go orders of the buffalo cauliflower.  When I am in the mood for vegan, I will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"After listening to an omnivore rave up and down about this place, we decided to make this our first meal in Charlotte.  Initial impression is that this place is way cute - styled to somehow resemble a cozy little earthy dining room I guess?  Very \"fern-like\" and I think this would be a fantastic date spot.    Sadly they were out of the particular wine we had in mind, bummer!  It being half-off wine night, our server suggested a bottle of something not yet listed.  I can't recall the name, but it wasn't terribly good, sorry to confess.  And I think it was notably pricier than what we originally selected . . .   No big deal because the leeks appetizer ended up being glorious! I was almost sad about the modest sizing of the portion as we hastily gobbled down the leeks pieces drown in various delicious sauces.  My entree, the the BBQ tempeh steak was not very aptly named as the pieces were more like modest tempeh slices.  Seemingly steamed and coated in an more unique BBQ sauce - sweetest, maybe heavy on the fruit content?  It was good, but definitely not the best tempeh I've ever had.  The accompanying green grits and braised greens with sorghum vinaigrette were also nice, but I almost felt like I could have made much tastier versions myself (not that I'm an awesome cook, almost the opposite).  The serving size was ample for a nice and satisfying meal, but I resisted gobbling down everything on my plate because I wanted to imbibe in the hand pies - which we ordered to go, as it was getting super late and we didn't want to be \"those people keeping the restaurant staff from their homes.\"  The hand pies were good, but the candied pistachios were what I was totally in love with.    My companion had the zucchini ramen dish, which he proclaimed was surprisingly tasty.  I think he didn't know what to expect, mostly.  I nibbled a bit at the dried salty seaweed flakes, which are indeed super pungent (as per our server), but quite good.    Since this is like a 3.5 experience, I'll go ahead and 4-star it.  I wouldn't mind trying Fern again, but it didn't quite blow my mind.  I feel like I would have been more enamored with another entree selection."}
{"text":"Creative play with veggies. Here is my total review with pics http://tastefullygigi.blogspot.com/2012/01/fern-midwood.html"}
{"text":"Food is really great! Probably best vegetarian/vegan option in the city. But service could be improved. Arrived half an hour before closing and since the moment we walked in we were reminded about the time. Servers rushed-in and couldn't wait to pick up dishes and glasses from the table. They were in such a hurry that they didn't offer coffee or dessert. Understand we all want to go home but if you are still open and working do your best."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is relaxing & makes you feel at ease. The food on the other hand was disappointing. I grew up eating vegan and in the last 2 years have been trying vegan restaurants all over Columbus, Ohio. The food served here was extremely oily, bland or had an unpleasant taste. The wantons were like biting into a piece of ginger, the black bean burger had no flavor & the chimichanga was a pile of flavorless mush in a oily fried shell that became gummy after it sat five minutes. Not impressed"}
{"text":"Flavors from the Garden lives up to the name! Everything is super fresh and technically made right in front of you.  I ordered the Tuna Melt off of their brunch menu. I wanted to try something new so for me branching out I'd give it an 8/10. But on a regular basis probably a 7.  Their whipped peanut butter pancakes were to die for though!"}
{"text":"A comfortable, quiet dining area is a welcome change from the everyday experience.  The staff is helpful and ready to make you comfortable and satisfied whether you are a practicing vegan or just experimenting."}
{"text":"Am a vegetarian from Canada and my meat eater cousin was excited to show me this place when i visited. And we brought along another cousin who went \"vegan, really?\". Well the three of us had an amazing time with the friendly staff and enjoyed this moment together in this cute  little place where tasteful vegan food is served with love and joy.  We had the cauliflower buffalo wings (amazing!!),the burritos and the vege burger. Was not too crazy about the burger and the \"fries\" but the the two other items, OMG! My buds went \"comfy food!\".  I truly recommend you stop by and if I were to live in Charlotte (fell in love with that town), it would be one of my regular spots!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were visiting Charlotte this weekend and I wanted to check out the local vegan cuisine. Fern is conveniently located to downtown Charlotte. The decor is fantastic-- this place really has a lot of personality! The service was wonderful...very friendly, charismatic and hospitable. We sat in the outdoor dining area, next to their garden, which I thought was a nice touch. We had the smoked onion rings as an appetizer and they were delish! I really loved the vegan remoulade. On the con side, I did feel that Fern is pricier than it needs to be. I ordered the Tofu Pad Thai as my entree and I felt that $18 is too expensive for what is essentially just carrots, tofu, and cashews. I will say that it was pretty good though. :) All in all, I would probably return. Their brunch menu looks pretty tempting. :)"}
{"text":"Stranded in Charlotte waiting for our group to arrive at the airport, we contacted a friend to get a recommendation for a good vegan restaurant in the Charlotte area.  They suggested Fern, and boy, we're glad they did.  My wife and I travel extensively, we're vegetarian, and we have sampled many vegan or vegetarian restaurants all over this country, and Fern is without a doubt one of the best.  Wonderful use of spices, and great presentation.  Go there . . . vegan or vegetarian for sure, but even if you're not, and you like wonderfully crafted food, you'll love Fern."}
{"text":"Fern: Flavors of the Garden was one of the most beautiful restaurants I have dined in since my move to the Charlotte area eighteen months ago. The new location has a wall of windows that let in an abundance of natural light, accenting the soft green and white decor. At times I felt transported to a patisserie in the Montmartre neighborhood in Paris, at others it was as if I was in Malibu. No detail was overlooked, from the water glasses to the silverware, and the decor was chic, understated, and cool.  As a vegan partnered with a meat-eater, dining out can be complicated and breakfast is the worst! After investigating several options, we agreed on Fern because its vegetarian and therefore has eggs. When we arrived we were presented with brunch and lunch menus. My partner ordered apple pancakes with a molasses glaze and I ordered tofu breakfast nachos, both from the brunch menu.  Unfortunately for such a beautiful restaurant, we found the food to be rather disappointing. The apple pancakes had a strange texture and a bitter aftertaste, perhaps from improper use of molasses. i was particularly bummed about the tofu breakfast nachos (probably because they were mine!). The tortilla chips were nearly stale, and the tofu had clearly not been pressed. The liquid from the tofu and beans was poured over the tortilla chips, leaving a soggy mess at the bottom. Further, the tofu was bland and the whole dish lacked flavor.  I have hemmed and hawed over whether to give Fern three or four stars. The decor was simply gorgeous, and the natural light would make it a perfect Saturday morning spot for coffee and a crossword. I ultimately decided three stars because the food was lacking in flavor and my Saturday morning fantasy would be disrupted by Fern's glaring lack of an espresso machine. Lattes are THIS girl's best friend."}
{"text":"Feel good food in a calming atmosphere right there amidst the traffic of East Blvd; when you are ready for something a bit more than your fast casual lunch Fern gives you healthy options that bring the flavors!  We went halvsies on a curry burger with tomato bisque soup and a presto panini with sliced fingerling potatoes. Everything in our plates was colorful and delicious, but the potatoes stole the show. Who needs fries when you've got these bite-sized little guys?!  The morning was stressful with challenging meetings and driving around with roads full of yahoos who apparently needed to go back for some remedial coursework in Driver's Ed, but the small space with lots of natural light at Fern helped us relax and go to our happy place. Great service and it was only half full at lunch on a late summer Thursday. I'll definitely be going back to Fern!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely out of this world!! Stopped in as I was in Charlotte for the weekend and looked up vegan spots around town. This place popped up and was so delicious! We had the buffalo cauliflower and rodeo burger. The buffalo sauce and the dill dipping sauce were what set this place apart from other vegan joints I've eaten at. Such a pleasant visit and amazing service. Next time I'm in Charlotte this place is happening again!"}
{"text":"Wow. So this happened last night and I feel it is important to share, especially considering that I try to make the time for great reviews more than shitty ones. And, that I had no idea I had a reply from Adam, as I don't come here all that often--mostly to check out community reviews! My dear friend and his girlfriend were visiting from TX. They are Vegan and both gluten free because of health concerns (celiac). I'm gluten free because it changed the inflammation in my body significantly. I had forgotten that my last experience at Fern was so poor and suggested them, Luna's, or Perfectly Pizza for dinner. We decided Fern. My mother needs a cane at this point to get around and asked if I would mind stepping in to request an outside table for the four of us for our dinner. There was a man with three dishes in his arms coming towards the entrance/exit, so I held the door for him to get out onto the patio. He looked right at me and DID NOT smile or thank me, much less greet me. I walked inside and a waitstaff person greeted me nicely and then simply pointed to a back table and asked it if would do. The same man that I held the door for greeted us at the table and when I asked what menu items were gluten free (we only were seeing V notations) he replied with: Well, everything has gluten in it so That depends on how gluten free you are. He then went into a brief and seemingly (to All of us), mildly aggressive account of cross-contamination through cooking in a pan and then washing that pan, sharing a fry bath, or just plain gluten in an ingredient.  He then referenced the raw tacos, salads, and side veggies as acceptable. One of my friends asked his name and he replied it was Adam. We told him we would like a minute. One of my friends and I are both in the healing communities and perhaps a bit more sensitive than the average person to \"less than pleasant\" vibrations, especially from people handling our food. I happen to have about a decade's in the food service industry, mainly fine dining and still occasionally serve or bartend for a friend's catering company here in charlotte. I completely understand having an \"off\" day or moment. However, when you are in the service industry, shelving your person issues is fairly paramount to allowing the people that have come for a wonderful experience to happen.  We decided that we didn't want to try to balance his pissy energy and bounced to Luna's where we had a wonderful experience. I'm sure I won't forget this Last time at Fern. Too bad. It was always stellar over on Central. Adam, best of luck getting it all sorted out."}
{"text":"Fern is a perfectly adequate spot for vegan food and meals. Decided to try this place out during restaurant week so I could get more of a complete experience. My friend and I made reservations for a Thursday evening at 6:00 and were able to be immediately seated. I'm not sure if the night was typical or not but it completely filled up within the hour.  The parking situation for Fern is pretty nonexistent so your best bets are parking across the street in the Healthy Home Market shopping center. Fern is a cozy spot that's heavy on decorative charm: mason jars, twinkle lights, and the heavy placement of ferns (naturally) around the restaurant.  Back to the food and drink: We decided to go the cocktail route and started off with spiked teas. I found these pretty blah. The tea was quite weak and there just wasn't much flavor. For appetizer, we both chose the beet and goat 'cheese' crostini - a very delicious bite! The 'cheese' was really creamy and perfectly balanced the beet. First course: we both chose the butternut bisque. This was my favorite part of the meal. The bisque was hearty and topped off with pepitas (my favorite). It was also pretty to look at. Second course: fried tempeh with mashed potatoes and kale (I think it was kale). This wasn't bad, the fried tempeh had a nice crunch but, honestly, I did miss having meat during this course. Dessert: I went with the turtle cake and my friend went with the pineapple bread pudding. She absolutely loved her dessert and couldn't stop raving about it. I thought the turtle cake was all right. The cake was very dense and a little dry but the peanut butter mousse saved it.  I'm not sure I would go back to Fern for a full-on meal, maybe for a quick bite or for one of their smoothies/juices."}
{"text":"I like my meat with a side of meat, but I made a concession for a veggie friend I was meeting for lunch. We got to Fern around 11:30 on a Wednesday, and we were the second group inside. We were lucky to get a parking spot in front, and I loved the atmosphere - so cozy with a warm glow from their pendant lights, dark green walls (with ferns!), and dark brown wicker chairs.   I had checked out the menu online so that I didn't hold up the group, and we all wound up ordering the black bean burger ($12). I got the BBQ kale chips as my side; my friends got the fingerling potatoes. We all scarfed down our burgers, which came with lettuce, tomato, onions, and pesto. The kale chips were almost a little too crunchy since they kept falling apart when I'd pick them up, but they were tasty; however, I didn't get a BBQ flavor. The fingerling potatoes were grilled in olive oil and garlic - yum! The cucumber water was also a nice surprise and very refreshing.  Our waiter was attentive but seemingly a little peeved about their flatbreads - when we asked about the spinach artichoke flatbread, he gave us a monologue about how their flatbreads aren't really flatbreads since the bread is too thick, blah blah blah. Um, okay.  Overall, the food was tasty and approachable even for carnivores. I just wish it had been a little cheaper - with tip, my lunch was $16."}
{"text":"This place was very good. Nice lil chill spot for lunch. The carrot cake was delicious"}
{"text":"The atmosphere and decor were fabulous - what a great place to enjoy lunch!  (The photo here is out-dated).  Our meal was delicious!!"}
{"text":"So so wonderful! Quick and friendly service and great atmosphere. Had the rodeo burger, and it was the best bean burger that I've ever had! Fresh ingredients that don't taste bland. Try the berry bread pudding"}
{"text":"I have been to Fern on two occasions.  First off, the ambiance inside is super cute and delightful.  We were there early and were easily seated.  My first experience was dinner on a Thursday night (half price bottle of wine) and brunch on Saturday.  Dinner was amazing and deserves five stars.  My friend and I split the green gazpacho soup (I'm still dreaming about it) and seitan meatballs.  Both of our main courses (Indian Tacos & Laughing Buddha Bowl) were delicious and left us feeling very satisfied.  Overall, I felt the value of the meal was well worth it.  Next, I brought my husband there for brunch.  For the price, I didn't think that the brunch was deserving.  It was good, but I was hoping for something more interesting.   I will definitely be back at Fern, but  just for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"I'm giving Fern 5 stars because the food is top notch, flavorful, and wonderfully filling. We ordered the potato leek soup and the cauliflower buffalo wings. Beautifully presented. Now, we walked in as soon as the doors opened, we we're asked if we had a reservation. We said no, and were told to have a seat. We picked a corner table for two. My boyfriend moved the seat to face me since the seat was next to me. The server said we could not do that because the table behind us would have no space. So he moved the seat back and we asked to sit at another table. Two guys walked in and sat there and one of them moved the chair to face his partner and the server said nothing. Not a big deal, that's why I'm still giving a 5, but seating seemed to be a bit subjective to customers depending on which customers case in. We then were helped by another server. The food definitely makes up for the service at the beginning. Will be back if in the area again."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided on Fern for our 15th Anniversary. We are new to the Vegetarian way of life and thought this would be a great place to go and have more food options. Love the new location. Easy to get to and they have a parking lot! This sounds funny to some but not always a given in some of these hipster areas. We had been wanting to try Buffalo Cauliflower for a while and they had it on the menu. It was a huge portion that came out in a cast iron skillet. It tasted amazing! My wife is a life long Buffalo wing eater and she is from Buffalo to boot. We both agreed they were better than actual chicken wings. I took Kristen B. advise and our waitress on the Chimichanga. Everything about this dish was mouth watering from the main dish itself to the pickled onion side. I am still day dreaming about it. My wife decided on the Ramen Bowl. Great flavors. Loved the broth. Same problem with dessert. No room.   The wine wasn't the best deal for the amount and price. I however got the bourbon shrub. Which has been on my bucket list for a while and it was also fantastic! Lots of flavor.  I had two in fact.   Only down side was they didn't serve the Cucumber water like we remembered from the old location. My wife was bummed. LOL  Cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"The worst thing about Fern is that it's too far away from home for me to come back and try the rest of the menu! The atmosphere was a bit yuppified - the mason jar and hemp chandelier installation really sets the tone. Service was quick, attentive, and very friendly. It's all about the little details, like cucumber water and only serving in-state breweries' beer. They walk a thin line of pretentiousness, but the food and people are good enough to keep from crossing it.  I ordered the vegan ramen, and the boyfriend had barbeque tempeh. I have never had anything that tastes like my meal before. I mean this mostly as a good thing. :) His opinion: \"I really like it! It's fun and tastes really good, I'm just not sure what I'm eating.\" Seaweed flakes, coconut foam, and pureed something-or-another just aren't typically on the menu for us. I thought it was fun, but I'd hesitate to take any less adventurous friends or family.  Weird side note for coffee snobs - they use instant coffee! Not the \"real\" stuff. I actually liked mine enough that I asked where it was from and was surprised."}
{"text":"Fern proves that you don't need to be vegan to love vegan fare!  While I only came for lunch, I loved my meal so much. It was lite, I look forward to coming  back for dinner.  I met my girl friend here for lunch on a Friday. We were sat immediately. The staff is incredibly friendly.   I ordered the potato and leek soup. It was divine. It came with a slice of bread. The soup felt decadent, but I knew it wasn't because it was laking in cream. HIGHLY recommend. I asked for a side of goat cheese with it. The waitress came out with the largest side of goat cheese! It was so delicious.   My friend ordered the chimichanga. She really enjoyed it. It was  stuffed with tofu, which I'm allergic to, so I didn't taste it -- but it smelled good!  This cute little restaurant is such a Dilworth gem -- look forward to future meals!"}
{"text":"Fern is our favorite brunch spot!  Nice ambiance both inside and on the patio out front.  We have tried the muffins (flavors rotate) to start and enjoy the apple butter that comes with them.  There are a few staples on the brunch menu but I like that many items change week to week.  One of my favorite entrees is the grits that are often topped with some assorted veggies, vegan hollandaise sauce, and a vegan protein like tofu or tempeh.  My husband loves the brunch nachos, the chimichanga (from the lunch menu), or the tofu scramble. We have been here 6 or 7 times now and have not been disappointed!"}
{"text":"When I want to shock my omnivorous friends with uh-mazing vegetarian food, I take them to Fern! Many, many times I have heard die-hard meat-eaters rave about how delicious their \"Buddha Bowl\" is or how surprised they are about the textures and flavors in their \"Om Burger\".  Well done, Fern. You make us vegetarians proud!"}
{"text":"I've been to Fern a few times. Most excitedly, I came here for restaurant week, 4 Courses for $30, and vegetarian to boot!  Two words: buffalo cauliflower.   Anyways, I've been to Fern for dinner and for brunch. Each time I have been impressed. My only tiny complaint bring you room temperature cucumber water instead of ice water and when I asked for ice water, I was given strange looks."}
{"text":"The only reason why this place deserves 2 stars is because the buffalo cauliflower was their saving grace. And if you request more than the 2 drops of dressing on it, they charge you for it. Service was lacking and very unsatisfactory.   We also ordered the Alfredo flatbread that was so bland, cardboard would've tasted better. DONT under any circumstances order the vegan cheese. It was horrendous. Even the server agreed but did nothing to offer any solution.   We also ordered the \"falafel\" appetizer... the description said it was a classic falafel. What we got was nothing close to a falafel. It was so dense and raw dough-like. No flavor. Hard to swallow. Again, they were stingy with the dressing. The only way to stomach this dish is to drench it in the tzatziki dressing, which again they charge extra for.   I'm not hard to please as a customer because I myself am in the restaurant industry. I know how things go. I paid for food that wasn't good when I shouldn't have. Even something as simple as our server coming over (or the manager) and apologize would have been nice But we got nothing. Unacceptable."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Makes me proud to be a vegetarian. Awesome brews. Awesome food. Awesome service. Awesome ambiance. A plus plus plus experience!!!"}
{"text":"Great service, nice interior, and great creative vegetarian food with interesting flavors. I had the 'pork' dish and I sometimes think about how delicious it was as I'm drifting off to sleep."}
{"text":"The food is phenomenal! The decorating is unique and really cool! The service is snooty!!"}
{"text":"Eh.  Meh.  Amateur Veg cooking.  No salt.  Veggies cooked inconsistent."}
{"text":"Friendly and experienced staff who are knowledgeable about their product. Everything has a taste of perfection.  The Fern is definitely a place you should checkout if you are in the area. I also suggest sitting atbthe bar to get the best experience"}
{"text":"This is the spot! So my husband and I went here for his birthday dinner and had a fantastic time. I made reservations because we live in Virginia and were only there for the day. The food was outstanding and completed blew our minds because of the flavor. Being vegan seemed difficult when traveling but being at this place made me fall in love with Charlotte! Will be returning."}
{"text":"Chimichanga is very good but $18 is excessive for what you get.  Ordered it to-go and was hungry when I got done.  The burrito was small and they only gave me a few chips."}
{"text":"The service is kind, funny, and speedy!    Their food is so comfortable while healthy and hits the spot almost all using plant based ingredients.  On the mid price range for a fast restaurant meal, and well worth it to treat yo self."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were very excited to drop by this new restaurant and was not disappointed!   Highlight: The bruschetta rocked my world in ways I did not know it could be rocked.   The Vibe: unique and welcoming. This is a small restaurant with seats for around 30 people inside and maybe 15-20 outside. Combined with plain wooden tables and fun cutlery, makes this an intimate experience. The middle of the room has what appears to be a homemade chandelier made from glass jars. One wall has a large vertical fern garden (with real ferns!). It was well put together without overstating itself. I love it! Jack Johnson was playing in the background, which added to the relaxed theme.    The Service: Wow! These were some of the most attentive and knowledge staff I have experienced. I never wanted for water (which came with a hint of cucumber). The sourcing of menu specials were described (cheese from the Goat Lady). The server that we had was pleasantly talkative and I could see great opportunities for small talk, if that is your thing. Very courteous and friendly!   The Food:   - Bruschetta (deserving of 3 paragraphs): I am not a bruschetta guy; however, this was hands down the most delicious appetizer I have ever had. This appetizer lived up to the name and actually stimulated my appetite. In fact, we both were left craving more throughout the dinner to the point of seriously considering getting one more order for dessert (it's not sweet, just THAT good)!   This aint no red paste/salsa looking glob on a bread. No, it was asparagus, tomato, lion's mane mushroom (and some more veggie yumminess that eludes me at the moment) perfectly seasoned on a crispy, garlicky, buttery slice of bread.  The only possible downside is that the restaurant changes its bruschetta daily (or maybe weekly), so future experiences may differ. However, I fully place my bruschetta trust in the chief to deliver and WILL be ordering the bruschetta in the future.   - Arugula salad: This came with arugula, walnuts, pumpkin, and pumpkin seeds with a pomegranate dressing. The portioning of the salad seemed in-between a side salad and dinner salad. Definitely get a side or appetizer (bruschetta mayhaps...) if you are hungry.   Whereas certainly not bad, we both found the pomegranate dressing to be a bit too intense and sweet--overpowering the other flavors.    - CM Burger: solid veggie patty with toasted wheat bun. The patty was particularly enjoyable because it was not trying to be like a hamburger in texture or taste. This resulted in a crispy on the outside patty of veggie awesome. The toppings were fantastic. Only drawback was that the patty tends to fall apart easily, but this minor inconvenience is well worth the effort. Would get again!  - Side of Veggies: the burger came with a choice of sides. I choose the veggies, which contained squash, zucchini, carrot, onion, and green beans. These were sauteed perfectly, not soggy like defrosted mixed veggies. The green beans could have been cooked a bit longer, but a minor issue. Deliciousness comes at a price though--butter. And lots of it. Veggies can only taste this sinfully good with a large amount of butter. It didn't bug me at all, but it may be a concern to others.   Overall: Coming back again. Soon. Even though not a vegetarian, I really appreciate well-prepared vegetarian food. There is a lot of variety  and unique flavors at Fern and I am not done exploring yet."}
{"text":"Fern is the second veg restaurant in Charlotte I tried after making the vegan switch. As a super newbie vegan with very few options in the QC, Fern has become kind of a safe haven. The thing I appreciate the most is that everything is easily converted into vegan-friendly dishes.   The food is good, plain and simple. Herbivores and, dare I say, carnivores alike shouldn't have a problem finding something satisfying on the menu. Though, I have to say that brunch is my favorite. Their \"chicken\" fried tofu and waffles is delicious. It's a little spicy and a little sweet. And, their coffee with dark chocolate almond milk is just what you want on a Saturday morning.   I keep seeing people mention the Om Burger. I finally tried it tonight and it was disappointing. The bun, in particular, was chewy and too big. I finally decided to stop fighting with it and just pulled the patty off. My suggestion is to pick one of the other tasty menu items. Dessert on the other hand is fabulous."}
{"text":"I'm so confused.  I'm a meat eater at heart!  I don't do Vegetarian or Vegan restaurants.  No, no no, not for me.  Yet, here I am sitting at Fern for Brunch with a look of skepticism on my face, but also kind of interested in taking a chance on a restaurant where I've heard good things.  Ok, Fern, lets do this.  All good brunches have to begin with a Mimosa or Bloody Mary.  Both were reasonably price and made well.  Off to a good start!  Next I dug into some pancakes made with bananas and some toasted oats on top.  This is weird to say, but they were some of the best pancakes I've ever had.  Hearty with a bit of sweetness as I smothered it in syrup (which it didn't need, but it's syrup, so you have to pile it on).  Then came the waiter's recommendation of the steak quesadilla.  Surprisingly, it was delicious.  The wait staff was really great.  They were attentive and knowledgeable.  I never thought the day would come where I would recommend a place like this, but wow, it's definitely worth a try.  Perfect place to take your parents for a nice dinner."}
{"text":"very fun place and a great addition to charlotte. Very good vegetarian/vegan options and fun, creative combinations. I've been several times and will go back."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with the taste of the food. I would have preferred a \"hole in the wall\" restaurant with great food. The steak and potatoes was very salty. It tasted like straight salt. Even the broccoli was salty which really would have been fine steamed with no seasoning. I did not think it was worth the cost of the meal. Fern is a very cute restaurant with a great atmosphere. I love that they can customize your food based on whether you're vegan or vegetarian. Maybe I just chose the wrong dish but that was hypertension on a plate."}
{"text":"We had such a wonderful experience here, from the wait staff to the chef.  Everyone was so friendly and helpful, and the food was amazing -- flavorful, beautiful, and with great attention to detail.  We had the best vegan brunch ever (tofu scramble with potatoes and biscuits and gravy plus veggies).  The dessert was exceptionally good as well (pumpkin mousse layered with meringue and cherry compote + pumpkin seeds and a ginger cookie)."}
{"text":"We have only been once, on my birthday, and we found it quite cozy and hospitable. Since they were super busy when we arrived, we were seated in a sofa area while they cleared a table.  We tried a few appetizerss and a malbec. The Indian Tacos were a bit bready for me, but my guy gobbled them up. We also tried a Canneloni type dish and it was wonderful. Our server was very nice and helpful.  We plan to head back soon to try out the Om Burger.  Oh...and we learned they now take reservations ... always good to know. Great new find in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Beautiful chill interior vibe and nice, knowledgable waiter vegan brother. $2 beer special was a nice surprise .. But the big winner was the beet appetizer that tasted like tuna sashimi -- CRAZY. Bruschetta was amazing. Order Both. Eggplant park was pretty good but lacked a little flavor , but I asked for some hot sauce and that helped, but I wouldn't order it again. The Buddha Bowls looked good, prob should have ordered that. Pear salad was excellent. All in all a creative chef with fun vegan choices for Charlotte. Def worth it."}
{"text":"Really amazing salads and plenty of different options on the menu.They have a lot of vegan dishes as well. The atmosphere has a funky industrial shabby chic feel with cool lighting and mixed match plates and cups. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Would like to give this more stars but the service was terrible. First let me start off by saying the cauliflower was amazing! Loved the setting of fern and we loved the cucumber water also. Our server was one of the guys and he had his nails painted (no judgement just forgot his name) he was incredibly mean. We ate here because a friend of mine is a vegan so it was perfect for us. She heard there were specials so when she asked him he rolled his eyes and said we don't have specials and she said well what about the specials that change everyday...rolled his eyes again and had the one female server read us them. Every Time he came back to our table he would slam things down on the table and just act generally annoyed with us being there. He also tried to charge us extra for our beers. My husband asked to take home his salad and quinoa and the server only packed up the quinoa and threw out the salad. A bad server can really mess up a cool place. Not sure we'll be back. Maybe take out for two orders of the cauliflower."}
{"text":"Fern, Or Not ..Had very high hopes for this restaurant. I read all the Chef reviews in the paper , Must not be the same Chef now.  So we were a party of five , we ordered three appetizer Cauliflower Poutine, The Baked Gratin with Oatmeal Crumble and Tofu. Out of the three the Cauliflower Poutine was fairly good. Little tater totsmade out of Cauliflower and fake Cheese Curds...Not too bad. The Baked Gratin was not cooked correctly, the Butternut Squash was cooked but the turnip squash was hard, the crumble topping was not crispy... very odd. The Tofu was fine. Then I ordered the 200 year old Sourdough Flatbread-which is not flat and not bread..it is hard tack. It was described as having Scallop like Turnips and a Non-dairy bechamel sauce on it. Number they did not cut the  Turnips to look like scallops and the bechamel sauce was lacking any flavor at all.  Not any garnishes to make it a tasty flatbread lunch. Everything required more seasoning and flavor development, Nothing was even salted. My sister had the Buddha Bowl which had Black Forbidden Rice (undercooked)  and  large cubes of overcooked and undercooked vegetables. No seasoning again, and no beans as it was described to have them. Two of the others had the Warm Kale Salad, it was passable but not great.  My son ordered the OM burger it was missing flavor he said, like ordering a burger without  the burger !! We ordered Bloody Marys that had house made mix. It was nothing but watered down tomato juice with JUST horseradish. Not one garnish, or piece of lemon or a pickle or not a speck of pepper. Blah!!! and  7.00 dollars!!  All in all the place looks nice but should be a store and not a restaurant! I am so surprised at this Chefs craft. He needs to go back to the CIA and learn how to season and cook vegetables ---especially if this is his \"Vegetarian\"  Restaurant.. I will say I will not be going back at all....."}
{"text":"I always love going to Fern when I'm feeling vegan. This place is a great option for Vegans, Vegetarians, those that are going meatless for a while or would like to try something new.   I know I know it can be a bit scary experimenting with new places and not know if the flavor, taste, texture and over all yumminess that you're accustom to will be the same. Well I can assure you that all of that and so much more is in every Fern Dish. They season their food very well but its not over powering either. I'm a southern girl so I know about proper seasoning with food lol.   So the next time you're feeling meatless, vegan or just wanting to try something new check out Fern!  #yourewelcome"}
{"text":"A vegan and vegetarian restaurant with the creativity and skill to make meatless dining easy and enjoyable?  Yes, please!  The wife and I dipped in for lunch yesterday and had a great experience, on the whole.  Decor is fittingly \"fresh\" with the live fern wall, mason jar light fixtures, organically shaped silverware and artichoke-shaped salt and pepper shakers on each table.  The space is definitely small, with only one outside picnic table and then a couple rooms inside that feel a bit more like a retail storefront than a space designed for dining.  This is a trend, recently, but it was not a major distraction.  As we were seated and browsed the menu, we were served a very refreshing glass of cucumber water that ended up being my beverage of choice.  There is an entire juice menu, though, that is worth a look and my wife thoroughly enjoyed the finer honey iced tea- enough so that no sweetener was required!  The menu is divided into small bites, sandwiches and mains, but this was somewhat deciding as the \"small bite\" indian tacos I had were plenty for a full meal.  Unwise to this, though, we did start off with a side of the homemade root vegetable chips.  There were freshly fried discs of beets and sweet potato on this day.  Nicely salted and crisp, but a bit on the oily side- like they could have used another minute or two of draining and blotting before heading out in their little flower pot server.    As for the main meal, I found the indian tacos to be tasty and filling, even if taco is a bit of a misnomer.  I had three rounds discus of puffy indian fry bread loaded on top with a nicely-spiced bean and squash chili.  Textures and tastes melded nicely, but there was no way these things fold up taco style.  I ate then more like a tostada.  The wife's panini was also substantial- with thick slices of a multigrain bread and plenty of veggies inside.  The sun dried tomato pesto added a nice flavor to counter the mozzarella cheese.    Certainly the rest of the menu was tempting: the pot pie served with croissant, the om burger, even the buddah bowl all had high potential.  Not to be overlooked, though, was the new dessert menu.  Flourless chocolate cake, coconut cupcake, and an apple crisp all tempted.  Fern is the real deal with the kitchen and the cooks to make some amazing meals.   The menu evinces a dedication to local and seasonal sourcing and there is clearly some creative talent used in bringing these ingredients together to great a plate that is insanely fresh and tasty.  Bravo fern, what a welcome addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Will try again by calling the day before and specifying we don't eat garlic or onion. Disappointed in the irony that the OM burger had garlic and onion, when no true yogi eats such things. Perhaps with proper notice they will be able to accommodate our needs. The excuse that vegetarian food can't be tastefully flavored without garlic or onion is uber-lame. The food we DID get was decent enough; we hope with proper notice the chef can become creative. Cooking is an art that I hope they will learn. Anyone can throw pungent stink-veggies at a prep and call it \"tasty.\" For real money, I expect better. I have hope that next time, we'll get it."}
{"text":"I was on a 30 day no meat diet and needed vegetarian or vegan restaurant so I wouldn't run to carbs.   Nice little spot off of East Blvd. parking was truly hard to find. There are a lot of different businesses in the area.   The staff seemed to be eating behind the counter in a group talking. Except for the one lady that took my order, greeted with a smile.   The restaurant was clean.   I ordered coconut curry tofu and buffalo cauliflower. The food was pretty good. I gave 2 stars because of the party behind the counter and eating of the one worker. Touching your mouth, waiting on customers in the restaurant didn't seem sanitary to me."}
{"text":"The food was excellent, and it's about time that a good vegetarian restaurant has come into existence.  Now you've got to market yourself, Fern.  Go Go!"}
{"text":"Charming environment, good vegan selection.  Reuben sandwich was interesting, but not pastrami.  Oh well, it is vegan."}
{"text":"My daughter loves vegan and has been for about a year now, me, not so much. I decided to take her out tonight as a treat to this great little restaurant in a super area of Charlotte for a father - daughter night. As a non-vegan, I was really surprised with all of the food offerings and the fresh taste of everything we had. I had the Chimichanga, a huge burrito that was absolutely fantastic and my daughter had the broccoli alfredo which she raved about. Of course desert was just as super as the rest of the meal.  Caitlyn was our server and was very attentive, fun to talk with and had a lot of great suggestions and conversation.   We will definitely go back for more!"}
{"text":"Let me just tell you a little story.   This past Saturday, we planned a double date with our friends. They made a 5:15 reservation for all of us. Due to some scheduling conflicts, they arrived at 5:15 and we couldn't get there until 6. In the meantime, they ordered drinks and appetizers. As soon as we arrived, we order more drinks, dinner...everything was great.   Around 7:15, dinner was winding down and we were looking at the dessert menu when a manager came over and informed us we had five more minutes at our table. Apparently, another party of four was there with a reservation so they asked us to leave. We stated we were about to order dessert and he repeated that we would have five more minutes.   I might understand this if we'd been sitting at our table for hours after the plates had been cleared, but this was minutes after we'd finished. Perhaps they were annoyed that part of our party hadn't arrived until 6, but our friends had ordered plenty of food and drinks in the meantime, ensuring they were making money from our table. I don't think it's unreasonable to spend two hours at a nice dinner with friends on a Saturday night. Lingering over a glass of wine and dessert is one of the perks of going out in the first place. There were other four tops that had arrived at the same time as we did that weren't asked to leave.    Needless to say, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Amazing place! The ambiance is awesome and the service is second to none. They have a huge vegetarian menu with vegan options available. There is SERIOUSLY something for everyone! I ordered the chili and was shocked by the size of it. I was stuffed and verrrrryyyy happy afterwards.  I will definitely be returning in hopes to try some of their other dishes soon!"}
{"text":"Fern has become my go-to vegan restaurant here in Charlotte. As a fully vegetarian restaurant, they have an abundance of vegan options (listed as VO on their menu). Fern is tucked away on the corner of East Blvd and Fountain View Street. The interior gives off a farmhouse-chic vibe, with limited seating. Parties of 4 and up should call ahead as they do take reservations.  For brunch they have $2 Bloody Mary's and $5 mimosas, aww yiss! I suggest the chef's scramble with tofu or if you have a sweet tooth, get the cinnamon rolls. For dinner try the buffalo cauliflower, \"chicken bacon\" ranch sandwich, or chimichanga, and you won't be disappointed. Their tomato bisque soup is also amazing.  The more I explore their menu, the more my love for Fern grows  Keep up the amazing work!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Saturday around 11:30 where most places would be packed, but we were able to get a table for 4 inside (in the AC) right away! The service was attentive despite things taking a little longer than preferred to come out from the kitchen.  The menu was awesome! While we didn't order any specialty drinks, there was a diverse selection and they were reasonably priced. They even offered kombucha from Lenny Boy! I did splurge and ordered the cinnamon buns from the brunch menu for the table. Four large buns come out in a cast iron skillet and they are covered with an orange glaze. OMG, worth every single calorie! For my meal I ordered the Mediterranean bowl. I wasn't as thrilled with this as I had hoped to be, but part of that could just be me being picky because the food was perfectly fine. The bowl had quinoa, rice, hummus, and some greek flavored dips, so it was just a lot of mushy foods for my taste. However, the falafel that came on top were pretty much the most flavorful, moist, perfectly cooked falafel that I've ever had. So that was a major plus.  I'm definitely curious to come back and try more things on this menu! Very vegetarian friendly!"}
{"text":"in love with this place. awesome brunch menu...really tasty and flavorful vegan options. one of the best benedicts I've ever had, hands down. the fingerling potatoes were really well seasoned, too. cool atmosphere, unique light fixtures, quiet ambiance"}
{"text":"This is now my second visit to Fern and again I left happy and full, but not feeling at all disgusting, which I love! I am a huge fan of Fern and all the delicious yummy veggies they have to offer. The chef is a master at taking veggies and vegan cuisine to a whole new level. I still dream of the vegan mac and cheese I got on my first visit. This time I tried out the juices (so cleansing), the ramen, and the OM burger with avocado. All were delicious and flavorful. But for the second time I got the cauliflower poutine and man does it dress to impress with flavor! I absolutely love this dish and am always tempted to lick the bowl, but figure it is not polite. The staff is always very pleasant! Down to the very cucumber water that is served, everything at Fern is tasty and delicious! Can't wait to return to try more!"}
{"text":"Truly vegetarian!  I became pescetarian by choice. I took almost an hour drive for dinner in Charlotte. And I discovered this place! This is a very decent veg restaurant. I enjoyed my dinner in their outside seatings. I liked all the items on their menu. I ordered fried rice with Tempe and Lima beans. It was fancy and well presented. At the same time, quite delicious. Do try one of their smoothies. I was pleasantly surprised by the presentation of the meal. I told waitresses that I feel like I am on a date with myself, which is great. The overall experience was great.  The staff is friendly and very attentive. I could not ask more for a nice meal and better service. I think Friday night well spent with a good meal and walk in the Plaza midwood hood.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"At first glance I wasn't understanding why they sat a party of 2 at a table for 6 but our party of 5 decided to wait it out. I'm so happy we did... we tried the fried cauliflower which was a bit on the spicy side (we probably would have liked it best with the buffalo sauce on the side for portioned dipping), pesto sandwich and the Alfredo flat bread. Hubby loved his sandwich which had a perfect almost buttery crunchy finish and I was really impressed with my flat bread.  The desserts were seriously the highlight of our meal.... the carrot cake will for sure be a crave worthy dessert I will think about for a long time.  If we were locals we would probably swing by here on the regular."}
{"text":"I'm not particularly interested in vegetarian restaurants. Now that I've tried FERN, I've changed my tune a bit. I found the food there quite interesting and inventive. Was here with my 7 year old daughter and my sister for a Sunday Brunch. I had the Zucchini and Spinach Benedict. I'm a big guy and I love meat, but this dish was very filling. Felt very full but not stuffed like I needed a nap after eating here. Decor was cool. We liked the touches of the mason jar lighting. My only gripe was waitress was a little weird, not very attentive, and the seating just felt really open like I was sitting with the table next to us.  I'll be back again."}
{"text":"- People tend to dress down at Fren, so be casual. - Painless parking.  - Fren specializes in hearty plant-based food, featuring locally sources ingredients. - Seasonal crafted menus, including brunch. - Unique décor.  - I had the Vegan steak and potatoes but I wasn't really impressed by it. However, the carrot cake was amazing.  Three Yelps"}
{"text":"The Bruschetta is my pizza replacement it's that good. The falafel salad is so delicate with a touch of crunch and the caponata is to die for!  10 million stars! My favorite vegan place in this state!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food. As a vegan I am always excited to try new places to have a meal that I don't have to cook myself! Was my first time trying Fern out and the flavors were amazing. Love the details in the restaurant, all the way to the silverware. The service was great, and it was a really great spot for a relaxing lunch. Had the Cobb salad and tomato soup, both amazing."}
{"text":"I REALLY wish I could give Fern a glowing review, but I just can't .  I'm not a vegan, but I eat vegetarian and vegan food fairly regularly.  My husband and I ate brunch here twice on a friend's recommendation, and I wish we hadn't wasted our time.  The staff and the environment is lovely, and everything on the menu sounds delicious.  Unfortunately, the execution leaves something to be desired.    The best part of my meal (both times!) were the scones and jam.  I've had the chicken and waffles, which most people rave about -- but honestly, it was pretty bad.  The seasoning on the tofu 'chicken' was good, but it had been badly pan fried, and the texture of it just wasn't right. The spelt waffles were the worst part. Not only were they flavorless, but I couldn't even cut it with my KNIFE! So sad, because I was really excited about it.  The Ohm Burger failed to meet expectations as well.  My husbands meal each time was no better, so after this last failed attempt, we decided not to come any more.  The best way to sum it up is this: I feel like the people who have reviewed it at 4 or 5 stars don't know any better.  Real 5 star Vegan cuisine (like what I've had in D.C., NYC, and L.A.) doesn't taste like an \"ok\" alternative compared to the \"real\" thing---- it just tastes amazing. The food here definitely does not fall into that category.    Maybe our experiences were a one-off. But I highly doubt it.  I really wanted to love Fern, but I just can't."}
{"text":"I had really high hopes for Fern, a place touted by my veg friends as fervently as evangelists. But I've gotta say, meh. The menu descriptions are fantastic, and I should've gone for the Buddha Bowl, but instead I was lured by the sound of mushroom bacon. Disappointed, which should surprise no one (but me). Similar ehs from everyone around the table. I tried to spice things up with the housemade hot sauce, but that wasn't even hot, just salty. I loved the service, knowledgeable staff and friendly, cozy vibe. But I won't be going back for the food."}
{"text":"I've been to Fern about four times, and each time I was pleased with the selection. The brunch is quite good--I usually go for the \"chicken\" and waffles for brunch. My boyfriends likes the eggs Benedict. For dinner, I've had the pumpkin risotto, which was a little disappointing and the \"fish\" and chips, which I really enjoyed. The Om burger is good, too.   I like that this is a rustic restaurant--small, intimate, you don't have to dress to impress, and you'll get quality service, good food, and a trendy place to dine."}
{"text":"Honestly, if I wasn't a vegetarian, this place would get 4 stars, but to have a full-vegetarian restaurant open in my neighborhood makes me completely dork out, so I'm as happy as it gets.  The space is absolutely adorable...an earthy green color covers the walls with an open layout and fresh decor.  The place is small, but didn't feel crowded, just intimate.  The menu consists of small plates, salads, and entrees.  There is plenty of diversity to please veg and meat-eaters alike (they also let you know which dishes are vegan and which can be made so).  See Shauna H.'s description of the food we ate as she was my dinner mate.  The service was attentive and friendly, the food lovely, and the atmosphere charming.  This is definitely a go-to for me from now on."}
{"text":"Great vegetarian restaurant!  Fun hip environment.  Had kombucha, hummus appetizer, and squash filet dinner!  It was out of this world!  Great service too.  Had to provide a credit card to make a reservation.  Will be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!! We went to The Fern for Thanksliving and it was work every freaking penny. We heard around that everything here is yummy and that was from both omnivores and herbivores. So good!! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Being a vegetarian and living in Charlotte, I was thrilled to find out about this place. I've eaten 2 lunches, both very nice and one dinner. Overall the flavors are great, but I don't connect with the place. I've always left a little hungry and thought it was a little too expensive. I don't mind spending money on quality food, but don't think you should leave hungry for the amount you spend. So, it's not a place that I'd go regularly. Although, I'm in that area almost daily. Great food, better for lunch than dinner and if you're not a vegetarian, I think you'd be even more disappointed.  My mark for a good vegetarian restaurant is that your meat eater friends love it as well. Sorry, but glad others are liking it."}
{"text":"My better half and I came here for dinner during restaurant week and were pleasantly surprise that there wasn't a wait for a table. We were also lucky enough to have visited on half price bottle of wine night, which in my book equals buy one get one free! Our server was very friendly and attentive and helped us navigate the menu and figure out how much we should order so that we didn't have left overs, which we didn't because everything was delicious!  The ambiance was intimate and inviting and I absolutely love the handcrafted chandelier that added an artist, warm lighting. Dear Fern, I will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Excellent and flavorful place for vegan and vegetarian options. A bit pricey, but I expect that aspect for vegan courses in Charlotte. Just don't ask for diet coke unless you want to see your waiter get a bit salty. ;)"}
{"text":"A special shout out to the GM, Lou, who helped me coordinate the UYE here! She had two tables reserved for all of us and she and the staff were top notch with tending to us, serving food and drinks in an incredibly timely manner, and checking up with us regularly.  This place was a pinch difficult to find at night. No lit up sign, the windows are covered with green curtains (so from outside it looks quite dim), The easiest way to navigate to it is to look across the street from Bistro La Bon (or two buildings over to the left from Slate).  The water here was really good. Not rubbishy tap water. It was filtered (or distilled?) and had a hint of cucumber to it-- quite lovely. I tried their special warm sangria: warm red wine, brandy, spices, and bits of apple and orange. Excellent for a chilly night.  I tried an Indian Taco (which I was confused about how it was Indian, aside from the naan shell... I got more of a chili-over-bread impression) and the Roasted Vegetable Panini with yellow squash and sun-dried tomatoes, and root veggie chips on the side. I think a more adventurous flavor could be placed in the panini-- and the store-bought ciabatta could be replaced with a house-made whole grain/sourdough or something. Anyhow, both were satisfying and pleasant but nothing to rant and rave about."}
{"text":"Fern was absolutely AMAZING!  I have been a veggie girl for almost 10 years, and this was by far the best vegetarian restaurant I've visited.  The service was wonderful.  The staff was extremely knowledgeable about preparations and available substitutions.  You even have the option of making certain dishes vegan.  The decor of the restaurant was delightful.  It was quaint, sophisticated without being stuffy and very appealing to the eye.  And the food.... ahhh!  We ordered multiple items so we could try a little of everything Chef Alyssa had to offer and each item was delicious.  The flavors were fantastic, the veggies were crisp and paired together beautifully.  Do yourself a favor and check it out.  Carnivore, vegetarian, vegan... you WILL NOT be disappointed."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic, however service wasn't the best. We sat at the bar/counter area and seemed to be neglected by our waiter. After ordering an appetizer, we waited awhile to order. The waiter passed multiple times and we couldn't seem to get his attention. When he did come he apologized, which I appreciate. The buffalo cauliflower is amazing and leaves you almost no room for an entree! I would definitely return, but just be cautious about how busy it will be."}
{"text":"I feel terrible to be giving Fern only 3 stars because I love everything that it stands for in this city of Bojangles and Cook Out. I love the service and the atmosphere and the general vibe. I love that I can go there with my boyfriend's sister, who is a strict vegetarian, and that she's blown away by the options and variety. So, I love a lot of things about Fern.  I don't love all of the breading. I don't eat gluten and it sucks, especially when you go to a place where gluten-free items are labelled, but somehow that makes it even more painful, because there's a total of about 6 such items...none of which sound terribly appetizing.  Anyway, last night I got the spinach and artichoke risotto, which tasted great, but was not exactly a filling meal. I was hungry about an hour later after eating what was essentially rice and vegetables.  The sangria kicked ass! They have a house-made white sangria that was incredibly refreshing and worthy of at least one star on its own.   It was nice to sit outside, although we had to share a big picnic table with another party (our fault for not making a reservation, I suppose). Service was friendly and quick. Prices were high. 3 of us got a meal and a drink each (no appetizers, no dessert) and it was $77 before tip - yikes.   Sorry, Fern, but I can't say that I'm, personally, in any rush to return. Keep doing your thing, though! You're one of a kind in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Give me all the vegetables! If looking for your daily dose of veggies, Fern will deliver.   On my first visit, my party of 3 sat at the long, communal table in the middle of the small restaurant. From our central location, we could marvel at the beautifully decorated space and spy on what every other table in the place was ordering. I loved the rustic feel of the dining area -- wooden farm tables, shabby chic shutters on the ceiling, miss-matched chairs. Super warm and welcoming spot.   We spotted the buffalo cauliflower appetizer at a neighbor's table first and knew it must be ours! I'm so glad we ordered that as it was the highlight of the meal! Piping hot with nice crunch, the hot sauce was balanced perfectly by the buttermilk dill sauce. And, all that was topped with carrot and celery confetti. That's right, folks. Confetti. Of carrots and celery. That takes \"throw some confetti on it\" to a whole new level. I don't think I'll ever be able to look at confetti the same way again.   For my entree, I had the \"tuna\" melt. It was tasty, but not at all what I was expecting from the description. Because it included wakame, I thought it would have an Asian flavor. It didn't -- not the end of the world, just threw me for a loop. If I was in charge of naming this menu item, I would probably call it The Warm Hummus as chickpea is most certainly the star of this dish. The chao cheese was a new adventure! If I hadn't know it was vegan from the menu, I would have thought it was a slice of provolone. I had the veggies as my side. They were pretty unremarkable. After scoping out other Yelper's photos, I probably should have gone with the fingerling potatoes.   The food here was SO filling! We went for lunch at noon, I took half my sandwich and veggies home, and I'm still not hungry for dinner tonight at 7pm. Ironically, I was planning to make meatloaf for dinner. Suppose it'll have to wait until tomorrow."}
{"text":"Excellent food and staff! Adam and Matt were so helpful with our party! The food was amazing, I can't wait for the new menus. The cheese board is insanely good (all vegan cheese). The chimichanga and the squash filet were winners as well. This place is as must try. I know we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, there were a couple things I didn't care for but overall we were happy with the food. Nice vegan choices. The drinks were not good. Neither of us enjoyed. Cute decor, good service."}
{"text":"My wife and I are not vegetarian but after eating here several times, we are considering it. Every time we come, we enjoy it even more than the previous time. The food is excellent, the service is amazing and even the music is great. Definitely recommend it 100%. REAL TALK!"}
{"text":"Wonderful! We had the mushroom Bolognese it was wonderful along with a simple Fern salad. Everything was so fresh and full of flavor. The desert was my favorite though, chocolate pots de creme. My new favorite place to eat when you want something super healthy but it tastes decadent!"}
{"text":"October 1st was World Vegetarian Day and the dinner group met here to celebrate!  I am not vegetarian but I do enjoy occasional vegetarian meals and am so glad I finally was able to try this place.   We were supposed to have a group of 12 but you know how people cancel at the last minute so we ended up with 7.  No problem.  The restaurant was quite accommodating.  We just took away a table.  Speaking of tables, loved the reclaimed wood tables!  I need to get one of those!  Our server was excellent in explaining the beer specials and the dinner specials.  I had eyed the menu on the web and ordered the Laughing Buddha Bowl and it did not disappoint.  This bowl had sweet potatoes, okra, pink rice, greens and a few other things in a mild broth.  It was quite a large bowl of food.  Had one of their desserts as well, a sweet potato mousse.  It was interesting.  I was expecting it to to be creamy but it was actually frozen in a chocolate shell.  Still good, not overly sweet which is a good thing.  It just wasn't something I was expecting.  Still a great dinner.  Definitely need to come back here again."}
{"text":"We were excited to learn about an all vegetarian restaurant in town. We went there last night and found the food to be \"good\".   Service: Excellent - The waitress was really informative, enthusiastic and kept our drinks full and food on time.   Ambiance: Mellow, rustic and relaxing. The dining room is small and intimate, and the decor is muted colors with rustic decorations. Very quaint.   Food: Good - We got the Indian tacos, a somosa appetizer and the OM burger. I could not taste any Indian influence in the Indian tacos. They tasted like normal tacos. The samosas tasted fine and came with an onion chutney and creme sauce, but nothing that really stood out. Our friend said the OM burger was pretty good. The food presentation was beautiful and creative though.   Price: Reasonable - Prices were on par with other restaurants in the area.   We will definitely go back and try more offerings, and are very thankful for a vegetarian restaurant. It's definitely tasty enough to return many times, but it was nothing I would crave or bring out of town guests to."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian/vegan, but I try to do meat-free mondays and do veggie dishes when possible.  However I am sensitive to spice, so places that pile on heat to make up for taste are generally not going to work for me.  Fern started out promising - they don't carry cider or any sweet white wines that would suit the palate of a picky goof like me, but they do have some ($8!) juice blends.  (The blend tasted like 80% celery tho, not a great time).  Appetizers came out, and from the odd almond cheese, to bruschetta, to fried cauliflower, all was good.  I'd recommend the cauliflower or bruschetta to anyone, the cheese is a bit scarier.    However my big mistake was doing the Om Burger as my main course - with roasted tomatoes, avocado and goat cheese, sounded pretty rad.  I've done veggie burgers or garden burgers now and then, so I'm used to them being made of a mix of beans, soy, corn, whatever.  This burger...I knew on bite 1 that something was wrong.  Spiced cucumbers were on it so I removed them just in case, but with every bite came heat to the point of pain.  Knowing my own sensitivity I had my wife try a bite, since she is hispanic and more spice-friendly, but no good.  It felt like they added spice by the boatload to make up for lack of taste - not necessary when you have that much going on in a burger.    The burger came with the finger link potatoes, which some have described as crispy or salty, but mine were bland and mostly soft.  Not much browning or crispiness.    After this disappointing combination, we splurged on dessert - usually I wouldn't spend more money after this type of experience, but we were with friends and they were partaking.  They had what was basically a large ring ding, with peanut butter in the middle, drizzled with chocolate all around.  This...this was a good time.  If you are in the area and need a good dessert, that alone is worth the trip.  It's still highly priced for a dessert ($8) but easily feeds 2, so not a big problem.    I might come back if in need of apps/desserts, or if feeling adventurous down the veggie/vegan path again, but otherwise not."}
{"text":"Vegan/vegetarian food prepared beautifully ! A more upscale vegan restaurant. The dress is casual but the prices are more expensive then other vegan/vegetarian places . I got the vegan pork cutlet and it was delicious ! Would Definitely get again. Can't wait to come back !"}
{"text":"Just came from lunch at Fern.  I would post photos but after 50 minutes our entree never arrived.  We did eat the Buffalo Cauliflower as our appetizer.  It was tasty but a little too oily and spicy for me.  The waiter recommended the chimichanga so we ordered that as our entree.  We watched three more tables order and and eat their entree.  After asking our server about our order, we watched another table be seated, order, and when their entree arrived we decided it was time to go.  I went in to ask for my bill and then waited again for the server to arrive with the bill.  Finally went in with money in hand to pay before we left.  Finished our lunch at Sunflour Bakery just down the street.  It was delicious.  Fern has a nice patio for sitting and waiting."}
{"text":"This is an excellent restaurant.  They have a great combination of fake meat style foods and non-fake meat style foods.  20+ year vegetarian and I usually skip the veg restaurants because so commonly the menus are based on making everything look, taste and smell like meat which I find repulsive.  I like eating vegetarian foods and don't feel I'm missing out on eating meat.  That said, many people do miss meat or just want an ethical break from it time and again.    So this was a home run because my colleague and I were both able to find something we loved.  And all of the food was well prepared and beautifully presented by a happy waiter.  We had a spectacular meal."}
{"text":"The food is very delicious! I had great service from the waitress, and the waitresses all had friendly smiles. However me and my table companions, did not feel welcome by the manager. THE MANAGER was the unfriendliest, atleast to US.  He came to our table three times to bring out different things during our visit, never once spoke or smiled or said \"you're welcome\" to our \"thanks yous\". We saw him go to two different tables with heterosexual couples and he was friendly to them and spoke to them. THIS IS THE MANAGER!!!!! As an employee of a restaurant myself, this was so unacceptable. I don't know if his problem was with our sexuality, or our race, or if he just didn't like us, but to talk and smile with other tables and never open your mouth to us, as guests at your establish especially as the manager, it's disgraceful. I'm not sure I will return as we left feeling unwelcome. I believe the waitress said the manager on duty was Adam."}
{"text":"The ambiance: More outdoor seating than in (in a good way!) with cute cafe tables and a fountain with a big tree and hanging lights.   The food: I started with the buffalo cauliflower and it was an excellent alternative to buffalo wings. The cauliflower was crisp and the sauce was on point. Even my meat-loving boyfriend thought it was great. For my meal, I had the kale caesar salad. I was very impressed with the vegan replication of a caesar dressing.  I also tries the buffalo chicken burger and I was deeply impressed with the coconut bacon. I do not like coconut (it is the sole food I am not a fan of) but this \"bacon\" had no noticeable aftertaste of coconut and was SO CRISPY. We finished with the lemon cheesecake. Great flavor, certainly not as dense as standard dairy cheesecake but the taste was fresh.   The staff: Considering my boyfriend was a bit fickle about the tables because of the angle of the sun (moved twice) the wait staff was still friendly to us!  This particular experience was very average with regard to the staff - no complaints but my life wasn't changed."}
{"text":"Disappointing. I visited 3 times before I left a review to be fair. The first time the food was fabulous. The second time, not so much. The 3rd time....I probably won't be back. I got the spaghetti and meatballs every time. The second time it was just blah. Tonight the meatballs came out burned. When I told the server she said \"they are?\" I said yes....not to mention there were obvious burn marks which show in the picture. She said they would remake it for me. A manager brought it out to me but didn't apologize or anything. They were not burned but they tasted like they were. The spaghetti was hot but the meatballs were just lukewarm and tasted nothing like the first time I had them. I'm sad because I live in Plaza Midwood and this place is so convenient."}
{"text":"Round two at Ferns and I must say I'm still impressed! To start off I tried their Apple Pie Smoothie, however it was way too sweet for my taste. Other than that the rest were phenomenal. My friend's Sweet Potato Tikka Marsala was absolutely amazing. Definitely, worth the try! The Miso Ramen was another great dish to try, especially when it's a little chilly outside. Last, but not least was the scrumptious Coconut Orange Cheesecake. I'm usually not a dessert eater, but this is by far one of my favorite desserts. I highly recommend eating at  this place whether or not you are vegan/vegetarian."}
{"text":"The food was imaginative and delicious. However the service was disjointed, confusing and slow."}
{"text":"I recently tried Fern, Flavors from the Garden, a purely vegetarian restaurant on Central Avenue. My mom was very excited to bring my grandmother here since she keeps Kosher and does not eat meat when she goes out. Fern is owned by the Something Classic / Halcyon folks. Halcyon is on my \"to-try\" list and Something Classic is great for lunch - love their new location on East Blvd. and their awesome take-home products and baked goods. Fern's dining room is fairly small, with plants (including ferns of course!) providing a calming decor. Hanging mason jars add to the homey, farm-inspired ambience.  Our experience with Fern was mixed. We wanted to much to love this place but we ended up leaving feeling disappointed. Of course this is based on one meal and I would like to try more of the menu items offered but first impressions mean a lot. Our party of three tried several things, taking recommendations from our somewhat aloof server.  The highlight for me was the fresh Fern salad with cashews and a delicious herbed vinaigrette. Suggestion: serve some bread on the side. With the addition of avocado and cheese (available to add at additional charge) and some good bread, this would really hit the spot. The roasted cauliflower was my second favorite menu item we tried. The pistachio-pepper brittle added a nice sweet crunch and the squash/sun-dried tomato purees provided additional highlights. You can sense the chef's creativity here, which I appreciate.  The disappointments came with the veggie burger and the eggplant/zucchini parmesan. To me the veggie burger was just not that flavorful. I've had veggie burgers made with nuts that tasted so much better. Also the bun was so huge you could not eat this as a burger. I ended up giving half the bun to my mom (to have with her salad) and cutting the rest with a fork. This could easily be fixed with a smaller bun. The NC Hoop cheddar did add a nice flavor to the burger so if you are not vegan I definitely suggest cheese. The quinoa salad tasted like quinoa with lemon juice to me - the balance of flavors was off.  The eggplant/zucchini parmesan sounded so delicious but there were a couple of problems. First, grandma had a really hard time cutting it up in the bowl it was originally served in. The problem was that the eggplant skin was tough to cut and getting to it in the bowl was difficult. We finally asked the waiter to put the dish on a plate which he hesitated to do because \"it would ruin the presentation\". Well.... since she could not eat it that way I don't think the presentation really mattered anymore! The dish was also underspiced to me and although there was ample cheese it did not seem well incorporated with the dish - either you got a huge chunk of cheese or veggies with tomato sauce.  There are several other menu items I'd like to try at Fern including the beet tagliatelle and the Tribal tacos as well as the arancini. There is really a wide variety here so hopefully next time we will have better luck with the food. In May a Farmer Dinner was offered which sounds fun as well - perhaps they will offer this again soon."}
{"text":"This place will turn you vegan/ vegitarian! There is not one dish on the menu so far that I didn't like"}
{"text":"My husband and I are visiting Charlotte for the day, and I was in charge of finding dinner for the two of us - a vegan and a vegetarian.  Little did we know we'd happen into a restaurant open for just two days!  Had we not read so beforehand, we'd never have known - nothing in our dinner would have belied that fact.  Service was smooth and efficient, servers knew all about the menu, and everyone worked with confidence and pleasure.  We enjoyed our entrees - the Three Sisters Cakes and the mushroom risotto.  Both were hearty and flavorful without being too filling.  We also ordered the Squash Blossom Hush Puppies as a starter and while we enjoyed them, I take issue with the \"hush puppies\" label.  They're really more of a jalapeno popper, with a batter-fried exterior enclosing a creamy vegan cheese and squash bossom.  I'd been hoping for more of a twist on a traditional, cake-y hush puppy.  That issue aside, we were pleased with the whole experience.  The restaurant's decor is both dark and cozy while still fresh and airy.  If we were locals, we'd certainly be back for a nice date-night meal out.  Since we're not, the least I can do is leave a positive review and hope it sends more business their way."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. I went here recently with a friend for restaurant week. The food was delicious as always. Their menu changes frequently but I am always pleasantly surprised at their unique offerings. I would definitely recommend the bruschetta as an appetizer. I really enjoyed the Chile Con Tempeh as my main dish. The stuffed peppers in the middle are delicious! Their dessert options are great as well. This is a great and unique place to go if you're in the mood for something fresh and innovative."}
{"text":"I ordered the Ramen.....delightfully delicious!! I'm so impressed that I ordered two more entree \"To Go\" I would consider moving to Charlotte just for this place!!"}
{"text":"Upon walking into fern I immediately fell in love with the cozy interior. It felt a bit like walking into a good friends dining room.  My one complaint is the ladies room is shared with the catering business and is quite a far walk - and fairly unsightly walk at that. So maybe it is more like walking into a good friends dining room - who just moved in!     Our service was friendly although a bit spotty toward the end as the night grew busier. We were able to be seated on a Friday night around 7pm without reservations but I suggest having them if you dine later then that as the place definitely fills up.   They  had a lovely list of organic wines - I cannot recall exactly what we had but it was a nice red in the upper 30 range. They have an extensive list of juices that I definitely need to try out next time. The complimentary cucumber infused water is absolutely delicious on its own. We shared some small plates as our meal we had the harvest salad, goat cheese cannelloni, braised artichoke, and the bruschetta du jour. The winner of the night  was the delicious brushetta which was so tasty. I also enjoyed the canneloni - and could tell the pasta was homemade. The only dish  I cannot recommend is the braised artichoke which was overcooked and lacked flavor. The entire meal came to about $80 for two.   I will definitely put this place on my list of local dining spots!"}
{"text":"Happy Veganniversary to me! I've been vegan for a whole year now and decided to celebrate at Fern...the only veggie friendly restaurant that I hadn't been to yet in the Charlotte area. I used One Table to make a reservation through their website and we got there at 7 for dinner. It filled up quickly afterwards so I'm glad we already had a table. It's such a cozy and intimate restaurant and I really love the decor...Farmhouse/Spa chic, if there is such a thing. Our hostess was super cool, I think her name was Monica/Monique...shout out girl! Here's our dinner breakdown:  Onion Rings with Vegan  Remoulade: Dayum Gina! The onion rings were fantastic but what really set it off was the remoulade. When our next course came out the chef tried to take the dish with the remoulade off the table and almost lost a few fingers.   Sweet Potato Reuben (with red cabbage sauerkraut) with Kale Chips: The sandwich was good but a little to salty for my taste...I though it was the sauerkraut but the sweet potatoes needed a dunk in some water too. No biggie. The kale chips were amazing!  200 year old flatbread with Vegan Sausage with Fingerling Potatoes: Hubs ordered this and gave his old lady a bite. It was delicious!! It was a large flatbread too so it could definitely be shared. His fingerling potatoes had the perfect sear on the outside and were awesome!   Here's what topped off the night....DESSERT! We ordered the Vegan Peach Beignets and when I had the first bite, I went off to a land with unicorns and glitter! I think we got 5 or 6 of them so we tried to save them for dessert the following day. Long story short, hubs went to work before I did and I ATE...EVERY...LAST...ONE. I had to drive all the way back to Plaza Midwood from Gastonia to get another order.  Beignets saved my marriage, LOL!! Seriously...check this place out for some really good eatin' ...vegetarian/vegan or not."}
{"text":"North Carolina finally feels like it's getting on that plant based train with this restaurant! Some of the previous reviews made me skeptical about coming here, but I'm sure glad we did! My husband and I shared the wonton appetizer (because every review said they were good), tomato basil soup, and the Reuben with the potatoes. The wontons definitely didn't disappoint. The flavor of everything was great, just wish there were more than 3! The soup made me so happy inside being the temperature is dropping and the Reuben was very tasty. Their take on the Reuben was different, but if you expand your mind on the possibilities, you will be left pleasantly surprised and satisfied. As far as complaints are concerned, we didn't like the silverware. I know, weird complaint, but they are weighted so if you aren't a heavy gripper, the silverware will flip and turn in your hand. Also, don't cut with your fork. You know what I mean, flipping it to the side and cutting. It hurts. Finally, who doesn't serve a Moscow mule in a Moscow mule cup? Apparently, Fern."}
{"text":"I was visiting the Charlotte area and I was very pleased with both my order and the service. I was greeted right away by a friendly hostess who offered me the option to sit where I wanted. Since it was a nice cool evening, I sat outside.   I ordered the buffalo cauliflower because I had been craving wings for days! I must say the cauliflower was cooked and seasoned to perfection and satisfied my desires! I had a side of vegetable purée soup but it was quite a heaping helping so I did not finish it all.  That didn't stop me from ordering the carrot cake...the best Vegan carrot cake I've ever had. The chia icing was perfect and the cake was moist, the only thing I'd change is to remove the raisins, I hate raisins but that's probably a 50/50 thing with carrot cake lovers. You either love them or hate them in your carrot cake.  I'd go back any time and would love to check out the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Fern,  it's over. You messed up my OM burger and we're now officially over. Grabbed OM to go yesterday and the patty wasn't cooked all the way through. Hell, it was barely warmed.  And with that, I'll be spending my overpriced sandwich funds elsewhere. Bummer."}
{"text":"....just awesome. The risotto was out of this  world. Highly recommend! Service was very catering. Atmosphere easy and augmented the food."}
{"text":"I, like Hailey H, typically don't lust after veg-only restaurants, but after a visit to Fern I can honestly say that I'm still craving a bunch of dishes there!  The vibe inside (and on the patio) of Fern is great - a nice, chill and green accompaniment to their menu. Service was on point during my lunch and my server was well educated and happy to lead me through the menu. She also mentioned that she's not a vegetarian and loves the food...and hey, that means a lot to us carnivores. The menu features vegetarian and vegan options with many of the vegetarian items available to be made into a vegan dishes. I can hear all the vegans rejoicing right about...now.   My lunch buddy and I snacked on a few different items...all of which were good to great.   Iced tea: 4/5: I gotta say their regular iced tea (at least during the day I dined here), was orange and ginger! It was super refreshing and delicious.   Indian Tacos: 5/5: Three fry bread \"tacos\" piled high with a hearty mix of beans and squash and topped with lettuce, tomato and sharp cheddar. This dish was bangin' and very filling. Anyone who says veggie or vegan eats can't fill you up, must try this.   Squash blossom hush puppies: 4/5: Holy crap, I actually enjoyed vegan cheese?! Yes, lightly crispified squash blossoms filled with delicious vegan mozzarella with a side of onion \"butter\". I didn't go crazy over the butter but frankly, I don't think they needed them. The order came with three blossoms.   Buddha bowl: 3/5: Rice, a bit of faux cream, vegggies and beans presented beautifully in a bowl. The buddha bowl had potential but it was pretty bland for me. Everything was most certainly fresh, but I was itching for some spice somewhere in this big bowl of eats.   Overall, Fern was really impressive and I think they have a great menu, inspiration and focus. Can't wait to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. We had the Om burger and the Quinoa and Spinach Benedict. Both were delicious. The Bloody Mary was also great."}
{"text":"I'm certainly no vegetarian but I've been twice in a couple of weeks and really like this place. It's good to eat a little differently.   I've had the same thing both times essentially. My favorite is the Buffalo Cauliflower. It is breaded and fried and the first time I had it wasn't as heavy as the second time but both were very good and you'd swear you were eating boneless chicken wings! I mean it!   Both times I went I had the Thai Peanut Brussels Sprouts too and I really loved the Thai peanut sauce on these beautifully roasted Brussels.   My guests had the salad and added a black bean burger and the next time the pesto sandwich and both were very happy. Enjoyed sitting on the patio when it wasn't super sunny."}
{"text":"I tried Fern today and it was absolutely wonderful.  We sat outside because the weather was beautiful but did take a peak inside and it appeared to be a great atmosphere.  Be sure to ask about the Fern wall, it is very interesting.  Whom I expect was the owner was very friendly and informative!    Immediately upon entering the service was top notch.  Very friendly and educated staff (on the food that is).  I ate the OM Burger which was out of this world.  I have had many a \"veggie burgers\" but this one was definitely in a league of its own.  I highly suggest the goat cheese!  I had the quinoa as a side, and it was about as exciting as you can make quinoa but very good nonetheless.  This is definitely going to be a regular stop on the rotation!"}
{"text":"I am admittedly a pretty big fan of meat but I went to Fern last night to be a little more accommodating to a vegan than having her eat a side salad somewhere while I stormed through a steak.  We ordered cocktails, I had the Garden & Gun and she the Fellini.  Both cocktails were a little sweeter and less complex than I would like (by comparison we went to Soul afterwards where Kenan and Andy wrecked our faces with some delicious whiskey based drinks).  She ordered the Ramen, which came out more like a giant bowl of soup than she was expecting.  I had the Southern-Style Succotash, the Tempeh Steak in this dish was extremely tasty.  The service was great, and we probably should have quizzed out waiter more since I felt like I was ordering dinner on the moon.  All in all, Fern is probably pretty alright if you're sick of eating the one vegan/veggie item other restaurants have."}
{"text":"Update: Have been here for brunch and dinner multiple times and I'm still in love. I crave their biscuits regularly.  I went here for brunch and was really blown away by the selection and the quality! My mom and I are vegetarian and my sister is gluten-free, and it can often be difficult to find a restaurant we all have great options at. I had their gluten free biscuits with eggs and it was so delicious! I will definitely be coming back to try their lunch and dinner options"}
{"text":"The food was AHH-MAZING! I love vegetarian dishes but I had no idea what to expect. The restaurant is located in a shopping center with very limited parking. It has a small intimate setting with very limited seating.  I would highly suggest making reservations before visiting. There is a beautiful patio outside perfect for warmer weather. The staff was friendly, knowledgeable and the service was fast.  I ordered the Pork Cutlet made seitan, cauliflower puree, lentils and spinach. I was a little nervous to try the seitan because I've never had it. It honestly taste almost like chicken lol. My dish was flavorful and I loved it.  I also had the buffalo cauliflower and brussels sprouts as an appetizer. The cauliflower was tender, crunchy and seasoned to perfection. The Brussels sprouts were made with a maple sauce topped with coconut bacon. Both of these dishes were delicious.  Lastly, I  had the Chocolate Pots de Creme which a chocolate mousse topped with strawberries and whipped creme. The mousse with light and very flavorful. It was hard to put my spook down.   Overall the food was great and I didn't leave feeling stuffed.The only downfall about this place is the size of the place and the parking. I would've definitely give them 5 stars but the parking options are really bad. This is a must try."}
{"text":"I really really liked this vegan restaurant. They have the best fried Cauliflower Buffalo Ranch appetizer ever!!! If you only want to go for this one dish your visit will be so worth your money and time. It's awesome that their menu is so well done, it has explanations and details of all ingredients, keys for dietary restrictions and even paring options. Make sure if you're gluten free and vegan to specify it, the waiters are super helpful to guide you through choices and accommodate any dish if needed. Their vegan cheeses are so so good!!! Super high quality vegan cheeses. My daughter ordered the Chimichanga and she swears never before tasting such exquisite dish, it's a huge dish and there were no left overs. I loved the Leek Soup with Pumpernickel Toast and the Broccoli Alfredo was delicious (though not sure it was gluten free, so ask ask ask). The only reason I am not giving 5stars is because of their \"dog/animal friendly\" policy. Yes we're vegan, animal lovers, \"equality kingdom\" friendly, but I do not like dog sheds flying around, nor customers seating their dogs on seats where others will eventually sit, nor bringing their huge dogs with drools all around. Above all, this is a restaurant where hygiene, cleanliness and hair free environment should be expected. Despite this all, we were very pleased to see that our waiter washed her hands several times prior touching any of our plates and after petting dogs all around. So if this feedback helps in any way, maybe management can come up with an area for customers to leave there pets. All in all, this place has super great food, the plates are all very well sized which makes prices to be fair and understandable. If you decide to go for a first visit try another day that's not on an early Sunday as their brunch time gets overwhelmingly packed. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The food was ok... I got the 'Curry' white bean burger, which was too dry and bland. However, the side of vegetables was tasty and flavorful! The coffee wasn't hot and they only carry sweetened almond/soy milk and dairy half and half. The environment was nice. We sat outside and it was still cozy."}
{"text":"As an omnivore, I can appreciate the flavor and delicacy of vegetable-based dishes. I will admit, I do enjoy cow and foul and all the wonderful inventions they come in, but I don't need them, per say, to make a meal complete; I can be quite content with a dinner devoid meat. And we're talking about more than a bowl full of lettuce here.  So with that in mind, enter Fern. What a refreshing addition to the Charlotte culinary scene!   I was apprehensive at first (I have been to some dreadfully boring vegetarian/vegan establishments before), but I am so glad Leanne C. decided to host a get-together here and introduce this great restaurant to us! I enjoyed the more quiet ambiance and the soft earth tones that greet you. The mason jar pendant lighting and the wall of ferns and herbs (real, potted plants residing in pouches against the wall) created the right spark of whimsical fancy. The welcoming, personable staff complete the scene (and can talk about the menu items without sounding laboriously rehearsed).  Continuing with the fresh theme, I love the cucumber-laced water - a favorite I create at home during the summer. On this particular visit I also tried their warm sangria, a dangerously delicious blend of red wine, brandy, spices, and fresh fruit. The Indian tacos are a must-try; I love the bread they use for these! As a main course, I tried the roasted vegetable panini and, again, was thoroughly impressed. The vegetables had a rich, roasted flavor with the slightest hint of char, yet remained firm (I hate floppy vegetables).   I'm not saying I'm swearing off meat or anything, but with flavors like this, I certainly didn't miss it!"}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY AMAZING & so happy they opened the East Blvd location! My boyfriend and I had one of the best meals and experiences at Fern. The chef is masterful in taking creative takes of vegan choices that turn out beautifully. We started with the buffalo cauliflower and we were fighting over the last few bites! I got the chilled ravioli that has vegan cheese between tomatoes- it was delightful. Service was great, location is great, and the decor is sweet. Will be going back again soon!"}
{"text":"I am totally obsessed. When my fiance and I were first dating, he was on the \"steak a night\" diet. If you had told me three years down the road, he would be eating a roasted pumpkin \"filet\" and oohing and ahhing over it, I may have dropped dead on the spot. Seriously delicious food, even for omnivores like me!!"}
{"text":"I am not a real vegan but love trying new foods and eating clean when I can. My friend who is vegan told me how much she enjoyed the restaurant so I made it a goal of mine to try and boy am I glad.   We went one night for dinner and I'm glad we made reservations because the place is small and gets pretty full around dinner time. We started off with the buffalo cauliflower, amazing. The cauliflower tasted just like buffalo chicken nuggets, I was amazed. For our entree I got the chimichanga which again you couldn't tell was vegan but was stuffed with tofu, brown rice, and refried beans. The chimichanga was stopped with cashew cheese, all together it was the perfect combination. My friend got the Alfredo with broccoli, I was a huge fan of the consistency of the cheese sauce on it but it was still good. To finish the meal though full and satisfied we tried the carrot cake, the cake was delicious. The only thing I wished they did was had the cake warm. Definitely will come back I had an amazing experience and the staff is so friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have been here many times. It is so consistent. Great real food prepared well in very tasty ways. This and Luna's are the two best options for real local grown food that is great to eat. We are big fans of Fern. Give it a try a couple times and you will know why it is a great place to eat."}
{"text":"I was skeptical going in, thinking I'd need to stop for dinner on the way home.  The cucumber water is great, and very refreshing.  The Tribal Tacos, though not necessarily taco-ish in the traditional sense, we're delicious.  The OM burger, which I didn't have, is on my list of dishes to try soon, because it looked delicious and reportedly was.  The dessert was on another level.  The vegan chocolate cake was hands down one of the best cakes I've ever had, vegan or otherwise."}
{"text":"Amazing vegan place.  Presentation great Food taste great  Quality of food great Menu awesome  It's a must try for anyone coming to charlotte"}
{"text":"The brunch was delicious!  I had the nachos and my partner had the biscuits and gravy.  So much flavor!  Gorgeous decor and great service!  This is the place to take your friend who thinks vegetarian food is boring.  The tofu is excellent, they get it from a farm in Virginia and it is the opposite of negative tofu stereotypes- it is firm but not dry, moist and perfectly seasoned.  The $2 Bloody Mary rocked my world.  good prices all around.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Fern used to be a favorite of mine! The last time we went here , we realized the many was completely changed and the food tasted bland and not good at all. It is not at all worth the time, money or waiting for reservation.  Completely lost its charm and quality."}
{"text":"Fern isn't just for vegetarians or vegans - it's for anyone who enjoys food that is artfully prepared with a lot of flavor. My hubby and I are both meat-eaters, but we found Fern to be wonderful.   All of the portions were large and shareable, and my hubby and I shared several dishes:  1) Jalapeño poppers - 5/5 - They did not have fresh squash available because of a recent cold snap, so they offered this as a substitute. These weren't your average jalapeños, either. They were HUGE, spicy, and delicious. I was afraid I would not care for the vegan mozzarella or vegan ranch dressing, but both were outstanding. I hope they keep these on the menu for a spicy alternative to the squash!  2) Kale salad with fried goat cheese - 5/5 - This was my hubby's favorite dish. The kale was served warm, with a light beet dressing, raisins, beets, and two large pieces of fried goat cheese. I'm not a fan of goat cheese, but I enjoyed the kale very much.  3) Artichokes with spinach - 3/5 - One large artichoke was halved and filled with spinach and roasted garlic. The spinach was delicious, but the artichokes were just messy and too hard to eat. I would not get this again.  4) Indian tacos - 5/5 - This was my favorite dish. I was amazed at the flavor of these bean and squash tacos served on homemade fry bread, topped with red onions, lettuce, and cheddar (not the vegan variety).   5) Apple cider sangria - 3/5 - These beverages were tasty, but light on the alcohol and high on price. At $9 each, we wished we had skipped this part of our order.  The cucumber water you also get is quite delicious and I'll just stick with that the next time.  6) Beer doughnuts with chocolate sauce - 4/5 - These fried dough balls were tasty, but a bit dense. The flavors were very good, though, and we cleaned the plate.  My only complaint about the food was that the prices are a bit high, and things really add up fast. (Our meal was $76 plus tip. That's a bit much for a meatless meal.) But, we did get a lot and the quality WAS outstanding.  Service was also outstanding - very attentive and helpful.   The decor was extremely tasteful and inventive. I especially loved the light fixture made of mason jars, and the wall of live greens. Seating was a bit tight, though, and my chair was bumped several times by the servers and patrons. You definitely need reservations for a weekend dinner, because the dining area is very small.   All in all, it was a good experience, and we plan to return."}
{"text":"Fern is the type of restaurant that allows non-vegans to believe that they could become vegan.  The food and service are stellar. The Buffalo cauliflower is fabulous and addicting.  Our table enjoyed the burger, chimichanga and tuna melt (all prepared vegan).  The chimichanga was great but the star was the tuna which really tasted like the tuna many of us had given up years ago.  Easily the most elevated vegan cuisine in CHARLOTTE."}
{"text":"Loved, loved loved Fern.  The tacos are fantastic along with all their other food.  It is fresh and moving from the NY area is just as good as some of the restaurants up north."}
{"text":"Excellent choice for a plant based eater!  Cinnamon rolls for brunch were the perfect appetizer. Great outdoor seating, quaint indoor seating with a large share table.   We will definitely be frequenting FERN!  Please consider a satellite store in Fort Mill or Rock Hill!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my first time here. Had the Chicken Parmesan, Potato leek soup and buffalo cauliflower. Everything was awesome. I'll definitely be back probably just to get the same thing."}
{"text":"Delicious dinner, cute decor, and very nice wait staff. Our glasses were kept topped off with cucumber water the whole time we stayed. This was refreshing and felt luxurious. The butternut squash risotto was fantastic, and definitely the best thing anyone in our party ordered. The curry flatbread was pretty good too, and it came with a bowl of perfectly executed kale chips.  My husband ordered the shepherd's pie, and found it a little underwhelming, and not as much food as he hoped for. The chocolate peanut butter pie we got for desert was really good, though. If you prefer large quantity of food over quality, Fern might not be the best choice for you. But if you would like to eat at a restaurant with good flavors and healthy, fresh ingredients, and not feel gross when you're leaving, you will love Fern!"}
{"text":"I came here in search of new things and options as far as no meat, since I'm not a huge fan.  The restaurant is very small.  I was surprised how tiny the inside was.  They also have an outdoor patio space that would be nice for a cooler day.  The menu was simple and limited.  I tried a sample of the \"steak\" and potatoes, which was definitely different.  I was surprised at how much flavor the \"steak\" had.  I also tried the flatbread, which I didn't like too much.  Something about the flavor of the sauce that I didn't enjoy.  I liked the wonton appetizer a lot.  Very delicious!  The service was good.  Overall it wasn't bad and I would come back again to try some other menu items."}
{"text":"Ate here while visiting town. I was a little hesitant when our family told us we were going to a vegan restaurant for brunch. We were pleasantly surprised with the variety of the menu and the flavors. We got the breakfast nachos and they were very good. We got eggs with ours, so not vegan, but still light and healthy."}
{"text":"Pros: Pretty quick seating (even for Sunday brunch) Friendly staff Lots of vegetarian/vegan options Cool venue  Great coffee  Cons: Weird seating.. there's basically one long table in the middle of the restaurant, so you're right next to a stranger.  Takeaway: I am not a vegetarian, but there were so many great options that did not involve tofu. I really enjoyed my lemon meringue pancakes.   Would I go back? Even though I had a great experience, I would only go back if I was getting a meal with a vegetarian friend."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the menu and wish I could have ordered more than one dish! I will definitely be going back when I return to Charlotte. I had the pesto panini, which was filling and delicious. It was my first experience having the vegan chao \"cheese\" and I found it to be surprisingly cheese-like and delicious. We also tried the kombucha from Lenny Boy and an affordable beer ($5). I was full and satiated without hating myself at the end of the meal. Very pleased at the quality and ambiance as many \"vege/vegan\" places can be aggressive and off putting, but that was not the case here at all. Well done!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the service was great. The only negative aspect of my dining experience, the warm temperature inside the restaurant. But that won't stop me from visiting again."}
{"text":"The service as well as the lead manager Adam was horrible to me an the people dining.  We sat down and instead of welcoming us to Fern, he was abrasive and immediately stated \"we need this table in 20\" and left.  The couple next to us was appalled.  We love Something Classic and really respect The owner. We also understand sometimes the talent hired isn't a good as once thought. My family owns restaurants and service is everything   I have already shared our horrible experience and solely base this on our experience with the staff.  Friends have shared the same and will be posting and not returning"}
{"text":"YOU GUYS. I'm not vegan or vegetarian and I cannot remember the last time I've been so satisfied with a meal. Absolutely incredible. The buffalo cauliflower was PERFECTLY spicy and flavorful. Brussels were to die for. And OMG the black bean burger was perfection. -Also the butternut bisque was a flavor explosion. YOU MUST TRY THIS PLACE"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful restaurant!  The atmosphere and food is great.  We ordered the Brussel sprouts that were delicious.  My daughter ordered the Chimichanga and I ordered the Fettuccine with \"Chicken\" and they were both yummy!"}
{"text":"[i visited Fern in May, but just joined Yelp and am reviewing now]  My parents raised me vegetarian. Where my family is from in India, meat and eggs are not common (however we do drink milk and I eat cheese). With that said, I know good vegetarian food and this is not a place worth visiting for veggie fare.  I was very excited to go to Fern and hubby and I decided to go and treat a colleague. I ordered BBQ eggplant, which was basically raw and tough and barely cooked. The mac and cheese was weird in flavor and not in a good way -- it was sweet too which was not appealing.  My hubby ordered ramen and he said it had no flavor. The broth was so bland, he had to jack it up with hot sauce and salt to give it some flavor.   Our friend enjoyed his tempeh plank, so the night wasnt a total loss.  Its a pretty establishment, but for the price we paid we were greatly disappointed. Wont be going back, as there are other fabulous vegetarian restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Push past the camel colored drapes and enter into vegan paradise. A cheery hostess greeted us and quickly directed us to a quaint table by the window. Cool cucumber water was quickly poured into our glasses - its the little details like this that made our experience fantastic. My partner ordered the taco flatbread. Rojo sauce, soitan chorizo, onion, tomato, jalapeno and   vegan jack (you can order mozzarella instead,too) topped the flatbread. He paired it with crispy fingerling potatoes. Both were phenomenal - I particularly enjoyed the potatoes (it was quite a generous portion, too!) I had the OM burger, a white bean patty topped with smoked tomato, poblano garlic aioli and pickled cucumber between a potato roll (or collard leaf). I paired this with their side salad. Both of my selections were good - nothing to write home about, but enjoyable none the less. I was a bit disappointed with the quality of the tomato. It was mealy. It might be better to try this dish again when tomatoes are in season.  I always like a restaurant that politely slides in the the dessert menu - even though we did not order from it, I always enjoy checking out what their offerings are. I wish we had space to tempt our taste buds! They all looked delicious!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! I moved to Charlotte back in February when I was newly vegan and found that this place serves brunch every Saturday and Sunday. The cinnamon rolls are to die for(yes they're vegan:)) everything from the tofu scramble, chicken and waffles and biscuits and gravy are to die for. My boyfriend and I go every weekend and this past Saturday we were just a bit disappointed seeing that they changed the menu and also upped their prices by at least 3 dollars making some items 13 bucks. Like I said the food is absolutely delicious but instead of going every Saturday like we usually do we will now only be making it every other Saturday if that"}
{"text":"Mediterranean tofu scramble - warning: it has a lot of liquid from the tofu. It's more of an entree then a breakfast scramble. It seems like a basic toss with salt and pepper  Chicken and waffle - not crunchy! Soggy tofu with the \"crunch\" layer falling apart and off. The waffle was also very soggy.  OM burger - best of the three entrees but still not that great. The patty was falling apart and was again, very soggy. I loved the sesame bun though. It was crisp, soft and covered with sesame!   Sides: Kale chips - plain and simple oil with salt  Local vegetables - eggplant, sweet potato, onion and pepper."}
{"text":"Unique. Interesting. Quite good. As enjoyable as my experience at Fern was, I honestly believe you have to develop a taste for this food before you start truly enjoying it. It's not like other universally liked dishes such as pizzas, burritos or ice-cream! The food is truly unique, and healthy too. Where have you seen or tasted a drink made with beets, fennel, apples, cucumber and turmeric? Strange - yes, but not bad tasting. I also tried a beverage made with almond milk, vanilla and blueberries. They have enough items on their menu to intrigue me and make me want to go back for more. I had the OM burger, which kinda reminded me of a falafel because of it's fried texture. I'm definitely going back to try the indian tacos & squash blossom hush puppies, and will probably wash it down with their Violet bliss made from pomegranates, agave and lemonade.. yumm :)"}
{"text":"Fern is such a wonderful place to have in the area! I truly enjoy coming here.   Everyone is always so friendly and the environment welcoming and laid back. The staff is knowledgable and even helpful in the classic \"what do I choose between these two dishes\" dilemma.  It means a lot to be able to come to a restaurant knowing there are multiple options to choose from as a vegan with dishes that can make anyone go \" are you sure this is vegan?\" Buffalo cauliflower, \"Caesar\" wraps, pastas, pancakes...all I have had thus far has been good. Side note: Their weekend brunch menus are always so creative. Keep an eye on social media to see these pop up a couple of days before the weekend arrives to plan accordingly.  They have a generous cocktail selection, kombucha, and the traditional beers and wines. The seating can be limited, sometimes there is a wait, however if you time it correctly you can slide in there. Before the church crowd for brunch on a Sunday AM for example. The patio is sweet with ample extra seating which is good for when the weather is nice.   Everyone needs to grab a bite here! Not a vegan or vegetarian, that's okay, it will still be tasty and everyone can benefit from a vegan/vegetarian meal! Support this business as one of the few of its kind in the area."}
{"text":"Service was super friendly and the restaurant is lovely. I had the fried cauliflower, which was a bit oily, not crunchy, and the hot sauce base of the buffalo sauce was overwhelming. The togarashi tofu bowl only had one slice of tofu, but literally half the veggie mix was white onion, which totally overpowered any other flavors. I asked for hot sauce but they didn't have any. With some seasoning and content control the food would have been better."}
{"text":"Excellent.  We had a couple of appetizers and split an om burger and a Buddha bowl.  The meatballs were delicious, and they added seitan to give it a gristle texture. The green goddess soup was ginger carrot, delicious. The buddha bowl was awesome, the miso broth sauce was great. The om burger had a great texture and a delicious smoky flavor. For a vegetarian foodie, this is a great place to go. I got some inspiration for my own cooking."}
{"text":"Food is excellent if you are seeking vegan fare. But Living Kitchen in SouthEnd is close and the people are so much kinder! Don't expect to pop in at Fern. Reservations are mandatory and TIGHTLY followed. Manager Adam became VERY abrasive when things didn't go exactly according to his plan.   Our experience was horrific & certainly in direct opposition to the parent company, The Mother Earth Group's Mission Statement of \"Nurturing One Another, Our Community and The Earth.\"  Nurturing was not to be had. I was in the neighborhood on the way elsewhere to meet friends at 7 but stopped by Fern. I wanted to say hello to my friend & her friend for a quick drink at 6:22. Upon arrival I was told by 3 people, in a very abrupt manner, within a 5 minute span, the seat I was using from an open 2 top table behind me was for a reservation in about 20 minutes. I said I'd move when the reservation arrives as I'm just here for a drink. The entire area around us was empty. Another reservation for 12 was expected at a center table next to us at 7:15. When the 2 top came in, I quickly returned the seat. The customer was seated w/out issue. As I had an half glass of vino left, I took a chair from the 7:15 party of 12 table & moved to the other corner. This was more than poor uptight Adam the manager could handle. He said I was in some kind of fire exit path & I had to leave. I said I was leaving shortly. Again, I was not keeping anyone from sitting down for their reservation. My friend commented \"Hard to believe you are in the service industry\" and he quickly retorted he would ensure our name was blocked from ever making a reservation there again. We were shocked by the treatment we received collectively.  I completely appreciate someone having reservations & I honored the request to move. Yet I've never been somewhere and felt SO unwelcome as a customer. I want to chalk it up & believe Adam was having a bad day...or he was stressed anticipating his team wouldn't be able to handle a 12 top reservation or something else. But the stringent attitude he has doesn't bode well for managing the front end of a restaurant and dealing with people = customers = our Charlotte community. Sometimes plans don't always work out. Treating customers with grace in tn awkward or challenging time is what can make or break any business. Good luck to Mother Earth in getting Fern back on track and in line with their Mission Statement. With Adam at the helm, they will need it."}
{"text":"Amazing! We found this place while in Charlotte. Being a Vegan newbies we were a bit curious. Everything was wonderful and the atmosphere was very relaxing."}
{"text":"Clean. Vegan/vegetarian. Staple. Dreamy.   Every time I eat at fern I'm reminded why I continue to go back. Every. Single. Time.   The food is solid. Not many places can have a stellar breakfast, lunch, dinner And brunch menu, but Fern, they do!   You have to get the buffalo cauliflower bites. Don't even look at the menu when you sit down just say \"I want the cauliflower bites, please!\" Then take your time deciding between the light, yet filling salads and the vegan pho as your main course.   We often share plates. We order three things and nibble our way through the flavors and textures of these well thought out and paired plates.   If you're looking for an amazing brunch you can't go wrong with the nachos and the chocolate strawberry pancakes. Grab a seat on the patio, under the sun or the swaying barista lights and sip a coffee or mimosa while you indulge.   Fern is by far one of my top 5 favorites in Charlotte!!"}
{"text":"You know when you eat something and it tastes like happiness? That's Fern. Awesome, innovative menu with a vegan spin on classic like \"chicken bacon ranch\" sandwiches and falafel with \"tzasiki\" sauce. Highly, highly recommend. Also, I ordered takeout during a busy lunch hour and it took about 10 minutes tops."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the new location and the overall atmosphere. It's clean and the staff is usually professional.   The food is rather expensive, but worth it most of the time. The brunch is great and most of the dinner options are unique and change out seasonally. I like the variety and options to switch it up every time I go. Though I have had some misses, I usually leave very satisfied!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Been here for brunch, lunch and dinner. Service was impeccable & attentive. The cuisine is scrumptious. The patio is lovely, and the inside of the restaurant is light, airy, attractive, well thought-out and clean. There are more mainstream dishes on each of the menus (lunch, brunch & dinner) to satisfy non hardcore vegetarians, like a locally sourced cheese plate, with delicious homemade bread and jam (which I wish I could buy in a jar and take home), nuts and flatbread. Also- check the \"side items\" options at the bottom of the menu for protein add-ons like goats cheese, avocados, etc. You can tell that the staff are passionate about their food and have an interest in the restaurant doing well. Great place- I hope it stays in my neighborhood!  By the way- If the photo with avocado green walls & white chairs is still the first photo you see in the restaurant profile, be aware that the picture does not represent the newer location on East Blvd. That must be a picture of the old location. The new location has an earthy, airy vibe."}
{"text":"Had a meal with my dinner group here tonight, but have been here several times and am proud that Fern is in my neighborhood.  The cucumber water is refreshing, and I also enjoyed a nice fume blanc. I ordered the ginger fish and chips.  While I did not get a distinct ginger flavor, the tofu was delicious.  Several commented that the tofu looked like fish with its crispy breading.  The potatoes needed a smidge more flavor, but a little salt and pepper helped. I am never disappointed when I dine here.  Fern gives it a good go, and they consistently change the menu, becoming all the more creative.   At other restaurants, I have only a choice or two as a vegetarian. Here, I could order any entree and be well pleased."}
{"text":"Here's the thing...Fern does what they do quite well.  They have a great atmosphere that feels fresh and clean, modern and green (literally).  I can certainly appreciate a place that sources from local farmers, cooks \"clean,\" caters to vegan/vegetarian diners, and takes pride in their unique menu options.  Here's my opinion....they have some items that are excellent and well done for the vegan/vegetarian palate but they have other things that won't cut it even for the most adventurous grubber.  Their flatbread was pretty good with seitan and \"cheese.\"  I also liked their potato wedges.  They were basically really thick, hand-cut fries.  The homemade ketchup and hot sauce were kinda nasty and didn't quite do the trick for me.  I also made the mistake of trying (based on the waitress' suggestion) the \"squash fillet.\"  It looked like a piece of salmon that was laid on top of potatoes in a tomato \"Cream\" sauce.  The presentation was lovely but that's about as far as it went..The squash \"fillet\" was basically a hard piece of squash with zero flavor.  It was seriously gross.  I like spaghetti squash, butternut squash, zucchini squash but this fillet o squash that was posing like a salmon...not so much.  I like Fern but I don't love them.  I think Charlotte lacks solid restaurants for people with special or alternative diets and so everyone tends to rave about Fern but truthfully there are a lot of things they could improve upon.  The service is okay but I have been twice now and both times I felt a twinge of pretentiousness upon arrival.  It is almost like you have to prove to the staff and the other diners that you are hipster enough and trendy enough to eat at this exclusive \"club\" of a restaurant.  Lame.  Plus it is SO quiet in there that it is almost awkward.  They may consider playing a little music so you don't feel like you are intruding on someone's dinner party when you enter.  I also found the menu to be quite limiting.  I know they can't offer a diner-sized menu but there really weren't that many options in general and it didn't change much at all from the last time I was there which was over a year ago.  Does Fern stand out as one of the nicer dining option in Charlotte if you are a vegan/vegetarian..YES.  If they get some real competition are they going to be everyone's favorite?  I don't think so."}
{"text":"I loved my curry burger here. Its a bit pricey but if it was cheaper it would definitely be somewhere I would eat every week! 5 stars for food, but I had to give it 4 because of the price."}
{"text":"Not gonna lie, I don't dream about dining in veg-only restaurants often, or ever, but with a lunch date with my vegetarian sister on the books, I figured it was a good enough reason to try the place... I have to say I was very impressed.  We chose to sit outside and it was quite nice. The handful of iron chairs and wood-top tables scattered on wooden flooring made you forget you were yards from central avenue, until a train would come through. Lots of plant life, and they had a few heaters set up. We opted for the cucumber infused water (there were other bottled options) and started on the menu. We were give one which was simply drinks, the front half is freshly made juices and juice blends (all $6 - we opted for a lemonade/agave concoction) the back is beers and wines.   The food menu is the perfect length - just enough small plates, sandwiches, salads and entrees, with lots of daily changes (bruschetta, soup of the day, buddha bowl, cheese selections). They also have the items which are vegan or can be made vegan marked with little ferns, which I thought was clever. We couldn't pick, so we decided to split four of the small plates (but the table next to us had the OM burger and it looked amazing).  Squash blossom hush puppies - yummm. thank you kenny r. for the heads up. I wouldn't have known it was vegan cheese if it hadn't said so on the menu. So good, I didn't want to share. I enjoyed the onion \"butter\", my sister did not, luckily these pups stand perfectly well on their own.  The Indian Tacos - this, as a meat lover, was hands down my favorite dish. If I hadn't know any better I would have sworn up and down with the complex flavors they brought into the chili that I was eating something heartier than beans and squash. Mixed in with the lettuce and tomato and then sandwiched between a layer of the sharp cheddar on top and fried goodness underneath, holy crap, I'm sold.   The Envious Artichoke is the perfect light dish, stuffed with spinach and olives and topped with fried onions- we were very happy campers. On the other hand, the cannelloni added some serious weight to my stomach. Granted, it's a great fall flavor concoction of goat cheese goodness served over a sweet squash puree - but not the greatest choice for our fourth tasting dish.   Our service was top notch- water constantly filled, staff was very familiar with the menu, we were checked on just the right amount of times. Even though there isn't any meat on your menu, Fern, I'm a fan. (but seriously, get some new pens.)"}
{"text":"So, if I am being honest here, I was definitely hesitant on Fern.  I am not a meat lover, but do feel every meal must include a protein (chicken or fish).  And, of course the entire day, I wanted a hamburger.  Needless to say I joined my Dinner Group at Fern after checking out the menu, other Yelp reviews and photos.  From the menu I thought I could branch out and may be some of the Seitan options would really taste like meat. We arrived around 7:00 and I was able to observe the restaurant. Very simple, with a great setup and comfortable feel.  We decided to start with several appetizers:  Brussel Sprouts, Pimento Cheese Dip, Cauliflower, Noshes and Choizo and Cheese Dip.  The appetizers were all amazing. Great flavor, fresh and definitely great portion sizes to share with several.  I have to say the Brussel Spouts and Chorizo and Cheese Dip were my two favorites. The chorizo dip, served in a hot skillet, definitely did not taste vegan and had a great kick to it, with some peppers and corn, served with toasted bread.  As for the entrees, I wasn't as impressed as I was with the starters.  I chose the OM Burger, a white bean patty, with a side salad. First, the patty, too mushy. The waitress made it sound like it had a panko breaded crust, offering different textures, but it all appeared to be the same to me.  Just the same consistency with no real flavor, very bland.  The salad was a disappointment too, very blah.  The others enjoyed the bolognaise, black bean burger and chili rellanos.  Several people really didn't say too much about their entrees, while others enjoyed.  I think it was mixed bunch, especially after we all LOVED the appetizers.  Two of us decided to split the chocolate cake with peanut butter mouse. The cake was too hard, very dry, but that mousse...OMG.  I could eat it was a spoon out of a jar. It was smooth with an amazingly light peanut butter flavor.  I think Fern is definitely a great place to check out. I suggest enjoying a good beer or wine and having some appetizers, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the food is awesome!  HOWEVER the service is not good.  We have now been here 3 times and the same thing.  They seat you and then you don't see a server for awhile even though there is no one else in the restaurant and you are sitting there with the menus stacked and looking around.   There are not many vegan restaurant options in the Charlotte area so we will more than likely return."}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I went to Fern last night because he's got some food allergies and vegan is really the best way to go.   We got: roasted cauliflower, veggie latkes and the bruschetta for appetizers. Bruschetta was the best of the three followed by the cauliflower and the latkes. The cauliflower came with this pepper pistachio brittle and it was an amazing flavor combination. The pieces of brittle were big though so I had to break them up because I wanted a bit with each bite.   For dinner the boyfriend got the OM burger and I got the indian bread tacos. We were so full that we each only ate a little bit of dinner and took the rest home. Both were awesome at the time and we ate the rest for breakfast today. Still awesome.  Though we were completely stuffed, we got the chocolate coconut cake for dessert. Since the boyfriend is allergic to eggs, vegan desserts are always a toss up but you know what? It was moist, rich and amazing.   We'll be back for brunch soon!"}
{"text":"II had to give this spot a try as I am on my 5-6 day a week vegan quest. Started the night with a Three Sisters Cake appetizers, it was pretty good. For my main course I got the Mushroom Farro \"Risotto\" and it had some good flavors going on (Wild Mushroom & Tofu Ragu, Caramelized Fennel & Fennel Pollen,Toasted Walnut & Lucques Olive Tapenade) They also serve cucumber water and that was a nice touch. I also figured, what the hell, might as well try a dessert too! The Doughnut holes with chocolate stout sauce was awesome! I also left feeling like I had still had a healthy meal. The restaurant is pretty small and has a great atmosphere. The lighting fixtures (made from mason jars) are very cool and they have live ferns growing on a wall (hence the name). I will definitely come here again to try some other tasty vegan fare."}
{"text":"My wife made the decision to eliminate meat from her diet a few months ago. No beef, no pork, not even chicken or turkey. No shellfish, but fish including salmon and mahi mahi is still cool as are eggs and dairy. It's been an interesting time trying to eat around this new program, especially since my daughter and I are unrepentant flesh-craving carnivores.  For this week's family brunch, I offered to try a restaurant completely focused on vegan and vegetarian options. Fern hit the spot with great reviews and options that I felt would minimally inconvenience us meat eaters while giving my wife options other than salad.  As Mrs. K. is still figuring out vegan, I could see that the menu was a little complicated. So while we studied it, I got us started with coffee (with almond milk. Stevia and Sugar-in-the-raw on the table) and the cinnamon rolls. The rolls arrived and we were able to place our brunch order. Tasty and doughy, not too sweet at all. Yum.  Sausage and gravy for my wife, Mediterranean scramble for daughter and the zucchini/spinach benedict for me. It was clear by what was left when we asked for the check who had enjoyed their meal most thoroughly. It was me - my plate was clear. The zucchini fritters were tender and moist, sort of like a crab cake except without crab. Topped with steamed spinach, poached eggs and hollandaise, really tasty. I'd recommend it thoroughly.  The scramble wasn't that great, according to daughter. Rather bland, she said. And she didn't care for the quinoa. Oh well. Mrs said that the biscuits were too cakey but the gravy was good.  For sides, I had the crispy braised fingerling potatoes. It was as close to home fries as you're going to get and they were perfectly crunchy and salty. The sweet potatoes were good (tender and sweet), but not the best choice for their brunch meals.  Service was excellent. The coffee was great. And the price was pretty decent.  I don't know that we'd return for brunch, but only because it's challenging for the carnivores. Maybe lunch or dinner next time. That said, you herbivores would love this place."}
{"text":"Updated review: I was really hoping to be pleasantly surprised with my second visit.  I got the spaghetti and \"meatballs\" to go. Even though I called a half hour prior to my pick up, it was not ready and I was told it was accidentally given to somebody else (I understand that accidents can happen.) It was beautifully presented and the flavors of the sauce and white bean and eggplant \"meat balls\" were wonderful! I also loved the texture of the meatballs rather than frozen TVP. The drawback is that the meatballs were not heated through even though I ate one within five minutes of it being handed to me. I'd like to say that perhaps they hurried my order and maybe took it out before final temp (but it was not 145° F for sure.)  I also am used to zucchini noodles being the texture of spaghetti noodles, but instead they were the texture of spaghetti cooked for approximately five minutes versus eight or nine and too crunchy yet (again, maybe they hurried my order because of the earlier mistake?)    I actually wanted to come back earlier to retry the place, but the man that answers the phone lacks professionalism and courtesy. There is no please or thank you and his customer service skills are lacking based on his cold responses to my simple questions about specials of the day. It really made me not want to go back, but I did since I really wanted to give this place a better review (because the manager reached out to me and because I like to support vegan restaurants).  Also, note that at both visits the man that gave me my order was extremely nice and very cordial (not the same person that answers the phone.) So this will end my visits to Fern, and my final rating for them is average, but I surely wouldn't want to deter someone else from trying it."}
{"text":"There is something here for everyone and you won't even miss not having meat in your course. The BBQ cauliflower was awesome, it's listed as an appetizer but could definitely be an entree. I had the Mushroom Filet for my main course and it was really good, I really enjoyed the sauce on the mushroom. The asparagus was cooked perfect and the veg hash was good as well.  A few weeks prior to coming I looked over the menu and wanted to try a few different things but found out that was the winter menu and that the spring menu just started. So I will definitely be back to try all of their different menus. They change it 4 times a year!"}
{"text":"Fern exhibited the three things most important to me in a restaurant: Excellent and interesting cuisine, attentive and knowledgeable staff and a unique atmosphere.    Small and cozy, Fern's nature inspired interior was welcoming right off the bat.  Each table was adorned with a little mason jar terrarium and artful silver, making this a really neat date spot.  We started with the Fern Bruschetta, which is the only thing I wouldn't recommend due to the sogginess of the bread.  But their local kombucha followed it up nicely.  The main courses were fantastic.  The Arugula and Smoked Trumpet Mushroom salad was by far the most interesting and enjoyable salad I've yet had.  When I asked the server about the mushrooms, she was very knowledgeable and friendly, and all of the staff seemed to have a genuine interest in the menu items and their ingredients.  The OM Burger, as many others have said, was also delectable.  The crisp, light bun made it for me, and the flavor was great.  I'd definitely recommend Fern, it was perfect for a lunch date and worth every penny."}
{"text":"Very pleasant place and a little romantic too. I got Berries lemonade and Om burger yam yam good.i recommend this place"}
{"text":"If you are a vegetarian you will love this place. If you're not, you will be impressed with how amazing vegetarian cuisine can be. My wife and I ate there last night and had an excellent meal. The Buffalo cauliflower was unbelievable as an appetizer - as were the wontons. We split a strawberry and fig dinner salad and the chimichanga - both were also delicious. The one thing I didn't really love was dessert (lemon cheesecake), but otherwise everything was tremendous.   I have to mention how great the service was as well - very attentive, helpful, and courteous. We will be back often."}
{"text":"Best Vegan/vegetarian food in Charlotte!! Loved the OM Burger, Mac and Cheese, and the Green Banana Smoothie. Definitely going back. I suggest car pool because their parking lot has about 8 spaces."}
{"text":"I came in to eat on Saturday August 5th to treat myself for my birthday. The food was so good! I had never been to Fern before. My server, I wish I knew her name she was so knowledgeable and so friendly and helpful. But I had the raw tacos and it was so good! Very flavorful and fresh. I had a sangria to go with it very refreshed and crisp and she recommended the carrot cake which is actually my favorite dessert and it was to die for! I will definitely be back to see them again it was a great experience and I'm slowly trying to cut meat out of my life so this will definitely be a restaurant with visit very often."}
{"text":"We had the pleasure of enjoying a family dinner at Fern. My sister flew in from NYC and we always look for vegetarian options for her. So Fern was on our list. We got there around 7PM an were able to be seated immediately. We ordered up some Sangria, appetizers, and entrees.   The Sangria of the night was tasty, the Budha Bowl special was bland, the beet tagliatelle with figs also bland, the rustic potato dish with veggies...bland, but the veggie burger and appetizer platter was a success!!!   The burger is huge! So share it. The cucumber yogurt sauce, save some of that to put on your burger as well. The hummus, de-lish. Can't remember what else we ordered... but it, too was yummy.   Overall the food was bland but the burger and appetizers were a hit. The restaurant itself, is really cute and comfortable. I'm sure we'd go back for a visit without my sister..."}
{"text":"I came with a group of friends on a week night. We started with the buffalo Cauliflower and Brussel Sprouts. Both were amazing. I tried the pork cutlet, the chimichanga, and the chicken sandwich. Literally EVERYTHING was good. It was flavorful, the right temperature, and the best part - guilt free. We finished the night with a chocolate torte dessert which was a cashew custard. This was amazing as well. Your server can answer any questions, but you seriously can't go wrong with any choice."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this restaurant when it was at its previous location so it's been a while. The dishes are mostly vegan which I love. I had the buffalo cauliflower appetizer and the squash filet entree. The cauliflower appetizer serving was huge so I had lots to take home. I really liked it but I have to be honest & say I like California Pizza Kitchen's version better. The squash file was an acorn filet very thickly sliced with some sauce over it. The flavor was bland & unimpressive. At a price of $17 I was not surprisingly disappointed because Vegan food can be flavorful & tasty.  Several of the items on the menu were imitation meat meals like tofu \"pork chops\". I don't like the flavor of meat so I wish they would focus on showing how vegan meals can be delicious in their own right using complex blends of spices & vegetables.  Hopefully Fern will continue to improve their recipes."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegan or a vegetarian but I was really impressed with the food and innovation at Fern. The beet appetizer literally looked like seared tuna and tasted not far from it. The Buddha Bowl was also great and probably one of the more filling items on the menu. If you have a sweet tooth, the beignets are incredible!"}
{"text":"If you are vegetarian or vegan Fern is an excellent choice for a good place to eat.  My wife is vegan, so I've eaten at Fern several times with her.  Even though I'm not vegetarian I've always been pleasantly surprised at the variety and quality of food served at Fern.  Some of their dishes are quite unique and make it worth eating at Fern."}
{"text":"Fern is a veggie lovers dream!  I had heard some amazing reviews, and I seriously would go back weekly if I could to try every dish if I could afford it.  The flavors are incredibly fresh and inventive.  I've been a foodie in quite a few different cities and hadn't quite found a to die for restaurant in charlotte until I came here.  The staff and service was also excellent.  Def will be back, and not just for the mimosas!"}
{"text":"Fantastic flavor! My husband and I shared the black bean burger and breakfast sandwich. We were blown away by the flavor and the coconut bacon was out of this world! Yum!!!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed the Rueben and chicken bacon ranch. Our waitress Victoria was very informative and welcoming. I will defintely come back again!"}
{"text":"Today I was able to make my way over to Fern with a meat eating friend, him agreeing to try it somewhat begrudgingly. As we thought it opened at nine, we arrived about an hour early for brunch. We decided to enjoy the weather and sit and chat, and after doing so for awhile, Chef Matt came out and spoke to us. He was kind, inviting, and very gently told us they opened in an hour. Once we entered, we decided on the selection of muffins with jams and butter to start with, but were surprised to be brought out both cinnamon rolls and muffins! Chef Matt kindly treated us to the cinnamon rolls for waiting- and what a treat- those cinnamon rolls were the best part of the meal! Creamy, well spiced, and with a hint of citrus, I couldn't believe they were vegan! The muffins were excellent as well, and were followed by Patas Bravas with a great spicy sauce (add avocado, it's worth it)! Fern has quickly become my new favorite Charlotte restaurant, and my meat eating friend agreed! The staff was attentive and excited, which was just a cherry on top of the excellent meal! They even packed the muffins and extra cinnamon rolls, with extras of all the spreads! Great attention to detail. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I've dined here twice now - excellent food, great service and it seems to offer a menu that isn't common in Charlotte.  I will definitely be a repeat customer and recommend to friends."}
{"text":"The absolute best restaurant in charlotte, vegan/vegetarian or otherwise. Everything I've gotten has been amazing. Fresh, delicious, and unique. Great prices and plenty of food. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Meh, honestly nothing too special. I think vegan/vegetarian food can be so incredibly creative, delicious and fresh, but honestly that didn't came through here. We ordered two entrees (butternut risotto and spaghetti and meatballs), and they were OK, the spaghetti was probably a tad yummier and flavorful. The risotto was simply boring. The dessert was actually really delicious (turtle cake), a peanut butter ice cream with a vegan chocolate cake. The meal was ok, but probably the service didn't help either. The waiter was very uninterested in us being there... And almost got off the feeling that he was doing us a favor. I personally tried to engage him, and be nice, but nothing. Maybe he was just having a bad day? Overall... OK but, personally, think could be so much better..."}
{"text":"I came here for Brunch on a Saturday while visiting the city for a quick weekend away.  The food is good enough, not great.  If you're a vegetarian, you'll probably love it and think that it's the best thing in the world.  I enjoy the nice patio setting that even though, it's next to a small parking lot and a busy street, it's designed and enclosed in such a way that you don't feel as though you're in that environment.  Do be advised that during spring, a lot of things seem to to be dropping from the trees and the server even warned to sit in a certain outdoor section under a nice tree as it's a \"bird\" zone.  There's a small but diverse selection of craft brews that should at least satisfy most taste buds.  During brunch, as I came for, there's a mimosa option as well.  The menu has all the essentials from pancakes to egg dishes and chicken and bacon substitutes.  I tried the Chick'n Bac'n Ranch sandwich and it was pretty good.  The chicken substitute was nice but the bacon one actually wasn't there now that I think of it, or it was so neutral that I just couldn't tell that there was another flavor there *shrugs*.  The greens and tomato were fresh.  The breakfast potatoes were a stand-out though.  They were quite tasty.  This is a cute restaurant to pop into.  If you live in the area, it's worth a try. I'd come back if I were a local to try other dishes as well."}
{"text":"Curry Burger was amazing.  Plenty of healthy options to keep your energy high; post lunch.  I'll be back and will recommend to others."}
{"text":"I've always LOVED the food at Fern.  I had dinner here about a month ago.  My date had celiac's disease and can only eat gluten free. She ordered What the chef recommended which was completely gluten-free. About 20 minutes into the dinner she had to run to the bathroom and got really sick. The kind of sick that when's there's gluten in her food. (It ruined her weekend to say the least)  So, i told the server what'd happened and she said \"oh I'm so sorry, shall I bring the bill?\" So I paid and ran to get the car.  In my personal opinion there shouldn't have been a bill, or at least part of it. This is bad business, especially at a health conscious restaurant.   Sorry guys, this situation and the cold attitude I and other friends have always gotten from a manager type (Guy with a beard and glasses?) has kept me from going back ?"}
