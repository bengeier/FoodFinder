{"text":"This was my first visit to 40 West Steakhouse. My impression upon entering the restaurant was that Montreal has finally found its place among some of the better-known steak establishments in the U.S. We were greeted by an attractive group of hostesses and were seated in a prompt and courteous manner.   One small aside: the presence of a large flat-screen TV diminishes the authentic steakhouse ambience, turning it instead to a sports bar.  All in all, although a bit pricey, I would come back to 40 Westt again."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. The atmosphere was great. Not as crowded as I expected. The wine list is extensive. Our waiter was the best.   Would certainly go back."}
{"text":"Hubby took us for our anniversary - very romantic. Service was amazing & the steak .... Out of this world! We kept it simple oysters to star & then our steaks. Will go back."}
{"text":"The majestic decor and excellent service made me feel like a king as soon as I sat down for my meal. Best steak in Montreal. The appetizers and sides are also very well presented and absolutely delicious. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"There are a lot of places in Montreal that are pretty proud of themselves and charge alot of $ for you to have the honor of visiting their establishment. This is one of those places. The prices are high and the location is in a strip mall but that is all that I can complain about regarding this steakhouse. If you are looking for steak or seafood and are more interested in a modern ambiance than the Vieux Montreal scene, then this place should be on your list. Portions sizes are with \"Vegas\" style opulence. Big and juicy! I am not one that is \"looking to be seen\" in order to enjoy a night out but this place delivers the goods when it comes to freshness, presentation and taste. Looking to treat yourself and the misses? Can't go wrong here..."}
{"text":"Great steak house, totally recommended! The service is really good ask for Etienne,  He is a doer !!!"}
{"text":"Great lunch, everything was of the best quality, ambiance was great and the service was excellent"}
{"text":"The ambience the decor and the food are great , a luxurious huge place to dine ,  they have a big variety of dishes of fish not only steaks not to mention the huge plates that taste delicious  and the variety of entrees and salad and dessert ,, I really recommend this place and this experience . Pricey but good"}
{"text":"Food was good although very pricey. Service was uptight and not so good. We ordered a bottle of wine which was full of cork. Instead of changing the bottle the waiter had to filter each of our glasses 3 times.... And I never saw the \"live band\" they announce when we made the reservation..."}
{"text":"Love this place first class always reasonably price great quality live bands in the bar also excellent."}
{"text":"The steak house in the west island.  Great steak cuts (cowboy sirloin, baseball filet, delmonico...), well aged, classically prepared. Irreproachable service, and while not exactly affordable, not expensive either compared to downtown steaks. Add to that great seafood, easy parking, no wait and live jazz music on week ends makes this restaurant one of my favorite."}
{"text":"This place is the best steak house ever. I went there for my boyfriend work xmas party and we had an amazing time. You know the place will be nice the second you drive in the parking lot. I was not disappointed when I walked in. The place was clean, fancy and the idea of a coach check is great like that you don't  have people's coat all hanging at the back of the chairs. We were a really big group and the while night the service was beyond anything I have seen before. My glass of wine was never empty and anything we needed we received service for right away. I had the filet mignon and the cook was perfect and the plate tasted as good as it looked. They had a special menu prepared for our party so I didn't get to see the whole menu. The soufflé with the vanilla ice was better than anything I have tasted before. Everything was perfect from the second I walked in until  I left. I cannot wait to go back"}
{"text":"Looking for a great steak? Then I would definitely recommend this place! They are perfectly seasoned and cooked just the way you like it.  Not a meat fan? They make a really good cedar planked salmon."}
{"text":"What a beautiful restaurant, the building is fancy and provides a unique dining experience. The service was great I spoke with over 5 different people to help ensure my meal was great. I had oysters, cesar salad and the 20 oz cowboy cut steak with garlic mashed potatoes and the apple crumble desert. The salad was okay, a little too much anchovy flavour would of liked lemon and bacon. The steak was good, the piece of meat looked amazing. It was good quite charred, which adds a different flavour if you don't like that I would be hesitant to order a steak. Great customer service, beautiful restaurant."}
{"text":"Poor performance...very poor.  Started with the hostess asking me whom I was waiting for and who was that person to me...heuuu...  We took numerous entrees.   Abort the octopus, rubbery, did not smell right. Scallops not as advertised on the menu, tiny at best and uninspired drowned in a reduction of God knows what. Tuna tartare saved the day.  Beef spring rolls with very little beef in them. Sausisse Maison Grillés (we did not even finish them), foie gras pêche caramélisée & tuna was very good. Other entrees we took also average. Soufflé au chocolat, average...price not so average. Better deal somewhere else."}
{"text":"I don't understand how a steak restaurant can't cook steak properly.  Medium rare showed up at the table as medium well.  The cowboy cut is a significant piece of meat to screw up for the lunch rush.  It's too bad because it was well seared and the flavour was quite good.  I did make a point to express my dissatisfaction and a replacement piece of meat was offered which was an expected gesture.  Was it as good as the original?  No.  But at least it was cooked as requested.    We ordered a dozen oysters.  Malpeques aren't a premium oyster but cost $51 for a dozen.  That's just really overpriced.  They weren't even well-shucked.  Some had pieces of broken shell in them.  They were also completely inconsistent in size.    As for the other items we tried: spinach was pretty average and the fries were probably the worst I've had in awhile.  We requested a pasta for a child and it was fine.  Nothing fancy.  Surprisingly, an order of crab was the best part even though some pieces were definitely better tasting than the others.    I know for a fact there was an event happening in the back section of the restaurant.  Could this have been a reason why the food wasn't up to snuff?  Possibly.    It seemed like this place is doing well with the business lunch crowd.  Expense accounts must be the norm.  Given the four star rating on Yelp, I was actually quite excited to try this place but I wasn't impressed at all.    Bottom line: inconsistent food, service, and prices.  I would not return and would not recommend."}
{"text":"Legit steakhouse. Fine dining at its best right here!   The interior is absolutely stunning... High ceilings, chandeliers, open kitchen...Prepare to be blown away!  Came for a business dinner and we started with the raw seafood tower consisting of oysters, shrimp, lobster tails/claws and crab claws. It was all so incredibly fresh!  At a place like this, you NEED to order a steak. That's what they're known for! I ordered the 8 oz. filet mignon with melted brie and it was phenomenal - excellent cut, nice and tender, cooked perfectly, with the perfect compliment of the melted Brie on top.   Whether you order the side of garlic mashed potatoes, French fries with the aioli sauce, or garlic spinach, neither will disappoint. Each side was amazingly delicious!  Although they did have a complimentary wine list to pair with your steak, I would've like to see a speciality cocktail menu. That's about the only change I'd make to this fine establishment!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've eaten here and both times were for work functions. It's an amazing place, great decorations and well planned out. There were 26 of us and we were in the middle of the restaurant but it still felt like we had our own little section away from everyone else. There were other parties going on but they were all separated very well. The food and service were excellent as well as attention to detail. The only thing I didn't like was that we ordered 4 bottles of wine at $130 each and said we'll see how we do with those first. The server said don't worry he has this. Any way later on in the evening when we asked about the wine he said no problem and had been opening new bottles as they ran out. We had 10 bottles of red in total as well as multiple bottles of white which we would probably not have ordered as much if we were asked first. I've always been used to the server asking before opening a new bottle. So please beware and make sure the server understand exactly what you want. Our drinks bill alone came to over $2000 because of this, I was quite upset about this.   Other than this it was a great evening, and everyone enjoyed their meals from start to finish."}
{"text":"From the moment we walked in to the desert it was fantastic. Great service, knowledgeable staff, very accommodating ., and perfectly cooked steak. We've been to quite a few places in Montreal and this is definitely one of the best. The place is big , lots of space , nice bar, great choice of wines . I would definitely return and recommend to others . Don't let the price scare you they have many special throughout the week which make it very competitive."}
{"text":"A group of 20 of us went here to celebrate my 40th birthday.......food a+++++ service a+++++."}
{"text":"Love the bar side with live band. Great ambiance, very good food and attentive service. A little pricey, but definitely in the steakhouses standards. My wife loves this place for date night."}
{"text":"I've been there just 1 time but I will never go there! The quality of food was very good but the service was the worse service that I have ever experienced in restaurant.In addition the presentation of the food was not good too !"}
{"text":"I was debating over 3 or 4 stars.   it has very nice decor, and split into two eating areas.  The main dining room and the bar area.   It is a little pricy however the service is excellent, many servers to pay attention to you.  A good place to go if you plan on a longer evening out to have time to talk with your guest(s).   I had the 8oz filet and it was cooked just the way i wanted it along with a side of mash.  Everything was good.  I didnt have room for desert, however looking at the presentation tray. they looked amazing."}
{"text":"High class restaurant with high quality food! The best deal in the menu is the 40 for $40 you'll get a salad, steak and dessert. The salad was good, the steak was great (although small about a 6oz) but the dessert was the best! The chocolate soufflé is one of the best I have ever had. Again a small portion but packed with big flavor! Soooo creamy and fluffy. Every. Single. Bite."}
{"text":"Was invited to a company sponsored dinner at the 40W and enjoyed the 5 star experience. Service is excellent, ambiance is great and food was very good. Mind you, this was an all expenses paid dinner and they ordered med to high end dishes for everyone and I'm sure it wasn't a small tab at the end. Entrées were great and the presentation and plating is very well done. The staff are very friendly and professional.  Desserts were great too. Nice venue and decor as well."}
{"text":"What a great experience. Great service, great food, great ambiance. I have been here a few times in the past, but it seems to be getting better with time. I believe they have figured out what premium dining is all about. Was here for a work dinner and all where pleased. The winning plate was the cowboy steak which was encouraged by the waiter. He nailed it. Delicious when ordered medium rare. I recommend this to everyone to try. If you are staying on this side of town, it is worth the trip.  Get the apple crisp! The vanilla bean ice cream rocked. It!"}
{"text":"Fantastic steak, medium rare- perfectly cooked!   Garlic mashed potatoes with fantastic flavor.   Chocolate souffle to die for.  Spot on service.  The owner and staff were very friendly and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"I went to 40 Westt yesterday evening and thought it was a great steakhouse. Several people put forth extra effort to ensure things were just right."}
{"text":"American girl, but Canadian at heart. This place is a fun hangout. Live jazz Thursday to Saturday. It's a great place to take a date, or to  hang out with friends. Food is great -- plenty of fresh seafood and full bar. (:"}
{"text":"I've only been here for lunch so far and it's always been great. You cannot beat 3 courses at under $35 including great steaks and fish. The service staff are knowledgeable, attentive and friendly and I always leave full. One of the best lunch spots on the west island. I will be going back in the evening soon to try the regular menu and listen to some Jazz. Great spot !"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant but sit in the bar to listen to the wonderful trio and singer.  They make a very big deal about the quality of the meat and how they prepare it however on multiple occasions I have found my steak to be over-cooked. This is unacceptable given the extremely high prices. For me, the Keg is a better bet for steak."}
{"text":"I made my first visit to 40 Westt for my cousin's wedding. Being not from Montreal, I was not previously familiar with 40 Westt, but was curious to see how a wedding would function at a steak house. I was definitely pleasantly surprised. I actually think the food was way better than I've ever had for a large scale event. The seating was slightly tight but it was very well done. The ceremony set-up was quite beautiful. So while I can't comment on what it would be like for a normal dinner, it seems like a really upscale place. The lounge area is also really nice, although I missed most of the cocktail hour. The only thing I don't really understand is the location but I guess it works for the rich families living more in the suburban areas of montreal."}
{"text":"One of my family's favourite lunch places to go to. The inside of the restaurant is very spacious with very high ceilings. Their set menus for lunch includes an appetizer, a main course, and a dessert with coffee or tea. For appetizer, I usually like to get the wedge lettuce salad with blue cheese sauce. Their ahi tuna or filet mignon are good options for mains. And the chocolate soufflé with ice cream is a must for dessert!"}
{"text":"The service here is always excellent. I'm surprised that nobody has posted a picture of the Ahi Tuna. It's absolutely to die for. I've never felt sad for finishing a plate before I tried 40Westt's sesame crusted ahi tuna. Oh and that rice cake! Such a perfect dish, I'll for sure keep going there. The manager always makes sure that we are being treated like royalty and is really friendly! I can't wait to go back there. Currently my favourite restaurant in Montreal."}
{"text":"Great steak. The seafood platter was really fresh too.  It's amazing how fresh the food is.  I really enjoyed my dinner here...check it out, for sure!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Montreal, even if it's on the west island.  We came here as a group after a very long week dealing with our local colleagues.  There were seven of us and the bill ended up being over $1200.  Many bottles of wine. I had the rack of lamb (mmm....baby animals...) and it was excellent.  My favorite item was the grilled octopus, it was the best octopus I have ever had and I eat so much seafood that when I leave fingerprints anywhere there's a ring of mercury."}
{"text":"Had my office department Christmas party at 40 Westt.  I ordered the Tartatin as an appetizer and it was really tasty especially the choice of goat cheese and the way the sun-dried were marinated.  I ordered the veal as my main dish and the veal was really evenly cooked and not dry like that of a colleague the accompanying potato crepes were devine.   Then I had the chocolate soufflé for desert which was decadent.  All in all the food was superb."}
{"text":"Very impressive decor,  as soon as you walk in you see the luxurious decor,  on your right you have the bar area,  on the left you see the raw bar , the butcher shop and the open concept kitchen all done in a very classy way. The service is exceptional and the food is very good. We started with a villagio salad(tomatoes, crouton, feta chesse, olives), a plate of grilled Octopus and a plate of seared scallops. For the main course i took the filet mignon with a side of spinach. Every item was perfectly cooked and very tasty."}
{"text":"Boy did I luck out!  I had just flown in with my girlfriend from Las Vegas, and my uncle left a company party at 40 Westt to come pick me up.  When he asked if we were hungry, he threw us in the car and brought us back to meet his coworkers.  We were just in time to order our meals, and what followed was a wonderful four course meal.  First we each had an appetizer... mine was some sort of seafood plate including shrimp, octopus, and calamari.  My girlfriend's plate was tuna tar tar.  Next up was an insalata caprese salad, which was one of the best I've ever had.  The main course was next, in which we both enjoyed a nice big filet mignon.  The sides were to share for the table, and we sampled the mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach.  The french fries were outstanding, though, but I think that's just cuz fries are good EVERYWHERE in Montreal.  After that, we found room for the dessert trio they put in front of us, which had a lemon cake (good), some ice cream (better), and some sort of chocolate lava cake (best, delicious, and any other positive adjectives you can think of).  Throughout our meal we enjoyed a jazz band that did decent covers of current songs, too.  Atmosphere was good, service was good, and food was outstanding.  Here's to more good meals while visiting Montreal..."}
{"text":"A Very nice place. The service was outstanding. I ordered the tuna and fois gras, the fois gras was so tasty! The lobster bisque is a little bit bitter side, not quite sure about it. The filet mignon \"creme brûlée \" was basically filet wrapped with bacon and topped with Brie or goat cheese served with sautéed mushrooms and a choice of side. Must try their special chocolate soufflé, it is different from the conventional ones. It Is more creamy and has more depth of flavour. You must try it."}
{"text":"Rendez-vous au 40 Westt pour fêter les 75 ans de papa. Attention, le restaurant est difficile d'accès, caché en arrière du Bar B Barn. Nous avions réservé pour 6 et étions assis du côté bistro/bar.   L'accueil était bien, les hôtesses sont bien mises et classes.   Samedi soir, la clientèle est jeune, hip, aisée ($). Le restaurant semble être fréquenté pas des habitués. Look simple et branché.  Nous avons chacun pris une entrée et tout le monde était satisfait. J'ai opté pour les pétoncles à l'érable, un pur délice, cuites à la perfection. Comme plat principal, rib steak. Beaucoup de gras mais je ne crois aps que ce soit la faute du restaurant mais plutôt la coupe de viande que j'ai choisi. La cuisson médium était, là encore, à la perfection. Les frites accompagnées d'une sauce aïoli, sublime.   Le service, EXCELLENT. Enfin, je ne dirais pas le service mais plutôt, le serveur. Il se peut que d'autres aient une autre expérience au même restaurant tout simplement parce qu'ils sont tombés sur un mauvais serveur. Il était très présent sans être envahissant. Un service, honnête et sincère. Un serveur qui aime son travail et pas seulement le pourboire qui y est rattaché. Pourtant, il avait PLUSIEURS tables à sa charge. Une perle rare.  Nous avons tous choisi des coupes différentes, rib steak, filet mignon, cotelettes de veau. Tout le monde a adoré.   Le dessert, soufflé au chocolat avec crême glace (dans le menu prix fixe pour 2), crême brûlée avec petits fruits, crême brûlée au cappuccino et croustade aux pommes. TOUS PARFAITS.   De plus, tout au long du repas, groupe jazz omniprésent. Ajout parfait à l'ambaince du repas.   Coût: Dispendieux. Dire que la facture est salée serait un point négatif alors que je n'ai rien de négatif à dire sur ce souper, alors j'opte pour dispendieux. Avec une bouteille de vin, quelques centaines. Le repas prix fixe pour 2 est une bonne option. Idéal pour un anniversaire ou une occasion spéciale.  J'y retourne, mais mes attentes côté service seront grandes."}
{"text":"A good place to celebrate special occasions. Very classy steakhouse with a price tag that goes along with it. Good alternative to queue de cheval if you don't want to go all the way downtown"}
{"text":"We went here for a lunch with the company I used to work for. I heard great things about it and they delivered!  Started off with a light dish, cucumber cut to look like spaghetti with other seasonal produce lightly dressed with a Parmesan crisp on it.  I had the duck and it was delicious, someone on the table had a veal lover but complained it was too over cooked. The waiter rectify the situation brought another one and a bottle of Porto on the house.. Great service!  The desert were different variation, I recall a chocolate soufflé I could be wrong though. Anyway give this place a try. It can get expensive but it's worth it."}
{"text":"A fantastic steakhouse!  I had the filet mignon brulé and was blown away.  The service was impeccable and the ambiance was classy, but not too formal.  I highly recommend checking this out if you are in the area"}
{"text":"A must visit establishment in the Point Claire area of Montreal. Food is always cooked to perfection and the wine list is amazing!"}
{"text":"The service and food is always delicious. It is very pricey but the portions and meat grade is worth the money you spend. It's a nice spot for a night out with your loved one or a special occasion."}
{"text":"This is the second time that I have been here in 4 weeks and I will not go back anytime soon, the service was average, the quality of the food was poor and the value non existant, so many better steakhouses in town --very disappointing especially after all the hype"}
{"text":"Best restaurant in the West Island by far. It's great for big groups, small groups and even one on one. The food is always amazing. The service is top. The atmosphere is warm and elegant. Wonderful choices of wine. A must try."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant with unbelievable service. The atmosphere and the attention to detail makes it worth visiting.  It is on the pricier side so most will want to go for a special occasion.  If you want to make it more of an evening out and an experience I suggest you eat in the lounge bar.  There is live jazz music.  Thankfully it wasn't too loud and we were still able to talk. I am sure we will be back again."}
{"text":"40 Westt tends to attract a more local crowd rather than tourists, given its location just off of Highway 40 in the West Island of Montreal (hence the name, 40 Westt).  With a fresh and lively ambience, live jazz Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights, 40 Westt is definitely a fun place to meet for a romantic dinner for two, or to meet up with a few friends.  The food is outstanding, with a large variety of fresh fish and other varieties of seafood and plenty of different cuts of meats.  Can't decide what to order? Split a few appetizers among friends; most are big enough to share.  With a full service bar and some great choices for dessert, 40 Westt is also a great little hangout for a cocktail and dessert around 10 or 11 o'clock.  My review can't do this restaurant the justice it deserves; you must definitely check out their website www.40westt.com"}
