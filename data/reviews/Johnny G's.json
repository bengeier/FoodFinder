{"text":"Standard breakfast.  Awesome woman who gave the homeless free coffee.  Overall, great laid-back place to eat breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"This place rocks!!   $6.99 plus tax for the big breakfast including coffee (free refills) and orange juice.  If you like fancy this place might not be for you.   However if you like comfortable, friendly, and  great value then give it a try. I've never had a problem with anything I have eaten here it all has tasted great.   The waitresses are fabulous it is obvious they give a pancake about good service!"}
{"text":"This place is dreadful! Yes it's cheap but the coffee is flavourless (it's just water with brown) and the food is bland. I order the Eggs Benedict and it tasted like fish. For real. It was so gross, I had to send it back. I've only ever sent food back twice in a restaurant."}
{"text":"How can this place have good reviews? I went here twice to make sure if I am missing anything. But two bad breakfast is good enough for me to stop going here.  It definitely has cheap breakfast but it comes with bad taste. Everything tasted like bacon fat. I have no idea how they can make the toast to taste like bacon fat. Also potato is dry and free orange juice is from frozen juice pack.  Unless you don't care about quality of food, don't try it.  You will regret it when you are in the washroom getting sick."}
{"text":"Not for me, it's cheap and u get what u are paying for.....greasy eggs, greasy fries, bad coffee, bad orange juice... But hey.... It's cheap ..... I rather pay more for what I'm eating to be honest"}
{"text":"I love this place, they are so family oriented !!! We come here once in awhile and it's good to see that there are still places that take the effort to remember  you. The service is efficient and the food is a great greasy spoon.   The whole idea of them remembering us makes me and my family feel at home. Amazing food and most importantly AMAZING staff. Thanks for always accommodating us and always going the extra mile."}
{"text":"Classic greasy spoon. Good people, good service, it's a dying breed, get a basic and affordable breakfast in you before this place turns into an izakaya."}
{"text":"After reading multiple reviews on here, I avoided this place. My friend suggested we try it and I was extremely sceptical.   When we went we both ordered the eggs benny. Not the best quality food but it was good for the price we paid. The homefries were surprisingly good and I was impressed. The servers were kind, and it was a friendly environment. Overall it was a good dining experience, and I was blown away especially after reading the reviews here.  I've been back a couple times, and I've noticed some things: sometimes the homefries are great, but sometimes they taste like a freezer-burnt mess. Sometimes the staff is cheery but sometimes they're clearly overwhelmed and they do get grouchy. You just have to be clear with your order, and when you say you're ready to order make sure you're actually ready to order!  Overall, it's a good place. You get what you pay for and more times then not it's a good experience. I keep going back so I'd say it's a good place!"}
{"text":"mostly bland food in a slightly charming woody atmosphere ~ friendly service.  instant decaf was a disaster.. (get your coffee down the street) My friend ordered a Greek salad w dressing on the side (dressing didn't come on the side). salmon and spinach omelet was nothing amazing.. asked for feta w it (came a tiny bit sprinkled on top)."}
{"text":"Will never go back to this restaurant again.  I overheard the owner mistreating another customer who happened to be black.  When I asked the owner to apologize to the customer for being completely out of line, the owner started telling me off.  I am boycotting this restaurant and encourage others to do the same.    Message to owner: I believe your comments were racially motivated and I encourage you to seek counselling and sensitivity training.    In this day and age I am astonished to see that people behave the way you did.  PS - the only reason I clicked one star is because the system said I had to in order to post this comment."}
{"text":"A staple of a good diner should be great coffee - and this place doesn't have it. I've been here a couple of times because it is a couple of steps from my office, but I won't be returning. The food, at best, is mediocre. The service is also sub-par. I waited 40 minutes for a tuna sandwich with fries. The restaurant wasn't busy, patrons that came in long after I did received quicker service and to top it off, the sandwich was salty and the fries were bland and under cooked.  Don't waste your time and money - there are plenty of other spots in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying this place out today. my friend and I was greeted and quickly seated. our drinks came fast.  we were very eager to eat..the only waitress working was busy speaking with an elderly customer.  we waited over 20 minutes.. but her friendly conversation never seemed to end. there was customers waiting to at the same time.  we have up and left.  we were offered the drinks for free and an apology with an explanation that the waitress hasn't seen that customer and she was a nun.  I would not attempt this place again."}
{"text":"Johnny G's is the place to be's!   Expect them to be busy for breakfast time. Expect free coffee or tea AND juice with the entire brunch menu. Expect your mug to be like no one else's. Expect them to take care of you.   I've had samplings of various breakfast combos but a standout for me was the homemade burger. I'm not used to being asked how I want mine done! So Canadian. It's a juicy burger with perfect portions of all the standard burger topping. I've never been able to finish more than half of it and if you get there during brunch hours, you will still get the harshbrowns, coffee or tea and juice despite it not being a breakfast-y dish.   They do have slipups sometimes but it is such a charming place that whatever happens is always forgiven. You can just tell that they are honestly trying and sometimes only one server is working so come what may. Expect to leave full and expect a good time!"}
{"text":"Quick food, greasy spoon. Coffee is good. Not much to say about the food other than its typical of a diner. The main waitress is efficient and  has a friendly banter with the regulars."}
{"text":"I joined my two regular diner-mates and a surprise first-timer here this a.m., and on a beautiful day with the huge \"garage door\" windows open, it's a great space with the morning sun washing in.  It looks hip and trendy from the outside, but don't worry, it's just a greasy spoon.  ;-)  My breakfast special was A-OK, but with nothing exceptional.  (Typical diner coffee, boring \"Wonder\" brown toast, and cubed and deep fried - but home made, methinks -  home fries...see Connie T's photo).  2 of my friends had the Corned Beef Hash which they pronounced, \"meh\".  Our lovely newcomer had one of the breakfast specials which was very good. I forget what it was called.  Sooo, the space is great on a nice day, the service is friendly, attentive and quick, and the food is average.  Good value for a typical diner meal."}
{"text":"Food is OK, nothing special.  Most of the breakfasts I've eaten there are usually over cooked, especially the eggs.  You ask for over easy...because you like to dip your toast in them...you get over-med to well done.   The main server there who is an older brunette women is nice, but plays favourites with her regulars.  Last time I was in there with my partner, she left his breakfast sitting  on the counter while she just kept gabbing away to these people for a good 5-10mins.  This morning I tried to have breakfast there by myself .  She told me to sit anywhere, so I took a seat at a clean table.  These 2 male customers come in after me and she cleans there table...gets them coffees and menus...then takes there order.  Meanwhile I'm sitting there not even being acknowledged.  After 10 mins, I walked out.    I don't plan on going back.  I'll walk the extra blocks to Chew-Chews Diner."}
{"text":"Johnny G's offers a great all-day breakfast deal--you get tea/coffee, juice, eggs, toast, hash browns, and sausages for under $10. It's good diner food but nothing super special (maybe just the good price). My friend had the alexander burger (beef patty, your regular toppings and a thick slab of cream cheese) and it was AMAZING!   We went for an early dinner at around 4pm on a weekday so it wasn't busy at all. Service was great. The environment is super laid back.  Makes me wish I was back in Toronto just kicking with a breakfast plate and the crosswords!"}
{"text":"It has all day breakfast and WiFi. The location is right in Cabbagetown. The building has a big window that let's in a lot of light and air. The breakfast is tasty and cheap. Always my go to place!"}
{"text":"If you want to eat homestyle brunch, come to Johnny G's. It's a nice place to escape the city and enjoy your local food diner. It's on parliament street, the atmosphere is very welcoming. I feel like I'm at my grandpas kitchen. It's a nice cafe. If you're more of a country side kind of person, who enjoys small towns with local diners. You won't be disappointed. Definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times and come with a friend who has been here at least twenty times in less than two years.  On the plus side: - reliable quality food - cozy dining room in winter, open floor-to-ceiling windows in summer  - unpretentious atmosphere and menu (no quinoa with chorizo and kale breakfast bowls or anything like that- and when you eat your smoked salmon eggs benny, that's alright!) - decent prices (between fall and now, prices have gone up about a dollar with a new menu print-out) - unlimited coffee - if you come at the tail end of brunch on a weekend and there is no one waiting for a table, you can stay and chat with coffee, and linger without feeling bad  Cons: - might get fast service one day, slow to greet and take orders another day - backup kitchen and wait staff arrived at noon on a Sunday rush (seemed quite late given that the only server was rushing and doing everything for a dining room of 20 tables- hats off to her) - if OJ comes with the breakfast, we were not told of this (perhaps we didn't read the menu well enough) - if you're looking for interesting, innovative, super-healthy, local, trendy, hipster food/atmosphere, look elsewhere; this place is a reliable bet when you don't know where else to go or the wait is too long elsewhere"}
{"text":"Edible... but not a place I would eat at again. Subpar chicken burger and fries. What really brings the score down was a hair my friend and I found on a pickle... yikes."}
{"text":"Service friendly, small-town feel.  Very nice, attentive but not overbearing.  Both people working took a smoke break and started smoking right outside the open entrance door....so the whole place smelled like smoke.  I'm not a huge fan of that, despite my affinity to date and befriend smokers exclusively.   Well priced.  Unexciting.  Women's bathroom door - don't even try to go in there, you will get locked in and die, most likely.  That my be my strange fear of getting locked in public washrooms talking, but that door DEFINITELY doesn't close right...  Our meals were supposed to come with tea/coffee, but we got none and no one offered...  3 stars because of the pricing and the sweet service."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast last weekend. The service was not speedy but the prices were very reasonable, and you got both coffee and orange juice with your meal!   It was the Monday between Canada Day and the Weekend, so I don't think Johnny was expecting the place to be mobbed. I had the English Breakfast for 8.50 and my girlfriend got the Eggs Benny. She said the Hollandaise was very nice and homemade."}
{"text":"Johnny G's is a old school breakfast brunch diner. There is fast service even when busy. The waitresses there really now their stuff. If it is busy, let the coffee pour and chat up with friends while you wait for the traditional take on breakfast and brunch. Reasonably priced,  the food is a good way to start any day or help with that nasty hangover you all earned overnight.  Not looking for expensive over worked breakfast plates you can't begin to figure out? Then Johnny G's is the perfect place. The food is great, the service is good and the atmosphere is always friendly and warm. I always take my friends from out of town here and they'll love it. You really can't go wrong. Unless you're a compete psychopath."}
{"text":"There is something to like about this hole in the wall. Yes, it is tiny, basic, inexpensive, in your face and always crowded during brunch hours. Really, it is always busy with a few people lining up outside, like bees to honey just waiting to get in. The line is not Aunties and Uncle's long, but enough to be worth about 10 minutes' worth.    Is there anything fancy about this place? Nope. Is the food served with a shot of straight up-ness (yup, like totally made that up) well, yeah. Eggs, sausage and bacon is the law of the land with a few sandwiches, waflles/pancakes and burgers, to keep the rest company but trust me, it is a very small party.   It is definitely a place worth checking out. Oh, I would like to add that Lisa B. wrote a review about this place being full of crying children. I can honestly say that is quite the rarity although this place IS in Cabbagetown so it is feasible to have the odd yuppie parents venture in... although not one that I have seen more than once or twice in the last decade I have been coming here.  The place is a little too small to afford huge, SUV-sized strollers parked next to tables so most parents with progeny tend to stay away. Phew...  If you want a no-nonsense breakfast then this is a place to try."}
{"text":"I love new brunch places, so I'm giving this place a 3 star rather than a two, but otherwise it would get a 2.  I went on a sunday which might as well be renamed brunnchday and it was, as expected, packed. the good thing was we were able to get a table quickly but, every table was full and there was only ONE waitress. who, btw, was ridiculously rude. i at one point thought maybe it was a joke, she was being so rude.  the food came very quickly once we finally got our orders in and it was good, but nothing to write home about. there is tea or coffee and orange or apple juice with the breakfast, which is nice.   the waitress winked at me and called me honey when i was paying as though she hadn't been a meany the whole entire time.   your waitron can really make or break your experience and unfortunately she really made mine a terrible one.  i would try it once more as it is in a lovely area and the place itself is quite cute, but if the server is rude again, it's bad enough to boycott. what kind of brunch place only has one waiter on a sunday morning?"}
{"text":"Always on the hunt for good breakfast in my neighborhood, I was surprised to see this pop up on Yelp recently.  Had I never noticed this place before or was it new (I actually don't know the answer..)  Regardless, we saw the 3 star rating and decided to try it after looking at the menu.  I believe that Johnny G's deserves 4 stars.  It's one of the cheapest joints in Cabbagetown for breakfast (well under $10) and the service was friendly and quick.  The food wasn't overly flavorful but once again, it was $6.99.  I felt like it was good for the price point.  The space is huge and full of natural light (and on nice days, all the windows are open).  There was a decent sized menu and a good one for lunch, so maybe I need to come back.  Overall - will your breakfast tastebuds be amazed? No.  But will they be satisfied and your pocket book only a little lighter?  Yes."}
{"text":"I love a greasy diner! And I found one!  This place has a great family owned and operated vibe....I'm not actually sure if that's accurate, but I'm gonna go with that anyway.  The staff is lovely and attentive, and there's no shortage of coffee refills.  The quantities are large...do not expect to easily finish a breakfast.  They run in the 6.50 to 10 dollar range...which isn't the cheapest, but the quantity makes up for it for sure.   I had a the big breakfast, and my only complaint was in the quality of the bacon...could have been a little higher and less fatty.  The sausages looked delish though...will be trying those next time instead.  My companion had the eggs benny, and was loving it.   I feel like I might become a regular."}
{"text":"For $7 - $12, I got a decent sized breakfast. In fact, so much that I could not finish. Casual atmosphere, busy hostesses, friendly and fast service. Good for an easy-going crowd who want a comfortable place and lots of food. Also good for those hungry weekend mornings.  Atmosphere:  2.5/5, simple, casual, a bit crowded Food: 3/5, generous amount of food Service: 4.5/5, quick, casual, friendly Crowd: 2.5/5, ah..no need to say more"}
{"text":"I ended up here because gourmet burger next door was closed. I was hungry and look at review for this place it looked decent. Thou seem like might be good or bad but I'm taking my chances  Got serve almost immediately, so that a plus. Small diner, decor isn't anything special thou. On the table was still wet didn't bother to wipe it down. Still a bit sticky.  I should note its been about 20 mins wait which isn't bad. Eggs,sausage, ham, bacon and home fires were good. My only was hard slightly toasted toast.   All in all a good meal, service was lacking, waitress was friendly but didn't really check in much on me. She went out in front of restaurant to smoke, I guess they dont have back entrance. It's off setting but what can you do."}
{"text":"I used to come here over 10 years ago and this place was legendary.  Amazing cheap breakfast, great service.  I still come here from time to time but seems like the place mellowed out a bit but then again I don't come here on the weekends much.  You get your typical breakfast with bottomless coffee 3 eggs, toast, jam, sausage bacon or ham for $6.95...you can't beat that unless you go to some really dirty joint.  If you go to a hipper hood they serve the same breakfast throw a little parsley on top and omg we're gourmet now and we must add another 5 dollars to the price.  Places like this are hard to find and for a guy who likes to eat breakfast in the afternoon this is a hidden gem for cheap breakfast."}
{"text":"It's an amazing place with a great set-up. The food isn't expensive either and the portions are huge for what you pay. It's not usually busy so everything is quick."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying that I'm a huge fan of simple, homey restaurants but the quality of the food here just does not cut it.  I was excited to try the Eggs Oscar but could not have been more disappointed.The asparagus was completely mushy and salty, the English muffin stale, the Hollandaise thick and gloopy, there was eggshell in my poached egg and the coffee was bitter. Just as well that we were never offered a refill. Hubby had steak and eggs, ordered medium but it was almost raw and gristly. Nasty stuff. Basically the worst breakfast either of us have ever had. (We kept thinking 'Is this a joke?' and half expected that someone was going to pop out and tell us that we'd just been punked because seriously, what kind of restaurant serves food like this??)  The atmosphere was also really lacking. The table was sticky and while I love any type of ethnic music, the Greek (?) music blaring from the kitchen on poor quality speakers was so loud it was anxiety-producing and made us want to leave as quickly as possible.   A bonus point for the real OJ and mashed potatoes.  There are many other far better breakfast options in the area. I have NO IDEA how this place could be rated so highly. Hopefully it was an off day.   Sorry, not recommended."}
{"text":"Ugh.... I've been debating on writing this review as I come here all the time and the food is always consistently adequate. I've even gotten over the fact that the tables are always sticky because of the paint used on them and no clear coat.   EDIT: Originally I tried to validate the service levels of one of their waitresses, while holding the other accountable to the multiple times I've had bad experiences. Turns out the one that has left me disappointed/downright offended repeatedly is actually the owner. So I will no longer be giving my money to this place. Here is still my last experience for your reviewing needs...  Now the place was busy, so I forgave the fact of how long after being seated it took to get a menu, order and receive the food... But here we are a good 60+ minutes into the experience, I ask for more water. A simple request, yet the reply I receive from her is \"if I have time\". Never in all my life of dining has a server tell me they would only do something \"if they have time\". I wasn't even sure how to respond so instead waited. In the next 15 minutes of finishing our meals, no water is brought. Meanwhile she continued to deliver water and coffee to other tables. And for some reason I still tipped her well (I think I was just dehydrated and flustered by the time I was paying my bill and wanted to get out). In this time the woman also yelled at other customers for questioning how much longer their food would be because their child was getting whiney. I normally don't side with parents who bring kids to restaurants, but in this case it was just another example of this womans inability to properly serve customers professionally. Especially knowing now that it was the owner that gave this \"I don't give a fuck\" attitude, I have not nor will not be returning."}
{"text":"This is a classic diner. No pretence. No fancy menus. I like it.  Starting at $6 you can get a full breakfast with coffee (and free refills). Also included in the price is friendly service (when is the last time my waiter called me a sweetheart?) and a chill atmosphere. I went around 930am after deciding I couldn't work another minute without some caloric intake. Luckily Johnny's G's is only 10 min from where I work. The tables were half full. People were lounging about, reading the newspaper, enjoying their refills. There is also free wifi. The tables are wooden and comfy.  My breakfast was filling. I got 2 eggs, side of toast, potatoes, ham (you can get sausage or bacon instead). I was very full.  They have a number of breakfast meals, most of them under $10.   I'd go back here for a casual brunch (or late breakfast). Or just for coffee.  They also have lunch and dinner items. To give you an example, they had a turkey dinner on for $11. Deal."}
{"text":"Partner and I tried this place out for brunch ..... won't be back.   I had terrible french toast my partner had terrible scrambled eggs, sausage and home fries.... greasy and bland.  This place is FILTHY!!!!! and DIRTY!!!! I was looking for a way to post pics I took of filth encrusted salt and pepper shakers, tables and chairs .... no surface in this restaurant was free of build-up and grime. I'm not looking for fancy but cleanliness is a matter of public health ...   After placing our order, I noticed that the cutlery was dirty ... that is .... ALL THE CUTLERY AT OUR TABLE / 2 spoons, 2 knives, 2 forks - were smeared with grease. When I asked for a new set they were immediately replaced with clean cutlery, without fuss.  Shortly after that something in the salt shaker caught my eye, upon closer inspection, it looked like lint and dirt in the salt. So I asked to exchange the salt with people nearby, and when they handed their salt to me ..... I could see lint and dirt in the salt. I opened it up  and shook out about 1 tsp to see that it was lint and dirt mixed in with the salt. I'm no detective but it seems like someone must've spilled salt on a counter or floor and used it anyway to refill the shakers.  So.... I called the owner, who was also waitressing, and showed her the salt shaker ... she was appropriately mortified and removed it.... and took the original one I had swapped earlier,and placed it on our table. When I told her it was also dirty / contaminated salt, she wouldn't hear it... she refused to examine it saying that sometimes seasonings get mixed into the salt. ????? Really????  It was not seasoning ... it was hairs, and lint, and crumbs and other unidentifiable particles. Oh ... and the shaker itself was so dirty it looked like it had been rolled in grease and ketchup, dried to a crust and them rolled in grease and ketchup, repeatedly, over the next few years .... as I said I took pictures.  To think that this is what could be seen ... the thought of what the kitchen looked like, behind-the-scene, makes me feel ill.   It might seem that after all of this it makes sense that we did not enjoy our food ... but the food was lousy and poorly prepared. Period.  I am writing this review as a WARNING: that if you are someone with a compromised immune system, highly susceptible to food poisoning  - or you simply don't like to eat food off of and/or from apparatus caked in years of dirt (and probably fecal matter) ... this restaurant is not for you (or your children or elderly parents and friends).  PS - the staff were friendly and welcoming although someone needs to introduce them to a scrub brush and heavy duty degreasers and disinfectants! Shame!"}
{"text":"Johnny G's was pretty good. The food was okay, the service was excellent. Our coffee and water were always refilled and the staff were very warm here. I had the chicken eggs Benedict which was good, but not amazing, and a little bit pricey. The potato wedges were big but surprisingly good. I'm usually not a fan but I liked these ones. I might come back for a burger but probably not for breakfast."}
{"text":"Johnny G's is one of the best breakfast spots in the city.  Often packed during weekend breakfast hours (ie all day), you probably won't find better quality for the cheap price.  For about $7 after tax and tip, you get a full breakfast, plus coffee and a small orange juice.  The woman who seems to always be there is one of the friendliest breakfast people in the city.  Very momish in all the best ways.  Service here is great, and the food always comes quickly.  The place has a very homey feel, with things like their huge variety of coffee mugs (almost every single one is different) making for fun conversation.  It's also worth noting that they have a sign on the window that states 'Best Burgers in the City,' but I've never tried 'em.  I just can't turn down the breakfast."}
{"text":"Garbage and that is exactly what we felt about the food they served us.  Cream of mushroom soup that was actually beige water, pea-meal sandwich which was ridiculously small and tasteless, salad with wilted brown lettuce and an owner who could not take feed back and actually blamed us for not liking the food.  The experience was completely unpleasant and the owner is beyond rude. The bill came to over $27.00 which included the tip that she added on without our knowledge.  I can hardly believe this happened.  I had been going for years and it was always great, had not been back for a couple of years. Now there are big changes that are very unpleasant.  They have lost a customer for life, in fact a bunch of customers because of this.  Terrible mistake to take a visiting friend there after telling him how exceptional the place was.  I have never been so humiliated. We are not the sort of people that go around needlessly complaining.  However, this is the only way I can express my profound disappointment since she (the owner) was actually aggressive, argumentative and just plain nasty."}
{"text":"I went to Johnny's this morning.   You can tell this is a family owned business, grandma, mum, dad, daughter and son I'm pretty sure. They have nice touches like mints and toothpicks and my coffee was served in an old mug which read \"my mum's the best\" which was so touching.   The atmosphere is very relaxed, there's a nice breeze from the open windows and strong fans going at the top. Service is quick - I got my breakfast in about 4 minutes after ordering with table service.   food....The coffee was soooo good. I'm a coffee lover, very much so this was a surprise to me. I've had a few eggs benny in my time so I'm spoiled. The eggs were perfectly cooked. The english muffins were below average, so was the hollandaise, and the home fries. It made me feel a bit sick but I hardly have an iron stomach. I didn't see anything wrong with the orange juice, it was just cheap.   I have this friend, he eats in food courts in malls, he never complains about food and he would eat things I would otherwise turn my nose up at. But that's him and I've eaten some very good food in my time so that's an important factor here.   If basically get what you pay for here, the food is so cheap, and the service is great, and the atmosphere is nice. I haven't tried the burgers yet but they could be fantastic. The poutine the lady was having next to me looked a bit sad.   The thing is, yelpers are critical that's why they are here. If you like nice food, the eggs benny is not for you. If you are fussy about service and atmosphere, then it is. Its a great place to feel like you've gone home to mums house for breakfast or just to have a coffee or a cold drink."}
{"text":"Would not recommend it. Had eggs benedict and OJ for breakfast. It felt like the ingredients for the food were somehow old, the potatoes undercooked and the benedict without hollandaise sauce. Further, the OJ was watered down! Would not eat again."}
{"text":"I thought I'd venture away from my usual Saturday morning breakfast joint b/c I had heard good things about Johnny G's and wanted to check it out.    My bf and I walked in, and the place was packed - usually a good sign.  The unfortunate thing, however, is that it was jam packed full of screaming children, some running around everywhere.  While I can't really blame the restaurant for this, I'm not sure if this is a common occurrence.    The menu was fairly basic (wish there were more options), but CHEAP.  Can't complain about that.  I ordered the spinach and feta omelette with home fries.  The home fries were pretty tasty.  The omelette was okay, nothing special.  The eggs tasted a bit different than what I was used to.  Good amount of food and beverage (coffee and orange juice) included too.    While I can appreciate it was busy so the waitress was trying her best to fulfill everyone's needs quickly, it seemed like she was the one doing everything even though there were other people working.    To be honest, other than it being cheap, I don't really see the greatness of this place.  I'll be going back to my usual joint."}
{"text":"Johnny G's is a Cabbagetown staple. The diner has very good quality and great prices. Big windows make it a great brunch spot on a nice day!  Great service too."}
{"text":"Great food, very good service, price is the only reason they didn't get five stars. Menu is broad and plares are full.  I'll be back"}
{"text":"I hate writing reviews like this but what we encountered here two weeks ago has STILL been on my mind so I've got to get it out.  We came for brunch and sat at a window table, ordered drinks and watched as our server went out for a smoke before bringing them to us ( and stood right in front of our table for the entirety of it so it was really hard to miss. ) She brought us our drinks (without washing her hands before she started carrying people's food to their tables I might add) and started taking our food order. Then the funniest thing happened - her cell phone rang, and she answered it, MID ORDER. She didnt even excuse herself or really check who was calling, she just whipped out her phone and started gabbing away in another language, while my husband and I stared in disbelief. She even went as far as to walk away from the table on her phone without us finishing ordering our food. Now, I know, we should have taken the opportunity to leave right then and there but it was freezing outside and I was enjoying my tea so we thought it would at least be entertaining to see what else could happen.  About 10  minutes later she came back to \"pick up where she left off\" and finish taking our order. Food came and was fine, no complaints, other than her smelling of cigarettes and not washing her hands every time she came back from one of her frequent breaks.  We watched as her and the older gentleman in the kitchen got into a screaming match about \"her only having two hands\" in the middle of the restaurant and then answer her phone again while taking another table's order - with their reaction to it being way less shocked than ours - so these things might just be some of the enjoyed atmosphere of the place.   Either way this place is a pretty serious staple in the area it seems, so people must enjoy the \"entertainment\" with their meal."}
{"text":"This place is so awful we felt upset after had breakfast there. Me and my friend was in breakfast mood, turned out that they simply don't know how to cook, everything is sloppy and lousy. The cook must hate cooking breakfast or sth. Food is cold and takes forever to come to our table. They microwave all the shit which is not what I'm coming to restaurant for. For over 10 dollars a plate yet they can't even put butter on the toast. Instead there is puddle of margarine. My friend said the only good thing about this place is the water is cold!!! Don't throw your money in the drain and the food there would put you into mild depression."}
{"text":"By 4 stars, I mean that Johnny G's is great as a greasy spoon.  It's by no means a fine restaurant.  But if you're looking for a cheap breakfast with good quality ingredients, this is a great place.  Helen, the waitress (for the past 3 years anyway) is an absolute DEAR.  She's Greek, as is the ower, and really cares about your experience.  If you don't like something, tell her, and she'll make sure you're either not charged, or given something else.  This is a place where \"regulars\" convene.  The little old lady and her husband in the corner...always there.  I think they must have a room somewhere!    Best burgers?  I'm not qualified.  GREAT burgers?  Yes.  Brunch is the biz.  All day, every day.  Soups are quite good, if often too salty.  If you want to immerse yourself in a bit of the city, no pretensions, try this place out.  Young, old, gay, straight...this is a city crowd, in a city restaurant."}
{"text":"Johnny G's. My favourite post-party weekend brunch place. Their food is excellent! One of the best burgers I've had, and they're not even known for them. Hmm, gotta try the 'Homemade Burger', it's heavenly. Except, the bread can be a bit stale at times. To be honest, I probably only noticed after my 10th burger there (can you tell how often I'm there?), so it's not that big of a deal.  Again, like many places, visually it's meh. I mean, it's a diner. So who cares. But the food is great. And it's got a family feel to it, since the owner (a great Greek lady - love her! always cheery and chatty) is amazing and her family works there too. The other employees are all family or friends, and they are extremely friendly. Truly make you feel welcome - Greek style!  It's just a good place to go, eat good food and chat with friends. Not to mention, you get juice, potatoes/fries and coffee with every order. NomNom!"}
{"text":"the bf and i went here for dinner tonight.  he ordered the philly steak and cheese sand which i'm pretty sure was just made from the steak-umms frozen meat that you can buy in the frozen foods section of any supermarket--no kidding, steak-umms--nothing special here for sure.  i ordered the double pork chops which, in fact, were quite flavorful and tasty but, at the same time, were about 1/2 the size of what i expected for the price of CAD 9.95.  my dinner came with (instant) mashed potatoes and a less-than-generous serving of previously frozen carrots, peas, and corn.  pretty disappointing overall.  we both drank tap water with our meals so the total check came to CAD 18.20.  we gave the waitress a $20 and left never to return.  sorry johnny g's."}
{"text":"Definitely a nice diner breakfast. Swift service, caring wait staff, yummy pancakes! Not a gourmet experience, just a good breakfast for a good price and a good place."}
{"text":"My new breakfast place!    They serve great food though the speed of service could be improved on weekdays when in a hurry...  Would return again when looking to cure a headache :)"}
{"text":"Long-time Yelp reader, first time poster.  After living in the neighbourhood for a few months and consistently seeing the place jam-packed for weekend brunch, my girlfriend and I decided to check it out and see what all the fuss was about.  The decor of the place was a little dingy and most of the surfaces were sticky as someone else mentioned, though this didn't bother me all that much.  The young man who was our server was very polite and attentive. His friendly customer service made the rest of the experience a little more bearable.  After seating ourselves at a table, the server promptly got us coffees and soon after came to take our food orders. I ordered a steak (medium) and eggs and my girlfriend ordered an eggs benedict. When our meals arrived at the table I looked at the steak and was rather disappointed by the size and appearance of it.  It was very small in diameter, and it was amazingly thin. I'd say this steak's thickness was comparable shaved rare beef pieces they give you at pho restaurants.    As well, the consistency of this steak was like a big droopy booger.   I'm known to never leave any scraps of food on my plate at restaurants but I couldn't take more than two bites of this flavourless, boogery \"steak\" before ditching it. This thing literally could not be chewed.  The rest of the food was \"meh\" at the very best.   I would recommend House on Parliament to anyone looking for a breakfast/lunch joint in the area. The price there is incrementally higher but the food is exponentially better."}
{"text":"I was pretty skeptical of the bad reviews here since I'm pretty unpicky about diner food. This place was one of the only breakfast places open New Years Day and the staff were extremely enthusiastic considering they had to work on a holiday.   However the food was  truly lacking. The orange juice was watered down and tasted worse than just water. there was no seasoning on anything ordered. the food was just so mediocre. Given a choice of another restaurant, I don't think I would return."}
{"text":"When I go to Johnny G's, I expect and get nothing other than genuinely friendly service and decent food for a very good price.   Breakfast is their unofficial specialty.  I ordered my usual eggs florentine today. The $8.50 meal came complete with a tiny glass of questionably watery orange juice (which I obligingly gulped down) as well as a very tall mug of tea (or coffee, if you'd rather). The hollandaise is by no means the best in the city, but the eggs are most expertly poached to your specification of soft, medium, or hard, which in my experience, hardly any other restaurants bother to ask.   The laid back atmosphere, dated murals (the sign above the painted cafe says SMOKING), open air prime pedestrian watching window seat, and the good old fashioned menu makes me happy. I'll probably never try the hot liver with mashed potatoes and steamed veggies ($8.50), but it for some reason makes me smile to see on the menu.  My brunch date, on the other hand, had a very different experience and would be giving a very different account were he a yelper. It was his first (and very likely last) visit to Johnny G's. He ordered the French dip ($8.95 including a side of fries) and simply refused to touch it. Seriously. He took an apparently unsavoury bite and then poked at a few fries before declaring the whole thing inedible. After our poor server stopped by to inquire if everything was okay, he decided to ask for a take out box to be nice, but ended up tossing it right away.  So there you have it: Johnny G's is not for everyone, but I reckon you'd be more than pleasantly surprised though, if you go with a friend who is more open-minded (and doesn't have incredibly high expectations from the $10 he has in his pocket) and just stick to the breakfast options."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch because the House on Parliament was not yet opened, but in hindsight we really should have just waited. We walked in and took a table near the kitchen, because they kind of have this open kitchen thing going on and I like to see how my food is made when I can. Big mistake, huge. Watching eggs sop around on the flattop crusted with meat grease was not the most appetizing. We ordered anyway, because I think I was a little hungover and food is food.  The place itself is kind of charming, in an Old Country kind of way. Everything seemed to be a little bit sticky, or covered in a very fine layer of dust. I personally like cozy neighbourhood places because I'm hipster trash like that, but this was a little too sticky for my liking. Our waitress reminds me of my time staying over at my Greek friend's grandmother's house. I tried to thank her in Greek, but I just got a curt nod. It wasn't that she wasn't nice, but it was very apparent she knew who her regulars were, and I definitely was not one of them.   We ordered the Big Breakfast and Eggs Parisian with a side of asparagus. The asparagus came on a sad little plate and it seemed like it was dumped right out of a can. It was so sad looking I think it was crying on the plate, or perhaps canned salt water leaking onto the plate. I mentioned that I thought the asparagus was going to be fresh, or if not fresh then at least not mushy and limp. The waitress took it away and still billed us for it even though I barely ate one whole asparagus. I don't care so much about the $5ish as much as it is the principle of things. Both actual dishes were so underwhelming to the point I finally understood how my Asian parents felt when I told them I was pursuing a bachelor of arts degree.  There are so many other places to eat in Cabbagetown that I don't feel like Johnny G's should be your priority. Go brunch at any of the pub-like places down Parliament. Trust me, money back guaranteed."}
{"text":"My story seems very similar to many other reviews on here.  None of the other restaurants in the neighbourhood open up earlier than 11am during the week so I forced myself to give this place another try. Boy i wished I hadn't.  For the third time in 6 visits I found hair in my food.  What gives?  Seriously??? They charge a dollar for extra artificial maple syrup and the home fries are always tasteless.  The eggs,  bacon and toast were delicious but it was hard to get the picture of hair outta my head. Service was good but I will never be coming back here again.  Don't make the same mistake I did...."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff in a dingy but endearing spot! Our meals took an exceptionally long time in coming out but this was due, in part, to a large party that came in shortly before we did. We didn't feel this was addressed adequately by the servers but they did apologize for the wait eventually. The food was pretty good! We had burgers (mine a veggie, his a standard) and were overall pleased. They only accept cash, so come prepared."}
{"text":"Best of the Diner Squad.  I love it here.  Sure, it's not like eating at an el fancy joint for High Tea, but that's not what I want in a diner.  The family running Johnny G's is so great, I just want to eat here every day just to see them and how they interact with all their customers.  I see business folk, kids, families, weirdoes like me, and just about any combination of people here and everyone is welcome.  English Breakfast with beans makes my day, and oatmeal as a more slimming selection is fantastic.  The prices are right, the glasses of water are huge, and if you forget to ask for your orange juice, you get reminded. =D  Love it."}
{"text":"I have frequented this place many times over the years and had a great food experience. We were there about a month ago and the food was terrible. I had a Greek omelette and it was so over cooked and the cheese inside tasted bad. The hash browns/potatoes were not even cooked and the steak my hubby had with the eggs was a terrible cut. Not sure if they've had an ownership change as the people seemed new in there. It's sad but I will never go back there again!"}
{"text":"Open ambience, homely service, splendid breakfast and reasonable rates. There's nothing not to like about the place. Try their Egg Benedict."}
{"text":"Food 3/5 - just enough portions, not big. Fresh tasty omelet  Service 4/5 - friendly, taking care, helpful staff. Debit cards in service  Price 3/5 - $22 for two  Will be Back"}
{"text":"The burger here is excellent, the grilled cheese is good-drrrrty and they now have free WiFi! WHAT?  Life. Made.  PEPPER POINTS: for keeping it so damn real, G's."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch, but get there on the earlier side as they are always busy.  Good good food for a decent price.  Sometimes the service is lacking, but for the most part they are friendly.  Johnny G's is a on our short list of favorites."}
{"text":"Good food served by friendly staff in good portions.  A very decent breakfast place with all the menu choices you'd want in a greasy spoon style restaurant.  Regular coffee was good but they do not have decaf."}
