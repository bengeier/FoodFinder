{"text":"this location gets 1 star because I can't give no stars, when we arrived we required handicapped parking, 2 ladies quickly scooped up the spot , I kindly asked if we could use that spot because we had several persons in our large group that either had a whellchair, walker, or unsteady gait, the ladies told us \"when we get back\" and ran into the employee entrance, so we parked some place else, that should have qued us to just leave, but we went in anyways, it took 1 hour to get drinks and nearly 2 hours to get food, at least 5 tables came after us and left before us and we still hadn't received our meals, when the food did come it was dry and appeared microwaved, not even worth taking a picture of , although now I wish I had just to post how poor quality the food was, the matter was brought up with the manager and she was apologetic and offered 25% off the total bill, but after all that I just wanted to leave. our group was a large group of special needs people celebrating a birthday, I hate to think that had we had been somebody else would they have treated our group differently, shame on eastside marios and shame on there less then par food, really people don't waste your time or your money"}
{"text":"This place you for sure get a lot for your money however our server seemed kind of clueless. We were left at our table for a very long time before anyone came to take our drink order. Once we got our drinks everything seemed to turn around. The food was decent and our server came to refill our salad and soup. Overall an ok experience. We have been once before and had a great experience with the service however the food was luke warm at best when we got it, thus the 3 stars."}
{"text":"This review and rating reflects the glacially slow and unorganized service. Although friendly, the staff was not equipped to deal with the Sunday evening dinner \"rush.\" The food was good and what you would expect from East Side Mario's.

Upon entering the restaurant, I noticed that there was a wait even though there were many empty tables. The restaurant was relatively busy but by no means anywhere near full. There were also many tables that had yet to be cleared even though the customers had long left. This was a warning for things to come.

Once seated it took a long time before our server finally took our order. From there two children's drinks were forgotten and then they eventually showed up with no straws (which are needed because the cups have lids). After finishing our drinks we were wondering when our salad, bread, and soup would arrive .... Not for over half hour after asking what was going on. Then finally the main course arrives (for the adults) but the kids still have to wait. Also one pasta dish was missing the ordered chicken.

Finally, when it came time to pay the credit card machine did not have any paper left and it took 10 minutes for the final copy of the receipt to arrive. BTW - The same tables still remained uncleared with dirty dishes on them throughout the whole visit.

As noted above, the food was good once it arrived. No complaints there. Though I would suggest to stick to take out until this place gets its act together."}
{"text":"What idiot designed the door away from the parking lot...hostess was terrible ignored us for 10min. ....waitress very kind and funny perfect 
best part so far.....salad and bread came quick but it been 30 mins and no entrée and food was good the portabella mushroom parmigiana was fantastic. ...Okay overall if your not in a hurry and have 2 hrs to waste this is your place ....food is okay service is mediocre"}
{"text":"I came here for to celebrate my 28th birthday, and was very impressed with the service and overall experience, despite some initial hangups.

Going into the restaurant (which is located on Dundas, next to a large chain mall with a Walmart), I was intrigued to discover that they had only opened two weeks earlier. This is despite having congratulatory certificates from the City of Mississauga on its opening in August 2015 - I assume that these were from another location that was nearby and closed, or from the restaurant before it was renovated. Regardless, I knew to keep my expectations fully in check.

The meal started out very slow, as we had to wait for a long time for salad, bread and refills. Our server, Colin, was very apologetic, and we could see that there was a sudden influx of people lined up by the door, and in subzero weather no less. Later on, he and another server mentioned in passing that there were problems with the restaurant's automated order system, which was causing orders to get backlogged and delayed. I attributed it to growing pains, although I understand there was another family sitting next to us who was dealing with the exact same problem and eventually got fed up and left.

The food was a mixed bag overall. The dish I ordered (double-bacon carbonara) and the one my mother ordered (chicken tetrazzini) was hot and tasted great, but everyone else's dishes had to be sent back. My grandmother's grilled chicken was dry, while my grandfather's hamburger and fries was overcooked/cold, respectively. We ended up sending three of the dishes back, and the server told us that those would be comp'd for us.

Why, then, am I giving this four stars? The servers were all incredibly polite and focused on making sure we had a great experience, despite how busy the restaurant was. The entire staff made time to come out and sing to me for my birthday, the server (Colin) was very apologetic and got to us as quickly as he could, and in the end, the manager decided to comp our entire meal, which was an unexpected surprise.

If you go in with your expectations firmly in check (after all, the restaurant did open two weeks earlier, as of this review's publication date), you'll have a good time. I noticed how lively and energized the atmosphere of the restaurant was. I would definitely go back again, and I had a great experience overall.

Recommended."}
{"text":"The food is fun and the atmosphere can be nice but the service is disappointing. I was there a few days ago and I saw a young family get treated very poorly. The restaurant had a problem with how much space the newborn was taking on the benches where they were sitting. They told the father that he was taking up too much space and that customers may want to sit there. I looked around and the place was almost empty. I have to chalk this up to the immaturity of the host. He seemed very young and probably completely ignorant of how hard it is to take a newborn out for a meal. The worst part about this is that, after the family left, the host and a waitress started making fun of the family \"He didn't understand that he was taking up so much space, what's wrong with them? Look, they forgot their takeout containers. I mean, they asked for them and then they forgot them. What's their problem?\".  I talked to the host afterwards but realized I was going nowhere. I talked to the family and they were disappointed and attributed the host's age to his lack of empathy. It's not the firs time ignorant stuff like this happens at this restaurant. This place is definitely not for families."}
{"text":"Great service every time we visit.  Ashley knows how to work, as she was bartending, as well as serving several tables.  She's an all-star!

Food portions are just right!"}
{"text":"Wow. 

Can't recommend this place. Took my family there last night for my daughters birthday dinner. After being sat, took a few mins for our server to arrive and take drink orders. 
And downhill from there. Almost 20
Mins later 5/6 of the beverages arrived and food order was taken. 
Watched two tables near us get there beverages, then dinner orders while we waited. Last drink didn't show. Appetizers didn't show. 
Servers yelled profanities jovially across dining room at other staff...right in front of manager. 
Still no food arrived. We had been waiting just over 45 mins. 
As neighbouring tables had their plates cleared, we told our server we were leaving. He then went on how hard his night was because he had been given 4 tables at once. 
Perhaps they need more staff. 
This shouldn't be the customers issue.
Wait a waste of an evening. 
No stars."}
{"text":"Went in there. Took 10 minutes for someone to come take my order. After getting my salad, I had to wait for more than 35 minutes to get my entrée. It doesn't take that long to cook pasta. My food seemed like it was blasted it the microwave. The meatballs were salty as hell. Pasta and the grilled cheese didn't look fresh at all! I have been to East side Mario's and have had very good experiences but this was one of the worst experiences I've had anywhere. The only thing good was that they didn't charge me for the bad experience. Hope this branch steps up their game!"}
{"text":"Oh boy, I'm just going to jump right into it...

PROS
-great space
-love the furnishing and décor 
-bright and colourful 
-each table was nicely lit
-server was absolutely lovely - very polite

CONS
-service was dreadful and unbelievably slow
-waited 15-20 mins for the menu and water
-waited another 10-15 minutes for our order
-waited an additional 45-50 mins to get our food
-only 1 server on the floor
-\"Hell's Kitchen Chicken\" was good, definitely spicy but delicious - veggies on the other hand needed a lot of seasoning

Nope, nope, nope! Not coming back here I'll stick to the Heartland location, thank you very much."}
{"text":"This location of East Side Mario's is convenient to get to, in between two large shopping malls (Square One and Sherway Gardens), and is one of the franchise's newer locations. I have been to this location a few times and have had a great experience each time. The staff have always been polite and the service has always been fast whenever I visited. The food was similar to other East Side Mario's locations.

This location is unique in the area because it is one of Mario's test restaurants, meaning that they test new recipes for food and drink and evaluate them here before deciding whether to offer them in other locations. You can sometimes get something very unique compared to other locations because of this. The design of the restaurant itself is also appealing because it uses East Side Mario's' new layout, which is more open and modern. If you need to use the restroom, you can even learn Italian during your visit as the restaurant plays Italian language learning audio courses over the PA system.

All in all, a convenient, modern-looking, unique location with polite, efficient staff and good food at a reasonable price. Also, don't forget your Scene and CAA cards to pick up points for free movies and a great discount on all food at the restaurant if you're a CAA member."}
{"text":"This was the worst experience at this location ever. ordered seafood linguini with mussels, shimp and calamari (no calamari). when this location opened it was busy and the service and staff attentiveness was tip notch. last experiences have been steadily down hill. not even really busy.  probably our last visit to this location. probably ESM in general."}
{"text":"I was at this location this past Saturday with my partner, and two friends. Excited to see the new location - and enjoy some all you can eat soup, and salad, we had our expectations a bit too high. There was a bit of a wait, which seemed normal as it was Saturday evening, but while waiting to be seated we were skeptical of the professionalism of the workers, as they were constantly moving from their position, and clowning around with each other.  

Our waitress approaches the table, and we begun asking questions about the menu in which she seemed either nervous or distracted. She was stumbling on her words, and mixing up what she was trying to say, making it hard for us to get concise answers. We started off with ordering the A-Y-C-E salad, which we all did enjoy. The rest of my party ordered different types of pasta, one being the \"LINGUINE CHICKEN TETRAZZINI\" another the \"SPAGHETTINI & MEATBALLS GIGANTICO\" and the last was the \"FETTUCCINE ALFREDO.\" For myself I ordered a Portobello mushroom sandwich off the menu - which cannot be found on the online menu. 

We waited a normal amount of time for our food to arrive, in the meantime we decided to visit the girls room. My friend, and I were disgusted. The floors were covered in dirty toilet paper, and the sink area was completely drenched in water - AN OLD WOMAN WAS ACTUALLY WIPING IT DOWN BECAUSE SHE WAS EVEN MORE DISGUSTED WITH IT! Although a cute idea, the voice in the washroom \"teaching you italian\" is more of a nuisance than an assistance. After making fun of the translations for a few minutes we made our way back out to our table. 

Just before our waitress brought our food, she informs me that they have run out of portobello mushrooms for the night - mind you this is almost a half hour after we order - and then asks if the rest of my party would like the wait to eat their food until I chose something else off the menu. I'm pescetarian - meaning I do eat fish, but I am basically vegetarian. This forced me to pick a fish option due to the fact that EVERY SINGLE vegetarian option on the menu, used portobellos as the main ingredient. I asked to see the menu again, and decided to choose the \"SAUTEED BASA FILLET\" and insisted that my friends go ahead, and eat without me. 

Firstly, we all looked at the plates, and right away we all noticed both the linguine and fettuccine's portion sizes were pathetic. My friend then asked the waitress if this was the regular size portion, and she replied it was. (It literally wouldn't have filled a child and they also advertise them in the menu as \"A super-sized portion\") Although the taste was there, it was very sad in comparison to the Spagettini - which our waitress did assure us would be huge, and even asked if we'd like to DOWNSIZE the portion. Let me just add that the spagettini was less expensive than both the other dishes, so we were completely astonished by the sizes of all three. 

Less than fifteen minutes later she brings my fillet in which I was completely repulsed. It was described as a bass fillet, fried to golden brown over sauteed vegetables... WELL, my initial reaction was the appearance was far from restaurant quality. The vegetables were CLEARLY raw. Some even stuck together, and when pulled apart you could see the raw sides that never got cooked. They were also chopped very sloppily. There were cuts in multiple vegetables, but not cut all the way through - one big chunk of zucchini even had five slices half way through it. All the vegetables were unequal, and basically looked like it was thrown together by someone who's never chopped vegetables. The bass, burnt completely around the edges - which I could smell the second they placed the dish on my table - but had been facing downwards so it would go unseen. I called the closest worker over to my table, and asked to speak with the manager. The manager thankfully was very nice, as I pleaded my problems with the dish, she even pointed out that the bass was burnt, and this was not \"typical\" she then took the plate, and assured me she'd be back with another one. At this point my friends were basically done eating, so I insisted it was fine, and that I didn't need another one. She then persisted that I get a dessert instead, on the house. I accepted politely and picked the funnel cake, which I did not have any problems with.

Our original waitress returns to the table with our cheque, and asked we pay right now because she was about to finish her shift, but told us we could stay as long as we like. I found her to be a little pushy about it, but we did understand where she was coming from, and we were basically finished up anyways. All in all, I found it to be very mediocre for what is suppose to be a well known, popular family restaurant. I will not be returning to this location, EVER."}
{"text":"Let me start off with saying our server was lovely. She was super sweet. 
We were sat at a dirty table and the greeter wiped our cutlery with her hands. 
The food was abysmal. I ordered the gluten free chicken tetrazzini with the salad. I made it clear I was celiac so please no croutons. And to make it easy the other guests at my table had the same salad with no croutons just so there was little chance of contamination. 
Our cutlery was covered in previously enjoyed food so we stole cleaner cutlery from another table. 
My guests ordered make your own pasta. Both with the same sauce but different proteins. 
The salad arrives with croutons mixed in, not even on top so I took a bite and found myself with a crouton before me. The waitress as busy as she was wasn't around to tell until she was ready to clear the plates. So the salad was a bust. 
The pasta arrives. My gluten free pasta had no chicken. One of the other pasta dishes had almost a brown sauce on it compared to the similarly ordered dish which had a white sauce. The one pasta dish was about 2/3 the size of the other similar pasta. 
Overall not a great experience."}
{"text":"The servers are really nice! Been here 3 times, food isn't that amazing but it's still tasty when you're really hungry. Love the bread and Caesar salad, tried cheese capelleti ( a alittle dry)  4 cheese pizza, veal parmigiana (so good!) and chicken Tetrazzini. Love their peach bellini as well"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love East Side Marios?
All you can eat bread and salad with almost everything on the menu? Yes please!!

Came here tonight for date night, this location is BRAND NEW, just opened recently.
At a prime location of dixie and dundas, easy to get to and the only location in this part of Mississauga.

Our server was great, we didn't catch his name but he was super friendly, helpful and quick.
He explained that this location is the \"corporate location\" and that they will always be the first location to test new menu items.

The restaurant is not too large, but plenty of seating room. The washrooms are a tad small but very nice. 
There is also a takeout section where you can purchase food to go.

I ordered the Broccoli, parmesean penne with chicken, which was delicious!
The portion size was a bit big but much much smaller than most of the pasta items on the menu.
It was fantastic!
We didn't buy any appetizers as the All you can eat bread and salad is more than enough!

Love this location, will definitely be back!

5/5"}
{"text":"Checked out the new ESM Location on Dundas !
Pretty nice set up and decor .
The bathrooms play a learn Italian while you visit the stall mix tape , lol pretty funny ..
Typical Marios food no complaints .
The waitress was very friendly and service was decent . 
All in all I was full in the end and happy with service . And that's what makes you wanting to come back ! 
Check em out for sure if you want a franchise style restaurant !"}
{"text":"Slowest service of all time. Parking lot is filled with construction trucks. Never coming back. goodbye."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner a few weeks ago and was thoroughly disgusted. I had a chicken wrap which was a newer item on the menu. My boyfriend had chicken parmigiana. The chicken for both was the same!!! It was the same overly crispy fried chicken the only difference was mine was cut up into pieces and sloppily thrown into a wrap and slathered with some kind of mayo sauce. My boyfriend had meat on his plate with plain white pasta and tomato sauce and cheese slapped on the plate. We will definitely not be going back we were so unimpressed! With that being said we did have their  bread which was fine but very greasy."}
{"text":"Really? Big hockey tournament in the area and only two waiters in the entire restaurant. Terrible service. Food was ok but got tired of waiting, we would have ordered more but was too much of a hassle. Unbelievable"}
{"text":"Anyone who chooses this particular East Sides please beware. 
I visited this location only two weeks after its grand opening with a close friend of mine with high expectations. I mean.. it's East Side Mario's, a generic Italian food chain restaurant, it's usually always on point. BUT NOT THIS LOCATION. 

Our waitress was as new as the restaurant. It hadn't seemed like she ever served before, she had no knowledge of the menu what-so-ever, but at least she was still polite. We were seated by the Take-Out section which faced the desk/register and part of the kitchen. It seemed almost like a high school pep rally with the amount of clowning around carried out by the \"staff\" in clear view of the customers. I witnessed a young female server bring her boyfriend into the kitchen. 

I constantly noticed one lady who for the entire time I assumed didn't even work there because she was in sloppy clothing and behaved very unprofessionally with the other staff, but she kept going in and out of the kitchen. It turned out this was the manager of the restaurant who visited our table after I found a hair in my Alfredo pasta.. but I'll get to that.

The unlimited caesar salad was so thick and wet with an overloaded amount of dressing it was inedible. We returned it only to get the same bowl of salad delivered back to our table. I ordered a simple meatless Alfredo pasta with broccoli and gluten-free noodles. When the pasta arrived it had no broccoli so I sent it back. When it returned it had three measly pieces of broccoli resting on top of the noodles. The dish was completely dry and unappealing. I picked up a forkful of noodles to find a short hair nuzzled in my pasta. 

The manager came over. Her half-a**ed apology didn't sit very well with me. I don't think she ever looked me in the face one time. She informed us to order anything else off the menu at no cost but we declined. 

Disgusting restaurant and horrible service. Drive to the Winston Churchill location if you can."}
{"text":"Why on earth am I here again. No amount of free bread can fix the deficit this chain has when it comes to customer service. The didn't have high chairs, took 15 minutes to be seen by a server and food came out cold. It's pasta... 

I would be happy getting what I paid for here but I can't even say we got that.

Go anywhere else. Anywhere."}
{"text":"Went for early dinner on SUNDAY.Servers were friendly but the food was not very tasty. The Fettuccini Alfredo was bland and overcooked ,sitting in a watery white sauce.The salmon dish was such a disappointment we sent it back. The penne in a marinara sauce was mediocre at best.  The highlight of the meal was the bread which was served upon arrival. This was our first visit to East Side Marios and will most likely be our last."}
{"text":"I am usually a fan of east side mario's, however this location was definitely a turn off. 

Where do I start? I guess I will start with the service. We stood waiting to be seated for a while I mean the waitress saw us, smiled and continued on. I guess she wasn't designated to seat us, because the waiter sat us. We needed the gluten free menu so that was another wait took our waitress about 5-10 mins to see us. All in all I am not impressed with the wait times. It took us a while hour to actually get what we ordered. Our waitress was friendly and polite but I ordered a medium cooked steak, about half and inch in thickness. My steak came out rare, so what was the hour wait for? 

I usually go to the Milton location when I visit my family and that is by far the better east side of the 2 u have been too. 

The only thing I liked was the atmosphere of this place. Lighting was great and deco/designs were vibrant and lively."}
{"text":"We went out for dinner at 9pm on a Monday and encountered the worse service I've ever gotten. 

The attraction to east side Mario's is their all you can eat bread and salad. But we had to ask 3 times for bread!

Then they provided us a sangria and FORGOT to put the wine in it. The waitress provided us a glass of wine after most of the pitcher was gone. Don't worry we still got charged for an alcoholic sangria. 

Then we got our food and it was soo dry, no sauce and they mixed up our orders. My aunt was with me and requested mushrooms on her meal but they put the mushrooms in my husbands meal. 

We tried fixing our food ourselves by asking for side of mushrooms and sauce but they took forever to bring it out. 

Terrible service and food all around. Will never go there again."}
{"text":"Went for dinner last Wednesday evening and was pleasantly surprised by an impromptu performance by a magician that the restaurant has hired to entertain the guests when there is a kitchen delay. The server was very attentive and apologized that the kitchen was backed up by a large take out order. A few moments later, we were entertained by a card guessing trick, another where he guessed the name of the person I was thinking of, and some dice guessing games. 

The food arrived shortly afterwards and it was hot and delicious. 

Would gladly go back to this location again. Obviously the management has taken some great steps to amuse the guests in the case of a delay and it was a pleasant way to pass the time."}
{"text":"My rating is 3.5 stars. 

A few weeks ago, our team had our regular eat-out Friday lunch ritual. My manager was on a business trip and asked me to lead this lunch. I did.

There were five of us. It was the last lunch with my two students, for it was their last day with the company. We had two other colleagues join us.

This East Side Marios is roughly a ten-minute drive from my workplace. I didn't realize that there was a Costco behind this restaurant until one of my students had mentioned it. It's funny that she knew that there was a Costco. Ask her where she lives and she has a difficult time (don't ask).

The restaurant is modern when you walk in. I don't often frequent East Side Marios. I simply know the one in Markham and rarely visit it these days.

I ordered a Diet Coke and water. I got a lemon wedge with the latter. I also got the lunch size version of chicken tetrazzini

I liked the warm bread that you get. Slather butter on it and it's yummy. I ended up being the bread carver for a bit.

My chicken tetrazzini was good. My only complaint was that it was too small. I was still hungry that I ended up eating more bread, which I rarely do. I wasn't the only one eating the bread. Eventually, all five of us polished the bread off and ordered even more! I would sooner get the regular size!

It was a nice, casual, leisurely lunch with colleagues. Perhaps it was good that my manager wasn't there that day. We spent two hours chatting and eating!

{"text":"I'm only giving it 1 star for the kind service we received from the super overwhelmed waitress,  otherwise I'd give 0 stars. I went on a Tuesday night with my 2 kids and the place was nearly empty. We were seated upon arrival and were immediately welcomed with a table side magic show. The performer was excellent and he was able to really capture the attention of the kids, it was a nice treat. Once he was done our waitress came and took our order. She was kind, attentive took our order and made recommendations. I could see she was the only waitress on the floor and she was extremely busy. I even saw her making cocktails and preparing beverages as there was no bartender at the bar. We waited over 40 minutes for our food, we didn't even get salad while we waited. When our food arrived it was cold, not lukewarm, cold!
My son order the kid sliders and the beef patties were stiff like hockey pucks. My daughter had the seafood linguine, and I had the new flat iron steak sandwich. All the dishes arrived cold but the 2 meat dishes were dry and hard. I'd never recommend them. We had to ask for the linguine to be warmed up because cold pasta is just too disgusting. 20 minutes after the food arrived we had to remind the waitress to bring the salad. 
I'm very disappointed and sad to say I'll never go back. This was our favourite family restaurant but the past 2 visits have left us highly disappointed which is NOT due to the waiting staff. 
When restaurants cut down on stuff it reflects poorly on their performance and quality of service and since I vote with my money I'm glad to walk away and spend it somewhere else. The GTA is too big a city to waste time in a place that doesn't deserve my money."}
{"text":"Pretty typical east side marios. Food was good, no complaints. Nice and newly built so everything is up to date. Staff was pleasant and friendly. Will probably be back."}
{"text":"The food and service was okay, except they didn't give us the option of soup or salad. They just brought the garden salad to the table. The salad has a weird chalky taste to it. It's not good at all... which was why I wanted the soup. They only gave us two homeloaves and one bowl of salad... so much for unlimited bread and salad. The main course tasted okay, but just like the last time I was there, the aftereffects of the meal were very unpleasant.  I am not likely to return."}
{"text":"Love this place as my son designed the building.  Joked with him saying kinda looks like one of those hockey arenas you played in when you where younger.  #ArchitectureRocks"}
