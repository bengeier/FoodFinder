MAY THE POO BE WITH YOU"}
{"text":"A solid 4-4.5 stars!! I was expecting a meh kind of buffet considering all the reviews I read on here, and coming here was one of the greatest surprises I've had in awhile! We aren't quite buffet connoisseurs, but we do go to buffets on occasion and I think I have a pretty good taste for them. It's true that this buffet is no Bellagio, but sometimes you just don't want to spend $65 per person and 2 hours in line for hand painted chocolate and napa valley focaccia and baby quail, ya know? We got there at about 10:40 am, which I would seriously recommend because you pay the breakfast price ($14.99 per person) and while you are eating your breakfast, they swiftly turn over the entire buffet to the lunch/dinner menu, which you have full access to for no extra charge! It's awesome! Some of the food i was impressed by included ricotta blintzes with strawberry sauce, a full yogurt parfait bar, HUGE selection of pastries, doughnuts, breakfast breads, an even huger selection of lunch/Dinner desserts (I loved the chocolate chip cookies! Crispy and chewy and almost like homemade! And they had real m&ms. Had to take some for the road in a napkin) and lots of roasted meats and veggies. The couple things I'd stay away from: the tortilla chips were kind of stale, the candied yams tasted like the syrup for the French toast. The service was good and speedy, and the guy with the coffee was always eager to keep the mugs full. They had the AC on a little strong, but there are lots of hot foods, so it's okay.  All in all, it wasn't world-class cuisine and probably not as fancy as the Aria or another expensive buffet here in Vegas. But it was tasty, a good selection, and just a really good price! To be completely honest, there is a 95% chance that if I revisit a buffet in Vegas, this one will be above the Bellagio or any other overpriced pretentious buffet on the list. Unlimited food and drinks actually cost me less than huevos rancheros and one drink the previous morning. Good deal to me!"}
{"text":"I ate at The Buffet inside of Westgate 3 times during my 10 day convention stay.  2 dinners and a brunch.  The price was reasonable around $25 for the quality and selections.  The carving station serves great prime ribs and yummy salmon.  Beef ribs were tough but certain pieces were great, roasted pork and ham were nothing to write home about.  The made-to-order pasta and omelette station were one of the very best features here.   The mussels in garlic sauce was to die for.  Crab legs were an excellent addition to the brunch menu.  Excellent fried chicken.  Believe it or not but this place got one of the best hot and sour soup I've tasted in the US. Good selections of desserts.  Pros: quick and convenient, reasonably priced, above average service.   Cons: for the price this is not a bad place."}
{"text":"Brunch was good and I had a table all for myself. The selection for breakfast wasn't anything for me to jump up and down about but being it was walking distance to my hotel it was ok. The eggs needed more time cooking and the pancakes and French toast was not great. The lunch food was superb and dessert. If you really wanted to breakfast you probably would be disappointed but leaning towards lunch it's great."}
{"text":"When and got a 2 for 1 special. Now I'm big and I like to eat. I know my food. This was by far the worst buffet ever.  The orange juice was like water. The corn beef looked like it was so old. The pizza for the kids was hard. Complete waste of money."}
{"text":"This is a smaller buffet setting. Sometimes they have local $6.99 specials which maybe worth the wait in a long @$$ line. Everyone and their baby daddy's cousin is in line.  The taste and quality of the food is a bit disappointing. Definately not worth paying regular price. Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"$18.95 per person....Was really hungry for lunch and didn't want to leave the hotel mid day in Vegas.  Not worth it! Furr's cafeteria or hometown buffet is actually better than this place....REALLY! Don't eat here! Their \"chinese food line was mostly salt; the prime rib is tougher than the sole of my shoe. You'd probably enjoy fastfood better in this instance."}
{"text":"If I could give no star I would. Ate here and went to get tomato slices, noticed the slices had mold I even looked very closely and it was fuzzy green. Told the manager in the front and they took the tray away. Funny part is she told me she ate a moldy piece and it was ok and taste good...wtf...they then brought the same slices out rearranged on another plate....wow..The prime rib was cold and over cooked, the shrimp was old and fishy, the eggs for my salad smelled of freezer frost. They before served Draft beer and house wine included in the buffet cost....well..now they have removed all that and it is an empty station...I was here a month ago while it was lvh and back now that it is westgate. It is very sad how this place went to a turd with ownership changes. Save a buck I guess."}
{"text":"The LVH Champagne Brunch left me with food poisoning. If you must eat here, avoid the eggs benedict and crab legs."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good buffet, and I would have given it a 4 if I hadn't seen their sushi. I was about to pick up some sushi when I noticed it had brown avocado on the inside....Aside from that the rest of the food looked fresh. They have a great salad bar, good soup, deserts, fish, etc. However the golden days of this buffet have passed. When Westgate was LVH, the buffet was excellent. It had crab legs,eggs benedict, smoked salmon, sushi. I have not seen any of that in a couple years at least. Aside from that, this is a good place to eat if you are not expecting to have seafood. They don't have any \"luxury\" items at the buffet but the quality is good, except for the sushi. Cost is $25 for dinner, and a little less for brunch."}
{"text":"Price was reasonable at $19.99. Decent selection. Restaurant was clean and table service attentive (quickly cleared a plate and noticed when I needed drink refills). Food on my Sunday 7:30pm visit was not what I had hoped. Salmon was dry and over cooked. Sushi was limited to one kind of roll on one serving plate; again not what I expected. There was wasabi but no soy sauce or little bowls to mix it that I could see. Spring rolls were not crispy, prime rib was also kind of dry. The beef rib I had was really fatty so it took a lot of manuevering. The salad bar looked good and there was lots of dessert variety. I am willing to concede a Sunday night may not be the best time to dine because the restaurant was not super busy, but I think LVH can do better with their buffet offerings, especially since the massive NAB conference was being hosted at the adjacent convention center and lots of attendees packed the hotel. The following night I ate at the more expensive ($34.95) buffet at the Bellagio, and there was absolutely no comparison: everything was outstanding."}
{"text":"Was the best deal near the Strip for locals, but not anymore. Still it's only $14.99 for dinner with the 25% locals discount, and my Hilton Gold Card allows me to cut the line, although there aren't as many people now.  The shrimps are completely peeled, including tail. Smoked salmon was good quality. Nice salad bar complete with pasta and potato salad. Decent Mexican food, especially the chile rellenos. Hot section had steaks and lamb chops. I usually avoid pre-cooked meats, but these were very juicy for a change. They also had a carving station with prime rib, a small Chinese station, and a nice dessert spread. On top of it all is the free beer and wine included in the price of admission."}
{"text":"Buffet for breakfast and dinner both had a great selection of food... My experience was cold food when should of been hot, California rolls stayed empty long time... Best part of breakfast buffet was LaiLani.. She made experience fun enjoyable.. Sweet lady.."}
{"text":"there were flies flying around row shrimps and oysters, and some dead on them.  i tried the shrimps and oysters anyway and.. as expected  they were stinky and gross..ew  other foods were all mediocre was the first meal upon arriving Vegas and it totally ruined my mood.  total waste of money"}
{"text":"I went at 1pm. There is mostly nothing to choose  from.  For the price 19.99 I would go elsewhere.  This place is on the same level of the Westside cannery Buffett  horrible. The greens were salty but the cornbread was good."}
{"text":"It was decent. Price was affordable, a few bucks under 20 per person. We went for the champagne brunch on Sunday. Pretty good! They don't walk around to refill the champagne glasses, so it was a tad uncomfortable.   There was an omelette bar, crab legs, french toast, prime rib, ribs, pork chops, and a variety of desserts. Our table mates complained about the dry New York steak, but everything was edible.   You'll definitely have a variety of food to eat, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"After being disappointed with Bellagio's buffet, we gave this one a shot for Brunch. Not wait, good selection, decent food, and Champagne included.  Was well worth it. Would go back."}
{"text":"This buffet is not bad it is just incredibly average. The quality and selection you would expect anywhere. The high point was the complimentary beer and wine. The service was very nice."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast and it was good. I think most of the reviews are for dinner and that's not the case with our experience here for breakfast."}
{"text":"They give everybody free breakfast and they don't have the ability to host. Have no choice but to have breakfast somewhere else. This is extremely bad management and disrespectful to the customers."}
{"text":"No selection low quality. Wouldn't returned.  (This was a free meal too). Orange juice horrible I'm wondering where they got it"}
{"text":"This is not one of those fancy buffets in Vegas but food is average and proportional to what you pay. We actually got lucky and found a coupon in our room for a buy one, get one free buffet so my husband and I decided to give it a shot. Went on a Sunday for their brunch. Both of us ate for $25 and couldn't complain."}
{"text":"Pretty much met my expectations, which was quite low. The best thing was the bbq beef ribs, but I expect better quality and selection if I'm paying 20 bucks for dinner at a vegas buffet."}
{"text":"$25 plus tax.   A really small and uninspired selection of low quality food.  There was nothing fresh about the buffet either.   Salad bar consisted of one sad bowl of romaine lettuce - nothing else was fresh."}
{"text":"The quality of the food here really dropped after their remodel. A lot of the food tasted like it's been left there for hours and the selection was mediocre compared to what it was before. They no longer had a wide variety of seafoods or asian cuisine as they did in the past and attempting to eat any the meats was like trying to chew on rubber. I would not recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"Very small buffet selection at big casino buffet prices would be way better off going to golden corral for 1/2 the price and twice the selection."}
{"text":"I don't like buffets because the quality of food is never amazing, but I come here occasionally for breakfast (you can't really mess up bacon.. omelettes..etc) because it is so close to me. Since there are also some lunch items during breakfast time, I somehow always find myself eating here for longer than I should though, because I love crab legs and will eat plates and plates of it. Not just any crab legs though!-- I find it rather annoying when buffets have dinky crab legs that aren't even worth my time/breaking my nails for/possibly fracturing my cherished teeth.. but here I've noticed they're pretty decent size-wise. I also enjoy hoarding all the fresh pineapple/watermelon when they have it.  I wouldn't come here for lunch/dinner (don't like buffets) although sometimes I feel like I can sit there all day and eat crab legs.. but I have heard from a few of my friends that the pasta bar is amazing, and that they go there just for the pasta!  Even though I don't utilize it, there's also a champagne bar for you alchies out there."}
{"text":"This buffet used to good. Though last time i ate here it was the hilton. Food quality is mediocre. Selection is dismal. The only good thing was the pasta station. Even the pepsi machine was a screwup. Filled up a glass with what i thought was water. It had a rootbeer flavor to it. Do yourself a favor and skip this place. I wouldnt come back even if it was free."}
{"text":"First, the name Fresh should be taken off!!! Horrible buffet food.  The rice was not FRESH. The room ribs and the fried chicken was so dry.  Good must have been sitting in the warming containers since the morning.  The only food eatable was the cold shrimp.   Stay away from this place.   Coming from someone who comes to Vegas 3 times a year, I know what I'm talking about."}
{"text":"Wish I could give no stars. $24.00 for horrible cold old food served by an uncaring staff who all seemed to be under paid. But what can you expect from Westgate...."}
{"text":"Gross.  well done prime rib.  unseasoned food.  missing several items that were advertised.  pasta station not open."}
{"text":"This is a buffet of conveyance. The price wasn't bad, they have a decent selection,  but the food wasn't that great. I don't understand how people are giving this place 4 stars on here thats crazy, maybe they know something I don't or caught them on a good day."}
{"text":"Decent variety and price. Sushi no good, rice was not sticky and chewy, and no flavor. Enjoyed the probe rib and salad bar. Italian and Asian choices were not exciting. Service was friendly."}
{"text":"I have never written a review for yelp before or any product for that matter, but I felt compelled to write one for this buffet. It was amazing and grossly underrated. Great and unique selection at a fair price. I don't know what some of the other reviewers were talking about. The food there is excellent and they use quality ingredients. Beef is costlier than pork, but they use beef as opposed to many other buffets. Gyro meat is offered. The lasagna and meatballs are also made out of beef. The pizza is amazing. The prime rib was amazing. You won't be disappointed. I will make sure to eat there every single time I go back."}
{"text":"Meager at best. Will never eat here again. First of all they tell you beer and wine is included with your meal (with a nice selection of imports in the trophy case behind the register). Only to find out all they serve is bud light from a keg and a white and red wine from (presumably) a box. THAT REALLY PISSED ME OFF - if I Hadn't paid first I would have left.  Next, the food was not particularly good. the carving station had some decent meats, but much was over-cooked and dry. There was a fishy funk by the seafood that make me leery of even trying the cooked shrimp. - much less the sushi and raw oysters.  That's my two cents - getting mad all over again thinking of what to write, so I'll stop now."}
{"text":"Now mind you I am not a buffet person. I eat here cause its $5 for locals! Yeah BB! and I am always in the Sport Book which is the best in Vegas. So its a good one stop shop and now is like a second kitchen to me! LOL..   Selection.. honestly.. its about like any other buffet. Not much for asian food and its white people asian food which wasnt my thing. So I am a total creature of habit.. Big salad.. unlimited shrimp.. making a nice shrimp salad.. then a bunch of California rolls.. not bad either.. then a big plate or two of fruits that are in season. Unlimited Pabst Blue Ribbon.. which I think was the first time in my life.. I said \"A Pabst Please\". LOL. Overall it cant be touched for $5 and they have some of the hottest wasabi I have ever had. Its odd as the Asian food selection is not good, but the wasabi is? Mystery... anyhow they also have a good red thai chile sauce to spice things up. So overall.. I am in..  I dont do desserts, but if you did it looks like they have a big selection of cakes, pies etc."}
{"text":"I saw the reviews and figured it could not have been as bad a some people made it out to be but..... For the price of $25 it was awful.  Limited selection and what was there was not appealing at all. Over breaded everything, limited salad bar and side dishes. Carved Meats selection looked OK but did not make up for the rest."}
{"text":"They don't lose stars for the 1.5 hour line we had to stand in. But it should be noted that you should expect to stand in line at least 90 minutes. It should also be noted I am not seduced by buffets. These things being said this buffet was really just ok. They have a large area of food to choose from. But much of it is side dishes or condiments. There is a lot of pasta and all of the food was very salty. The rack of lamb was the best. The crab legs were nice because they were split already for you. But most of the 10-15 legs my table consumed were bad and occasionally someone would proclaim they found a good one or totally put one down because it was too salty to eat. I had hoped for a wider variety of seafood but they seem to rest on their shellfish and forget fish fillets are good too or maybe fish pasta or fish friggin anything but a crusty leg or shrimp cocktail. There are only two types of salads (ceasar and mixed greens) and no extra salad veggies or toppings. The clam chowder soup was surprisingly edible. The desert area is very well stocked with cupcakes, ice cream, sugar free and not sugar free cakes and a crepe station.   Overall I was really disappointed I starved myself and waited in line to overpay for salty average food."}
{"text":"Had a complementary breakfast this morning 6/20/17 for staying at the hotel room. Food was good, server was a little slow..walked past us several times and everytime she seen our cups were empty but didnt say anything till we asked for them but always came to the table next to us ???. Not much choices and we expected to see more. But other than that food was ok."}
{"text":"For the price, the buffet isn't all around bad. Especially if the buffet tickets come with a room package.  Straight to the point, and easy to please to a group of rumbling stomachs' point of view.   Raw oysters are offered. They are not as plump as they would be when they are in season, but luckily they were fresh and did not cause any diarrhea.   You'll find all the regulars here such as cocktail shrimps, salad bar, a small deli of carved meats, and of course vegaslized Chinese food.  Penne with a combination of alfredo and marinara sauce is a must-try. The dessert section is small, but the bread pudding and gigantic chocolate covered strawberries are worth mentioning. I love the mozzarella medallions.  Yes, there is a free wine and beer bar. The wine is better when it is mixed with apple juice.  A really funny guy tending to that area is greatly astounded if he thinks that you don't look your age. I received a Chinese I love you in the process."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful buffet dinner here on my trip to las vegas with hubby while attending the convention outside the hotel this is also where we stayed for 4 days. We drove almost 5 hrs and very hungry so we decided to try there fresh buffet since we are not familiar of the places in vegas and driving around is not worth since we just came in. We were greeted with smiling staff from the entrance and we paid the dinner kinda pricey but what the heck were hungry, we sat and a server came in to us very friendly and entertainer his name is Idriss he gave us his card name and then i said oh they have a yelp okey absolutely we will say something nicer to this buffet and the server he was so good to us and always come and see how we are doing and what else we need, etc you name it and one thing is he is smiling you feel relax and at home. Food was great the only thing is i cant eat much as i want too but hey there fresh salad was absolutely delicious and the artichoke salad and the prime rib was so tender and juicy. We tried there breakfast too the day we checked out food is great also. Definitely we will come back again here next years convention."}
{"text":"It's a buffet not a 5 star steakhouse but even taken with a grain of salt this buffet is way below par. A buffet usually gives a fairly ok roast but not here. Two slices from two separate roasts and I could literally not cut them. The crab legs look and taste gross and the eggs taste more like powdered egg product than egg. Tried the stir fry and it had no flavor. Why anyone has waitresses at a buffet I don't know but these ones are inattentive and gross. The orange pork was good as were the breadsticks, but I've still had better 8.99 buffets in Vegas and this one comes in more than double that ESP after the mystery taxes and fees. Skip it, even hung over"}
{"text":"You know, you can count on Hilton.  I have travelled professionaly at various points in my career and have been through a LOT of hotel buffets.  This was the best breakfast buffet I have had in Vegas.  First, no line.  Which, having once waited over an hour for the buffet at Paris, was nice.  Nothing that i have not had on a hundred other buffets, but everything was fresh and well done.  Nice selection without being ridiculous.  Could have used a bit more fruit.  Added bonus, the monorail stops here, so if you are staying somewhere more midstrip, it is an easy ride.  Yes, not bad would be the phrase....."}
{"text":"Another fail for this stay at Westgate. Posted everywhere of its times then my family and I get down there. ..\"Sorry...well be back in 2 days.\""}
{"text":"The buffet is beginning to be lower in standards. I have been coming here for a few years already because I usually stay here and get the promotion deal, which gives you two free buffets for breakfast, lunch, or dinner...(Used to be six when it was with Las Vegas Hilton.)   The selection here is not so great. There is Chinese, BBQ, Hispanic, American, salad bar, desserts, and fruit selection. We came for the Sunday Brunch and the only good thing that I liked was the unlimited mimosas, even though, the champagne may be cheap, but I liked it a lot and the server was very sweet. The prime rib was a bit dry and bland to me and kind of tough to eat. The mac and cheese tasted like powder. The snow crabs didn't look fresh, so I didn't touch it. The smoked salmon was fresh and tangy. The omelette was very fresh and great! However, I felt bad because I saw a lot of people had burnt omelettes except myself. =/ The fruit was too ripe and started to break apart. The soft serve ice cream was watered down! Do not get this! The desserts had too much whip cream and also coconut...so I couldn't eat any of it...  The service here was terrific, they were very attentive and I would give them four stars for this!  Overall, I have to admit that because I ate here for free, it was ok. But overall, I wouldn't prefer eating here. I love Wynn Buffet! =)"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of this buffet.  I had edible Chinese food and steak.  Peeled shrimp was not good but I went here because it was next to a CES venue.  Skip the mashed potatoes.  The sushi is not okay."}
{"text":"Not a huge selection of food, nothing in particular was top notch, the food was ok but we were starving and it was complimentary, so you can't beat free right? Service was great"}
{"text":"I used to come here when i was working at LVCC on trade shows and it was the Hilton. Two ownership/name changes later, higher prices, no free booze and average buffet food. I had Brunch right when it opened so food was  fresh. Nothing spectacular. A little pricey for what I had, but about the same as the cafe for less food, less choice and probably about the same quality."}
{"text":"Las Vegas and buffets are synonymous.  Sometimes I wish this buffet didn't exist due to the McDonald's quality that it offered.  The ONLY reason why I even ate here because I was with my family for a convention as well as my uncle picking up the tab.  For $20 this buffet was subpar compared to the others.  Makes Hometown Buffet feel upscale and trendy compared to this place.  Fried shrimp was small, but ok.  Sausage was dry as a bone.  Hopefully the breakfast should be different once I come back.  The buffet at the Palace Station s**ts on LVH.  SMH."}
{"text":"For a buffet it is great. Pricing wasn't horrible, selection was better than average, cashiers, hostesses and waitstaff were pleasant and attentive."}
{"text":"One star only because I couldn't select less. The only highlight was the service. The staff kept the table clear and the drinks full. As for the food, the two best items there were the obviously frozen shrimp and the grape leaves. The mac and cheese had a half inch of grease on the top of the pan, pasta was \"cooked to order\" but the guy who prepared it filled the pan with oil and then proceeded to BURN all of it. The dessert bar had nothing but cut up pastries from a big box store and sloppy pans of \"cobbler\". Next time I'll hit the chain buffet or fast food. Thanks but no thanks."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst buffet I have ever been to. I came on a Friday night and it costed $25 per person. They have a VERY small selection of food. I walked around to see what's good and nothing looked appetizing to me. The food also tasted very bland. So I thought this meal was a waste of money since I made myself eat something to fill up my stomach. However the waitress was pretty good. She constantly refilled our drinks. But just save your money and go somewhere else for better food. Definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and I thought it was ok for the price ($20).   You get a variety of breakfast items ranging from the typical bacon and scrambled eggs to mini steaks and oatmeal. I preferred the breakfast items over lunch aside from the prime rib which was appetizing. The addition of doughnuts as a dessert item impressed me even though it was rather floury.   Service was good; the staff cared enough to ensure my cup of orange juice was full or if wanted more coffee.   Going here after a long night out on the strip will no doubt hit the spot. I'd come again in a heartbeat just for breakfast."}
{"text":"I regretted coming here the moment I had paid. While I love a high quality buffet, this definitely wouldn't fall under that category. There was nothing that set it apart from any other \"Sunday brunch\" buffet anywhere in the country. By that I mean the food was below average and the décor was very meh."}
{"text":"I was here for a convention and grabbed a quick lunch at the Westgate's buffet between meetings.   Quite disappointing - more like a truck stop grade buffet than what I expect in a large Vegas hotel.   If you need to eat quickly and can't get to another location I suppose you can survive on this food - but it was all bland, over cooked and unappealing.   The beef was so dry I couldn't eat it - I'm not even sure what cut of meat it was (brisket maybe??).   If I had it to do over again I would have bought a protein bar and a packaged salad at the lobby store....."}
{"text":"For the price you pay, I've seen much better buffets.  Very hard to recommend this to anyone, unless ur feeling lazy and want to go to a LV buffet if ur staying at the Hilton.  Buffet in general is small, although selection is quiet large, but again, the food is just meh."}
{"text":"Vegas and buffets go hand in hand and this all-you-can-eat awesomeness is satisfactory for anyone staying at LVH. My boyfriend and I ate at The Buffet twice, once for breakfast ($14.99) and once for their Champagne Brunch ($19.99). I'm a breakfast lover so I was in heaven with all the choices...eggs various styles, bacon, sausage, ham, biscuits, gravy, french toast, pancakes, potatoes, grits, oatmeal, fruit, cereal, desserts, etc. Was it the BEST quality buffet ever...not so much BUT it was good nonetheless. The Champagne Brunch was a bit more impressive, as it should be for $5 more. Unlimited champagne/mimosas, however, I wished they would have served them to us instead of having to go get them from the bartender each time. The buffet included all the breakfast food PLUS chicken, beef, ribs, Asian food, veggies, cold crab legs, etc.   Not the biggest buffet or the fanciest but no complaints. If I stay at the LVH again I would hit up The Buffet for sure! :)"}
{"text":"This place is honestly not worth the $25 comp. I've eaten here a few times and at most of the buffets in town. The selection is very limited: pasta station carving station Italian and Chinese sections salad bar and desserts. All are of mediocre quality AT BEST with the pasta station being the best part of this place since it's made fresh. Absolutely do not pay to eat here."}
{"text":"Las Vegas. Shows, gambling, sensations, and stuff yourself senseless buffets before waddling back to the slot machines and gambling for hours because you're in too much of a food haze to move.  It's not quite like that. Saturday brunch was the biggest letdown of the food I had in Vegas. The crab legs looked fine, but they tasted a bit dodgy and triggered the \"Back off this seafood\" instinct. You know the one. (Upside- No ill effects) BBQ pork rib that was mostly a lump of fat around a bone with a tiny strip of meat to pluck off. The bacon had the decency to not be paper thin, but it did twirl around my fork like overcooked pasta. They offered eggs Benedict which might have been passable for a buffet, but would not have passed muster with any decent restaurant. Petite NY steak was mostly gristle.  Perhaps my expectations were a bit higher given that this was a Vegas buffet. Perhaps it was a $19.99 price tag that left me wanting something just a bit better. I do know I expected a step up from Golden Corral. I didn't get that in any way. Even the people watching was rather dull compared to the rest of the hotel.  Don't bother with this one. The ingredients are so low quality that nothing can save it."}
{"text":"Standard breakfast items and then some...fried chicken, grilled beef cuts, and I think I saw seafood sitting around as well during an 8am opening.  The food was good...I especially liked the French toast and the scrambled eggs which were fluffy as can be.  The one annoyance I had was when tipping the cashier she insisted I do not tip on the receipt and leave cash on the table instead because it would require her more work to print a new receipt with the tip on it.  She forgot the whole \"what if the customer doesn't have cash\" scenario.  Overall the food was good though."}
{"text":"After coming back to NY, I still remember this place. It wasn't very good. The line to order fresh eggs is too slow. I think hotels should really check their short order cooks because they would either make it or break it. On top of that the selections from the buffet was just so-so, nothing to brag about. Hope they'll improve. We came here with hubby's friend uncle. He lives in Vegas. He wasn't impressed either. Funny thing is that he usually takes us to a smaller hotel to join him for a buffet breakfast or lunch and it turned out the place he likes to go is so much better but not as famous."}
{"text":"To be honest our stay here was so awful maybe I was a bit jaded by the time we had lunch here. We got to the buffet for lunch at 11 AM when it was supposed to start. Didn't have a long wait in line and we seated quickly. When going up most the serving stations were either empty or sill had breakfast items which is fine they are switching over. They have a pretty good chicken fried steak for breakfast I admit. Service to get drinks and plates cleared was pretty spotty considering at the time it was just my husband and I and two other tables in the section. After about half an hour to 45 minutes they finally had lunch started but only the Asian station and a meat station not many sides available and the taco bar was still empty as was the salad bar. The carved turkey was decent but my husbands prime rib was tough and way to rare. It was a so so buffet but at least it was comped I wouldn't recommend it to anyone on what I saw and ate"}
{"text":"The worst dinner buffet I've ever had. Nothing is good and fresh here. For $27, I'm sure you can get a better buffet somewhere in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Food was bland. Only offered complimentary beer for dinner. Vanilla soft serve didn't work. Crappy selection. Do not eat here!"}
{"text":"Very average. But was free so didn't care. Would not pay for this, tough. Small selection and low quality. Was filling but with so many options in the city... Will probably only go if starving and free. Not horrible but just not really special. Although, new owners might change that. Haven't been there since the change."}
{"text":"After dropping my wife to work, I came to the Westgate to collect some money from one of my winning sports bet tickets i made a week earlier. I was hungry and decided to eat breakfast here. First off, I thought the entrance looked nice and so did the tables. Now, when I went to the buffet, it looked very ordinary and unfortunately not very clean. The spread had your typlcal eggs, rice, sausage, bread, and fruit. The only things I saw unique were the lox and bagels. There are 3 main reasons I gave this place one star. 1) They don't have a cook-to-order omelette station. 2) My pet peeve for buffets is never serve cereal. And guess what? Remember those small boxes of cereal that you used to buy in an 8 or 10 pack (i.e. frosted flakes, cheerios, rice krispies, etc.) Yea, they got it. 3) It is NOT WORTH $19 and some change! You can go to Main street station in downtown and pay $8.64 for a better breakfast...AND they got an cook-to-order omelette station!"}
{"text":"Staff gets 5 stars! Food not so much. Had the pasta bar and the white sauce was not fresh."}
{"text":"We usually go here on Mondays and Wednesdays for the $5 dinner locals special but i believe you have to use player's points not just $5 cash. Regular dinner price is around $20 which is the norm for a most vegas dinner buffets but because its $5 i call it a steal.  Best buffet i been to under $30. Especially if you see what you get.  Oysters, not always the best of quality but eat enough and you could definitely eat $20 worth. We tend to eat plates of them. Also add some sushi, sashimi style salmon, and shrimp.  Made to order Pasta dishes, i always tip them because they make, in my mind, the best tasting pasta dishes. Even better then all of the fancy pasta restuarants i've tried.  Add some artichokes and bread sticks.  Coffee and chipotle crusted Prime Rib is probably the deal breaker.  Just get there before i do for those tender pieces. I'll save you some unless im hungry they're all mine.  Real delicious salmon, bbq ribs, lamb, steak, hotwings, tacos, fajittas, desserts, the bread pudding, dried fruits, beer and wine, good selection of salad, etc.  is it monday yet.   Came here after one of the last awards shows and they brought out the good stuff."}
{"text":"Yelp 2017 100 Challenge: 2017 Review 42/100  As a buffet in Las Vegas, the food provided is below the standard expected. However, the price is cheaper than other buffets. Also, the hotel provides a $10 voucher for each day that you decline room service. For that price, it is a decent buffet."}
{"text":"The Buffet inside of the Las Vegas Hilton used to have some of the best prices for locals. Those have disappeared and won't be coming back anytime soon, which is a huge shame. I like to vote for venues with my hard earned dollar and as a long time local, I used to visit the Las Vegas Hilton Buffet several times a month. I was a true customer in the sense that I would also talk about the food offerings to friends and people visiting Las Vegas from afar. This won't be happening any longer as I no longer go here.  The last time I visited the Buffet, which was several months ago, it had a pretty good BBQ meat station, Mexican station, Asian food station, excellent planked salmon, oysters, shrimp salad, a meat station and sometimes crepes at the dessert station. That's a lot of stations, but they are centrally located in the buffet.  Hopefully the free beer and wine is still going on here and the friendly hostess staff is still helping people find seats. But without the locals deal, I'm sure they have had a lot less business."}
{"text":"This place stinks, literally.   Like the rest of the hotel, this restaurant is falling apart. At $26 for brunch, this buffet is about a 1/4 of the size and about 1/10 of the quality of any other hotel buffet out here.   Don't eat here"}
{"text":"Don't fool yourself Westgate, you hyped your renovation as a big deal but the saying goes, \"You can drizzle sprinkles and drip tons of chocolate sauce on crap...but in the end, it's still crap!\" My family and I have been long time patrons of this casino. Ever since we've started with Hilton, all the way up till today's owners. As new ownership took over, the buffet has suffered TREMENDOUSLY!!!  Days not too long ago, you could find a wide selection of different foods from pasta meats, poultry, and seafood. Now all you have is overly salted chicken, cold crab, and hit or miss prime rib. Sure you have a generic Chinese food section but that too is severely limited to chow mein n mussels being the most eattable. I thought I'd might be too over the top with my gripes, but when you see the line of guests going in a small circle mumbling \"Is this it???\" well then I finally confirmed my assessment as just. My family and I were bitter as heck when we experienced this but I can only imagine how bad the out of towners felt paying full price. Heck it was so bad that the majority of the people I saw didn't go for seconds. But hey, this hotel or establishment if you want to call it has had every area of business hit rock bottom. They won't care though. Pushing their timeshares and packages on you are their real concern. $25? Save yourself the pain and gripe by spending an extra 5 on a real buffet . Westgate doesn't care about what you think about their buffet and lastly they for sure don't care about us locals who support the little business they have....GOOD RIDDANCE!!!"}
{"text":"$22/dinner per person  NYE wkend and this place was a ghost town, was it a sign? Yes.  The food is yuck and comparable to Sizzler.   They have Mexican, Asian and American food.   Shrimps for the cocktail was disgusting. I put a piece in my mouth and that stuff would not break apart. It's like they froze, thawed and froze thawed it all over again. Bf and I had to spit it out.  The dessert station had plenty of options but most is processed cold and not very good.   They do offer unlimited beer and wine. I had the house white and it was not tastey at all.   Sorry LVH but the food needs a good fixing. The meats offered did not look very good either. I had the prime rib which tasted like it came out of a crock pot, more  like a stew meat, color was off and texture was flakey rather than chewy and med rate.  I do not recommend coming here."}
{"text":"I'll make this review short and simple. The food for dinner, which was $25.00 (Tuesday), was below average at best. Very little selection. The only average food that they had to offer was a cut of ham and a pan seared salmon. They had like an overused oil fried chicken, bad tasting salad etc. Other than that, the food didn't look very appealing and the taste was really bad."}
{"text":"This was truly an excellent breakfast fresh  egg white  omlett not out of a container. And our server Chris Epicico at the buffet was spot on, delivering fresh coffee at the right time as needed. He was constantly checking to make sure our experience at Fresh was eceptional."}
{"text":"Pretty good for a cheap Vegas buffet. Cleaned good size shrimp, ok prime rib and all u can drink beer and wine included!"}
{"text":"We have gone here for breakfast every day of our week long stay in the LVH for breakfast.  We came here because we opted-out of housekeeping each day, took out our own trash, and got a $10 voucher for use at any food locations in the hotel.  I cannot say how the lunch and dinner is, but the breakfast is pretty decent.  I was surprised to see an omlette station where they will also cook eggs to order, sirloin steak cooked on a grill, good corned beef hash, and lox.  Granted things like the lox aren't the freshest most delicious ever, but it wasn't too bad.  If it weren't for the coupon, we probably wouldn't go, but with the coupon, I think it was a good breakfast deal. If you will be coming for a few days, find \"your waitress\", tip her well, and keep coming back to his/her section each day for excellent service."}
{"text":"Food was bad, everything seemed stale or old. We got buy one get one free and I was upset that we paid at all. $20 is way to steep per person for what they serve. Skip the disappointment and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"It was Ok.  Was too hungry to wait at the Bellagio 1 hour buffet line so came over to Aria and had no wait.  They served Lobster which was cold by the time we got it and the food was just ok.  Some hit and misses.  Shrimp/Dessert/some chinese food were delicious.  Other things were just ok or bad like the overcooked fish.  I expected better from a $40 buffet and explains why the place had no wait and plenty of openings during dinner."}
{"text":"As far as buffets go, it was decent for the $24 brunch admission price. Coffee was tasty and all you can drink champagne for brunch on Saturday-Sunday. The breakfast brunch foods were better than most (eggs Benedict, lox and bagels, French toast, omelette bar) and everything was clean and presentable. Our waiter was super attentive and we never had an empty coffee cup or champagne flute."}
{"text":"Located inside the Hilton hotel, you get a free buffet here if you stay at this hotel. One per person. I really enjoyed the food here. They have a lot of variety especially for a buffet that gives out coupons to their guests, I wouldn't expect too much from it, but the food was pretty good! They also give free champagne! How awesome is that?   There are lots of variety of yummy hot foods, a salad bar with smoked salmon!!! ahhh so delicious!, and a large variety of desserts! They have chocolate covered strawberries also, but you have to ask the pastry chef to bring it out to you because they keep it in the fridge.  Definitely dont mind staying here again for the buffet."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend enjoyed our breakfast here. There is a lot of selections. $17.30 for 2. Cant beat that! Got April help us in the front and she is so nice. And Bette, our server is awesome. Ate here before for lunch on a weekend when we attended sema convention and it was ok since we came in at 2:30 pm so food are not fresh but we gave it a try today and it turned out great!"}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast and they had food that you could eat for lunch as well. The service was great and their array of Asian food was delicious as well. I will definitely be back here. I used my vegasslots points and got a buy one get one free. So it ended up to be about 12 dollars for 2 people which was the best part."}
{"text":"DONT EAT HERE!!!!  I wish I can give this place negative 5 stars but I can't! There was a piece of broken glass in Spanish rice and guess what I chomped down on it! Chipped my tooth and got an apology and incident report. Unacceptable they did not even bother to return my money that I spent. I complained to a Hilton mgr but since I purchased my room through expedia they could not do anything, so now I am in my hotel room in pain trying to get a prescription filled from my Dr in Los Angeles."}
{"text":"What a disappointing buffet!!!    Stopped here for lunch while out in Vegas for the CES/AVN shows.    Selection of food was just ok and the quality was terrible.   Some of the food was cold.    As I sat at my table, I watched as people would go up to the dessert station, look around for a while and then walk away with nothing.   Terrible selection of desserts."}
{"text":"The Fresh Buffet is a very nice restaurant.  My server IDRISS, was wonderful.  He made sure everyone in my party of 8 was very well taken care of.  Because of him I have to give The Fresh Buffet 5 stars."}
{"text":"Had breakfast this morning. We upgraded our room at checkout and got complimentary buffet tickets. I got to say according to the reviews i saw,  i didnt think i was gonna like this place but i loved it. I was surprised at how good it was. The steak was beautifully cooked. The omelette was delicious and the twice cooked potatoes were d delicious too. Would definitely go again"}
{"text":"The Casino and Hotel is now Westgate, the buffet is 100% horrible!!! I felt offended the front desk gave me a two person buffet comp after I had a room mishap. The food was cold, looked questionable and was tasteless! The counters in front of food was dirty, reached to have carving station veggies and gunk from the window edge slimmed on my arm uugghh! Disgusting! Went over to the italian section and all the utensils were greasy and slimey! Don't ever waist a dime or your time on this dump! One star because I cant do no star!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't come from a long way to eat here but I would walk 15 minutes. I am actually very grateful that this place exist, If you are at a big convention at LVCC next door, this is the best, quickest and cheapest food you can get within a 30 minutes walking radius. Especially easy to access when using Joe W. Brown drive and entering though the Sports Book area."}
{"text":"The help is awful, rude and the food is sub-par at best. If you order one of the bottomless drinks they will tell you 2-3 times they will bring another before they actually do. My waitress brought a root beer to our table and then we decided to do a tea instead, she tried to take the drink off our table and give it to another table, even after we told her we drank out of it. Then she was mad at us. Talk about a health code violation. If I wasn't stuck here for a tournament being held in the hotel I would have left and got my money back."}
{"text":"Your below average Las Vegas buffet.  stale food and poor selection, but a lot it.  it is what it is.  If you literally have exhausted all other food options come here."}
{"text":"So my boyfriend and I were hungry and decided to check out the buffet. Seating was quite fast which is a plus.We sat down and I told him to go check things out first. He came back with a piece of meat and a few other things. Nothing worth noting. I then took my turn and was totally disappointed with the choices but more disappointed in how unappetizing everything was. I came back with a piece of chicken, a mini taco ( the only thing that looked appealing out of the whole buffet) and some Mac & Cheese. My boyfriend took one bite out of his meat and spit it out. It was ALL fat. I took a bite out of the mac and cheese and felt like i wanted to vomit! Everything was DISGUSTING!  to put it simply. I knew from the price not to expect much but to literally felt sick after.   I meant it was a complete waste of time, I will never ever go back there. I have never had such a bad experience at a Buffet before and now that I think about it, it's no wonder they give out so many comp coupons.... they NEED ppl to eat there.  Word to the wise your better off going to the little sports deli or the paradise cafe."}
{"text":"This buffet is garbage. Easily the worse buffet I have ever eaten at. Very small selection but it didn't really matter as everything there was terrible. We got there at 1pm, they close at 2 and the only thing I can imagine is that they decide to not put fresh food out after 1. Everything was bad, even the salad bar with its like 5 choices of things. the ranch dressing was the horrible watery stuff you see at denny's. The layout is even terrible. the place was a mess, the food trays were a mess. jeez what a disaster. feel bad for my server he seemed like a nice guy and was on top of keeping our table clean (pretty easy no second trip for food it was all so bad) and our glasses full.   I know not every hotel values their buffets as much as the next but this should be embarrassing to the management at Westgate. It is right next to \"the largest sportsbook in the world\" and you can tell that the fast food joints around it are better."}
{"text":"Went here because they had a sign that there was a brunch, turns out it's only Saturday and Sunday. The food was cafeteria like for $18 each. Good service from our waiter. You're killing me LVH with your restaurants, Benihanas was the only awesome restaurant. We are going elsewhere right now for dinner."}
{"text":"For the price there was not much to choose from, it was about $45 for two people lunch, and it was a quarter size of normal buffets in Vegas. The selection was pizza, pasta or Chinese food. Wasn't worth it to me at all. The food was good tho."}
{"text":"The only reason I went to the Hilton Buffet (dinner) was because my uncles invited me and were paying... with that said, I got what I paid for.   The food selection is mediocre.  I definitely was able to get anything worth eating in one round.  The prime rib was super rare, and the chef did not give me an option of having something a little more cooked.  Everything on my plate was splashed with blood. ugh. gross.  I will give them mad props for their sausage though - that ish was BOMB.   Our server was quick, but inefficient.  I asked for water at least 3 times and he missed my initial drink order for my friend...even though he repeated it to me. -__-   Overall, it's okay.  Apparently, locals get dinner for $8, so in that sense, it's worth it, but I wouldn't pay the regular price for it...not at all."}
{"text":"I do not recommend this place. There's not a large variety in food. The food does not taste that great. Plus, some of the plates were still dirty when I picked them up from the buffet area."}
{"text":"Had a two for one coupon and ate breakfast. It's not bad but not great either. For the price (17 bucks for 2 breakfasts), I can't complain. Selection very basic, including corned beef hash (canned), biscuits and gravy, eggs both scrambled and poached, grits, cream of wheat, donuts and pastry selections, fresh fruit, pancakes, cinnamon rolls, chicken fried steak, and an omelette station. Everything tasted pretty fresh, and again the selection is weak, but you get what you pay for and I relatively enjoyed it. Beverage server slow, which was disappointing considering it was a tuesday morning, but all in all a decent place to fi up before the drinking starts. Would I go back? As long as I have a coupon.  Just stay away from the cheese platter and lox. The lox was way chewy and cheese cubes were warm."}
{"text":"The Service was good, Minh was attentive and cleared plates while we were gone. The food was good except for my eggs were cold and rubbery. Also the line looked like it hadn't been filled since opening. Very slim pickings. Definitely not that much bang for your buck"}
{"text":"We ended up waking up late but still managed to eat their breakfast/brunch menu at around 2pm. The place was clean and the staff was friendly. The food was nothing out of the ordinary; normal everyday breakfast/lunch options. If your not wanting to go to the strip or anywhere else to eat, the Fresh Buffet is a good option."}
{"text":"The one star is for the service that was top notch for a buffet. The no stars are for the horrible food they serve. I'm a local so I eat there with a comp from the sports book. If I had to pay I'd be very upset as the food is pretty gross. The 2 things that are good are the freshly made omelet and the prime rib. One night they had crab legs and they smelt really bad to the point I couldn't eat them. The salad at the salad bar tends to be on its last leg. Everything kinda looks like it's been sitting out for a long time. Don't pay for this one not even if it's the last food on the planet"}
{"text":"If you're hung over, this is a great \"average\" buffet. The food isn't anything to write home about, but they have a decent variety. To be honest, the first day I came here I was really hungry (and sober), and the next morning I came hear I was severely hung over - so I averaged my two scores for this review (it should actually be a 2.5)  If you've been to typical buffets, like Souplantation, Izzys, Fresh Choice, Hometown Buffet, etc, then you've been to \"The Buffet\" - it's the same quality and selection. Nothing to write home about, but not a hole in the wall either.   You can get everything from breakfast foods like eggs benedict (which my brother and dad loved) and bacon to dinner items like roast beef (freshly cut), ribs, and crab legs (not great quality crab legs though).   The Hilton is located so far away from everything else that they can get away with this average buffet. Nobody wants to travel 20 minutes to get a better buffet unless they're already out at the strip or craving a nice buffet dinner (I came here around 12pm both times)."}
{"text":"Not much selection and service is poor not sure why they charge so much for dinner but luckily I got comp. I would not be happy if I had to pay so much for so little. But not many choices in the Westgate so if you don't have a car and don't want to head out then you are stuck eating this, everything else in this hotel is just as bad and expensive."}
{"text":"By far the WORST buffet I have ever been to.  How can a 4star Hotel like WestGate allowed this to happen is beyond comprehension.  The name is Fresh Buffet but nothing in there is fresh.   Prime Rib was chalk-dry.  Shrimp cocktail smelled like it has gone bad and slimmy.  That was the last draw for me.  Absolutely horrible."}
{"text":"Ok maybe it's because it was free for us (comped by management), but I really, really liked this buffet, and don't understand all the detractors! I've been coming to Vegas since I was a little girl and hence have consumed an awful lot of buffets over the years -- including an awful lot of awful buffets!!!  So granted, while the Wynn or the Bellagio may have the best buffets, they are also 2-3x the price of this place.  And even if we hadn't been comped, I still would have gladly paid the $19.99 for the champagne brunch.  Everything was fresh, and well stocked, and there was a good variety of items to choose from.  Their prime rib was one of the better ones I have had at a buffet, and they had meaty whole snow crab legs versus those that have been cracked in half like at some other buffets around town.  The only thing missing was the shrimp cocktail, which I love.  Otherwise they had good fried chicken, and different grilled meats and vegetable which were also all good. Apparently at dinner they do have the shrimp tails as well as fresh oysters on the half shell and sushi selections, as well as unlimited wine and beer.  So that's what we will try next time if we stay here again.  Especially if comped again! (Hint! Hint!)"}
{"text":"Ate at the Westgate hotel convention center buffet last night around 5 p.m.   Folks!!  I love buffets. I love food and it doesn't have to be gourmet. That said, never have I tasted such dry, horrible food, EVER!!  I literally choked on the beef and turkey. When the salad is the best item there, you know I mean what I say. I thought the price of $19.99 was great --until my husband and I started to eat. Learn from our mistake!  I gave it one star because the people were so nice."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the buffet.  Now, I was comped all my meals here, so given that they were \"free\", I don't think I would pay $20 rather than head to a restaurant for that price.  This place is right next to the sports book towards the back end of the hotel.  I am not huge on buffets, so I don't really have much to compare as far as Vegas hotel buffet's go, but I would guess this would have what you would expect at a decent buffet.  Without getting into specifics, I don't think most people come specifically for the buffet at the Hilton.  You are either staying here and don't feel like going anywhere or...no, you are staying here if you are eating at their buffet.  PS: I broke their cardinal rule of not taking food from the buffet.  I stole a couple cookies...thank you Hilton Buffet."}
{"text":"Who knew you could go to a buffet and lose weight by not eating!  Such is the case with \"The Buffet\" at the Westgate!  Thank goodness the buffet was a comp...but really that was too much!  I don't think they could even give this so called food away...yet they charge $24.99 for unsuspecting guests.    Let's dig into the \"meat\" of the review.  Typical of a Buffet they offer several different cuisine's of the world...American, Italian, Chinese etc.  they had so called Prime Rib...but it was topped with a type of teriyaki crust that totally masked the flavor.  How about fried chicken...dried out and tough!  Or how about the chicken Marsala...undercooked and raw.  Hum...what is that Chinese soup...crusted over because it was not stirred.  We left the buffet hungry...when has that ever happened!  Bottom line...don't go...even if it is free!"}
{"text":"Get the 2 for 1 with player card!  Great selection for breakfast and helpful staff.  Food is above average for a Vegas buffet.  Can't wait for lunch!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for brunch today.   It was 19.99 per person plus champagne (unlimited).   We had a free voucher which is why we checked it out. I ate a little bit of everything - bacon, sausage, ribs, steak, salad, fruit, buscuits and gravy, ice cream - you get the idea.   The food, like at many buffets, was not the best but it wasn't awful.  I wanted something from the carving station but they only had one person working behind the counter who was making omelets and was not paying attention to the carving line which was growing. They have waiters that get your drinks for you who were very attentive and friendly.   I think if champagne wasn't included, the price would have been too much and not worth it."}
{"text":"Definitely not the best buffet in Vegas, but when you don't really have any other places to go..it'll do.   Options are alright..I did like the grilled veggies, but unfortunately they tasted like crapola.   They had an omelette bar in the morning, and then pasta at night. The pasta was bleck. Mine wasn't made all the way through, and it was still warm. I got a bad tummy ache later on that night.  The ice cream machine served delicious ice cream though. With some crumbled up butterfinger on the side. YUM."}
{"text":"When we arrived and checked in the front desk Person named Dee gave us two complimentary breakfast buffet tickets that were valid from 8am-2pm and we went at 9:30am and waited five minutes and were seated. It said $12/person on our receipt. I assume this was already included in the hotel room stay but others also had a voucher as well. For a free buffet I was impressed with the cleanliness, the organization, the service and the food as well. Not a broad option but enough options for breakfast to satisfy you to get more than one plate."}
{"text":"Some of the worse food I've ever eaten.  Anyone who says they love this food must be accustomed to eating garbage.  I'm sorry but it sucks.  The mashed potatoes taste like instant potatoes out of a box. The desserts taste like they've been in the freezer.  The roast beef was dry and chewy.  Everything tastes the same, flavorless. No way is this worth $25.  Spend your money elsewhere.  It does not taste fresh.  Standard cafeteria food at nice restaurant prices."}
{"text":"This is the most reasonable Sunday brunch buffet on Saturday or Sundays, $25 for adults with tax included. All you can eat steak, omelets,  crab, salmon,  just to name a few. The price had gone up, but what hasn't. Westgate resorts took over from LVH, so far the same. Side nite; not sure how long the status quo will last, but for now it's a good buffet next to the sports page.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Very nice people and service (Miuli in particular). Fresh food for Saturday brunch. Love smoked salmon, Mexican sweet corn (w/butter and spices, yum!) Great breakfast food!"}
{"text":"I went here for dinner, so it was $21.99 per person. I also came in with mighty low expectations based on the reviews here, so that might have helped. That and I am not a picky eater.   Everyone I encountered here was incredibly friendly, from our server (who seemed to possess the ability to read minds, as she asked if we wanted soy sauce after we had sat down and stared at our sushi and wasabi) to the bartender (he even entertained us with a quick magic trick). I really liked the fish, mashed potatoes, yams.. .mmmmm comfort food so good. One thing I would steer clear of is the blue oysters. Oysters in a buffet is bad news. Approach with extreme caution. I did not and my gag reflex paid for it."}
{"text":"After a long day walking the convention floor at CES, a few friends and I decided to have dinner here at The Buffet.  I've been here several times and have my favorite dishes.  This evening, I opted for Pizza, Macaroni & Cheese, Fried Chicken, Hot Link Sausage, and for dessert a Slice of Blueberry Pie.  The food is pretty good.  My favorite is the Fried Chicken and Mac n Cheese.  The Chicken has a nice, crispy & flaky skin to it with the white meat tender and juicy in the inside.  The Mac n Cheese is thick and gooey....nom nom!  Since it was dinner, they had the small bar open, so I had some Oktoberfest Beer to wash it all down....this was complimentary, bonus!  Overall, we had a good dinner with great service.  Will I return?  Sure."}
{"text":"Not worth the price .... no pastries just doughnut holes no fresh fruit just canned and pineapple not even an orange or an apple .... no coffee creamers only one line of breakfast foods then two giant gross yogurt bars like who needs two yogurt bars... no granola no oat meal. Bottomless mimosas made with malt liquor gonna give you an instant hang over.   the list goes on and on save your money folks ..."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst buffets I have ever had. Do you like the Best Western continental breakfast? Than even you will be disappointed. The food was subpar at best with rock hard biscuits, dried grainy grits, and mediocre fruit. The one star of this review would be for the Bacon; that was OK.  The bottom line is, this place makes Denny's look gourmet. Do yourself a favor and pretend this place doesn't exist. Save your money and go Anywhere else."}
{"text":"I was skeptical but now I'm a believer. I was staying here for 5 nights and really couldn't believe I didn't know about this earlier. Brunch is really a good value.   Something you don't see anymore, the chef was constantly checking to make sure the food was up to par, hot n fresh.   Pluses all you can eat crab legs are cold but you can have them warmed up. Hot REAL butter,  The Asian station had fried rice steamed veggies and vegetarian lo mein.  What'll ya have for dem eggs??? Scrambled eggs, eggs Benedict, omelette station French toast, pancakes and waffles with toppings  Grits station with lox n bagels Fresh fruit station, salads  Carving station with turkey roast beef and ham  Did I mention all you can drink juice coffee and champagne.  HICCUP AS I STUBLE UP THE ELEVATOR TO ROOM 1833 which was perfeccccct.  Hey I'm middle class and frugal. It's a good value at $25.  What did I hate or not like?? The reason I didn't know about his sooner.   Highly recommended for some of your favorite comforts from home!!!"}
{"text":"It helps to be the first one in the buffet line and grab all the food before other people mess it up. They've got a great variety; everything from Italian, mediterranean, etc. They've got chefs ready to cook you a custom pasta dish. Juan cooked me delicious salmon pasta with marinera and alfredo sauce."}
{"text":"This, so far, is the WORST buffet in Vegas. We bought lunch and used the coupon book so paid two-meals-for-one price. THANK GOD! Otherwise, I would have demanded my money back. Not only was the food not fit to eat, there wasn't enough of it...empty to close-to-empty food dishes so I'll never know if some things may have been OK. Salad bar was pathetic; no sunflower seeds; no beets; no bacon; lousy, flavorless, runny ranch. The only saving grace was the cherry Pepsi...$21 for two good sodas!"}
{"text":"Meh, the Buffet was about on par with a standard college dormitory. The service was good but the selection and taste weren't really too good. The all you can drink beer was good, but that's the only plus in an otherwise mediocre buffet."}
{"text":"Since the resort has been taken over by Westgate, experienced the remodel,  and new chef the quality had improved tremendously. We enjoy regular breakfast and dinner selections."}
{"text":"Definitely wouldn't go back and very disappointed. The price was way too much for the quality and selection. $27 buffet mid week should be epic but it was more Home Town buffet like  with half the selection. Waste of money and unless they lower the price to $15 not worth it all."}
{"text":"We've always been very happy with the food. Of course they could use a bigger variety, but the staff makes up for anything that could be lacking.  The hostess Elsa always greats us with a smile and a hug, and gives us tips on the food. Prime Rib tastes awesome when grilled"}
{"text":"We checked into Westgate and got complimentary breakfast for each day of our stay. The regular price per person for buffet breakfast is $9 which is very reasonable even if you have to pay.  The food is plenty and comes with your staple breakfast items such as scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, and potatoes. There are also pasta and spaghettis for those who gambled too hard the night before and doesn't know day from night.   The beverage bar is self served and you can choose juice, soda, or iced tea. Milk, coffee, and hot tea are served by the waiter.  There is an omelette station where you can order a freshly made omelette stuffed with cheese, mushrooms, peppers and onions, and ham. One time, there was a steak/brisket station. The brisket was very moist with a good chunk of creamy fat. The steak was a bit dry.  The breakfast is decent and the waiters/waitresses hustle and bustle constantly to get your coffee/tea refilled. Gratuity isn't included in the voucher so be sure to leave a tip!"}
{"text":"Do you have anything less than one star? I remember better food in my high school cafeteria. The prime rib was like shoe leather. The Mac n cheese was tasteless. The sirloin was inedible. Mashed potatoes cold. The only thing that I didn't leave half a plate of was the salad and most of the toppings for that were wilted. Ranch dressing covers a lot of sins. Terrible!"}
{"text":"So the Westgate has this deal where if you decline maid service, they'll give you a $10 food voucher every day. It wasn't a surprise, then, that we decided to head down to the hotel's Fresh Buffet for breakfast.  The place was pretty empty and the food offerings were almost uniformly atrocious. The scrambled eggs were dry and chalky, the sausage was tough and unyielding, the bacon was chewy, the corned beef hash was greasy, and other items were unlabeled and impossible to identify (even after eating!)  So why am I giving this buffet three stars? The made-to-order egg station. I asked for an omelette with everything in it and honestly it was astonishingly delicious. All the components went really well together and the egg was cooked perfectly (i.e. It was neither under or over done).  I don't think I'd return to try the lunch or dinner buffets but I might just go back for that egg station."}
{"text":"See update."}
{"text":"Food was good. What really made the difference was a waitress named Moui. She is the heart of this place. She served us with a smile as she bought our coffee and orange juice. As I watch her work she serve other people with many ethnic backgrounds, some young, some old. As Moui picked up the tables, she worked as fast as possible to get another group of people in, so they won't have to wait. She came back to see if we needed a anything else a few times. You could tell she loved her job, she loves people. Her customer sevice alone is a five star experience."}
{"text":"[Review is for the Brunch Buffet]  Pros:  -Great For Families -Comp'd for staying at Westgate  Cons: -No Variety -$20 is a bit steep for what's offered. -Drink Machine doesn't work properly -Sticky floors  The Brunch Buffet was bad. The food ranged from ok to bland. Sausage Links were good and the ice cream machine was lit but the Eggs Benedict weren't cooked properly and the eggs and chorizo had more egg than chorizo. The french toast was bland even with Maple Syrup and powdered sugar.  It's great that we got this for free but I would have been mad if I payed for the buffet. $20 per person is not a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Our server, Pross did a great job! People here are very friendly and helpful! Great food! I recommend their pasta!"}
{"text":"They took away the pasta station and the omelet station which were the two best parts of the buffets. Why would they do that and the price is still the same. This deserved 5 stars but not anymore and until they put it back this is not worth the price."}
{"text":"Front desk cashier was very rude, ruined my morning. The food is not cooked all the way, also buffet manager wants you to leave asap haha"}
{"text":"The only reason this place gets 5 stars, is for Reyden! He is the the best! His customer service is out of this world, never had an empty drink, dirty dishes or a frown on his face!"}
{"text":"It's ok I guess if your broke and want free beer or liquor. Kinda disappointing if your looking for a Vegas buffet experience.  Food: not very much flavor eggs were not cooked very well, the pork chops sucked and some of the food is not labeled properly . Not very much selection either but it's not terrible, Denny's and hometown buffet is better  Price: $20 for dinner and weekend lunch better price then other places beware they don't have free beer everyday drink section varies.  Ambience: quiet and not very packed servers were friendly and attentive, probably because there was no one there."}
{"text":"Horrible food, cold and tough. Very little selection, even the deserts were not edible. Stay away!"}
{"text":"Very impressed. Came here not expecting much but it was convenient since I had a room at Westgate. It was really good for the price. Not a whole lot of variety but they have all the basics. The flank steak and brisket was delicious!"}
{"text":"We got to eat the dinner buffet for free. So for a free buffet, it wasn't bad. Wine and beer is also included in the price of the buffet. It's very average with very fatty foods. It's very much like hometown buffet."}
{"text":"For your $20 do not do with it what I did and fantasize about a buffet with variety, freshness, and flavor. What I had was probably the worse buffet ever. Service was odd , seating close quarters, and the food quality lacking! All I am saying is that I would rather have chicken nuggets from McDonald's than their pseudo orange chicken which was as red as a valentine's day heart. The meat carving station was pre-loaded with dried up meat and the available bread was stale! I can honestly say that this buffet was mediocre at best and it really had little appeal to me at all. True that wine and beer are included in the price tag, but don't allow that to lure you in. I even tried to enjoy the dessert  offerings and still I failed to be pleased here. This is less than mediocre. Better to spend a little more at the Harrah's Buffet and get better quality food."}
{"text":"I have to say, I'm surprised by how much I've enjoyed eating at the Buffet at the Hilton. We had brunch there on Mother's Day and dinner there last night. The brunch was actually VERY good and the dinner was average/good, so 4 stars seems about right as an average :-)  This is not a buffet to go out of your way for. But if you're in the neighborhood (convention center, Sahara, Riviera, etc) or staying on-property, it's definitely worth checking out. Prices are more than fair. We paid $19.95 pp for dinner which included unlimited beer/wine (tips appreciated of course!). This is a great value. And the food is good - not trendy, but plenty of options to eat as healthy or badly as you desire! Nice display of grilled meats and veggies at the back. Pasta to order, etc.  Service was great at brunch and so-so at dinner. And for you sports nuts, the buffet is adjacent to the large sports book and fan cave."}
{"text":"We got the complementary breakfast for 2 with our online room reservation . Has good variety for breakfast. Everything was fresh . I liked the omelette station. They even have egg Benedict which I like."}
{"text":"@LasVegasHilton Weekend Brunch is $17.99 per person. Serving crab legs,prime rib a full breakfast and more.  They have made to order eggs, steak,bbq ribs,fried chicken, lox,bagels and cream cheese plus they have lots of donuts,rolls and pastries.  Service is good, line moves real quick so real wait plus the sportsbook is right there so you can watch the game while you wait in line.  For under $20 for a weekend brunch a pretty good deal and the food is really good so it's well worth it!!"}
{"text":"During my recent stay at Westgate (which was seriously only because we had a road trip stopover in Vegas and needed a bed, and I had points racked up from a booking website), our room included two free breakfast buffets at the \"Fresh Buffet.\" So... why not?  I look back and see reviews from colleagues that had dined here for reals during dinner time, and most are pretty sad. Yes, after going through the lavish buffets of Wicked Spoon, The M, Bachannal (the list continues), I knew this spot wouldn't be able to live up to the dream.  However, for a breakfast buffet, they did aiite.  Selection of food was pretty vast even for an early meal. You've got your standard American fare of eggs, sausages, etc. mixed in with some Latin influences, a salad bar featuring smoked salmon and fresh fruit, and even an omelette bar. We were able to find some good stuff during our first and second rounds, so you can still get an enjoyable meal for cheap.  Our server Keith was great too. He kept refilling our orange juice, coffee, and water all the way, and was very generous with making sure we were well taken care of. Thanks man! You really made the experience for us.  If you are staying here and got the complimentary breakfast buffet, there's no reason not to use it. Go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Stayed at the resort for 4 days and the buffet came with the room package. I would not pay the full price which cost $17 for breakfast and $19 for lunch. The food was generally not appealing. It is perfectly fine to eat here if you are heading to the convention in the morning. The cook to order egg station (breakfast) and pasta station (lunch) are very good and the cooks are nice. The pastry at the coffee shop at the resort looked way better than the pastry at the buffet. I did not even try the pastry because they looked so sad. The corn bread was yummy. The servers on the left side of the room are all nice and cheerful, but the ones on the right side of the room can be ignorant.   Overall, it served me well for my work day breakfast and lunch but I would go to the more famous Vegas buffets for pleasure."}
{"text":"The Brunch was amazing! They had French toast, pancakes, sausage, bacon, eggs, potatoes, carnita chillaquiles, drinks, and much more! The menu outside the buffet entrance makes it seem as if there is not much but it's way more than enough. Awesome choice!"}
{"text":"The place has complimentary beer and wine (the choices are limited but what can you expect for the price). There is cold peel and eat shrimp, turkey, roast beef, ribs, lamb, along with plenty of side dishes. The quality is not the best but not he worst either. The salad bar is just above nonexistent. If you are lying low between high priced dinners and happen to be near by, 'why not'?"}
{"text":"We ate here Saturday morning with zero expectations and boy did it deliver. It was the Champagne Brunch, $19.99/pp, includes unlimited champagne and the best of both worlds--breakfast and lunch.    The prime rib was amazing as was the omlette bar. They had tons of variety to choose from including snow crab legs. You can get very creative with all their offerings...something for everyone.   Definitely did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Pretty bad. A notch below hometown buffet, and you get to spend $25.i had the Mongolian beef,pizza,lasagna and prime rib. Only the prime rib was acceptable.  Go somewhere else"}
{"text":"I came here because locals get a great discount for the buffet. Too bad you get what you pay for.   @ Raw Oysters - Not fresh. They salted it to try to hide the unfreshness. My stomach got a really uneasy feeling the next morning. Since I was the only one in my group to get the oysters, I suspect this was the item that got me sick.This is what really brought them down to 1 stars.   @ Prime Rib - The staple meat at all buffets. 2 of the 3 was really dry and almost burnt to a crisp. 1 of the 3 was at least red, but still wasn't very good. It just lacked flavor and the goodness of a prime rib.  @ Lamb chop - Why can't I get my meat more rare? This was just cooked perfectly for the temperature, but I want my meat bleeding in a puddle of blood when I eat it!  @ NY Steak - Cooked a notch above medium rare, was actually not too bad. Much better than the 1st or 2nd prime rib and lamb chop.  @ Shrimp Cocktail - Flavorless shrimp. Yum Yum. *rolls eyes*  @ Mussels - This was drenched in sauce, thats why it tasted okay. I guess you're eating the sauce here, and not the mussels.   @ Salmon - This wasn't that bad. It was cooked just right and the fish still retained the natural flavors before it was seasoned to death.   @ Orange Pork - If you're not Chinese or you lost your Chinese card you will enjoy this dish.  @ Pork Dumpling - No flavor at all. At least it was warm.   @ Mash Potatoes - Was this really mash potatoes? Needed to seasoned more and actually mashed. Its mashed potatoes, not chunked potatoes.   @ Pasta - This is  made to order. The chef will make it to you're liking. Pasta was acceptable, but just don't expect anything exciting with it.  I don't know why they give you a big plate of pasta, enough for 2 people.  @ Apple Pie - Tastes just like a regular apple pie. Nothing too exciting about it. It just a mediocre item.   @ Bananna Cream Pie - Same as the apple pie. Nothing to really write home about.  @ Brownie - Just decent. Not bad or good. If enjoy brownies, you'll get your fill.  @ Cheesecake - Best item in the entire buffet. If you come here, you absolutely must get it. Now, its not to the same caliber as Cheesecake Factory, but since everything tasted so mediocre, this will taste exceptional!  Our waitress was very friendly. She was really attentive with clearing our plates in a timely fashion and bringing us our drinks. Nothing more you can ask for a buffet.  Breakfast is $5 for locals $14 non-locals. Lunch is $6 for locals and $15 non-locals. Dinner is $8 for locals and $20 non-locals. Sunday Brunch is $12 for locals and $19 for non-locals. You just need to sign up for the Players Club (free) to get these prices. You also get a nifty keychain with an LED light that doubles as a bottle opener. You can buy up to 3 non-locals buffet, if you have a group that want a cheap buffet. This is applicable on Sundays, Monday, and Wednesday.  This buffet is really small compared to the bigger buffets at the strip casinos. Food is pretty bad, but I've tasted much worse. Unless you get the locals prices, move along. Be sure to skip the raw oysters! Spend a little more at the other buffets and enjoy your meal (and not get sick)."}
{"text":"The reviews on here are crazy! People complaining about the cost - hello, it's Vegas. Ours rang up as $12 each, but We got ours for free with our reservations at the Westgate. We have stayed in 5 star all inclusives that didn't have this good of a buffet. Huge variety, tasted fresh. We were stuffed!  Enjoyed it very much.  There are people at Starbucks paying $10 for mini oatmeal and a coffee - that's a waste of money."}
{"text":"Wasn't worth the 25 dollar price tag, food was dry , tasteless, salty, over all I was not happy with quality at all.  I wouldn't recommended it at all. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"The made to order was good but for the price.. Even with a discount... Poor quality of food. Fatty ham, overcooked, crab legs were not fresh, sushi fell apart in clumps in my hand...couldn't eat it. Found solace in a slice of wheat toast and hummus."}
{"text":"I only come here on Sundays for brunch and really like it.  As a local, I pay $15 and the buffet has crab legs -- a real bargain for a crab-lover like me.  The pork ribs were terrific but the beef ribs were inedible.  The rest seemed average and I'll keep comin' if the price is right.  :-)"}
{"text":"This is about as good of a buffet as you're going to get for under $20.  Jeez, I felt like such a cheapo typing that.   Oh well.    So, let's start off with the bad.  It's not right on the newer part of the strip, it's more old strip down by the Riv, but whatever.  That's not such a big deal.  The other part that I didn't care for was that the crab legs were icky.  They were not meaty, they were sickly looking, and I had to put them down after my first couple attempts because I didn't enjoy the texture.  So on to the good.  The rest of the food was great quality and sooo yummy.  Gotta love having bacon strips, and good quality ones, on the buffet at all times.  Service was great, dessert table was full and yummy looking (I passed so I could eat more bacon...I'll admit it!).  Everything was truly a hit, and I was really happy we stopped by here.  Lastly, I must apologize for not giving more specifics on the food.  It's Vegas...I'm sure you can imagine the fog that encased my head!"}
{"text":"One of the cheaper ones for buffet brunch. $21 not including bottomless mimosas. That's an extra $5. So for $26 bottomless mimosa all-you-can-eat establishment, it's steal. The drawback? Pretty limited on food items. Basic American breakfast buffet with some Mexican flair thrown into the mix. Dessert bar didn't have as many options either. Build your own sundae and a handful of cakes and pie slices. Nothing fancy but again you're not paying the extravagant prices either. I felt that it was worth the money."}
{"text":"Brunch time at the Fresh buffet inside the Westgate casino. Not as packed as I thought it would be, once I paid  I realized that at $18.00 per person for brunch, it can be pricey if  you take your family.   Once we went in to get seated, we were able to see what the restaurant looked like. First impressions of the place were of a clean, and organized buffet.   We were seated quickly, our drinks were ordered and we were off to grab food! I'm the kind of person who grabs the plate, and walks around looking at the variety of food that is available, and if it looks appetizing.  The food looked really Good! The presentation of the food was really good and it made it looked even more appetizing. We grabbed our food sat down and started enjoying the food. The quality was good as you should expect for the price. Guys, I gotta tell you...the beef brisket was so delicious! It was tender, it was tasty, and it was so soft it would fall apart when you pulled it apart with your fork!   Overall the experience was good. The only negative was that there wasn't a bigger selection for the price, but the quality of the food made up for it.   I would give this place a 3.8 score."}
{"text":"I read the reviews first and was unsure of the food so when we walked up they offered to let us look around before we paid and we did as so the options weren't too many but also offered to make anything you wanted with they have which I thought was awesome 25$ and they had prime rib salmon turkey shrimp not bad and everything tasted great!"}
{"text":"A decent buffet, not terrible but not 5 star. They have a special right now. If you use comps Sunday to Thursday, the buffet is anywhere from $4-7 depending on which meal. Service is decent."}
{"text":"As hotel buffets go, this one is plenty good. For the money ($12.95, when I went), it's extremely good food. I particularly enjoyed the bacon and the french toast.   There's a fairly good selection of fruit.  There was moldy swiss cheese, about which I advised our waiter. He seemed genuinely surprised and concerned so I wouldn't concern myself too much with their food prep habits.  The grits were less than pleasing, but that's to be expected as I'm from the south and this place isn't in it..."}
{"text":"Blaah. Ate here in a party of five because we were staying at the hotel and it was convenient.   By Las Vegas standards, $22 for a buffet is not expensive but by my standards I do expect some good food at that price.  The LVH Buffet failed to deliver. Basically, nothing was terrible but nothing was like \"Wow, I gotta get me some more of that!\"  Everyone else in my party felt the same.  I had the salmon (dry and tough), chicken Marsala (flavorless).  The turkey was ok, as was the beef and the sausage.  I could find no fault with the shrimp cocktail.  The salad bar was uninspiring and blah - at least have some pepperoni.   There was unlimited beer and wine -- cheap beer (Hamms) and wine.  Good to get drunk on but alas I had to drive to the airport later that evening, otherwise I would have  tried to drink my money's worth. The best part of the meal was the soft-serve chocolate ice cream. We went on a Sunday night and some of the things mentioned in other reviews were not there, namely Mexican food and sushi.  I like both.  My dining experience definitely suffered in their absence. Service was good. In the end I regretted being lazy and settling for the convenience of this buffet.  I would have rather have put the $120 I spent towards a better quality buffet at another hotel or gone to a restaurant off the strip and had a cheaper and better meal."}
{"text":"Now that I have tried other buffets for comparison I am downgrading the Hilton buffet.  There, take that mediocre buffet!  Ha!"}
{"text":"Not sure why it's rated so low, sure it's not the most fancy buffet in the city but for the price it's pretty good stuff. I might not recommend going out of your way for it but if you're staying at the Westgate and you don't feel like leaving it's a perfectly fine option. No regrets!"}
{"text":"Having low expectations about this place, it actually allowed this place to exceed expectations.  Staying at LVH, we got complementary coupons to try the buffet.  Knowing we were going to pay for a big dinner, we wanted to grab a small snack beforehand.  Sure, a buffet isn't quite a snack, but I wasn't expecting to eat much, and since it was complementary, the whole \"eating what I paid for\" concept that usually happens at most buffets didn't apply here.  But the food was actually quite tasty.  They're currently having their FESTIVAL ITALIANO.  I tried a few items.  A couple of their pasta dishes, some meat from their freshly sliced section.  They even have a made to order pasta station if you want to be so bold as to create your own pasta dish.  I was a little bummed we couldn't have any of the complementary beer and wine.  Apparently that is only for the weekends.  Overall, a pretty decent buffet if you're staying at the LVH."}
{"text":"I'm keeping this short, it was bad enough we wasted an hour in some in there. The place was nice and all, but there wasn't a lot to choose from. A lot was cold already.. Towards the end after we ate most of our meal, we went to go get desert and thats when my husband noticed gnats and mosquitoes. We were instantly turned off and left. Later that night my husband ended up barfing up his whole dinner. Needless to say, we will never come back. And advise strongly against anyone else coming."}
{"text":"The waiting line is way too long. We arrived at 9:00, and we could not make it to the restaurant before 10am. You do the math."}
{"text":"Half the price of most Vegas buffets and half as good. For example, at most Vegas buffets you might see a cheese selection, Guyere, Brie, sharp cheddar. At Westgate you get the Colby jack cheese cubes you can get at Sam's Club or any grocery. Asian, Mexican? Yes...save your money and head to Golden Coral. My night was special however as the girls of roller derby were in town, mixed amongst the power eaters and families. The staff was very pleasant and the brisket was good."}
{"text":"Seriously by far the worst thing ever. They had the smallest selection in food for the price they charge. I came here dude to convenience, big mistake. And the small selection they did have the food was horrible. No taste what so ever. I'm not a picky person but this place deserves an negative star. So bad !"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here the last time we stayed at the LVH a month or two ago, and to be honest, I wasn't sober enough to write a review of it after that.  So, this time, we hit the Champagne Brunch, and after exercising remarkable restraint by not downing 37 Mimosas, I am able to give this place a whopping two stars.    Hits: The omelet bar.  But to be fair, every buffet has an omelet bar and omelets aren't rocket science.  Misses: Every other single item on the menu.  From the tough-as-leather steak-looking substance to the just plain awful supposedly Chinese food that can best be described as \"orange-colored-soggy-chicken-mcnugget-looking-thing,\" there wasn't a single item on that menu that would make me want it again in the future.  Also annoying is the fact that you have to go get your own Mimosas from the champagne bar when every other place brings them to you.  Plus, the guy manning it was on his cell phone every time I went up there.  I had the impression I was seriously cutting into his Facebooking time when I asked him to make me another one, which isn't how you want to feel as a customer who dumped money to eat there.  Next, some of the food wasn't labeled, leaving me to wonder what it was.  Guess that's just part of the whole Vegas \"gambling\" experience.  Pass.    There are much, much better buffets out there.  I think the GN's is the same price, and is a hell of a lot better.  And even the Station Casinos like Sam's Town have way better for a lot less.    Now I'm trying to remember why I gave this two stars instead of one."}
{"text":"A winos paradise. Unlimited wines in three varieties? Chablis, blush or burgundy? Unlimited beer? A pasta station with a dude who made me Camarones a la diabla?  A salad bar with fresh homemade salads and everything a pescaterian like myself could desire! The weakest spot is the desserts, the froyo is sub par and the pastries are dry but your so full from everything else who cares. If your on the north end of the strip looking for one of the few unlimited alcohol buffets look no further!"}
{"text":"Decent buffet but most of the items tasted as just okay, nothing stood out in my opinion. The price is high for a off the strip hotel casino.  At the time to valet it was $40 to leave your car and $30 to self park, not sure if this is normal or since it is located near the convention center they make money off the people looking for parking, could also be that there is a Monorail stop here.  Friends were staying here and we needed to have brunch and pick them up, we got the parking validated but I think because our friends stood there, a security guard mentioned to play in order to get it waived but if you are not gambling then what."}
{"text":"Had the Champagne Brunch.  The service was phenomenal, uneaten plates were always gone by the time I sat down from another trip; my drinks were always refilled promptly.  The food, on the other hand, was lacking.  Most of the items were completely over cooked and dried out.  When fresh, however, the food can be quite good.  I particularly enjoyed the sirloin strips.  But this buffet needs to dial down on the heat lamps because by my second trip, the same batch of food instantly overcooked/dried out.  I also made myself a custom ice cream cake out of a base of lemon cake, soft serve ice cream on top, garnished by some M&Ms.  It was quite good.  I know, I know, I try."}
{"text":"My friend had some comp coupons for the buffet, so we went at breakfast time one day. It had your typical buffet fare (a little of everything) and was rather greasy and salty. The waitresses are ancient...as my friend put it, \"I think they dug her up to cover a shift for someone!\" Most buffet-goers were HUGE and had two or three plates piled up in their pudgy arms. (This is a BUFFET folks, they're not running out of food anytime soon! I don't think even the recession can hit this place) I would go here again if I had a comp coupon, but otherwise I'd skip it."}
{"text":"I feel bad for giving just 1 star but for the price, this place should've had more of a variety. I went for lunch and I sadly have to say, the best thing I ate was the Mac and Cheese. There was an extremely small selection to choose from and I honestly didn't want to eat anything :/ I felt bad because I went with my family and for the price, I tried to eat as much as possible. I would prefer going to hometown buffet (do they still exists?!) because from my memory, they have wayyy more of a variety. Nothing special about this place, I say, spend your $ at a better buffet."}
{"text":"This is a decent buffet at a good buffet's prices, but selection is fairly moderate here. For breakfast, the usual hot trays laden with rolled blinis and pancakes and muffins and plenty of meats, etc. etc. are all here. It all seemed pretty rotated and fresh, so no problems there. Nothing really stands out except selection is a bit light. The line was also smaller than at some I've been to, but there is really nothing special at all about this buffet compared to other places. If you were in the mood for a buffet and close at hand, this would be fine, but nothing to go out of your way for. This is another, like all buffets in Vegas, that you will be most likely to stand in line to wait for...debatably worth it..."}
{"text":"the reason you come to vegas...the buffets! sadly, i was hungover, so i wasn't feeling 100%, but i know what good food taste like, nonetheless. we looked up the best buffets in vegas and the buffet at the hilton was among the top 3 in all the reviews we checked. the sushi bar is the best and probably the main reason to come back. the sliders were super tasty, as was the pizza and other seafood. the dessert options are definitely the cherry on top. we'd come back for sure."}
{"text":"Much like the rest of the LVH, the Buffet is sliding downhill.  What used to be a surprisingly good value is now not much better than a well-run Golden Corral.  Spend the 50% extra and go to the Carnival Buffet at the Rio for better food quality and a better selection."}
{"text":"This was awful and I was drunk, which is really saying something. Only half the stuff was labeled. The fried chicken needed to be dipped in water to make it edible. Desserts were terrible too. Stay away, spend your $24 elsewhere."}
{"text":"Very friendly service... Loved the all you can drink champagne ... Good variety in food... Omelette bar pretty good and friendly kKlm"}
{"text":"Eek! Methinks not was exactly what I was thinking when walking around the buffet area. My boyfriend has been staying at the Las Vegas Hotel for our budget trips and the casino gave us two complimentary buffet passes for dinner. They were FREE buffet passes, but I am still giving it one star. The regular price for dinner was around $21.00 per person and that is definitely NOT worth the price for this buffet.  Food:  Orange Chicken: Their orange chicken is pretty much microwaved chicken nuggets with an orange syrup sauce. If I had the palette of a three year old, I would have maybe enjoyed this. Chow Mein: It was a joke. There was chow mein all over the floor and counter.  Carne Asada Meat: Dry and no flavor. Steamed Dumplings: This is probably the one thing that I could eat at the buffet that had a decent flavor and texture. I think I ate 6 dumplings. Fried Chicken: The batter was overly crispy and the chicken meat was super dry. I couldn't finish it.  Pasta: There is a pasta bar that reuses the cocktail shrimp. There was nothing that special about it. Ice Cream: The ice cream is a soft serve vanilla or chocolate which wasn't that special. It pretty much melts straight up when it lands in your ice cream bowl.   Service: The ladies here were nice but they also seemed to have the same sentiments that I did in wanting to be at the buffet.   And to top it all off? I got a nice old stomach ache when I left the buffet and chowed down on some pepto bismol pills to help my stomach process all of the crappy food that I just ate.   Bottom line: I went here for free but I probably wouldn't come back if you paid me. There is a McDonalds down the street, I'd rather dine there and get my $2.22 Big Mac."}
{"text":"$21 for each person.  Moderate size. The Beef Brisket is the Truth.  So much flavor with a lot of smokey flavor, and the fat melts in your mouth. It's worth your money for a buffet in vegas."}
{"text":"Didn't like this place.  Didn't think it was fresh either.  Feeding trough of a place and overpriced.  Wished they had an a la carte menu, which they didn't.  The only good thing I had was a cinammon donut.  Skip this place."}
{"text":"Decent and well prepared. If you at a convention at the LV convention center ,take a short walk and enjoy."}
{"text":"WORST VEGAS BUFFET EVER!!!  My fiancé and I only came here because we had a free buffet voucher. If this weren't a free meal we would have never come here since the reviews weren't exactly stellar.  The only good thing about this buffet is that we had a nice waitress. She really paid attention to our drink refills and minded our plates.   Everything else was just horrible... The food was just bland.   -The pizza made me wish I was eating little caesars instead.  -Tortillas just stuck on to each other... I had to pry them apart after grabbing more than I actually needed.  -There wasn't much of a selection. -The \"asian' section consisted of the most unnaturally orange \"orange chicken\"    sigh...  -The soft serve ice cream was just like flavored and churned water. It was gross.  -The pumpkin pie was the worst I have EVER had. I'd rather pick some up from the grocery bakery. It's just like previous reviewers had said... The sweets tastes like its make for diabetics.  -The soft serve ice cream area had a container full of gummy bears... my fiancé ate one and said that it was as hard as a rock. - I have no idea how long those gummies have been sitting there.  - The soft serve ice cream bar had sprinkles in a vase with a cork in it... ONLY FOR DECORATION!!! Who does that?!  -I also saw a piece of apple pie with a HAIR IN IT!!!   Oh wait... I did take something good from this buffet... I stuffed my purse with a few cereal boxes left over from breakfast time. They couldn't mess cereal up.   Next time... We're going to actually pay for a visit to the buffet at the M instead."}
{"text":"Can we say nasty?!?!?  Good thing I didn't have to pay for it. Would def not come back even if it comes with free and free beer"}
{"text":"I wish I could confidently support this place but the majority of the food was either dry, cold and lacked flavor.  The tables around us were left dirty, wrappers and paper napkins left on the floor.  I saw the A rated signs they received and I am perplexed at how and who they had visit this buffet.  Don't waste your money.  Run away if someone tells you to eat here."}
{"text":"Went there with a group of 7 for champagne brunch on a Saturday.  The seated all of us at a table made for 6 in front of the place that had a couple of metal signs right next to us.  Every time half of us got up to eat we had to go around them.  The hostess also embarressed one of the ladies in our group.  She said \"Champagne comes with the buffet but not for you since you are expecting\" and she is not pregnant.  That comment ruined her meal, her day and the rest of her trip.  Not to mention that we had to hear about it for the rest of the trip.  The food wasn't too bad except for the crab legs.  I am not sure if they were old or just not prepared correctly but the meat was sticking to the inside of the shells so it was almost impossible to eat.  I have been to Las Vegas multiple times and with all of the dining options for $25 I would skip this place next time."}
{"text":"My conclusion of this buffet is that it's specially catered to old folks who can't have salt or sugar in their diets. We would have never came if it weren't for the $50 gift card we got. I guess this place is going down soon that it's trying to save cost to prolong its lifespan.   Basically everything is tasteless. Nothing taste like what they look like. Chicken doesn't taste like chicken, corn doesn't taste like corn. I really don't know how they do it, it is amazing of how robbed of taste everything is. I had 3 oysters, 2 were tasteless, 1 was bitter. I was afraid to try anything else in the seafood bar after that. Either everything is frozen for a year or they have boiled the shit out of everything before serving. The raw oyster deal I really have no idea how that could be. The orange chicken was very obvious it was frozen chicken nuggets + sauce. I can't remember what else I had was bad... I don't even want to try to remember.   If you are on a salt free or sugar free diet, do stop at this buffet."}
