{"text":"location closed :(  Best new kept secret in Mississauga! You have probably driven right past this place an might not have even noticed.   Quality of food is always fresh, consistent and on par with the other location. Staff are wonderful and the dining area is modern and clean.  Can't go wrong with any of the food items as all are made fresh !   Recently had the bone broth , very delicate and just wonderful."}
{"text":"Lovely place, genuinely friendly wait staff. I didn't catch her name but the waitress was politely attentive. We came at noon which is when their start time is on Saturdays but were told to come back in half an hour by the waitress as the chef hadn't arrived. Slight inconvenience but hopefully it isn't a regular occurrence. Beautiful seating, simple menu. They offer haddock, cod and halibut. Usually halibut at $14.99 with fish and chips would mean I get two pieces or 1.5 but they just gave one. Still, it was a lovely meal (I wouldn't have had enough room for two anyways)."}
{"text":"My husband and I both ordered Halibut and fries for takeout from English Bay Fish & Chips today. Considering how hungry we were at the time, it was a pleasant surprise that our order was only going to take a few minutes to ready. Upon arriving at home, and looking at the food though, we realized that in order to speed up the food preparation time, both fish and fries had been REFRIED to save on time and waste! It's difficult to say how long the fish had been sitting out, but all you could taste was the oily, thick batter and flavourless halibut when eating. Suffice to say, neither of us finished or enjoyed our meal, nor will we be going back.  This was probably the worst halibut and chips we have ever had. Note to the owner, if you're not prepared to serve fresh fish and chips to your customers, don't bother running a restaurant."}
{"text":"Ordered take out from here for the first time today.  The fish was super greasy and the batter was mushy inside.  The fries were soggy too. Service was quick; only took 10 min.  Don't think i'll order from here again though."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The fish was delicious as were the incredible fries! I loved every bite of it! Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Best battered fish I've ever had. Had mine with the sweet potato fries and the Cajun dipping sauce. Waitress was very nice and attentive as well. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My mother and I were frequents at the English Bay in Oakville every Tuesday evening. When they opened up this location we were a little hesitant and didn't want to take a risk of trying them because if you're like us, you'll fall in love with something somewhere, take the chance of trying it at another location or somewhere else and it ruins that item for you, whatever it may be. We took the chance and it was literally AMAZING! It was exactly like the location in Oakville and you get to seat yourself (booth in the back is always ours). The food is made fresh and served super quick. They have a huge variety of menu items but it isn't too much to choose from. There tea selection is exceptional and service is amazing. Desserts are great too! It's exactly like the Oakville location just a different set up inside. 5/5 for both!! Keep it up."}
{"text":"Phenomenal!!! Best fish and chips I have ever had. I lived in the UK for several months so I know good fish and chips. The ones at English Bay Fish & Chips are one of the best. For those who do take out (which is what I did) just open the lid of the meal box while you drive home. When you get home it'll still be crispy and warm enough."}
{"text":"Great fish and chips. Never eaten in but the take out service is great. Portions are huge and the prices are very reasonable. Fish is always top quality. For fussy eaters they have really good chicken strips. A reliable Oakville source of a British staple !!"}
{"text":"This is the REAL heir apparent to the dearly-departed Macy's.  I'd known about English Bay in Oakville for a while, but never had a chance to visit until last night. Turns out that several months of going to the same place every Friday (Swiss Chalet) will eventually make you get tired of it and seek more fertile ground.  This place is better in nearly every way than Macy's, which is no mean feat considering the latter was my most-praised fish and chip joint of all time. The prices are cheaper than Macy's ($12 for cod? $15 for halibut? Sold!). The sides taste just as good. The desserts are more varied (everything from ice cream cake to rice pudding). The taste is out of this world. They've even hired some of the former Macy's waitresses!  It's like they picked the best parts of Macy's and have co-opted it for their own use, which I am not complaining about by any means. It cost just under $20 for a cod combo with two sides (fries and coleslaw - they let you do a \"half-and-half\" side order for $1.25 extra) and a butterscotch sundae.  No lie, this is my new favorite fish-and-chip restaurant in the GTA. The experience is stellar across the board, with the exception of it being slightly humid when we visited. The decor may have been ripped from the 80s, but don't let that fool you - this is as good, if not better than, any other fish-and-chip joint in the city.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Every meal I have had from this restaurant is delicious. The halibut and fries and phenomenal. It is always fresh to order. The fish has the right amount of crispy bite and the fries are never soggy. As with all fish and chips, it is best when eaten at the actual restaurant to maintain it's crisp texture and warm temperature. The staff are always friendly. Definitely a gem!"}
{"text":"The servers are genuine, the place is very clean, and the fish and chips are the fish and chips of my british great grandmother.  The food is fresh, hot, and not at all processed. You can eat in or take out.  We've been twice in 2 weeks and look forward to many more visits. Fish Friday's are back!"}
{"text":"Quaint fish and chip place in the Maple Grove plaza.  You walk in a and a sign says to seat yourself.  We ordered cod and chips and the fish cakes.  Service is friendly.  The fish and chips were good.  Fish cakes were okay although menu indicates it's salmon and white fish in the cakes and I couldn't find any evidence of salmon in them.  That was the only  disappoint in an otherwise crispy fish cake.  They have a nice selection of desserts and next time I will save room to try them, especially the home made lemon ice cream pie!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place on a whim and were pleasantly surprised.  We decided on the halibut and haddock, onion rings and calamari.  The halibut was moist and fried dry the way I like it.  The haddock portion was generous and the batter was crisp and nicely seasoned. Chips were just ok cut thinner than usual chippies.  Onion rings were excellent although a tad greasy.  The calamari portion was small but delicious with a herb seasoning."}
{"text":"After reading the owner replied , I will give it another try , meanwhile I m leaving a five star , because I do appreciate the fact that the owner mark take the time to explain to us on why can the food be not so good , I m a big halibut and chips fan what can I say see you soon"}
{"text":"Located in the same plaza off Dundas with French Corner bakery. Note that Google Maps/Waze take you near here (as of Sep 2016), but not exactly... try putting French Corner in your GPS instead.  The seating for this is fancier than any other fish & chips restaurant I've been to, with waitresses formally dressed and providing good service.  I ordered the halibut & chips and my husband ordered the haddock & chips. The halibut was cooked perfectly - nice crispy exterior from the batter. The fries and tartar sauce were good but nothing special."}
{"text":"Finally tried English bay !  I have to say,  I really enjoyed my fish , its nice to see a place get it right !  The fish was perfect , nice bite and crisp to it ,yet it's was juicy inside !!  Tasted fresh and I really enjoyed it !  Place is nice and clean and it seems they take pride in there food which I respect most ! If your in the area give them a try .  I definitely will be back and so will my friends !"}
{"text":"Our regular fish-and-chips place close to work. We've sampled all the fish-and-chips places within a stone's throw of Winston Churchill and Lakeshore, and this one is definitely the best. Mmmm mmm good."}
{"text":"This place is amazing ! We went there at 5.30 PM on Saturday night in March and the waiter, Kim, was enthusiastic and helpful. Marc who seems to be the owner always smiles. We had the cod and the haddock and they were great ! The fish was fresh and it was not dry at all which is hard to find in other places (even downtown Toronto). I don't give it a full 5 stars as I have been only once but I will sure update my review once I have been there again ! The place is family friendly but also serves alcohol - which is a plus."}
{"text":"As the only real restaurant in walking distance of my office - Tim Hortons in no way counts - by default, I'm likely to take a liking to the place. The fact that they serve awesome fish and chips just serves to seal the deal.  I've only ever had takeout from here, so I can't comment on the in-restaurant service nor too much on the decor in the dining area. I can tell you they've gone with a nautical theme - as one would expect - without going tacky. I can also tell you that a takeout order has never taken more than about 20 minutes from phoning in the order to being ready for pickup, usually hovering closer to 15 minutes. Not bad at all.  In terms of quality of food, it's very good. Always delicious, really nice fries - crispy and slightly seasoned - and everything's always fresh. You also get a good deal for your money - my usual order is one piece of battered haddock, half fries and half salad. The salad is what you'd expect for a side salad most places, the fries a normal side of fries, and a huge piece of fish with just enough batter. At $12, it's certainly not as cheap as the burger joints that comprise most of our lunches out, but it definitely tastes a lot better.  Service, both in restaurant and over the phone, has always been courteous and fast. They're not banging rocks together here - they know how to run a restaurant.  I can't imagine what going out for lunch would be like around here if these guys weren't around."}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday. Halibut, haddock and chips were great! We'll come back again as regulars."}
{"text":"Service was terrible, the waitress was slow and forgetful. The place was busy and appeared to be under staffed. The food was OK but nothing to get excited about. I used to love the other location on Dundas in Mississauga, so I tried this one and was very disappointed. I likely won't ever come back. Two strikes - bad service and mediocre food. I'm not going to give them a chance to strike out.   The other location had really great wait staff and the food was always fabulous - even the to go food.   This location needs to step it up or they are going to be in trouble - in spite of the good location."}
