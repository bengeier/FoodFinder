{"text":"Very dissapointed. Everything that was fried...needed to be re-fried. Fries were raw and soggy, hushpuppies were mushy inside. My scallops were lukewarm. Overpriced and about the worst seafood of my life."}
{"text":"My wife and I took our grand-daughter to dinner at the Lobster Pot.  It recently opened up in Willoughby Hills near the intersection of SR 91 and art 6 (Chardon Rd.). My wife and I were curious if this was anyway a remake of the the original Lobster Pot in South Euclid that we frequented years ago.  They used to have a phenomenall Lobster Bisque and Lobster dinners, and it is. We made reservations  and got there early.  We selected a table near the fish tank, which may have been a mistake because we were right in front of the kitchen and there was a lot of noise emanating from it, not the quietest dinner we had. My grand daughter selected a bowl of of lobster bisque and an appetizer of crab cakes. The bisque was ok, but did not contain a lot of lobster.  The crab cakes contained a lot of filling, and minimal crab lumps, mostly shredded crab.  It was ok, but not memorable. It is hard to find good crab cakes in Northeast Ohio. My wife had the lobster Newburgh, which we asked to split, but the waitress suggested that it would not be enough to split.  After hearing that, my wife and I decided to order our own dinners. She took home over half of her dinner.  The dish was prepared very well and there was a lot of lobster in the dish, it was just too much her, so w could have split the dinner as we are not big eaters.  I ordered the fish and chips, which comprised of a huge filet of halibut served over a huge helping of French fries and a side of very tasty coleslaw.  I took home half of the fish and I was stuffed.  I was kind of disappointed in the halibut, it was ok, but not spectacular. The waitress was very prompt with service and checked back frequently to see if everything was to our satisfaction, which is a good sign of a top notch restaurant. I will definitely go back there and try different dishes.  The 3 stars I rated them as, was basically for the nondescript crab cakes, the lobster bisque, and the so - so  halibut fish and chips.   This restaurant has undergone several changes since the last time we were there.  It is a very warm and comforting atmosphere, just don't sit near the kitchen if you want a quiet dinner.   I am looking forward to going back there soon.   Refer to the pictures of our dishes."}
{"text":"We've been twice during the \"soft opening\" and have mixed reviews. I ordered Ceviche and was told the Ceviche maker had the day off.  I ordered the New England Fried Whole Belly Clams and they came out pretty crispy. Those of us old enough to remember Ho-Jo's fried clams will be disappointed in both the portion size and consistency.  The clams were so well done that most of the flavor was gone.  The Oyster Po-Boy was served on a 6\" baguette cut in half instead of a hoagie bun.  The oyster layer was carefully organized so as to be only one oyster thick and the slaw layer was over-dressed making for a pretty sloppy sandwich, nothing like the po-boys you see from New Orleans.  The Lobster Roll comes on two split-top hot dog buns, but only enough lobster for one bun. At $19 it is a couple bucks more than the huge rolls in New England for $17.  The lobster bisque is to die for but served in a large flat-ish bowl.  This allows the bisque to cool too rapidly.   As I see it, portion control is the biggest problem.  The fried clams need to be cooked at a lower temp so as not to dry them out."}
{"text":"FINALLY a superb seafood restaurant in Western Lake County! Freshest seafood uniquely and deliciously prepared. Comfortable and friendly atmosphere. And, if you're lucky, you will get the amazing Shauntay as your server. A definite must. Let's support this local business."}
{"text":"Just visited for the first time last night my husband and I went there to celebrate our Anniversary. Let me just say the food was delicious I had the scallops with lemon risotto (a little too oily, I would say less oil and more lemon on the risotto) but still pretty tasty and my husband had the lobster newburgh both were amazing. We also had the seared ahi tuna for our appetizer which was also very good. Highly recommend the chocolate mousse cake it was to die for. That being said the service was a little lacking.       When we first arrived the waitress congratulated us on our anniversary then proceeded to ask us what were having to drink which we both ordered water to start and she said \"would you like a bottle of wine?\" and both of us hadn't even looked at the wine list yet and we weren't sure if we were going to drink because we planned on going out after dinner. Well when we said no to the wine she made a groan noise like she was pouting and we both found that to be quite rude. She started to walk away and my husband said we would like to order an appetizer so we put that in but it was like because we didn't order wine she seemed put out so it was several minutes before she brought out our waters. She never told us the specials either but she did tell the table next to us. When we finally ordered our food we then decided on 2 glasses of the house wine. Our food came out very quickly which was very good but the entire time we were their the waitress was very slow on refilling our water. She asked if we wanted more wine we said no I still felt that rudeness that she was pressuring us to order all this wine. I don't like the fact that a waitress would give you bad service because you did not order wine with your dinner it should be the customer's choice because not everyone drinks and honestly it just irked me the entire time. One thing I do have to say is the manager was very nice she came over and actually got my husband more sauce for his lobster newburgh which was awesome. Also the other thing is that a lot of restaurants even the fanciest ones tend to give you a free dessert when your celebrating something but this place does not. I mean maybe it is because it is still fairly new they have not ironed out all the bugs yet. I would go there again I just hope next time the wait staff will not feel the need to be so pushy on pressuring you to drink. At least the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"We took our 8 and 10 year old here for a special NYE dinner. Our kids are pretty well behaved when they are in any restaurant so that being said, if your kids are not, don't bring them here. We were greeted with smiles and the kids were offered a toy from the treasure chest to occupy their time. They did not have a kids menu so do not mistake this place as a restaurant geared towards children. But once your kids are old enough to behave themselves and enjoy seafood it is hands down the best place for seafood on the East Side!  Food was excellent. Service was excellent. Drinks were excellent. We will Be back!"}
{"text":"Underwhelming.  The restaurant is really beautiful when you walk in. Great nautical theming throughout.  We had kids with us and they were able to go to the treasure chest and pick out a toy.  It's a really great touch and shows that someone in this place really does care... unfortunately, it did not show in the food. Most of our food was lukewarm at best and presentation was really dreadful except for the lobster roll, which was nicely plated. Side of potatoes: 3 potatoes rolling around on a plate, side of \"risotto\": glopped on the plate, drawn butter for lobster tail served in a condiment cup, and bouillabaisse was half spilled on the way to the table so it was smeared all over the rim of the bowl. The prices seemed to fit the beautiful ambiance but the quality of the meal missed the mark."}
{"text":"Simply one word can say it all amazing!  Lobster dishes rock as does the crab cakes. Make reservation and try this revived gem out soon. We will be back soon"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Five star potential.  We got hush puppies for the appetizer. I thought they were fine.. My husband loved them.   We each got a cup of the lobster bisque and it was mind-blowing! We added in the optional sherry and it was awesome. Big chunks of lobster.   For the entree, I got the lobster roll (yum!!) and it was outstanding. My husband had the shrimp and scallop Norfolk. Very good as well. Even the fries were delicious. Great value.  Overall, very impressed. 4/5 because the service was sooooooooooo slow and the presentation of some of the food was a little cheap-looking. (Sherry was in a plastic container, lobster roll was on a paper doily, packaged oyster crackers, fries kinda strewn on the plate w ketchup in a plastic container)  We will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"First time here since they opened in late August. Very nice decor. Open eating area with a large aquarium separating two areas.  Excellent service by our waitress Kelly. Really good appetizers. Very large menu from sea food to steaks and much more. Reasonable prices and will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Service and food were excellent. They've only been opened a week and still technically part of their soft opening. With that being said everything was spot on. Lobster Bisque and the Fried Clam Strips were really good.   Food came out quickly so is good for lunch as well as dinner."}
{"text":"We made our first visit to The Lobster Pot last night.  We heard that they had a good happy hour so we thought we'd check it out. Unfortunately, the happy hour isn't that great. Just $1 off drinks and $1 off four or five different appetizers. Since we were disappointed in the happy hour, we decided to order off the dinner menu. We split an order of the crab cakes appetizer, I had the lobster rolls and my husband had an oyster po boy. Both sandwiches came with french fries. The food and service was very good but it was a little too pricey for what we had. Along with a drink each, our bill was $65 with the tip. A little too high for two sandwiches with fries."}
{"text":"Overall, this place is fairly good, with a decent amount of seafood offerings, and of course... lobster! The interior is inviting and includes a full bar, and the service is sharp attentive. Honestly, there really aren't a large selection of seafood establishments in the Cleveland area, so if you're in the mood for some fish, shrimp, or lobster, and don't feel like going to Red lobster, be sure to try this place!"}
{"text":"So went here with some friends and I was excited to go to a seafood restaurant that was not a chain. I love sea food look at my reviews I mean I love it. I got the fisherman's platter and it was a greasy rubbery fail. And I know the problem they did not let the fryer come back up to temp before cooking. The other person got fish and chips and it was the same. The hush puppies were raw in the middle.. sucks really sucks I get better quality at ljs oh well. I know the person that reads theses leaves excuses don't bother won't change my mind or review"}
{"text":"We're still sitting in the Lobster Pot for tonight's dinner our waitress was Shauatay something like that spelled. Appetizers we had Lobster Rangoon dynamite and then we had those shrimp spicy again excellent. I had the whole Maine Lobster the only complaint I have is twofold one the butter dish never really got hot because the candle was so short that same thing with my wife who had lobster tails also I would recommend that you get a small Fork and a splitter cuz there was a lot of lobster I could not eat or get to. However everything else is just very nice very tasty and I would recommend it For dessert we had key lime pie and again that was very tasty and one of the best.the server didnt bring red skins out with dinner but promptly went for them.i did not receive my hot vegetables which i didnt say anything.when server returned  my credit card statement my card was not in folder. I notified her.momrnts later the card was found on the floor ."}
{"text":"The lobster tail was as good as you get on the coasts.  The bourbon chicken was excellent.  Clams were great as well and so was the perch.  Service was a touch slow but the servers are friendly and fun.  Loved the patio and will be back.  Highly recommend  Excellent dinner.  Best lobster in town.  The food is so fresh.  Seafood is very flavorful and the steaks are hand cut.  Cleveland does not have great seafood restaurants,  but this is one that is well worth it.    Service is very food as well.  A must try."}
{"text":"It seems like the owner want it to be a fancy restaurant, if you don't have reservations,they will let you sit at the bar area. The bartender was our waitress.when she was talking with us about \"daily special\",she was chewing gum.....emmm....seriously???? I ordered the salmon that from the daily special menu which cost$26. But what I get is such a little piece and nothing special.. even a nice decoration? I'd better go to Apple bee's.See the side fries...looks like they were using the dirty oil...They wanna show that they are a fancy restaurant by such high prices,but the quality of food didn't fit it at all. Do not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Lobster roll ok, fries not hot. Mariners platter was good scallops were not browned. Key lime pie was good. Will come again and glad to have a choice in the area."}
{"text":"Went to dinner with my husband for the first time and we will definitely be back.  The lobster roll is one of the best in Cleveland without a doubt! The octopus is also delicious and the price point is very family friendly.  And I can't neglect to mention the wonderful service!! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Had a little of just about everything  Fresh and delicious  Octopus was very good along with the soft shell crab and little neck clams. The King crab legs were good size and sweet. The snow crab was delicious along with the lobster tail. The Key lime pie was homemade and very good. The cheesecake was very rich but light. The pecan pie was homemade also and delicious as well. Atmosphere was good with friendly service"}
{"text":"Quite good. Ahi tuna appetizer was one of the best in recent memory.  Place was packed,  for good reason. Main dishes were the Norfolk shrimp and scallop pasta and the scallop salad. Both were very nice. Competent service and a good wine list/specialty drink menu. Would have given 5 stars except for the overwhelming fish aroma when entering. Didn't bother me as it reminded me of a Florida shrimp shack, but I could see how it could be off-putting for someone who wasn't ready for that. Oh, and the oysters Rockefeller were exceptional. Looking forward to returning for happy hour."}
{"text":"We are pleased with tbe service and the food was very good. We had the Clam chowder that was loaded with clams. Every dish was nicely presented. The scallops are great also. A very nice sea food restaurant!"}
{"text":"Can you say \"padded tip?\"  OK, maybe it was an honest mistake by our server \"Kevin S.\" but I travel extensively and I can't tell you how often I've had a server pad the tip despite the fact that I usually tip about 20%, unless the service is horrible.  In this case, I gave a $7.00 tip on a $36.92 dinner.  I guess that wasn't enough because he helped himself to another $1.  I've had this happen before - usually when I travel out of town.  I imagine they assume I won't be stopping back through to challenge it.  Food was pretty good except my coworker's chicken sandwich arrived without the chicken (pretty funny)."}
{"text":".wonderful seafood but our experience with the waiter was terrible. Just after we sat down, he asked what we wanted to drink. I said we hadn't had time to decide. He waited a minute or so and the said very gruffly,  \"I have other people to wait on. I can't just stand here while you make up your minds. When he came back he said there was a large party so that if we didn't order right away, we would have to wait another 45 min. For our food. Then he said, \"I will have to stack your appetizers, salads and entrees together or you will have to wait 45 minutes or more to eat\". The waiter was the most rude server I have ever experienced in all of my years of dining and I have been in all kinds of establishments. My son is trained in culinary arts so we always give people in the business the benefit of a doubt....but this was ridiculous. I wish the business well. We certainly need its good seafood in the area but we should not have to put up with rude, poor service. I will have to think twice before visiting again."}
{"text":"Outstanding meal at the Lobster Pot!  The spicy crispy shrimp as an appetizer was delicious and we would definitely order it on our next visit.    The fried shrimp dinner was not greasy but nicely crisp - really delicious.  The twin lobster tails were fresh and tasty and the fried perch was excellent.  The service was good being that they were still getting into the rhythm of a new restaurant.   Definitely a great addition to the neighborhood.  Will be back again this week.    Second Visit - not as good as the first visit.  All of the food was overcooked and tough.  The bugs need to be worked out a little quicker.  Kitchen timing is very off."}
{"text":"I made reservations for dinner with my parents to treat them for their anniversary. I must say it is quite difficult to spot this place. I recommend a bigger sign with heavier colors. It's tucked away inside a plaza. From the beginning the hostess was so sweet and polite. I was shocked. You don't see that too often anymore. She commented on my outfit and I appreciated that. It took a little while for the server to come over but she did say she wasn't sure if we were her table. She was sweet but not as attentive. I can be a harsh critic because I am a server myself but I can be the most understanding. I understand the industry and what servers come across. It's not an easy job. The atmosphere is nice but a little loud. Must be the high ceilings Omg the food! Holy yum! I ordered the calamari and hush puppies as an appetizer. The calamari was the best I've had. So tender and delicious. The garlic dip it comes with I would put on anything and everything. The hush puppies were good and came with a sriracha dipping sauce which wasn't too spicy which I appreciated. My dad ordered the bowl of clam chowder, we had to remind the waitress to bring it but it was worth the wait. Nice chunky and flavorful. Me and my mom got Caesar salads and my dad got the house salad. All very good as well. My dad and I got the lobster Newburg (sp?) it was lobster tossed in a lobster sauce and came on top of a lemon risotto. It was divine. My dad commented that it was a little salty but I don't mind salt. My mom had the fishermans platter. I had some of her scallops and French fries. The fries were delicious and hand cut! Yesss! And those scallops were the best I've tasted.  The prices maybe high for some people but I thought it was very reasonable for the amount and quality of food. I would highly recommend this place and already have. My co worker has already gone and enjoyed it greatly. I plan to be back to try other items and to eat that calamari again. Yumm!!"}
{"text":"We were very excited to try this place but were disappointed in the slow service and cold food. Don't go on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"The service was excellent and of course the food amazing. Very clean place. Bar tenders always making sure we were taken cared for. Is a must for sea food in the Cleveland Richmond heights area."}
{"text":"Very good meal.  We happened by and saw the new Lobster Pot and went in for lunch.  A bowl of lobster bisque was shared.  Very thick and good.  We both enjoyed it; but it seemed something was missing.  The sherry served with the soup was a new twist - we have never had that.   Walleye was a big piece and there was a very good amount of lobster in my pasta.  Large pieces.  Well worth the $16.00.  Husband has the Walleye and I had the Lobster Linguine - both the lunch special @ $16.00.  Came with cornbread and french bread.  My meal came with a salad and hubby had fries.  (no surprize there).    We shared a piece of Key Lime Pie - very good.  Best we've had in a while.  Lunch came to $56.00 before tip."}
{"text":"First time visiting and it was alright. I came to treat my parents out on a Tuesday night and wanted to get seafood. Nothing to write home about here so I'll get right to it.  It wasn't too busy but I saw that the waitress got double sat(I'm a server as well so I have a keen eye on these things) so it took a little while for her to greet us. No biggie. However she was a bit frazzled throughout the entire night. We ordered the octopus, calamari, and mussels. The Octopus was alright but it definitely was not worth $13(refer to the picture). It was one tentacle cut into 5 minuscule pieces on a bed of spinach. The mussels were ok but there was a pungent smell with them that was very unappealing. They might have been old. The calamari was good but if you can't do fried calamari right then you're in trouble.   Onto the entrees: we got the lobster rolls, ribeye, and lobster newburg(?). The lobster rolls were good however they didn't have enough mayo in them to give you that creamy/structure that it needed. The steak was good however the server forgot 2 sides. The lobster newburg was the best besides the other half of the puff pastry drowning in the sauce.   Overall it was an ok experience. I'm not sure if I'd go back at the moment because they have room for a lot of improvement. Service could be more attentive. Still tipped her 20% because you know, tip karma. It'll be awhile before I give it another chance(if I do)."}
{"text":"It was okay. I doubt I'll be back.. it was a pretty standard seafood place and it didn't blow me away. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing.. I got the crab cake sandwich. It wasn't bad but it wasn't very good. They have a treasure chest for kids filled with toys and the kids are allowed to take one on the way out. I thought that was pretty cute. Service was good."}
{"text":"I am sure once they work out some of the kinks w/getting things out of the kitchen on time & together to the table I will be able to give a better review .. overall the food was delicious .. but a few issues .. fried clam appetizer is plentiful & tasty but it arrived to the table room temp at best .. our entrees arrived w/out getting our salads prior .. asked the server where they were & were asked if we still wanted them (hmm .. I paid for them so I said we wanted them) .. they arrived as we were finishing our entrees .. right when my husband went to take his final sip of his beverage he noticed his glass was damaged & had a severe sharp edge on the rim/edge .. thankfully he did not cut himself but we did point it out to our server who said she would discard it .. took nearly 20 minutes to get our final check .. so food is good .. some was not warm enough but edible .. glass was a safety hazard & things ran slowly but I am gonna give it another try .. I am confident things will improve with time"}
{"text":"After reading some of the reviews I was skeptical about going, but so glad I gave them a try! Our waitress Alex was great! She was funny and engaging! We started with the hush puppies and garlic shrimp. They were very tasty. The shrimp was full of garlic and butter.  The king crab legs were on special and they were definitely worth the price. They were very sweet and filling! To top it all off we had the key lime pie. I must say it was soooo good! We are definitely putting on our list of favorite places."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Great happy hour especially Wednesday evenings. We love Alese as well as the rest of the staff. They are super accomodating and very friendly. Thumbs up to the general manager Odessa. Great job with customer service. Calamari is the best as well as other great selections. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"BEST SEAFOOD I've tried in Cleveland!  We arrived here recommended by Yelp, and one knows that sometimes the people's tastebuds are not as picky as one's tastebuds... So skepticism ensued...  Since we arrived at 11:30, they opened the restaurant for us and another group of ladies who where waiting outside since 11 or so. The place got busy really QUICK, which led us to believe that this is a place not only popular with people using Yelp, but also with senior customers, who made the majority of the customers. The place got 70% full within 20 minutes but that didn't stop our waitress from providing us EXCELLENT & FAST SERVICE.  The menu looked great and it was hard to decide which dish, but we didn't expect to hear a list of 6 SPECIALS OFF THE MENU called \"Catch of the day\" which we ended up getting. This decision made our visit worthwhile!  The Pan Seared Yellow fin Tuna ($27) was my choice. It comes served with a \"pasta\" made of vegetables, which has some onions, arugula, etc. The taste of the tuna left me ECSTATIC! I asked for a side of baked Brussel Sprouts and these couldn't have been more perfectly cooked. One of my companions ordered the grilled swordfish and some shrimp bisque and he loved it.  Even though we all were full, our waitress decided that we could eat more by tempting us with what she called \"The Best Key Lime Pie in Town\". We had to try it! Turned out to be good (for me) but according to one of my companions, it was indeed the best key lime pie he ever tasted!   The experience was probably enhanced by the fact that they were playing very nice music in the background, for example: Key lime pie while listening to the jazzy version of \"The Girl of Ipanema\" by Astrud Gilberto might have helped..  Like I said, we all have different tastebuds... However, I'M COMING BACK!"}
{"text":"Omg the ribeye was amazing. I couldnt even believe the size of it when they brought it to me. It was cooked spot on and delicious. Ohya did i mention the lobster tail that was extremely yummy. Cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"Seafood restaurant with more of the feel of a local hangout than upscale restaurant, with decor including a hanging rowboat and fishing nets. Service has been prompt and friendly. Quality of the food has been a little inconsistent. The gravlax appetizer is delicious, but the mussels were a little over cooked and underflavored. I had to ask for bread, but it came out warm and crusty with melted butter. The lobster rolls are good for the price (you get two!), and the oysters in the po-boy were plump and crisply fried. I've been a little less impressed with the entrees (lobster newburg was a little over cooked and risotto was salty), but we'll definitely be back for the items they do well."}
{"text":"Had the twins lobster tails and filet!!! It was good.. Food Not what exactly what i expected, but was good.. Would be willing to give it another try.. Think i would try the whole lobster next time before the tails"}
{"text":"This place is awesome if you're ever in the area!! Amazing customer service and delicious food! I recommend the Garlic Shrimp Sauté! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"First time at the Lobster Pot, but won't be the last.  We sat at the bar and  were attended to by a delightful server. We both order specials, I had the swordfish and my wife had broiled Lake Erie perch. Both were excellent, with a choice of sides.  My finished with the Key Lime pie, which she really liked. The menu is very extensive so lots of reasons to return."}
{"text":"Enjoyed ladies night drink and dessert specials last night. I ordered a light fare of appetizers which included blue point oysters on the half shell, grilled octopus, and escargot. It all went well with my favourite pairing for sweet and buttery seafood- Corona beer with a lime. If not a Corona, I recommend a good Reisling.   The oysters we perfectly sweet and offered with dressings of mignionette, horseradish, cocktail sauce, and a wedge of lemon. Sublime! Well shucked and fresh. Escargot and octopus were also very enjoyable and I only wish the octopus was more than one tendril a plate. (Yes, I know it's an appetizer..) I liked it so much.  Specials posted are barside only but was well worth it. I enjoyed my bartender's personable and friendly service and the comfortable seating around their extensive bar, decorated with a tasteful nautical theme.   I highly recommend this place for an intimate dinner. Lights are dimmed low and the ambiance is lovely as table settings were beautifully done for the evening.  Lastly, I recommend the keylime pie to round out your meal. As a part-time Floridian, I give it my seal. I am told that this pie and the pecan pie are both made in house. Just the right amount of tartness. You must give it a try :)   I will make sure to bring Best with me the next time I stop by."}
{"text":"This is a hidden jem.  Great seafood.  Lobster was fantastic.  Frog legs was wonderful.  Crab legs were amazing.  Service was top notch."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate my dad's birthday, had a late lunch on Friday, everything was delicious. We started out with crab cakes for an appetizer - really good. I had the maple salmon special with red skins potatoes. The fish was perfectly cooked, tasted fresh, portion was just enough. My dad had the twin lobster tails and he thought they were nicely done as well.   Good beer and wine list, beers were cold and very reasonably priced. The hostess and our waitress were very nice and service was fantastic.   Overall, I really enjoyed our meal and will be back to try the something else. The Lobster Pot is a nice, refreshing change of pace with a simple menu filled with familiar, fresh, delicious food!"}
{"text":"The service was very good. Kept up with our table very well. Went on a Saturday night, so it was busy but everything went well. The food is delicious. I recommend it if you are a seafood person! Only thing I was not happy with was the initial hostess greeting. Not very personable or friendly."}
{"text":"Exceptional!  Service was excellent and the Shrimp and Scallop Norfolk was delicious. I will be back."}
{"text":"I will preface this review by saying, I hate leaving negative reviews. And honestly the only reason I am is because the place isn't cheap in the slightest, and for the kind of money we spent last night I'd expect the meal to be at least decent. Our server was wonderful. As a matter of fact everyone we came in contact with was extremely pleasant. (Including who I can only assume was the owner walking around talking to customers) My husband and I got ahi tuna as an appetizer along with a bowl of lobster bisque. The flavor was great on the bisque, but it was barely warm. The tuna was ok, but room temperature and kind of mushy. Which means it wasn't very fresh. We both hot filets with redskins, and honestly it was one of the worst steaks we've both ever had. It had zero flavor! And again, was basically like warm. It was a great cut of meat, but cooked badly. I shouldn't have to pit A-1 on a $35 steak. And even the potatoes were barely warm. I get my steak rare and expect a cool center, but it wasn't cooked rare. It was medium at best, and not good. We both got a add on. My husband hot king crab legs and I got shrimp. And AGAIN, it was barely warm. When our waitress asked how our food was, we did tell her and she offered to have new ones made. We told her no because we didn't have time and honestly having worked in the industry, I don't return food in case you get an angry cook who doesn't like you've complained and is than handling your food. (It DOES happen) Our waitress felt badly, and gave us a free dessert to take with us for our troubles. It wasn't her fault at all, and I felt bad she was panicky about it. It didn't reflect on her at all. So to end this review, when you spend over $150 for dinner you expect it to be good. And literally none of it was. Maybe we caught them on an off night, but we left very disappointed."}
{"text":"I visited Lobster Pot Saturday for the first time for a funeral lunch. The food was delicious, but I received what very much seemed to be racist treatment. I, a black woman, came in support of my boyfriend, who is white. I was the only black person in this funeral group. The lunch was a buffet. Me and about 5 others ordered drinks when we first arrived. The server brought everyone their drinks except me. He went back to the kitchen after delivering them and then came back empty handed, so I brought it to his attention that he \"forgot\" my water. He then brought the water. Later that evening, the person next to me ordered another drink and then I did as well. The waiter turned to me and said \"anything for you.\" I thought it was sweet. But then he came back to the table with only the other persons drink. This person was sitting right next to me. There's no way he could have just forgotten my drink a second time. Nobody else at the table had this experience."}
{"text":"4 of us had drinks, apps, entrees, & dessert and it was all fantastic! Sat at a bar table so we could keep an eye on the Cavs game. The waitress was friendly & efficient, one of the owners went table to table checking on things, & best of all? Great. Seafood. I rate a lot based on raw oysters & they are top notch here - ordered chilled raw, as well as grilled (1st time for that!) & both were perfect texture with excellent flavor & accompanied by proper accoutrements. Entrees at the table were from the fresh catch list: perch, walleye, & swordfish, along with a Newburg that was loaded with hunks of good stuff! 2 opposing desserts were perfect together: key lime pie & dark chocolate layer cake. Great ending to a great meal for all of us. See ya again soon!"}
{"text":"OMG! The new Lobster Pot would not seat me. I walked into the restaurant. There was one couple waiting to be seated and when I requested \"two please\" the lady told me that they were no longer seating and i could look at a to go menu. I scanned the restaurant and it was busy but not totally full. THEN they seated the couple who were on the bench. Did I mention that i was the only African American there?!? I shared my concern and the man had the nerve to say he has a black best friend. I told him that was so cliche.  The lady said they were out of food. I asked why did she give me a menu and she said \"to look at\". This was at 830pm and i am in the lot typing this review.  BTW I see people going in.  I believe that if i were white i would have been seated"}
