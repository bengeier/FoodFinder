{"text":"Love this restaurant for breakfast.  Service is great.  It is a family owned restaurant.  Everyone there is so friendly.  Highly recommend the place. for breakfast, lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Its loyal customers probably say the most for Cookhouse.  At breakfast or lunch (I have never been there for dinner) there is always a good crowd, when other restaurants in the area are close to empty.  Nothing about the place is stylish or young.  The extensive menu of predictable items indicates accurately that innovation and culinary excellence are not the goals.  But everything I have eaten there tastes very good.  It is freshly made, hot, well prepared, and well-seasoned.  The service is always excellent.  The prices are modest.  The familiar style of Cookhouse would usually be associated with an older crowd and a slower pace.  No doubt there is some of that at Cookhouse, but from my observation, it also is probably the most popular spot in Cornelius for a power breakfast or lunch.  There is a lot of commerce, and a lot of politicking,  going on in those booths and tables."}
{"text":"Do not waste your money here! They don't care about customers. First, they have a patio but they either won't let you on it or if they do, they complain that they forget customers out there and didn't put sunscreen on... get rid of the patio then! Second, I told the waitress the coffee was so weak it tasted like tea. Instead of fixing the issue, she laughed in our faces. Don't waste your time and money on this shithole for the rude service and less than average food. Even Waffle House is better."}
{"text":"This is my regular place for dinner two times per week. Not fancy but good food and friendly service."}
{"text":"Came here with family for a low key late breakfast on Tuesday morning. There were a good number of people here, but they weren't full and there was no wait.  I ordered The Americana which was 2 pancakes, 2 eggs (I picked over easy) and 2 sausage patties (you can sub bacon). It arrived in good time and was decent. The eggs were perfectly cooked. The pancakes were tasty as well. The sausage was a little dry, but syrup fixed that. Coffee was good and refills were timely.  Family ordered omelettes and grits. I tasted the grits and they were just ok. One got a Greek omelette that was stuffed with feta. Too? much for her taste.   Overall it felt like a dinner from back home (NJ). The staff was friendly and the place was welcoming. I would definitely go here again!"}
{"text":"I had a horrible experience at this restaurant.  I'm not one to complain, but I've never been to a place where the food was so bad I would't eat any of it.  The onion rings I ordered were bland, soggy, and falling apart.  I ordered chicken fried chicken that was a big lump of grease, it had no taste, and the white gravy on top was disgusting.  This is southern dining at it's worse.  I was very dissapointed."}
{"text":"This is a racist piece of crap restaurant with terrible service and an owner who didn't care. Will never return."}
{"text":"About as Southern as my underwear made in China.   Unfriendly is putting it mildly.... rude from start to finish.   Southern?   English was a second language to the entire staff. Will not speak of other's food at our table.   I had the Wed. special of Pot Roast with mixed veggies and potato salad.   Nasty sweet 'sauce'  (not a gravy) could not chew beef and potatoes taste like old socks.   Mixed veggies were frozen and boiled and potato salad was obviously delivered in a tub.   On a scale of 1-10 eat the fast food crap down the street......"}
{"text":"Stopped by for (10am) weekday breakfast.  Seating was fast.  Staff was nice and efficient.    No frills local restaurant with classic Greek family-owned place specializing in low-price and big quantity, above quality ingredients  and careful cooking. Coffee was weak, but decent-- big plus is they supplied small pitcher of fresh milk, not the \"khemical kreamers\" of most NC joints. Had a yearning for pancakes, so got the AMERICANA special with 2 scrambled eggs, 2 sausage patties and 2 pancakes.  Pancakes were largish, fluffy and very standard tasting-- reminding me of beach pancakes as a kid.  Not much taste, but goodish.  Syrup was flavorless cheapo Sysco by the gallon.  Butter was \"butter-flavored spread' in a container.  Did have a smidge of butter flavor.  Sausage patties were cooked to shoe leather consistency, but had a decent taste.  Eggs looked like they had been microwaved, as in one oblong fluffy blob.  They were super hot, like microwaved.  Could have been from a Sysco egg mix.  Almost no taste or mouth appeal.  Price was just $5.99, but with tax and tip, still $10 breakfast.  I could have cooked better at home for $2.50.  Not really worth going out to, except in a pinch or for cheapskates who hate to cook or pay for decent food.  Lord knows that's most people."}
{"text":"Food is good, not great.  Portions are larger, and food is quality.  We'll go back."}
{"text":"Service was slow, and low sanitation rating-90.0. Food was decent, but most likely will not be back."}
{"text":"Where do I begin- My husband and I walked through the door to an almost empty restaurant and waited to be seated. One employee glanced at us and kept it moving. Finally a server walked up and said 'two?' So our adventure began. He ordered hot cakes with eggs and turkey sausage and I had their farmers omelet with hashbrowns. Both of us had cranberry juice. The juice was a mixture of nasty water and juice. His sausage tasted generic and eggs had slice of cheese on top- partially melted. My omelet- same cheese and in a nutshell, horrible! Hopefully, We will not get food poisoning like the last reviewer!!"}
{"text":"Really inconsistent service and food. This place is near our house so we pass it often, but we have to leave enough time between visits to forget the details of the last dining experience.  The atmosphere is like eating in your elderly aunt's living room: dark floral wallpaper and dirty dark carpeting. The service on our last visit was absolutely terrible -- we literally started to wonder if our waitress had just up and quit because it was so long before we saw her at all.   The food is average diner fare: no surprises and no delight, just fuel for the body.  But the prices are great: you can get two complete dinners for $12, which I suppose accounts for why this place stays in business."}
{"text":"Let me preface by saying I'm reviewing for breakfast only. Really, I wouldn't come here for lunch or dinner anyway. I've been looking for a new breakfast place as I'm thoroughly unimpressed by other breakfast joints in the area. Not sure why this place only has three stars because I really enjoyed it.   We came around 11 on a Thursday. It wasn't very busy but they seemed to be recovering from the breakfast rush and it picked up around noon for the lunch rush.   I got the Hellenic omelette, which they claim as their house speciality. I absolutely loved it. No joke, this is one of the best omelettes I've ever had. It included smoked ham, feta cheese, peppers and onions. It came with hash browns and a biscuit. The omelette was delicious and the hash browns and biscuit were good.   If I remember correctly, our server's name was Katie. She was very good and attentive. Our glasses were never empty.   The popular breakfast place in the area is Toast, and cookhouse absolutely blows Toast away. Cookhouse had the best breakfast food in the area and we'll be back."}
{"text":"Today must have been a bad day for everyone at the Cookhouse. Food was okay and the owner looked like she was pissed off and so did our waitress. I guess everyone is entitled to a bad day."}
{"text":"If you rated this above a 3 i seriously question your sanity.   WORST customer service i've ever had (based off two experiences).  I mean really obviously rude and not helpful. How is this place still in business???? Wow!  I don't have a lot of time but beware, do not eat here! trust me on that!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful Southern breakfast, Great biscuits and gravy, grits everything that is good about starting the day!  We had a great waiter and even coffee to go free of charge we will be back for sure.  Love it!"}
{"text":"The food here wasn't amazing but decent and fairly priced. But the service was extremely slow, we sat for nearly 20 minutes before our drink orders were taken. Our waiter dropped the food off at the table and promptly left before we could even ask for extra napkins, utensils, sauces, etc. Excessive amounts of time passed between each visit from the waiter, nobody even got a refill because by the time he returned to our table our food was finished and we were ready for our checks. The food doesn't even make it worth it to return!"}
{"text":"We found this gem while scouting out the Charlotte area before we moved.  We ended up living just down the road, and though we recently moved a few exits away, we try to get breakfast there every week.  If you go, make sure to ask for Dan, but he isn't available, all the staff are awesome and they make you feel like family!"}
{"text":"Awful customer service! The owner lady at the front is just rude. Food wasn't anything great either. Tried twice, will not be back."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food at a family owned and run restaurant.  The Greek baked chicken was perfectly seasoned. My wife got eggs Benedict and said they were prepared just the way she hoped.  I will definitely go back.  The restaurant was busy on a weekend late morning, but the wait was short.  If you are around Cornelius I recommend stopping by for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"We use to love going there but recently we ordered the Eggs Benedict and they use Bearnaise Sauce instead of TRADITIONAL Hollandaise Sauce...it was horrible. I mentioned it to the waitress and her response was that they just changed it to that. I don't know if they don't know the difference or they ran out of Hollandaise or what...but it should have been mentioned to us when we ordered because the Menu says Hollandaise Sauce. I even mentioned it to the owners and they just kinda ignored me. Not good customer service. Other than that the food is good for breakfast but they need to change that menu item and be honest about it!"}
{"text":"Been eating here for 15 years or so. Extensive menu, consistently good food with Breakfast served all hours."}
{"text":"The CookHouse family restaurant serves breakfast, lunch and dinner, but there is a reason they are known as the 'Home of the country breakfast.'  It's because they serve one. And it's darn good. Country gravy biscuits, bacon, sausage and eggs.  They serve other breakfast plates too, which are equally darn good.  I admit to only having had breakfast at the CookHouse, so I cannot speak to their lunch and dinner items. However, a quick browse of the menu shows everything from sammiches and burgers to steaks, seafood and pasta.  Breakfast is their claim to fame though, and its offered all day long! Who doesn't love breakfast for dinner?   Fried chicken fillet with biscuits, egg and southern gravy (The Dixie); Ham, bacon, country ham, sausage (patties & links) and eggs (Olympic Boy).  Or throw in some hash browns with country gravy, an omelette and some pancakes.   It may not make your doctor or your waistline happy, but your tastebuds will be whistling Dixie."}
{"text":"Big improvement over the past year.  Going from one individual who the world roatated around to a shared management approach  Much better in terms of service etc.  I hope it continures in the future"}
{"text":"This is a great place for casual dining.  The gyro is the best I've had and I order it every place I go.  Breakfast is simple and tasty.  I am a fan of the omelettes and my husband loves the pancakes.  If you want a nice affordable meal give them a try :-)"}
{"text":"Very dissapointing. Enjoyed nothing about our visit.  Mediocre food, grumpy staff, outdated interior."}
{"text":"I was very comfortable eating in this place!  Not the typical \"Family Style\" \"Diner\" this place has a bit more Charm than I expected or deserve (I'm totally OK with more than I deserve ALL the Time). Quite a bit nicer in decor, a little darker (though it's not hip) with more Character and the Patrons (well some of them) not the typical \"Family Style Diner\"customers at all (that I have ever seen except the ones I bring)! \"Breakfast served all Day\" Hope these folks are regulars! !! !!!!  How about something you can not get everyday here and and even if it were not \"Complementary\" (hey someone needs to make a list) it was so good I would call it Mad Hatters Clam Chowder.  So good I would have payed for it, free soup to start your meal.  Last time it was Potato Leek or something like that and it was good.  This Manhattan Clam Chowder was five yelp stars Delicious, though I almost do not mention it since they do not always have it!  Most of the time I eat in a place like this \"Greek owned Family Style Diner\" I want to see how the Spaghetti with Meat Sauce tastes...This Meat Sauce is one of the best I've tasted!  This is Flavorful Full of FLAVOR and gets 4.85 yelp stars in my book, though from there it goes downhill fast!  The Meat Sauce was so good ( I have ordered it twice) though the critical part of my review starts now:  the Pasta was the typical over soaked though well drained (thank you for draining the pasta).  I do not give stars for well drained pasta, yet I'll give a few points!  The Fried Squash and the thick cut the batter is thick. Onion Rings were perfectly cooked though the batter was too thick for me.  The Spinach had a great flavor though a bit too salty.  The Cucumber Salad was about what I expected.    The Service was friendly, helpful and reserved, almost Superboy on Greek Family Dinning and that is a compliment!"}
{"text":"This is simply the best breakfast in the area. Not sure that I would attempt any other meal beyond a sandwich. The coffee is nothing to write home about (but its about a buck cheaper than Toast) . The omelets are great and the French toast specials are more food than you can eat without opening your belt. The men's room could be a little bigger, and warmer, and less smelly, but just hold it until you get home."}
{"text":"Nasty! Shabby place with shabby taste. Had breakfast here with my family. The biscuits were like hockey pucks, the omelet was overcooked and subpar, my daughter's applesauce was so runny it was like juice, the toast was stale, and the water tasted like it was pulled straight from Lake Norman. Not a place I will ever revisit or recommend."}
{"text":"I have been here for breakfast and lunch.  Both times with a GroupOn.   The food is constant and tasty.  No complaints with the food.  The service is always with a smile.   Cookhouse is already an inexpensive joint perfect for taking the whole family, so using a GroupOn, makes it very cost effective.   The menu is family style type food, sort of like southern comfort food."}
{"text":"we come here for breakfast quite often.    Ample portions, at reasonable prices.   A quality place for casual dining."}
{"text":"I WILL NEVER COME BACK HERE. Food was ok other than my country style steak was red. Waitress was rude (older woman grey hair). The woman at the front desk though??? She has to be part owner. I honestly dont think any other place would hire her. I had to wait to pay out wait to get seated theres 6 tables in the place and im alone. The waitress didnt even know the menu!?!? I liked this place the first time I came the waiter was actually pretty cool the food was good. If youre reading this go to prosciuttos right across the parking lot."}
{"text":"The food here is good, but I'm rating this establishment  3 stars for their management. I ordered an omelet without the usual green peppers and onions, and instead requested spinach. We noticed a $2 up charge for adding spinach. When I raised this concern with the manager who was running the register, he was unwilling to make an adjustment. To add to this, we have eaten here regularly for years. If you are willing to order from the menu and make no modifications, you'll be fine. But next time, I'm bringing my own spinach (which I can buy for $2.50 a bag!)!!!"}
{"text":"The food was good. Loved the lobster bisque. The mashed potatoes are real, the white gravy is good, and the portions are huge. Will be back."}
{"text":"I could discuss all of my past visits here, or the wallpaper, but I'd prefer to just talk about the one event that stopped me from returning.  Recently after dining in, I brought my lunch ticket up to the counter (from a table for two).  The cashier (early/mid-20's, white - obviously the daughter of the owner, because no one else would hire this thing) did not speak, but shoved her hand out at me.  I handed her my receipt, assuming that's what the mute wanted.  I then told the child that it was two separate tickets.  Her response baffled me.  \"18 or 2?\"  Silence on my end.  \"Which is your ticket?!\" (think teenager-y \"ugh\" tone).  \"I had the Fried Chicken Tenders,\" I responded, still with no idea what '18 or 2?' meant.  In the best aggravated voice she could muster: \"EIGHTEEN or TWO?!\"  I was not going to respond to this moronic girl.  Only after looking down at the receipt in her hand did I realize she was actually asking me the MENU numbers for the items we ordered.  So, EVERY person that came through that restaurant on that day was required to memorize the menu numbers of the items they ordered?  I didn't say another word to the rude cashier, and some homeless-looking man walked up behind her and told her that #18=chicken tenders meal (my order, the one I had nearly choked to death on, but I won't blame that on them too).  She then laid a credit card receipt on the counter, didn't tell me to sign it, and kept ringing up the next 10 people in line.  No \"thanks, have a nice day\".  Why would a restaurant stick the dumbest person they could find at the front desk?  Wouldn't you want someone with manners representing your restaurant?  I could go back for mediocre food, but if I want that, I'll stick with Acropolis.  At least they force a smile there, rather than a smirk."}
{"text":"Badass breakfast for reasonable price. We are from Chicago where breakfast rules and many places like this exist. This is the only true \"Greek dinner\" in the area. If you want a solid breakfast for a very reasonable deal...go here. Get the Hellenic omelette with smoked sausage. I will refund your money if you don't think it is the best breakfast food you have had in NC.    I have had lunch and dinner here as well a couple times and it will not disappoint.  If you are looking for some pretentious Charlotte gastropub...this is not the best place, but if you want dam good food for people who know what their are doing, GO HERE."}
{"text":"Love the Greek salad with chicken."}
{"text":"This place is a home cooking gem. If you are expecting white table tops you are in the wrong place. This place has amazing food, amazing portions, nice employees and is an absolute secret gem to Cornelius. Biggest breakfast and dinners around. Low price, large portions. Southern hospitality. A win. Not sure how its lower than 5 stars."}
{"text":"Stopped by for Saturday morning breakfast with my husband and 3 year old son. The server was very nice and friendly, but didn't know the menu well. My husband and I ended up getting The Delight omelette and our son got a pancake with eggs and sausage. The food was fairly generic; reminded me of the cafeteria food at work. My omelette was modified a bit (mushrooms instead of tomatoes) and ended up giving me food poisoning, so it was definitely not a \"delight\"; my son complained all day about his little belly hurting. The three of us ate for less than $25, but would've honestly been better off grabbing breakfast at McDonald's. I can say with 100% certainty that we will not be back...there are far too many other tasty, locally-sourced options in the area to settle for this place."}
{"text":"Very homey restaurant....the price was reasonable.   The pancakes are very good and so is the sourdough bread.  For the price the portions are great...and you won't leave hungry!"}
{"text":"What happened to the hash browns?  Used to be the best in Charlotte, now not good."}
{"text":"Great for Breakfasts...I LOVE PANCAKES!  Have yet to go for dinner but they run a special diner kind of special 2 dinners for like $12, complete with a scoop of ice cream...back to breakfast, I dare you to find a better stack of pancakes...if you are gonna carb out...go there...ham & cheese omlet is tasty as well, ask for the hash browns crispy/well done , trust me...and don't want to change out of those jammies in the morning? Don't worry-they have take out and it's very easy!"}
{"text":"There's something about walking into a slightly dated eatery and seeing an old school dessert case w/syran wrap desserts....reminds me of Gramma & makes me feel all warm and fuzzy. The staff enhances this feeling w/their welcome and familiar style. Everyone is a friend,  everyone is 'honey' and 'sweetie' and well behaved kids are enjoyed by staff and most patrons.   This was our first visit (thanks Yelpers!) and my husband is already claiming Cookhouse as a regular haunt for our Sunday mornings out. Today we had: Two of the 2 Egg Breakfasts (one w/bacon, one w/corned beef hash) and a child's order of French Toast (that totally woulda fed me!)  Though my eggs were cold, they were the size of pteradactyl eggs and they were cooked to a perfect 'over medium'. Hubs said the hash was good, though a bit overcooked. The hashbrowns were perfectly prepared and have more meat to 'em than your typical super skinny shreds of tater. The french toast was very good. The bene I saw float past on it's way to another diner looked delish and the plate was soon empty, so I'm guessin' there weren't any complaints.   With two adult meals, a kiddie meal and two fountain drinks, the grand total w/tax was a whopping $16.66. With tip we got out for $20 for a family of four (3yo and 1yo shared). We'll be back and look fwd to trying some southern style dinner!"}
{"text":"If you are really starving, you might not want to visit this place on Saturday or Sunday morning, especially with a crowd over 2. It's pretty packed and you are lucky if you get cream for your coffee! Actually, a couple times my food came out hot, and was delicious, however, other times--not so much."}
{"text":"Its good, i hated the hashbrows, oily and the kind you get frozen like waffle house. The eggs benedict were bery good, perfect eggs. The waffle is kinda tasteless and dense. Our waitress was delightful. Got to add, inside is kinda outdated, ripped seating but the bar area looks nicer. Cheap too"}
{"text":"You know, it is sad when you are wanting vegetables and there are so few places to get them.  In this area, Cookhouse is one of the few place to get veggies and though they aren't out of this world, they are still pretty good.  We always tend to order off of the daily menu, so we've never order off the regular menu.  They have different vegetable specials each day and offer breakfast anytime.  Again, nothing spectacular and reminds me of places I used to visit with my grandmother, but if you want veggies there aren't many other choices.  Check them out for yourself but I can only vouch for the daily menu, nothing else."}
{"text":"Great breakfast! I usually order the Hellenic Omelet with smoked sausage."}
{"text":"Wow! Just got back from Cookhouse and couldn't wait to write this review. Went here craving a country breakfast and was incredibly and pleasantly surprised. I ordered the All American which was 2 pancakes, 2 eggs anyway you want and really good bacon. It's such a cute mom & place that makes you wanna put your hands together and say your grace. I asked my waitress to leave the menu on the table after I ordered because they're so much to choose from for lunch and dinner (trying to preview for my next trip).  The restaurant is large with several different dining rooms and an outdoor patio area. Walked out for 11 bucks including tip. Awesome!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a great breakfast!  Their grits are really great, the breakfasts meats are really good too we had the sausage patties and ham...both very flavorful.  Pancakes are good as well and the service is friendly.  Definitely want to try some more of their menu.  Prices are super low.  Try it!"}
{"text":"I have  been eating at Cookhouse for years and it's a reliable place to grab an inexpensive but tasty meal. The service is generally quite good, and they'll usually get  you in and out fairly quickly, but they won't rush you out either.  Tonight I had  one of the specials- baked chicken with stuffing. I chose fried squash and mashed potatoes as my sides. All specials and many of the regular dinners come with a cup of soup. Tonight's soup was potato leek. Not my favorite of their soups, but not bad. Dinners also come with rolls and cornbread. All of this was $6,99. With a drink and tip it came to about 12 bucks. The chicken was very good- nice and moist and flavorful. The  sides were good too.  This isn't a fancy place, but it's what I call a real place. And you can't beat the prices, really."}
{"text":"Came here for Father's Day.  Three other tables were being used not including ours.    This review is based on the food and service.    The food is good.  They have an extensive menu that includes breakfast.  I think some things may be homemade, most isn't.   The waiter we had was just awful.  Very very rude Never had a smile on his face nor did he know how to say thank you.   Our table had manners as he did not.  Also had to get him several times to place our order and to refill drinks.   Also had to get the lady at the counter to refill drinks.  Poor unhappy help, will and looks like, he will single handedly drive this place into the ground.    A happy occasion was not a happy occasion.  We didn't let this guy ruin it for us.  He can ruin his own. Never ever, like ever, going back to this place."}
{"text":"First and the last time will eat at this establishment. I wanted to try this place because it offered home style cooking and was close to where I live. My husband ordered Countryboy breakfast and I ordered Racers choice. The eggs were the only thing that tasted fresh and cooked well. The meat here is very bad! I tasted my husbands ham because he thought it tasted funny. He was right! I chewed it alittle and spit it out. It tasted like it was spoiled. The restaurant  needs to be cleaned better and fix the broken decor. The server was friendly and did a good job. The southern cooking restuarants back in Florida we're so much better. The portions were heartier. The meat was fresh and delicious. They took more pride in keeping the restaurant cleaned for a better experience."}
{"text":"In this area there just aren't many breakfast places. This is one of them. Usually a long wait to get in on Sat/Sun until noon. Just be prepared for that but it's that way anywhere else. The service is fine-not special and not bad. The food is good. Great portions, standard fare. Omelettes are their best dish--standard fillings plus some different ones. I liked it."}
{"text":"We stopped in for our first visit and we have to say: we will NEVER be back!! Waited TWENTY minutes to be greeted and were only greeted after we told the cashier we were still waiting (which all she had to say was, \"he's busy\". He finally came over and was ALL attitude! \"I guess you guys are ready to order?\"  We just left. No apology. Nothing other than, \"well, I was busy.\"  This, of course, was after he rolled his eyes and huffed. Our children even asked why they were so rude! Unreal."}
{"text":"This was a delicious cookhouse I go here almost every morning and the waiters come right away at the beginning then it takes a while to get the food almost 10-20 minutes. I think that this place needs to have some more kid features to it, they used to have lollipops but now they don't and I am really upset. The waiters are very very nice though too!! This place is a 4 star rating (this is the Duke and no one takes our crown!!)"}
{"text":"I am writing this review after what transpired yesterday at CH. I have been dining here for many years with my elderly mom without any issues. Yesterday we arrived at a few minutes after 6 and the dining room had maybe 3 more tables occupied. We placed our order as more patrons continued to arrive. At exactly 6:57, over 50 minutes of waiting for a Greek salad, baked potato and BLT, I walked to the counter to inquire about our dinner. The owner, a large older lady was checking someone out so I did not interrupt, however, she turned to me and gave me this look like, what the hell do you want. I proceeded to ask her, \"Was there a problem in the kitchen, we've been waiting over 50 minutes for our order.\" Her reply, and in a very unwelcoming manner, Do you see all those people in there? They are waiting too. We are busy! There is nothing wrong in the kitchen, we are busy! They are doing their best. I was so taken back that I walked off without uttering a word. However, I decided very quickly that it was not worth the wait, and not worth being talked to in such a distasteful and disrespectful manner. I retrieved my mom and walked out the door telling the owner, \"We're going to make you less busy.\" Instantly she started yelling telling me how rude I am, ranting and raving like a crazy women, and regretfully, I chimed in...yes, my red-headed Scottish heritage surfaced and it was two crazy women exhibiting very unladylike behavior. I regret that...I really do. Clearly, this lady has health issues and should not be working the front. And clearly, they need additional help in the kitchen to properly take care of customers. We left and went to Big Bites and I had my Greek salad and mom had her BLT...and our time together went on without any other glitches..."}
{"text":"We came in for a luncheon date to use my friends Groupon deal  First the waitress acted as she would rather had us go somewhere else , we ordered the country fried steak and mashed potatoes and Lima beans  She ordered a steak medium well  The steak was way over cooked and was very chewy so they asked her would she like something else she ordered the pot pie which was Home style I don't know why but prison food looks better it was a big scoop of can veggies and added some few other veggies no breading on the pot pie also the country fried steak was about as bland as a nursing home this place has went down hill since last time we ate there staff is Different and rude and not helpful food quality is way down now I wander why they only have around 6 -8 people during 12 lunch hour take this off Groupon before someone else is wasting money"}
{"text":"F & L (first and last) for us. Hardly OK food, atmosphere is depressing.  Am I missing something some of these other reviews sound as if they were at a different place altogether."}
{"text":"Really good breakfast food- I had the Country Boy. Scrambled eggs, hash browns, bacon, sausage, country ham, and biscuits. Awesome waiter today! Didn't get to catch his name. Had a New York-type Italian accent. Decorated and furnished like my grandmothers house. Reminds me of home!"}
{"text":"Its was ok. The breakfast was fine but my tomato juice was sour so I had to send it back. Its has a nice diner feel and the price were fine. I might try it again"}
{"text":"My mom and I checked this place out today. It was Sunday around noon. There was about four parties ahead of us but we were seated in under 10 minutes. As we were walking to our table I noticed there were a lot of empty tables with dirty dishes left behind. Meanwhile there were people waiting at the front. Seemed like this place wasn't properly staffed.   We ordered gyros. They were okay. Our fries weren't salted. I probably wouldn't come back here. The food was nothing great and there are other options around. Service was kind of slow"}
{"text":"My favorite home-style food restaurant. Great price. Never disappoints. Owners and family are cool. Service is fast. They are obviously passionate about serving a good product and that's what is important!"}
{"text":"It has taken too many years for me to visit this Greek-run restaurant.  I kept seeing it listed in the local newspaper and had to look up the location.  I  determined I had seen the restaurant when visiting Sangum Indian Cuisine.  The ad said they served breakfast all day so I made a mental and written note.   There were never many cars on that side of the parking lot but they were open and I said let's go.  It was early afternoon and we still wanted a breakfast meal.  We arrived at Cookhouse and again, there were few cars in the lot on their side.  We were greeted promptly and seated by a window.  There were a few tables of hungry patrons.  We ordered breakfast and it came fairly quickly.  I ordered the All American Combo with two eggs your way, two pancakes, and bacon ($6.49) - see photos.  That was all I needed.  We dove in and were quite pleased with everything we ordered.  I also ordered a side of apple sticks and they tasted just like dessert!  They would be really yummy with ice cream on top, but I digress.  All in all, this is a great place for breakfast any time of the day.  The overall menu is varied, like a diner.  Even if I am not interested in breakfast, I will definitely stop by Cookhouse for another meal."}
{"text":"A classic breakfast place. Good service, large portions, and tasty grub. Ask for a table or you'll play booth backrest wars with your neighbor.   It was worth stopping by."}
{"text":"I can see how there are such varying opinions on this place.  In my mind I've always had good breakfasts here but, the lunches I've gotten have always been middle of the road at best and, the service can range from a sunny disposition to a series of scowls and grunts. When I add it all up, I land on A-OK with the knowledge that any particular visit might range from 1 star to 5 stars depending on the combo of all the aforementioned variables.  The only thing I don't like for breakfast is the way they serve deep fried hash brown patties as their breakfast potato offering.  Beyond that though, the rest of the fair is good and man is it cheap! It is a favorite spot when I have a houseful of teenagers who wind up spending a Friday night at our house and I want to be nice Mr. T and take my sons and the crew out for breakfast on Saturday morning.  They are always happy as hell and I get off having spent just a few bucks for a ridiculous amount of food.  For lunches it's mainly a country cooking type menu with just average food but, serviceable if I'm in the mood for some liver and onions and don't feel like driving any further than Cornelius for it.  Beyond that, I have what I'm sure is a pretty accurate picture of a store room filled with big cans of green beans and the other sides they offer with their version of a meat and three.  Cookhouse has been open since we moved here 11 years ago so, I suppose their overall formula serves them well."}
