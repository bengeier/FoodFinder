{"text":"Very good food. Service very friendly. Food took a little long but worth it. Also really great prices. Happy hour everyday!"}
{"text":"The place is nice to look at... Updated and clean. The food isn't good in my opinion. I have tried it three times and haven't enjoyed anything much. Pizza crust is always a little burned and all three times our order was messed up. There aren't a lot of options in downtown Mesa so I wanted it to be good but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Found this place in downtown Mesa. Cool atmosphere and absolutely delicious vegan pizza."}
{"text":"Swung in for lunch the other day, Brianne waited on us and was very sweet. The calzones rock! Great vibes and love the bar. Will be back and looking forward to the light rail bringing more foot traffic down there."}
{"text":"Went there about 3 pm, restaurant empty except for two other people, so I got really fast service. Ordered a slice of cheese pizza left over from lunch, it was still really good. Nice crust and the right amount of cheese. But the real star was the bruschetta. That I would have again in a heartbeat. This isn't your bowl of chopped tomato stuff with a side of toast you dish up yourself. 
No, Queens' bruschetta comes beautifully laid out on a fancy plate, topped with chopped fresh basil and drizzled with excellent sweet and tangy balsamic. The tomatoes are fresh and juicy. And the little toasts are crispy enough to hold up under the juice but not so hard you hurt your mouth biting into one. For the price, way more gourmet than I was expecting. Simple, done well, with really fresh and good tasting ingredients."}
{"text":"Good place.. the decor is nice old building and they accent its charm in the decor. food was delish kids had pizza wife and I had sand witches. not just another pizza joint is what I enjoyed about it."}
{"text":"This place used to be amazing. They totally lost all of their character & charm with relocating...way to be like every other sports bar/pizzeria... service sucked, slice size is about half what it used to be but more expensive. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Sunday night in Mesa, where to go for good pizza that was fairly close to our hotel (Marriott)?  Queens it was and we are happy we did.  We now live in a city known for its cheesesteaks but the pizza in Philly is dang good, too.  This ranked right up there with anything we've had there.

We ordered the Supreme and it was delicious.  It was delivered to our table piping hot and aromatic.  The sausage has a delightful sweetness to it and the red peppers are wonderfully fresh.  The other ingredients were tasty as well but those two really stood out.  We had plenty left over for lunch tomorrow.

The service was timely and professional...which is not to say stiff but the right amount of personality and fun.

I will admit to being a whisker concerned about cleanliness judging by the waiter, cashier all around worker dude apron (hint David, order one in brown or black) but Our table was clean, the floor was fine, counter spotless and as the kitchen is not walled off it is easy to see it is clean as well.  We did not use the restrooms so can not comment.  Deducting a star for a well worn apron would be ridiculous.  It was a five star evening for us."}
{"text":"They really need more wait staff and some signage that tells you what the service process is. Seat yourself, order at bar or order with waitress......tried to eat here and could get no service. Can't comment on food.....lame really."}
{"text":"Great place and thurs poetry rocks"}
{"text":"Yes, five stars. First, vegan options. Love that flexibility! Second, and just opposite of a lot of reviews on here, service was incredible. The bartender was attentive and genuinely kind. Third, food was excellent. So tasty. I'd go back in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, excellent location in downtown Mesa."}
{"text":"45 minutes for a slice of cheese. 
Thank you for allowing us to meet firemen from truck 201 today during a the Kidtastic event. However...this place was poorly staffed, having 2 waiters for 100s of moms and kids excited to eat pizza and meet firmen and climb in their truck. We sat down at 11:04 after meeting the firemen and saw the brand new waiter (2 days OTJ) 15 minutes later. I ordered a slice of cheese and a coke for $3.49. At 11:47 still no slice (actually it was sitting on the counter behind the bar where I could see it, no one was available to deliver it). Needless to say we took it to go and left because toddlers don't sit for that long. The pizza was cold and very average. 
Please plan better for an event with small children. I heard the staff complaining (as I had to go up to the bar to pay) about how people were complaining about delivery time to their tables. This place is not worth the wait."}
{"text":"I gave Queens 5 stars because I had the best service from Brianna. She was friendly and attentive. She knew her menu and gave excellent recommendations. I will definately go back and refer my friends. Thank you Brianna for an enjoyable experience"}
{"text":"Thank you to both managers on duty tonight. Both the guy and girl are stand up individuals. My kids and I say thank you for everything. We will be back!!!! Thanks for soda's !!!!!!! We will be pack for PIZZA!!!!
To the owner: great people keep us coming back."}
{"text":"This is one of those places where the food is better if you dine in. They make some of the best thin crust pizza! It's cooked to perfection. Just enough crunch without being dry or burnt which is why I like to dine in and get it fresh. It's fairly priced (including those adult beverages). Make it a point to stop in!!!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches at Queens are amazing. Aside from that, I've only had their pizza by the slice, which is a bit heatlamp/cafeteria-y; I've definitely had worse. I'd imagine their pizza is much better freshly baked. Service is very fast and friendly."}
{"text":"They did a full remodel. Place is excellent, with a full bar including a few micro brews on tap. I love their calzones. DÃ©cor is very nice."}
{"text":"We decided to try out this place downtown Mesa, food took awhile to get, we had to part of it to go. The services was good..... Until the next day when I noticed the tip adjustment was $6 more then what I left on the credit card. Food was real good, just pay cash."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly service, cool space.  Nice place for a good meal in downtown Mesa."}
{"text":"Wow!!! Everything was amazing.  The food was affordable and tasty!  We had pizza, chicken fingers, wings and salad.  Nothing disappointed. There are classic games for the kids to play.  Service with a smile.  They also display some art for sale that adds to the atmosphere.  If I lived here I would be a regular.  If you are in Mesa stop by!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, great customer service. This place is bomb and it's in a chill location. Hit it up."}
{"text":"Queens pizzeria I tried while I was visiting in Mesa, AZ for work. I was looking for a place close to the hotel Queen is in downtown Mesa. I liked the hip style of the restaurant, the open garage style entrance was interesting and inviting. Tried the Garlic Knots for an appetizer they were yummy like a pretzel breadstick. I had a veggie style pizza instead of red sauce it was an olive oil base. I liked the change up on the sauce, the pizza had basil, tomatoes and mozzarella cheese. The service was a bit slow and it took long for our pizza to be done. Overall, this was a good place to eat and hang out, but it was not something that I would look forward to going to."}
{"text":"Just had the Philly Cheeseteak sandwich and it was huge!  I decided to eat only half for lunch and save the rest for dinner, but that resolve didn't last long.  The bread was heavenly and the combined flavors were delicious.  Glad to have another lunch option downtown."}
{"text":"Stopped in here while getting my car repaired. The building has a great atmosphere with brick walls and art hanging. I ordered a calzone and I was blown away. So fresh and cheesy. I have been back 3 times in 2 weeks and brought friends. We all agree this is the best pizzeria around, forget Tessios or any chain. Get yourself down to Queens!"}
{"text":"This food is delicious! The people are absolutely great! The place is clean! What more could a girl ask for? My boyfriend and I have been here twice, both times were very busy, so in the chaos there was a wait to be served, and have orders taken, but neither of us mind, chaos happens. I believe if a place is busy, it's busy for a reason. Totally worth any wait. We had the lasagna pizza, which is absolutely delightful, I would recommend it to anyone. Anyways, most people are willing to wait 45 minutes at olive garden, so why not wait here and get fresh made pizza you can only get in downtown mesa? I say do it! Good food, sweet people, a great experience."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a cheese steak and some fries with the toddler. Service was ok. Cheese steak was good but slightly on the bland side. The fries were really good. They had crayons and coloring books for the lil guy. There was an excessive heat warning today so it would have been nice if it was a little cooler inside...kind of on the warm side. We've been here before and we'll be back."}
{"text":"My family and I have visited here multiple times and each time a different bad experience. My hope for this review is to hopefully encourage Management to make a few changes. I also want to stress that I am all about home grown businesses and LOVE to support them. 

Here are my experiences:
1. Out of dough at 6pm! We have visited on a weekday as well as a weekend and 3 times they have ran out of dough around 6pm. The crazy part is it wasn't busy. 
2. Raw dough pizza. Every time we visit one of us has to have our pizza sent back to be extra cooked due to it being under cooked. 
3. Lack of staff knowing menu. This sounds strange but we have came and ordered items on the menu that the staff there did not know how to make. I am discouraged to order anything but pizza because of it.
4. Cleanliness. Everytime we visit we have to ask for our table to be cleaned.

I have given Queens multiple chances and unfortunately I think I am going to have to pass on visiting for awhile."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered a slice of pepperoni pizza each and then split a chicken parmigiana sandwich. Both were very tasty! The sandwich bread was nice and crispy and the chicken was moist. The pizza crust was not too thick and cooked just right.
We will return :-) The only reason I did not give 5 stars was it took so long to get our food."}
{"text":"Was good,did dinner after Xmas stuff. Tables not bused quick. But staff nice, food good"}
{"text":"We love the Lonely Jack pizza, bruschetta, and bacon and chicken ranch sandwich. Happy hour is a good deal. We will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. As a New Yorker, the pizza was pretty decent and the chicken cutlet was tasty. Waitress was busy but vert attentive. Def will stop by if I am in the area and need some food."}
{"text":"I've been here 4 or 5 times now. Every time, the bruschetta is off the hook. I mean it's really good and you gotta try it. I also really enjoy the straight flush sandwich and the ace of spades. The meat is primo, too, but really my favorite part of the food are the fresh made breads.  They are exceptionally good! It's hard to go wrong with any of the appetizers here actually. And did I mention that there is craft beer in tap? Happy hour EVERY DAY 4-7. Loving it! Queens is a good place to get some 'za, watch the game, have a couple brews, and hang out, or take the family out, or go on a date here. Its all purpose ambience is pretty cool.  The service has always been attentive and friendly too."}
{"text":"Downtown Mesa has some hidden gems tucked away on Main St., and this pizzeria place is one.

The place itself is ran by friendly people, which is great for both families or a simple \"pick-me up\". The vintage arcade games like Drive'm & PacMan, as well as the super ball quarter machines add a unique flavor to the decor. As someone mentioned you may find a table, or the counter which is not very clean. In my opinion it's not that dirty, and definitely an eatable establishment.

The food is great. We tried the cheese and sausage pizza. The pizza is thin crust, with a traditional \"tomato\" taste to it, which gives it a homemade kind of flavor. The crust is awesome by the way.

Support your local businesses. This one is well worth it since the pizza is unique, and tasty."}
{"text":"There was a slight breeze and the green glow of the street light that performed it's lightly duty and kept us safe from the few cars that roamed the downtown streets. We walked past a young man shoveling the remains of the front window of the old Evermore Nevermore building into a wastebasket. We asked the caretaker if they were expanding into the adjacent building and if they were going to keep the mural that adorned the wall, he said yes they were expanding and didn't know about the mural as he shoveled the last of the earthly remains of the venerable Evermore Nevermore away to their final grave. 

We walked in through the door and soaked in the brightly colored decor, the smell of fresh dough being baked to a thin perfection that middle aged soccer mom's can only dream of. 

The staff greeted us exactly like the regulars that we are not. This ensures our continued visits to the brick walled abode of pizza goodness. 

The pizza was cheap, but tasted like a million bucks."}
{"text":"We visited here prior to a concert event at the Mesa theater and made a point of patronizing a locally owned \"non-chain\" establishment.  That was a mistake.  We ordered the bruschetta which was tantamount to a pile of onions on white bread.  The other dish we ordered was a \"loaded chicken salad\" -- not quite sure what it was loaded with?  The portion itself was smaller than something you'd get at a Wendy's drive thru.  What little chicken there was, was room-temperature and tasteless.  If I had to guess, it came straight out of a Costco tin can and into a microwave for 11 seconds.

And finally the worst of all... (which made 2 stars fall to 0, but I had to select 1)

Beware if you sit at the bar as you might not know what kind of disgusting germs you might pick up.  Would you like some hairy stink butt and balls with your meal?  At the bar was a drunk man (I'm assuming a local) who LITERALLY was sitting on the chair with his pants HALF-OFF.  (His bulky shirt partially covered the transgression, but not entirely.)  In other words, he was sitting on the bar chair with his bare a** and balls against the cushion.  Wow, what a glorious sight to see as your food is being delivered to you!!  Doesn't the thought of if it just make your mouth water? 

Oddly, the management either didn't notice, or didn't care to notice.  

Sorry, but after managing my gag reflex thinking about what I might be sitting on, we grabbed the check and GTFO."}
{"text":"Located in lovely downtown Mesa. This is one of the small businesses that is surviving (so far) downtown despite Mesa city governments' ineptitude and 19th century disposition. I have only had the pizza (Queen 'o' Clubs) and the brownies so far but both were very tasties and inspired a binge that might well have won a nod from a bulimic (maybe only if they were able to see me purge when I got home). With solicitous and snappy service to top-off the superfluous dine-in adventure the only thing that may be lacking is a nice beer and wine selection.

time to go back."}
{"text":"Me and the wife dopped in after noticing this place from the street, The scent emenating fron the joint was good, and we got in line. That's when the local color showed up.

We told this Tatooine-looking jag off to go ahead of us, to which he responded \"Don't tell me what to do\". He then stormed out to his moped. We chalked that up to \"he has issues\" and then ordered some vegetarian option whose proper name escapes me. We sat and watched cash cab and waited for our pie.

And waited. Then waited some more. While we were waiting, the five people working in the kitchen seemed to not be cooking so much. In fact, we watied 40 minutes for our pie. A pie which featured fresh basil, a Brazilian Boblsed Team style crust (weak and cannot hold a turn) and a \"free ice cream\" because it took so long.

A word of advice to Queen's Bakery. You may be the best pizza in Mesa, Arizona. That means crap outside of Mesa, Arizona. I have had better and have not had to wait 2/3 of an hour for a 12 inch pie. Your crust is weak, service weaker, and overall experience lacking. The motto for this place should be \"Less talk, more cooking.\" There was precious little of the latter to be seen."}
{"text":"Good pizza, friendly staff. I want to go back and try more from their menu."}
{"text":"Sorry folks. I stopped by for 2 slices of pizza. It was reheated to the point of dried out and burnt. Really bad."}
{"text":"While in town to watch some spring training baseball, we found this neat Pizza place right down the street from our Motel. We ordered a pepperoni pizza. To our surprise it was really good. The place had a really nice atmosphere. Plenty of TV's to watch sports and a nice selection of drinks. Our server was Sarah and she had a smile on her face every time she came to our table. I will definitely go back next visit to Mesa."}
{"text":"Go on Saturday! They have comedy night and it's super fun! They have amazing pizza &a wings! I got the lonely jack pizza & honey hot wings! I can't wait to come back and try their other foods!"}
{"text":"WOW!!!! This was not what I expected from a pizza joint! My husband and I took our 3 children to the Spark festival and after reviewing the food choices there we decided to take a walk. We found our way to Queens and decided that pizza was all the kids wanted. We ordered a Large Pepperoni that was wonderful. I am not a Pizza fan so my husband and I split the most amazing Spinach and Ricotta calzone and order of bruschetta. It was so flavorful I thought I was at a fine restaurant.   The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. The place can be busy so seating may be hard on a event night but trust me you will enjoy the food!!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome thin crust pizza. Their seasonings are very flavorful and the pepperoni is nice and spicy! The Olympics were going on and they happily changed the channel for us to catch some Olympic swimming. Everyone was so nice and welcoming."}
{"text":"To start, or server was great, she was attentive and set expectations. Those expectations being that the kitchen was full of new people and taking a long time.

One the food got there it was pretty good. The comedy event they were hosting was really bad though."}
{"text":"Great food!  Great service.  Try the pastrami.  Only a half....its big.  Perfectly located on Main Street and walking distance to lots of downtown attractions.  Pizza is always a good choice here."}
{"text":"Great little spot in downtown Mesa. Good East coast style pizza and their wind were really good. Try the prickly pear BBQ wings. Great beer list too. The bartender was really cool as well."}
{"text":"Understaffed. My husband bussed and wiped the table before we sat down, and got the pop refills for our table. The waitress didn't write down the orders for our table and consequently our pizza was not prepared as ordered. The bathrooms were disgusting. The floors were filthy. Paper towel littered the floor. There was so little soap that you had to take the lid off and shake it and even still got barely enough. My water glass was empty and the waitress didn't notice which isn't even her fault because she was only one of three servers on a night when there was an event in downtown mesa. The only accolade I have is that I love their queen of Spades pizza."}
{"text":"Went here October 2014. This place has good pizza and wings, but the wait staff can't handle a good sized crowd. Waited for 10 minutes and asked to have a dirty table cleaned up, waited another 5-10 minutes and nothing. You might get prompt service from the token greased if you're a cute girl, otherwise steer clear unless it's dead. Sad, I had such high hopes for this place. More wait staff, signage saying seat yourself or hire a hostess maybe?"}
{"text":"We arrived about 9pm here and the bar seats were all filled up on a Wednesday night so we grabbed a table.  There was plenty of open seats available at tables. We waited for about 10 minutes, still no server had approached us. So we went to the bar and asked if we could be waited on, still waited about another 10 minutes, before asking a third time if we could have someone  help us. A lady finally came over to say sorry  she is new, only 4th day working, and they were shirt handed. We placed our drink odder and she made a funny joke that we better place out food order because she might not be back for an hour! We ordered a pizza, it arrived pretty quick. She set it on the table quick and left. We had to grab her quick to ask for napkins as there were none at the table. As far as the pizza goes, I liked the sausage  that they used.  The pizza was a bit greasy, it would roll down my fingers as I ate. Overall, I wasn't pleased with the food or the service."}
{"text":"Holy hipster batman! I can't believe that downtown Mesa now is filled with hipsters! That is a huge step up from drug addicts roaming the streets. This place was filled with new vibe of hipster in the heart of downtown Mesa. At first I was unsure of this pizza place. But after eating the food, I can understand why nearly every seat in the house was taken. The food is great! The portions are large and the people are pretty nice. We got a calzone and a salad. It was hands down the best calzone I have ever had. Give these guys a try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Yes-- really digging the art that's hung there-- such a cool little place!"}
{"text":"It was good and the garlic cheese knots are super, they were out of wings so we will need to go back."}
{"text":"OK! So we show up at 9:15 on a Sunday night the sign says open and the hours on the front door says they close at 10p there's 9 people in our party. As soon as we walk in the guy at the counter rudely tells us they're closed after we told him the sign says they close at 10 he insists they now close at 9 starting today! WTF?! We walk out and try to find the closest pizzeria! As we are yelping 3 people walk in and are served! We haven't even eaten here and we already made up our minds we won't be coming back! We felt like we were discriminated against because of either our race (being we were all black and Latino) or our size in party, either way we will never return! We unfortunately can't give a zero star!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza joint!! I stopped in for a quick slice and ended up getting a personal size pineapple and ham pizza - delicious! The decor in the restaurant has an urban feel to it with a checkered floor and some really cool art pieces...nice relaxed atmosphere.  Everybody who worked in the place was super friendly.    

I'm a bit of a pizza fanatic and make it a point to try out the pizza in every country or state I visit - I was definitely impressed with theirs. It reminded me of true New York pizza; thin crust, just the right amount of sauce and cheese, yummy!"}
{"text":"Found this spot today  while walking around main street with the family. Ordered mild hot wings, a pie of pizza, an order of garlic cheese bread and a Caesar salad. No complaints. Salad was awesome and they upgraded it to a bigger one because they forgot to make it. They gave us extra wings, needless to say we took food home and my hubby and kids were super happy and full. Very friendly staff and great prices. If you like thin crust pizza this is a good spot, reminds of me of a New York City pizzeria."}
{"text":"I am always weary of new pizza places but i really enjoyed Queens! We got our pizzas to go, one pizza was just a pepperoni, and the other was along the lines of an everything pizza; our group like the everything pizza the most. The slices there are really big kinda different then what you get from the normal pizza chains. The pizza was great, my friends and I all said that we would come back!"}
{"text":"Overall disappointment. Can't recommend it. Gave it two stars because the atmosphere was upscale and pleasant, and the staff was very nice. The kitchen however fell far short of the expectations set by the atmosphere.

The pizza may be fine but what I ordered was not good. Perhaps that's because I didn't order pizza, in the pizza place. My own fault. I had my taste buds set on an eggplant parmesan sandwich, but they were all out. So I punted and ordered the Philly cheesesteak, sans the cheese. I also ordered a side of fries. The cheesesteak was mediocre, and they had no mustard. They did have a spicy mustard like concoction, but didn't work with the sandwich. The fries were a complete disaster. They were retired and oily. 

In summary, the $15 tab was well below what I would've expected from a subway or even a Wendy's at half the price. Perhaps I caught them on a day when the kitchen staff was also tired."}
{"text":"I had already heard good things about this place and was excited to try it. When I walked into the place it had an old school tone which I liked. The lady at the counter helped me right away so there was no waiting which was good. Not only that, but every time I walked near the register a new person would ask if I needed help. That's a great staff right there. I ordered for take out so I still had to drive home before trying it and it made me crazy. The food smelled so good. The crust was perfectly golden and crisp and it had the perfect amount of toppings. This is by far the best pizza place I have come across since moving out here. I'll be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Dave, the owner, is an awesome guy to talk to.  I work at a computer shop down the way and I have gotten to know him and his staff well.  They are a great bunch of folks with some damn good food!  Thin crust pizza is something that I have missed since being out in AZ from NJ.  This pizza is something to write home about!"}
{"text":"I went to this pizza joint a couple of years ago and it was really good. Great service and pizza. I took my family here today and it was a really bad experience. Such a bummer. We came in, no one greeted us. We didn't know where to sit, if was self seating or what. Then someone finally acknowledged us. It took about 10 minutes (we timed it) for someone to take our order. Ridiculous.  We asked for 3 of the pizza deals, 2 slices and a drink for 5.99, when we got our pizza (after waiting forever) there was only one slice. We asked for our other slice and I heard our waitress ask the kitchen for it. 10 minutes later, no pizza but a \"it will be just a minute\". 5 minutes later she came back and said that the kitchen didn't put in the pizza and would we like pepperoni instead of cheese. Um, no we wanted cheese.  I told her to just forget it. She didn't refill our drinks either. I also noticed that several other tables were sending food back for incorrect orders. It was just a mess. The pizza was pretty good though, hence the 2 stars instead of 1. One other thing, we ordered garlic bread and I saw it sit up in the window for at least 5 minutes before we got it AFTER our pizza. I think this could be a great place of they got the kitchen and customer service together. In our waitress defense she was the one to finally notice that we weren't served in the beginning after the male server said he would be with us and never came. She was trying and I think it was more an issue of the kitchen."}
{"text":"On the basis of being the 3rd highest rated Mesa restaurant, my girlfriend and I visited here today.  Walking in from the bakery entrance, the surroundings blow you away as soon as you get to the dining area.  Brick walls, really high ceilings probably around 35-40ft, windows in the ceiling bring in tons of natural light, vintage movie posters adorn the walls as well as local art.  For such a large building I was surprised how chilly it was, and for AZ in the summer, thats definitely a good thing.  There are some vintage arcade machines as well, and a pile of comic books and magazzines for customer perusal.  

On the basis of a prior reviewer, we went with the 16'' white pizza $16.99, which here constitutes olive oil, basil, mozzarella, mushrooms, and tomatoes.  The toppings came together well in a fairly thin pizza, with an addicting savoriness for many of the bites towards the center.  Considering olive oil was a huge component, I didn't think it was too greasy for what it was... however,  I wasn't too thrilled with the crust either, with some uncooked flour markings on the outside, and a general lack of doughy goodness.   

We were pretty stuffed but managed to find room for cannoli.  This was a nicely light version, with just the right amount of sweetness to be refreshing but not cloying.  The shell was decent, and for $2.95 its in line with cannolis elsewhere.

Overall I enjoyed my pizza but feel that there are a large number that are superior, even across the street at Cucina Di Vita.  With that said, I'll definitely be back due to the atmosphere and the truly welcoming attitude of the staff."}
{"text":"This is the worst pizza place in all of AZ. After 70 minutes of waiting in a nearly empty restaurant and listening to the manager tell me how screwed up their new system was, they then come out to tell us that they don't have cheese pizza!!! Only reason we were sitting there as our 10 yr old was starving.  \" We have new people working here\"  doesn't make up for the fact that you wasted 70 minutes of my time and that your waitress could have told us when we sat down. We also ordered wings..... never showed up but were told they were on their way.  70 minutes is enough to be patient ... Were you killing the chicken first? Only 1 other table of people in there. You deserve to be cooking French bread pizza in your own kitchen only --- (not cheese though)..."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time at Queens and it was a great experience! The food was tasty and the cute waitress with the long silver hair provided fantastic service. I'll be back real soon!"}
{"text":"I have been here with Friends. Night time, afternoon, Sunday, Saturday and Friday. Service has been good. Other than one Saturday afternoon about 3PM. Walked in was greeted a in a few minute and told to take any table. All the tables were dirty other than one large on that seated about six. It was only going to me and one friend that I was meeting. BTW there were one two tables with guest sited, not busy at all. I went to the bar and ordered a soda and sat outside in June, kind of hot. The friend came and he sat down. It took several minutes for anyone to come to the table. She said she wasn't sure if we wanted anything because I had got the soda. During the time we waited you could see two of three of the employees in conversation. Food was slow to come. When she did come to the table because we waved her down she would refill one drink and not offered to fill the other.
The soda was close to $3.00 and I did complain about it, maybe this was the reason the service was poor.
The owner was not there. The times before when we receives good service, the owner was there.
I called the owner a few days before posting this review. I was told that they would check to see if see was finished up, when they came back on the phone I was told that she just left. I left a return phone and never received a call back. I want to give the owner an opportunity to address the issue, before posting. All it would have took to keep me happy and returning would be a return phone call.
I may not be as willing to go back."}
{"text":"Found this using Yelp today and I am so glad I did. 

Had lunch with a friend and Queen's was everything they advertised themselves to be.

Restaurant is clean and staff is friendly and informative. I really like the open floor plan and the brick walls. Artwork was nice, but the seating could be a little more comfortable. 

Ordered Bruschetta while I was waiting for my friend and it was great! Bread was just thick enough so that it did not overpower the toppings. Very fresh ingredients and the taste was some of the best I have had, very nice. 

After speaking to one of the owners we ordered a meatball pizza (Vegas?) and it came to our table piping hot. Crust makes a pizza and this crust was good, but not great. It was cooked correctly but it was a little floury for my taste. Sauce was spicy, not sweet which is what I like.  The meatballs were cut into smaller pieces and were spicy and good, not greasy or overdone. Overall a good but not great pizza. I will definitely come back !
Note: Very cool place to hang out and get some work done as well. We stayed for several hours after we had eaten. 
TIP: Park in back."}
{"text":"These dudes are homies. Best pizza in town and the chilliest vibes of all time."}
{"text":"Pizza and wings were awesome! Great atmosphere the server was very knowledgeable about the food .My family will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I arrived at 2:10 on Saturday afternoon and ordered a calzone.  The restaurant was half-full of customers and there were several servers.  At 3:05, I had paid my bill, but my lunch still had not arrived, so I ran back to work hungry."}
{"text":"The best kept secret in Mesa!  My whole family loved it and we will definitely be going back for more.  Kids had the best cheese pizza they've ever had, dad and I split a sausage and mushroom calzone and garlic knots.  Everything was delicious and we can't wait to go again.  Staff is amazing and really friendly as well."}
{"text":"we found this place while walking in downtown for a first Friday event. i immediately loved the decor (exposed brick, some art on the walls, a really warm feel to it) and was instantly hooked by the smell wafting out of the front door. 

the pizza itself is not the most outstanding thing in the world but it is pretty decent and i would love to go back and try the different pies. the sauce on the pie was pretty good, a little spicy with a tang at the end. toppings were fresh and delicious but i would have liked a little more crunch from the crust. 

a really cute place to hang out at if you're in downtown mesa.i like the way this area is shaping up and turning out to be a resident friendly situation."}
{"text":"The pizza and cheesy sticks are so amazing! It's located in the middle of downtown Mesa. I love the atmosphere here. You get a good size portions for reasonable prices. The server was friendly. Its clean, and good for families or if your on a date. I would definitely recommend to try it out. You'll be leaving here with a full tummy and a smile."}
{"text":"Pretty fun casual place. I came on a Saturday night and they have free standup comedy for a couple of hours every Saturday evening for your entertainment. The last time I came they had the most delicious pizza. They have a gluten free option and a dairy free option too."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and it is hit or miss. The slice for lunch is good if the pizza was just made. I've had it when it wasn't and they don't bother to hear it up. I really like their caprese salad but when my friend ordered it on another visit it had little crumbles of mozzarella instead of the round slices I had the first time. On another visit it took forever to be waited on and to get our food. When my meatball sandwich finally arrived it was cold same with my friends meals. There were two men that arrived before us. One of them never received his order. His friend had already eaten and they were apologizing and offered to box his up to go. I hope they didn't charge him. I wouldn't recommend this place until they get their stuff together."}
{"text":"I grew up and pizza parlors my family owned several upstate New York. What a great pie great experience great service absolutely nothing bad to say about this place delicious well price great service you like pizza Euro to yourself to visit try one of their boards. You'll have to go there to figure out what it is"}
{"text":"Suckered into shopping for antiques with some out-of-town visitors, I found myself in Downtown Mesa on a Saturday afternoon. After about an hour, my friends were pretty over antiques (checks out); one of them had a real hankering for a calzone, so our party of 6 headed over to Queens at around 2pm. We got seated immediately, as there were only a couple other tables in the restaurant, and waters delivered quickly. 

Our waitress was very nice, but shockingly flustered considering there were 3 parties in there. She took our orders with minimal difficulty, and then we didn't see her again for 40 minutes--no exaggeration, between the time we ordered and the time we got our food was 40 minutes. We had a dozen wings, an order of garlic knots, and one calzone. 40 minutes. 2 other tables in the restaurant. Seriously?? We weren't in a rush, so it wasn't a huge deal, but sure was annoying.

I finally got my wings, a half order of the prickly pear bbq, and they looked sad and sparse on the giant plate all by their 6 little selves. I feel like there's a lot of lee way with wings, and it's pretty hard to make them inedible, but these were pretty drastically overcooked. None were burnt, but 2/6 were so overcooked that they were exceptionally dry, even smothered in sauce. It was a decent bbq sauce, a little sweeter than average, but not at all prickly pear-y. 

My friends' garlic knots looked good, but apparently were meh. They seemed deep friend, which was interesting, but basically not garlicky at all inside. There was a ton of just chunks of garlic thrown on top, but were reportedly overall underwhelming. 

It seems very unlikely that we'll ever be back; we might've considered it had the food been good after the disastrously long wait, but it just wasn't worth it. Speaking of worth... Worth Takeaway is just down the street and knocks it out of the park every single time; opt for that instead if possible."}
{"text":"Tried to go last night at 7 and they were closed. I don't know what happened but there were seven of us and we had to scramble to find another place to eat in a hurry."}
{"text":"Yummy. The bruscetta is wonderful. Freshly baked breads compliment the sandwiches. Simply yummy"}
{"text":"My past two experiences at Queens have been disappointing. I love the atmosphere and the service is ok. However I feel like the food quality has suffered perhaps as a result of the ownership change. The calzone I had was large, but flavorless. The pizza seemed unbalanced as well, too much seasoning, slightly undercooked. There are better choices."}
{"text":"Yes this place is deserving of all 5 stars!!!  The service is great, very cute lil spot, and the Pizza is incredible!  That is saying a lot considering I shared a vegan pizza with my GF.  I am definitely an omnivore however I would definitely eat it again and I will be back to try other things.  They even have Stromboli!!!  What????  I miss that from back east and it's hard to find here in the desert.  NY style pizza and selections and I'm sold!  Great menu, great prices, cute decor, mom and pop spot, and super friendly staff!!!  What more could you want?  Go check it out and support local business!!!  You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Stopped in Mesa to visit a few antique shops downtown& decided we needed a bite of lunch.  Excellent choice - definitely worth the drive - we enjoyed the Stromboli & Chicken Bacon Ranch sandwich!  Both huge portions & fantastic!  Beer at the perfect temperature with fantastic customer service!  Definitely worth a repeat visit when in town!"}
{"text":"The food is standard fare, nothing amazing, but not disgusting either. But, I give them four stars because of two reasons. First, the employees are extremely friendly and real. I forgot his name now, but the bald guy with tattoos was so nice. He loved my Great Dane who he said made his day better since he was having a stressful day at work.

So he gave me and my boys a nice discount. I so appreciated that because I had to drive a long way to get there, so it really helped balance out the expense. I noticed the beautiful exposed brick of the historic downtown Mea building too, and it captured my heart and made me wish I lived out there since everything in north east Phoenix is pretty \"big box\" corporate owned generic strip mall land.

I would definitely go back again because even though it took literally over an hour for our food, I am a patient person and was just hanging out with my dog, friends and family."}
{"text":"Food was ok-ish, but service has been awful 3 times! Each visit was during a different event downtown, and it was as though the staff in this place were caught unaware. Newsflash, events bring people, people are good for business, be ready! I can understand busy, but I can't be ok with snippy, rude, and unapologetic. Won't be back for a fourth round of that."}
{"text":"This place grew on me while I was there which was an improvement.  It's a nice place overall, done well with some style and color.  Right on the main drag, good parking in back, good prices.

The first issue was a TV that was really loud playing some kind of (high school?) musical.  Too loud for a mostly empty restaurant.  I ordered 2 slices and the chicken fingers since they said they accept the YELP coupon and I needed to get to $10.  The two slices came in a couple of minutes but it was obvious they were just sitting under hot lamps.  You have to put that puppy in an over for a couple of minutes.  Soft overall and semi-warm which is hard to really enjoy.

A short while later the chicken fingers arrived.  I'm not a huge fan but these were really, really nice.  Kind of melted in your mouth but still had crunch on the outside.  While I was eating the TV had been turned down and the waitress stopped by and we chatted for a minute.  Nice touch to the service.  

By the end of the meal I started to like the place more.  I might give it another shot for take-out and see how it tastes out of the oven."}
{"text":"Queens did not get a five star review from me bc it's simply not s 5 star experience, however the staff and especially bartenders always give me 5 star treatment. The last two times I have been in, I've received half frozen salads and they were out of tiramisu BUT the pizza is really really good and tastes homemade. That's what it's all about, the beers are awesomely selected and always taste fresh. The last couple times I have been in I notice that the poor bartenders have had to deal with the most pretentious assholes Mesa has to offer. One guy yelled at the server bc he didn't know why the sausage wasn't crumbled, it was sliced and proceeded to tip horribly. The server handled it like a saint. The second time, this woman, got served a simple wine at the bar and had the bartender poor it out bc she didn't let the wine \"breathe\", it's a freaking house wine at a pizza joint asshole?! And she offered her a glass after it had \"breathed\" but the lady couldn't wait any longer bc she had to go to her sons violin recital. (A different server this time), killed that B with kindness. I'm thoroughly impressed and will always be back to eat frozen salad and poor \"well\" selected alcohol for my happy hour just to tip these kids and support em because their service is awesome. The owners should acknowledge them"}
{"text":"This was fun . Felt like I was back in New York , Almost yeld for A Taxi , Then realized it was still mesa .I liked it alot .Very clean and organized .Best of luck in the new year ."}
{"text":"It's in the middle as for rating because they have some good food, some not. The pizza not my fav, the sandwiches are ok but pricey. The salad not worth it.  The drinks great. The service great. I'd go back and drink but not sure the pizza should be what they outside themselves on"}
{"text":"Only giving four stars as I have never been to the actual location, only eaten takeout pizza that a friend picked up. But the pizza was excellent! We got the ham, pineapple and jalapeno thin crust pizza. This has to be the best pizza in Mesa!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. The staff was standing around, the pizza by the slice was limited to two choices that looks to have been sitting for a while and wasn't very good.  And no one seemed to really care."}
{"text":"Went here recently with a friend and was satisfied 100% the garlic knots and wings are fantastic! Service is a little slow but nothing that'll hold me back from going again and again."}
{"text":"We were in the Downtown Mesa area and decided to try Queens Pizza. My husband and I are big pizza people, so we love trying out new places.

The atmosphere is fun and laid-back. We had our 2 toddlers and didn't feel out of place when there were a little loud or when they were running around. The art and decor is really fun, and there are a few arcade games. 

The food was alright. We ordered one of their specialty pizza's (the lasagna pizza) which was suggested to us by the cashier, and wings (hot and honey bbq). The wings were ok, and the pizza was fine. We would probably go back if we were in the area again, or if we had the kids, but I can't see us going back just for the food."}
{"text":"Decent food, good pizza but they need to work on food timing cause its too long to wait for anything that needs to cook. We had 4 people ready to buy entrees but the wait for food was 30-40 mins IN THE RESTAURANT!! Needless to say they lost $ on food sales there. And the bathrooms are gross! They need to be cleaned Ana kept up with more, dirty floors and purse hook half the screws falling outta the door"}
{"text":"I plan on returning with friends because I like the food here and most other people will too.  When my group ordered a large pizza I expected the wait to be long, quality pizza isn't fast.  We did wait awhile for our pizza but we ordered garlic knots to keep us satisfied and the wait- time wasn't excessive.  Everything was super good and well worth waiting for.  The kitchen managed to get our order wrong but no one was upset because the food tasted perfect.  Our server was apologetic for the mixup and did everything right from a customer service standpoint (so we all got lucky and there was no real harm).  Give this place a try, I for one will be going back.  If order mixups aren't the norm. here I will have no problem giving this place 4 or even 5 stars."}
{"text":"Really good. Loved honey drizzle on the pizza. Nice to see a cool place  on Main Street in Mesa. Nice atmosphere  nice service"}
{"text":"Great local place. Staff is super friendly. Thin crust pizza is delicious. Sandwiches are amazing. The bread tastes freshly made. Very impressed and would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Still a horribly executed establishment. Staff is poorly trained, food is not enjoyable and atmosphere is geared more toward a bar than pizza"}
{"text":"The pizza here is good but the servers aren't very good. The restaurant is pretty small and the servers don't seem like they have very many tables each, yet they always seem like they're in a rush or are stressed out."}
{"text":"Great food and services. Top notch place that I would definitely recommend.  Wings and pizza were very yummy. A must try!!"}
{"text":"Been there for TWO days in a row. My daughter and I bought there special, so we each got one SLICE and a drink. The crust is soft and has a unique flavor. The sauce has an extra ummmph that I can't put my finger on. It's just sweet enough to make you want more than one slice ...:) Love the building and the openess of it all. We will be back again and again. :)"}
{"text":"Service was good until more people walked in. All wanting drinks before the show that we were going to as well and even though they knew there was a show you would've thought that they would have staffed for that. We went back between bands and the same thing. Again, there will always be slow service from time to time and that's why this is still a four star because before everyone walked in the service was great! Message to the owners! Staff one more server at least on nights where The Nile has a big show!"}
{"text":"Best white sauce on a pizza I've ever had! The crust was a little bland for my liking, reminded me of a frozen pizza you heat up in the microwave BUT strangely enough I would go back. A sign on the door said the restaurant was under new ownership so maybe they are still feeling it all out?"}
{"text":"I support local business!  The staff are A+.  Ambiance is bright and open with cool old brick walls, high ceilings and local art.  I ordered the Queen Sandwich (their take on a Caprese) and it was delicious.  The Pizza is offered in slices or by the pie.  Thin and large, they are great as long as the staff does not over heat them.  The BBQ Chicken Sandwich was not so good and they forgot my requested cheese.  Timing on food could use a bit of work.  My friend gets slices and I get a sub 5 minutes after their food.  It's just kinda a pet peeve of mine.  Bathrooms are clean, parking in back, free refills and I feel appreciated as a customer when I'm there.  I like it for lunch to people watch off of Main."}
{"text":"Need a delivery, 9 PM on Sunday and they said they're closed? Maybe update the hours on Yelp?
Looks fantastic though :-("}
{"text":"Even when I feel like something fell short (service wasn't super great or the food was a little over done (on the really packed out nights)) I always enjoy myself here!  The food really is delicious (*creative* vegetarian dishes are kind of scarce, this place has options, so that alone keeps me happy), the drinks are always spot on, and the staff are engaging and entertaining.  Even if I visit and feel that only two out of those three were met that night, I'm still smiling when I leave, and stoked to share with friends and colleagues.  I even had my birthday dinner there in May and they were super accommodating.

I love this place!

Plus it's just off the light rail so we can sober up and let our bellies settle on the ride to our car :)"}
{"text":"We went around 830pm and ordered some food to carry out. My husband and I both bought a drink at the bar. The one bartender was doing his best from what I could tell, with no other employees insight except an \"of the clock\" employee still in his uniform drinking at the bar. The off the clock employee kept stepping in to \"help\" despite loudly asking what the legal drinking limit was. He was clearly way over it. They bartender called  this other employee \"David\". This was entirely unprofessional. My husband and I waited 1 hour and 48 minutes for our food (a 12 inch pizza and an order of chicken tenders). When we got back home we realized what a mistake waiting had been. 3 small chicken tenders cost us nearly $7!? And the pizza (prosciutto arugula) was bland and mostly uncovered on the top (1/3 cheese and toppings, 2/3 bland burnt crust). You left one person on to man the whole place on a Saturday night? In downtown Mesa? The poor busy bartender! It's just irresponsible of the scheduler. Lost our business for absolute certain. 2 hours is too long to wait for terrible food."}
{"text":"Nothing overly special about this place.  The pizza is good, not great, and all of the items are standard fare.  The space is really clean and cute."}
{"text":"We are here accidentally... AZ bike week... looking for a decent margarita and a snack. Found a hideous Patron Maggie down the way at some nasty tavern... a sip on the lip... a whore out the door. 

Pulled into \"Queens Pizzeria\" and the Bartender informed us that she'd never poured an adult libation before. Oh? Well, you can't do worse than the hellhole we just came from. One shot of GREAT tequila... one shot of Grand Marnier... muddle lime and orange in a glass of ice and pour it straight up. Does that make sense? It's a margarita \"my way\" !!

Our novice bartendress \"Rhea\" commandeered a 5    for attitude, desire (for lack of a better word) and ability to handle both the bar and restaurant. 

On a critical side, we'd like to see a few more pizza combinations-- and since we lacked imagination tonight, we ordered a sandwich. The bread was toasted w Italian meats, toms, pepperoncinis. Love that they have the trilogy on each table: Parmesan, red pepper and Oregano!!!

We sat outside and enjoyed the atmosphere. Would we come again? Absolutely... we'd just order a pizza w more meat, veggies and... hubby said to mention that he votes for pineapple!!!"}
{"text":"Was turned away at another pizza place so we ended up here and it was really good. The garlic knots are so different from others. Crisp, but very good. The servers were very nice and always checking on us. I would tell others to go here for sure. Pizza is very good too."}
{"text":"I found myself in downtown Mesa because I wanted to peruse the Vinyl collection of a nearby establishment.

There aren't many dining options here, as of yet, in comparison to Scottsdale, Tempe, Chandler, and even Old Town Gilbert.

I was famished after scouring the classic Vinyl isles, and I found myself wandering through this quiet downtown. Perhaps, one day thing will pick up down here. For now, it is fairly devoid of the general populace.

Therefore, I wandered into this quaint little Pizzeria. They had a fair amount of people dining within. Which was surprising since there weren't a lot of people meandering about the streets.

I waited for a little bit before someone acknowledge that I had been seated, and not yet served. My server, Renee, was quite affable and definitely a card. I believe that I learned more about her in just a few minutes of interaction than I normally do with most people. 

They didn't have an extensive menu, so I went for the obvious. A small pepperoni pizza, and a half a dozen mild wings. Fairly simple, and nothing fancy. 

Not too long afterwards, the wings arrived first. They were quite good, but nothing too impressive. I mean, these are just buffalo wings, after all. Except for the different sauces, deep fried wings taste the same for the most part.

Then a few minutes later the pizza arrived. The crust was well done, and about as good as I had tasted from places like Grimaldi's. Overall, the pizza was good, but not great.

For a pizza place to crop up here, in the middle of a semi-deserted downtown on a Saturday night is a big plus for this area as a whole. For a long time, the only draw here was the Desert Eagle Brewing company. Now, there are even more alternatives for those that desire a change of venue."}
{"text":"I would not eat here again. The service was terrible. They were out of bread and other items that we wanted to order and the kitchen was backed up so much, that the manager could not even get me a salad. We were very disappointed."}
{"text":"Suuuuper slow service. Bruschetta was good, but it took 34 min. Yes I timed it. I looked at the time stamp from my bar receipt. ..disappointed.

Got a slice too even though it looked old. Asked the server how old and he said a couple hours but it tasted days old. QT has better pizza. And it took about 6 min to get a slice after I asked the waiter who was standing right at the thing with all of the slices in it..for real we were right there. 
 
It took 1 full hour for me by myself to get everything and go. And I ate everything in 5 min or less !  I hate writing bad reviews, but wow. Come on guys ! 

2 stars instead of 1 because the bruschetta was good."}
{"text":"This place keeps getting worse. The wife and I came in for lunch because they serve beers on tap that we love. Also we enjoy not only the pizza but their sandwiches.

We tried ordering one beer on tap and they were out. We tried to order another annd they were out. They were actually out of quite a few of beer on tap. So, I order a Corona.

We also ordered the Italian sandwich. We used to order a sandwich called the queen of hearts (I think) and it was great. Well, they longer serve that. So we go with their Italian sandwich. The damn sandwich was served with Texas toast instead of a roll. Wtf is with that? A Corona and a home like sandwich. I seriously could have stayed home and made this myself. I came for a great experience and boy did it suck. I'll wait until I hear that someone else takes over this joint before I come back."}
{"text":"I came here earlier this year and the service was amazing. However, things have changed dramatically. We waited a long time to get greeted, served drinks, and finally served food. The only thing saving my new rating is the fact that the food is still great."}
{"text":"Vegan Pizza is outstanding. Get it with extra Daiya Cheese and well done. They could have more beer options. The Strawberry draft beer rocks!  Workers very fun and attentive."}
{"text":"Came here because our friend wanted to see the weekly \"poetry slam\". I like that it's family owned and that they have really cheap specials like 2 slices and a 20 oz drink for $5.95. The downside was that they don't seem to have a lot of kitchen staff so it took awhile to get our food. They even forgot my friend's order and said they couldn't give a refund. Kudos to them for making her a special personal pan sized pizza and gave her a free brownie too =) Pizza was tasty, a little on the greasy side though. 

Poetry slam was cool, lots of interesting characters. I think I would come back here for fun since the downtown area is kind of cute. But it's kind of a far drive for me to get pizza. I got to be a judge at the poetry slam. I guess if you give any score less than a 9.0, even if you don't really like the performance, people in the audience will boo you as a judge. Oh well, if I went up there, I probably wouldn't get more than a 5, so who am I to judge art"}
{"text":"I have to say after a long day at a dive meet, this was a great place to go and unwind.  The pizzas slices were amazingly good.  The inside is a little divey or as my daughter put it rustic.  Still we really enjoyed the food.  The restroom was a little sketchy and the old linoleum tile floor looked like they have seen their last day.  But once again the pizza was excellent. I did have the some wings and they were very good as well."}
{"text":"I love this place- I was nervous when I noticed the menu changed but So far everything I've had has been excellent! Garlic knots and the lasagne pizza were to die for! Love the Saturday night stand- up show. The manager was super friendly and helpful to make sure my friends had a seat. Love he art and decor - looks like they've done some enhancements. Great place, atmosphere and food!"}
{"text":"This place absolutely sucks. I've come here now for lunch twice and wish I didnt. The first time I came here it took about 10 minutes before we were even greeted, tables were all dirty with plates, glasses and used utensils. Even after I left none of the tables had been cleared off. There were 2 sets of groups that came for lunch that got sick of waiting and left. I wish I would have done the same.

On my second trip now to queens and the co2 tank is out. The special that is so sought out for isn't even possible! They offered us water and lemonade as that is the only beverage that doesn't not require co2 yet my glass was completely dirty. I went up to the bar to replace my glass MYSELF since I was not about to wait and the SECOND glass was also dirty.

I will NEVER return to this place ever again. Save yourself and do the same!"}
{"text":"Ok but nothing to write home about .. I ordered to go ahead via the phone . There was construction blocking the Main Street and had to go around the back.  The place was empty and my food was ready to go ( I decided to add a cannoli on at the counter ) I figured it would be a quick grab but nearly 10 min later the cannoli was ready .  At this point I was ok with everything .  I get home and try a \"garlic knot \" and unfortunately they were not what I imagined .. They were merely dough from a can twisted to look like a knot or frozen ( like the tube stuff you buy \"crescent roll\") and they were barely cooked and pretty raw :(  We got a \"isabella \" pizza as we wanted a Margherita style and this is what they suggested .  The cheese was pretty simple and nothing amazing and the sauce was ok .  The crust had a lot of cornmeal on it and was very flat .   Needless to say it was ok and filled me up but we probably won't be coming back ."}
{"text":"Love, love this place. Staff, food, drinks, atmosphere! Highly recommend it. Just needs to be open a little later. Great place to unwind and would love to go after my late work nights. On the weekends till 11 or 12 would be ideal! Still love you guys, keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Tastes like cardboard frozen pizza. Expensive. Took 35 minutes to get one pizza. They were out of parmesan. Out of bread too."}
{"text":"There were four of us in our party, three of us ordered pizza and one ordered a philly sandwich. Pizza came out first and we had to wait several minutes for the sandwich. The food was good, but in the end, the service suffered. In fact, I was shocked at what our server told me. Get this:  our bill came and I noticed a discrepancy. I asked our server why our second glass of wine was more than our first glass. Our server said the first glass was on happy hour. I told our server that according to their website, happy hour goes to 7. Our server said , no it only goes to 6. I said ok and when the server left to cash us out, I pulled up their website . Sure enough, their website shows happy hour from 3-7, and costs for the wine was less than what we were charged. When our server returned, I brought it to his attention. I was not prepared for his response...this was it: \"I could take a couple of dollars out of the tip jar, if you want\" REALLY????? That was the best this guy could come up with. What a joke!! First and last time at that place."}
{"text":"Horrible service !!! Just awful!! They messed up my order three times. I left starving."}
{"text":"UPDATE 11-08-2015

No longer the Best Pizza in town. Too many misses than hits with the sausage and the sauce. The pizza is on Point when they don't cut corners on the toppings. Although that female named Ivy??
is a very hard worker and she is the ONLY employee who moves with a purpose AND she is probably the youngest employee there. Looks like who ever raised her did a good job!"}
{"text":"After our failed attempt to have lunch at Cucina di Vita, we went across the street to Queens.  Thankfully, this pizzeria actually has mozzarella on hand as well as slices, so we were able to eat right away.

The pizza was okay.  Big slices, good crust, but it had the \"been sitting too long\" factor as most slices do.  My husband thought it was great though, so I told him to write his own review.  I imagine their freshly made pies would be pretty darn good.  I also got a caesar salad.  Not a traditional caesar, but a good salad none-the-less.

The people working were really nice, and I might come back again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Bummer, ever since David left...service has really taken a dive. There is some employee in glasses who just decides to serve whomever he wants, it doesn't matter how long you've been sitting there. We left and won't be back...service is everything."}
{"text":"Food is probably one of the most unique. In a good way. Initially I thought they were NY style, but it seems that these guys created something new. 

The sauce and pepperoni were delicious. The crust left more to be desired. Although I would appreciate the price rating be put at $$, as they are a lot more expensive than I thought. 

$16 for a one topping 16\" pizza isn't bad, considering the great taste, but it does warrant another dollar sign."}
{"text":"So me and my boyfriend went here today to try it out. The food was decent but for two beers, a pizza, and 5 wings our bill was almost 50 dollars. We both thought the atmosphere was pretty cool but service left a lot to be desired. Both he and I are in the industry so I don't really blame the bartender server. She was notably busy and overwhelmed. She had a full bar and 8 tables with people still rolling through the door including a 7 top. What baffeled me is why she was left alone??!! No manager to lend a helping hand, no server on the floor to take tables. It was just all so hard to watch and I felt truly sorry watching her struggle. To make matters worse there was absoulutly nothing stocked or preped for her. She was litterly having to cut fruit for one drink at a time slowing her down even more. All in all I would go back but management needs to step up their game, schedule appropriately, and set their staff up for success. Clearly service is an issue from reading other reviews.  Why aren't they working to fix the issues?"}
{"text":"It's so great to have a pizzeria that serves pizzas with vegan cheese so close by! This is a fantastic place to order a pizza if you're vegan. The guy who took my order and made my pizza was very nice, helpful, and he even gave me a discount! I will definitely be returning here again."}
{"text":"This was a total yelp find. I was house sitting for my in-laws and wanted some pizza so after reading reviews on a few places I decided on Queens. 

First I put a pick up order in at 8 pm on a Saturday night and was told it would be ready in about 30 minutes which is not a bad wait. I parked in the rear of the restaurant and entered through the rear entrance which could of had better signage given the low light. Upon entering I was hit with the amazing smell of a quality pizzeria. The place was clean, kind of funky in the decor department and had a MS Pacman standup arcade game which I was immediately down to play but at last even though I was 10 minutes early they were taking my pizza out of the oven. I ordered a lonely jack minus the jalapeÃ±os and it looked delicious when they showed it to me. I got back to the house and found the pizza still hot after the 15 minute right . I had read reviews that raved about the crust and after the first bite I have to say the reviews were right the crust is amazing. It is thin with a slight crisp on the bottom ( I will order it a tad crispier next time) but with a good chew to it. It was complemented by fresh ingredients cooked to the right point. The pizza was very good and the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is due to the rear entrance situation which was low light and poor signage. Good pizza joint that if I lived near by would go into my rotation."}
{"text":"I'm happy we tried this place! We originally came to DT Mesa to try Desert Eagle Brewery but they didnt serve food until 5 so we wandered in here. The portions are enormous and well worth the price. We have so much food to take home with is. Beer selection is pretty decent and our bartender was very nice.
I hope this place picks up and becomes a part of DT Mesa"}
{"text":"Ordered over the phone and came to pick up for take out. When we got there we were greeted promptly. Paid for our food to realize that we were missing some food. Then had to sit for another 10 minutes while they made the rest of our food. When we were finally able to get everything, the fries were soggy, the philly cheesesteak that we had very clearly ordered with no veggies had veggies. There was barely any sauce on the meatball sub. The garlic knots and the chicken fingers were mediocre. Overall the staff was friendly, but not very \"into\" their job. And the food was not that amazing, very bland. Will most likely never go back."}
{"text":"Today, we order a large lasagna pizza and their amazing garlic cheese knots. Ufff if you have not had them you need to add thus to your order from here on out. NONETHELESS, i am writing a wonderful review towards this great pizza place. The reason for this is that they do not deliver but they do use this outsource company named \"GrubHub.\" We placed our order with them and it was unfortunate that their deliverman from Grubhub was rude, derogatory and demeaning. My family as well as myself were not pleased with them. GRUBHUB was also 1 hr 45 mins late with our food. 

Luckily, when we contacted Queens Pizza they were very apologetic about our situation. It was not their fault they also contacted grubhub due to the drivers fault. They waited for the driver for sometime. Once the driver was located he still proceeded to be rude. Again, we reached out to Queens and they were so helpful that they took it into their own hands to reach out to GRUBHUB. They also made sure that we had our money reimbursed. What was even more beautiful is that they made us a new order. They are personally delivering it to our door to ensure we recieve a warm meal. Wow, after all this bad experience they sincerely turned it all around. Needless to say it was not their fault. 

Now, we are able to enjoy this beautiful rainy sunday evening with my family. Of course, a nice scrumptious deliscious warm meal made by Queens Pizza. We wanted to say thank you and we appreciate what you have done for us. Not only is your food amazing but your customer service is OUTSTANDING. I will continue to brag about your business over and over without any hesitation. THANK YOU THANK YOU.... you went over an above with customer satisfaction. THANK YOU for having an amazing team in assisting us in these matters. Thank you yo your Manager for taking it into his own intuitive in driving the food out to us when your company doesnt deliver. 

I HOPE THAT ANYONE WHO READS THIS DECIDES TO COME ON IN AND TRY YOUR FOOD AS WELL AS MEET YOUR AMAZING STAFF.

BEYOND SATISFIED CUSTOMERS"}

{"text":"I went here last night during the Motorcycles on Main event that happens the first Friday of every month. Normally I like this place a lot but on these nights, be prepared to wait a bit. I don't think they have enough people working for them all the time to cover these nights like last night. But I won't penalize them for this since its once a month and wouldn't be fair to expect a business to maintain extra staff all the time based on one night.
But the food is good and consistent and they try their hardest to be friendly even when dealing with all the people on first Friday especially all the bikers.
Check em out, but make your first time at a different time then the first Friday evening of the month.

Update: I was telling some friends about this experience and it reminded me of something that caused me to change my review from 4 stars to 5.
Even with as busy as they were, the food presentation was very impressive. My wife ordered a full order (10) of honey hot wings. The wings came on a sushi style platter, long and not very wide, and they were nicely stacked on one end with the dipping sauce was at the other end. then the wings were drizzled in an opposite pattern with both the buffalo sauce and the honey sauce. I just thought that was going the extra mile to make the food look as good as it tastes."}
{"text":"Friendly service and great food!! Just finished the Mediterranean salad, pizza, wings and the kahlua cake was outstanding!! David surprised us with the cake for my dads birthday and made the whole visit extra special!!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying the food is still good and the service that Sarah gave us was perfect. The reason for the 2 star rating is the outrageous charge for pizza toppings. We ordered an 18 pizza half cheese and half bacon and pepperoni. We were charged 4.99 for each of these toppings. I find this high of a price for topping completely ridiculous. This will be the last time my family will ever go to Queen's. I feel complete ripped off."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I Love Queens Pizza.......when its on point! Having said that, it brings me around to my point. Queens Pizza has been so inconsistent lately that I am considering finding a new \"spot\". I am not the person that goes in 2 or 3 times a year, I come here weekly, or at least I did until recently! I am not sure what has been happening but the quality of some of the ingredients, namely the sausage on their pizza, has declined! I prefer the sausage crumbles that they season themselves, but they are constantly running out, so they will substitute an inferior product. Today I ordered a pizza and the sausage on it was the WORST I have ever gotten. We had to pick it all off to be able to eat the remainder. 

I have already learned my lesson about going there if there is anything going on in Downtown. The service is spotty at best. Management needs to designate certain employees for certain tasks. Tables would get cleaned faster and you would get your drinks faster if there isn't 3 or 4 people jockeying behind the bar. I won't even get started on the older angry waitress, but I try to avoid her at all costs.

Queens: you have the capacity to be a great spot, but the kinks are killing you! I understand that this is a small business, but you stay in business by getting repeat customers who give great word of mouth advertising. The pizza I got today, was not even worthy of calling it a \"chain restaurant\" pie! 
-Derek is an awesome guy, but when you are busy, he chats a little too much to stay productive. Maybe Travis should be the busy night guy. 
-Matt is a nice guy but its obvious that this is his first gig as a waiter. 
-Ivy deserves a raise! She is running, while trying to get people's orders in, drinks handled, and cleaning up.
Help me to help you! I want to keep coming back but I won't if I lose faith!"}
{"text":"I don't know... I was hoping for wings. But they said they were out of wings and a bunch of other food on the menu. My friends ordered the 2 garlic knots and they came out very burnt. At least they gave us a free order of garlic knots.

The pizza was expensive and tasted really bland. That's really disappointing for a $14 personal pan pizza. And when I showed my Yelp check in coupon for $2 off, they said they don't accept it. They did accept after some discussion and said it will be their \"one time courtesy\" toward me. They should really take that check-in offer.

Overall, bad food and bad service. I don't know what these other positive reviews are about but there are better pizza places with better pizza out there. And a full menu to boot."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for lunch midweek. It's a large open space with a few tables and a bar area.

The Ace-O-Spades sandwich was humongous and full of meatballs, sauce and cheese.  A really good sandwich and I took home half which was great warmed up the next day.

I'd like to come back and try their pizza sometime."}
{"text":"Fun place, local color and characters . Pizza is superlative. Definitely worth the drive and the parking hassle. This is not your chain pizza shop - real deal (pun intended)"}
{"text":"The kids and I were headed to the Mesa Arts Center for Ignite Phoenix 6, so we scoped around for a highly rated restaurant that was nearby.  So glad we decided on this place, the pizza was fantastic!  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is a great place if you love slow service and a dirty atmosphere. I don't know who hired the people who work here, but they themselves need to be fired. Staff refuses to clean tables, a gentleman came in 20 minutes after two other guys left the bar, pushed their dirty plates out of his way and had to ask the waitress to clean them up. This place smells musty and dirty. Pizza freakin sucks! Just re-headed slices. A 12 inch personal pizza will cost you 14 dollars. We'll go get a hot and ready from Little Caesers for about 1/3 that price and better pizza than Queens."}
{"text":"Great Pizza and Apps! The bartender last night was super nice and stayed open for us! Nice little place with good draft beer selection."}
{"text":"Yikes! I really wish I had read the reviews before coming here. The food here is pretty good, but the service is not great. 
We came in on a Friday night and stood in the front for a couple minutes before someone told us we could seat ourselves. Once we picked out table we sat for almost 15 minutes before we were taken care of. We tried to flag down a few people but no luck. The manager finally stopped by our table to ask if we had been helped and then found a girl to help us out. 
Ok, in our servers defense she looked really young like 16 or 17 and this is probably her first job. She just came off as a little timid and when we asked her questions about the menu or what was on draft her response was always, \"um, I'm not sure!\"

I ordered the bruschetta and my bf ordered the meatball sub. He said his sub was fine but I thought my bruschetta was delicious! It's a bummer because I really don't see us ever coming back. Judging from the other reviews, poor service seems to be the normal here. I watched the manager with his staff while we were there and the vibe with them seems to be very lax. Which is totally fine as long as long as stuff is getting done and taken care of, which unfortunately it wasn't."}
{"text":"Pizza is good fresh, but not 30 mins later. Pizza sauce is unique and has a nice gentle spice. Half the staff is nice. Charge for ranch that is super watered down. Won't go out of my way to eat it again, but was decent. A little pricey too,"}
{"text":"Yesterday was the second time my daughter and I came here with the kids after going to the Mesa Youth Museum for their free admission Sunday. Both times were a big success. If you have kids,  this is the place to go. Not only do they have kid-friendly foods, but they have an amazingly kid-friendly atmosphere. If your little ones get a little rambunctious or fussy, you'll find no dirty looks here. They couldn't be more friendly and welcoming to your family. The owners are very friendly, too. After we were done eating the first time we went there, a month ago, we sat around swapping family stories. 

We got the two slice special with drinks for $5.99 the first time we went there. The first time it was good, but yesterday it was hot out of the oven and really, really delicious, moist and chewy and cheesy. Last time we got an order of Popcorn Chicken,  $1.99, for the toddler and he had to fight us off for  bites if it,  it was so good! This time we were told they no longer carry those so we got a $2.99 order of Chicken Tenders, three in the basket. They were okay and again he loved  them. Last time we got two scoops of their delicious ice cream to  share, and this time we got the Cannilonis which were delicious. If you have  just been to the Mesa Youth Museum they give you 10-20% off your meal, can't remember which. 

I think we may have started a family tradition, Youth Museum on their free Sunday, then Queens Pizza for dinner!"}
{"text":"I do not know what is worse, the food or the service. We came in around 7 with a party of 6. We sat for around 30 minutes waitung for menus in an average filled room. After the wait, I asked what i perceived was the bartender if we could get menus to order. After 15 minutes he returned to take our order and then discovered that if he had to do drink and food orders he would have to go get a pen. Another 10 minutes had past until he returned. He finally took our order. I ordered the buffalo chicken pizza and ordered the breadsticks for my son. 45 more minutes passed and we had a table full of empty drinks and at this junction were the few left in the building. When our food finally arrived it was segmented. We were missing a salad, cheesebread and breadsticks. After about 10 minutes into the meal, I flagged down our server and inquired about my son's breadsticks .  He informed me the breadticks were the hardest thing on the menu and took the longest. He then let me know that he was a manager and was not supposed to be even serving. He said 2 employeea called off and he could barely see straight. He said that the owners were in the back cooking. Still without the breadsticks, I request they be removed. My meal was horrible. The buffalo chicken pizza was like a saltine cracker with tuna and tabasco. It was completely bland and had no kick, a fail for $14. The buffalo chicken sandwhlich was the equivalent of deepthroating a salt lick. When we requested the bill be split, the server\bartender/manager asked if we were joking and we kept asking for too much. I would have preferred to eat a little ceaser's hot ready that has been dropped on the ground. The way that this place is ran is like lord of the flies where the employees are as confused as the customer. I could not reccomend this place to anyone. I took a year off from this place and came back. I guess i will have to wait another year if this place is still in business."}
{"text":"I was here during the second Friday event in Downtown Mesa. It was unclear whether you were to seat yourself or order at the bar or even wait for someone to greet you. My girlfriend and I waited AT LEAST 30 minutes before we were even acknowledged. We ordered our food and drink when we were finally acknowledged. The one drink took about 20 minutes to get and the food took more than hour to come out. You could tell the place was full of chaos, severely understaffed, and extremely unorganized. The wait was hardly worth it, since we rather have waited than have our time wasted. The food was mediocre as the wings were a bit undercooked and soggy. The chicken Parmesan sandwiches were decent. This place was great before the new launch, however I won't be back until they get it together."}
{"text":"Super yummy pizza, awesome atmosphere, and open until 10pm?! Yes, please!!! Will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"We decided to go for pizza, deciding to give the menu a try. The food was great! We ordered the Queens Bruchetta for an apetizer.  It was great, with fresh flavors and light. The only downside was that it came at the same time as our Pizza.  Deciding to overlook this as our visit was during one of the 2017 NCAA Final Four games, the place was busy but not crowded. The pizza, a thin crust cheese and pepperoni creation, was awesome! So far it's the best pizza we've ever had.  I do mean EVER.  Give this place a try! Like us, you'll be back."}
{"text":"Great little pizza place on Main Steet Mesa. Pizza is pretty good, though not the best I've ever had. I go there quite a bit because the kids and I frequent the museums down nearby there, as well Milano's Music Store for my students' music supplies. Plus, if you check in there with the Yelp app, you're $2 off. It says new management but everything seems the same to me. Lots of cool artwork on the walls as well and some classic arcade games."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY HORRRRRRRRIBLE.

Service was CRAP - literally took more than an hour to get our food. Do NOT come in during a rush or when there are big parties sitting around and to be honest, don't even come when it's slow. Service seems to be about the same either way.

Food was CRAP - 12\" pastrami pizza: IT HAD NO PASTRAMI and it didn't taste like honey and wasn't sweet because it was masked with an excessive amount of onion. Wings: BARELY had any sauce which it DESPERATELY needed it because the wings were over-fried. I felt like I was eating twigs off a tree.

Employees - one of the girls was very apologetic about everything but the rest act like you don't even exist. Maybe because they were embarrassed to see that we were still sitting there after an hour with nothing. And omg, the manager was walking around with a pizza box under his armpit then walked around ate pizza around the starving customers. What a douche.

STAY AWAY."}
{"text":"I've been to Queen's twice, and both times, the pizza was delicious. Very cheesy, and the sauce is perfectly formulated. 

However, the food is not the only upside. The decor is unique and contemporary. The staff is friendly, and they tend to treat their customers right. The kind of customer service you don't tend to see around very often these days. 

Oh, and it's wonderfully affordable.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I'm rating them on the sandwiches, NOT the Pizza. I will return for Pizza.  

The bread in my opinion was a little heavy and overpowering on the Rosemary flavor. Though it was a toasted sandwich the meats which are sliced very thin as they should be were way over cooked to the point of being literally dried out which sucks the flavor out. 

I will come back and try the Calzones and Pizza before forming an official opinion but sandwich wise, STRIKE 1!!

Being the only couple in there at the time, service really lacked. I should not have had to go to the bar to get an iced tea refill. The bartender was a little to busy chatting with co-workers."}
{"text":"I eat here usually when I'm downtown, it's a great little pizza joint. The pizza is good, two slices always fill me up. Only complaint is sometimes the slices look like they've been sitting for a while and I need to remind the staff to heat them up. But its still good."}
{"text":"Bri and Glenn D. were kind enough to show me around my own hood and picked out one of the best pizza joints I've been to in a while! This place can be summed up in one word: character. This place is over-flowing with 'let's go back again and again and again.' kind of character. The Pizzeria is located in the front of the store and there is an entrance from the back too. I think they are working to combined the bakery and the pizzeria into a cohesive location. The Pizza was AMAZING! The crust was soft, dense, chewy goodness. The sauce had a hidden sweetness to it, that was just subtle enough to make you want more. Both orders from Bri and Glenn looked amazing too. 

The seating is intimate, but the front windows are floor to ceiling huge, which give the space a very open feeling (plus the wall that divides the front of the store from the back of the store was only a half wall so that also kept the space open) They have seating all along the front window - so it's definitely a place to successfully people watch without the strange stares when you get caught :} and the art on the wall was cool, the old brick walls were cool - everything added to the character of this place! 

I will definitely go back and I'm so glad I was invited to try this place out. Thanks Bri and Glenn for trying something in my own back yard!"}
{"text":"This past time I was there the service was amazing. The time before that, not so much. The garlic knots are great and the happy hour prices are good. The cannoli I got was only partially filled but even then, it's the best I've had in the valley. For pizza, I prefer Pizzamart further down main, but if you want a cool atmosphere and a guy willing to make you creative drinks at the bar, stick with Queens"}
{"text":"Phenomenal pizza! Well, I realize it's all subjective, but I love the huge portions of cheese, the quality of the cheese, the dough, the sauce. Just divine! 

I've also had their meatball cheese subs and their gyros. These are also top shelf!"}
{"text":"We wanted to try a new pizza place, so we gave Queens a shot. It's not the worst pizza you'll ever have, but it's not good either. 

Garlic knots: These came to the table undercooked. When you tore one open, there were large parts of raw dough. We had a terrific server (Liv/Lev?) and she had them remade right away, plus comped them for us.

Pizza: My husband and I shared the Isabella pizza. It was way over sauced, and extremely stingy with the cheese. I believe it's like a margherita pizza, which isn't typically covered with cheese, but it still felt like Queens used too little.

Our server did a great job, checking on us often and refilling our drinks. We just needed the food to be better, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Went in on a slow Sunday evening, three of us sat down and waited about 10 minutes. As we waited another, bigger group sat behind us. The first waitress we saw went to them and took their order. So after 10+ minutes of getting looks from the bartenders and the bar flies, we left. Maybe there \"bar food\" type menu would have provided good food but I'll never know. Ever."}
{"text":"My one night feeding just myself and i decide to order pizza only to discover they closed 2 hours early because it was too slow and the girl on the phone has the gall to laugh about it. Its 8 freekin' PM!! They lost my business for life."}
{"text":"We were really looking forward to a good local place since we live in downtown. I have NEVER been more disappointed with a restaurant. It took forever to get our food & when the bill came our 16 inch pizza was double charged. We asked if we could get a 12 inch specialty as a 16 & our waitress Mandy said \"yes, it will be more expensive\" she never said 'we'll charge you for both the 12 & the 16 inch -- which is exactly what she did. When we complained and said there were too many pizzas charged on our bill she said everyone complains & there was nothing she could do. We will NEVER be back & we'd like to warn everyone that this place is the biggest rip off in downtown. I feel like I was completely robbed if I could give zero stars I would."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my meal and atmosphere at this little cafe on Main. It's been recently remodeled and I like it. The manager was friendly, and made a point that we were taken care of.  Our waitress was so nice, she recommended trying different things on the menu, and I am so glad I listened to her. We showed up at the most optimal time, because it got super busy later on. I really liked the decor, and everyone had something fun, and different. It's worth the time and wait, I will be back again."}
{"text":"This place has superb pizza, however, it isn't very well ran. After reviewing the menu online, I called in to order and the listed specials were non-existant, also many of the items on the menu had changed(including prices). I ordered pizza and wings and the pizza was delicious, but the wings were soggy(probably frozen) and came with ultra watered down ranch dressing. If I return I won't be ordering anything other than a slice of pizza and a fountain drink because that's all it seems that they do well here."}
{"text":"I went here for a poetry reading/concert that a friend who was on tour had booked.  They do slam poetry once a month or something here, great readers.

The place itself is totally cute.  Checkerboard floor and chalkboard signage.  The pizza and sandwich selection is ample and mouthwatering.

I had an Italian cold cuts sandwich.  Served hot with red peppers and lots of cheese, this sandwich was amazing.  I think what set it off was the bread.  It was so good I knew my friend had to try it, so I traded him my second half for his meatball.  The meatball was also awesome, very saucy, good spices in the balls.

The thing about this place which I love, just like Otto's in Tempe, is that it is a family run business, run with love for the people and food he serves.  When I mentioned my liking of the bread he patted a bag of flour and made a point of the fact that it is never frozen, nothing ever is, he makes the dough each day.

There is going to be an expanded bakery in back, a cake shop I think.  This place is going to really hum when they have both businesses going.  Mesa is lucky.

At the end of the night, the owner was overly appreciative of my friends words and music.  He asked for an encore and bought one of my friends cd's.  What a guy."}
{"text":"I ordered Italian fries. I waited for almost an hour and when they finally came out, they were hard as a rock , cold and completely inedible. I told the bartender they were horrible but he didn't do anything about it and took my money bc anyway! Never again."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. They've remodeled the layout to have a nice bar, but searing is available inside and out with tables as well. The menu, however, hasn't changed too much, which is a great thing. Their sandwiches are amazing and hit the spot each time. I suggest the Royal Flush. Beer list is good and they also do slices."}
{"text":"My family likes to visit Queen's. It can be hit or miss with the service. They don't do well under pressure, but if you happen in when there isn't a rush, you will get great pizza and awesome service.

UPDATE: The last couple times I have been here the service has been outstanding. Is there a new manager? Plus, the bruschetta is all I can think of. Changing my rating, adding a star."}
{"text":"Came here while killing an afternoon waiting for a movie . At first I was a little annoyed because it took forever to get a menu, and our order in . But once we were finally acknowledged the service improved a lot . We just ordered a cheese pizza . I absolutely loved this pizza it was soo tasty plenty of cheese a nice flavor great crunchy crust . I will definitely be back and would love to try more options . Hopefully service is better right off the bat . It is a small place with a small crew . Pizza is worth the wait!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Had both the meatball sub and the chicken Parmesan sub. Really really good. Portions are huge and great quality. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The last time we visited (my son and I) we sat at the bar. My son is 10 and he was beaming that he got to sit there with me over a pizza wing and a coke. The staff is excellent and the food has real flavor and the wings are not undercooked or overcooked they get it right each time. It was the weekend of the science fair and we had our projects on the bar and the staff just worked around us. That is why I'll be back the food is good but I'd expect that in a place that has good traffic the staff makes it better. I'll be back again when its the art walk have my beer and enjoy the art."}
{"text":"Amazing! I was really impressed with my whole experience! Their staff is friendly, I really loved their pizza, and everything is priced just right! I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a tasty and fun pizza experience!"}
{"text":"Came in before a show at the arts center. Good pizza, used the check in deal.  Nice casual spot for families to get some pizza."}
{"text":"I love pizza and supporting small business so me and my wife gave this place a shot. The inside was pretty cool and I liked the garage door look they had but then we realized it was basically a bar that serves pizza in the day. The garlic knots were actually the best thing we ordered and I could recommend those. As for pizza I do not recommend the lasagna pizza. The waiter said it was his favorite but it was definitely not mine. It was pretty flavorless."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place.  We ordered for pickup and thought it was a little pricey, but I thought it was going to be awesome so I didn't mind.  For good pizza I don't mind paying or even driving far.  I have driven to Glendale from Mesa for La Piazza Al Forno, and when I found Queens in my own town I thought I found the perfect local place.  

We didn't check the pizza when we picked it up, and that was a mistake.  When we got it home we found the crust was burnt to charcoal status and the whole pizza was pretty bad.  It was supposed to be \"grilled pineapple\" and the bottom was tough and chewy and the top was watery and soggy.  There was nothing grilled about the pineapple but the crust was black and burnt to a charcoal-like crisp.  It was a completely opposite experience from what we expected.

If we would have eaten in the restaurant we would have without a doubt complained and I'm sure they would have replaced it, but we were already back home and didn't want to be bothered.  As it is, it's probably been months since this incident and we were thinking about pizza and I remembered I had these pictures on my phone and hadn't submitted my review. 

 It was disappointment in the truest sense."}
{"text":"I had seen an ad for this place in the East Valley Tribune's Best of East Valley publication last March. Since I live near downtown Mesa, it was on my ....list of \"we'll eat there one of these days!\" 
Last night was THE NIGHT. We parked in back, being familiar with the old Tribune building I knew there would be parking back there. So, we entered from the back. Came down a long hallway but could smell the pastry. 
We saw the kitchen, very open, workers working hard and the cashier had quite a long line of mostly teenagers and few of us middle aged people in line. A little bit of everything. 
We made it through the line, someone in front of us ask us if this was our first time and we said Yes. She said to order the Ace of Spades, as it was a meatball sandwich. I thought I wanted pizza and hubby wanted the meatball sandwich, so I went for the chicken Parmesan. 
We did wait quite awhile, seemed like too long as we were pretty hungry, but as busy as the place was, we really didn't mind people watching as it was down town Mesa'a 2nd Friday and they were having a character contest. Kinda fun and creepy to have zombies (alive ones) peering in the windows, but it did entertain us for awhile. 
Once our food came, I was surprised how big the sandwiches were and the bread, looked like homemade bread. It was so warm to touch but then I dared and the food was just perfect temperature to eat. I was worried that it would be sloppy because the chicken parm was cut up in small pieces, but that just made it easier to eat. It stayed together VERY well and just a few small pieces dropped, but they didn't sit there for long. Hubby was really enjoying his very full of meatballs sandwich. 
It's the bread...that was to die for....it's got me craving it already again this morning. It will be on our new - eat list - especially being open on Sunday!!!! 
I am looking forward to eating there again and trying the pizza, but I can't imagine it being better than that chicken parm!!!!!
Decor was fun, seating was full, but it was fun to see one huge table for about 16 people to sit at -- it was always full of teens, but that's ok!
It's right next door to a GREAT antique and scrapbooking store...bonus for me. 

DOn't wait-- go there NOW!"}
{"text":"Stayed in Mesa for an Every Time I Die show and ate here twice. The spot is snugged in a sweet area on the city's main strip. It's right around the corner from the Nile Theater and is some of the best pizza I've ever had. First night we had buffalo chicken pizza and honey hot wings. Well, it was amazing so we ate there again without any guilt of doing so. Was gonna try a pastrami sandwich the next day but bread wasn't available so the server suggested trying it on a pizza. A pastrami pizza with provolone cheese and mayo/spicy mustard on the side. Superb. We order two rounds of honey hot wings. Hands down, it made the trip that much more better. Kudos to Queen's...I'll be back anytime I'm in town. My girlfriend is addicted to your wings."}
{"text":"I had the worst dining experience here that I've had in about five years.  When we arrived, the dining room didn't seem too busy.  (After we had been there awhile--and had already ordered-- a large group that can only be described as Mesa's version of Comic Con arrived.)  We sat down and ordered an appetizer of garlic knots (ultimately delish when they finally arrived), a sandwich, and a pizza.  We asked for 1/4 of the pizza to not have any toppings, just cheese, so that my three year old could share with us.

We waited a half hour for the garlic knots.    After about 20 minutes, I asked the waiter how long they usually take.  He responded that they take less than 10 minutes.  He promised to follow up with the kitchen, but never returned.  When I raised my concerns to the manager, she said there were only two workers in the kitchen, which was causing a delay.

The pizza and sandwich took approximately 25 minutes more.  When the pizza arrived, it was not made correctly.  Instead of being just cheese on 1/4, and all toppings on the remaining 3/4, it was all toppings on all, but only using 1/4 the amount of normal cheese.  :(  As a result of having so little cheese, it was burned, and had the taste/texture of a burnt cracker.  The waiter offered only to return it to the kitchen to have it remade.  With two hungry kids, and Mesa Comic Con in full swing, that did not seem like a palatable option.  Instead, we requested a plain cheese piece (they sell them by the slice and then heat them up quickly) for my son.

When the bill came, we were surprised that we were charged fully for everything--the 30 minute garlic knots, the incorrectly made pizza, the slice of cheese pizza.  I didn't expect them to give us the whole thing free, but seriously?  The waiter apologized and assured us if we came back he \"would take care of [us].\"  How about taking care of us this time?  (He ultimately removed the $2.50 slice of cheese pizza from the bill at our request.)

We were terribly disappointed with the speed, the service, and the food."}
{"text":"What happened? I used to LOVE this Downtown Mesa gem. I went in for lunch today and it was horrible. I was there at 11 AM right when they opened and they were already out of slices. Ok, no problem, they made more. I waited and it didn't take long to get my order. I got two slices and a soda, their lunch special. They double stacked the slices in one slice box and they stuck together so all my toppings from the bottom piece were on the bottom of my top piece. The quality was so subpar for them. The pizza tasted old, super chewy in not a good way. It's Monday, they are closed on Sundays, shouldn't it have been fresh dough? This is the second time in 2 months this has happened on different days. The quality and awesomeness has left. So sad."}
{"text":"My friends and I stopped in after a night of comic book shopping at Gotham City Comics right down the street. The building is really cool with the exposed brick, art work on the walls, and my personal favorite, the cocktail table Pac Man game! The pizza was super good and very reasonably priced! My girlfriend and I got a 20 inch pepperoni pie, garlic cheese bread, 6 wings, and 2 drinks for just under $30. The pizza is thin crust awesomeness! The guys working there were very cool people as well! They talked, and joked around with us, and made the night that much more fun! We've already decided that we will be back after every comic book meeting we have. This place started a new tradition for my friends and I. Definitely stop by if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Happy hour is great cheap beers while watching the game and pizza was amazing crust was fabulous on the cheesy pepperoni goodness !! And the warm chocolate brownies are delicious !"}
{"text":"Great stop for lunch in downtown Main in Mesa. The staff is always friendly and the pizza is always good."}
{"text":"Our server was amazing!! I seriously wish I could remember his name. The rest of thie experience was not good. We came i\on bike night. Place is understanably packed. We put our name in on the wait and went to bar to grab a drink. The bartenders while busy, were not attentive in any way. We finally got drinks, mine was nothing but 7Up/Sprite, no seven to be tasted or seen. Sucked. 

We get sat, were promptly greeted by a seriously awesome younger male server. I told him my drink sucked, he got it fixed. We ordered a pizza with extra feta and salami. It was good, well, actually just okay. It was under cooked , very undercooked. Other than the awesome server and the fact that we spoent nearly 30 bucks for just the pizza (that we couldnt take home because the togo box situation was limited to a traingle box that would leak in the saddlebag of the bike).

Probably will not return."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now for a quick lunch. Both times the place was pretty quiet (it was a weekday) and the service was great and the food was delicious.

Edit: spelling"}
{"text":"-Pretty good pizza.

-I think I paid just under $3 for a single slice of cheese pizza?

-Cool decor.

-Smell draws you in from the street.

-Cashier was friendly (and kept looking at the\"tip\" cup next to the register)."}
{"text":"I have only gotten my appetizer and I already feel compelled to write this review. We got the garlic knots, and they are the most amazing thing I have eaten in months! Fresh bread, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with garlic and oil drizzled over the top. My family was fighting over them. 

Update: I removed one star because the service was very slow. We weren't in a huge hurry, but there were only a couple of tables. Once we had our food, we really didn't see the waitstaff again. I had to flag them down to get my check so we could leave."}
{"text":"i ordered a large mushroom/sausage \"well done\"  last week. upon arrival, theres a huge pizza box on the counter waiting for me. lady said $23 dollars and some change...im thinking this pizza is gonna be freaking awesome !!!   ha !!  after getting home and opening the box, the pizza was half the size of the monsterious box, it wasn't well done as ordered and ya, it was ice cold.... what a waste of $23.00 !!!  my friends son said it looks and tastes just like the pizza u get from the high school cafeterira."}
{"text":"Front cashier girl was pleasant as was the cook. I called an order to go after reading some reviews on Yelp, since I live down the street. 

+I liked the layout inside

+Service was decent

+Pizza was decent, Salad was made with quality ingredients, Wings had good spice to them

- Wings were super fatty and skin was soggy. The pizza dough was really tough so since my daughter could not bite through, a cheesy, saucy mess ensued as she tried to eat everything but the crust. I liked the pizza, but it does not appeal to families with smaller children.

-Even after a $2 coupon from Yelp, it was over $30! I didn't mind the cost because I thought I would get the quality. To pay that much, the pizza would have to be adorned with more of the topping, and a fresher quality ingredient at that. The chicken had to be the cheapest the wholesaler has.

This is how I came to 3 stars. If the quality improves enough, I can see paying that much and give them 5 stars. If they just keep it the same, but charge less, I would have not as high expectations and enjoy the food more. Possibly giving 4 maybe 5 stars."}
{"text":"Queen's has moved. Queen's has evolved. QUEEN'S SERVES BOOZE NOW, YAY!  Queen's has become the restaurant I eat the most meals from, because I work about a block away. We also order sandwiches for our events. It's also becoming my new happy hour haunt, as their prices are AMAZING! I love the new location, the staff is brilliant, and I'm so heading over for two slices after I finish writing this review. 
Highlights include garlic cheese bread, Queen o' Hearts sandwich, and any freshly made pizza.. or the great 2 slice special for $5.99 (lunch). 
Craft beer, wells, and domestics at happy hour are just $3! 
So are select appetizers. Yay for Queen's! Queen's, pls! :D"}
{"text":"Their knowledge of the beers on tap, and the selection is pretty good - the best part was we were able to sample a few new ones. Their Philly Cheese-steak is great and their bread is amazing!

And you have to try their honey-BBQ wings. They take organization natural honey and mix it in in house! Finger-licking good!!

Definitely recommend to anyone looking for a laid back, scrumptious meal:)"}
{"text":"They are priced like they know they're the only game in town. The food is too expensive - $49.00 for a child and two adults, my husband had a $5 Guinness and I had a metered pour of $4 Pinot Grigio, not bad prices, then came the food. They served  my salad in a styrofoam takeout container with plastic cutlery, the miniature size of the salad dressing container was warning enough that a steep price would be paid for a second. It was a good salad and dressing the chicken I got on top had a lot of \"gristle\" , the bacon was fine. My husband got Stromboli , ordinary but good, he got a real fork and knife and was served on a pizza sheet. Daughter got a cheese pizza.   It was 15 to 20 mins before our drinks came about 15 to 20 more for food. I really wish the place had actual dinnerware and was more appropriately priced, the bar is a great addition."}
{"text":"Great pizza for AZ, and I love that they host a Poetry Slam every Thursday."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times and the only time its been slow were the art walk days. Food is great and well worth it, definitely a family favorite for us. Best Pizza/Garlic knots in Mesa! 

Thanks!!"}
{"text":"Poorly staffed. A lot of excuses, but no service.  I had been before and food was ok. Could not get anyone to wait on me. Never even got a water.  So I left and went somewhere else as many others did."}
{"text":"The new location is nicer, but the service is really going downhill. We've visited about once a month, and each time there's some minor screw up. The pizza is inconsistent, but it's pretty good when they're on their game. 

On a busy night, don't bother. You'll be disappointed by the service. They're not managed well enough to handle a crowd. But on a quiet night, it's a good place for an average meal."}
{"text":"Love this place small but perfect neighborhood bar! Cool inside even with the garage door open, what a beautiful day!  Bartender Matt aka the Doctor very cool and super knowledgeable. We will be back lol"}
{"text":"Wow. 

I tried being nice when they got my order wrong. I tried being nice when I I had to wait for them to correct.  I tried to be nice on the ride home, kinda excited for what I had hoped was an authentic New York pizza. I get home, open the food and think, \"WTF\".

After showing up to pick up my food, I confirmed everything with the woman behind the bar. Most of it was incorrect - she blamed everything on the owner. She promised to have everything corrected and even comped me the toppings on the pizza. 

I get home and find that the $10 sub is a meager sub roll with some slivers of meat and a dash of vinegar. The wings had almost no sauce on them and the garlic rolls looked like a failed attempt at funnel cake.

What made me post here was the pizza. Seriously? I know that it was incorrect and you needed to fix it, but throwing some deli sliced pepperoni on does not a pepperoni pizza make. (See photo) It's a damn disgrace - and don't try to play the \"it's the way we make our pizza!\" All of the photos on Yelp prove you wrong, and if I happened upon the night you decided to change your recipe let me tell you - what a mistake you made. Any good New Yorker would throw you out of their restaurant faster than you can say \"Anchor Bar\". 

Disappointing. Seriously disappointing. If this is because of some, \"it's the middle of the week, we were slow\" excuse, get it together. No self respecting restauranteur should allow food like this out of their establishment."}
{"text":"They have a bar now! 

Just parked to come in for my usual lunch special.. And was a bit confused but happily surprised. 

Queens has changed.. 

1. They have a bar,  a real bar! 

2. They moved next door.. Fully renovated and they have a kitchen out back now.. Hello new sit down menu option

3. They have servers now,  sit down,  order and they will bring your check when your done. 


Owners have shown a serious commitment to down down and I for one and happy to see it. 

With more down town activities,  the Nile and also the art center putting together venues it speeds for great things to come and a nice option for done town. 

Thanks!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this place because it was close to out hotel and fellow yelpers gave it 4 stars.  We ordered a pizza and drinks.  It definitely wasn't the best pizza we've ever had but it was okay. The restaurant was clean and the staff seem friendly."}
{"text":"Good happy hours... $3 drafts... and house wines.. pizza was hot hot and hot.. sparse on the sausage but.nit worth worrying about. It was so good it hit the spot. .. the garlic knots were on the happy hour... hrr had to have them... guiltily.. they are super delicious. .. the crispiness and savory garlic makes you want nothing else... 
Angry orchard on tap... way worth trying.."}
{"text":"I am a visitor in a strange land. OK, so not really that strange but none the less being from Austin, TX I don't get to see many mountains. This place kind of looks like what i picture mars looking like. Anyway, I degrees. I got to my hotel and in a attempt to save my company more cab fair i searched for a local place that delivered to my hotel. So I hopped on yelp, as is the usual case, to find a good spot and i landed on Queen's Bakery & pizzeria. 

Enticed by their offerings i called them up and told the woman on the line that I would like to make an order for delivery. Then to my sadness she informed me that they do not offer delivery. Has my Yelp forsaken me? She apologized, I assured her that it was fine and that I would still be interested in walking to the restaurant and getting an order to go. Well Shelly (The woman on the line) would hear nothing of it. She informed me that she was about to leave work and that my hotel was on her way home so she could bring my order too me. ( It's no surprise that at this point I (Heart) Shelly). 

About 30 minutes later Shelly gave me a call to inform me that she had left and was on her way. I met her outside of the lobby, got my pie, exchanged pleasantries and retreated to my room to enjoy the delicious smells that were coming out on the box 

I ordered Kind \"O\" Hearts, a choose your own 6 topping monster of a pizza. Hearty enough, even with my large appetite to give me three meals worth of food. You wouldn't know it (or maybe you do I shouldn't assume) but Austin has it's fair share of great pizza. Whether you get Home Slice, East Side Pies, or South Side Flying Pizza they're all tops in my book and this pizza was right up there with them.

You can tell that dough is home made, and the toppings are plentiful and fresh. I'm so glad that (A Thai place that is in the same area that I'm not sure if I can say their name) didn't pick up the phone each of the three times i tried to call them or i would have missed out on this wonderful experience. And again, Thank You Shelly"}
{"text":"Probably the most UN-fancy pizza I've ever ordered in a restaurant. . .and yet, delicious.  The first time I visited here, I was surprised at how tasty and satisfying the pie was.  I've been here a number of times and I am consistently impressed by these folks.

The joint is fairly small and dominated by the bar, so seating can be challenging on busy weekends, especially when there's some Main St, event going on.  Service is excellent and friendly, although, again, this can slow down a bit on busy weekends.

Apart from pizza, they have sandwiches and salads (which are a bit on the pricey side, but great).  Tables and chairs spill out into the sidewalk on pleasant days (watch for bees).

The building is obviously quite old, and the alcove in the men's bathroom has bricks with painted marks indicating \"shoeshine\".  Makes me wonder what other businesses occupied this spot in days past.

Not just some non-descript pizza spot, Queen's is actually one of my favorites.  Every time we take our daughter to the Nile for a show, I know that this is another opportunity to go and eat at Queen's."}
{"text":"So my sister and I had absolutely no choice but to eat here. We rarely travel out to Mesa, but we were attending an event out there. First off, why are restaurants closed on a Sunday? After driving and walking around trying to find something we ended up settling for this place. It wasn't too busy, about 4 tables occupied and a few people at the bar. One they're service isn't great because they only had two servers, which is fine, but at least come to the table periodically and apologize for the wait. Our waitress was only coming back for our drinks. It took almost 40 minutes before we got our appetizers and about another 20 before we got our meals. Didn't receive any type of, \"Your food is almost ready.\" Or just a nice gesture of some sort. It left both my sister and I unapologetic with tips. She didn't even come back to see if the food was good or if we needed anything else. The ONLY thing that saved this place from getting a lower rating was their garlic cheese bread. Even if I lived remotely close to Mesa, this would be my last place to eat at.

Oh, yeah and they have NO SOAP DISPENSERS IN THE BATHROOM!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place was ok. The service was really slow. I had a meatball sandwich which was \"eh\". I like more sauce than the little drop on it. My boyfriend has the Philly cheesesteak which he says was only alright...nothing special. We'd go again if we were in the area but won't be going out of our way to go back."}
{"text":"Queens Pizza was THE WORST dinning experience that I can remember. Walked in and placed an order to go. We waited so long the young staff finally brought the garlic bread for us to eat while waiting. Then after 40 minutes they brought the pizza on a pan and not in a box, saying our wings were on the way. After another 10 minutes they brought us half our wings, saying they dropped the other half an it would be another 10 minutes.After waiting for another 10 minutes they said they dropped our wings again (I didn't even know what the kid meant by dropped)! So he gave me a refund for the half of the wings; I thought it was nice because I did not have to force them to give me some type of compensation for my time, but I was wrong. 

After waiting another 15 minutes, a total of just under a HOUR AN A HALF for a to go order, I went to counter to ask the kid where my wings were when he told me they gave me a refund so they weren't making the wings. I could not believe it! He saw me sitting there waiting for wings, and acted like I was in the wrong for not understanding a refund for the wings = they gave up even trying to give me what I ordered. After waiting 90 minutes for my to go order, I did not even receive my entire order.

I will NEVER GO HERE again. The food was not bad, but dealing with incompetent children making and serving my food is not worth pizza I can get at any other NYC joint. They have no respect for customers and it was a joke."}
{"text":"This joint use to have some excellent pizza dough, but they are currently using frozen dough that tastes like a stale tortilla.  Perhaps you have to come in during the right time, but the last couple of times we've been there, the pizza dough has been extremely sub-par.  We've officially crossed them off our list.   Yes, it was that bad.  We even have half a pizza left, that neither of us wants to eat.

Good luck.

Update: 4/15/2015:  Been quite awhile since I've been here, so I'd like to give it another chance sometime.  I hear there's been quite a few changes since I left this review."}
{"text":"Queen is usually a good place to eat but service and wait time is ridiculous! We ordered about 20 min ago, waiting and still waiting it's now coming up to 45 min wait with no food  I support downtown businesses but they need to have another person in the kitchen or figure out a better system on food delivery. The stars are dwindling away as the wait time grows longer."}
{"text":"Great pizza and a nice environment. I got the pepperoni pizza. I usually like the thin crust pizza. This is more of a bread like crust which is great too. I really enjoyed the spice to it. I will most definitely recommend getting this pizza for a late night snack. 
This is the one type of pizza that I think everyone can enjoy."}
{"text":"I've been back a few times the past few months. Their pizza is better than before -- GREAT STUFF!

I had their meatball sandwich -- it is to die for. Big, meaty meat-balls in their fantastic marinara, covered with cheese and then thrown in the oven to melt into a delicious gooey sandwich of awesome.

I've taken my coworker twice now -- the pizza by the slice is fantastic. It's really, really, really good. Yum.

Thursday, we were shopping at Mystic Paper next door and decided to get dinner there, rather than cooking at home. The three of us shared two 10\" pizzas and an order of garlic-cheese bread. Absolutely delicious.

They are now hosting poetry slams every Thursday night at 8pm. I haven't made it yet, but it's really exciting that something's happening Downtown Mesa after 5pm."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in downtown Mesa! We stumbled in on a comedy night and we've been hooked since! Prickly pear bbq wings and the garlic knots have us coming back! Staff is very friendly and you can walk your food down to one of the locals bars not far from the restaurant!"}
{"text":"I had the worst pastrami sandwich in my life. It was like pastrami jerky and bread was hard. I will not go back."}
{"text":"This place opened three days ago and they are off to a good start. The location is a historic shop right on Main St. in Downtown Mesa. The decor is \"arty\" with lots of custom art for sale adorning the original brick walls. The owner is friendly and outgoing.  Plus, they have a couple of tables outside on the sidewalk with shade.

The Pizza is excellent (NY Style). I managed to get two slices and a drink for $5.50. They also bake and had a wide selection of pastries and specialty cakes."}
{"text":"Went here about 5 years ago and it was like an ice cream shop that sold pizza. Was in the area last night and popped in and wow was I surprised. They moved down a few doors and remodeled. Put in a bar and a hip seating area. The garage door was open onto main street. Lovely evening. The food was much better than I remember. The pizza was solid. Wings were great and the salad was also good. Decent selection of crafts beers.  Nice, knowledgeable staff.  Prices are reasonable. Looking forward to my next visit. It won't be 5 years like last time.  Probably next week"}
{"text":"I am honestly surprised that Queen's has received so many positive reviews.  I checked the address and business name twice before posting because I was certain that the place so many had reviewed so positively could not have been where my wife and I dined this evening.

We had high hopes when we saw the restaurant.  It is charming with natural brick walls in a space that looked like it was once a courtyard between two buildings that was converted to a storefront many years ago.  The walls are adorned with interesting artwork and the building is clean with ample space for seating and sidewalk seating perfect for people watching.

There is a sign on the front of the building stating that the restaurant no longer accepts Entertainment coupons, explaining that Entertainment wsa not authorized to publish the discount coupon.  We were hoping to use our coupon, but decided to eat there anyway to be able to sample another restaurant along Main Street in Mesa.

Service was pretty lackluster, but the girl was very new and seemed to lack both the energy and intellectual curiousity to learn the details of her job.  When my American Express didn't scan correctly (because they don't take Amex, which she didn't know) I asked her which cards they do accept and she simply told me \"I don't know\" while staring blankly at me without making an effort to find out.  Food was prepared in an acceptable amount of time and was delivered to our table because the cashier forgot to take our name.

We ordered the garlic knots and a pepperoni pizza.  The garlic knots were a bit overdone and the garlic flakes on top were burnt to a black crisp and had to be removed to avoid the overwhelming taste of burnt garlic.  The appetizer wasn't completely inedible but it was certainly not enjoyable.

When the pizza arrived I was absolutely shocked by the amount of grease floating on top.  We used a total of 23 napkins to soak up the most obvious of the grease on top of the pizza and, believe me, the napkins were fully drenched.  There was a slightly below normal density of pepperoni topping on the pizza and, after tasting the pizza, discovered that the sub-par grade of cheese they use contributed greatly to the grease.  The crust was pretty basic and not great, but not really bad - it was just overmatched by lots of cheap cheese and grease.  I absolutely love pizza and am generally good for 3 or 4 large slices of pepperoni but there was no way that I could finish two slices of this pizza.  Even after our blotting and draining of the oily slick that would have done BP proud, the pizza just wasn't edible.  I found myself apologizing profusely to my wife and wishing that we would have gone back to the charming Itallian cafe across the street and enjoyed one of their culinary pizzas.  It is interesting that one can find possibly the worst pizza in Mesa (Queen's) so close to some of the best pizza that I have tasted.

I certainly hope that everyone else continues to enjoy the food at this restaurant and that our experience was unique.  I know that we will never pass through the doors of the Queens Pizzeria ever again."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC food and experience!  if you are downtown for any reason I suggest this little place it was YUMMY!!!"}
{"text":"For my husband and I...Queens is a solid 3 star pizza place.  We showed up at 12:15pm on a Tuesday to order some quick slices of pizza & a salad (2 of their lunch specials).  

The staff was friendly.  But upon ordering our 2 lunch specials, we encountered a problem....no pizza to be seen.  They literally had 2 odd veggie/pineapple slices sitting there.  We asked if they had any in the oven and were told \"nope\" & that they would put in whatever we wanted - it would be about 15 minutes.  I also ordered a spinach/gorgonzola/raspberry vinaigrette salad.  The salad was huge for the price - it was 100% baby spinach, sliced cucumbers, sliced tomatoes, gorgonzola & dressing.

As we sat waiting for our pizza, others came in to also order lunch specials - they too were told that a new pizza needed to be put into the oven and it would be about 15 minutes.  After about 10-15 minutes I asked if I could have my salad while we waited (it was sitting behind the counter anyway....why not just pass it over to me?).  

Finally about 15+ minutes into our wait we get to taste this amazing pizza I have heard all about.....drummmmm roll please.......the result was \"meh\".  Dont get me wrong - its not bad at all....just average.  The sauce was a little on the spicy side (I know my little one wouldn't have like it) - hubby even asked if I put pepper on the slices. 

Mostly the 3 stars reflects the wait for the \"lunch special\".  Most pizza joints have pizzas ready & waiting for you so you can grab & go."}
{"text":"Tasty pizza. Service can be sketchy (long wait times, seems understaffed) but it's usually friendly.  It's my favorite local pizza spot."}
{"text":"Meh. Nothing to write home about. Also we had to place a couple of orders before the server stopped coming back with, \"we're out of that\". Beer menu seemed limited too."}
{"text":"Whoa this place is amazing.  I can't believe I found something edible in downtown Mesa.  One poor guy behind the counter banging out pizza, calzone, stromboli, and all sorts of other goodies - I'm impressed.  The calzone I ordered (meatball) was one of the best things I have ever had.  The sauce is sweet, the dough is garlicy, and the fillings are plentiful.  This place is not only somewhere I would tell other people to hit up but somewhere that I would make a special trip to go visit.  Fortunately for me, it's near Ashley A's house.  She better not serve me pizza hut again after showing her this place."}
{"text":"We love your vegan pizza! But we love your garlic knots made vegan even more! Thank you for giving us an excellent vegan pizza option in Mesa!"}
{"text":"We come to Mesa for Bikes on Main, but is always to crowded to get in here.
We were in Mesa and stopped in to be Pleasantly pleased.
We ordered Pizza with cheese, sausage, & basil. STELLAR pizza. Best I've enjoyed anywhere in U.S.
Derek & David make you feel like regulars.
EXCELLENT service and Well maintained establishment."}
{"text":"The employees are very polite and nice. They talk to you like they just met you on the side walk which is quite nice. But overall a great place to just relax and eat great food!"}
{"text":"This is not q bad pizza place to stop by in Mesa! Nice ambiance and colorful setting to eat at. What I don't like about this place is they only have whatever pizza is on display. I tried the pepperoni pizza..the sauce was a delight to the mouth.....the cheese and crust....standard....nothing special. At least better than the cheese pizza."}
{"text":"Came here before a show at Nile Theatre as it was located right next door. We ordered some pizza and asked what they had for a beer selection. Our server was not able to articulate anything he directed us to look get up and look at the beers lined up in the bar. The pizza was a bit greasy but overall not bad yet not memorable. Overall the service is awful as we came back after the show for additional beers and the horrible service continued as they seemed displeased to serve us as it was close to closing the kitchen but their bar was still open - we were only getting beers. Would not ever go back."}
{"text":"Horrible service!!!! Omg how hard is it to get napkins and the CORRECT food!!! My moms and my food came but my daughters meal didnt come until 10 minutes later. When i tried to get the waiters attention he just ignored me. My mom had to get up and basically follow him. 

Also the \"music\" they have outside their establishment SUCKS. Its noisy and not even real music!

I wish i could get my money back! 
Definitly not going to leave a tip..."}
{"text":"I have been here twice in the last year and each time I have been disappointed. I went there with three other people to scout it out for a November event I throw in downtown mesa. I like to try places out so when people come from out of town I can tell them where to eat. 

When we walked in we were not greated, the place was dead and two people standing at the bar just looked at us without saying a word. Awkward!

The waiter wasn't at all friendly and kind of had a \"why are you bothering me?\" kind of vibe about him. Had the same experience with the same guy the first time i eat there. 

The food wasn't good at all, i couldn't finish it, the bread tasted like freezer burn on the pizza witch i didnt  want to complain about because they would of just made another one that most likely would of tasted the same. Had some garlic bread that tasted the same way? But also tasted like they tried to cover it up with a lot of garlic. 

The only reason why i gave this place two stars is because the waiter was really good at refilling the drinks. 

Other then that this place has a very unwelcoming vibe  and maybe it was just us? I dont know? But im not bringing 50 people here in November to have to deal with the samething."}
{"text":"So I (finally) went back here the other day to pick up a pizza for dinner (and they were open!). I had an entertainment book coupon for half off a pizza, so I ordered a pretty big pizza and some garlic knots. I went to go pick it up, and there was a sign on the door that said they don't take the coupons because the book didn't have their permission to print it or something (but still.... it was in there and that's not the customer's fault).... so that kind of sucked, I wish I would have known before ordering such a big pizza... oh well.  The garlic knots were kind of burnt. They smelled really garlicky but didn't taste as garlicky. The pizza wasn't as good as it was last time, but it was still good. So I say this place is ok... but not as good as I originally thought."}
{"text":"VEGAN PIZZA SUCCESS! Absolutely stoked on the availability of alternative options. I'm writing this review on behalf of my vegan husband...we were guests at a catered wedding next door. My husband couldn't eat the meat and cheese loaded dinner served, so we slipped out and walked the block looking for an alternative. A sign in the window offering Vegan choices caught our eye. Placed an order, returned to the shindig and came back a few minutes later to grab the order. He scarfed some in the parking lot to tie him over, and was anxious to leave after the event to really dig in. He's eaten many-a-vegan pies, and concluded that it was the most flavorful version he's had yet! He's a great cook himself, and knows what he's talking about...keep up the good work. Maybe offer more selections, because you're sitting on a gold mine since you pull it off so well! I would have given 5 stars, but I think the atmosphere could be spruced up a bit. Some paint and disinfectant can go a long way."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had since I was last in NYC. The management change hasn't affected the food at all. It's still awesome! The staff is always very friendly and place is clean. I've never had anything bad to say about it."}
{"text":"Yet another Yelp revelation.  Thanks to all who glowingly reviewed this joint before me and convinced the Zombie Girl and I to check it out.  We're trying hard to support local, non-corporate type places like Queen's,  You should too.  Especially when it serves up awesomeness at great prices in funky-chic surroundings.  We showed up at about 7pm on a Wednesday, and the place was deserted.  There was a lot of friendly banter with the staff, who might have been the ownership family.  We ordered up a 16\" pep, and were informed that an 18\" crust was already ready to go, so that's what we were getting.  Cool!  The pie was awesome.  It's kinda generic looking, but in a good sort of way, like a pizza should look.  You know, not like some \"gourmet\" abomination served at some overpriced joint in North Scottsdale.  The crust was thin and fresh and delicious.  The sauce was sweet, fresh, and outstanding.  The cheese was slightly browned (Brak likes it that way) and tasted just right.  The pepperoni was.  Pepperoni.  Which means, it was great.

We'll definitely be back.  This is exactly the kind of place we like and want to support.  If you've read the other reviews and have been thinking about checking it out, quit screwing around and get your ass over there!  Queen's Bakery & Pizzeria earns Brak's coveted 5-star review, and is his \"executive selection\" for the month of June.  Whatever that means."}
{"text":"Wow. We are sitting here almost 40 minutes after ordering and still not even the appetizer. There are two other tables and no one at the bar. I thought maybe the first time it was a one off, this is the THIRD time and it is ALWAYS this slow.. simple pizza and appetizer should not take 40 minutes!!!! Won't be coming back..."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a zero. First time, I arrive at 2p on a Monday. I order the two slice special and thee are only three slices left in the heating rack.... Bad sign. Of course they are cold when I open it. I go to get a soda and the carbonation is out. There are only two workers and the poor kid that I asked to help can't fix it... It took him 15 minutes to try and fail before I asked to just exchange it for a bottled Coke... The bottles coke is the only star they get. Cold pizza, no soda... What else do you serve?"}
{"text":"Nice pizzeria. Decided to stop in for a late lunch (2pm on a Saturday) after visiting the Natural History Museum. Service was excellent, the server Allison was great and very attentive. The cheese pizza was good, but the specialty royal chicken pizza was great. The garlic bread was really good too, probably my favorite of all. If we are in the area we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Seriously the best place to go to for a fun night out or day date! I love the exposed brick and the huge open front to Main Street. I've been here several times and every time the food and service meets every expectation. Tried the garlic knots for the first time this last visit and OMG!!! My husband even said they were probably the best ones he's ever had."}
{"text":"I've been here once before and the pizza was good as was the service,but today I came back  with my family 9of us total. And it was such a horrible experience.We ordered 12 wings and two large pepperoni pizzas at 7:45 at 8:40 we finally got our 12 wings. The server that attended us told us that our order was delayed because the kitchen had dropped our wings & that they hadn't informed her,but she guaranteed us that it would only be five more mins for our orders to come out. I saw two other tables arrive/order/eat and leave. Before we even got our pizzas. Finally after waiting another 30 min I told her that I would like the check and that we wanted to leave. She said ok that we simply had to pay for the wings that we had already ate(which I was fine with) but that we had to also pay for the pizza(that we did not yet have) she said she wanted to go back and check on our order one more time and she then brought our pizza. To me it seamed like our order was forgotten/or she did not put the order in. They completely forgot about us and did nothing to communicate with us or check on us to see if we were ok.. She apologized for it taking so long and said she would take our drinks off the bill, but I feel after waiting literally over and an hour & 1/2 and all they do is take a couple drinks off my tab? .No thanks . We went downtown for the xmas event and because of how long they took we couldn't enjoy the rest of the booths.. by the time we got our food a lot of the vendors were closing, I won't be coming back. The customer service was beyond crappy.."}
{"text":"My mind says it's bikini season but my heart says pizza!

We were at Cider Corps with our visiting homie from California when we wanted some food with our booze. We ordered for takeout on the Yelp/Eat24 app for a Prosciutto Arugula Pizza ($14.99), 12pc. Garlic Parmesan Wings ($12.99), and two orders of cannolis ($5.99 each). In a matter of minutes, I paid online, got our confirmation, and an estimated pick-up time was given. I sent the crew over to pick it up and the pick-up went smoothly. When they got back, the wings were wrong and weren't the garlic parmesan I had ordered. We weren't going back so we ate the wings anyways. I didn't know the cannolis came three per order so imagine our surprise when we got six! 

The pizza was hot and heavy handed on the arugula and light on prosciutto. I wish the crust was cooked a little longer as well. The wings were a good size and the taste was very mild. I only had a small bite of cannoli but it seemed standard. All in all, I was content with our meal. Cider Corps normally has a different pizza place making pizzas on the premises that I prefer over Queens but Queens is okay!"}
{"text":"Favorite place to eat in Downtown Mesa.  Great food, great atmosphere and great servers!  Garlic knots, meatball sliders and pepperoni pizza, all excellent!"}
{"text":"This place sucks, plain and simple. I have now been here twice, each time ending with disappointment. 

The first time I ordered a couple slices of pepperoni pizza that had a congealed pizza sauce (very Ragu-like), a doughy, tasteless crust and it was served to me ice cold. Maybe it was an off day? 

My second visit was in hopes of finding a good cheesesteak sandwich. An advertisement I received touted their delicious homemade bread, what an overstatement...the cheesesteak was lathered in a nacho cheese sauce and it was overstuffed with dry meat and tasteless vegetables. The bread, similar to their pizza crust, was doughy and tasteless. To top it off, my sandwich took a half hour to come out and I was one of five people in the restaurant. The staff is unfriendly and they basically just sit behind the counter with their thumbs up their asses while they jerk each other off. 

If your looking for rotten food then this is the place for you. Otherwise, go to the store, take a trip down the frozen food section and microwave a pizza - it would taste better and cost less."}
{"text":"Service horrible.  Bartender/waitress continuously forgot to do things like clean our table, bring my drink, bring us plates.  Took them 15 to take our order, 15 min to bring us appetizers, than 15 mins to bring us pizza.   We had to keep going up to ask for napkins, plates, etc.  Pizza was ok but not worth returning.    The 2 stars are for the food only."}
{"text":"Good Pizza with sauce that was a little sweet for me. I fixed the sweetness with some red peppers. Got a free beer sample. Friendly staff. Got two beers and a small beer for less then $20.00. Will eat here again and if I am lazy will have it delivered."}
{"text":"My friend brought me here a few months ago and I tried the hatch chili pepperoni pizza which was very good.

I wanted to give four stars but the service was pretty lousy and both my friend and I were getting annoyed. They said the pizza would take a while to cook and my friend ordered a sandwich which they said would be right out and we waited a long time before any of it came and the pizza was actually ready before the sandwich.

We ordered some cinnamon twists or something and they were not very good."}
{"text":"Eep.

I hadn't been here in nearly a year and I feel AWFUL for recommending this place to my friends.  

When we arrived, the place was starting to get packed.  It was after 7 on a Friday night and a concert was next door.  The staff was clearly overwhelmed.

I didn't want to be the pain in the rear who ordered something special on such a busy night, so I went ahead and just ate whatever was ordered.  In this case, it was cheese pizza and a side of garlic knots with dip.

Everyone ate the cheese pizza.  By everyone I mean four adults and three children.  

I shared the garlic knots, but I was the only one who bothered dipping it in the lukewarm marinara.  The marinara, apparently, was used to toss meatballs into (as I later confirmed via telephone).  

When I ate the marinara, I remarked that it was sort of cold... which was not surprising since the place was packed and they could not really keep up.

That said, I ate quite a bit of it in my ravenous, gluttonous state.

I paid for it later.  Royally.  I won't get into details, but I will say that it is the worst case of food poisoning I have ever suffered or witnessed.

Apparently the restaurant doesn't dump out the sauce in favor of a new batch nightly.  The reason I say this is that when we called and told them about the illness, they volunteered to make a new batch afresh.  They said they avoid food poisoning by keeping the sauce and everything to temperature, per code.  As I mentioned earlier, the sauce was barely warm.  

I have had food poisoning before (see my reviews on Lucky Break), but I have to give Queen's 1 star because not only did I get food poisoning but...

1.) They overcharged us by several dollars, but it was too much of a hassle and inconvenience to mention it at the time.
2.) The tables were FILTHY, as was the floor and, as I learned from my kiddo and my friend, so was the bathroom.
3.) They lost half our order after waiting twice as long as estimated and we had to wait longer for the replacement.

Alas, I will not be back.  And, I apologize to those who read my four star review from April of last year only to find the place in similar condition.

Let's hope the conditions change soon, for the sake of the restaurateur."}
{"text":"SWEEEEET!  Don't you just love it when you have had a place bookmarked for so long that you almost forgot about it, and when you finally go it's amazing?  Yeah, that's what happened here.  We had been doing a little shopping out in this part of town and were starting to get hungry so we started searching for places to go.  The husband mentioned this place and I was quite enthusiastic and mentioned I have had it bookmarked for so long.  

We made our way over to the cute little store with it's big glass front and cool brick interior.  There's lots of cool music oriented art around and the tables are covered in graffiti.  Again, it's a pretty sweet place, aside from the lack of air circulation.  We stared at the gigantic chalkboard menu for a while (despite being chalkboard it's pretty easy to read) and finally made our selections.  I got the stromboli and the husband went with the meatball calzone.  The guy making our stuff was really cool and helpful.  The best part was that he really seemed to love his job.  You gotta love that.

When our food came out, the smell was intoxicating.  I dug right in and relished in the delicious garlicky dough and the sweet yet tangy sauce.  The ham was perfect and sweet and the pepperoni were meaty and spicy.  I tell ya, this stromboli was glorious.  It was glorious and HUGE!  I had to take half of it home, and yes, the leftovers were just as good.

I have a feeling that anytime I find myself in this neighborhood I am going to start salivating for the delicious goods here.  You should go.  You should also tell all your friends to go.  A place like this is too good to keep secret."}
{"text":"This place has good pizza and wings, but the wait staff can't handle a good sized crowd. Waited for 10 minutes and asked to have a dirty table cleaned up, waited another 5-10 minutes and nothing. You might get prompt service from the token greaser if you're a cute girl, otherwise steer clear unless it's dead. Sad, I had such high hopes for this place. More wait staff, signage saying seat yourself or hire a hostess maybe?"}
{"text":"I went in the other night on a calzone craving. I was a little disappointed to see how limited the menu was in that department and to top it off the restaurant wanted to nickle and dime me for every additional topping. By nickle and dime i mean $1 or $2, per topping, for small or large calzones, respectively. The most frustrating part was how small the large calzone was. It was maybe 7-8 inches in diameter, the dimensions of a small calzone at other Italian dives. 

The upside is the interior has been completely redone. The comprehensive makeover they gave this place really made it nice for the tier of restaurant this place is in. 

I havent tried other items on the menu but im the kind of guy who typically orders a calzone so its unlikely I will choose to come back here. Sorry"}
