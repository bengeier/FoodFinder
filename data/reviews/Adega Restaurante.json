{"text":"Great restaurant and nice atmosphere.  Service was very good.  I had the salmon and it was quite good."}
{"text":"I first went to Adega with my husband two years ago.  The decor is a little tiered, but the food and wine definitely makes up for it!  Our server was a delight and very knowledgable with their wine selection.  The food was delicious! The best Octopus meal I have ever tasted - which has brought us back on more than one occasion. It is definitely on our list of favourites in the city - you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation for the last slot, but my flight was delayed. I took a cab straight to the restaurant, hoping it would still be open. Alas, it was closed! But a server spotted me outside and once I explained my situation he graciously accommodated me.

I ordered the octopus and goat cheese salad. Absolutely delicious and cooked to perfection, I licked the plate. The colors were presented beautifully, leaving streaks of red and violet on my plate from the vinaigrette and sauce on the octopus. For dessert, I ordered the egg concoction, which was not too sweet and light. There was a mango and passion fruit salad on the side as well. It was exactly what I was looking for and the consistency was on point. I crave that dessert up to today. I took a white chocolate flan home, which was OK. Not as stellar as the egg dessert but the white chocolate flavor was noticeable.

I will definitely be back and would recommend this restaurant to anyone who is visiting Toronto and wants to try something different. I have had Portuguese food before, but not in such an elegant and relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"Flawless: going inside was like wow! Very impressed it felt warm and Cousy. Anyways I didn't come for that! It's all about the food. I hade the sea bass and it was the best I ever hade in my life. The cooks are number one. Wow"}
{"text":"This restaurant is conveniently located right next to Delta Chelsea. It's really a place to celebrate an anniversary or birthday without breaking the bank. We opted for a prix fixe and felt that it was worth the $ since it was both good and filling."}
{"text":"This restaurant has excellent location- it allows to quickly escape the busy downtown atmosphere for an authentic relaxed street.
The food is here is amazing ! I had octopus and pork belly appetizer and the squid entree, both of which we're exceptional. I tried a big of the shrimp entree as well and it was equally as delicious, a nice spicy sauce with perfectly cooked shrimp. Our service was fantastic and the server was very friendly, polite and knowledgable of the food. 
Reasonably priced for an excellent dining experience. 
Defiantly coming back here."}
{"text":"I had consistently heard good things about this place and decided on dinner here during the holidays. The ambiance here is quite nice, definitely the type of place that accommodates intimate conversations among couples or the coming together of groups of friends. 

The menu is seafood inspired. I had the chef' crab soup and crab risotto main, both were nicely done!"}
{"text":"Excellent risotto  and the grouper was very nice   Very pleasant servers. The flan was also  good."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this restaurant.  We are regulars and go there often.  I'm vegetarian so I really only have 2 entr√©e options---the mushroom risotto or a custom-ordered vegetarian pasta dish with olive oil or tomato sauce, but both are to die for. :D  I usually cannot resist the pasta dish because the made-from-scratch pasta is heavenly.  We love seeing our favourite waiter there and service is always impeccable.  

One time there was a new waiter who was not the usual (who would remember our usual orders!).  He misunderstood my custom-order vegetarian pasta and thought I wanted just pasta with nothing in it so that was what I got. XD  He felt so bad and immediately rectified it by getting the chef to rush up a pasta dish with vegetables in it for me.  But I was not upset or anything.  I just think back on that moment and laugh.  

The moral here is that it is okay to make mistakes as long as the clients still feel they are being treated with respect.  This is a great restaurant and we look forward to going there many times more. :D"}
{"text":"I would stay away from this restaurant. I went there just by myself , with no reservation and they told me it would take, at least 45 minutes. 4 other business guys, very well dressed and with no reservation, got a table within 2 minutes. What would you call to this?"}
{"text":"I had the scallop and bacon pasta.  The pasta seemed to be freshly made in house. It was flavourful but not overpowering. My only wish was that in came in a larger portion. 

My girlfriend had the tile fish which the server recommend. She was not disappointed. 

The desserts were also really good. I had the dark Lindt chocolate mousse and it was as good as it looked. Really good a must if you come here. 

The only reason I'm not giving Adega a 5 star is the server. He was great up until dessert. Before that, he was friendly, polite, filled our water promptly and answered our questions regarding the menu. The problem was he indicated he would be back soon to take our dessert order but disappeared for a good 15-20 mins. It wasn't busy either so not sure what happened. We were both getting impatient so had to ask another member of staff to order dessert. It slightly soured the experience but the food and service were fantastic up to that point so its a 4 stars out of 5"}
{"text":"Mario our server was fantastic and the food was incredible! Do yourself a favour and get the cataplana"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants downtown. I order the cataplana every time I come here, it is delicious. They have a wide variety of seafood dishes and they are all lovely. Would highly recommend to anyone. Prices are above average but not too expensive."}
{"text":"The food at this place is just amazing. The cataplana was filled with heaps of chunky seafood cooked to perfection in a tomato based broth and the Mediterranean octopus was one large delicious piece of grilled octopus. 

The servers were also extremely knowledgeable and attentive. They would come back periodically and ask if anything was needed. I like also how they remove the bread crumbs from your table.

The problem when our group of five went was the fact that they were having some big gathering upstairs and so the kitchen was awfully busy - not slow as you could see a lot of food going upstairs just way too busy and our food took over an hour to come and that was for lunch! To their credit even though the kitchen must have been going on overdrive, all the food came out consistently good.

Will definitely try again because I think that the slow service which we received was an anomaly given the food and server quality and the large amount of food coming out of the kitchen."}
{"text":"I have been a guest at Adega on numerous occasions and everytime I return, I am more impressed.
Both myself and my boyfriend have diary and gluten intolerances and we were accommodated without even the blink of an eye. Our server was friendly, helpful and very familiar with the menu. I had the risotto and my boyfriend had the lobster feature - both made allergen-free!
I look forward to dining at this wonderful restaurant again."}
{"text":"One of your best choices for a relatively fancy dinner near College and University. Excellent seafood and great Portuguese wine! Excellent service."}
{"text":"Attentive service and amazing food from the appetizers to dessert. Resevations were made and after being seated we we're given a sample amuse bouche of octopus. Throughout our dinner our server came back to check in at the right interval, refill our glasses and also reccommended and told us the specials. A great first experience at Adega. I will be visting here again for sure."}
{"text":"Would probably give it 3.5 stars if I had that option. Some things were excellent while others were mediocre. 

Our table of 4 shared the seafood platter which had shrimp, octopus, calamari, herring and smoked salmon. Everything on the plate was delicious including the grilled vegetables and grilled pineapple (yum). Highly recommend this platter! 

For our main my husband and I shared the grouper (which was a special of the day) and the seared scallops. The scallops were listed under salad but came with some sort of tomato puree and just a few little greens around the plate. I felt the scallops were well-cooked but was surprised by lack of green. The grouper was a little overcooked and not very tasty. For a place that prides itself on its seafood and as a seafood lover I was very disappointed. I know other yelpers have had good experience so maybe it was because we chose a filet over a whole fish. We are not big fans of picking out the bones. 

Lastly, we had the lychee creme brulee with mango sorbet based on yelp recommendations and it was delicious! the combinations of flavors were excellent. 

Service was good and the server helped us pick out a nice red wine to go with dinner. Meal came to $130 for 2 which wasn't bad for what we ordered. 

Overall, I would go back but would stick to the seafood (shrimp, calamari, octopus) instead of the fish. And definitely get the dessert!"}
{"text":"Fresh seafood at reasonable prices. The whole fish was excellent. Seems to be a good place for family gatherings...not really a romantic date spot."}
{"text":"my husband chose to take the pre-fix which was one of tow choices of :starter,main,dessert and hot drink. He chose a grilled calamari,linguini with tiger shrimp was bad because the taste of barbecue sauce was overwhelming and for dessert white chocolate cream caramel was nice, all of  it was 35$, seams reasonable compared  to what I had :fish of the day which was grilled sea-pas with lemon and garlic loved it but it was alone around 35$!!"}
{"text":"The waiters and service were truly amazing classy, very nice!! The food very good I ordered the lobster over risotto, I was expecting more meat in the lobster but my experience over all was quite lovely!!!"}
{"text":"Visited Adega for the first time this week.

With seafood offerings in every section of the menu (minus dessert, duh) seafood foodies will not be disappointed.

I went with the Cataplana, a traditional Portuguese seafood stew served in a copper clam shell. I'm not well versed in Portuguese cuisine but it was delicious.

Flavourful and brimming with mussels, salmon and squid this dish could easily have been split between two diners but it was so so tasty I had no problems gobbling the whole thing. The pictures really don't do it justice. 

Fellow diners orders the whole sea bream and octopus and I look forward to trying both upon my next visit.

Because yes, there will be a next time."}
{"text":"Excellent place for fine dining in a cozy atmosphere. We were wlcomed with courtesy, waiter was very friendly and described the menu with clarity; drink orders taken and delivered without delay. Menu had dishes to suit all tastes. The seafood and fish dishes are what brought us in and they did not disappoint; calamari done to a turn, tasty sardines, rich risotto and stunning fish stew. Service polite and efficient. Interesting wines by the glass at very reasonable pries. The only negative was parking experience, but it was expected on Sat night at downtown."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd visit. Happy with both times. Food is delicious and service is always great. Reservation is better., my  recommendations ."}
{"text":"The staff is super attentive, helpful and polite. Making our anniversary dinner even more pleasant and memorable. The seafood risotto was great but the tapas selection was rather limited. However, it's a restaurant that worth visit! Will come back again!"}
{"text":"What a great meal! Trekked across the GTA for dinner with friends after a serious snowfall. We showed up an hour late for our reservation because of the weather and the host staff were so welcoming. 

We enjoyed the garden and goat cheese salads first, and followed this with a saffron seafood risotto, shrimp linguine and a seafood stew. All delicious! We left the restaurant smacking our lips with a promise to return soon.

I do recommend a visit!"}
{"text":"3/5! We heard amazing reviews about this place but we weren't that impressed. The biggest problem was that the chef was out of a lot of ingredients so 30% of the menu was not available (most of which we would have selected). We encountered a similar issue with the wine list. Of the 3 dishes we ordered, the only remarkable one was the grilled octupus. The fish stew arrived cold and the chicken risotto wasn't that great (granted we should have ordered the seafood one instead). Overall, unlikely that we will go back."}
{"text":"Tasty food, wonderful little eatery with fantastically fast and very friendly staff! Well worth trying for a dinner if you're nearby."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place.   It isnt often that i slow down just so the meal lasts longer. This time i did.  I had the seafood  risoto.  It was wonderful.  It was packed with seafood - no skimping.  Everything blended into a wonderful  sauce that gathered in the bottom of the bowl - mmm just wonderful!  My companion had the fish stew; which hd really liked."}
{"text":"Great place with a great wine selection of Portugal.


The menu selection was grreat
The only little minus :) ?
You cannot make a Lychees Cr√®me Brulee because od the eggs.  It was a great Cr√®me Brulee just couldn't taste the lychees."}
{"text":"One of the better places on Elm Street, 2 blocks south of College Street TTC Station. Service is crisp. Food quality excellent. Has small alcoves for an intimate dining experience."}
{"text":"4.5 stars.

I've eaten here a couple of times, and always had a great experience.  The service is quick, polite, and helpful.   The food is well-prepared and well-presented.  They have a private dining room in the wine cellar which some friends and I used once, and it's very cozy. The main dining room isn't overly large, and has a nice atmosphere.  

On my most recent visit I shared a pistachio-crusted goat cheese salad, and had lamb chops (a special).  The lamb was well-cooked (I asked for medium and got medium, which is bizarrely not that common) and well-seasoned with rosemary and ?????... don't know what else, but it was tasty!

 A can't miss place for a nice dinner out."}
{"text":"Adega is one of our favourites.  This is the resturant where I proposed to my future wife.  They were very accomodating for this event and were happy to provide me with a private alcove table.  They were very good with their timing and nice enough to provide us with a couple of glasses of complimentary champage a well timed minutes after the main event.

The wine list provides a nice selection of lesser known portugese varietals and our server was exceptionally knowledgeable about the characteristics of each.

Our meal started with some excellent bread and some extremely addictive olives which are probably some of the best that I've ever had.

We had the Petisco Platter for our appetizer.  Everything was excellent, especially the portuguese cheese, perfectly grilled sardines and chorico.  

My Fiancee had the Mediterranean Octopus which was exceptionally tender and cooked to perfection.  I had the Cataplana Fish fish stew which was an excellent, traditional comfort food.

Our night was finished off with some tasty desserts.  I had a glass of vintage white port which complimented the White Chocolate Creme Brulee rather nicely.  My fiancee had the Warm Caramelized Apple Tart with an espresso.  

Overall a fantastic evening with an excellent atmosphere, great food and exceptional service."}
{"text":"If you want fresh and perfectly cooked seafood with great service, then this is the place. The sardines, the fish of the day (sea bream) and the Cataplana were all delicious."}
{"text":"I ordered the whole fish and my boyfriend ordered the lobster, the part I don't like is that they only use half the lobster and use some tiger shrimps to substitute the other half, why not make a whole lobster? For the price you charge, that's the least you can do.

The food taste ok, but if you have been to restaurants in yorkville, then you won't have any surprises here. The fish is overcooked and they burned the best part of the fish, the fish skin, so it tasted bitter, and no sauce for the fish, which makes it dry. 

But the fish is still much better than the lobster. My boy doesn't like his lobster, he gets spoiled by good restaurants already. lol.

The bill came out around 120 dollars, we didn't order any drinks but order some appetizers and some desserts. They have good bread spread, i think they made their own spread, tasted like minced fish. But the bread is not good. 

I don't think it's worth the bill. But it's at a very good location, so take that into consideration, I think it's somehow understandable."}
{"text":"Quality: 8/10
Service: 9/10
Portion size: 5/10
Environment: 8/10

Great place for a date, their Lychee Creme Brulee was really impressive and I usually don't get impressed by fancy desserts. Their seafood looks good but we had pasta and a steak dish. As a guy that can eat a ton, not exactly filled up like I would at Grazies. Still, great place overall, would go again."}
{"text":"I always wanted to try one of the restaurant on elm street. The appertizer plater was awesome...love the octopus! For entree,I had the fish with scallop..it was quite enjoyable. I thought the fish was a bit salty but the scallop was spectacular. For dessert, I had the lychee creme br√ªl√©e with mango sorbet. It was delightful.

Overall, it's a nice dining experience."}
{"text":"I attempted to go here three times and on the third try I finally got to eat here. I really enjoyed the food and my experience here. I had the Cataplana as well as the grilled sardines as an appetizer. The sardines were good, but nothing spectacular. There were a lot of little bones, which was fine with me, that got stuck in my friend's throat. The Cataplana was really good. I enjoy Boullabaise a lot and so I was really excited to try the similar dish and was very happy with my decision. The soup was fresh and I liked that it was a tad spicy. My friend also got the risotto, I believe it was the saffron risotto, which was also very well done. After my bad experience with risotto previously, I stopped eating it, but I would definitely get it again here. For dessert, my friend and I shared the dark chocolate mousse, and it was delicious. We both love dark chocolate and we were glad we opted to get this dessert out of the many other temptations. Overall, the food was good and the service was impeccable. Water was always filled and the servers were attentive without being intrusive. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Just came back from dinner with a friend. We both had prix-fixe menu (appetizer, main and desert). I had grilled squid (apptizer), salmon with vegetables (main), and creme caramel (dessert). I am not sure which I should praise more of--the service or the food. For $40, I say it is worth it. Nothing was overly salty or greasy (very common these days). Squid was really good but for me the best part was the kale that came with my salmon--cooked to perfect texture and the dressing on it was amazing. Salmon also had good slightly crispy outside. Once again the service was really great as well and I am willing to try different items on the menu next time. Overall, I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is a Portuguese restaurant located on Elm, between Bay and Yonge Sts. in Toronto.  Although they do offer roasted meats, it does seem that their specialty is seafood.  We enjoyed two of the evening's specials - half lobster with seared scallops, and grilled monk fish.    We started with the goat cheese and pear salad, and also enjoyed the fresh bread and marinated olives that came with dinner.  Cappuccino, along with cherry-and-pistachio biscotti and a caramelized apple tort with Tahitian vanilla bean ice cream finished off the meal.  

Service was very professional and attentive.  The wine list was plentiful, but I asked for assistance with a selection that would be comparable to an Albarino.  A mid-range option was suggested (meaning they didn't try to sell me the most expensive wine on the menu).  It was a great choice that complemented our meal.  Overall, we had a great dinner and experience."}
{"text":"Disappointing Summerlicious experience indeed.
Firat the good: the decor is attractive and even though the restaurant was crowded the noise level was acceptable so you could hear each other at the table.
 On to the meal :
We both had the so-called snow crab cakes...which should rightly be called potato croquettes with specks of crab...totally unremarkable and false advertising to boot.
For mains we had the pan-fried Dorada  filet and the risotto with shrimp and baby clams.  Both just OK but I wouldn't order either of these again.  The Dorada filet was a small portion barely 4 ounces and somewhat overcooked but the smoked paprika concasse with it was good. 
The risotto had no sign of baby clams.  When we questioned the waiter he said clams wouldn't be included with a Summerlicious dish but when we insisted that the menu specified clams he relented and said he would check.  This is really crappy service from a waiter.  So he came back to explain that they're small baby clams.  We would say they were more like fetuses not babies so hard it was to see clams!  We found exactly 2 pieces of baby clams so again a false description of the dish.
Dessert was a trio of good sorbets and also a trio of pastries which were good and probably the best part of the meal.
Definitely would not recommend this place based on this experience especially given this is supposed to be a high end restaurant."}
{"text":"Awesome food with awesome service. Enough said. 
Seafood, spaghetti well cooked and tasty. Bread is exotic and yummy.
Waiter is always smiling and courteous."}
{"text":"My wife and I took my daughter for her 19th birthday to Adega. It had been a while since we last had dinner there. This place is a real treasure. Probably one of the best and most affordable quality Portuguese food in Toronto. The Cataplana ( fish stew) is exquisite, so is the grilled octopus and free range chicken. All appetizers are great. Wine selection even though is mainly Portuguese's wines is very balanced. You can order any of their reds and won't be disappointed.

I strongly recommend Adega to anyone who likes Mediterranean food, a cozy environment, down to earth service and affordable prices."}
{"text":"If you are looking for classic Portuguese seafood, professional service and a perfect dining experience in Toronto ... look no further!

Adega has been consistently fabulous and I've been eating there for over a decade. Their service is warm, attentive and welcoming whether I am dining with one friend or many.

The ambience is quiet - no loud music and/or screaming children/patrons - and relaxed. The food is beautifully presented and delicious. 

All dinners begin with olives and a basket of breads (oh how I love the Portuguese corn bread) and olive oil. There is always an amuse bouche served with the chef's compliments. The menu is EXHAUSTIVE and there are always \"specials\" (4 or 5). The portions are HUGE and I am sure no one has ever left without being stuffed and very happy.

Adega is my go-to restaurant for birthdays and impresses all my out of town friends. The dining room is very comfortable and there is a \"party\" room downstairs if you would like to host a large party."}
{"text":"Summerlicious Review - Summerlicious menu was okay. There are better restaurants out there than this one. 

Service 
The service was good we were seated right away to our table and the waiter refill our water every time.

Food 
AVOID getting the Seafood Bisque with Dungeness Crab Aioli. The previous review about this dish is true. It is not that great. Also the fact that I had a fly in my aioli just ruin the dish itself. Our waiter even stated the fly wasn't there in the beginning. Of course you didn't see it only when you eat the dish half way you can see a bug floating in your dish. I receive no apologies from the waiter but was only offer another Aioli. The only good thing out of the meal was the dessert which was the sorbet. 

Like the the previous review from Kathleen W., \"If you are planning on doing a horrible job or can't source good ingredients to work for the Winterlicious pricing, don't bother participating in because it's just going to tarnish your brand.\"

This is my last time coming here. I should of read the bad reviews on google and yelp."}
{"text":"Adega is an impressive spot with quite decent seafood and other Portuguese specialties.  However, I think the combination of really good service and a super convenient downtown core location cause it to get a bit of ratings inflation.  I was quite surprised to see it listed as the # 1 Toronto restaurant overall in TripAdvisor.  Frankly, I don't even think it's the # 1 Portuguese seafood spot in TO.  

The food was pretty universally tasty and well prepared; the cataplana was top notch filled with high quality bits of fishy goodness, the prawns were tasty and properly cooked and seasoned beautifully.  The only dish that let me down was the octopus.  Not that it was at all bad, it's just that I had recently been able to consume some of this most delectable cephalopod at both Joso's and Chiado and they have set the bar ridiculously high for the Toronto scene. 

Adega seems to be a pretty regular tour stop for Mws2 (Men Who Still Wear Suits) so if you're allergic, best to steer clear.  The regular bookings of drug reps, investment bankers, and other assorted rogues do put quite a drain on the service in the place.  Eating hear when large groups are being accommodated is sure to rev the frustration engines well past the red line.  

Bottom line; you'll eat well at Adega and, quite surprisingly for the location, you'll do so at a fair price.  There's quite a lot to like about this restaurant, just not all that much to love."}

When my friend took me to now my favorite place for pasta, Donatello (check out my review here), I saw couple restaurants along the Elm street that I wanted to check out later. Adega was one of them so I decided to drop by for lunch one day. Many of the restaurants on Elm street looks a little fancy and to be honest, I walked into Adega thinking it was Italian.

Once I walked into Adega, I was surprised by how much bigger the restaurant is once you are inside. The restaurant was pretty empty, except 3~4 tables with business men in their suits (most of them in their late 30s to mid 40s). Interior of Adega gives you this warm feeling with the dimmed lights and wooden interior.

Ordered: SEAFOOD BISQUE 4/5
*Seafood bisque with dungeness crab aioli for $6.95
*For the price you pay, I thought this was very good
*Soup is creamy and bursting with seafood flavor
*It's very smooth and you can really taste the crab aioli

Ordered: SHRIMP LINGUINI 3.5/5
*Linguini with Tiger Shrimp in chipotle pepper and fresh basil tomato sauce for $18.95
*This was decent lunch portion with lots of shrimp
*Pasta was kind of overcooked which was unfortunate cause the sauce was really good
*Sauce was tomato based and it had just the right amount of sourness and sweetness to it
*I really liked the consistency of the tomato sauce cause some places make it too runny
*Sauce was perfect to dip the bread in

Ordered: GRILLED SQUID 3/5
*Grilled squid with lemon, coriander & garlic with olive oil sauce for $19.95
*I've been obsessed with grilled calamaries lately
*But it was my first time ordering it as a main dish
*This is big in portion, maybe a little too much of just the grilled calamari
*Calamari was very fresh but it was just a tad bit undercooked and a little too soft
*Olive oil sauce was suppose to accentuate the freshness of the squid but i found it to be a little bland
*Served with potatoes, bok choy, green beans, carrots and beets
*Don't understand why they would use Bok Choy for non asian dishes
*Potatoes and the carrots were cooked perfectly but I wish this came with rice or something

Summary: Overall, the food was decent and I was satisfied with the service. However, I don't have any thoughts on going back to this place. Why? I guess nothing really stood out to me and made it memorable. Or maybe I didn't see anything on the menu I wanted to try the next time I go back. But if I do go back, I don't think I would be back for lunch. Adega would be better place to go for dinner or if you are going on a date so keep that in mind!"}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday and must say nothing we extra special. The portion sizes were ok, the service was ok. My bf called ahead to have my name written out on the plate of the dessert for when it came...and they completely forgot! They brought out the dessert and once we were done they brought out the plate. Strange. They verbally apologized, but really nothing else."}
{"text":"Came here last night with my wife for our anniversary
Based on reviews I wasn't disappointed. ..reviews are true...as soon..as we walked in interior is very rustic and warm and intimate ....we felt very cozy...great for a romantic dinner...slow music playing in the background ...great atmosphere. ..service was top notch. ..every waiter was attentive to our needs and never felt rushed...menu was good decent prices mostly sea food...we opted...for price fix menu...36 course was delicious my wife had the pan smeared salmon which she loved...I had tiger shrimp with linguine such a amazing...meal...for dessert we had creme bulee. ..and they brought us anniversary dessert was a good surprise ...will definitely come again...if you want to come for a special occasion or a date. .you won't be disappointed ...I think we found a gem...in downtown...portion sizes we good.

{"text":"Food was great! The shrimp linguine and seafood stew had so much flavor! Place was cozy with staff that was brush your table crumbs attentive. 

Recommended, will definitely return."}
{"text":"Had a birthday dinner with ten friends here recently.  Everyone raved about the food from start to finish.  Our server was friendly and accommodating and offered good suggestions whenever we asked.  The port room is a nice venue for a private party - just keep in mind that it's a wine cellar so a tad on the cool side!"}
{"text":"I was quite surprised by my visit to Adega.
We had a reservation for 8:15 but showed up around 7:30 and they told us our table was waiting for us. Their tables are quite distant from each other, so you can actually listen to what your friends are saying 5 stars so far!
After we made our order we got bread and olives, which is typical for Portuguese restaurants I guess. I don't go to too many, so I'm not an expert. Bread was okay, but kind of generic. 3 stars for that
Food was another matter. We ordered the appetizer platter and some shrimp on the side. Everything was really good, and tasty. Their portions aren't even small, cause I felt  I was getting full by the time we finished the appetizers.
For main dish we all tried something different - seafood and meat. If you go there go for the seafood! My duck breast was tasty, but the portion felt small. My meal was the smallest of all. I didn't leave hungry so it didn't bother me.
Overall, I'd say food is really delicious, but not so imaginative. I felt like you can have some of the dishes at other places. 4* here
Desert: I ordered the creme caramel and everyone tried it. Everyone got wowed by it! I haven't tried creme caramel in a long time, but it was definitely what you should order if you ever visit 5* on that
Service: attentive and polite. Not much else to say. I have no remarks! The waiter was a really nice guy. This could be considered both good and bad, but I felt we had to wait too long to get our main dishes. I didn't care cause we were already having a good time, but for someone who's in a hurry it might be a problem 4.5 stars on service

Tried the Portuguese beer which was nice, but expensive. 

To sum it up, while the place might not be exactly 5 stars if I have to be more objective. My score reflects my overall experience from dining in there.

Would I go back again? On a good occasion for sure.
This place should also be perfect for a more quiet and romantic dinner!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and food. Loved it here. The shrimp bisque and the chocolate mousse were fantastic. The Portuguese wine light and refreshing. The service was beyond attentive, friendly and respectful. Really, really nice."}
{"text":"I think I just had a bad experience here because everyone really seems to like the place. Maybe it was an off day for the chef.

My husband and I went with another couple here for dinner and we tried the Cataplana, Seafood Saffron Risotto and Fettuccine with Scallops and Smoked Bacon. All these dishes were good but nothing really blew my mind, not the way I expected after having read the reviews. My friend and I had the Risotto, although I finished mine she didn't. I liked the Risotto but I feel it lacked enough saffron.  The Fettuccine was really good though. The Cataplana my husband tried and said was ok-good. 

We did have a really nice white wine though, the name of which I forgot but they have a good list.

I think I would like to give this place another chance since so many people love it. I find it hard to believe we didn't like it as much.

PS: The quantity of food they served was really good."}
{"text":"The essence: A warm inviting atmosphere and interesting Portuguese cuisine options.

The food: While the food was pleasant, it wasn't special.  

The experience: The service was slightly glitchy all evening.  The acoustics and seating somehow made it hard to hear my wife, but everything said at the neighboring table was clear as a bell. 

The summary verdict: I'd have no problem eating here with you if you wanted to give it a try, but I'd probably be a bit more excited to explore other options before coming back."}
{"text":"I had just sat down to another group dinner at Adega and I begin to think about the big events that occur in the upstairs when I see the drug reps who frequent the upstairs events coming out.  
Yes, this place can host a crowd. They might just survive on money from Abbott and Pfizer etc.. But my group meals for 10-14 people have always been easily accommodated any night of the week. They don't make large groups order off a set menu, so you can get what you really like. 
Only thing I've seen that didn't look delicious here was the risotto.  Is it true that the risotto mix-ins are yesterday's leftovers?  
My most recent visit, I had a craving for grilled calamari. Done. 
In the winter months, the seafood stew can't be beat. 
Polenta is a bit brick-like, not soft and creamy the way many people like it. 
Portuguese food with a bit of Italy sneaking in, is how I would describe it, but most Portuguese places are cheap chicken joints, so this is high class. 

I adore the bread baskets and olives that are given to every table. ADORE the bread! Specials are varied and often include some type of whole fish, which I ordered once.  Lobster can be taken out of the shell for you- hello- amazing!
Wine list is basic, but well-prices for above group dinners."}
{"text":"Pleasant, food was ok - octopus dish didn't taste particularly fresh - even though it was their \"special\".  I think there are many other better restaurants in Toronto to consider."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place. Actually went here for my birthday lunch since my team at work let me choose where to go.

When we went, there was no AC in the restaurant. It was so hot - we were sweating.

FOOD:
1. Shrimp Bisque - with dungeness crab aoili

This was really good bisque. The soup really had the thick shrimp flavour and there was a lump of dungeness crab that goes well when you mix it with the soup.

2. Seafood Saffron Risotto - with mussels, shrimp, squid and fresh fish

Everything about it was really good! The seafood were all fresh and cooked perfectly. The rice was cooked with the seafood \"broth\" so it has a delicious seafood taste to it.

I'm very torn with this dish because I find it to be in between a paella and risotto - like it's sort of unsure about it's identity lol. And I personally love paella and risotto already so having this \"in between\" dish makes me wish it wasn't in between.

3. Cataplana (Portugese Fish Stew) - bouillabaisse of mussels, shrimps, clams, squid and fresh fish in a tomato broth

My friend, who's a seafood person, had this and she said it was so-so and unremarkable. I didn't try it so I can't really comment.

4. Birthday Dessert - some sort of chocolate cake

It was good, but nothing special. It was too rich in chocolate such that it might be too much for one person to finish.


OVERALL:
I had so much hope as it was very promising to hear about a highly rated Portugese Restaurant in Toronto. It was very underwhelming. It's not really something I'd be excited to go back for."}
{"text":"I was curious to try Adega after all the positive reviews here on Yelp. 

I came with a reservation (a good idea because the restaurant is small and cozy).  The wait staff was very attentive and polite. We were brought complimentary amuse bouches, which were puff pastries with chicken liver pate.

I ordered one of the specials of the day, which was lobster with seared scallops on a tomato risotto.  The risotto and lobster were delicious. The scallops were slightly bitter (probably were charred too much). 

Although the price points are higher, the food is definitely high in quality and preparation. The portions are relatively generous as well, since many at my table were too full to finish their meals!

Overall, I recommend this place for a dinner with a smaller group of people who enjoy seafood dishes."}
{"text":"Hey dude - where's my food?:) 
My husband and I walked in on a Wednesday evening around 7pm and the place wasn't crowded at all. We decided to sit inside as it was too windy outside. (Note: they definitely need to re-uphoslter their banquette)
The waiter forgot to mention the specials to us and had an air like 'what do you know?'. The food took forever to come and after a long day at work - I was super tired. The chorico was ok - nothing to write home about. My SO ordered fish stew and I ordered rissotto. The fish stew was great ( I have had the same in Alfama in NYC and in Lisbon) and this was comparable. The rissotto cried out for seasoning and, tbh I have had better. 
Bottomline - if you live next door go have the fish stew (big enough to share). If you don't - go to Chiado (not been to it yet). If you miss this one - you really haven't missed much."}
{"text":"Adega is one of my favorite restaurants in Toronto now.  The service is impeccable - thanks Joe!  The restaurant inside is intimate and they play wonderful Portuguese music (I have a big beef with restaurants that play the top 40 when they should be playing music from where their menu hails. i.e. Sushi = Japanese music.  Italian, Italian music...you get my drift.  I once was at a Sushi restaurant and they were playing The Best of Bread - if you haven't heard the album, go Google it, and you will feel my pain - I digress...) I had the Pistachio Crusted Goat Cheese Salad.  It was amazing.  Thinly sliced beets layered with pears and arugula topped with a large piece of goat cheese - remarkable, and perfect for a hot summer night.  My main was the Fresh Fish Stew.  The presentation was AWESOME in a bronze dome with a hinged lid.  Wonderful.  It was spectacularly delicious and loaded with fresh seafood.  The bread was fresh and the wine was perfect.   What a delight.  It is an excellent choice for anyone staying at the Delta Chelsea.  Good for dinner meetings, first date, romantic evening.  The patio upstairs is serene.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurant in the city with 5* @ food @ service. My to go place for any reason."}
{"text":"One of the best 5 meals of my life.  Fantastic!  I had the grilled octopus.  The mango sorbet is the best I've had.  Service was impeccable.

Thank you thank you thank you."}
{"text":"What a great date spot. The food here is really clean, fresh and delicious. The wine selection is nice, and when asked, the waiter did not recommend the most expensive thing on the menu, which always makes me trust the staff a little more. Obviously one should expect that in higher quality restaurants, but it's becoming an increasingly rare thing that waitstaff are concerned more with experience than sales. The olives are a bit confusing when they first arrive at your table, but they go so well with the flavours on your plate that you understand when your main course arrives. This was an excellent experience and we will be back. The atmosphere is casual to dressy, and the tables are traditionally set. The crowd is older, we were the youngest."}
{"text":"Overpriced. It simply wasn't that good. 

We also had the unfortunate experience of a very impatient waiter."}
{"text":"This is a fuddy-duddy place that has been here forever, yet, still serves good food. 

The waiters are very seasoned, they've seen it all. They provide a good explanation of the menu. They are attentive and solicitous.

The wine list is predominantly Portuguese, and there are some excellent value wines on it - for example the Vino Verde.

We had an amuse bouche of octopus, which like the bread was complimentary.

The sardines were small, crisp, with peppers and pineapple and acceptable. They did not seem like fresh sardines in any way.
The monkfish was plenty to share, soft and full of flavour, the lentils and asparagus that accompanied it were good - the lentils with a slight curry flavour and the asparagus peeled and crunchy.
The lamb chops were big, and perfectly cooked. The fries that accompanied them were authentic and fine.

The biscotti were small, fruity and nice.

Overall, we had a good but not exciting meal."}
{"text":"It was 9 p.m., I was meeting up for a dinner and the place we ended up was not what we thought. I have been dying to try Adega, and was a short cab ride away, so I called and said - got room ? they said, if you can get here before 9:30.

This is how magic happens - by accident.

Once inside - decor was cozy beautiful. 

Food was excellent. Appz - the scallops were absolutely delicious. Soft on the inside, hot, and a thin crust on the outside.
Seafood soup was crazy amazing good - surprising.
 the shrimp linguine was meh. I asked for a white sauce instead of the red sauce - but they said white sauce was possible - but it had bacon bits in it. Oh well. I am only taking off one star because the linguine was kinda dryish.

Had a bottle of what they consider their house white. - good.

Service was fantastic. Server very knowledgeable.

$125.00 dinner - worth it.   - I rarely say that.

I will come back here, maybe take my parents for dinner. This place is beautiful."}
{"text":"Second year in a row here:  I give it full ratings not because I liked the particular type of food overall (more fishy seafood, whole fish, big jiggly squid parts, etc) but for the originality of the menu and the unique experience it offers.  Well decorated, impeccable service with (at least ours) Portuguese waiters.  Fancy yet not totally killer on the wallet.  Of course being a queasy fish guy I ordered the steak: it was huge!   Servings generous.  For desert I think I had the most bitter thing ever created: espresso with a nasty bitter strong alcohol (forgot the name) which I managed to gag down....all part of the experience."}
{"text":"Not going over the top here but Adega will forever be the most memorable meal I had in Toronto.  

Food
Firstly, their Portugese cuisine was incredible.  Their signature Cataplana (seafood stew) was loaded with mussels, shrimp, clams, fish, and veggies.  Also, they serve their fish whole.  No square fillets of mystery; we are talking about fins, head, tail and all, as nature intended it.  Lastly, rack of lamb, and in short, ucculent, juicy, and tender.  

Service
Extraordinarily attentive staff.  We didn't have to ask for anything.  Refills came when needed, food came out hot and together.  What was extra nice?  The check didn't come till we asked for it.  We stayed there for over 2 hours"}
{"text":"Great Spanish Style food in Toronto, Canada, We were there on a business trip and hotel bartender suggested us this place.  It turns out wonderful."}
{"text":"Great Portuguese seafood place right in downtown Toronto.  I've been there three or four times by now.  They do great grilled sardines which is so hard to find.  Good grilled squid too.  Great seafood stew.  Great grilled octupus.

And a good selection of wines.  I am not that familiar with Portuguese white varietals so I trusted the waiters to choose good pairings with my seafood dishes.  I had the saffron poached pear and it was great.  Very elegant and tastey."}
{"text":"The food was good, atmosphere relaxing and fantastic attentive servers. What not to like?? :)"}
{"text":"The food and service at this place are both great. We had the grilled squid appetizer, which was cooked perfectly and delicious. I had their signature grilled octopus with a caper tomato salsa, which I thoroughly enjoyed. My GF had the seafood rissoto, which comes with mussels, shrimp, squid, and chunks of whitefish. 

Prices are reasonable for the quality of the food. Highly recommended and I'll likely be back next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful experience recently. For starters I had the grilled octopus and roast pork belly. The octopus was perfectly done and the pork just melted. For my main I had the seafood risotto. It was extremely flavorful. My wife had the trout, which was quite good too. All the dishes were well plated. We were too full for dessert! Would we come here again? You bet!"}
{"text":"Winterlicious 2016 was my first foray into Portuguese food since I am planning on visiting the country this summer. I don't know exactly how authentic the cuisine is, but I do know that I had a great experience. Nice places like this usually cheap out on the serving proportions during Winterlicious (looking at you Canoe) but I was not disappointed here!

For my appetizer I ordered the grilled squid. Delicious and beautifully presented on my plate! Servers were super attentive and kept our bread basket full. For the mains, I ordered the mushroom risotto and my husband ordered the seafood risotto so at least I got to try both. I actually very much preferred the mushroom risotto... it was so flavourful! Everything was served piping hot fresh too. The mains filled us up quite nicely too but I made sure to finish my dessert, which was a sample of three kinds of cake ;)

Fancy but not too uptight atmosphere and great service. We were greeted warmly when we arrived and were bid farewell in such a gentlemanly manner (he remembered which one was my coat). It was such a nice restaurant experience, I'd recommend this place to anyone and hopefully one day I will return!"}
{"text":"I read the reviews on this restaurant and had high hopes. I was disappointed. We ordered quite a few dishes and I don't know that any one of them were too exciting. The guys liked the sausage. The seafood stew was average. The grouper was average. The fetuccini was good. How weird for that to be at a Portuguese restaurant?!?

Will not come back here."}
{"text":"Dinner here last night when Adega was crowded with academic conventioneers. Service was a bit slow in consequence, but the food and wine were very good. Shrimp, salmon, risotto all had large and tasty portions, nicely plated. A fine dinner in all respects."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favourite Portuguese restaurants in the city hands down!

Amazing food reasonable prices!

I usually get the seafood risotto which never disappoints! Great customer service and amazing food every single time!

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Nothing stood out.

Had the fish stew, it was good but didn't blow my mind or anything. Broth was tomato-based and didn't have much flare. Fish was soft and cooked well though.
Also had a white fish with polenta. Fish was cooked really well, but again, the overall impression was meh. 
Lobster bisque wasn't good. Service was decent. Staff were very accommodating. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I went there valentines day weekend (the15th). My boyfriend had made reservations at least a month prior and had asked me to call to confirm. They had booked us for March, this was extremely disappointing but after a good 5+ minutes on hold they fixed the situation and that was that. 

We went in and asked if they had a booth (i read the reviews and remember someone mentioning how nice it was) he told me they were really busy this weekend and didn't have one, but assured me he had a really nice table for us. This table was by the washroom entrance, very nice indeed :). 


Besides that little annoyance, we ordered. I have recently changed my diet (no meats) so their enormous choices of seafood was really appealing. Quite a few options. I had ordered a fish dish which was a special (not on their menu, forget the name, sorry) and my bf ordered theira shrimp linguini (but with their cream sauce instead of the tomato based). 

The food was delicious. Extremely delicious. The scallops were seared on the outside and so juicy on the inside. The only downfall of the dish was the potato that accompanied it, it had a really awkwardly crunchy/tough exterior. But delicious once I got to the centre. 

My bf enjoyed his linguini, but he enjoys anything so not much to say about that. 


DESSERT. My fave part of any meal. We got the creme caramel. SO GOOD. Had no idea what it was. Went on a limb ordering it and it was SO DAMN GOOD. I still think about it sometimes. 

All in all great experience, waiter was great, refreshed our bread and topped our water often. Received a bruschetta bite \"compliments of the chef\" at the beginning. Great touch. Will return one day!"}
{"text":"It's a good restaurant but I was hoping for more Portuguese dishes. I had the Mediterranean Octopus, which was very well made. The espresso con cheirinho is a nice way to close the meal."}
{"text":"My third time at this very unassuming little restaurant on a side street that can easily be missed. Please do not miss it - fresh seafood, the grilled octopus is just outstanding. Great selection of Portuguese wines. Had a 2014 Vale from the Duoro region, great wine at great price $52 Canadian, I seem to recall."}
{"text":"3.5 star...we did some minor yelpsearch before heading over to this place for my burpday dinner...so I had expectations coming in...maybe that's just not the right approach....?

So we ended up ordering calamari, octopus, seafood risotto, We pretty much ordered alot from the Yelp recommendations except for the catch of the day....cuz I wasn't attracted to sea bream...the service was pretty good as they checked up on us quite frequently...olives and bread was refilled promptly... 

Nothing really Wow'd me in general... everything was a balance 3.5 star well deserved...the.seafood risotto was filled with seafood but the ratio of risotto rice was not there.. it just felt more like a seafood only dish.. not risotto... 

We ordered one prix fixe as one of the guest wanted to try it so we gave it a shot...agree with Jennifer K.  that it wasn't good at all.. you can tell the difference in taste and in plating... 

Prix fixe is probably made by the sous chef or something....

All in all,  it's an A-ok place...."}
{"text":"I was here with a friend for Monday dinner. The service was excellent from beginning to end. Based on the long list of specials the waiter had to spew out, I was impressed (and slightly amused) with his memorization skills.

We both had the Butternut Squash soup (soup of the day), it was delicious. I had Pan-Seared Chicken Breast and my friend had the Chicken Risotto with Spinach/Sun-dried Tomatoes. Although I am not big on chicken, I really enjoyed it. For dessert, I ordered the Lychee Creme Br√ªl√©e based on a previous Yelp recommendation, they were not wrong, it is awesome!

We were there for quite a long time but our waiter still served us water even after we paid our bill. The only negative thing I have to say is there was a lot of time between our Soup and Main Course being served but it was ok because we were distracted by conversation anyways. Service great, food great, no complaints, will definitely return."}
{"text":"I came here with some co-workers for a good-bye lunch. 

We were immediately greeted when we arrived and asked if we would like our coats taken. We were brought to our table and seated at a cozy booth which was perfect for our intimate occasion. Our waiter described the specials to us, and then was kind enough to say that he didn't want to rush us, but that he also had two large parties that had just arrived, so that we could get our orders in before these groups. I really appreciated that he took the time to tell us this!

All table members enjoyed their dishes. I ordered the grilled calamari (lunch size, not appetizer). It came with lots of calamari that was cooked well, although some pieces were slightly overcooked (not uncommon when grilling calamari) and drizzled with olive oil and garlic. It also came with polenta, asparagus, green beans, carrots, and roasted beets. The beets were delicious! My only complaint was that there was a bit too much olive oil on the calamari and the vegetables for my liking, but otherwise it was a great dish!

Throughout our meal we had superb service that had an air of quiet elegance, not the pompous over-the-top flair that you sometimes experience at higher end restaurants. The waitstaff were attentive without being in your face."}
{"text":"Great service all around. Had the salmon and it was cooked to perfection. Also had the squid for appetizer and it was also excellent."}
{"text":"Probably the best Portugese food I've had in Toronto. Got the seafood saffron risotto and it reminded me of Portugal so much. Seafood is fresh & tasty and staff are warm and welcoming."}
{"text":"Winterlicious Review - Don't bother with the Winterlicious lunch menu, not worth the money or time.

My friend and I were excited to try Adega and figured we'd stop by for Winterlicious. Worst decision ever.

SERVICE
I arrived early and was seated relatively quickly but I had to wait for my friend. The waiter kept coming by to the table and asked if my friend arrived. I told him she will be here in 15 minutes (ie: the actual time of the booking) and that we'd need some time before ordering. My friend sat down, barely had a sip of water or even time to look at the menu and the waiter was looming over our shoulders trying to see what we would like to order. No walkthrough of the menu or recommendations when I asked what he would suggest off the Winterlicious menu. 

FOOD
I've never been so upset to want to send food back to the kitchen. Sloppy presentation and bland food. I even mentioned it to the waiter. We were both starving and upset after the lunch.

We got:
Seafood Bisque with Dungeness Crab Aioli [flavourless, watery, lukewarm]
Beef Carpaccio with Spicy St. Jorge Cheese [the best dish we had]

Linguine with Tiger Shrimp in a Chipotle Pepper Tomato Sauce [4-5 pieces of shrimp, slightly undercooked linguine - didn't finish the dish]
Mushroom Risotto with Porcini-Truffle Butter & Parmesan (vegetarian) [smelled great but tasted like mushy porridge, and I felt like they added water cause it was not silky or creamy. Flavourless and sloppy presentation - didn't finish the dish]

Trio of Seasonal Tarts [couldn't care less about the dessert, dry tarts so it was really difficult to chew]
Mixed Sorbet (vegetarian)

I really hope this was just an one off experience because I've heard nothing but wonderful comments about this restaurant. If you are planning on doing a horrible job or can't source good ingredients to work for the Winterlicious pricing, don't bother participating in because it's just going to tarnish your brand."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic experience. On one of the busiest nights of the year, Valentine's day, I was blown away by the experience. My reservations was made a month in advance, and thank goodness for that!
We were seated at one of their private booths which was beautiful, well decked out and offered a nice intimate experience.
Wine was selected quickly from their extensive wine list, after which we went on with our seafood orders. We were also offered bread with olives and olive oil, and the waiter brought in an amuse bouche compliments of the chef.
The grilled calamari was cooked perfectly and had great presentation. She ordered the jumbo shrimp with piri pier sauce-spectacular!
I have a personal favourite-seafood saffron risotto for the great mixture of seafood-scallops, shrimp, fish, mussels, calamari etc. It was served a bit too hot however (minor critique..I know), but I prefer things served with the perfect eating temperature.

We were given enough privacy, and were taken care of quite well. Could not have asked for a better experience and will be back again!"}
{"text":"Perfect! No complaints! Food was fantastic!!! Walked in at the last minute. Service was wonderful, food was perfect! Loved that it didn't seem touristy!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. The prices are definitely fair given the area. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Delicious!

We asked if our party of 4 could be seated towards the back so that we could be nice and cozy. They provided us with a lovely circular booth which was private and old-world-chic.

What we ate:
- Apps: 
Piri piri shrimp (4/5) The shrimp were fresh and the sauce was delicate but perfect.
- Mains:
Grain fed chicken (4/5) Delicious and juicy
Mediteranean grilled octupus with caper tomato salsa (5/5) I WANT MORE
2x Catch of the day (5/5) This white fish (scrapper?) was meaty, flaky and perfectly seasoned.

A bit of an older crowed, but a great place for a family seafood dinner.

We were all so satisfied that we didn't even get dessert!

Love love love"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food! I had the prix fixe salad, squid, then biscotti. For each course the presentation was cute and creative. Also, the squid was perhaps the best tasting squid I've ever had. I did not have a dessert (other than the generous serving of biscotti) but the desserts I saw on my neighbours plates looked especially elaborate and decadent. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Summerlicious Lunch 2016

Booked a day off to take a friend from out of town to this place for the Summerlicious lunch. Read many promising reviews and had been looking forward to it since last week, but was met with disappointment.

Started off with some crispy crab cakes that was only jammed with mashed potatoes. It was nice, perhaps the tastiest out of everything on that menu. Only drawback was that there were absolutely no crab meat; only potatoes. 

Thinking the first dish was a hit-or-miss, maybe the main would be better? Nope! But let's start with the positives first. The waiters were very attentive and polite, so that earned a star. Mushroom risotto came out piping hot. Smell of mushrooms and herbs were aromatically mouth-watering. Expecting the first bite to be al dente; discovered under-cooked arborio rice instead. Could literally feel the uncooked grains lodged into my molars and had to rinse with water a couple of times to dislodge the hard centres. Would also like to add that the menu mentioned \"truffle butter\" but there was no truffle flavour at all. Ended up finishing all the mushrooms instead and left the rice--so wasteful. There were very few people at 11:50am, so quite sure why the quality of the food was sub-par.

For dessert, the caramel flan is highly recommended for people with a sweet tooth. The fruit acidity of the strawberry (coulis?) complimented nicely with the creamy texture of the vanilla custard. Thought it worked really well on a white chocolate base. But alas found it was too sweet and only half was consumed.

This restaurant had a lot of potential and was my first Portuguese restaurant in Toronto, so my expectations were similar to that from previous experience in the Azores. $23 + tax + tip was not too bad but probably won't come back.

Feedback: Please please please ensure the risotto is thoroughly cooked through for future customers."}
{"text":"The food was great but the service was slow. We will definitely return once more to try it again. If the service is better, I can see this place becoming a regular spot."}
{"text":"I had lunch at Adega last week for a co-worker's retirement party, and we ate downstairs in the private dining room. 

Decor: The dining room is your typical wine cellar - bottles upon bottles lining the walls, crates, and an actual little cellar which added an interesting dimension to the room.

Ambience: Upscale, perhaps a bit of an older crowd, but pleasant enough.

Service: Waiter was incredibly knowledgeable about the different wines and pairing them with our meals, as well as being very patient with our large party. We had a few \"difficult\" guests making their own requests and comments, but he handled them gracefully and patiently.

Meal: I had the seasonal baby green salad with a champagne shallot vinaigrette for starters, and it was incredible. The dressing was tangy, fresh, and the dish was plated beautifully. I had the pan roasted breast of capon with a mushroom herb sauce, mashed potatoes, and market vegetables for my main course. I would've liked a bit more of the vegetables rather than the few string beans I got, but the breast was huge and there was a hefty amount of mashed potatoes. The sauce was very flavourful, and there was a generous amount of it too. The dessert was a bite-sized trio of a cheesecake, pecan caramel square, and a custard-type square. Not a big dessert fan, but these were the perfect size for a post-meal sweetness and I cleared all three.

Cons: While I really liked everything that i had, i'm not sure anything really blew me away in terms of flavour or uniqueness. I'd be open to returning and trying some different dishes for a more authentic Portuguese flavour."}
{"text":"PRO: Very nice decor. We get to seated in the wine room it was quiet and great to have a conversation with everyone.

CON: The bartender doesn't know his drinks. I requested a \"Tom Collins\" and they served it to me in a whiskey glass!?

COD fish was bland and tasteless"}
{"text":"Came here yesterday to try the Prix Fixe menu, and it way surpassed me expectations. Portions were huge (we had to pack a lot of go, salmon steaks could have fed two), and food was excellent quality, with everything being perfectly cooked.

Service was great, our server was attentive and helpful with great recommendations, and my water was always filled (which matters a lot to me because it's awkward to keep asking). He spoke with a charming accent and even offered us more bread when ours ran out (as I am a bread monster when the bread is good). There were olives (YUM) on the table as well, and olive oil for the bread. 

I had the squid (perfectly cooked and two big pieces, with beautifully seasoning, over a pineapple and ?cabbage? salad for brightness), the salmon (beautifully crusted and perfectly cooked to be meaty and not mealy, with a tangy complimentary pineapple compote, and perfectly season veggies below). The sorbet was very good, but a lot of sweet for one person to handle. We also got personal teas as part of the menu. 

Also at the table, was the ceasar salad, which had lots of prosciutto, the chicken and the seafood stew were all delicious as well! What really took the cake was the DARK CHOCOLATE MOUSE CAKE! ORDER THIS!!! It is not on the prix fixe menu, but it was delicious! 

I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out tonight w the Parental Unit. 

Classy and chic, I got a good vibe upon entering this establishment. Service is very professional. Our server, a gentleman directly from Portugal, was great. He entertained my father's desire to talk about the country. Surprisingly, the pricing here is very, very reasonable. 

I made reservations on-line ... quick and easy. 

Their wine list is extensive with bottles from Portugal. My Portugalphile parents were in heaven drinking wine here as it reminded them of their numerous trips to Portugal. 

As a starter, we ordered the mixed greens and grilled squid. The squid with coriander and grilled veggies was delish. For mains, the mother ordered Adega's shiitake and oyster risotto. The father and I ordered the herb crusted salmon. I had a bite or two of the risotto so I can confidently say that both mains were delish. 

This place is a 'must go' if you're a fan of seafood. 

Yay, I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Came for Valentine's Day and although we were 40mims late we weren't given any hassle about it and the service was amazing. Enjoyed every dish we had and although a little on the pricey side, everything was really well made and had no complaints. Would definitely come back here again and try their different menu options AND the lychee creme br√ªl√©e was to die for!"}
{"text":"I live super close to Adega but never knew about it until it was researched on a list as a romantic restaurant to go to! We came here for our anniversary and was pleasantly seated at one of the booths which offered a bit more privacy. The restaurant has good ambiance and has a more rustic feel to it. There was bread, olives and a small spoon dish to start (honestly, I don't remember what it was). We order the grilled squid to start and it was cooked perfectly and seasoned nicely. For the mains, we opted for the scallop & bacon fettucine along with the special of the day - rack of lamb with mashed potatoes. As a pasta lover, the fettucine was cooked al dente and seemed to be fresh pasta. There was a good amount of scallops and bits of bacon. As for the lamb, it was cooked medium rare as we had requested. it had a nicely seasoned crust and my boyfriend said the mashed potatoes were delish! For dessert, we opted for another speical of the day - creme br√ªl√©e with oreo! It was really good as the oreo wasn't overdone and complimented the creme br√ªl√©e very well. I also wanted to give shout to all the waiters that served us as they were very helpful and good at what they do. I loved my experience here and thought the value of our dinner here was amazing. Only complaint was that the food came a bit slower than I expected but overall, I'm a fan (:"}
{"text":"Usually, for my first night in Toronto, I do something fast-foodish: small-time Chinese, for example, or a falafel platter someplace. This time, I was in the mood for a sit-down dinner so I could relax. I checked out the restaurants on Elm Street, and ended up choosing Adega, not least because it offered a $40 prix-fixe.

The atmosphere is lovely: wood and brown-toned stucco, lit by what could have been track lights, had they been on a track. My opener was the \"Romaine hearts\" -- basically, a small Caesar salad with dried prosciutto, which was good. My entree was the pan-roasted salmon; the serving looked small, atop a bed of vegetables with two roast-potato halves, but was just the right size; the salmon was excellent. Finally, dessert and coffee: I chose the mixed-fruit sorbet, one scoop each of orange and strawberry, atop a few fruits; and first-class, strong brewed decaf. The service was attentive throughout the meal, despite the presence of several larger parties in the place; and the waiter gave me something like three coffee refills.

It was lovely, and absolutely worth the money -- which wasn't as much as I thought; at the current exchange rate, it came out to about USD 32 with tip!

Strongly recommended!"}
{"text":"This was my second time here, the first was a few years ago. This time we came here with a party of 4 (my wife and her parents), 2 were celebrating birthdays. We had reservations for 5pm but got here a couple minutes after 4:50 but because they open exactly at 5 we weren't allowed in and had to wait outside in the zub zero temperatures, while I saw the staff just standing around talking. After walking to Yonge St and standing on the corner looking at all the restaurants for a minute or two, now in retrospect we should've just gone to one of those, we walked back to Adega and were thankfully allowed to enter out of the cold.

They originally wanted to seat us at a booth but because one member of our group is claustrophobic we asked for a table instead. I could've sworn I mentioned this when I made the reservation but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and say maybe I didn't. The waiter said they were fully booked but he'd go check. He came back in a minute and seated us at a table. Funny thing was, by the time we were leaving there was only 2 tables that were only recently taken - one had literally just walked in.

We started with a couple shareable platters. Then went on to order one prix fixe, the fish stew, and two specials which that night was sea bass, and one dessert in addition to the one that comes with the prix fixe. The portions were decent, but we didn't feel it was anything special. I was also a little disappointed that no effort was made for the birthdays like at so many other restaurants we chose in the past. It's not hard or unusual to have a dessert comped, or even stick a candle in the dessert we ordered just to make the customer feel special. Especially considering what we were paying (ordered wine & drinks in addition to the food). It wasn't a cheap dinner.

Overall I think the experience has diminished from my first time. At least the waiter was friendly, but other than that there was nothing special about it - nothing that would make me care to go back. Honestly, we could've had the same experience in a food court. I should've seen the pattern of low ratings from the recent reviews. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Nice spot for date night, not too stuffy not trendy good service good food and not insanely loud like some restos can get when crowded. 

Reasonable prices for what you get I think our bill was about $100 per person for three courses plus glass of wine. 

We had pork belly/octopus app (very good but a bit of an odd combo). 

For mains we got the Cataplana and the seafood risotto. Both dishes were not lacking for seafood. They were very generous with the servings. Did not skimp as i noticed there were three big clams (not the baby clams you often get).  Seafood risotto was good but not great. 

Waiter was helpful and explained the dishes as well as the wine.  

Dessert was also good mango crime brulee and chocolate mousse. 

Solid choice."}
{"text":"This restaurant has showed me how to love sea food...

I've never been a big fan of seafood till I went to Adega and tried out their octopus and bouillabaisse... OH MY GOD!

Amazing!

I've been there three times since and will keep going there anytime I have the urge for seafood.  

Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Considering how I ate every morsel and even ordered dessert despite being full, I've considered and am bumping them up to 5 stars.

If I'm in Toronto again, I will definitely stop by and dine again!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed by Adega. 

Especially for seafood. Definately has authentic flavour and did remind me of spain. 

I've been told from a regular that the lunch specials are usually really good (most other restaurants use specials as a way to get rid of produce, but apparently Adega does not). 

All in all, the atmosphere, the service, the food, the price point, all delivered high value. Will definately make this place part of my regular listing of places to go to."}
{"text":"It's really 2.5 ... It was not bad but really heavy and salty and nothing special we got oceana platter and I got grilled octopus nothing special and octopus was over salted .... We tried 4 deserts ; white  chocolate cream caramel , mango thing and a tart thing and lint chocolate thing and again nothing supper special but  white chocolate and mango thing was good"}
{"text":"Great fresh fish!! Very light seasoning to bring out the natural taste of the fish.  The grill sardines were delicious as well."}
{"text":"It was our first time to Adega and we loved it. The ambience and decor is nice. The service was excellent and the food was fantastic. 
We had the grilled squid and crispy pork belly as an appetizer along with the Portuguese seafood stew and seafood risotto as our main courses.  The seafood were all cooked perfectly, nothing over or under cooked. 
95% of the time, we never order dessert but the lychee creme br√ªl√©e was something we couldn't pass up. It was delicious! Not too sweet and the hint of lychee made it unique. 
The prices are very reasonable considering the food is delicious. 
We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This place is always busy! Since I live very close by I have been here about three times in the past four years and they never fail to disappoint. This particular time I went here for lunch on a Thursday with a girlfriend and we both had babies (4 month and 1 month). They were busy but they gave us a table in a semi private area and were very patient with us. It took us an hour to settle down and actually place our order and not once did we feel rushed or that we were a nuisance. The restaurant is fairly small so strollers won't fit here but we had two car seats and it worked out perfectly. 

The black olives here are divine! I go here just for them! Luckily the rest of the food is also amazing. This particular visit I had the chorizo potato soup of the day and the gravlux along with the apple pie and dark chocolate soufle. All dishes were fantastic, great complex flavours with Portuguese flair. 

If you're ever looking for a baby friendly spot that isn't a chain restaurant this is it! Their wine list is sufficient and has some excellent finds. Mains on average were about $16 for lunch. Dessert was around $7 each and appetizers range from $7 to $15."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I came here for our annual Christmas lunch. I had a hard time finding a spot that could accommodate a party of 12 and Adega had no problem slotting us in for a date two weeks before Christmas.

Most of our party arrived on time but we had a few stragglers. After waiting about 20 minutes, we were urged to go ahead and order as they had other parties coming in (or something, no one ever came in and no one was waiting to be seated when we left, so I didn't quite understand that). 

I had the goat cheese and beet salad to start, which was absolutely wonderful. Honestly, such a refreshing, beautifully balanced salad. It was heavenly to eat! For lunch, I went with their daily pasta, which was a chipotle shrimp pasta that sounded delicious. Unfortunately, it arrived at the table looking less than appetizing. The sauce it was tossed in was a icky brown color and the shrimp just looked like they'd been thrown in. A little sprinkle of parsley or some kind of garnish would have taken that dish a long way. Otherwise, it was just a huge lump of brown pasta that really didn't make me want to eat it. It was quite spicy and I couldn't finish the dish. I regretted not going for the mushroom risotto as I'd originally planned, my coworkers who ate it were raving about it. 

For dessert, I ended up getting the white chocolate creme caramel... and I about died it was so good. Everyone who got a dessert was impressed and this dessert in particular was sinfully good. 

All in all, a good meal. I was disappointed with my main, which should have been the star of the show, but an okay experience. I really wish we hadn't had pressure put on us to order, I would have preferred to wait for our straggling coworkers to arrive so they could peruse the menu a bit before ordering. There was no need to rush us out, there were no other patrons waiting to be seated and the restaurant was fairly quiet by the time we left. Adega is a favourite for work lunches where I work, but I think I'll explore other options next year."}
{"text":"We loved Adega! The service, ambience and delish food makes it 5 stars and confidence that we will be back. Great work Chef! I hope the quality of the place will stay the same forever."}
{"text":"A wonderful experience on a Friday night. Came here with two friends for a late birthday dinner. We got greeted, got offered to hang our coats, and seated immediately upon arrival. Upon being seated, our waiter offered us sparkling or iced water, described to us the roughly half dozen specials for the evening, and told us to take our time. He refilled our water, checked up on us throughout the evening, and never rushed us to get out the door, even after paying.

We started off with complimentary bread and olives, as well as an amuse bouche (which was salmon tartare that night iirc). My two friends ordered off the prix fixe menu while I had a seafood saffron risotto and a creme brulee. The pan-seared salmon and the pieces of fish in the risotto were moist and delicious, and so was everything else. The portions were nice and there was lots of seafood in the risotto. The creme brulee was yummy but the cookie dough that came with it was so-so, it could have used a scope of sorbet.

I will be back!"}
{"text":"In one word: wow! 

Exceptional food, drinks, service and decor. 

Excellent and fresh specials, risotto was perfectly cooked, dessert was decadent, drinks were excellent the service was wonderful and attentive."}
{"text":"Thanks to my partner for bringing us here to celebrate my birthday a few weeks ago. We had a great time here. The service here was top notch - he was friendly and professional. For appetizer we shared shrimp bisque ($9) - delicious and well made. For main, I ordered the seafood risotto ($26) - well flavoured. One comment would be that the salmon was a little dry though. My partner ordered this daily fresh fish dish (forgot the name and price) - it was great though. My favourite was the Dark Lindt Chocolate Mousse Cake ($8.95). 

Overall, we really enjoyed our experience here. :)"}
{"text":"Adega is simply superb, and a dying breed of restaurant in Toronto.  Upscale with great food, and great service.  All without being pretentious.  I've been here several times, and each experience has been equally great."}
{"text":"A favourite in the hospital district of Toronto, this place is reliable and good.  A mix of classic Portuguese food and Portuguese-Italian pasta and steak, the service is always friendly.  Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"I am not really a big meat eater and when I saw Adega Restaurant's menu online promising Portuguese Style Seafood and Prix Fixe every evening, I am IN!

Making the reservations online was easy using Opentable and a table for 2 was secured with no problem.

Prix Fixe Menu ($33.95)
- Seasonal Baby Greens Salad
- Pan-seared Atlantic Salmon
- White Chocolate Creme Carmel

They were all OK, but didn't wow me.... 

I sweet talked my Yelp Drinking Buddy to order something else off the menu instead of going with the Prix Fixe and that ended up to be the best choice of the dinner.

Grilled Whole Fist ($30)
- My Yelp Drinking Buddy to this day still talks about how good the fish is!
- Lightly seasoned and grilled till the skin was crispy and the fish is still moist and tender.. 
- I witnessed that evening how one can eat a fish until every single part that can be eaten was consumed... even the fish eyes!!!!

Adega is a great restaurant to come for dinner if you are into seafood, as you won't be disappointed. But skip the Prix Fixe and go for the real deal!!"}
{"text":"In Toronto on business and went for dinner by myself.  No bar to sit at, which was a disappointment.  Restaurant is very nice inside and wait staff was good.

I had the Pistachio Goat Cheese Salad and the Cataplan.

The Salad was very good with a generous amount of goat cheese.  I hate when restaurants put a tiny bit on the salad.  Not so here!

The cataplan was ok.  There was plenty of fish, Salmon and another type, clams, mussels, and squid.  My complaints on the dish are two fold.  First it was so freaking hot that I couldn't touch it for 10 minutes.  Even then I had to blow on the food before I ate it.  Secondly, there is a lot of broth which goes to waste.  I would prefer to have some rice with the dish, or even better have the rice cooked in the stew to make a sort of payaya (I know that I killed the spelling on that).  I think it would be a more satisfying dish of there was a way to get the great broth flavors integrated into some rice."}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic, guys!
Even the appetizer portion was big enough for a lunch!
Don't miss the door)"}
{"text":"Elm Street has a slightly touristy feel and Adega is no exception. But the menu, wine list, and service would definitely bring me back. The house salad was fresh and bursting with flavor, the rack of lamb was done to perfection, and the Spanish wines were perfectly balanced with the meal."}
{"text":"I was here for summerlicious with a bunch of coworkers months ago and had a great experience. So when I was part of the committee to plan our work winter social - Adega was at the top of the list. It was walking distance from our office, had great food and service. And - the most important criteria - had a room that could seat 50-60 people!

Our staff party was held upstairs in a their private room and bar. The space had sound equipment, a private washroom, and coat rack. In the summer - there's a balcony too.

From scouting the location to booking; confirming reservations and the day-of event - everything went without a hitch. Manny and his staff were very helpful, and their assistance throughout was appreciated.

We had 3-course pre-fixe and each person had their choice of appetizer and mains. All the meals were prepared at time of order - so the food came out pipping hot and fresh!  But that also means there was a bit of a wait for each course to be served, but we were warned ahead of time about this - so we planned team activities throughout to keep people entertained/busy.

We did decorate the space with more festive items - nothing was allowed to stick to the walls, but we had table decorations that worked.

Overall, everyone enjoyed the event - which is a tough feat to please 50+ people! So if you're looking for a venue for a company party, I'd recommend Adega."}
{"text":"Walked in and immediately loved the atmosphere where it's quiet and classy but not overdone. We were greeted by a friendly gentleman and restaurant was 1/3 full on a Tuesday evening. The server was very nice. I had the scallop and bacon pasta and I liked that the portion wasn't ridiculously huge but not small either and the pasta seemed to be freshly made in house. It was flavourful but not overpowering. Only wish was there were more bacon in the dish. My friend orders the dark Lindt chocolate mousse for dessert and I tried a few bites and it was to die for. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I came here the other day with a couple girlfriends spontaneously for a friends birthday. It was a Tuesday evening and the restaurant was relatively quiet. 

Service was amaaaazing!! As soon as they sat us down they brought us a bread basket and a plate of olives, which they kept replenishing!

They then brought us these cute little taster spoons of octopus salad from the chef. They were amazing!

We split some salads for apps that were all delicious. For my main I got the grilled squid. the portion was huge and it came with a ton of different veggies  that all tasted great.

Our servers were attentive throughout.

I would 100% return"}
{"text":"Another hidden treasure in elm street, really love the atmosphere  of this restaurant, food is extremely delicious made from scratch full of love and passion the service is top notch simply amazing  experience !! Highly recommend this amazing place !! Please try the caldeirada !!"}
{"text":"Why I gave 4 stars
Service 5 stars: The staff were extremely attentive and ensured that everything was taken care of. The restaurant has great architecture and I think it is a good place to celebrate a special moment.

Food    3 stars:  I loved the sorbert dessert, delicious. However, my pan seared salmon would have had perfect if it was not for the excessive salt. Looking at the previous reviews it seems that this is a recurring problem. Hopefully the chef at Adega find alternative ways to add flavour to the food without relying on salt."}
