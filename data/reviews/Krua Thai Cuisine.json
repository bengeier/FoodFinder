{"text":"Had a very good experience.   Ordered 2 appetizers and 1 main course.   Every thing was served hot and tasty.  Will definitely return to try a curry dish.  Price was very reasonable."}
{"text":"Food is Ok, but servers and staff are very abrupt and new restaurant is uncomfortable in its arrangement...seating is cramped, uncomfortable and very close to the next dining party....we spent lunch hearing about someone's medical colon issues....grossssssss"}
{"text":"Kria Thai is like being on a boat in the faaaa east. Seriously it's a delicious neighborhood Thai joint that hits it out. So much better than the chains that are everywhere. The yellow curry is how I judge a lot of hai places and it's awesome here!"}
{"text":"Great foood. Great service. Great lunch specials got more than i expected. excellent flavor. Mom and pop literally work together. fantastic . Thai hot is really hot they dont expect people to order it they are surprised when people do but i like hot. and its hot but awesome. Great job keep it up!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite Thai restaurant.  Best Thai food in the valley. Staff is beyond amazing and down to earth. We have been visiting this place once a week for a year!!"}
{"text":"Wow we found our new Thai place and who knew it would be a quick drive from our place.  It would be worth a long drive regardless.  We ordered beef garlic lovers dish and green duck curry, wonton soup.  For desert coconut ice cream and Thai custard with sticky rice.  Everything was very delicious, service was awesome.  We love this place."}
{"text":"They must have changed their cook again.  We have gone to this place for the last 10 years but skipped for a couple years because the food was bland. Went back at the beginning of the year and it was good, but just went recently, and pad thai and yellow curry were not flavorful at all.  I would love to support this local restaurant though but it's been a little inconsistent.  Now Touch of Thai pad thai is awesome and the Thai House is better, more flavor."}
{"text":"The best Thai food restaurant. Phad Thai and all curries are awesome. Should try if you are in Phoenix area and looking for best Thai food restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Great prices for lunch. Friendly staff. The resturant has a kid friendly atmoshpere. Glad to have a good thai resturant in north Phoenix."}
{"text":"Placed a pick up order from this restaurant.  If you're dining in, you should realize that the restaurant is clean (and organized), the staff is friendly, but I wouldn't say that it reflects a \"fine dining\" ambiance.  However, the food was excellent.
 
I order Thai basil chicken and the flavors really blended well.  The chicken has absorbed the spices and the \"heat\" level was perfect for a \"spicy medium.\"  Also order the drunken noodles and enjoyed both dishes immensely.

I'm definitely plan on going back and taking the rest of the family to enjoy their cuisine."}
{"text":"I've had the Pad Thai here twice, to go. Very reasonably priced and some of the best in the Valley. Their spring rolls are tasty too."}
{"text":"100/10 --highly recommend! It was just $11 for the lunch special including soup, spring roll, curry, rice, & iced tea. They got the level of spiciness just right (extra hot) and great vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Love this place. I would eat here everyday if my waistline would allow :)"}
{"text":"Since my first review we have eaten here for dinner and had takeout.  Both were great experiences.  My wife had Pad Thai with chicken the first time and with shrimp the second time.  She definitely prefers the shrimp Pad Thai.  I had two fish dishes, the first was the spicy fish (number 63) and the second was a spicy fish curry (number 44).  Both were great.  I had both dishes \"Thai hot\" but could have had them even more spicy.

Yet this has got to be the best Thai restaurant in the Northeast valley."}
{"text":"I've eaten lunch here 6-7 times in the past year and dinner once. The lunch is an incredible value! For $7.95 you get a crispy, light spring roll, a clear, flavorful cup of vegetable broth, fragrant rice, and a generous entree. The more than 15 lunch entrees range from the typical red, green, panang, curries to cashew chicken, stir-fries and the like. On my most recent visit I tried the Pad Noh Mai, based on my server's enthusiastic recommendation. She raved about the delicious house special sauce, and I was not disappointed. 

We've tried several Thai places in north and west Phoenix, and we keep coming back to Krua Thai based on the food and the prices. 

Only one caveat:  the mild is spicy enough to make your eyes water and your nose run, so if you don't like spice - tell your server \"no spice.\""}
{"text":"Best Thai place in Phoenix or west valley. I've been to all the others. Great for lunch or dinner. Cheap. Tasty. Spicy"}
{"text":"The service we received made it difficult to enjoy the food. First the waitress literally grabbed the sugar packets out of my 14 month old daughters hand and told me she needed to \"throw them all away\" because some had dropped on the floor. Then, she told me not to get up until she had swept the small amount of rice that had fallen in the floor. Finally, she suggested that my daughter would be more comfortable outside of the restaurant. I have been to countless restaurants with my daughter including white linen tablecloth restaurants and I have never experienced treatment like this before."}
{"text":"The best Thai food I have ever had is here! Amazing service. Be kind to the workers here, they work hard. Great for carry out, great dine-in."}
{"text":"Wow,  delicious!  Went with a client that travels all over the United States for business and eats at some of the best places.  He said the freshness here rivals anywhere he's been,  east/west coast  and NY. 

I have been eating here for a few years and never write a review and he encouraged me to so here it is: 
1. Simple and charming place,  very clean!
2. Foods real Thai, I have a Thai friend that agrees
3. Food made in house fresh &  delicious
4. Sauces,  spring rolls,  tofu & satay aptzrs are amaxingly yummy
4. Family owned & no chain will ever match them

DON'T MISS THIS REALLY SPECIAL PLACE :)"}
{"text":"Amazing, if you are looking to taste Thai food at it's finest come to Krua Thai Cuisine. The curry's here are out of this world, with spice levels for all tolerance levels. Very personable, friendly service, easy to grab a lunch on a 1/2 hour lunch break. Highly recommend.. Yellow curry is my personal favorite!"}
{"text":"They have the best red curry ever!!! The flavor is amazing. The lunch menu is excellent. My favorite curry in town!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It is my go to option when dinner is my choice. Delicious summer rolls and favorite dish sweet basil chicken. I have dined in and order take out. Both are quick and staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Our favorite local Thai restaurant! Best we have had in Phoenix! We love spicy and the hot is what we usually order. It doesnt disappoint on the spice! Our go to menu items are the Pad Thai, Green Curry, Tom Kha and Pineapple fried rice. The staff is very nice and the new location is updated and super clean.  There are several thai restaurants within 5 miles of us but this is our #1."}
{"text":"Love the Thai food here. A little small, but a hidden gem. Lunch hours are usually busy, but once you are seated the serving is quick and delicious."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai place in Phoenix and around. Its really authentic Thai. Krua thai rama and Green thai curry are my favorite here . The chicken satay is great too. We are a regular here and would recommend to everyone. Take care of what Spice level you ask for.5 is still above medium and works best for me as I'm an Indian. anything above that can be too much to handle."}
{"text":"Really amazing! I was having a major craving for pad thai and did not want pei wei or pink pepper again right now.. As I was getting tired of always going there. I tried Krua Thai's Pineapple Fried Rice and at first I was shocked by the price at 9.75 but there was plenty enough for the two of us to split and it was quite tasty I will always get it again when we go back. The Pad Thai was really good as well.  My partner and I both loved them and will eat them again."}
{"text":"We just loved it... a lot food... spicy upon request.. good service. . Ill go there again for sure.. loved there iced thai coffee.."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout and was happy with the service. Pad Thai, papaya salad and curry is good."}
{"text":"I found this place to be pretty mediocre. Four of us got take out from here and we had the pad se iew, pad thai, and stir-fried sweet basil. We also got sides of the steamed sticky rice. All were good, but nothing that I'd probably go back for, or really recommend as a good representation of \"great\" Thai food. All four of us could have used more heat on ours, and while we could have ordered the next level of heat, I'm not used to having to go all the way up and order the spiciest level at the first go - especially with Thai food which is known for its heat! I'm usually a mild person, but I'd definitely go medium, maybe even spicy/hot from here to get a little more flavor. My veggies were nice and crisp and my noodles not too soggy. Could have used a little more egg in the pad se iew, and much more flavor all around. As as the 2 stars suggests, it was A-OK. Not bad by any means, but would have loved more flavor."}
{"text":"Breathtaking, amazing, and beautiful are just some of the words to describe this place. There fried wontons are amazing with an Amazing sauce. I always have there yellow curry, and it is amazing. Prices are good and nice serving size for great leftovers. Potatoes could be a little thinner cut but still amazing. The yellow curry is very spicy but still worth it! You HAVE to come to this place! Extremely authentic with very nice service and a good interior (not great)."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy here, just a casual and inexpensive place to satisfy your taste for Thai.  The menu offers a large selection of authentic Thai dishes and if since they don't have a liquor license, you need yo BYOB.  The Larb is fantastic and the Summer Rolls are tasty. Fast service, inexpensive lunch, and good service.  Definitely one of the better Thai restaurants in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Too Good!
Had tried the Tom Kha Chicken soup (Hot) and Spicy Hot chicken fried rice..it was too goo!"}
{"text":"I have to update my review. I love this place and everyone I usually bring here loves it too. But the food is hit or miss, and I think it depends on which chef is there that day."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! My in-laws are here from Michigan and love their little Thai restaurant they go to frequently. However, they came here and now is their favorite!! (Along with mine) the satay chicken is always amazing and their veggies taste so amazing! I highly recommend anyone wanting to try Thai food to visit Krua."}
{"text":"A small Thai food joint with excellent ambience and very good inexpensive food. Must try if you like Thai."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! Me and my boyfriend try to come in about once a week. The food is amazing. We get the yellow curry and the chicken pad thai, YUM"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and want to pass on the good word...Great word actually, because Krua Thai is fantastic. Very authentic and well priced. Portion sizes are generous and the staff is very friendly. My new go-to for Thai in Phoenix. Nothing on the menu has disappointed so far."}
{"text":"Omg! Hole in the wall authentic Thai place that is amazing. We had to wait for a table which is usually a good sign! The service was more than perfect. Recommended a few appetizers - egg rolls and fish cakes and then we had pad Thai and panang curry. Both were some of the best we had. We will absolutely be back and not just for the food but for the warm and superb service! This place is a must if you are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I don't tend to look for Thai food in Phoenix, and I'm no Thai aficionado, but Krua really delivered. My wife and I tried it tonight after looking at Yelp reviews. We got the Panang Curry with chicken (ordered thai hot) and... Pad Prik King with beef (ordered very hot) Both were excellent, and when they say hot, they mean hot. My wife and I can both stand pretty hot/spicy food, and the \"thai hot\" level was really nice, and accumulated over time.

The Panang (yellow) curry was excellent and we both decided it would have been better had we not ordered it so hot but we had to try the hottest none the less. The Pad Prik King (red curry) was a nice complement to the hot yellow, and slightly sweet.

It's a very small restaurant and service was very nice. It might not be the most authentic Thai on the planet, but it was quite respectable and very well priced."}
{"text":"In my opinion, the best Thai food in Phoenix. The owner and his wife are super kind and hospitable. Service is quite quick, and I like the new location! Most importantly the food is phenomenal. The Panang Curry is especially to die for."}
{"text":"Really good Thai food and very nice people. The Tom kha soup bowl is enough for 5 and medium spice is just hot enough."}
{"text":"This is a staple in our house! Always fresh and delicious. We love their curry dishes and I personally love their soups. Most of the time you will see \"Mama Krua Thai\" cooking in the kitchen which is always good to see."}
{"text":"Excellent food,  great service, we come here every week,  can't resist the red curry,  we tried other Thai restaurants but always this one is the best,  we love our server Sam,  so polite and provides great service."}
{"text":"Have eaten here twice, the second time one because a friend wanted to go. The food has some strange flavors that don't seem to be similar to other Thai places. We had one entree that simply did not taste good, and so we asked for something else, they ended up charging us for both."}
{"text":"Been there with Friend6 nice food, thanks for suggestions correct spicy level,,Enjoyed a lot!!"}
{"text":"Great Thai food here. Small place with limited seating but there is usually always an open table. They are heavy on the spice so beware. If you order Thai hot be prepared to sweat. Portion sizes are large enough to share between two \"non-starving\" people. It's small and a little tucked away but definitely worth finding."}
{"text":"Great food...consistently. Go here with my lunch buddies and been served quick with some hot awesome food. Service is very friendly and helpful in case you are new to Thai but have the pallette for flavors and lastly very decently priced!!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food ever!!! The Tom yum soup is spicy and very tasty. Thai red curry is fabulous. And a absolute must is the sweet rice and champagne mangos. Don't let the unassuming \"hole-in-the-wall\" type exterior fool you. This is true authentic AMAZING thai food!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Some of the best curry we have had! So craveable & authentic !!"}
{"text":"Spectacular food and great people at a great price!  Kind of in a ghetto strip mall, but definitely worth the trip.  The food was excellent and the experience was fantastic.  You will definitely like it, but the \"thai hot\" was no joke!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Just went to the new location which was bright and airy. Still the best Thai in the valley. New servers made service a bit slower than usual...and a lot more takeout orders were being prepped when we were there than usual making our food come out slower but all still worth it as the food is fresh, hot, and delicious."}
{"text":"Fantastic. For years there were no really good Thai places in Phoenix. This is one of several now. The food is always fantastic, and has just the right amount of spice to it. It's always right at the level you order. I have a few favorites and they never disappoint. I'm glad to see them in a new, large space."}
{"text":"Amazing, authentic Thai food. Their spice scale is strong, so order less if you are not sure."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've been coming here for about 8 years now. The food is consistently great, the service is prompt and polite. The music isn't to loud which is nice if you want to have a conversation. Small space but comfortable; 8 booths with seating in the middle. It's not super fancy or upscale and they do not serve alcohol. I chose green curry with chicken for lunch it was under $8 it came with soup and and a egg roll. They have a great menu with a lot of variety.  Nom Nom Nom."}
{"text":"Really good food! The service was ok but by no means the worst. I will definitely return in the future."}
{"text":"Not too shabby!  If you are looking for some solid Pad Thai then enjoy yo self because this hit the spot.  The shrimp rolls were yummy and we will definitely hit this place up again when the Pad Thai craving hits.."}
{"text":"Did not even get a chance to step inside. It was closed looked at the sign to see the hours only to find a employee pointing at the sign that shows the times open with a smug look. Not impressed. Would have loved to try the food but employees don't seem very friendly."}
{"text":"The food here is soooo fricken good! I had the red curry pineapple shrimp and Thai tea with cream, and both were absolutely delicious. My husband had a cashew chicken dish which I sampled and it was fantastic as well. We will definitely be back to try more. Note they are super busy during the lunch hour, so if you go for your lunch break just know you are going to late back to work. Spicy levels are mild, medium, hot, and Thai hot."}
{"text":"This review comes at least six months after two visits; one in which I was disappointed and the second, with which I was seriously pissed.
   I can't reasonably dispute the positive reviews since I can't imagine anyone bothering to promote a place they don't actually like and yet, and not for the first time, my experiences here were worlds away from you more fortunate Yelpers. Yes, the service was fast and friendly but at a price I'm no longer willing to pay.
   Visit 1:   I picked the budget friendly option of a lunch special to go of beef w/ red curry. At home, sipping a bit of the curry, I was treated to a complimentary burst of flavors that were very palate friendly. I thought I'd gotten lucky (only food-wise, can we talk?) and would be able to chalk up a new go-to Thai place, but as I spooned the dish over the rice and forked my way through the meal I became increasingly aware of a mounting saltiness that became relentless in the end. I know that people share a varied tolerance for salt; some just a little and some can't get enough. I can happily crunch through a half bag of salt and vinegar chips so I'm not exactly a salt sissy. But obviously too much of it in an otherwise tasty concoction just makes it a mess not worth serving. That's my vote on this one.
   Plus, the egg roll was ridiculous. I didn't expect it crisp after the ride home but neither did I imagine the indestructable toughness I bit into. After a major effort to get the first bite down I realized that the dough wrap was at least twice the thickness of any roll I've EVER had and that I found so little filling of any kind that I had to check it out. Surgery STAT revealed contents of precisely two (2) bean sprouts and one (1) slender shred of cabbage. Period. That's it. In the trash. That was my budget lunch. Disappointing, but not bad enough to write them off just yet.
   Visit 2:   Thought I'd take a chance and order what I really wanted instead of another 'test' meal.
   In trying to recreate a truly great experience in the past from a place no longer around, I ordered Pineapple Curry With  Roasted Duck And Tomato from their list of 'Specialties' Sound good? Well, the curry WAS good; not too salty this time.
   But back home, I soon realized that my parachute had failed to open: picture no more than a dozen slivers of duck, each the size of two toothpics side by side and 3/4 as long. Maybe a quarter OUNCE of meat? Maybe not even..
   Envision similar sized bits of slimy skin floating around independently, indicating a minimum of four days in the pot, as did the rest of the ingredients.
Non-ripe tomatoes. In July. In Arizona.
   Add to this the fact that the kitchen (conspicuously) added what amounted to literally FIVE times the canned pineapple (why ever bother with fresh when you're just using it as a filler anyway?) that a dish this size can realistically support.
   So that was my 4 minute, 'from order to door', 'Specialty' from Krua for 'only' $15.25 inc. tax.
I'm absolutely certain they wouldn't have dared serving this 'bottom of the pot' debacle to a sit-down customer without  expecting to see it turned into 'instant wall art' but gambled that a  $15 take away probably wouldn't come back to call them out on this.
   I'm doing that here. No Mercy; and never again."}
{"text":"Krua Thai is a hole in the wall in a strip mall (go figure, in Phoenix?!), but don't let the humble exterior fool you.  Or the generic interior.

They serve consistently fresh and tasty Thai food at reasonable prices.  Service is excellent. 

I get the Pad Thai every time, as well as Panang Gai and Tom Kha Gai.  Never had the \"ramen noodle\" Pad Thai experience that one reviewer had. 

Great lunch specials!!"}
{"text":"Really solid Thai fare.  I am usually a huge fan of fried rice, which I didn't particularly enjoy here.  Nor their sticky rice dessert.  They were good/okay, but not memorable.  However, the pad thai and the yellow curry were stellar!!!  And they knocked the thai iced tea out of the park- yum!!!"}
{"text":"I have had the yellow and green chicken curry and both were delicious. I have had both dishes to go and they give a generous portion. The service is polite and fast and food is delicious.they are closed on sundays, thats the only bad thing i can say about this place so far. Will definitely go back for more and try their dishes."}
{"text":"Not bad, but not great either.  We ordered take out because it was 30 minutes before they were closing after lunch hour so I can't say much for service. I was excited because I've been craving Thai food since I left Houston and this would be my first place to try Thai in Phoenix. When we got home I was extremely confused because the yellow curry was practically red and really oily and the Pad Thai was the yellow I expected from the curry. (I'm used to a light brown color from the sauce and more flavors from the garnishes) Makes me wonder if it's a regional thing because every pad thai I've had in Houston was consistent in looks but this one looked extremely different. After confirming the dishes, the flavors weren't bad. My yellow curry was still spicy (but I'll contribute that to my ridiculously weak tolerance to spice or simple misunderstanding). The pad thai came out really sweet and I wish the other flavors were more prominent. As I mentioned the garnish were lacking. I would have loved that cilantro/bean sprout/lemongrass taste and there were no peanuts to give it that crunch. We also ordered the tom yum and felt no kick, but the flavor came out \"ok\" leaving the spice to be strongly desired (even for me)."}
{"text":"Very good and spicy Thai food! I ordered it medium and it had a serious kick. Dishes are about $9 which is reasonable, especially considering the portions."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in North Phoenix. I love spicy but if you go for the really hot level it'll knock your socks off. Definitely a must try"}
{"text":"Um, I don't know if this is the only place within a couple hundred miles to eat real Thai food, especially when they serve Chinese dishes like beef with broccoli, but it was a decent, casual place to have an inexpensive lunch. 

I ordered my curry \"Thai hot\" but got moderately spicy instead. Not a deal breaker since I had chili sauce on the table, but still... Siamese Kitchen definitely made their entree hotter. But heat aside, the food tasted fine, although it's hard to screw up any of the curries (if a restaurant does screw up a red/yellow/green curry, you should be a little more than concerned). 

While their menu isn't really all that extensive, the service was very friendly and efficient in the small, very casual establishment. Lunch consisting of entree, rice, spring roll, and soup for $6 isn't bad at all. Whether I'll repeatedly drive out this way to lunch here is another story, but I could see myself stopping by again if I find myself roaming up and down Bell for whatever reason.

3 Stars.

EDITED TO ADD: I am now having major lactose-induced issues, which took me by complete surprise. Did these folks put cream along with coconut milk in their curry? Not good...at least for the Lactaid crowd."}
{"text":"OMG amazing!!! This is the go to place for my weekly cheat meal! The egg rolls and chicken pad thai with extra veggies is my favorite meal ever!! They are very friendly every time anyone walks in the door and you get very fast service! Whenever friends and family want to eat thai with us, we go here (: The food ALWAYS tastes fresh and is very consistent."}
{"text":"Love the thai curry,I ask for mild it is still spicy but just right for me., love the service,Friendly and cheerful"}
{"text":"The food was awesome! And the service was excellent. The sweet n sour chicken with extra chicken  and yellow curry pineapple shrimp were perfect. I will eat here again and again and again!"}
{"text":"I'd recommend this place more for dinner than for lunch. Their lunch entrees, while generous, are really salty. Their dinner isn't over salted. They give you one small bowl of rice, and then charge $1.50 for more rice. It's always busy, but clean. It's smaller, so I wouldn't recommend having a dinner group larger than 5 show up without calling. I always get the eggplant stir fry. It's delicious, but it could use more eggplant. Also, the eggplant could be a lil bit more tender like at Touch of Thai."}
{"text":"Delicious. I went for lunch today and got the red curry with tofu, which came with soup and a small eggroll. They used fresh tofu, not deep fried, which was a new twist for me. It was delicious, fresh tofu cut with ridges so as to absorb more flavor from the curry sauce. I ordered it \"hot\" and that was plenty spicy for lunch! It made me sweat, and I have a fairly high tolerance. In any case, the place was nice, the food superb and service was friendly. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"My friends and I visited Krua Thai for dinner after being told how great it is. I've been eating quite a bit of Thai lately, but that would never stop me from trying out a new place!

It's a small place, so you may have to wait a bit during peak hours. It also leads to the staff needing to flip tables a little quicker once you've finished eating, but I didn't have a problem with that. I ordered my usual, Shrimp Pad Thai, but this time went with the \"Thai Spicy\" level of heat. The waiter laughed and said, \"Oh we had some hot spices this year, I almost died\"...coming from a thai guy I was pretty nervous. It came out hot and spicy as expected. The thai spicy level is sneaky hot, meaning it's not hot right off the bat with the first bite but gradually goes from stinging your lips to \"what the heck are you feeding me\" over the course of the dish. By the time I was done, I had a nice sweat on my cheeks and on my forehead. Our waiter joked again and said, \"oh you aren't sweating enough, here's some chili sauce for you\". Funny guy!

Overall, very enjoyable food, great selection and good price. All of us were happy with the food we ordered. The only down side was it was a little small, and got a bit loud from all the people in the restaurant. This would not deter me from going back, and I'm sure we'll be there again soon. I'd recommend Krua Thai to anyone looking for great Thai food with a small party."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and then much special was a great price for the food. The servers were really young and didn't provide very good customer service. I think a more tenured employee would probably understand the importance of customer service a little more"}
{"text":"Very friendly people and good service, I even left a tip. I ordered the red curry tofu extra spice and it was very delicious. I wish I did not order the extra spicy and just got the hot because I could not even eat all of it because it was so spicy. However, the flavors were still there so I got it to go. if I'm on this side of town again I would definitely go back. If you like spicy food, start with the mild and work your way up."}
{"text":"The food was extremely bland, and actually the worst Thai I've had here in Arizona.  Won ton weren't impressive.  The noodle soup tasted as if if consisted almost solely of (canned/boxed) chicken broth with no added spice or flavor.   Attempts to doctor it just made it too salty, so I am pretty sure it was an everyday high-sodium canned chicken broth, and not a boiled chicken stock.  Service was okay.  Parking is fine.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"BEST PLACE EVER!!!
My husband and I are regulars here for the past 3 years. We habe had everything on the menu. Lol seriously everything! 
We habe never been disappointed everything taste great appetizers, soups, entrees, EVERYTHING.  We have tried different Thai places and we always prefer it here.. on top of the amazing food CUTOMER SERVICE! OMG it's the best they are very attentive making sure everything is right. One more thing was my husband lost his glasses about 3 months ago which was the last time we came due to us having a baby, and today the owner came and told us we had forgotten them and returned them! That just topped it off for us WE LOVE THIS PLACE AND THE EMPLOYEES AND OWNERS ARE AMAZING SPECIALLY THE FOOD
I RECOMMEND THE COCONUT SOUP LOL AND THE SWEET THAI TEA 
And CURRY EVERYTHING TOO  JUST AMAZING"}

{"text":"Great atmosphere .... excellent flavors and fresh - behind fresh! Perfect place to explore..."}
{"text":"Love this place. Excellent food. Have not tried anything we did not like. Favorites are spicy fried rice and Pad Thai. Name you hotness!"}
{"text":"I've been here before. Love the Pad Thai. This time it was just okay though. Maybe it's just a difference of who was in the kitchen. It didn't have as much flavor as normal. When it's cooked how I normally like, this place is one of my favorites. They let you choose the spice level, include chicken and shrimp. 

I love the shrimp rolls. They are what one would expect. Fresh rice paper rolls filled with shrimp, noodles, lettuce and mint. The balance of ingredients is nice. Nothing is overpowering. There are two in an order. 

Definitely get the Thai tea with cream. It's so great. It's sweet but not to sweet. There are subtle nuances that are really brought out by the sweetness of the tea. 

The crab fried rice was just okay. It had decent flavor, and the rice was cooked fairly well. The pieces of crab were just a bit overdone. It was kind of a \"meh\" dish. Not too great, but not too bad, either. 

It didn't get 5 stars since they were understaffed and it was a bit messy (possibly due to the understaffing). I'd totally go back, and if you haven't been here, you need to try it"}
{"text":"I've been back a couple more times and it's still amazing. Try the pineapple fried rice (it comes with chicken and shrimp) yummmmmy!"}
{"text":"I called one night to order food the person who answered the phone was very rude she acted like she couldnt hear me and kept yelling into the phone what you say I finally hung up because I could see she clearly didnt want to help me! I will never give them business again"}
{"text":"When you order spicy food, they warn you they won't take it back if it is too hot for a reason...

Love Krua Thai. Haven't been to the new location but it looks great from the exterior. Food is fantastic. Best Thai in N Central Phx..."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai place to eat. If you are going for lunch then try to go there before 11:30 or you will end up by waiting outside. 

No need to mention the spicy level, may be you will become the fire breathing dragon  after eating the Thai spicy (number 5). if that is not sufficient then they have some special hot sauces ready for you on the table. you can try that sauces too.

Besides the hot thing, all curries have some special aroma and it's worth to give them a try. 

Giving 4 star just because, once my friend ordered the shrimp fried rice and shrimp was kind of under cooked."}
{"text":"I was warned by a fellow patron that the hot is really hot.  They have two levels above that, so I figured I was ok. The Papaya Salad was really hot, but the curry dish was not too bad when you add rice especially.  I would recommend this as the quality of the beef was good and the preparation of both dishes was good too."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS THE REAL DEAL! me and my fiance love thai food and we have been to many thai restaurants, but theres always something about the food that was off...this place serves the best tasting pineapple curry shrimp i have ever had! my fiance had the thai bbq chicken and the first words out of his mouth was \"this is definetly our new spot\". entrees are large, food is fresh, and prices are great. there is 74 entrees on the menu too. we already know what we are going to order next time. you wont be dissapointed."}
{"text":"Ordered take out from here yesterday and they had our food ready in fifteen minutes. Didn't have to wait long to pick up and pay for my order. The employees are friendly.

Let's discuss the food! The food is amazing. The veggie rolls are cook and fried to crispy perfection. The yellow curry was so delectable. We ordered it in a medium and it was perfect. I only wish it was thicker, but it's still amazing regardless.

The spicy noodles are good. Not as amazing as the curry but still very authentic. The noodles weren't overlooked and everything was just right. 

All in all, great for take out! Will have to eat inside next time!"}
{"text":"Solid 4 experience trying Chicken Pad Thai and Spicy Basil Chicken takeout entrees from here. Great option for those who live or work nearby as the prices are average, food was alright. I have another local Thai spot where the dishes just seem more flavorful and fresh so I'm likely to return there over Krua. Still a great option and their new location/decor makes for a great date/friends night out!"}
{"text":"I listened to you Yelpers and went to Krua Thai for dinner Saturday night. The place is located in a nothing strip mall where you would never expect to find such a great place.   It is small, clean and attractive with booths on either side and a few tables in the middle.  Decorated with Thai artifacts but not overdone.  
We were greeted in a very friendly manner and we took our time selecting from the menu because we don't do Thai food that often.  We decided on the vegetarian rolls as an appetizer, Sweet and Sour Chicken and Stir Fried Sweet Basil.  With the latter dish you get to choose what you want: Chicken, Pork, Beef or Tofu.  Shrimp is $2 extra.  I chose the tofu and asked that it be fried and then added to the dish--no problem she said.  I also asked for extra spiciness.  The veggie rolls were a nice size and delicious for $2.  Great so far.  The sweet and sour chicken came just as my hubby likes it, with no breading.  (That's why this dish chinese style is so high in calories.  The breading absorbs all the oil).  It had veggies including tomatoes.  I haven't see that before in sweet and sour chicken.  He loved it.  My Tofu dish was spicy enough for me, fresh and the tofu was fried as I had requested.  The dish even had bamboo shoots in it which I detest, but somehow it tasted good in this dish.  We were given plenty of lemon-flavored water to keep us hydrated.  We loved the food, the service and the place.  The total bill was $23.  How can you beat that for good Thai food?  Next time I'll try the Pad Thai --looked good when served to other patrons.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Krua is hands down the best Thai in Arizona, no doubt about it. The food is very authentic and you can taste the freshness in the ingredients. They have recently moved to a larger, much nicer location just across the street. I live next to ASU now but I'm still willing to make the journey all the way to Krua when I'm really craving good Thai. Once you've had it, you can't go back! I recommend the spicy chicken pad Thai and the green chicken curry."}
{"text":"First time at this place.  Ordered takeout.  Place is very nice looking inside.  Ordered yellow chicken curry.   It was real good not as good as two sisters but almost as good.
Also ordered two fried spring rolls.  Although they were deliciousthey were extremely oily and greasy.  This would not stop me from going back     The decor and this place is really nice      Will go back when I'm in the mood for takeout"}
{"text":"I love this place! Discovered it because my friend moved nearby but I would definitely drive here regardless. If you're a spice lover, like me, you will love this place. It's the spiciest food I've had in Arizona. My favorite dish here is the yellow curry with chicken."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this place put tonight and were pleasantly surprised.   I don't eat a lot of Thai, but after this, I'd definitely come back.  I had the rice noodle soup and was very pleased.  My wife had the ginger veggies and was also happy.  Give this place a try"}
{"text":"Great food if you like spicy stuff! EVERYTHING is spicy, even sweet-n-sour stuff. I highly recommend the chai tea. Very sweet, but absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food which is only surpassed by their beautiful Thai hospitality. This is the kind of place where you are always welcomed. Go once, and they never forget you. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here during a busy time and got treated very rudely. The waiters were almost scolding us for coming there and wanting to eat. Certainly doesn't make you feel welcome. They didn't even bother to serve water to us individually. They came and left a bunch of water on the table and left. 

Nothing special about the food either. Just mediocre Thai food. Their spiciness is more than average though. 

There are so many other places to eat in the region, just go eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"This is one of the few places that is delightfully small but the food is authentic and awesome. I have tried many dishes and the ton kha gai soup is my favorite. They could do a little better  with the service, the servers seem detached and barely talk to the customers."}
{"text":"Service ok. We like spicy so we ordered medium heat but it was extremely hot. I ordered beef salad...beef was tough and other than the extreme heat, lacked flavor. I am not found of iceberg lettuce. Place was busy for a Saturday lunch so apparently appeals to some folks but not for us."}
{"text":"The summer rolls were fresh and served with a delicious peanut hoisin sauce. Pad Thai was the best I've had in a while- I was impressed. The flavors and textures were there. I especially enjoyed the spice level- deep heat with sweetness from the house sauce, acid from the lime. I want some more right now!"}
{"text":"Best curry in town, bar none. Authentic flavors and spice!! Thai hot is not for the faint of heart. I love spicy but it's even too much for me. Go with medium if you order Thai hot everywhere else. I only ever get curry here because I'm obsessed so I don't have much experience with other items on the menu. I've had papaya salad and spring rolls. Both pretty standard. Curry is the way to go here. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Good food with great service. Specially for vegetarians they customized their food, we whatever ingredients you want or not they will server accordingly your choices."}
{"text":"I REALLY wanted to like this place! My boyfriend has ordered take-out from here a few times before and suggested we dine in, so yesterday we arrived around 5:30. 

We were seated right away and promptly given waters, then waited for our server for about 5 minutes, no big deal so far! He finally comes, and all he asks is if we are ready to order, so we order a few drinks and an appetizer. Not even 1 minute later, an older gentleman who I presume is the owner, asks if we are ready to order our dinner. When we tell him we need a few minutes, we are told, I shit you not, that we aren't allowed to have our menus once our appetizers get there because we will dirty the menus and the \"customers will complain\". I can't even believe how rude that was? Also apparently nobody knows how to wipe down a menu over there. 

My boyfriend's meal was so spicy it was inedible, my dish wasn't so great either. When I inquired whether mine was vegetarian (and explained that I don't eat fish either because some asian food places get confused on that), he looked confused and told me no because of the eggs in it, to which I explained this was okay! No eggs in my dish but it smelled fishy, kinda bummed about that!  We had to flag someone down for another round of drinks and more water.

Pros: The restaurant itself and the ambiance were beautiful! I have discovered a new love for plum wine, and the veggie spring rolls were amazing.

Cons: Not very friendly staff! Maybe it's because I work in a restaurant and pride myself on providing customer service, so I might be a little biased on that. I would like to give the food another chance in the FAR future, but I will not dine in here again."}
{"text":"I have been craving good Thai and remembered this place from years ago.  We arrived right at 5  and ordered quickly.

I am a purist; I love Pad Thai with lots of peanut sauce and Summer Rolls.  My friends had Spring Rolls, Satay, and Tom Yum.  We ate family-style and thought the meal was good

So here's where they lost me: we  finished our meal and the check arrived.  We were not asked I'd we wanted dessert or anything else.  At the one-hour mark, the owner came over and asked us to leave .  She had people waiting for tables, but there were plenty of empty tables so we were confused but paid up an left.

So. There you have it.  The food is decent but the way we were treated left something to be desired.  I did see people doing takeout .  That might be an idea for folks in the neighborhood but I'll have to find a place that lets me have dessert and coffee and relax a bit."}
{"text":"i came to visit my friends and they took me here. Everyone that works here is so nice. The food is very refreshing on a hot day in Arizona. The sandwich was great. I ordered another one and they separated the vegetables from the sandwich so that when i had it a day later, it was still delicious. the noodles with bbq pork was amazing. it's like inside of the pork summer roll."}
{"text":"I really liked this place! I ordered the chicken pad Thai and it was excellent. I recommend coming during lunch and getting the yellow curry or pad Thai. Overall great service, good atmosphere and yummy food."}
{"text":"Not the best in town, but I come back as I don't want to drive to central Phoenix. 

Service is always good, clean restaurant, only downfall the food is not consistent. 

When I went today the chicken had a different or strange taste to it, but nonetheless I finished my whole plate. I have that problem with Thai food, and I don't think it's because the spicy factor. 

Not bad, but not the best."}
{"text":"The pad thai and yellow curry here are both amazing dishes.  They moved from one location further west in the strip mall to the location they are today.  The only place only had about 6 tables in it, where this place is roughly double in size.  

You'll have no trouble getting a table for lunch.  The lunch pricing is reasonable, and the service is quite good."}
{"text":"Well, seems the reviews are up and down so may be I got lucky but, I will definitely be back! Food was hot and tasty! My only knock would be a little more protien in the meals would be nice however, the flavors & spices were just right!

Tom Kha was good, not my personal favorite but good.
Num Took was awesome!!
Pad Thai was great - ordered med and it was pretty hot! just wish for a little more chix & shrimp.

Very good overall - I will be back!"}
{"text":"The great food has always brought us back to this restaurant. The customer on the other hand has always been lacking. Tonight the customer service was non existent. We tried calling for half an hour to place an order for pick up. No answer. We get to the restaurant, the phone is being ignored while three employees stand at the counter. We place our order and are told it will take 20 minutes. We sit there for over 20 minutes only to find out they've lost our order! Frustrated we cancel our order and leave. We will NOT be coming back here again."}
{"text":"I really like  the food here..However, the restaurant is fairly small, and the parking lot isn't very big either. I would probably go there more , but when I went at lunch I was lucky I got there when I did.  They have lunch specials, and mine was very tasty.  This time I ordered a stir fry in peanut sauce that was most excellent. Every one around me seemed to be enjoying their dinner. But this place is worth a try , very good food and service."}
{"text":"The Thai is pretty good here. Though, the help is a little lacking. Duck Panang baby!"}
{"text":"My favorite Thai place. I've never had a disappointing meal here. Every curry I try tastes as good as the last."}
{"text":"Flavor was great and portions were good size.  This was our first time ordering from here. We'll be back for another visit that is for sure.  Only had take out so cannot comment on service or presentation."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place since they were located behind the Circle k! Finally got around to stopping by. I'm a huge fan of thai food to go but the inside of this establishment was so clean and nice (new location). I ordered the spicy fried rice, drunken noodles (pad kee mao), and panang curry. The panang curry was dynamite! They do it right! But the rice and noodle dishes were just okay. I wouldn't go out of my way to go here again, except for the panang curry. Maybe I'll try the pad Thai next time!"}
{"text":"Awesome Thai food great flavors and spices, Pad Thai and there spring rolls are amazing along with the red curry!!!"}
{"text":"So so yummy. Had a family meal here tonight, and am glad we chose Krua Thai. The service was fast & friendly, they were sweet to my kids, and the food was delicious. I had red curry with chicken & it was perfect!"}
{"text":"Delicious. This was our first visit since Thai Rama has been closed and we were not disappointed.The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The Tom Kah soup was some of the best I've ever had and the lemon infused water was a nice touch. We also had the sweet and sour chicken which was kinda meh but everything else was quite tasty. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Close to the house. Not bad for this part of town. Nice pleasant atmosphere inside. Service is good. You can peek through the serving window and see them making the food. I had the Tom Yum soup extra Thai spicy and it cleared up my stuffed up head within minutes. Great flavors. Simply Yummy!"}
{"text":"Dinner on the weekends gets pretty packed here! They are a family owned business and they are always super nice! My husband gets the Tom Kah soup and I get the Tom Yum the pad Thai is also very good and everything is fresh!"}
{"text":"I have been ordering a specific dish at this restaurant for a while. Th last time i ordered it, waaaay to spicy! I told them no additional spice. It was too hot for my partner, too. We told them but the owner refused to listen. $16.00 for my favorite dish and neither of us could eat it. Not going back."}
{"text":"The first review I read of this place said it was the \"only place to eat real thai food\" and after stopping in, I've very tempted to agree.

My friends and I were craving Thai after leaving the Yelp holiday party the other night.  So as this was the only place for such on the way back, we stop in.  While it's not much to look at on the outside, this tiny family-run restaurant just feels welcoming once you enter.  Well lit with sizable booths (the 4 of us didn't feel cramped) and a very friendly server/host/possibly-owner.

We all proceeded to order our various dishes.  Even though the place was a bit chilly, none of us went beyond the generic \"hot\" level of spice.  And when my Larb came out, I'm glad I didn't.  Yow!  I might love spicy food, but I'm gonna have to train before I can get to Thai Hot levels.

Of note, the pad Thai really seems quite good.  My brother ordered it and of all the dishes at the table I tried, that impressed me the most.  It's so easy to make pad thai bland and boring, but this had a nice gentle sweetness to it.

Not that I know exactly what \"real\" Thai food is, but I'll be coming back here regularly to get as close to it as I can."}
{"text":"I love this place. A mom 'n pop place serving very good Thai food at good prices. Watch out for the heat level and be sure to let them know if you want your food mild. And by the way, a bit of warning: If you order the \"garlic lovers,\" you had better be a BIG fan of garlic - in it's almost raw form. The garlic taste is truly intense, which is the way I like it, but I know that most people would probably find it a bit extreme."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  I have yet to have any dish that was not fabulous.  That only downside, is the restaurant is small and more often than not, you will have to wait to get a seat.  But, I chalk that up to the food being so good."}
{"text":"The green curry flavor is spectacular and the spice level of medium was perfect to clear my sinuses and awaken my senses. I asked for chicken with more vegetables in the curry and they kindly obliged.

The only thing I wish is that the curry would be thicker. There was a place I used to go to in San Clemente that had thick coconut curry and I prefer that texture. This is more like a soup.

The vegetables were over cooked and/or just not fresh. I like them still firm.

But even those things considered, a decent curry indeed.

8 bucks for lunch isn't bad either. About the cost of a Chipotle burrito."}
{"text":"Very attentive staff and very friendly. Food was excellent. I love spice and this place sure delivered. I ordered the pad kee mow, spicier than Thai hot. It was incredible. Great flavor, great spice. Would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Amazingly good Thai food. The service was good and the food was a real find in this strip mall. Pleasant decor"}
{"text":"Excellent service, decent food. Pepper steak was mild, curry fish was much tastier. There are other hole in the wall thai places in the area that i prefer but this was also good."}
{"text":"Most authentic Thai Ive ever had!! My favorite dish from when I was in Thailand was garlic pepper chicken and they do it perfectly!"}
{"text":"Finally delicious Thai food in Phoenix!! We ordered at about 8:10 on a Thursday night (they close at 8:30) and our order was ready by 8:20 for pickup, and they provided all sorts of sauces and spice cups and utensils, too.

I recommend the Pad Thai (it's sweet and not tomato-based like some adaptations), the yellow curry (yaaaas potatoes and so spicy your nose drips at \"medium\"), and my husband loved the shrimp summer rolls; they looked so fresh and he said they tasted amazing. 

We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Best Thai restaurant in the Valley! Authentic flavor and spices that I come back for.

Must try the Tom Yum Soup with medium spice at the least and Thai tea with cream is the usual. We restaurant has a great glass open front , so lots of light and view around you. Service is standard, sometimes you get the family owners other times an un-interested waiter so it dampens the feel, but once the food rolls out...Awesome! 

Warning if your sensitive to spice keep it Mild... their plates run hot. If you love spice, go for it here! They do it right."}
{"text":"ok so.. I'm obviously no thai connoisseur.. but I was really looking forward to a good peanut sauce with my Pad Thai.. Fail."}
{"text":"Walked in and the place had a funky smell, and not a good smell like baking bread...but a stinky fishy smell. It's been 2 hours and I still smell it. 

Ordered a couple appetizers that I really liked: fried wanton and egg rolls. Then the appetizer was Pad Thai. I found out where the smell was coming from. The sauce was this fishy, sweet, sour mix of anything but delicious...and overly yellowish orange; I keep thinking of Trump's face. And a bad after taste that tasted like detergent. 

Other half ordered fried rice something, something. He said it was ok, but he barely ate it. On the way home he said the rice was WAY overcooked. 

Lady next to us sent her dinner back...

But clearly people like it. Not me though. 

Parking was good."}
{"text":"I tried this place on a whim after searching for takeout using my phone. I was pleasantly surprised and will definitely make another visit. The Spicy Cashew and Deep Fried Tofu with Vegetables was really good and so was the Pad Thai. I'm looking forward to trying some of the other dishes. The inside was casual and clean."}
{"text":"This place is tasty but don't expect any kind of friendly service or order modification. 
I asked for rice to be substituted with egg noodles and they told me they cannot do that. So instead I just purchased egg noodles. I got my order and they didn't even give me the rice I paid for. 

So they don't do that but yet they kept the rice and gave me egg noodles that I paid $2.75 extra for. I will not be returning to this place. Any suggestions on a great Thai place????"}
{"text":"From the outside not much to look at but inside, that's a different story.  I shared the Spicy Fried Rice, Pad Thai, and Hot Curry Catfish.  All were excellent with great flavor!  The Spicy Rice was cooked with lots of fresh veggies and not too over powering.  The Pad Thai is legit as all the other reviews say and the Catfish Curry was a nice discovery. The jalapeños definitely up the heat factor and overall its a great dish."}
{"text":"It's a great place to pop in for a quick lunch, but have an even better dinner menu. I generally get one of the curry lunch dishes and love the soup and spring rolls they serve. Delicious! I'd highly recommend trying this place out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I got a order to go. They were very quick and the food is delicious! I got my dish spicy, and it's very spicy! Love it. They give you a big portion for a great price."}
{"text":"Amazing! We ordered red curry & panang curry and they both were so good. I really enjoy spicy but I decided to be safe and order medium - which they told me would still be pretty spicy. My mouth was at a perfect balance of on fire and delicious. I would definitely recommend. Also, we ordered take-out and there was plenty for two meals :)"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place. I went there for lunch last week and it was so good I went back for dinner tonight. I had garlic chicken which is sauteed with mushrooms and scallions in a delicious sauce. Service was excellent. Another plus it's BYOB. What an oasis in a desert of fast food  all along along the way."}
{"text":"Taking a break from Christmas shopping, I found myself with a Thai food craving. I'd heard great things about this place from somebody I trust, and jumped back on the bike to scoot over for lunch.

Long story short, this is the real deal. Pad Thai and an iced coffee was just the thing, although trust the waiter when he questions your choice of \"hot\"... I'm going to dial it back a notch next time.

Portion size was perfect for lunch, with a small spring roll on the side. Service is quick and personable, and prices are absolutely reasonable. I will def be back to work my way through other menu items!

Edit - 5/1/2017

Same great recipes, but service faltered hard for our lunch visit today. Thinking they took the same level of help to the new location - twice as big, busy and nice - and having a hard time keeping up.

\"Recalculating\" as my GPS likes to say."}
{"text":"Awesme food.. Also affordable prices.. Best thai food for me in phx.. Definitely a good try.. The place is little small but its ok, thai food is worth it here"}
{"text":"Our first time here. Excellent!  Our appetizer was Thai Toast.....well prepared and served with the best cucumber/jalapeno sweet and sour topping we have had. My wife and I had two different seafood dishes....both were amazing. Coconut ice cream for dessert was wonderful. Restaurant is clean and well organized. Highly recommended!!!!!"}
{"text":"A great option for delicious Thai food in North Phoenix!

I met my parents here for dinner the other night and was pleasantly surprised. The restaurant itself is bright and modern and very clean and the service is very friendly and efficient. 

We started with the Thai toast and vegetable spring rolls. The spring rolls were wonderful but I was not impressed with the Thai toast. It's a favorite appetizer of ours when going out for Thai but it was soggy here and I wasn't a fan of the flavor. We also ordered the sweet basil chicken stir fry, duck, orange chicken and the Thai BBQ chicken. All of this was served with white rice. The orange chicken was ok, the duck was quite good, the basil chicken was tasty but the BBQ chicken was delicious! I have a very pick teen who ordered this and he was in love. We finished the meal off by sharing the coconut ice cream. We look forward to going back and trying some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"Thought I'd try out some of the local cuisine. Tasted a ton of Thai cuisine in my foodie travels. Went with my bf to eat in and decided to try some of their healthy dishes as shown in the pictures. Needless to say the best part of my entire experience was the appetizer. My shrimp salad was sloppy and under seasoned, the \"hot\" sake I ordered came cold after I reminded them twice about it. They forgot my tea as well and my bf's salad was basically soup. They had the nerve to charge us $40 for prison food. Out of all the Thai cuisine I've ever had this is by far the worst experience. I don't know where they bought the reviews from, but the only thing they know how to do right is their Pad Thai. 

Sincerely,
The Karma Chef"}
{"text":"Just horrible.  Tea was rancid and curry was sour rather than sweet-hot.  Waiter pushed back when I sent the bad food away.  I recommend bypassing this place.  I will never go back."}
{"text":"Best eat in and take out Thai Restaurant . 
Everything YUMMY! And reasonably priced.
Friendly accommodating service. 
So glad this is just a few blocks from my home. Healthy, and Delicious!"}
{"text":"Seriously a favorite. We've dined in, and we've gotten take out. And both are awesome! So happy to finally find an awesome thai place in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Been here several times and love it. Clean, attractive restaurant, delicious food, friendly service, reasonable prices. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Another great lunch at Krua's!
I had the lunch special Sweet Basel with beef along with their version of ice tea. 
Service was fast and efficient.
The meal itself was delicious as always!

The restaurant has gone upscale since they relocated but their portion sizes and prices have remained the same on the items I purchase. 

What more can I say?"}
{"text":"Went to have dinner with my bf. Both of us ordered beef Pad Thai, it tasted delicious but a little bit \"sour\" but still good!

I ordered Thai Tea and my bf ordered Thai Coffee, as a Thai Tea lover, I wish they used the huge glass for thai tea! It's so good!!! And that's the reason why I gave 4 stars, lol.

And also ordered their sticky rice, it was warm when they served it and \"soft\", you can tell they make it fresh!

The waitress was nice and friendly, she asked if everything was okay, if the food taste good...

Pad Thai (choose meat by yourself): $10.95
Thai Coffee & Thai Tea: around $3
Sticky Rice: $3

I will come back to Krua again :)"}
{"text":"Vegetarian Dishes are AWESOME!

Tom Kha Soup with vegetables and Pad Thai (no egg) with vegetables are the best in Phoenix.


Sticky Rice for dessert is very tasty, too!"}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place. Thai Rama is the best I've had in the valley...just out of this world! I've loved everything I have tried...and I've been back about 4 times since discovering this place just a few weeks ago! Do yourself a favor and try it....just be patient if you dine in."}
{"text":"Love this little, genuine place! It has great lunches and has ruined me for pad Thai anywhere else in the valley! Their soups are a must!"}
{"text":"My favorite Thai in the valley but I haven't tried it after it moved across the street."}
{"text":"Best Thai Food in the area!  Delicious!  My children even love it!  I have been going there even before I had children at the previous location.  I have been a customer for over 15 years!!!  LOVE IT!!"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place.......reviews are 100% spot on.

Some of the freshest, best-tasting Thai we've experienced anywhere......the Tom Kha soup - to die for!!    

Curry - fantastic...........loved the Chili Fried Rice - delicious!

Love that it's BYOB as well...........small strip-mall location........can't be beat.

If you think you like (love) Thai - you owe it to yourself to try this place out."}
{"text":"We really enjoy Krua Thai.  Its a small place and never super crowded.  The food has been reliably delicious.  My husband prefers Krua Thai to Sala Thai, but I'd maybe say it's a tie with overall experience being better at Krua and food maybe slightly better at Sala."}
{"text":"Simply amazing. Every little detail was perfect from the temperature of the soup to the spiciness of the sauce. I got the Vegetables and Rice with medium spice and it was perfect. The soup that came with the lunch special was amazing. 

The sweet n sour sauce is off the hook. 

Our waitress was knowledgeable and able to help my girlfriend decide on what to get. Always had what we needed. 

Ambiance is great. Nice and quiet and mellow. A perfect way to relax and eat.  

All this for $17 + tip to feed 2 people till they were about to explode?! 

We will be back...a lot."}
{"text":"Love this place! Hubby and I have made this our Saturday lunch spot. Food is awesome--red curry chicken is my fave. My husband loves the yellow curry. The best part? They do lunch specials-even on Saturday! Service is good, they know that when we walk in to bring a regular tea for me and Thai Tea for him. The coconut ice cream is a fabulous treat as well. Awesome local spot."}
{"text":"Excellent yellow curry with chicken. I ordered medium and it was a TRUE medium heat not that bland like most are. Although there was way too many potatoes in it I thought the flavor kind of made up for it. The rice was cooked great too. 

I didn't like the spring rolls. The wrapping was soaked too long and I believe that there was a whole lot of ice burg lettuce in it. The tiny bit of peanut sauce was watery too. But the curry did make up for it. 

I only give three stars because of the abundance of potatoes in the curry compared to the meat and carrots and also because the spring rolls were not good at all."}
{"text":"Yes...YES...Yes...Finally a real thai taste = clean hot thai spice. Complex flavors with spice - front & mid tongue! Come try this yummy Mom & Pop restaurant. Clean, Cozy and Friendly Vibes await you along with a truly authentic meal. Already looking forward to our next visit!! Lunch specials look awesome....
P.S.  So glad that sauces were not overly sweetened for american palate."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! I'm that annoying person who always walks in here ten minutes before close and asks for take out. They always accommodate and are incredibly friendly! Outstanding food and wonderful people. Pad Thai is great, yellow curry better. Beware of the spice! :)"}
{"text":"I wasn't super hungry so I ordered the Garlic Lovers with mixed veggies. It's served with mushroom, onion, garlic sauce over lettuce. 

Sounded simple. 

It was HORRIBLE! First off there were NO mushrooms. It tasted like someone took a cup filled it with minced garlic from a jar and dumped it on my dish. The garlic was crunchy, there was no sauce, it They took $5 so it only cost me $4 to have one bite of it. 

My boyfriend liked his sweet and sour chicken, it's what he always gets at Thai restaurants because he loves cooked cucumbers.  It wasn't at the top of his list but he would order it again. 

We ordered two spring rolls (the ones without shrimp, they had different ones) and they were great. 

We just moved down the street from this place so it's possible we will be back, but they have a lot of improving to do!"}
{"text":"Good food, very fair price, and a nice variety on the lunch menu. The service was pretty quick. I ordered the sweet basil with beef and was not disappointed. I would gladly go back."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and eat here. Fresh classic traditional cuisine.  Always amazing."}
{"text":"We eat here all the time. Great food. Great staff. :) green curry, yellow curry, panang, and beef salad are some of my favorites!"}
{"text":"First time having Thai food, was told by a friend to have their cashew chicken, I wasn't that big of a fan tbh, I got medium spice level because I wasn't sure what to expect, I would try it again, just not this same dish. Great little spot otherwise, very friendly staff and very inexpensive."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of creamier curries and theirs was ok. I tried the yellow curry and it was delicious, but the sauce wasn't as creamy as I liked it. 

The place is well-kept, clean, and I love that the tables have an actual authentic rose as a centerpiece (a small detail, but I appreciated it). My favorite thing about my visit to this restaurant was getting the Tom Yum soup. I'm an incredibly big fan of Tom Yum soup and this bowl was so delicious, it almost made me cry. 

Delicious dinner, pleasant experience. I'll definitely come back for that soup."}
{"text":"Great place 
AWSOME food 
Amazing service 
The food is really spicy if you get it more then mild , but in the long run you will get use to it 
I been there twice before I am giving this review and the second time I even liked it more 
My favorite is the soup ( something Tom ) 
So so good 
The only reason for the 4 stars and not 5 is bc of there prices 
For me Thai food cheap middle class food 
But here the price are really high 
Still worth it but really expansive 
Enjoy"}
{"text":"Go-to Thai in the north valley. Always great food and friendly service. Tom kha soup is incredible!"}
{"text":"I don't know how to start this review without saying that this is probably the BEST Thai restaurant I have ever tried. That says a lot coming from a man who used to live in Los Angeles where Asian restaurants are in every corner. 

I should start by telling the world what my usual KRUA THAI regimen is. First, I get the awesome crispy tofu appetizer plus some Thai tea and Vietnamese iced coffee. Thinking about the tofu right now makes me want to go there STAT. 

Obviously, Asian lunch or dinner is not complete without the carbs so I order and munch on the combination Fried rice that consists of beef, shrimp, onions, garlic and brown rice.  

Lastly, I grab the most awesome dish that they offer in my opinion which is the PANANG CURRY! It is literally the best Thai dish I have ever eaten. Enough said! 

I could talk all day about their food but this review will not be complete without mentioning their GENUINE service.  The staff are always polite in taking orders and in explaining their menu. I have been to this place a thousand times and I haven't had any issues with my orders or the attitude of any member of the staff. The servers are just true and honest. 

I rate this place 6 out of 5 stars. While it is true that food is what really matters in restaurants, genuine service greatly affects the satisfaction of customers."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. I was here back in October as my usual go to Thai place had closed unexpectedly. So I searched for Thai places in the area and this one came up. I had ordered some Pad Thai and another dish that I cannot recall, however when I got home, I was not impressed. The noodles were not the Pad Thai noodles that I was used to but ramen noodles, and the taste was very bland. Plus it was really oily. I have no idea what was going on but it was definitely not the usual Pad Thai I was used to. 

Fast forward to yesterday and a friend suggested we meet here for dinner. Needless to say I was apprehensive but I decided to give them another chance. I ordered the Stir Fried Sweet Basil, Thai Hot. Yea Thai Hot as a few other restaurants in which I ordered Thai Hot came no where close to as hot as it was supposed to be. Krua Thai redeemed themselves as this dish was very flavorful, even though it was Thai Hot. Believe it or not, the spiciness did not ruin the dish. I was happy to have the Thai Iced tea because I actually needed it with this dish. I have already had a small serving of my leftovers for breakfast and it is even spicier and better than yesterday. I will be back to try some other dishes and I am very happy that I gave them a second chance."}
{"text":"This is by far the most authentic Thai restaurant in the Valley. The owner/mom is always in the back actually cooking with a homemade family feel, fresh ingredients as if she was your mom cooking a meal just for you! The wait stay are all very polite and very accommodating in helping you pick a dish for your desire. Some of their recommendations have become my favorites. Thai stir fried Sweet Basil, Yum woon sen, Tom Yum soup, and all the curry dishes. There are to many to list. I have my favorites but I always try something new and they are all great!!! Every where I go I recommend Krua Thai."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Thai food. I ordered the Veggie Red Curry, medium heat. But they accidentally mixed up my order with another customers. I took one bite and thought my head would explode. He ordered extra extra spicy. That experience was awful, but the staff corrected my order and multiple people apologized when they saw the tears running down my face from the heat. Honest mistake, although I may have burned off a few taste buds in the process. The owner even stopped by to apologize. They corrected my order and it was delicious. The Thai ice tea was also larger than I'm used too which was awesome! I would definitely go back. It's tucked away in a strip mall, but don't be fooled by that, it is quite delicious."}
{"text":"You know this place is authentic when you have a Thai grandma in the kitchen.  We ordered shrimp rolls, papaya salad, and Tom yum.  All dishes were delicious!  The customer service was great.  Everyone was very nice!  I would recommend trying this place out."}
{"text":"I called them couple of times to place a take out order.  They never answer their phone. Can't comment on their food."}
{"text":"I haven't tried all of the food yet, by so far the chicken fried rice is my favorite. The dish is light and a nice amount of food for the price. The space is clean and the menu looks amazing."}
{"text":"Nothing to rave about, there are better Thai places around. Their seafood soup is good just make sure you tell them if you cannot handle too spicy ."}
{"text":"Krua Thai does differ from other Thai Restaurants. They offer a very large menu of many Thai Dishes including a very hard to find northern curry dish called Kang Pa Curry (jungle curry, forest curry, kaeng pa). Other ways that they differ are that portions are large and they put more meat in the dishes than other Thai Restaurants I've been too. They also make HOTTER Thai Food......I ordered Hot....Hot here might be Thai Hot at most places and they got two levels that are hotter than hot.

The atmosphere is fresh and attractive.

Service was very good.

They have a lot going for them but my reasons for three stars are -
The chicken in both dishes was dry. 
They use very little fresh herbs and herbs are very essential to the spicy basil dish....
Both dishes the kang pa and the spicy basil were very granular. The texture of the sauces were strange and granular. I don't know but it seemed like instead of a fresh hot pepper they used some sort of powder....The sauces seemed like they were filled with wet powder.

This place will do in a pinch for a Thai Food Craving. Atmosphere and service are above average and they serve beer and wine.

Remember HOT is maybe what other places serve as Thai Hot. I think most people want less than hot here."}
{"text":"Met some friends for lunch.  It was busy!  I take that as a good sign.  They have really great and inexpensive lunch specials which I highly recommend.  Their yellow curry and pad Thai were both delicious.  They serve their lunch specials with an interesting veggie soup unlike anything I've ever had at a Thai restaurant.  It was good!  The spring rolls were also yummy.  

The service wasn't awesome and no one working here was very friendly but I'd return if in the area."}
{"text":"First time visit on a random drive-by lunch.  Clean.  Modern.  Well-run.  Lunchtime patrons mostly corporate types.  Quality down to the napkin you are provided.  For $8 you can get a modest lunch plate - they offer several different curries plus about a half-dozen other lunch special entrees.  I had a very spicy chicken curry dish which came with dollops of steamed rice,  slivers of raw cabbage, and (in a nod to it's fairly gringo locale) a fried spring roll with a sweet dipping sauce.  Quality over quantity.  

Like MacArthur, I will return..."}
{"text":"Great lunch specials for $8 currently.  Clean restaurant with modern decor.  Decent service and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've had in the Valley, hands down- only rivaled by the amazing service! All I can say is that we will now become regulars! Thanks for the great experience!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, I came here last minute because I needed food and it was getting late. Had never been here before. 
The food was good. Really good. HOWEVER... The a$$hat that runs this place is a jerk. If you have kids, and don't shove a phone or tablet in their face... prepare for him to be a jerk. 
My son accidentally spilled his water when reaching for the salt, and they were ticked about it. We cleaned as much as we could. It was an ACCIDENT! 
My daughter wanted to see the light inside the lamp and was standing up (she's 4!) looking in it . And then, as I was trying to pay, which took awhile, and get ahold of my TRUCK DRIVER HUSBAMD WHO IS CROSS COUNTRY.. my son was ticking his sister. And the owner decided to lecture me about not watching my kids. Because a 4 year old was laughin, and my son spilled water? Really? It was rude, and awful for him to react that way. No manners. He never once even talked to me prior to chewing me out, and then when I asked him to repeat what he said, because he basically whispered it, he said \"you heard me\". Geez. Not kid or family friendly."}
{"text":"Drove by it many times thought we gave it a try on date night. We ordered tofu tom yum large order and a noodle dish. The soup was fresh and hot except they charge us for a seafood soup instead of a tofu soup. The noodle with the brown gravy was good but the portion was small. 
Lesson learn for the night.... don't let the bf read the receipt."}
{"text":"Nice people. Cute little place. But the food isn't that great. The meat was undercooked both times I tried beef and chicken. The only two good things are the veggie rolls and the vegetable soup. The vegetable soup is really tasty and has a lot of flavor in it. I don't recommend it unless it was for either of those."}
{"text":"Spicy fried rice with medium spice was wonderful. I like spicy and if I had asked for more than medium, it would have been too much. My daughter ordered the yellow curry and it was excellent! Very welcoming and attentive waitstaff! Will return!"}
{"text":"I can be very selective on Thai food. This place was amazing. The Pad Thai I ha was outstanding!"}
{"text":"First visit was not that impressive.  Service was great, place was nearly full but the flavor profiles were way off with limp texture.  

The Tom Yam Goong soup was extremely sweet, not so sour and lacking spice but had a generous portion of shrimp and mushrooms.  The pineapple curry was made with canned pineapple that was excessively sweet and limp.  The Pad Kee Mao had vegetables that were limp from overcooking. We had water for drinks so these three items totalled the bill to $39.00, tip additional.  

Every restaurant has feature dishes, we must have chosen some of the wrong items."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Thai food and have visited Thailand but don't eat it too often because the Thai restaurants Near my home are just so-so. So I was delighted to find this place on a business trip. The yellow curry was one of the tastiest I have ever eaten. Service was quick and efficient and the prices for lunch were excellent. They were understanding of how to prepare food completely vegetarian. (No fish sauce in the curry.)"}
{"text":"I love Thai food and this place was amazing!  Great food (I had the Yellow Curry and the girlfriend had the Pad Thai)  Both were great!  The GF likes everything super HOT and it was!  Be careful!  We also had the coconut milk soup and it was to die for.  It's a small place, but the service was great.  Don't expect 5 star atmosphere, but all in all very good and excellent prices.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is just excellent. I went with my wife and we couldn't get enough from the appetizer to the main dishes. We are vegetarian and as most Thai restaurants are they were very accommodating with tofu substitutions. We had the fried tofu appetizer, pineapple fried rice, tofu pad thai, and tofu massaman curry. All excellent with plenty left to take home."}
{"text":"The food here is great.  At this point I have had several items off of their menu at varying degrees of heat and all have met or exceeded my expectations as well as those of  my friends and family.

The service is fast and friendly and the food always comes out hot off the stove and cooked just right.  I have not been to Thailand but I have eaten at many places and can easily say that this is the best around.

Give this place a try and you will not be sorry.  Plus, it super nice to support a small business - especially when the food rocks."}
{"text":"This place is right down the street from me, so it's definitely convenient. I think their food is delicious! I've had the Pad Thai several times, the garlic chicken, and the green chili chicken. I was not disappointed by any of them. I highly recommend it. The staff is always polite and the service is great."}
{"text":"First time here and very happy.  This is a great, small family oriented place.  The Tom kha soup was excellent.  The fried rice was pretty darned good too.  Very busy at lunch and for good reason.   We will be back to try different menu items and these stars may go up."}
{"text":"I have had some of the best Thai food of my life in this little hole in the wall. I have also had better than OK, it really depends on the dish. The Thai BBQ chicken is outstanding, the panang is the best, the tom kha soup is the best I have ever had, the basil chicken is great, the larb is fantastic, the pineapple fried rice is a treat, the catfish is awesome and I don't like catfish. The deserts are hot! the mango sticky rice is my fave but they also make there own coconut ice cream and serve it with sticky rice, delish. The place is owned by a Thai family and the son is the server, he doesn't speak much English but if you become a regular he takes good care of you. I love hot food and when I say Thai hot, wow I loved that I was crying and blowing my nose between each bite. If you like it hot make it very clear to him how hot and you will get it. Most Americans ask for Thai hot and then complain, so just reassure him and you will get it. They leave every year for a month during the summer so you are warned. They do not serve alcohol but you can bring your own and he doesn't charge. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Best Thai in Phoenix.  By far best Thai around.  I drive a long ways to come here.  Service is great, menu huge, food is awesome.  Real Thai...pretty sure you could strip lead based paint off furniture with anything prepared Thai hot.  It's Thai food the way it is supposed to be.  Also chicken is super lean and awesomely prepared.  Place is best Thai I've been to in Phoenix let alone the United States."}
{"text":"Chicken Basil is the BOMB!!! and their free soup is so yummy!!! Love it! =)"}
{"text":"Another delicious meal at one of our favorite neighborhood restaurants! Great service and the food is always fabulous! Meals always come quickly and are piping hot!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend getting their Garlic Chicken lunch special! I promise you'll thank me after :)"}
{"text":"I was excited to find out I had a Thai restaurant close by..unfortunately I was very disappointed with the flavor, or lack there of. I was so totally jonesin' for some Pad Thai and ordered some chicken Pad Thai (medium spicy) for take out.. I got home...the dish does appear rather bland looking as is... took a bite and was NOT  impressed. I feel like Im eating plain rice noodles with a kick.. either they went too light on the sauce, or perhaps Pad Thai is just not their thing... The ingredients seemed fresh, but execution of this dish was lacking. Guess Ill have to travel further to feed my pad thai cravings!"}
{"text":"This is the only place to eat Real Thai Food inside of a couple hundred miles.

If you want something thai hot, this is the place.  It is doubtful you will find anyone willing to make it right with heat anywhere else in town.

We ate here so many times after we discovered it, and it was always consistently great.

A hard working family establishment.  You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Every Friday, my work team and I go out for TFF (thai food friday) at Krua Thai and I always get the same order, the chicken fried rice (medium spice). Krua Thai is my favorite Thai restaurant in North Phoenix and you all need to check it out. The staff is super friendly, the food is always tasty, and they are super fast during lunch!"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant several times over the past several years and when I had a craving for Thai I decided to check this place out once again.  I had seen that it has moved and was dismayed when it was no longer in its old location.  Thankfully, I checked Yelp and realized they had moved just a couple of blocks west in the Whipples shopping center into a much bigger location to accommodate their growing number of clients (way to go!).  Bummed at first, but super happy when I finally found it our family enjoyed a wonderful Thai dinner complete with Thai teas and an iced Thai coffee (all of which are MUST haves).  Dinner was amazing, as always and the deserts were so delicious.  If you're looking for a wonderful Thai restaurant, you must try Krua Thai.  Just remember that it is in the Whipples Fun Center shopping center.  South side."}
{"text":"I think overall this place is more of a 3.5 stars. The Pad See Ew was not that great. Needs more sauce, the noodles were a bit dry. The green curry was delicious. The papaya salad was good, but I don't know that I'd get it again. The medium hot was a bit too spicy for me because I'm a wimp when it comes to spicy. I'd say the medium hot is a bit spicier than Serracha."}
{"text":"Messed up my order, had to go back to get it remade and it still wasn't right... Best the owner said she will do is 15% off my next order.... AS IF I would ever come back. Horrible customer service! Food was just OK.. nothing like the normal Thai food I am used to.. Too bad.. this was my first and last time trying this place. If you're really hungry don't risk ordering from here.. they messed up all 3 of our orders"}
{"text":"Oh my, where do I start? let me say it this way. We tried this place because we thought service was going down in our regular Thai place... well, I will be happy to take the old place slowness anytime, compared to how rude the people at this place were to us.

I honestly am not sure if they know we are paying customers, it was a combination of people with bad manners doing you a favor, and being reprimanded at school.

The food was good, but not awesome to put up with this. And the worst part is that our party was 5 and they included the gratuity in our check. I think people are entitled to have a bad day but I really could not believe it. I would never tip a penny, but if I ever did, this was the time.

The coconut soup is good, I think that is the only item I had. So, about 3.5 stars for the food, 1 for the service. 

Now, if you are not sensitive as I am, give it a try : P"}
{"text":"Great Thai food.  Best Fried tofu, Panang and delicious Pad See WThis is such  a nice quiet and cozy Thai restaurant.  The owner and her daughter are really amazing hard working people.  Very kind and very professional.  Everyone else"}
{"text":"Flavorful curries and yummy Thai iced tea. We've only done simple takeout items so far but haven't been disappointed with anything we've ordered."}
{"text":"Best Thai in town, hands down! Every thing we've had here over the last year has been wonderful and very spicy (and requested - unlike many Thai restaurants that won't do that for us white-folk)! I love it here! And worth the drive across town for me!"}
{"text":"Always good food, good fast service, and clean. I can't ask for more. Reliable service for the past year and half I've been coming here, before they moved across the corner. :)"}
{"text":"Went here one night for take out after going to zumba across the street.  The tom yum was delicious and spicy.  The thai beef salad puzzled me because it had all the cooked part at the bottom and had iceberg lettuce on top.  That was probably a good idea to make it travel, but not a fan of the iceberg.  And when I got back to my hotel room and had no utensils I was annoyed, but the soup was good enough to sip from the cup.  I will probably try it again and skip the salad."}
{"text":"This hole in the wall restaurant is amazing.  The food is flavor packed and always fresh.  In fact, they even grow some of their own herbs.  The place is quiet and the prices are very reasonable.  Best place for Thai in town."}
{"text":"Best Thai restaurant in Phoenix! I have been going here for the last year (once a week for the last year) and have always been satisfied with their food. If you like Thai food this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Food here is awesome! I can't believe I've been living in the area for 2 years and am just now finding Krua Thai. Plenty of choices for vegetarians as they offer to substitute tofu instead of meat. The Pad Thai was delicious and I loved the vegetarian spring rolls.  My only complaint is that the rolls were pretty oily, I blotted mine with a napkin before eating and they were perfect, still very crispy. I will definitely be back again! Likely on a weekly basis."}
{"text":"Liked the food - the fresh spring rolls weren't the best I've eaten. But the main course was good. Food was truly spicy!"}
{"text":"First experience was a hit ordering hot green curry with chicken. Curry was flavorful and cooked perfectly. Since this was my first visit, I asked about the spice. 
I like \"American Hot\" but not \"Thai Hot\", but the restaurant offers mild, medium, hot, extra hot, and Thai hot. The waitress advised me to go with medium, but I tried Hot and it was perfect.  
The place is not the most physically attractive.  Go for food only, not ambiance."}
{"text":"Ive been here twice now I'm glad it's close to my house. Although it gets busy at lunch time. Their curry was great I just tried their crab fried rice I liked it."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite Thai food place and I would order to-go food from this restaurant pretty often. On this occasion, I ordered the summer rolls, coconut soup, and the Panang curry chicken. I ordered the soup and the chicken both mild as my dinner guests do not like spicy food. I myself do not mind spicy foods. I checked the order in my car to make sure all the items were present and they were so I was relieved. I brought the food all the way home and we started digging in. The summer rolls and the soup were both delicious as usual but the Panang curry was so spicy we could not even eat it. I called the restaurant and she said they would make a new one. She was very adamant about me brining the original dish back, which I had no problem with since it was too spicy to even eat. I drove all the way back and handed over the original food. The lady in the kitchen was very unhappy and rude that she had to remake the dish but instead of throwing my original food away she took it back and set it on the kitchen line. Now being that I was a server and bartender for over 10 years, I know this is not the typical practice nor sanitary so I watched what became of the food. She kept looking over at me and finally took the food into the back somewhere. She brought it back moments later and they handed it to me to take home. I opened it right there in front of them and it looked so soupy. I did not see any new dish being made so I can only believe that she added water and god knows what else to the original Panang curry. At this point, I had had enough rudeness and poor customer service so I handed the bag back and asked for a refund. They could have just remade the dish the right way but instead they lost customers over an $11 dish. Very disappointing to say the least."}
{"text":"great lunch specials. I got the pad thai which came with an egg roll and soup for under 8 bucks! I got medium spicy and I couldn't handle it. I'll probably go with mild next time. haha"}
{"text":"Say hello to my little friend! Food was good, staff was friendly, and Thai hot is THAI HOT. YUM! I have had spicy basil fried rice that is pretty good at other establishments that would give this place a run for the money but I am not complaining! Give it a try!!"}
{"text":"Our first visit was perfection! We were seated immediately and served water right away. Then they took our drink and food order. The staff was AMAZING! We went on a weeknight, so it wasn't crowded. That allowed us to sit and visit after we finished our meal. The owner was sweet and told us that she didn't mind us taking up the table. However, gave us a fair warning that if we visit on a busy night that she usually allows diners to stay an extra 10-minutes after completing their meal and then they need to give up the table. Lol. I loved how matter of fact she was and appreciate the insider knowledge.

We shared a plate of wontons (yum!). I had a Thai iced tea with my chicken pad Thai. It was so much food that I barely ate half of it. Took the rest home for a delicious lunch the next day!"}
{"text":"Man, I am going to miss Krua when I move back to Washington. I was pretty convinced the Southwest just didn't understand Thai food the way the West coast did, but I've been proven wrong. I'm updating my review because I finally got the chance to eat inside. I love the decor! It's just a small hidden place but it really is worth eating inside.

I started with a water and a sweet Thai iced tea. I've never had anything like it! Super sweet and served with heavy cream on top. When stirred, the whole drink turns a bright orange. It was a really nice contrast to what we ordered..

Pineapple fried rice. Shrimp panang curry. Tofu pad thai. Veggie spring rolls. Get ready to say the Lord's name in vain, because that's all I can really do when I eat food from here. It's just great. I love the pad thai especially because it isn't overly greasy or soupy at all. The tofu was really good, pan-fried to perfection. And I like it hot! Even at a mere 'medium' spice it was burning my palate. The veggie rolls were meatless and were made with lots of pepper counteracted by the sweet and sour sauce. Steaming hot, extra-crisp. Great big portions make for plenty of leftovers for tomorrow's lunch.

The service is quick and the man who always seems to be working is so so friendly. We got pretty cold from a breeze coming in, and he even closed the door. 

I don't care what you Thai purists have to say... I get around when it comes to pad thai and this place is duking it out in my heart for first."}
{"text":"Krua is our go to for Thai when we're not looking to drive (Siam is the best in Phoenix but a bit of a hike).  The food is always good and price is reasonable - we normally get the pad thai and a curry, alternating between yellow and pineapple curry with duck.  For the pad Thai, don't expect anything fancy - they serve up a more basic version than other americanized fare.  And watch out when spicing it up here - medium is on par with Thai spicy at other joints.  Go ahead and play it safe, they've got a shaker of spice at every table in case you need to up it a notch.  Don't forget to order a Thai iced tea to wash everything down."}
{"text":"Food still delicious and super spicy!
Server was horribly rude. I had the flat noodles with chicken and shrimp. Taste was good however the dish was missing noodles. I asked the server for more noodles but instead of helping he pointed pieces of noodle and wanted to charge more for noodles.
Rude server."}
{"text":"I love curry and I love spicy and this place delivers!  Not much on atmosphere but if you like curry dishes and spicy food you can get it here.  I  LOVE hot and let me warn you now, when you order, you can order mild, medium, hot, and Thai hot.  The hot is on the edge of the max I can take. There is a Thai place in Scotttsdale where I order very hot and it's maybe as spicy as the medium hot is here at Krua Thai.  Give it a try and thank me later."}
{"text":"My mom and I love this place. The owners are so sweet and the food is divine. My Mom always orders the yellow curry dish every time we go there. I adore their thai basil dish with chicken. We frequent this place so much that the owners and chefs know my mom.

First of all, their lunch specials are awesome. There are many options, and they come with a cup of soup and a spring roll. Their soup of the day is always different and so, so delicious. I have gone in here just for the soup before! The dinner sizes are also available throughout the entire day, and the portions are pretty large. I would recommend the lunch specials though, its enough food and the soup and spring rolls are so yummy!!"}
{"text":"Thai is high on my list of cuisine, 1st for the delicious flavors , particularly the coconut cream bases, curries and noodles. 

With that said this is a new find for us.  We began with Tom yum ga soup, medium.  Perfect!!! Great spice level and great flavor with the shrimp.  Next for my entree I had the pad see ew, fried flat noodles, with chicken.  I asked for a Spivey version and medium.  A dangerous proposition before my 62 mile Diabetes ride but it hit the spot and was the perfect tasty carb load I needed.  

My wife and I loved this place.  Good service and worth the 45 minute wait on a busy Friday.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I have been going to their old location for the past five years I have never had a bad meal here. Their new location has a wonderful ambience very modern and very clean. I always get the Panang! I will say I absolutely love spicy food but would highly recommend getting one level lower rate than you usually get medium is a sinus cleanse for sure! I had a real easy time getting my Thai tea with coconut milk instead of dairy since I do not eat dairy."}
{"text":"Don't let this restaurant's strip mall or small size fool you. The food here is FANTASTIC, as is the service. A fair warning to newcomers, however...their spice levels are a fair bit spicier than other Thai places in the valley"}
{"text":"I have tried on multiple occasions, various owners, and both locations that Krua Thai Cuisnine have occupied, and still find they miss the mark when it comes to consistency, flavor, and authentic flavors. As is often with ethnic foods in America that are aimed at those who may have never left our borders, the flavors have one thing in common, sweetness. Sugar seems to be the common glue that tricks the unsophisticated palate into thinking a food is great. Krua Thai conforms to this method of preparing dishes. Consistency in preparation is also missing. True, many a chef will modify a recipe taking advantage of seasonal fresh veggies or substitute when a particular ingredient may be hard to find such as Thai Basil or Kaffir Lime but to not follow the very recipe as it has been printed in their menu, missing common items, not just once, but again and again, this does not bode well for repeat visits. 

If you do in fact find yourself still curious, the dishes marked spicy are only indicators that they can be made spicy, do not forget to ask for them to make your dish with chili otherwise your salty sweet dish will not have a hint of heat."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent and I finally found a Thai food restaurant where \"Thai hot\" is really at a level of spice that truly lives up to the definition. I've never had a bad dish here and the quality of Krua Thai is always consistent. I highly recommend it for the Thai food fan."}
{"text":"0 Stars. 
Horrible service. 
Food was okay but took forever for take-out. Plus, when I paid they told me they didn't have the propper change and then tried to short me."}
{"text":"What a great little place. Had the Pad Thai Noodles with chicken and medium heat for lunch. The little bowl of soup I had looked unassuming and was a fantastic blend of flavor. I usually just look and take a bite of egg rolls as they are usually just not my thing AGAIN these were great. and The noodles were perfect. best meal in a long time for such an out of the way little place. We will go back!"}
{"text":"excellent Tom Yum and Tom Kha and Panang Curry. You can get your dish very hot. Hotter than anywhere else I've ever been. Also they have this spice mix on the table that is delish and can easily increase the heat. Service is great. Only drawback would be there are very few tables so don't go at peak dining hours."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai take out place, and that's not an easy feat to accomplish. 

I've ordered most of their curries, and all of them are delicious. All the reviews are spot-on, they take their spice levels seriously! If you can handle a great amount of heat, then you'll definitely love this place as much as everyone else. 

They're great about accepting orders even if it's near closing time, and their employees are also superrr nice"}
{"text":"Service was attentive, warm, and welcoming. 

Food was A-OK. 

I ordered green curry, which had the punch to it but lacked in flavor. 

I would come back and try other dishes."}
{"text":"I don't have the same experience that the majority of Yelpers have had on here, which disappoints me. A couple of years ago I got some takeout of pad se ew and summer rolls and I wasn't impressed. With their recent move and the positive reviews I gave them another shot. I ordered yellow curry takeout style. The flavor was decent but the curry was super watery - bummer as I like them a bit thicker. Also, I asked if I could get some spicy sauce to go with a side of noodles. The hostess said that wasn't an option the noodles were just steamed. I said no worries, can I just get something on the side to add (chili sauce maybe?!) she said no. Wait, what? You don't have a spicy sauce to add to some noodles at a Thai restaurant? I'll drive a little farther next time I need some Thai."}
{"text":"Great restaurant and food.  The flavor was good on everything we had, but spicier than other Thai restaurants we've been to for the same level (ex. medium was pretty spicy at this place while others were a little milder).
I had this place on my bookmark to try for a while and glad that we finally did go.  And it was not disappointing, so I am sure we will return."}
{"text":"Deliciousness, satisfaction and pocket friendly. We love everything apart from the fact that they hardly accept take out orders over phone after 8 pm. But we don't mind to drive to get this much awesomeness."}
{"text":"Awesome Thai restaurant!!! First time there and was surprised at how good the food was! The soups are amazing and service was great. Will definitely be back on a weekly basis :)"}
{"text":"I found this place a few months ago and fell in love. The food is great, the atmosphere nice and I enjoy coming back. My favorite is simple, yellow curry chicken, but I have ventured into some of the other dishes. Love it and recommend it."}
{"text":"Excellent food! I ordered the sweet and sour chicken and it was incredibly delicious. The service was also excellent. I highly recommend going here!"}
{"text":"Was my favorite place for curry the #40 on the menu they use coconut milk as a base for the sauce but greed seemed to take over and the sauce was very watered down taste like curry powder with water very little to no coconut milk my girl agreed then the next day my brother went and said the same thing, Gotta find a new curry place."}
{"text":"This place's been here forever. The food is always good. We ordered beef salad and stir fry basil with pork. Very tasty. Kick ass hot for medium heat. Wow."}
{"text":"I tried this place because of the great reviews on Yelp.... But, I don't know why people are raving about this place. Maybe I went there on an off day because my food was lacking flavor and my Tom Yum soup was luke warm without any lemon grass. Tom Yum soup is known for having a hot & sour lemon flavor to it and the soup had none of it.  My Pad Thai noodles where like something out of a box (Aunt Chens Pad Thai) that you buy at the super market.  My yellow curry with chicken wasn't so yellow, lacking that most important ingredient of coconut milk. So I have to give this place 1 star and I won't be back!"}
{"text":"This was first time here. Our waitresses was horrible. We don't eat thai food often. We needed assistance on ordering food. We got the wrong meal. After we complained and got the correct meal, a cockroach came out the soup. The waitress still wanted to charge me for the appetizers. ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?

We will NEVER go back there!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular to this place. But this time Krua thai disappointed us big time. We ordered Pad Kee Mao, Yellow curry and Vegetable Fried rice. Everything was asked to be made medium spicy. The Pad Kee Mao that came out was terribly spicy and it was getting very difficult to even eat a single strand of noodle. We requested to modify the dish and make it less spicy and the dish that came up was even more spicier. 
Terrible experience to say the least."}
{"text":"I did a pick up order for the red curry with chicken and shrimp rolls. The red curry chicken is amazing. I've had it twice now. The o key reason I gave four stars is because I asked for the shrimp rolls and instead got to vegetable egg rolls. Kinda disappointing when I opened up my bag at home. Check your food before you go to make sure it's right. But other than that, they have delicious food."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the other reviewers are talking about unfortunately. Went here starving one day looking forward to an amazing Thai dinner bailed on all the previous reviews. I was excited and in the mood for Thai. Ordered the crispy tofu, tom kha with shrimp, pad tai and red curry with pork.... The whole meal was essentially uneatable. All I could taste in the soup and curry was cream something sweet and lotsa salt. The steamed rice was good but that's about it. When I peaked in the kitchen I saw an older Asian lady so I thought it was gonna taste good however I was severely dissapointed.  I don't know if I just got the wrong stuff or  the ol lady was having an off day or what. But suffice to say we hit five guys on the way home I was so sad."}
{"text":"This place was 90% full on a Friday evening. It was very busy the whole time we were there, but the place was just large enough that customers didn't have to wait for a table. It was a great cycle. 

Though it was busy, and the little lady that took our order seemed to be very busy, she was very quick and very nice. She even came back a few times to ask about our food and such. Every one we encountered was very nice! 

Tried the Pad Se Ew, medium spicy, and it was very good. It got to the point where it got a little too salty for me. My fiance ordered the massaman curry, medium spicy, and that was two thumbs up! SO good! My friend ordered Pad Thai and that was good too. 

The ambiance was great! The restaurant is very bright and clean. 5 stars for that and service. 
4 stars for the food - good food but not the best I've had. 

Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"First time here! We ordered a Papaya salad to start off it tasted really good! Then we ordered a Tom yum seafood combo came out very good, the mushrooms and the spice was on point! Then for our main dish we got a yellow curry pineapple duck  it had a great sweet and spicy to it! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"It is a sad day when I have to take stars away from one of my most beloved spots in the area.

I came here for a family dinner, ordered my regular chicken satay and tried out the garlic lovers beef entrée. My stepmom ordered a specialty dish ($13.50), which consisted of vegetable, cashews, and fried fish, sitting in so much liquid it was overflowing. Now, typically fried fish shouldn't be swimming in sauce because it will become soggy. It became soggy, and after a piece and a half she could no longer eat it, and I chose to share my dish with her. The rest of the food was delicious and we licked our plates clean as usual with the exclusion of the fish dish! We explained the situation to our waitress, about how the meal was inedible, barely could eat it, and requested that it be removed from the check. So she came back and said if you have any questions about the check you will need to talk to my manager. So, we noticed it was not removed and requested to talk to her. She grabbed someone (not the manager) who said we would need to speak to the manager. So we requested her once again. She came out of the kitchen finally. She refused to comp a 13$ entrée on a bill that was over $60.00. We  visit this place 2-3 times a week with sizeable checks, so it is a shame that $13 could not be covered through good customer service. She ended up yelling at my dad in both English and a foreign language in front of all the other patrons. 

Maybe I am accustomed to manager comping or discounting meals when it is unsatisfactory. Time to look for a new thai place! :("}
{"text":"The food is exquisite. The service is horrible. They do not know how to treat customers properly. I went there for business lunch and we were not allowed to sit where we could conduct our business. I have been there several times and each time I have found the waiters to be lacking courtesy. But I will go there for carry out."}
{"text":"Only grading this place by appearance as we stopped by for pick-up around 7:30pm on a Monday Night.  The place was very clean, modern, the food smelled fabulous and was absolutely packed."}
{"text":"Yum! We were in the area and came in as soon as it opened. Attentive and friendly service from the adorable waitress. I ordered my standard pad thai with tofu and it was delicious. I chose a hot spice level, and it was definitely hot. I enjoy spicy foods and I can handle them, but this made me short of breath and it was awesome. The lunch special is a really good deal and it comes with a soup and a spring roll. We got our food very fast, probably because we were the first customers. I'd come back for sure! Nice ambience too, and by the time we left and hour later the small place was full. Glad we came early!"}
{"text":"This place is a great addition to our area. The Curry Panang and Green Curry is awesome, and the same goes for their apps. Really like this place!"}
{"text":"Lunch date with my hubby. Great lunch specials. Two Laughing Buddhas. I give this place 5 Phoenix Stars"}
{"text":"This is a great spot if you're in the area for a nice lunch special. $7.25 for a little soup, an egg roll and an entree. 

I had the pad Thai and it was really good. Nothing to make a journey from downtown Phoenix for, but nonetheless good. 

VERY IMPORTANT: THEY DO NOT MESS AROUND WITH SPICE. I'm generally pretty good about handling spice- but I went with the medium and my nose almost fell off. There is still a 'hot' and a 'Thai hot' above that! I could only can conclude that the only way out after a plate of 'Thai hot' pad Thai is on a stretcher. 

With that being said, I would order the mild and use the spice on the table (it's the same one they use back in the kitchen) to spice it up to your prefere"}
{"text":"I love this place. I've been coming here for years and I would recommend it to anyone. The new location is so nice! I've never been disappointed by any dish, but tonight I tried the Thai Chicken Salad and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"It was our first time eating at this restaurant last week and I think we will be back soon!
The place was small but neat - we arrived about dinner time (6pm) and there was a lot of customers but they manage to serve us quickly so other waiting customers can be entertained and seated right away. 

 We ordered the Chicken Satay, Pad Thai, Red Duck Curry and Crab Fried rice and everything was delicious! Our total bill was about $40 bucks but we had a lot of left over so I think it is worth your money."}
{"text":"Solid thai flavors in Phoenix. The service was friendly and food was great!! Tom kha soup delicious! Papaya salad tasted fresh and just the right amount of spice. Try the shrimp rolls for an appetizer-- nice and crispy. Thai tea was a yummy treat as well."}
{"text":"Krua Thai is basically the only Thai Restaurant we go to now and have been going to for years. The food is excellent, reasonably priced and the staff is great. The owner is super nice and always accommodating. The lunch menu is inexpensive and quick to serve"}
{"text":"Decided to check out this joint for my annual Christmas Eve Thai fest and soo happy that I did! Their curries were spicy and full of flavor and their spring rolls were delicious! I can't wait to come back and try more of their dishes. One of the more authentic Thai places I have found in Arizona!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service... We went there for lunch from office. After having us wait for 45 mins (the wait time said to us was 30 mins), we were not offered seating even after a table was free for 15 mins. When we enquired they said that table was for 6 and we were only 5 members. We would need to wait till a table for 5 becomes free. There were no 6 member groups waiting still they refused us the table. The waitress are least bothered about the customers. Even while ordering food they get irritated offer try to ask too many questions. We have decided never ever to go there again"}
{"text":"Food is excellent here.  We had chicken pad Thai and chicken with basil sauce (Thai hot and let me tell you, it was, comes with lots of sauce).

The one star less is because the service is ultra slow. We were seated almost immediately for lunch, the restaurant was packed but upon sitting, we waited at least 10-15 minutes before our order was taken. Then if you ask for anything at all, don't expect right away, expect to wait 2-3 minutes for extra napkins or lemons in your water.

I would suggest picking out your food and ordering upon being seated so you don't have to wait.

Bathroom: there is only one shared by both male and female, however, shockingly very clean and smells very nice, not gross.

Ambience: small but quaint, about 14-16 tables.

Pricing: awesome for lunch @ $7.25 for a lunch special menu, comes with a flavorful cabbage/veggie/tofu soup and a veggie egg roll with a nice sweet and sour sauce and of course white rice if you get a non noodle dish.

Overall-great place and great flavors."}
{"text":"Always love to go this place. Nice family owned restaurant and very good thai food and people too."}
{"text":"Thai food is one of my favorite cuisines. This is probably one of the top three Thai places I have eaten at in Arizona. The Pa thai, spicy fried rice, panang curry and pad se ew is usually what I get. They can make the food quite spicy so pick your level with caution. Food is absolutely delicious. The meat is extremely moist and not dried out like some of the other places that I have been to. 
I usually do take out but the restaurant has a casual atmosphere. The phone lines are busy in the evenings and hard to get thru. They do have some great lunch specials as well.

Would highly recommend if you live or work in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure about this place at first. Sitting next to a car lot, it has a very commercial, modern storefront look that did not exude the usual Thai restaurant atmosphere. Appearances can be deceiving and we have been back multiple times. I fell in love with the spring rolls and could make a meal out of them. My husband likes spice more than I do, so I am less adventuresome. The duck I had was wonderful but the folks at the next table were so enthused about their barbecue chicken I was almost ready to ask for a taste. So, next visit, I didn't need to look at the menu--I got that gorgeous chicken. Perfectly seasoned, moist and delicious, that is now my go-to meal whenever we dine there. When I find a really great dish at a restaurant I tend to order it again and again. I probably miss out on some other tasty dishes, but I don't want to be disappointed if it doesn't measure up to my idea of perfection. Yeah, I'm boring but will continue to order that chicken and I will not share the leftovers either!"}
{"text":"I am a die-hard spicy Pad Thai fan, I think I could eat it every single day. I pass this place constantly and dismiss it because it's in a sketchy-looking strip mall. After reading some great Yelp reviews, I gave it a try. I had the Pad-Thai at \"medium\" spice level. That was spicy! And I like spicy. Make sure to have a glass of milk or something on hand because it hurts so good. The amount of chicken/shrimp in the dish is scant, but I suppose at the price it makes sense. It's enough food for two full servings, no doubt. Overall it kind of lacked in abundance of ingredients besides noodles, of which there was an overabundance. Due to price and proximity to my house, I will eat there again. If you just want some cheap and tasty Pad Thai, it's worth it. If you're looking for a mind-blowing Thai food experience, this isn't it."}
{"text":"So good! I went here for lunch with my daughter. She likes spicy foods and I can't do very much spice. I ordered sweet and sour chicken which was very good! My daughter got spring rolls and something else, I can't remember lol. She liked her food as well and has been there before. The prices were reasonable, the service quick and friendly. There were quite a few people there which to me shows that the restaurant has a good track history. Overall a good experience and I would recommend."}
{"text":"Food good service is not. After sad down took over 7 min to get a waiter to order a drink"}
{"text":"Wow!  What a find!  The panang curry reminded me of some of the best stuff I had in London.  The pad thai was also above average and the mee krob was a unexpected treat!  The place is small and , as a result, was a bit packed, but well worth it.   We'll be going back and/or picking up take-out again!

Also, a word of warning -- they're closed on Sundays."}
{"text":"Ordered off the lunch menu (Monday-Friday 11AM-3PM): yellow curry with chicken ($7.50) and a Thai tea.

Location:
-strip mall. I hate restaurants in strip malls but I guess I'll make an exception
-easy to find
-ample parking, large lot

Food:
-yellow curry was good, tasted authentic, was made spicy per my request
-could have done with a little more rice
-large portion for lunch
-also comes with soup (this day's was veggie and tofu in broth, not very impressive) and a fried veggie roll (akin to an egg roll, very yum)

Service:
-was seated promptly, received the soup and egg roll quite quickly
-high turnover rate during the lunch hour, but every seat was still full; be prepared to get to know your neighbor
-employees were friendly and quick; helpful but not overbearing

Nice little stop for lunch or a casual dinner. I wouldn't call this \"fancy\" dining, but it definitely does the trick for this single lady on a quest for Thai food ;)"}
{"text":"Sweet, Sweet, Sweet! 

Tom Yum soup (supposed to be hot and sour) that was inedible, sickeningly sweet; threw it out.   

Why do Thai restaurants in Phoenix think that they have to serve such sweet food?! Tragic.

Nothing was even slightly spicy. 

Ordered: 
Tom Yum Soup with shrimp
Yum Woon Sen Salad
Pad Se Iew
Pad Prik King with Beef

All sweet, no heat. 

So much to pick at, won't be returning."}
{"text":"Krua Thai serves good thai food if you happen to live north of Phoenix.  We ordered lunch portions of Stir Fry  Green Chilli, Sweet Basil (with Tofu), Spicy Fried, and Garlic Chicken and all dishes turned out well made and were well presented. Service was efficient, quick and lunch portions are priced very reasonably.  

One word of advice though: When you order your entree \"hot\", it is made very spicy(hot). You will certainly start sweating. Mild and medium levels of hotness should sit well with most people. 

Will definitely come back and try their dinner menu."}
{"text":"Tried for the first time. My husband and I absolutely love Thai food but the service at this place is awful. We had a good waiter but long wait time for them to even get to your table so you can order. The employees don't know their left hand from their right hand..we won't be going back! Food was alright though!"}
{"text":"Krua Thai never disappoints. I'm a sucker for delicious curry and this is definitely my go-to spot for it! I guess I'm a little biased, since I have never had any of their non-curry dishes. But I will say that they're crab fried rice is suuuuuperb!!! That, the Thai tea, and a curry dish are a staple when I dine here."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in town. Same level of consistency every single time on the items ( Spicy Fried rice, chicken satay, panang curry, Tom yum soup etc...) we order every time."}
{"text":"Excellent!
service was good/friendly, not overbearing but attentive.
I ordered the lunch special, actually 2 cuz i thought they would be tiny lunch portions like most places do, but when they came out they were \"regular\" size and super freakin delicious! Ended up taking 1/2 of each home for later!
GREAT FOOD/SERVICE/PRICE
Wish they'd open one up closer to queen creek!"}
{"text":"Everything about the cuisine from the rice to the main entrees is amazing. Try any curry and you will not want to get Thai food anywhere else. The service is spot on, I am very happy that the restaurant is having so much success after changing locations."}
{"text":"This is a great little mom and pop place.  They are attentive and service is great.  The lunch specials are awesome.  Their daily soups are always on point.  Their egg rolls are savory and not too greasy.  The only gripe I have is that they don't do panang curry or pad see ew on their lunch specials."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends from work and they have a great lunch special that comes with a lot of sides and a large portion of many Thai favorites. This place is a hidden gem and I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Have become a regular here because of  \"the best soup in the world\" as I say.... Also, they have a great mango and sticky rice dessert.  Got some panang curry.   and although I hate green bell peppers, I would just ask for them not to be in there next time.  The curries are very good.  And they have the wonderful Thai coffee I like so much that's like creamy rocket fuel.  It is super clean, and the people who work here are obviously a family and are lovely people."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food I've found in Phoenix, and I've been to Thailand several times. Spice level \"hOt\" is just right. My nose is running :-) Green curry has great crunchy veggies, Thai tea is nice and lunch specials are under $10."}
{"text":"We tried for a second time after the first takeaway was so hot we couldn't eat it; the reviews were good so we made sure we clearly told them the spice levels we wanted. HO had Pad Thai and I had Kang Pa, which was a mistake as I like a thick curry sauce, but it was still delicious. HO2 had mild curry. Overall it was very good and tons of food!
Will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, clean, nice ambience, and  best of all yummy food.

They have plenty of Vegetarian options. Almost everything can be made veggie with tofu or assorted vegetables. I have gotten the Crispy Egg Noodle, Pad Thai, Red curry, Sweet Basil and the Spicy Cashew Nut. All have been amazing dishes with lots of flavor. I loved Thai sweet basil so much that I have now started using it in my asian dishes at home. So thanks for introducing me to that. It's not sweet per say (I was thinking sugar sweet at first) but very fragrant. 

Be careful with SPICE levels. I once ordered medium accidentally and it was really spicy for me. You can always add more hot sauce/ red peppers from the table to add extra spice if needed.

Thai iced tea is good, but not the best I have had. I don't recommend getting the pad thai here, didn't like it much"}
{"text":"A friend introduced me to this place, and that is one reason I still have love in my heart for them! This place rocks! It's a small family owned place and very authentic Thai! My husband and I are addicted to Thai food and test them by our favorites, Chicken Larb and Panang Curry. We have not yet found a place comparable to this. They recently moved from a hole in the wall to a nicer larger establishment. Beware, medium is hot so be prepared. Fortunately, we like hot food! For inexpensive for the quality and size of the portions."}
{"text":"This place is so damn delicious that whenever my friends get Thai without me we call it \"Thai Cheating\". I have eaten at 4 Thai restaurants in the valley and the flavors at this place are superior. 

P.S. When they say HOT they mean it."}
{"text":"From the moment you walk in and hear the soft sounds of a small waterfall drowning out the roar of the cars outside. Now ambiance of steady healthy kitchen sounds among the comfortable conversations of happy clients fill your ears. 
My wife and I came here for the first time and were  impressed. The building was sound proof to the busy bell road and as we took in the sights through the windows under the comfortable feel of the lanterns above, we were enjoying a moment of peace. The pineapple curry with roasted duck was exquisite. I have had curry from all around the world and this was truly a flavorful and pleasant taste. For dessert we finished up splitting a sticky rice in the shape of a little bear. My wife adored it but I loved eating the little legs. I felt a little like Farquad from Shrek. As cruel as the thought of eating gingey's legs is, the sticky rice was not in any way unpleasant. It was my first experience with sticky rice and we loved every grain of it. We will be back, and just being around the corner from our home makes it all the more appealing. Please eat here and enjoy this mom and pop shop; I hope you like it as much as we did."}
{"text":"I'm debating between 3 and 4 stars. Because Krua is located near our home I'm sure we'll be back. That being said, the food was good not great. We started out with the mee krob. We never had mee krob and didn't like it. The shrimp were heavily battered. I ate 2 before I knew what was lurking under all that batter. 

The panang curry with chicken was average. The best panang  I've ever had was from Sticky Rice in Chicago and I compare every panany curry to that. Right or wrong, it's what I do.

My husband had the combo fried rice. His dish lacked flavor, the rice was mostly white and they were skimpy on the meat and shrimp. I liked my dish better than his. I just read in another review that Krua is BYOB. We will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Must try red thai curry and spicy fried rice. After trying for more than 10 times everytime the same quality."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch alone.  There were plenty of open tables (at least five I saw), yet I was told 10-15 minute wait.  I passed."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Thai places. I recently discovered it after driving by it so many times. So so sooo good. 

Each time I have been there I've gotten the hot pot soups; vegan, of course. And each time I loved it. The hot and sour is hot and sour. It comes with a variety of veggies that are cooked enough but with a little texture. The tom kha is creamy and flavorful. The coconut milk meshes so well with the veggies. The rice is delicious. My friend loved her beef Thai basil and even tho it was very non vegan of me, I tried the juices from her dish with rice and it was delicious! 

Prices are decent. Little higher than some other Thai places I've eaten at. But obviously quality is a factor in pricing. 

This is definitely my new favorite Thai place to eat it. The only thing is their service is sub par. Oh and their wait can get long but no complaints because it's always busy and thats a good thing."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place and usually eat here every couple/few weeks. I always get the Red Curry and the Chicken Satay. The Thai Tea is really good as well. Food is reasonably priced and the portions are pretty big/filling. You definitely get your moneys worth."}
{"text":"Very flavorful food, maybe a little on the salty side. Food display was appetizing. Area was clean. Service was quick. However, we stayed a couple minutes past closing time and was promoted how many Togo boxes we wanted. Understandable but I thought that was a little unprofessional and rude. But overall, good food and quick service."}
{"text":"Everything from appetizer to desert has been amazing. I love veggie rolls, tom kay and  the curry noodles. The curry noodles I need at least once a month but if I could I would have it once a week, it's just that good."}
{"text":"Ok while I am giving this place a 5, it is solely because of it's never disappointing/ out of this world amazing thai food. I have been here 4 times now and am always satisfied after finishing a meal. The large coconut soup is a great size to split and keeps the hunger for the rest of the food at bay. I LOVE spicy food, BUT if you order hot be prepared to have a cleansed sinus system and a million chemicals of seratonin to be released. Their panang curry chicken sauce is so good I could order sauce amd drink it like soup. The Pad Kee Mao is also delightful. For lunch i've ordered the pad thai noodles and the thai beef salad (hot)! Wooow-system cleared and happy level raised. Mix these dishes together and you will be a happy soulful version of your old busy self. However, as all of this food is out of this world their service is not. What happened to making sure there was a fork before dropping the food, nevermind I'll grab it off another table myself. Let's improve on the steps of service please, but as you can see this has not stopped me from coming back for more!"}
{"text":"It was a huge let down. One of our friend who lives in Scottsdale praised this restaurant to heavens. We were a family of five went on a week day for lunch. The place was not busy, hence seated promptly.
The waitress seem to understand very little English. Even for water order (some with and some without ice), she repeated at least 4 times. Then came lunch order. Specifics of the dish were given along with one dish for an elderly person as \"very mild\"
The so called soup was a slop of vegetables in hot water. The food had very little authentic Thai taste. The food specifically ordered as \"very mild\" turned out to be inedible as it was way too hot. To make matters worse, my food was heavy with salt. 
Cooking is an art. Some people make it perfect, others just \"make it\" After having traveled all across the globe and tasted various types of food, it makes one wonder how do some of these restaurants survive. Are the praises real? One thing every cook knows in never salt the food too much. You can always add it, but can never be able to take it out. Ditto for spices. 
Some of my memorable Thai food places come to my mind are one located on Main Street in Scottsdale, Nana Thai in Marietta GA etc. 
Repeat vist? NOOOOO."}
{"text":"My lovely wife and I recently supped at Krua Thai Cuisine (1601 East Bell Road, Suite A11, Phoenix, AZ 85022). We feasted on the Tom Yum Soup with Shrimp (hot and sour soup, blended with chili paste, lemon grass, kaffir lime leaves, cilantro, green onions, mushrooms and fresh lime juice), Papaya Salad (traditional salad made with papaya, carrots, green beans, tomato, lime juice, palm sugar, fish sauce, peanuts and fresh cabbage), Shrimp Salad (blanched shrimp with fresh lettuce, lemon grass, red onions, green onions, and cilantro, mixed with chili paste and lime dressing) and a side of steaming-hot Jasmine rice. The owners, who we have known for many years, treated us to a delicious dessert of home-made Coconut Ice Cream. This restaurant is, undoubtedly, the cleanest eatery I have ever been to. The staff is very friendly and welcoming. Parking is readily available."}
{"text":"Just when I felt I was missing the tasty food from Bangkok garden from Salisbury NC - Krua Thai came to my rescue.. The place is wonderfully located with nearly stores not opened during dinner time. Food was better and waiting to try more than all the 'colored' curries. Very neat places always pull me again and again, this place is one of the good places to go back to. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Not only was the food excellent, but the owner overheard us tell the waitress that it was our first time there and he picked up our check. Now that is customer service-and the start of customer loyalty.
Please check it out!"}
{"text":"Thai spicy is real deal, not Americanized Thai that so many try to pass off as authentic"}
{"text":"This is our first stop in ARIZONA and it's a hit. Food was amazing, people are great and the line is out the door. Make sure you come before 12 or you will have a wait about 20minutes"}
{"text":"What an awesome place. A hole in the wall in a strip mall on 16th street and Bell Road. Very clean place with prompt and courteous service. Had the Chicken Satay ($7.95) with Peanut Sauce as an appetizer. Grilled perfect. The Tom Yum (Hot and Sour) soup had such a fresh taste from the lemon grass and lime. As it cooled, the flavors melded and transformed, also getting a little spicier with each bite. A small bowl fed two people ($4.50.) Next up, entrees. We shared a Krua Thai Rama, which is Stir-fried chicken in spicy peanut sauce served over a bed of lettuce. This was $8.95. The flavor was incredible but there was just a bit too much sauce. Mixing rice in with it helped. The last thing we tried was out of this world amazing. Chicken and Shrimp Pad Thai. We got everything with \"Medium\" spice which was perfect. We eat a lot of spicy food and medium was just a a great temp. The Pad Thai also was $8.95. We ended up bringing home half of each entree for lunch. This will definitely end up on our list of places to take friends for dinner. On our way out we glanced in the kitchen and it appears they also make their own noodles!"}
{"text":"We have been regulars here for years. When they first opened I think I mentioned the food was a little oily. Must have been random bad luck. 

The food here is delicious!!  You couldn't ask for a better neighborhood Thai spot. Nothing fancy just delicious food, always perfectly prepared, and really nice people here. We used to live really close and ate here once a week. Now that we live 12 miles away we still come here regularly. Our favorite Thai place around, hands down. 

Favorites are still Tom Kha Gai, veggie rolls and SpicyCashew Nut Chicken."}
{"text":"I just got food poisoning from there. Service was good food tasted good. I had the sweet and sour chicken. #L15."}
{"text":"Small and simple but the food was excellent we ordered the sweet basil shrimp and green curry with chicken"}
{"text":"3.5 Stars.

This place had better than average Thai, and btw average Thai is not worth having.  I had what I usually have at Thai places I've never been to before:  Pad Thai & Satay. That's generally safe when you don't know the restaurant.  Like I said, better than average-I'd go back if I'm in the neighborhood again and try something else."}
{"text":"Food is excellent, but it's difficult to order takeout when no one answers. I've called several times and get no answer on a Saturday evening. This is the second weekend I've had that problem."}
{"text":"Still 5 stars and my favorite Thai restaurant.  I was here recently for lunch after not visiting for a very long time and my word, it was so busy!  I was there by 11:30 on a Thursday and every table was taken with a group of people waiting at the front to be seated.  My original intention was to eat there but I quickly realized that I would not have time as I need go to back to work.  I ended up ordering to-go and was able to leave in under 10 minutes after placing the order. 

I always knew this place would be packed during lunch but was not expecting it to be completely full so early.  My advice is to be there right as they open at 11am or very shortly afterwards to get seating.  Otherwise, order to-go or extend your lunch if you are coming in from work.  

I ordered my usual chicken pad thai lunch and it's the same as I've always remembered it; incredibly delicious, filling, and well... perfect."}
{"text":"What a great place! They had a table ready when we walked in and filled up quickly. The lunch menu had a lot of great options with fair prices. The chicken fried rice was great! My boyfriend ordered a cashew chicken dish in hot and was impressed that it really had heat to it. The only down side is that soda is per can rather than unlimited fountain. Service was  quick and friendly.  We are excited to have this place so close!"}
{"text":"My first time here, last night.  My sister and I split a noodle soup with chicken.  And for our entree, we ordered Panang with tofu and vegetables.  Everything was delicious.  We went to order extra rice, because the first bowl didn't turn out to be enough, and the 2nd bowl, with an extra charge of $1.75, was much larger than the first.  

They apparently do a very good \"take-out\" business, as people kept coming in to either pick-up, or place their order, and wait.

I will definitely come back.  The restaurant is attractive, and very comfortable."}
{"text":"You will either relate to this review or you won't.  My guess is most won't, given the 4 star average review that originally seduced me and my wife into eating here.

If you're perusing Yelp thinking to yourself, \"There aren't many good Thai restaurants in Phoenix, and I just don't trust Yelp reviews.  4/5 star reviews always let me down\" and \"This place has 4 stars, I wonder if it's truly a 4 star Thai restaurant or if it's people that haven't had amazing Thai food\" - keep on reading.  

I don't consider myself a Thai food snob.  We like good food but we are not hung up on authenticity.  This night's meal was beyond a total let down though.

Tom Yum.  The Thai soup staple.  Like, how can you make terrible Tom Yum?  Even when it's bad it's not so bad, right?  Wrong-O.  This Tom Yum was so bad, it was inedible.  I don't throw away food, but tonight's meal the soup went into the trash.  Sickening, disgustingly sweet.  Mushy (as in possibly spoiled) shrimp.  The soup was so sweet that it tasted like sweet and sour soup.  Look, I get the Thai juxtaposition of sweet flavors against salty, fish sauce vs. palm sugar, etc.  This was not that.  I'd like to think something went seriously wrong with the recipe tonight.  Forget not putting straw mushrooms, galangal, or lime leaf (which none was in the soup), this was like straight Tom Yum paste, shrimps, sliced button mushrooms, and half of a friggin' sugar bowl.  

Pad See Ew.  Flavorless.  Skimpy portion.  Dry chicken.  Pei Wei's Thai noodles probably would have been a better option.

Yoon Sen Noodle Salad.  Served hot (should be a cold glass noodle salad) - flavor was not bad but nothing like what the dish is supposed to be.  Should be sour with some heat.  We basically got a hot sweet noodle salad without any of those flavors.

Some other stir-fry.  Oily, sweet.  Not spicy.  Dry meat.  

Look, I can't blame Krua Thai completely.  They are just making a crappy version of Thai food for the sweet \"orange chicken\" and \"General Tso's\" craving American palate.  I get that many Thai restaurants sweeten things up.  But holy basil, this was way overboard, and frankly it was disgusting.  We tried to break out some fish sauce to salt the food to counteract the overabundance of sugar without much success.  

I have hope that one day there will be decent Thai food in Phoenix.  After trying most of the restaurants here, I've all but given up.  This experience tonight was really the bottom of the pack."}
{"text":"Amazing Thai food ! 
Delicious but BEWARE Thai spicy is no joke.
Order green curry Thai spicy and found habanero peppers. Amazingly good but to spicy"}
{"text":"First time here on my birthday and the food was super delicious. Loved the pad Thai & Tom yum soup. Best birthday dinner."}
{"text":"I wouldn't come here. The food is way too salty. I had the shrimp salad and it was horrible. The sauce on the shrimp was not tasty and the shrimp was warm when on the salad it's much better cold. They also charge gratuity AFTER the tax when that's apparently illegal. A party next to us was charged their gratuity after the taxes amount and the guy had to fight it to be taken off. The owner said that that's how it's always been done. But the guy was like well that's illegal! Overall service is great but the food is a disappointment. Way too salty."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant and get take out at least once a week. While the Panang Curry and their summer rolls are my favorite, I've enjoyed everything on the menu. They use exceptional quality ingredients. Staff is always friendly. I love spicy food, but even I have to be careful. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food is always fresh,  consistent and flavorful. The ladies that work here are so sweet and their service is always fast. The establishment is very clean, including the bathroom. Huge bonus! One of our favorite spots for date night."}
{"text":"I have referred everyone I know to Krua-- no one else beats it, that's a fact. However, after their move down the street, it seems as if their customer service has gone downhill as well. I called to place an order to go 20 minutes before closing, the employee condescendingly responded \"you'd have 15 minutes to get here\".... uh, duh! I work right across the street. 

Hopeful that they'll make a turnaround, excellent food though!!!"}
{"text":"I have gone here twice. My first experience was decent. The food was good but fairly pricey for the amount you get. The second time I was here we came in on the tail end of their lunch time special. The server seated us and pointed out their lunch specials. The servers were very slow taking our drink orders and by the time they got back to us to take our food order it was 8 minutes past their lunch special time and would not let us order any lunch specials... so why initially offer this deal to us if only to take it away due to your slowness? So we took our drinks to go and left. I will not be coming back again due to their poor customer service. There are plenty of other Thai restaurants around with great food great prices and larger portions."}
{"text":"Let's face it, good Thai food in Phoenix is very difficult to come by. Krua Thai is simply really good food for the price. We've both dined in and had take-out from this place.  The soups, curries and noodle plates have all been reliable and tasty, with generous portions and seemingly fresh ingredients.  Another plus about this place is that they don't over pepper the food like so many other Thai restaurants. Service is polite and very fast, too.  Not much not to like about this place,  Despite that this is a nondescript \"hole in the wall\" restaurant in a strip mall way out on Bell Rd, I think it's worth a special trip for those interested in good Thai food."}
{"text":"The new location is great with more space and a nicer dining room. The food was great as always."}
{"text":"Total of three small shrimp in my very soupy shrimp panang. I had my order door dashed to me and the dasher showed up with the bags leaking everywhere. Not impressed. Probably the worst Thai I have had in the area."}
{"text":"Very nice food and good service. Never got disappointed whenever I visit this place. A must visit for Thai food lovers. Also all the items are reasonably priced. Lunch includes soup and vegetable roll also."}
{"text":"Really solid Thai restaurant in the area - food has been great every time, and service is friendly and quick. I've come here multiple times for their great lunch special - your choice of a couple of dishes (either curries w/ rice, noodles, veggies) which comes with a spring roll, dipping sauce, and a cup of soup. So far I've had the pad Thai, as well as the yellow curry - both with chicken. I love the soup they have here as well - it's very simple, but good. If you do not tolerate spiciness well, I highly recommend to go with the mild. I decided to get medium my last time there and it already had quite a quick to it! If you're reading this though and rolling your eyes at my weak tolerance to spiciness, there is a \"Thai Hot\" level you can get, which is SURE to satisfy your kick. Overall, I would definitely recommend it as a solid Thai food option in North Phoenix; lunch specials are also only $7.95, making it a fantastic deal."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place!  We have to bring our children or listen to their crying.  NEW location opened approx 2 months ago. Same great food, same great service!  You can't go wrong with the Pad Thai, fried rice, and curry dishes.  Not sure about the previous (negative) reviews, but I can say without reservation, this place is fabulous for dinner- with or without children!  We are transplants from the East Coast and every restaurant is a hit or miss.  This place reminds us of the fantastic cuisine of Chinatown, Philly.  Don't take my word for it, come in and experience it for yourself.  If not, you're missing out."}
{"text":"Great Thai food.  Super spicy if you like it that way..  And I do.

Service was friendly and the portions were huge..  Enough for dinner and lunch the next day.."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and very efficient!  Love the summer rolls and the Tom Yum soup shrimp.   Medium is hot.  Don't go any higher than hot!  Friendly staff and convenient location.  The prices are a little steep for North Phoenix.  The food is great!"}
{"text":"This small establishment has become my favorite Thai place in north Phoenix. Food is always wonderful and quick. Service is good as well. Prices are very reasonable. Larb is my favorite appetizer and the curries are quite delicious. I would recommend ordering medium level of spice. The Thai Ice Tea with cream is yummy too."}
{"text":"I have always been hesitant to try Thai food, but this place was recommended by a few friends and it is right down the street from my house. One day I was craving some spicy noodles, so I decided to give it a shot. 

The girls working were very nice and asked me what I like and made a few recommendations. When they asked if I wanted it Thai hot, I said sure (i had no idea!). It wasn't until another girl working advised me that probably wasn't a good idea and she said maybe hot hot. I said sure again. They were quick to make my food and even offered me a water while I waited.

My only tip of advice is that even hot hot, is like fire in your mouth. I love spicy food but I was regretting my decision a few bites in!"}
{"text":"I just got a negative \"compliment\" from someone I assume at Krua Thai.. accusing me of being a fake reviewer. Wow! so even though there are multiple reviews here pointing out their horrible service, they choose to harass customers! I will post the screen shot"}
{"text":"Great little Thai place! They only have about 8-10 tables but the service is fast and the food is very good. Prices are about average for a Thai restaurant. The service is friendly as well. I take my teenage sons here usually about once per month and we enjoy it each time."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai Food!  Found this place in a strip mall and couldn't have been more surprised. This is a hidden gem!  Had a variety of foods, chicken satay, tom ka, green curry and spicy fried rice and all were excellent.  Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"First time dining here.  Can for lunch on weekday.  Ordered the spicy fried rice with Tofu, medium spicy.  Spicy level was good. Color or rice was orange, more like what you would expect at a mexican restaurant.  Taste was not bad but I would try something else next time.  Service was fast. I would come back again, but give another dish a try.

Updated on 3-15-18
Went back to this restaurant with my family.  Service was prompt.  We are all vegetarians; waiter made some suggestions. Tried the soup which was delicious.  My husband ordered an eggplant dish which was too salty.  Everything else we ordered was great.  Kids liked it too.  Spice level was good. We will return here again.  Updated to 4 stars"}
{"text":"This is one of my go to spots when craving Thai food. The owners are nice and literally know all the items on their menu and there is almost 75 items to choose from. 

A few of my favorites are the spicy fried fish, Pad Thai with chicken or shrimp and the Tom Yum Soup. Their lunch specials are great and huge portions. For the lunch specials you are not able to choose options off the menu, so you really are just choosing your entree. 

I love the new place, it's bigger than the last with more space to move around. The place is kept clean and the service is great. 

I only wish this place was opened on Sunday. 

Whether you want to dine in or just grab a quick take out order this is a great spot to try if you like Thai food."}
{"text":"I don't know where to begin so I guess I'll start from the time we walked in! We came in the door and stood there for several minutes while the guy at the register stood there and said \"they'll seat you\", well we didn't know who \"they\" were since there was no one in the dining room (server wise) for a few minutes. So we finally get seated at our table and wait 15 minutes to get our order taken, while only 6 tables were seated at this time. 

I order, my wife orders and when the food came out my wife's was completely the wrong menu item so we flagged the server down and she starts arguing with my wife about what it is she said. Unfortunately for her she was absolutely wrong and arguing about it was not helping. So she puts the order in for the correct item and just gets this pissy/surly attitude with her and me since i had to correct her on the order.  

So on to my meal, I ordered #26 (funny how all Asian restaurants use numbers), called Thai Sweet and Sour (with Chicken added). It was the worst tasting, soggy and dreadful meal I've ever had. The tomatoes felt and tasted like they had been in the broth for days, and the cucumbers tasted like methanol smells! just disgusting!

I found it odd that everyone at the register area were white and only the servers were of Asian decent. So the server wouldn't bring us our check so I had to go up ask the same lazy guy that wouldn't seat us and when I went to complain about the gawd awful food and service, he completely ignored me as if he didn't hear a word I had said.  This is in my opinion just a bad restaurant that appears to have past its prime. The only good thing was the Lucky Buddha Beer!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came looking for Pad Thai, which we both ordered as a main dish.  The ambiance was very quaint and the service was prompt and kind.   I started with a salad with peanut sauce, and it was absolutely delicious. I ate the entire thing, which is rare for me with a salad.  The Pad Thai was not as good. The chicken was of a very low grade and did not have a good flavor. I was so put off by the chicken that I could not bring myself to try the shrimp in the dish.  The noodles had kind of a dirty taste with an odd flavor that is difficult to articulate.  Even the water had a strange rotten taste to it, so much so that I stuck with soda which came from a can.  If I went back, I would only get the salad.    We ended up getting burgers after we left since neither of us could stomach the pad thai."}
{"text":"When you're craving for Thai Food in the valley this is the place to go. Krua Thai is authentic, perfectly seasoned, legit Thai restaurant. 

Service is amazing, everybody's nice, and to top it all of, they moved to a new location that is so much better than their old one, their new place makes dine in an even better experience. 

The Thai Iced Tea and the Tofu appetizer is a favorite, I would also recommend their Pad Thai, Curry and the bbq chicken. Also, do not leave the plce without trying their sticky rice dessert. It is a must. 

P.S. Everything is made to order, and surely you'll enjoy every bite!"}
{"text":"I wish i could give them a negative star. Worst customer service. First they forgot to put coconut milk on top of mango sticky rice(to go order) and then when i called them to tell them about this they were just very rude so i took it back and they didn't even say sorry or anything. And throwing my order on the table and shes like here it is. Is this how u treat a customer? And honestly the food here is 2/5. Thai Basil is so much better. Never going back again."}
{"text":"Wish we had gone to our regular thai spot. Went with a group of 4 (Asians) and none of us really liked our food it was such a bummer. We left more than half the food on each plate and didn't ask for boxes. They added gratuity so we ended up paying 100 dollars for about 4 plates of food we didn't really enjoy. Bummed about this place!"}
{"text":"Got take out from here quite awhile ago and then again recently.  Great food at an even better price.  Their spice intensity is excellent.   It is a strip mall find Don't be dissuaded by outward appearances. The inside I'd clean and neat.
You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Don't forget this place has moved, it's just across the street though. We have to come here at least twice a month! Love, love, love this place. Only thing is -we are sad that they're closed on Sundays now. The fish cakes are amazing, if you've never had them give them a try, you won't regret it (even though the name is strange and I don't really like fish that much). We always get the chicken satay, as well. They are always more than willing to make any dish the way I like, and the servers are fantastic!"}
{"text":"We were a little disappointed with our selections.  I had duck with a sweet curry and a lot of veggies.  My wife had the same with seafood.  Her's was not as sweet and was better of the two.  I wish I would have tried the panang or green curry.  I have to say the spring roll was only OK as well.  not enough basil and cilantro.  Mostly just lettuce.  The place is cute and the service is very good."}
{"text":"We've been here enough times to give 5 stars for consistency in service and flavor. The service is great every time we go, and the dishes were on point every time. I really appreciate how knowledgeable the staff is on what items have fish/shrimp/oyster sauce because I have an allergy. The spice levels here are accurate each time, and I appreciate that. We've ordered multiple dishes at different levels (mild, medium, hot) and they each seemed to be on point. Some of the best Tom Kha I've ever had!!"}
{"text":"Love this place.   For being so small there food is absolutely amazing.   Best Pad Thai I've ever had.   Amazing curry.   And wonderful,  fast survive.  If you love Thai food you will love this place."}
{"text":"We went there for lunch, the food is alright but no service at all. I understand lunch time is busy, but at least come to check our table once. The server came to take our order once we sit, and he came to drop off the food, and then we never seen him. So we gotta go to the front and pay at the front."}
{"text":"OMG, not only did I fall in love with my boyfriend because of this food but we also moved to be closer!   
Now let me explain...I love Asian food and I also LOVE spicy food, but I had never been here...my boyfriend and I had only been dating a short while and I thought I had him figured out until he brought me here for lunch and not only introduced me to the most amazing food I have ever tasted but also introduced me to the owner and \"Head Chef\".  
I don't know if it was the spices creating endorphins or the realization that my man is an incredibly intellectual and cultured foodie that made me actually fall in love with him that day but we have gone back weekly ever since.  
We decided to move in together and I'm not going to say that the proximity was our only deciding factor but it WAS on the pros's list for sure!  
We love the Num Tuk (#14), the spicy rice, and the yellow curry.  You get so much food that we usually agree to only order 2 things each time but it is always a struggle to decide which two items to order because we can't even decide what our favorite is AND we also want to try something new each time...so our order is ever changing but we have NEVER been disappointed.  
Best Thia food I have ever experienced and in reality my favorite restaurant in town!
Don't miss the coconut ice cream."}
{"text":"We moved here from Portland  where there were many Thai restaurants and TYPHOON reins supreme. 

Ever since getting here, in April, we have tried many.  I am happy to say that Krua is the closest we have found yet as competition for Typhoon.  I would rate Typhoon a 5+.

We ordered take out from Krua tonight and had Panang Curry with chicken, Papaya Salad and Phad Thai which comes with shrimp and chicken.

The Panang Curry was excellent.  We ordered a side of sticky rice, but it really wasn't sticky rice, it was American white rice just cooked to be sticky. We ordered medium heat on it and I would say that it was medium as indicated.  

The Papaya Salad was also excellent. We had medium heat on that as well.

Finally we ordered Phad Thai,  Hot.  They have extra hot and Thai Hot which I will try next time, but the order we made was just right for being hot. The Phad Thai was perfectly cooked and had the right heat, but we felt it lacked flavor.

The wait staff were friendly and the restaurant was very clean when we went to pick up the food. Several families were there with kids.

I would rate this restaurant a 5 for friendly staff and cleanliness.  5 for large portion sizes, 3.5 for the Phad Thai and 4.5 for both the Panang Curry and the Papaya Salad.  3 for the sticky rice.

Overall a 4 and so far the best Thai we have found in Phoenix.  We will go to this restaurant again and am interested in trying some of the other items that people have raved about."}
{"text":"Wow....one of the first Thai food restaurant that make the food as spicy as you ask.    Really good flavor, red curry delicious, pad Thai fantastic.  But next ill order medium instead of hot...my mouth is still on fire...lol"}
{"text":"The curry here is second to none. I cannot get enough. The won sen soup is delicious as well. This place should be crowned best Thai in Phoenix if not all of Arizona!"}
{"text":"The food was great but missing some proper etiquette during dining.  It bothers me when I'm still eating and they start sweeping the. floor near my table and lifting the chairs over the nearby tables. I understand it's close to closing time but they should at least wait until the customers are done  
eating before cleaning up."}
{"text":"We absolutely loved it here! It was my husband and my first time here and from beginning to end it was a wonderful experience. Beautiful location and very clean. A huge menu!  Our waitress and servers were prompt and super attentive. I ordered the Pad Thai with chicken( in picture) which was unlike any other I've ever had and I must say I was pleasantly surprised. It had awesome flavors and also a sweetness to it that wasn't overpowering in the slightest. My husband ordered the pineapple curry with duck and it was another bomb choice! Filled with flavors and not too spicy. We really wanted to save room for their sweet sticky rice which at the first selectively super sticky bite it was a melt in your mouth DELIGHT! It came in the shape of a bear ( such a cute touch) and it will be one of the main reasons we will be back! One of the best desserts I've ever had. They recommended we try the coconut ice cream with it next time. We can't wait to come back and try more!"}
{"text":"Always looking for a good thai place where i travel and found it here! Really yummy food. And even better customer service. Satisfied! Definitely will stop by when I'm next in town."}
{"text":"Really good Thai food a bit on the spicy side but so delicious. My husband couldn't hang so now he learned his lesson not to order spicy next time. But this place was quick with a take out order and you get a lot of food. Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"Red curry and chicken satay!  Not great, but still good Thai food.  Everything is just pretty average here- the service, the building, and the food.  I heard you can bring your own booze though.  Which would be kind of cool."}
{"text":"I love Krua.  It is one of my favorite places to eat.  At one time their Spicy Fried Fish and Tom Yum Gai made its way to my plate about 3 times a week.  And their Thai Coffee and Coconut Ice Cream is absolutely delightful.  I have tried over half the menu and haven't had a bad meal yet.  The only reason I knocked off one star is there seemed to be some recipe changes, which I wasn't to happy about.  But regardless, this is some seriously good eats!"}
{"text":"Krua Thai had good food, large portions, decent service, and a very precise vegetarian/vegan friendly menu. All of the eggs and non-vegetarian ingredients were always listed out so that it made it very easy for one of my non-egg eating vegetarian friends to order. 

The lunch special is a really great deal - it comes with soup, spring roll and your entree. They also take their spice seriously, so a medium spicy might make you sniffle a little bit - which is great. I hate ordering medium spicy and having it be super mild. The restaurant is clean, bright and open. I'd be back often if it were closer to my office."}
{"text":"I have been dying to find mango and sticky rice in Phoenix, after extensive research I found Krua. So sad the rice was horrible which is the reason for the 2 stars. Mango was delicious, but very disappointed it was nothing like I've had before and did not come with coconut milk."}
{"text":"A cute Thai house that does a good job with their food! We went here with a group of 6, and they easily accommodated our party and were happy to split checks easily at the end. Delicious food and we didn't feel rushed to leave. One friend ordered the hottest spiciness level, and it was HOT (just FYI). I would definite come back by when I'm in the neighborhood and wanting some delicious Pad Ma Kuer (Thai basil eggplant)."}
{"text":"Food is great, beware of the spice levels! Much higher than usual Thai places, hot level was almost unbearable for me and I love spicy food.  Service is average.  Definitely a great place to try."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the red curry lunch special!  The Thai Tea is bomb!!!The people are nice the atmosphere is very calmimg! I will come back this place is sorth the 35  mins drive(coming from Tempe)"}
{"text":"Nice little place on Bell Rd. Friendly staff. Food was as authentic as it can be outside Thailand, especially in Phoenix. Generous portions. Clean place. Will go again..."}
{"text":"Love this neighborhood stop! It's now popping which makes me so happy for them and sad that my little Thai secret it out. The staff is great and food comes out pretty fast. 

Everything we've ordered has been amazing! Our favorites include the Curry Noodles, Yum Woon Sen, Pad Kee Mow, and Spicy Fried Rice. Just be aware of your spice level and what you truly can handle. I'd recommend starting with medium and moving your way up if necessary. I came in like a badass and ordered hot my first time, LOL nope. I usually stick to medium, sometimes even mild now as I value my tongue. My bf orders extra hot though and loves it."}
{"text":"Thai for me is one of those cuisines that can be hit or miss. I mean, any time you need to specify how spicy the food should be and they still typically under shoot doesn't get my respect. Krua Thai Cuisine at 16th Street and Bell, however, is the best I have had in a very long time.

The food was fantastic, there were great prices, and a lot of choices. I think we will be back often to give other dishes a try."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant. Food was great and now they serve alcohol. Our favorite new Thai restaurant"}
{"text":"The Tom Yum soup is NOT Tom Yum. It's ok, but it's definitely NOT Tom Yum. A more accurate name would be \"Hw?n læa ph?d\" (I used Google Translate to translate \"sweet and spicy\" into Thai). LoL. Anyway, as MANY others have pointed out here regarding the Tom Yum soup, it lacks any flavors of lemongrass, lime, galanga. Soup should be the easiest item on a menu and when a restaurant screws that up, or worse, changing it into something much easier to make that less discerning customers may not notice (due to lack of exposure to real Thai food), then to me that comes off as not having pride in one's food. The instant I tried it, I thought \"This is strange. Did they mix up our order?\""}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai food place! The owners are a older couple, very nice people. The food is consistent, and always fresh. I get spicy fried rice Thai hot, or chicken pho Thai hot. I wish I could eat there rt now!"}
{"text":"Krua Thai has changed its location and the new location is great. Bigger and better, way more relaxed feel. The location basically moves across the street. Food is still awesome."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's close to my apartment and the food is always good whether it's take out or dining in. The staff is always so nice too!"}
{"text":"nice to have a decent place nearby for Thai food. nothing special inside but the food is always fresh and well prepared. love no. 22 Tom Kha soup."}
{"text":"Great Thai food and great ambiance for a hole in the wall joint. The food has been consistent and much better than other Thai joints in the valley. The only drawback is that they do not serve fountain drinks so you pay a lot of money for one small can of soda. Stick to lunch specials if you plan to visit this joint since dinner is more expensive and literally serves up the same food minus the soup and egg roll."}
{"text":"I honestly can't say enough about this place! I grew up with a lot of Thai food and this is certainly among the best I've eaten. The food tastes amazing, and when you order things spicy, they are VERY spicy. I'm a huge fan of properly spicy quisine and this pleases me.
 Friendly service, clean bathrooms and a wonderful decor scheme. Need I say more?"}
