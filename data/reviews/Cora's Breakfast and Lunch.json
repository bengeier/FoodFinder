{"text":"It's an ok place. Quantities are greater than you really need. Menus are are in thick plastique like in all non de script restaurants. No reason to avoid this restaurant just no reason to go out of you way to go either.  Ordered an espresso an got a Demi tasse with no crema. They should not be selling this if they can't make it"}
{"text":"You'd think that a breakfast restaurant would use fresh cooked, thick bacon.  They served me that \"pre-cooked\" bacon that you get on burgers at fast-food places.  It was tiny and not tasty.  I don't remember getting that lousy bacon at Cora's in Ottawa.  Cora's is expensive for what you get. And their coffee isn't very good - it's very weak.  There are much better places for breakfast in the area and they are cheaper."}
{"text":"Average food that is expensive. Go here if nicely cut up under ripe fruit is what you crave. Terrible value for your money and the fact that there is line ups every weekend makes no sense at all. Go to Fran's down the street for better bang for your buck.

Service is good doe"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service, and an overall disappointing Cora's. 

Don't get me wrong, Cora's (in general) is one of the best breakfast places. However the one on Carleton is the WORST one I've ever been too. I've been here twice now. The first time, the food took a long time (the restaurant was not very busy) and one of the dishes was disappointingly sparse and looked nothing like the pictures (which is a major disappointment considering it's Cora's). 

The second time I came we waited over 15 minutes for someone to come take our order, once again the place was not busy. 

I usually highly recommend Cora's but I would highly recommend avoiding this one."}
{"text":"I went here with a few friends. It was ok. Nice and bright and cheery, very busy. Food took a while to get to us. Waiter was fine. Nothing really to complain about, food was decent, it looked pretty. But I wasn't so impressed that I would bother waiting in line to get in ever again. I think of better places for breakfast in the city."}
{"text":"I love this place for breakfast alot of fruit on the plate fresh canadian ...smothy strawberry banana  and my st lucia creps yummy raspberry alot of raspberry sweet cheese yummy try u will love it service fast friendly line up on the weekend during the week just fine try banana blast banana nutella yummy"}
{"text":"Love this place, everything on the menu is good. The service is great I just wish the place was bigger. The last time I tried to go there was a big lineup to get in.  This is the best place to go for breakfast or brunch."}
{"text":"If I could give less than one star it would be maybe a 16th of a star. The hostess was the only good thing about this place. The service was slower than maple syrup in January. My sisters meal was so bad she couldn't eat it toast with globs of butter that didn't melt because the toast was so cold and how do you make a poached egg that is cold and congealed. While my breakfast was a bit better it was nothing special. This was second time we have gone and been unimpressed!!  When we told the waitress the food was awful she just said sorry and walked away. Great customer service. I guess we need to find a new place!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to go to Coras for breakfast at 8 am,  nice and early, hoping the food would be fresh and awesome. Anyways we get there and know what we want already so we go to order it. The girl takes our order and my date asks if he can get an everything bagel on the side and she immediately responds with \"Uh, this isn't Tim Hortons, so like, no.\"

....what? 

Aside from the fact that Tim Hortons is DEFINITELY not the only place that carries everything bagels, a) why are you so rude to your customers, and b) b*tch, it REALLY could pass as fast food with the quality standards so don't even start with me.

We got our food. My eggs Benedict (asparagus and swiss) was ok, just on par enough to eat as I was starving. The hash browns?  Cold. The fruit? Wait....is that plastic? Cause like, I'm pretty sure forks are supposed to go through kiwi. Oh wait the strawberries are real! Oh....they're brown. Gross.

So I made the classic mistake simply by going to a chain instead of a decent place, sure. But seriously, that was WAY below standard. Neither of us finished, and sorry snappy pants, no tip for you.

Should have just hit a Tim Hortons."}
{"text":"Good food with great presentation. Good service! Gluten free options available on menu."}
{"text":"Ate here once and it was just ok. Although they did have a good selection to choose from I prefer Eggsmart's. Also the service here was mediocre. The waiter did check on us occasionally but when we actually needed him he was no where to be found. 

One important thing to me is when I go out for breakfast I like to have a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice and at Cora's it tastes like its from the carton. That's a little disappointing."}
{"text":"Had the Breakfast poutine was absolutely delicious only disappointment was I couldn't finish it all (very filling). Wait staff was very pleasant and attentive, will definitely come back next time i'm in Pickering."}
{"text":"some great things here but mostly it just skates by. the fruit is extremely fresh, comes in big portions, and comes with every dish so that's really cool. the waffles, although nothing to write home about, taste delicious with custard - we don't do that in the states but dammit we should.

what isn't cool are the small portions of non-fruit food, such as the crepes. for 10-12 dollars i expect a slightly larger portion of food and less fruit. service was friendly and food was served quite quickly so don't be scared if there's a long line."}
{"text":"Have been to this location a few times for early breakfast. Food has been consistent and quick to arrive. Staff are pleasant but minimal staff on hand earlier in day so expect that you may need to flag them down for coffee refills."}
{"text":"I recently won a free brunch @ Coras ... was very excited to finally try it out with my 3yr old son as it looked like a healthy place for brunch.
I was impressed with the fact that they cut up the grapes in the kids breakfast...good thought so the kids don't choke, very important.
However....I was not impressed with the pulled pork sandwich I ordered...worst pulled pork i've ever had. The Mocha coffee was small and tasted like there was NO chocolate involved at all... Also, the carrot and celery sticks came to us already stuck into a dish of thousand island dressing....what if you don't like that kind of dressing???
All in all, I am glad I wasn't paying for that visit and I won't be returning."}
{"text":"This Cora's location does not live up the standards set by its  sister restaurants in the rest of the city. Here, the portions were smaller, the eggs were served cold, and the fruit was not fresh.  I'd rather trek to the suburbs to eat at a Cora's, where quantity and quality are taken more seriously."}
{"text":"I get to eat more fruit in one meal that I would in a week so I guess it's good for me!
They slice the apples in a genius way!

I love eating here, but I always feel bad when it comes time to pay, fresh fruit comes at a price."}
{"text":"Great food, staff and environment. Had breakfast 3 times here during my week in Toronto. Plan accordingly this place can get extremely busy."}
{"text":"The service is great at this location.  Everyone that works here is welcoming and friendly.
Even though the food is not bad, the price that you are paying for the food is too much for the quality that it is; I have spent up to $35 for breakfast on myself which included an omlette with potatoes, a side order of fruit, a smoothie, and a coffee.  

Hot House Cafe offers a breakfast buffet on Sundays for $19 and the food is better quality; plus, there are alot of options.

It is a good place to go as a last resort."}
{"text":"I had the chance to visit Cora's a couple of times and the food was average but they made up for it with a nice portion of fruits. But the service level has debased since the last time I visited!

I took my parents there to celebrate an early Father's Day brunch but was greeted by a rude and petty server. We went at around 11am on a weekday so the place wasn't busy but somehow it took them 10 minutes to get us seated. Having been to Cora's before, I know it takes a while for the food to come out so we asked our server for some water while we waited. 

But the server  ignored our request for water so my dad asked him for it again, and he curtly said \"COMPLAINING ABOUT IT WON'T MAKE IT COME FASTER\" And after another 10 mins, he came by and basically threw our water on our table and left. 

The bene-dictine I ordered was terrible, the eggs weren't poached properly and the potatoes were burnt. The whole plate looked messy! Unbelievable!  I will never go back to this location again!"}
{"text":"Some of my friends were raving about this place so I decided to visit.
I do find the average items on the menu are a little heavy for my palate and breakfast budget. However, purely by accident (the waiter brought the wrong dish and was very apologetic and would have changed it but it looked so good I insisted on keeping it) I discovered a Breakfast special (at less than $10.00) which was a full Candian style breakfast plate (Two eggs, sausage, ham, bacon, hashbrowns,pancake, fruit and toast). I certainly was not rushed, and I too appreciated the free Toronto Star."}
{"text":"Our breakfast was reasonable, but the restaurant was decorated like a nursery school.  I am surprised they didn't bring my coffee in a sippy cup.  Not going back to this place."}
{"text":"Had this place recommended by staff at the lame Fran's on Shuter (!), and finally tried it with the younglings.  Cappucino was a real cappucino, not a Starbucks latte-with-foam, the freshly-squeezed grapefruit juice was fantastic, and the food is fresh and delicious (omgfruit).  The kids loved it too.  Will definitely be in the brunch rotation from now on!"}
{"text":"I met some friends here that were visiting from Ottawa. We went with our baby in the stroller and they sat us at the very back due to the stroller.

Our baby was sleeping in the stroller and they asked us 5-6 times to move the stroller. Our stroller was between our table and the empty table next to us. The entire back section was empty but yet they still had a problem with a stroller being in the empty back of the restaurant.
Each time, I responded asking where they would like me to seat my baby that cannot sit up?

Eventually we had to move our stroller against the wall at the back and I had to hold my baby while eating. 

I ordered the Eggs Benedict and there were shells in it. I don't think it's acceptable for eggshells to be in a dish, especially from a breakfast restaurant where you think they should know how to crack an egg. 

I'm very forgiving, but my experience was so poor. 

Would not return or recommend."}
{"text":"I have had ONE out of three breakfasts here that was good.

You'd think a breakfast restaurant could do poached eggs!  No.  Second time, too hard; third time, runny and full of vinegar.  Coffee, tasteless.  Potatoes not crisp.

Not a very big crowd at breakfast time last week, either.  Wonder why."}
{"text":"I've not been disappointed here yet, depending on when you go you might have to wait, actually I've never not had to wait to go in, usually it can take about 20mins to get a seat.

I like pretty much everything that is considered vegetarian on the menu, they have very limited options for vegans. Vegans would be limited to fruit and toast, this is more of a egg eaters heaven than anything else.

I go here often because my mother in law likes the place, so I will go again."}
{"text":"Delicious food,  Los of healthy options.  A bit pricey compared to a Greasy Spoon.  But it's worth it."}
{"text":"Great presentation, ambiance and the food is fine.  But the price is what disappoints.  $30+ for a breakfast for two, and that's the minimum.  Perhaps its better to visit Cora's for brunch."}
{"text":"This was my first time to coras and it was slightly underwhelming. First we got totally lost trying to even find the restaurant. It's hidden in the back of a smart center with a billion stores I had to turn around about 3 times. We were seated quickly, our waitress was quick and efficient but not memorable, simply a vessel for transporting food. I ordered the Cora special, the bacon wAs the kind you put in the microwave at home, the pancake was a weird spongy material, however the eggs were good and the home fries so-so. The rye bread was a nice marbled rye but they buttered the inside and stuck them together which made me think there was no butter on it, then when I went to pick it up I got butter all over my hand. Not fun. Overall the bill wasn't bad 13 bucks for a fair amount of sub par food. I probably wouldnt come back unless other breakfast joints are closed."}
{"text":"It's a nice place where people can get together and the food is good.
I like that there are lots of fruits in every portion and dish so that when you order something not too healthy lol 
The service is very attentive. Recommended."}
{"text":"I hope this doesn't come off as a negative review.  I'm only writing this so people unfamiliar with the \"Cora\" brand know what they're getting into. 
Let's start off by throwing words like 'quirky', 'charming', and 'unique' right out the window.  Cora's is a passable, large Canadian chain restaurant.  As a reference for U.S. customers, this place is like Denny's but with a more limited menu and lower quality food.

I ordered a plate of pancakes, eggs, and fruit.  The fruit was fine, as were the eggs.  I took one bite of the pancakes (as I listened to the radio loudly pumping out the Top 40 station) and realized I was at the wrong restaurant: they were just warmed over disks of wet flour.  The coffee is not great, it's (akin to) Farmer's Brothers or worse.
This place, like most large chains, favors quantity of food over quality.

Pros:  the service was fast and friendly, the toast was warm and buttery, the place seemed clean."}
{"text":"Can't really say much about the food, because we walked out after sitting here for 10 minutes without even being acknowledged on a not very busy morning."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times, but my latest experience was the worse service.  I was there for brunch with a friend.  My friend ordered a dish that was eggs, bacon, toast, and pancakes.  When it arrived, he had to ask for syrup for the pancakes.  No big deal.  Syrup arrived, wait staff left quickly.  Then noticed that butter was missing.  Flag down another server for butter.  Later in the meal notice, no jams or peanut butter for the toast.

Since Cora's is a very busy brunch place that the staff lack attention to detail and basically just rushing to get things done instead of making sure customers have a good service experience.

Presentation of food is great, but again then kitchen staff was just pushing orders through instead of ensuring good quality.  Eggs over-easy was basically a quick fry egg where parts of the egg whites were not cooked."}
{"text":"For a restaurant in downtown Toronto, I think that Cora's could greatly benefit from a renovation. Maybe even from a new space altogether-- for instance, one with windows would be nice. This felt like a cafeteria for guests at the nearby hotels.

That said, the service was fast and friendly. For those of you who are worried about the line-ups, we were there at 2pm on a Saturday, and the restaurant was only about a third full."}
{"text":"This is a solid place to visit for breakfast or brunch. It was within walking distance of our hotel and had a line around the corner so we decided to visit. The inside looks massive in comparison to the outside. Also, the menu is extensive loaded with all the breakfast favorites.

I love that they have fresh juice and smoothies. The only drawback was the service. I couldn't tell if they were short staffed or just swamped, because as I mentioned the line was out the door. The. Entire. Time. During our visit, servers were traveling from the kitchen to their tables in warp speed. Thankfully, we had no agenda other than throughly enjoying our brunch. 

The food was delicious, portions large, and prices wonderful!"}
{"text":"They took forever to serve and by the time I got breakfast served, it was about 45 mins. All of this when the place was barely half filled with people. I am extremely disappointed by the service. Can't blame them when there are only 2 waiting tables. The food was good, and that left me leaving 2 stars for this place."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Cora's. In fact, my boyfriend and I would choose a weekend brunch at Cora's over lunch or dinner in a heart beat. This isn't the location we go to, but I've been to this one a couple times.

Every time, there's something that grinds my gears (And I've learned to become a chill diner after working as a server and bartender for years). The last time I went there, it was at 11:30 a.m. on a weekday. It was not busy - we were one of the few tables occupied - and yet our server took forever to come around for EVERYTHING. We wanted to look at the lunch menu, but had to wait 20 minutes for him to come around to even ask for one. And, honestly, if you're working a weekday lunch, you should be handing out both menus automatically without a second thought. Also, my empty water glass went unnoticed and it took about 10 minutes to get the condiments we required. Truthfully, my ketchup request wasn't a huge deal, but my friend should have gotten her salad dressing shortly after, if not before, her meal hit the table. We had to wait another 15 minutes for our empty plates to be cleared, and to get bills. Annoying, to say the least.

The time before that, my meal came out wrong. Again, I understand that things happen, but this was during a time that wasn't that busy, either. It was on a late weekend morning, after the expected rush. I ordered the Sunshine Panini (my usual) with bacon instead of ham. Yet it came with ham. And the server was confused when I said I ordered it with bacon. Ok, we all get orders wrong, but HELLO, where were you when I said, \"but could I get that with bacon please?\" The best part was, AFTER I asked for it to be made with bacon, I asked for a side of potatoes that I did get on time. If you're not going to remember the entire order, write it down. Nobody puts the pen and paper method to shame. I'd rather watch you take note if necessary than have to wait for the main item on my plate to be remade.

As I mentioned at the beginning, I love Cora's and frequent it often. But this is one location that I hate going to. The only reason I went back the second time was because my friend lived in walking distance, so it was most convenient for her. But since she just moved to Edmonton, I'll never be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Large, well-staffed, friendly service, and great food. Sunday at 10am was pretty busy but there's lots of tables and room for everyone. The lineup at the door rarely got too long. I ordered Theo's Skillet, which is fried vegetables with an egg, served with toast and a fruit cup. That was $11.65. Add a coffee and HST and the price is almost $16. But where could I find a nicer breakfast?"}
{"text":"This was our first time at this Coras. I was pleasantly surprised at how spacious it was inside.

It took a bit of time for us to be acknowledged in the queue by anyone - it's always nice when someone at least nods to let you know they know you're there - it wasn't particularly busy so not an onerous task.

We ordered quickly as we are familiar with the menu. Eggs Benedict and 2 jo constructions, Food was good, cutlery clean. Had to ask for top ups of the coffee and for water.

We were having an enjoyable time chatting and eating, but after a while we felt more than slightly hassled by the waitress to finish up as she started making more visits to our booth, which spoiled the experience. It was a Wednesday and not busy so we were definitely not holding up customers in line.

Would go again if we are in the area. I posted a review of the Queensway Coras - this one showed up the difference in quality. Would like to see more understanding waitress."}
{"text":"Came in here once for breakfast.

Food & Presentation: The menu was organized in a thoughtful way. I got the Eggs and ham Ben et Dictine, just to note, I haven't had eggs benedict before. The yolk was nice and gooey on the inside. It came with a variety of fruits (apple, kiwi, banana, orange, a strawberry etc), more than what I am used to, all arranged in a neat creative way. I thought I'd like the Hollandaise sauce but I did not enjoy it as much. Overall, the food would really fill you up here.

Atmosphere & Service: The decor is nice, family, and kid friendly. Seats are comfy. The staff are very kind and quick. You can also see the kitchen. I was here at around 10am on a Thursday, and soon after the place was piling up with breakfast eaters.

Pricing: The serving size was large, good amount, however I've had breakfast at other places and this place is a bit above what I'd expect to pay."}
{"text":"Fantastic lunch spot for folks along the subway line. Easy to get to, quiet during the week days so that you can easily have a meeting if necessary, priced well within the $10 meal range and always so good for you. Cora's for lunch! Fantastic."}
{"text":"I usually like Cora's, I have it often in Toronto. It's a bit pricier than other places for brunch food but it's still good when it comes to the food and service. However at this location, it is so busy that it takes a while to get a table and service is quite slow. You probably won't even be able to get your waiter's attention. The food also takes quite some time. I was expecting the normal delicious Cora's food that I have at other locations but honestly it was nowhere close which was really surprising. Even though the service was slow and inattentive, it was decent when our waiter did serve us. I don't think I will ever be coming back to this location and I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"The worst, I mean THE WORST service I have ever had in my life. My friends and I got seated at a table and we asked for a booth, but they couldn't move us to one, okay fine. It took about 15 minutes for a waiter to even talk to us. By the time someone came, it was the most rude and impatient person ever. He greated us by saying \"Hi ladies, what do you want to order?\" (Mind you he said this in a rude, rushing, and impatient way as if we were a burden to him when we had not even done anything to give him a hard time). Not- Hi welcome to Coras, can I get you something to drink? Do you want a minute to look over the menu? When we said we said we didn't know what we wanted he rolled his eyes and walked away. We asked him numerous times to bring us extra things like napkins, silverware, and butter before he actually brought it. Many times when trying to communicate we would call him over and as we were in the middle of speaking to him he would walk away so we never knew if he heard what was said. When he came back to take our order he was acting the same way and we were very irritated with his frantic attitude. Once the food finally came, the order was wrong and we told the waitress who brought it to our table. He came back with a big attitude, asking us what was wrong about the order as if it was our fault? The manager even noticed how upset we were and made the waiter come ask us how our food was because he never asked himself. It was my friends birthday and he ruined her morning by being so rude and impolite for no reason.  Not to mention we hated the way he snatched the menus from our hands and threw our bill on the table. I was so bitter that I had to pay for food and service like this. After an unpleasant visit, we called the manager over and explained how the waiter was treating us. All he said was \"Okay I'm sorry\" not- Ill talk to him, is there something I can do? Ill take this item off your bill, nothing. We were so unsatisfied with the service and taken back by how rude he was for no reason that we just wanted to get out of there. At that point we didn't even care that the food was gross we just wanted to leave. You cannot treat paying customers that way, I don't care how bad his day was. Wish I never went to this place, it was only convenient because it was across the street from our hotel. NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"Quirky breakfast place - colours all around. Looks like a huge kids nursery with yummy foods. I think it's aimed at kids, but big kids can enjoy too  
I ordered the April 89 crepe and when the waitress brought it over I knew I would never finish it within a reasonable time. Lots of fresh fruits, custard and cream on the biggest crepe I've seen. I got about 3/4  before I gave up. Also the fresh juices are lovely. 
It gets really busy and sometimes you have to wait in the line to be seated although there are tables available - perhaps more staff for busier times would be appropriate - especially it's breakfast and everyone is really hungry! 
Menu is very healthy and I can't recall seeing anything greasy available - so perfect for kids breakfast or the health conscious. 
Service is friendly and attentive when they can be. Nice breakfast place but at $15+ for a crepe and juice it's a little steep."}
{"text":"Just fantastic, crêpe, waffle, pancakes, eggs and fresh fruit too.

After trying so many places, I've finally found great breakfast in Toronto."}
{"text":"I was craving breakfast and was finished my work on campus nearby so I thought I would try Cora's for takeout.
 
Ambience: As soon as I walked in there was no one at the front to greet me. It was just an empty restaurant front while everything else was happening towards the back of the place. I had to walk in and look for a server to help me.

Food: I was ordering breakfast for my sister and myself. I ordered the Mountain of Strawberries Waffles for myself and the Delicious Cherries pancakes, sausage and a side of syrup for my sister. We both enjoyed our breakfast!

Service: The server who was helping me gave me the menu and pointed out exactly what I wanted. I asked for my receipt and noticed that she charged me for something I didn't order.. Instead of putting in an order for the Cherry pancakes, she charged me for the Blueberry Fields. I let her know, she apologized and she went to go change the order with the kitchen. My food arrived and as she handed me the bags, she mentioned how the Cherry pancakes cost $1.75 more but how she waived it because it was her mistake with the mix-up.. (Okay.. you screwed up, why are you letting me know that it was more expensive, even though it was your mistake?)

Price: I paid almost $30 for both meals.. which is not very student friendly in terms of prices. 

I'd probably come back to dine in, eat for 1, and probably bring a friend. I would probably also try their smaller servings for an inexpensive meal."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant experience ... arrived with my baby who was sleeping in her stroller the first greeting was that i need to place her in a high chair depsite the fact that she can not sit up yet in a high chair and was freaking sleeping... when i said she can not sit up in a high chair the waitress was like , what about place her in a car seat !! i didnt have my car seat as i came to the restaurant walking with a baby and a stroller how hard to understand is that?! 
my husband got upset and left the restaurant , i asked to speak to a manager which didn't show any signs of interest that i was extremely upset and frustrated as i was not welcomed in just because i had my 5 month old baby sleeping in her stroller.
rude management and customer service
next time they need to put up a sign that babies with strollers are not welcomed.
never going back!"}
{"text":"They know us by name and treat us so well. The food is always great and fresh. The owner is so nice and comes to say hi to my son every time we come. this is our favorite family breakfast place to go every weekend. It's a bit more expensive than your typical breakfast place, but totally worth it. Much healthier food and the service is top notch!"}
{"text":"If my husband wakes up early enough on a weekend (lol) this is our breakfast place.

I don't mind greasy spoon breakfast diners, but my husband is more picky than I am.

This is the ideal place for someone who has a sweet tooth yet doesn't want to feel too guilty eating something sweet for breakfast.

Most of the options are crepes.  I've had crepes in Montreal a few times, and I believe it's authentic. 

From there, you can decide how sinful you want to be (i.e. chocolate sauce versus no chocolate sauce, whipped cream versus no whipped cream).

Over 90% of the dishes come with a pile of fresh fruit, and I'm talking FRESH even in the dead of winter....

I don't have a sweet tooth, but this place has plenty of egg options for me.

I usually have one of their omelettes, wrapped in a crepe, and have been very content."}
{"text":"This isn't a good sign.  I had breakfast here with 5 friends 1 week ago, and I pretty much forget the whole experience.  Random memories;

This place was BIG!
Service was decent.
Food was mediocre.
Fruit looked good, but was disappointing.
A friend had the \"Raspberry 4 Lucie\", which looks a lot better on the menu.  His looked like an item from Pillsbury. (See my photo)

We included this place on our list of \"places to try\" out of a feeling of responsibility, but we definitely don't feel the need to go back."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast!!! Everything I've ever ordered off the menu has been superior! The coffee is also equally delicious and the staff make sure you never run out. The staff are always friendly, helpful and extremely pleasant. The prices are very reasonable for the amount and quality of food you get. By far my favorite breakfast place in Toronto!"}
{"text":"My friends and I visited this Cora's location a few weeks back for brunch. I love finding spots for brunch and have been here a few times. This location however was VERY busy and loud.

The menu offers lots of options (even for vegetarians) and always is a crowd pleaser. I usually get the ham and swiss panini crepe with the fruit (I find that the potatoes are not usually crispy or fully cooked). I have also tried the banana and nutella crepe which is delicious but massive! So if you have plans on trying it make sure to share it with a friend :)

Also small side note, even though the coffee is a little overpriced it is awesome and not to mention bottomless. The only problem with this is that I always drink 2-3 cups and then get the caffeine jitters after lol

Overall, I do like Cora's and will be back again and again. It is a little on the pricy side but sometimes I just can not get over my craving of the panini crepe!

Next time however, I will be visiting a different location as this one truly is ALWAYS busy."}
{"text":"They have a great range of food on their menu. They will customize your food based on your dietary needs"}
{"text":"Why would anyone want to eat at this ridiculous place? The prices are sky high - $8 for two eggs!!, and it took them 15 minutes to make, or longer, I am not sure because I walked out, having worn out all the patience in the world for two eggs sunny side up. And if you don't like cheese... Good luck, every stupid item on the menu has either Swiss or cheddar stuffed in it somewhere.

Really, your precious time and hard earned money deserve better than to be spent here."}
{"text":"The food is fairly mediocre as is the service. 
I ordered a spinach and cheese crepe and it would have been great if not bone dry. Had to smother it in maple syrup to eat it. It was not bad enough to send back, but if I was not that hungry to begin with I probably would have. The presentation was nice, for what that's worth. The price is on the high end but it was not outrageous. 

The service was a bit on the slow side but I did come at the tail end of the lunch rush so I am willing to overlook that. However, the table was not sufficiently turned over and quite sticky from the previous customer.

Overall, it is a viable option if you are in the area and just looking for okay food, but not worth going out of your way for."}
{"text":"Meh this isn't the best Coras location I've been to. After I ate I instantly felt sick my stomach was aching all the way home. The fruits were not fresh at all they looked so dry as if they were cut 2 days ago. The price is really expensive for breakfast food. Probably won't go back to Coras after this experience"}
{"text":"The food was alright. I never really go out to specialty breakfast/ lunch places and was surprised to find that you can't even order simple bacon and eggs for a reasonable price. I ended up going with a breakfast poutine for about $11 and ended up with a bill for $20 for a single person when I found out that the single glass of orange juice I ordered cost me an additional $3. All of the menu items seem a bit pointlessly over the top and  I would've rather had a simple breakfast for a much more reasonable price. I probably won't be eating there again unless I want to do some serious damage to my wallet."}
{"text":"Just this wonderful place to have brunch every day, great food, nice coffee, really healthy."}
{"text":"Cora's is so good and at that fact its so good that theres line ups that go out the store , i went one time and decided not to go cause it was taking to long but good food for a great price."}
{"text":"yes and no experience

nice atmosphere, very popular, food looked great ,and came in a nice big portion butttttttttt...

When I got in my car and started to drive away I felt this rumble in my stomach ohh that dosnt feel good at all, oh man I need a washroom FAST. If your ever all bunged up this is the place to go!

Oh and there is a poster below me that says this place is too hard to find, I dont know how much bigger they can make the sign you can see it loud and clear from the hwy. The strip mall is right beside a walmart not that hard to find at all."}
{"text":"Really great place!  My boyfriend and I stopped in for breakfast.  We don't go out to eat much and usually go to vegan places but couldn't find any open early so we went here.  We were pleasantly surprised!  Lots of options and the waiter helped me make sure I didn't have anything with dairy.  Many options with fruit.  I had a crepe with fruit and my boyfriend had a crepe and french toast with some fruit too.  I also had a fruit cocktail to drink.  All of it was delicious.  I couldn't even finish my breakfast, it was a very large serving.
The waiter was kind and not overly friendly (which I like, I hate it when they are super friendly).  The service was fast.  The prices seemed a bit higher than I would expect but not crazy expensive.  It's decent for \"once in a while\".  I liked the decor, it was very cheery.
I would definitely recommend if you're looking for a place with delicious breakfast options!"}
{"text":"I was here for breakfast on April 6, and was satisfied. I left my hotel walking around looking for breakfast, and this is the only place I could find! The line was out the door so i thought it was going to be amazing, however I found it to be very average and a little overpriced. The service is good, and the portions are average. If I had a choice, not sure if I would return."}
{"text":"Cora doesn't make the best breakfast, but they are pretty creative while they're at it. The selection of fruit breakfast platters trumps other all-day breakfast places, and the colourful decors and timely service makes for a great experience."}
{"text":"Tried twice. 

The part I like is that most of the options, the food goes with lots of fruits, kinda healthy (which is also the reason why i choose to come). However, it is also because of the fruits that I don't like there. Fruits in general are too raw, every fruits taste so sour that i can barely finish.

Restaurant was packed, and waiters were a bit slow. I ordered bottomless coffee and most of time i need to call them twice to fill up my cup."}
{"text":"BEST BREAKFAST/BRUNCH PLACE EVER!! 

We went last year passing through town and boy was it yummy!!  

Eye watering menu pics and food going by on trays looks like artwork.  We got our food and it was even better than it looked and it looked amazing!   Love LOVE love this place!!!  I would get it 500 stars if I could!!"}
{"text":"Cora's is a classic brunch spot, and definitely one of the best food chains for sure. Their brunch options like omelettes and crepe are deliciously made and are All very good quality. Prices are very fair for the size of the meals. This location is a good size and vey conveniently located and easy to get to by ttc 504 college streetcar or walking from college subway. Definitely a great spot to go if you have a good appetite! Definitely try their variety of smoothies they're all quite good!"}
{"text":"This franchise used to have a homier feel to them, now that they have hit the big cities, they have become more like cafeteria's with table service. big boring faceless places, overworked and stressed wait staff due to the volume. And the food was just average at best. 

I've been here twice and probably will likely never return if i can avoid it. Not that i had an horrible experience here, or that the food was terrible, i just found the whole experience very rushed, and again very cafeteria like, and for the price, i just don't think it's worth it. I'd rather go elsewhere with better atmosphere and food.

This franchise has really lost it focus."}
{"text":"Loooove all the toast and fruit, its awesome for breakfast or brunch. cora has a bright clean atmosphere that is perfect in the morning. the only down falls are the astronomical proces, wait time, and limited operating hours, im the type of person that adores breakfast food any time of the day and this restaurant just doesnt offer that. the breakfast foods are delicious, the lumch menu is meh. Overall i enjoyed it very much\1"}
{"text":"I was shocked to come here at 10 AM on a Saturday to get seated immediately. At any uptown location, by 10 AM I would have had to wait at least a half hour due to the crowds that would have formed by then. Goes to show you the difference in weekend waking hours south of Bloor. I had the eggs benny with brie which was decent, except that the brie felt a bit dry and old in a not-so-good way. The explosion of delicious fruit really helped to cut the grease and calorie dense yolk."}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Toronto, I went to Cora's as it was recommended from my hotel. The breakfasts are delicious, plentiful and freshly prepared. The staff is INSANELY nice and attentive to their customers. And the restaurant is clean, bright and inviting.

The few knocks I have on this place are
- its a bit pricey 
- the menu can be too eccelectic. There are a lot of interesting combinations and that's great if you want to try something new. But sometimes you want something \"regular\" (i.e. eggs and bacon) and its hard to find on the menu."}
{"text":"I love this place.  You can get 2 eggs with a mountain of fresh fruit.  They have crepes, waffles, omelettes and more.   Everything is loaded with healthy goodness and tastes delicious.  The service is excellent and we'll be back before we leave this freezing city!  They even hand out fudge as a treat when you leave.. . a diabetic's dream.

Oh, the coffee is great too. . .
Check out the photos for more delicious options."}
{"text":"Going to Cora's feels like an outing for me. 
Partly because I have to go out of the way but also because of how enormous this place is. 
Unlike many other brunch places, Cora's gives you a full plate with fruit, usually in some beautiful arrangement. 
The food is quite good. I love getting the moccha but it's small. 

However: 
It is expensive. 
Always packed, and you have to wait to be seated, often quite a while
They shuffle you in and out, due to how crowded it is

All in all, going to Cora's is a good experience, but definitely not a weekly place for the avid bruncher (unless you are loaded)."}
{"text":"wow I wonder how I never knew of this place before?...
and that's considering that my friends love to do sunday brunches and this place is all about yummylicious brunch food.

came here with few friends completely hungovered and we thought we'd have to spend hours in the lineup that looked looooong... but somehow we waited for less than 10min before we were finally seated. 

the menus are great - all with pictures so you actually see what you order (love it!) and the variety of food is huge even for vegetarians. not so sure about vegan menu. 

always go for the fruit cocktail of the day as it looks and tastes yummy!

and oh the florentines here are aaaaaaaaaaamazing! esp the one with mushrooms and brie cheese=) and apparently the one with salmon that my friends had was amazing too.
it ends up being a bit costly but for the amount of food you get and the quality and friendly service - it's totally worth it!"}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast with a few of my girlfriends. This location is much more opened, and bigger than the location near the waterfront. Tons of seating space for groups and families. 
The staff are welcoming and friendly and attentive.
I love how there are so many options on the menu! Whether you're looking for a hearty breakfast of eggs, bacon, sausage and home fries or stacks of pancakes or something healthier such as a massive fruit platter, or parfaits. Price ranges also range differently, some start as low as $8.00. 
I ordered the giant fruit platter, my friends ordered a stack of pancakes with cherries, another friend ordered an omelette wrap with hollandaise sauce, and another friend ordered a breakfast poutine. Everyone enjoyed their meals. 
Portions are big and beautifully presented!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times, and each and every time it's enjoyable! For a central downtown location in Toronto, this place offers great service and won't be rushing you out the door too quickly, either. Cora's is an old favorite of mine, and I am always happy to find one when I am travelling!"}
{"text":"Cora's used to be a staple on my list of places for breakfast. But unfortunately I feel like they need to revamp their menu to catch up the numerous breakfast joints that have opened up in the last little while who provide accommodations. 

I came to this location on a weekday morning (8:45am) with my work party to celebrate with a Holiday Breakfast. 

The server took a very long time to take our orders. 
The menu had little to no vegan options. There were 2 vegans on our table who were offered fruit as breakfast. 

I always order the Crepe Omelette (Spinach and Cheese). It comes with this delicious Hollandaise sauce. You honestly can't go wrong. But if I ever wish to order the Western Omelette and ask for the ham to be substituted for spinach it becomes an issue. Cora's please try to cater to the population that doesn't eat pork or meat - let alone bi-products of meat.

I feel this place is overrated. Pretty food as opposed to quality tasting food without a range of food options on the menu."}
{"text":"Pricey for a breakfast spot, but the veritable mountain of fresh fruit in fancy configurations on your plate is worth the price of admission, as is the sublime smoked salmon eggs benny.  Cora's hollandaise is perfectly emulsified, smooth and creamy with just the right amount of lemony zip to kick start your senses in the morning.  The slightly salty salmon compliments the richness of the hollandaise and the crunchy home fries are a nice additional side.

At Cora's the service is blindingly fast, yet you never feel as if you are being hustled through the door, despite a line up that has been known to snake out into the street.  Cora's does breakfast well, actually better than most, as they should, being a designated breakfast place and all."}
{"text":"I get the cinnamon French toast with a bunch of fruit on top! It's a tad pricey but it's nice every once in a while."}
{"text":"This rating is for this location only and based on what I ordered. 

I've been to many Cora's and althought Toronto ones are not as good as Montreal's, this one is the worst so far. 
The coffee was watery and tasteless. For 2.25 a cup would have expected more. 
Our server was okay, but I felt terrible for the people waiting in line for a table, with many tables available, and all servers running around aimlessly (or what seemed like it)
I ordered the April 89 - crepe with custard, fresh fruit and whipped cream. The Crepe was cold (expected I guess) and topped with Cool Whip, not fresh cream. 
The fruit inside wasn't fresh at all, the strawberries were sour and the cantelope and pineapple had hard chunks
My mom's french toast and eggs were okay, but the measely strips of bacon and scarce fruit were hardly something appetizing. 

Service was quick for the most part, but we got there earlier than the crowd. 

There were also a few flies on the wall, litterally, not good

Other alternatives could be eggspecations and frans at south of dundas and yonge. so much better"}
{"text":"Cora's is busy and lively place. I Cora's Breakfast for my fruit fix and it's rare to see so much variety on one plate. The price isn't much more than a standard 3 egg breaky at any other brunch place. Here you get a mountain of fruit, your cinna-bun fix and eggs! Sweet, savory and fresh never tasted so good.

I'm going back there this weekend. My review reminded me of how well they do breakfast. One more day... I will have you... soon."}
{"text":"I have the strawberry Avalanche - Strawberries on French toast.  A great addition to the menu.  The wife had eggs benny and loved the eggs cooked to order."}
{"text":"Oh no Cora's what happened. I used to love you so much.  I love breakfast and Cora's was one of the restaurants that always correlated with weekend family breakfast. 

However, I came here and the food was mediocre. I got Louis the undecided with a side order of hollandaise sauce and a coffee to drink. The potatoes was extra burnt while the eggs were rubbery. Our waitress forgot my hollandaise sauce and throughout the whole meal I tried to find a waitress to ask for it, but she was in the kitchen. Also,My coffee was never refilled.  

Perhaps will give it another chance for the sake of previous good memories.

{"text":"We stopped in here on a Sunday afternoon after watching my husband's marching band in the St. Patrick's Day parade. We were with my friend, a native of Toronto, and he recommended Cora as a good brunch place were I would have a lot of options (thinking of my food allergies and how egg allergies don't always work well st brunch places!). He did not steer us wrong, as usual! This was a fast, reasonably priced and tasty brunch option, and I would return in the future. 

We walked in to a busy dining room but were promptly seated and given time to browse the extensive menu. I was definitely impressed with the options, and decided to make a meal out of sides. I ordered the turkey bacon, ham, and potatoes, and the kind and attentive waitress offered me gluten-free toast as an option. They are very food allergy friendly here! My brother ordered the Western Skillet, and our friend the Eggs Benedict, his go-to meal here. 

Everything came out quickly and hot! The portions are large, and I ended up sharing most of my ham with my brother. I loved the potatoes- they were baked instead of fried, and had a crispy outer layer. The turkey bacon was interesting and resembled Canadian bacon more so than the standard thin turkey bacon we have in the States.

Our waitress stopped by frequently to check on us, and our water glasses were always full. Thanks for a great meal!"}
{"text":"We're visiting Canada for the first time, and our 6yo insisted that we eat here because it has her name.

So glad we did. A little pricey, but you get a ridiculous amount of food. The staff was wonderful, and even made a face out of the fruit at my daughter's request. Overall, it was a wonderful brunch before setting out for a frigid day at the zoo."}
{"text":"Even though I don't live in downtown Toronto, I'm always there - especially in the mornings. I've tried many breakfast places, but I still prefer Cora's the most in the Ryerson area! It's right by the MAC (Mattamy Athletic Centre) for those of you who know what I'm talking about, and makes for the perfect breakfast to have right before hitting the gym ;) there are many different Cora locations in the GTA as well, so I actually go quite often to various places.

Anywho, I've tried a lot of things on the menu and I've liked every item thus far. My favourite would have to be the salmon eggs benedict! Pretty big in size in comparison to other breakfast places, and there are many seasonal fruits and potatoes on the side for a full meal. Second fave would have to go to the tuna melt sandwich. You have an option of either fruits or potatoes on the side, but rest assured as you will get a huge portion worth the price you're paying! And I absolutely love the sandwich. It's simple but tastes delicious.

You can't go wrong with these dishes, or this restaurant for that matter if you're looking for a nice breakfast/brunch restaurant. The service here is always really great as well - I visit all the time and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Is good but busy. The food was good for prices. Little but of a line up and greeter was little grumpy. Clean big spacious and filled me up"}
{"text":"Found hair in my food at Cora's in Pickering this morning. They did not handle it appropriatly unfortunalty. I go to Cora's in Pickering fairly regularly with my daughter for breakfast always been a good experience. When I found the hair mixed in with my hollandaise sauce this morning I showed the waitress (who was very nice by the way) and she took it and had the kitchen redo my meal. By the time I got my meal my daughter had ready finished hers so I asked them to pack mine to go. Got the bill and no kind of discount as applied. I mentioned this to the waitress and her response was that they redid the meal for me. So I guess I was supposed to thank them for not making me eat food with hair in it? I said that a discount would be nice. She went to ask the manager who gave me a $5 discount. I feel under the circumstances, first finding hair in my food and then having to wait for it to be redone and therefore tainting my breakfast experience with my daughter a offering my meal for free this time might have been a nice gesture. It's s shame because I really like Cora's in Pickering my daughter and I really have a nice time when we go and then this happens. It's really a shame."}
{"text":"I got the rosemarys Sunday breakfast which came with blue berry pancakes (sub'd for chocolate chip), eggs, sausage, toast and fruits. I loved the pancakes but sad to say that was the only thing I really enjoyed. The potatoes were bland and I think they're overpriced overall."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast location in downtown Toronto.  Lots and lots of fruit!  The crepes are nice as well and the service is tops!  Kind of noisy with everyone trying to talk over themselves.  Expect a wait on the weekends."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants, but I make an exception for Cora's. Like most chains, the service at Cora's can be spotty but the food is pretty consistently good. The menu is varied enough so that there's something for everybody, whether their breakfast preference is savory or sweet. I also like the fact that they offer fresh fruit that includes stuff other than the usual sad slice of unripe honeydew that you find at most cheap n' cheerful breakfast joints. 

The only down point (and it's a minor one at that), is their bizarre menu layout. All the menu items are in this bizarre hand-drawn font that makes it difficult to find what you're looking for. But, really, that's not a huge deal. It's breakfast, it's good, it's Cora's"}
{"text":"This Cora's is really close to my place, so sometimes come here for a quick brunch with friends. Cora's in general is a much better option than many other chain brunch locations like Fran's or Denny's #sorrynotsorry. The menu options feel more wholesome (i.e. lots of fresh fruit, whole grain, yogurt options), the presentation of the food much prettier, and the portions slightly larger.  

However, the point of this review is to point out that this particular Cora's tends to give smaller portion sizes (I don't know why, but I've consistently noticed this) and while the venue is spacious, there are not a lot of windows so feels a bit stuffy.  

If you want to visit a Cora's, go to the one downtown at 277 Wellington St W. They have huge windows that open up completely during the summer (converts into a sidewalk patio) and noticeably larger portion sizes and fresher fruits (might be psychological)."}
{"text":"Love Love Coras this location is an exception. Expect long line ups and always a packed house. The line ups are long but it does move along fast. It is very rowdy place so expect loud people running around like the staff to get your food out. The portions are filling and the fruit is tasty. You can actually specify what fruit you want if you are the picky type. The smoothies are delicious i usually opt for the the coras special or the battered sausage rolls plate. Very delicious. I do plan to come back often just wish they open longer as its packed house at all hours of the time. The place is clean and tidy and sign up for their newsletter theres usually coupons you can use and they give you a free something on your birthdays week which is a treat!"}
{"text":"Always busy but worth the wait.  The line moves relatively quick anyways.  Once inside you have a variety to choose from.  The Gargantuan is the breakfast of choice.  Be hungry if you do order this.  Love the baked beans and of course the French Canadian Creton.  Really speedy service and very friendly.  This is a favourite place to eat breakfast."}
{"text":"Its a good place to grab breakfast or lunch. They have a good selection of foods, and its pretty tasty and filling. Be aware though, if you are a student they don't offer any discounts and some of the prices can be quite high, especially for desserts. For that reason, I would not suggest Cora's for dessert, only for breakfast, brunch, or lunch. If you are going for dessert your best bet is Pickle Barrel.

The service has been average, nothing special, I do like the speed of the service and accuracy- but they could put on a smile now and then. 

I took away two stars for two reasons: 1) they don't offer a student discount; 2) the price of the desert (strawberry waffle) was expensive for what it was. The strawberry waffle came with a waffle, smeared with custard and strawberries on top- nothing spectacular, rather average looking and tasting. At Pickle Barrel, for a few dollars more you get a better tasting and bigger waffle, more strawberries, ice cream, and real Canadian maple syrup."}
{"text":"Do not dine here if you are vegetarian or vegan or do not eat meat for religious purposes.

I specifically ordered a vegetarian dish only to find chopped up ham in my omelette. I had 3 bites before I had bit on a chunk of ham. This is very upsetting! 

After bringing it to my waitress attention, I had my dish removed from the bill and that was it. 

They do not realize the severity of what they have done. Toronto is a diverse city with many people with dietary restrictions and religious dietary restrictions, this is a very serious offence!"}
{"text":"Large, hearty, delicious breakfasts pile up on the extensive menu at Cora's. I was going to give this place 4 stars until I realized the food looks just as photogenic when it's served as it does in those idealic photos in the menu. How often does that happen?"}
{"text":"Friendly waiters. Great for the kids. If ur feeling it u can ask for a sheet and crayons. The food is a lot. They fill every empty spot with fruits. I'm a breakfast person, I can do breakfast 3 times a day. If ur like me, this place would be perfect for u too."}
{"text":"Decent breakfast, better staff. I get the 10 star - basically a Noah's ark (two of every animal) of meat in an omelette. 

Everyone is insanely nice here and they always make a point of making you feel welcome."}
{"text":"I was looking for a brunch place around the area and Cora was recommended. Food was ok. Would I go back? No. Would I recommend this place No.

However, on a better note my server was lovely but the food did not look authentic and it also looked nothing like the pictures in the menu."}
{"text":"To preface, I am a pescepollotarian, and so brunch places, while I do love, are sometimes complicated because I always need to substitute or order a vegetarian meal! So after a long time at looking at the menu, I decided to get a meal that had bacon and sausage in it. I asked the server if they did substitutions, and he asked me \"Meat for meat?!\", like what else would I be substituting? So I asked for the bacon to be turkey sausage and the server asked if the other sausage would be pork or turkey, like of course it wouldn't be pork, like why would somebody have ordered 3 turkey and 3 pork sausages!

Other than that specific instance, the server was pleasant, and the atmosphere was very casual and bright. I would definitely recommend this place for brunch."}
{"text":"As always, great breakfast in a family friendly restaurant with a strong sense of home! ( not surprising given the fact it is run by a family) No matter which branch of Cora you try, it feels like you are at home fed with a caring mom! ( at least it feels like this to me!) The menu reinforces this feeling as it is customized in a way to include each family members individually. The food itself gives a feeling of having home-made food which you may not get in many chained restaurants. The staff in this particular branch are very funny, communicative, and accommodating! I would highly recommend this place to ones who want to enjoy a meal with lots of family-related vibes around!"}
{"text":"I do enjoy the food but the service is not adequate. This morning there was a long line for a table yet there were lots of empty tables. When I asked the hostess at the front about this she told me we had to wait for a server to come seat us. We left instead."}
{"text":"Canadians love over-the-top 2000 calorie breakfasts.

Lumberjack breakfasts make a lot of sense if you are then going out into the snow until sunset to chop down gigantic trees.

If you are just going to sit in an office all day looking at your computer screen, lumberjack breakfasts may not be the best health idea.

That said, if you are going to eat 2000 calorie breakfasts in the morning , they may as well be good ones that you will enjoy.

Cora's mega-breakfast-spectaculars taste pretty damm fine.

I decided to go health conscious - so I got one of the more scaled down choices.

For a mere 1480 calories, I was able to get two footlong grilled hot dogs in a tortilla wrap with fried potatoes and a hollandaise dip sauce.

I did not eat all of my hollandaise so that probably saved 300 calories right there.

They were fine hot dogs, the grill job was excellent, and hollandaise turns anything into pure sensuality.

Ii was going to be good and noble and skip the potatoes, but then I tasted just one.

You know how the rest of the story played out.

Really really fine charred potatoes dipped in hollandaise?

Really really fine charred potatoes dipped in hollandaise?

Forgive me, gastroenterologist, because I have sinned.

Well, let's just chalk it up as an experience of personal growth."}
{"text":"Visited this enormously sized brunch house on visit to Toronto.  Breakfast was very good w/very large portions.  The sausages seemed a bit rare and undercooked.  But otherwise the bacon, eggs, and fresh fruit were very good.  We had an issue waiting for our check while their computer system was re-booting, but our server, Alyssa, generously comped us a large glass of orange juice while we waited.  We ended up having breakfast 4 out of the 5 days we were in Toronto, and the aforementioned Alyssa was terrific and a sweetheart. She remembered that we not only both had coffee upfront, but also what we had ordered the previous morning.  May seem like a small detail, but shows she was on the ball."}
{"text":"Fantastic menu with creative food options and tons of fresh fruit variety.  Makes for a nutritious delicious satisfying breakfast and lunch.  The staff is beyond good, they are GREAT.  Especially P Stephen, and a woman who's name I didn't get when I had breakfast there this past Friday morning.  Great food, great staff, upbeat positive energy.  A standout!"}
{"text":"The absolute best breakfast restaurant I've ever been to in Canada. The inside is bright, exuberant, open and colorful. It'll surely make you want to wake up in the morning. Service does lack at 7:30am, so be prepared to spend a little time waiting around or just know what you want as you're being seated and have your bill brought to you when your food comes. Anyway, the good... EVERYTHING ELSE! The incredible food presentations, fresh food, flavors and just EVERYTHING! I've never wanted to eat fruit so badly until I saw the menu presentations. A \"bit\" pricy, but worth it. I ate here 3 times in 4 days."}
{"text":"Although I've lived in this area for 21 years, this was my first visit to this location of Cora's. I had the Beef-Beef Skillet which includes beef strips, beef patty, potatoes, hollandaise sauce, toast, and an egg. It was tasty and very filling but $40 for breakfast for two people is a bit steep.

The service was good and the restaurant was clean, spacious, and bright. Not sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"3 stars because the restaurant is a very casual breakfast restaurant. The menu is overwhelming with all the choices it has. The food was good though, I order the crepe breakfast wrap. It had eggs, ham and cheese( you can get bacon instead of ham). It came with a side of fruit salad (watermelon, kiwi, strawberries, cantaloupe, bananas, grapes and pineapple). My dad ordered the spinach egg white omelette and he said it was bland. The side of potatoes was really good though!"}
{"text":"Amazing amazing! love the food, excellent service. and a great selection of breakfast classics next to some fresh alternatives:) would def recommend"}
{"text":"Cora's is your standard breakfast chain, convenient to our hotel but nothing to write home about.  We ordered the eggs benedict and crepes.  It was just okay- the crepe was gummy and the filling was piled in the center so I had to open it and spread things around.  The eggs benedict were overdone but not terribly overdone.

If you are in a hurry or just want to get the job done with food, this is a decent choice.  However, there are so many wonderful places within walking distance I would be hard pressed to choose Cora's again."}
{"text":"Went to Cora's for breakfast after bragging to my sister how awesome Cora's was. Big mistake! Food was tasteless, warm at best and I didn't know eggs could be that small. We had bacon, pork, eggs, beans and three large slices of tomato. Why so much tomato is beyond me. The home fries were under cooked and some were nearly burnt. One of the worse breakfast I've ever had. Been there few times before but had signature dishes. Guess that was the mistake. Should have not order bacon and eggs."}
{"text":"Meh...way overpriced. I've tried this place twice and both times were a fail. It makes Denny's look good. Will not be giving it a third try. Only good part is it is family friendly and the staff was nice. Had a complaint and they took it off our bill. But I can make a much better breakfast at home for a lot cheaper."}
{"text":"This breakfast spot has got to be the best place to have a morning cup of joe and the whole breakfast nine yards.  Servings are huge and if you need your fruit fix this is the where it's at.  Beautifully plated and presented.  Ate there 4 mornings and had a different and delicious 2 eggs bene each time.  Service was attentive and quick.  I am looking forward to my next visit to Toronto just to have breakfast here.  Yep its that good."}
{"text":"Go for the Sunrise Ham and egg crepe panini sandwich. That may not be its exact name but really, it says it all. It's a very good choice AND it comes with fresh fruit salad. 
That said, had the Strawberry and Whipped Cream topped waffle today. Jerry Seinfeld was talking about waffles on a talk show the other day so they were on my brain. Added table syrup and washed it down with a hot chocolate. Hmmm....that could be why it's 330am and I'm still buzzing energy, writing reviews on yelp.
Being originally from Montreal, I've been a fan of \"Chez Cora's\" for awhile now. It's comfort food for me."}
{"text":"Really excellent service. Came in to a full restaurant on a busy Sunday at lunchtime and was very impressed. We were seated quickly, and our server Michael was friendly, funny, and attentive. Was amazed by how quickly our food came out considering how busy it was. Coffee cups never went empty and he made sure we had everything we needed. Definitely a new favourite."}
{"text":"Cora's does the most important meal of the day right! I have tried many dishes here and only one has been sub par. My favourite is the Cora special because its comes with bacon, sausage, ham, two eggs, home fries, toast and a little delightful crepe that I save for the end as a dessert! The portion is sufficient for my big appetite! 

My other favourite is the french toast brioche, absolutely heavenly! I would order it more often if it had more meat sides and home fries. Their lunch skillets are very tasty as well! I have had the chicken skillet which comes with soup or a juice. The only thing I wasn't a  fan of was the blueberry pancakes. I prefer crepes so the pancakes were too doughy for my liking. 

The dishes range from $9 and more, with two people going our bill is always over $30.  Cora's is something I like to splurge on once a while and so far my favourite breakfast place."}
{"text":"This place sells its self as a breakfast and lunch place but forget the lunch, this place is all about breakfast. This decor is very surreal. There is color all over the place, on the walls, on the menu and of course on the plate. Fruit is this Cora's specialty, and almost every meal comes with a healthy dose of fresh kiwis, watermelon, oranges and cantaloupe. The menu is not as comprehensive as Eggspectation but they have mastered the items that they do serve. The service was ok. Overall this place is definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"My husband are in Toronto on vacation and found Cora from an ad in our hotel's \"guest services\" book. We. Loved. It. The decor was adorable, and all near the kitchen area, it was surrounded by dozens of pieces of fresh fruit. All the signs were different and bright and colorful, it seemed clean, and there were a variety of people there, so it's good for anyone!

The service was admittedly a little slow, but the waitress was super nice, we were seated right away, and we were chatting with our waitress about us being from the US. We both got moccachinos, which were a nice balance of sweet and caffeinated. =) 

I got the seasonal Spring omelette, which has green apples, cheddar cheese, bacon, and a light drizzle of maple syrup. It was served with potatoes, toast, and freshly sliced green apples. The omelette was a great balance of everything; not too much of any ingredient- definitely a nice flavor blend. =)

My husband got the crepe panini with ham and swiss, and it was served with a *ton* of fresh fruit. I tried it and was impressed with the heartiness of the \"panini\", but also that it wasn't greasy or too heavy. The huge side of fruit definitely helped. 

We're here for 4 more days and will definitely be back for breakfast and/or lunch! :)"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Fresh food, large portions, and tastes great!  This is NOT the type of place to go to if you only like fatty fried frozen breakfast foods.....which can be good in their own right;)  But this is a place that embraces fresh fruit and fun food combinations.  I went for the first time this past Saturday....and then on Sunday again!  The place is MUCH larger on the inside than I would have thought.  It is bright and clean and has a non-stop line coming in and relatively fast table turnover.  The service is good unless you get a waiter in training....then be prepared to offer patience.  I have friends coming up from Houston and Las Angeles next month and will definitely put this place on the list of stops:)"}
{"text":"Great breakfast. I got the Cora's special: bacon sausage eggs pancake and toast. The food was hot and fresh. The potatoes were so good. And the service was quick and helpful."}
{"text":"Our experience was not good. Bad service.
1) The host got moody when we did not like the table at the door and asked for a booth (we were three people).
2) I ordered peppermint tea and got green tea. (I kept drinking it, thinking why does it taste weird until I saw the packaging).
3) We ordered a wrap with fruit that was okay... but then we asked a side plate that never arrived.
4) We ordered a \"Strawberry smoothie\", that didn't arrive. We asked for it again and orange smoothie was brought. We reminded that we ordered Strawberry, they answered \"Today we only have orange-mango\". Well, then why did you take an order for Strawberry!?
5) Kids meal was supposed to have scrambled eggs, tomatoes, fruit and bacon. The plate looked depressing: about 2 tsp egg, 1 tiny bacon piece and 4 huge tomato slices covering the whole plate. Will not return to this location."}
{"text":"Our favourite breakfast place in Pickering. The long lines are worth it. 
Great food, friendly servers. Fruit is always fresh and lots of options."}
{"text":"Wow, I'm surprised by the \"love it or hate it\" reviews.  Maybe this location is better than the rest?  Yes, it'll cost ya $20 for breakfast...but I figure all that fresh fruit is worth it.  I'd never even heard of a \"Chinese lantern\" cherry before, so I got fed AND learned something.  As for lineups, I've only gone at opening time (6am) on weekdays, so seating ain't been an issue.   Love the free copies of The Star.  The staff are cheerful (which is quite a feat at that hour).  I enjoy the variety....from an omelette inside a crepe to a poached egg on toast (memories of childhood!)  And did I mention the fruit?? My only qualm...I feel guilty eating so much fruit that is clearly not locally sourced.  Alas, if only farmers could grow grapefruit in Ontario!"}
{"text":"Cora's has a smoothie bowl now!! No acai unfortunately but still great! It's a nice change from all the carb heavy and meat options available. The smoothie base is a kale and mango (but you can't taste the kale) topped with granola, bananas, chia seeds, strawberries and coconut chips. The bowl was just the perfect amount of food for me - very light and refreshing. Would definitely order it again although I'd love to see more options for the base smoothie."}
{"text":"Always busy and always a line to pay so that only means one thing!! THIS PLACE IS GREAT drove 30 min to get here before we head to the airport."}
{"text":"Foods great. Waitress was very nice but took forever to come to us when we sat and when we wanted the bill. 
Ordered the strawberry pancakes. A bit skimp on the strawberry jam which cost extra if you want more. The tuna sandwich was delicious, the bread was perfectly toasted. There was a long line to get seated. Took about 10-13mins to get a table even though there were a few that were empty...idk. Also there's no where to sit while u wait for a table."}
{"text":"the greatest place to splurge a little for a delicious breakfast filled with beautiful presentations and sweet waitresses."}
{"text":"I could never say anything bad about Cora's...except a little expensive for breakfast food...but I still love you.  

It's hard to get a table and there usually is a line up....everyone who works here however makes my day...they're fantastic here, very nice polite and overall enthusiastic happy people.

I love all the fruit, and I have an allergy to Oranges and they always make sure that nothing on my plate touches it and there was one incident where I forgot to tell my waitress that I had an allergy to oranges and she took it back to the kitchen and made me a new one! YAY!

i Love this place...really all I can say.

Cost: 2 people, 2 mains, 2 coffee $35.
Food quality: 5/5
Food quantity: 5/5
Service: 5/5

Would I Go Again: I wanted to today but I slept in."}
{"text":"The place is big and the staff is friendly. I ate here last year and recently did a take out. The food was alright, nothing too great about it and nothing to complain about. The star deduction was coz while waiting for my order I ordered the 'Cora lemon green ice tea'. I got a small glass with ice and a small bottle that said Cora...ice tea. I guess I was kind of disappointed. I expected a tall glass with the ice tea in it, and also since it said 'Cora' I thought it would be more flavorful than the regular nestea...sadly it's not."}
{"text":"This review is mainly to point out the excellent service I received at this Cora's when I went for lunch yesterday.
Our server was friendly and attentive, and our food was delivered fast. While I didn't LOVE my meal, it was still pretty tasty. I always feel like there is a ton to choose from here but the reality is that there really isn't all that much and for some reason I always get the same thing....the Jo Breakfast (3 eggs/bacon/sausage). I want to try something more fun next time. 
The gentleman that was cashing people out at the front of the restaurant was awesome. My coworker was on a call and had a pen in his hand, the cashier was right there with a slip of paper for him to write on. He was also super friendly and knowledgeable. He didn't frown on me taking more than 1 complimentary Maple Fudge piece. Oh, and did I mention they had complimentary Maple Fudge!?!
These days, to stand out, it's the little things that count. These little gestures probably seem like nothing, but they certainly turned a run-of-the-mill business lunch into a nice experience"}
{"text":"Fabulous breakfast and service. Waffles, omelets, pancakes all were ordered at our table. Everything was excellent. Fresh fruit was also super delicious."}
{"text":"Not a big egg guy and every plate here has some sort of egg!

The staff was insanely friendly, being extra helpful to my mother while we ate and the fruit was very fresh and tasty. 

Just wish they had something without eggs..."}
{"text":"The breakfast is pretty standard, but the prices are almost double what you'd pay for breakfast at a similar restaurant that might not specialize in breakfast. The fresh fruit and presentation are above average, but for a restaurant with a cafeteria-meets-Denny's aesthetic and relatively unexceptional menu offerings , it seems a bit overpriced and underwhelming. That said, service was pleasant and orders were delivered efficiently."}
{"text":"I go to this Cora's every once in awhile, and it's always packed around lunch time.  Menu is annoyingly unique, i don't mind the eccentricities, but having some basics like pancakes or normal combo's wouldn't kill them.  That said i had some sort of panini concoction which was very good and i enjoyed the mound of fruit that came with it.

Prices are kinda high for breakfast and servers are rude everytime I go.  Showed up with the wrong food for my friend and after arguing about what she had originally ordered, they just left the (incorrect) food and said they were coming back with the correct order.  It never showed up, and no apologies or anything."}
{"text":"The food is simply ok. There's been times I've gone in and the service wasn't too great. On a non-busy day it's taken me time to get a seat even when there's multiple seats available."}
{"text":"My first Cora's experience was in Ottawa, and it was amazing.  I have been to many since but none were as good as my first time.  This place is no exception.  The food is good, the service is good, but just not quite how I remember it.  Last time I went the place was empty as if we had the place to ourselves.  It was kind of creepy, but hey, the food came quickly!"}
{"text":"Nothing memorial. We had a full breakfast here and service was a bit slow. Over priced and the venue was outdated. Located near Yonge and Carlton, it's located in a sketchy part of Toronto. If you're in the area, go to the Sennator instead for breakfast."}
{"text":"Extremely poor service from the waitress! This one table came after us and they endrd up getting their food way before.... 30 minutes later after ordering - I follow up with the waitress and asked her if \"she even entered our order in\" ... Oh let me check! Yeah you better check!! How much are you expecting me to tip you with such poor service. Every other waiter/waitress follows up! Would not recommend this location especially waitress Lisa!"}
{"text":"Dropped by at 6:30 AM on our way to Ottawa. We were the first one to arrive and they making the coffee when the 1st customer comes in so it will be fresh.

We ordered the 2 eggs 2 sauage breakfast and the bagel with mixed fruits.

The egg sauage breakfast is ok. But the Mixed Fruit is great! Awesome! Wonderful! There are so many different fruits there
- strawsberry
- Kiwi
- Mango
- Red Apple
- Green Apple
- Star Fruit
- Cantuople
- Honey Dew
- Grapes

The presentation is great. This is the only restaurant that I been to that offer all these fresh ones...! This is what I call variety and freshness.. 

It took a long time to arrive though... since they have to cut up the fruits when I place my order.

I wish I can have a fruit cup everyday... it is both delicious and healthy!

The service is friendly and attentive.. My coffee cup always got filled up without asking!

They accepts all credit cards."}
{"text":"Was looking for a filling healthy breakfast... Got more than asked for, could barely get out of my seat and almost went back to bed :)... The omelettes were great, fresh juices, coffee, ice mochas/lattes are delicious... And of course crepes are amazing !!! This place was super busy at 10 am... But we were seated right away..."}
{"text":"Cora's breakfast might be your jam if you are a breakfast person and not vegan, but definitely not the best choice for those who don't eat eggs.  I went here because it was the only place nearby serving brunch on Victoria Day and I was thankful for that, but options were non-existent without changes, which is a bit disappointing for Toronto.  Service was okay and the price was reasonable, but this is definitely not a place for me."}
{"text":"I was here twice, the most recent time was on Saturday for brunch.  The place was packed and it took us about 15 min to get a table for 4.  
Th atmosphere of the restaurant is very welcoming and friendly.
The service was decent in terms of speed, we ordered and the food was served within a reasonable time, although, they forgot one of the entrees at first.  The food tasted great, I love brunch/breakfast food for any meal of the day!"}
{"text":"I love Cora's.  The family that owns this location are wonderful people who treat their guests with tremendous hospitality.  The food itself is well prepared and fantastically generous.  The amount of fresh fruit that accompanies each meal is astounding.

As for favourites, I would have to say their Yogurt Harvest Crunch, Spinach Crepe and Tuna Melt are on top for me."}
{"text":"Service SUCKED! Pancakes brought to table with no syrup. Could not get waitress attention for A) syrup B) more water and coffee. Omelet was flat, not flipped. When time to pay me, along with other guests had to hunt down cashier. Would not go back."}
{"text":"I actually like Cora's in general. I've been to the Montreal location and to a location in Thornhill and another in Kingston. Overall pretty good. This location, however leaves much to be desired, unfortunately! I went once and didn't have a good experience; gave it another chance and again same thing, and now won't return. We get there and have to wait even though there were many tables available. They told us no booths were available although there was one that was sitting there dirty for a while. We asked someone and was resistant, she said she'll check... didn't come back. Then someone else approached us, seeing us waiting and then sat us quickly. I asked for my french toast to be cooked a little more than usual (just so that it wouldn't be damp). It came burnt. Also there was supposed to be a mountain of 'fresh' strawberries on top. It's a new offering. The strawberries looked horrible, like a pale pink colour and tasted really weird and were mushy. They were on the way to being rotten. I asked the waitress about the strawberries and she said that they're always fresh. I then ordered a side of potatoes so that I wouldn't be hungry after receiving burnt french toast and gross strawberries. Nothing was comped after our meal, not even the side of potatoes. Also my dad mistakenly forgot to order no cheese and when he told our waitress, the waitress did not offer to change it at first. Yes it was his fault but at other restaurants we're always offered a switch if there's an issue. Also the fruit is very hit or miss at this location. My dad's canteloupe was pale and not ripe. Overall bad service and not a good experience. :( For a consistently awesome experience I recommend the Senator near Yonge & Dundas. Cora's please shape up your quality of food & service!"}
{"text":"Not bad nor not amazing. Standard chain breakfast fare. A few unique options on the menu and quite a few choices to choose from. 

It's kind of overpriced for simple breakfast foods, Service was decent and prompt. 

I had a goat cheese, tomato and bacon omelette with rye toast. It was a filling breakfast with loads of coffee refills. 

I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here. But if I was in the neighborhood, I'd pop in. Both sweet and savory options caught my eye for next time."}
{"text":"This place was great and had original and fresh menu items. We ate there three times on our trip to Toronto."}
