{"text":"I only ate at the sushi bar.  Sushi was decent but over priced for the quality.  Nagiri comes in single servings but priced as a double serving.  I would not have an issue if it was exceptional but it is not.   I will eat here again but don't make a special trip for the sushi."}
{"text":"I may be spoiled by the good food where I live but I expected this to be decent considering the reviews.  Perhaps the grill food would have been better but I sat at the sushi bar, the sushi and seaweed salad were decent enough.  However the curry was like canned dog food, chunks of nondescript steak in a brown, canned like gravy (sorry, I couldn't eat much of it, and was hoping to have left overs for later that night but could not stomach eating it again).  The rice (how do you mess up rice?) was smeared/plastered on  the plate, perhaps with a spatula and had hardened, it sort of looked like the sample plate they leave sitting under the cover at a hostess station to show what the food looks like. The rice was cold and the dog food luke warm, I did ask to have it heated up, she brought it back very quickly, too fast to have heated it much, and it was still luke warm."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and nice service. The food was OK and a good value. I thought the preparation had way too much butter though. Butter was liberally added to the veggies, rice and chicken. The food was fresh and a big portion for lunch."}
{"text":"Over priced and small portions.  Bought a special roll and only got 4 pieces.  Ordered sashimi and pieces were small.  They use the bad tasting cheap type of ginger, and the taste of the rolls was nothing impressive.  I will not re-visit this place."}
{"text":"We went here for my brother's 30th birthday dinner and told the waiter it was his birthday. The food was average, but the customer service was horrible. The chef did not speak to us or do any tricks while cooking our food. We could have got the same food half the price, but we can here for a fun show. We saw great shows at nearby tables and when we asked where ours was, the guy said he was in training. We complained to the manager and she just said she was sorry and really didn't seem to care. Will not recommend, way to run a milestone birthday. $20-$25/person"}
{"text":"About what you would expect from a Japanese steakhouse. Portion was large and cost was what you would expect.  Chicken could have had more sauce and salad was not the best but all in all I will try again."}
{"text":"I asked the waitress to suggest cooked sushi combination.  There was one choice but had 22 pieces. I asked if I can order a substitute combo but with cooked sushi.  Her answer was either to select from the individual menu and there are no substitutes.  I did not order because of the total lack of willingness to accomodate.  I could have ordered single pieces and I am not knowledgable about sushi or wasted the food.  Perhaps since I was alone or came there the first time that they were very adamant and rude.  But clearly I am not having my company party here.  Did not eat the food so cannot comment on that.  But service was unacceptable. Ambiance is average,  a little musty."}
{"text":"NO MORE HALF PRICE SUSHI

Wasn't told till after I ordered, never eat there again.

They have half price sushi on Friday night, limit, 3 rolls per person and staff super rude. I took a date there and they messed up my order and the waitress walked off and never came back. Staff was super rude, 30 something female named Min I think. 

Messed up my order, super poor service and limited amount of food to purchase?? I'll just go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Typical Japanese Steak House and sushi bar. Food was well prepared. Sushi was fresh and beef tasted of high quality. Fast and friendly service. Would eat here again if/when I return to Charlotte."}
{"text":"Very disappointed
The worst sushi and tempura we have ever had!
This is the first time I have reviewed a resturant and felt it was so bad I needed to warn others.
Sushi was old and soggy and so were the tempura vegetables
Beer was warm and ginger dressing on the salad was tasteless
Must be under new mgmt
This is the first Yelp has steered us wrong"}
{"text":"Nice staff.  But our food was over cooked and several of us (including myself) got sick on the way home! I am STILL sick. Bathroom was DISGUSTING."}
{"text":"The worst \"sushi\" I ever had. Don't let the outside look of the building fool you. The food is terrible and you will lose your appetite the moment they the hand you the food. I ordered \"cooked sushi\"; what I received was avocado with unknown items wrapped around with rice. Where is the sushi???"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to stop here for dinner. Everything started out fine. Got our soup, looked a little dark but we still continued to enjoy. Husband liked the soup but I myself didn't. Cool cam out and proceeded to prep our meal. As soon as he cut the veggies, my husband saw something run acres the table. It was a BABY roach, which meant there HAD to have been more as well as their parents. Every restaurant has their issues but we decided not to eat at a place where a roach would eat off of the same place as us. Staff was friendly though."}
{"text":"Half price sushi on Friday's for lunch has become a fun treat some Fridays for my lunch break. The sushi is pretty good.  I'm biased because after noshing on sushi in San Francisco, nothing tastes as good here locally that I have found th4ere.  We did have an issue with the bill where they did not take the 50% off but it was quickly fixed. I was still a little shocked that we had to ask for that to begin with?  The service is decent and if you know anything about my past reviews, it weighs on my decision of stars pretty heavily. If managers don't take the time to train their staff to be attentive and quick, to me, it relates to how they operate as a whole. 

Is it good?  Yes, do I overwhelmingly suggest you make a point to come out and experience Kabuto?  No."}
{"text":"We went here on a whim. The chef at the table was very funny. We enjoyed the food and it was fast! The only con was I thought they did not give me enough food. This was the only time I have not had any left overs from japanese food. Maybe because it was so good!"}
{"text":"My co-workers and I stopped in for lunch on Friday afternoon. We were greeted by two friendly hostesses and seated right away. Our waiter arrived and we had our drinks in no time. The menu offered pretty standard Japanese Steakhouse choices including steak, chicken, shrimp and scallops. All entrees come with Miso soup, rice and veggies. Oh and let's not forget that they have half price sushi all day on Fridays!!!!

For my lunch I went with the Filet Mignon- it was cooked as requested and very tasty. I loved the veggies and rice in the teriyaki and shrimp sauce. Sooo good! And no worries about portion size here! They offer more than enough for a very satisfying lunch or dinner! 

My favorite part was and the preparation of our food. Our chef was fantastic! He was funny and high energy and just made the entire lunch fun for everyone. We all left full and happy and I'm looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. The first time was carry-out sushi, which was very reasonably priced and very delicious. They have great nigiri. The second time was two days ago for Hibachi lunch. YUM! I got the filet and scallops and it was deliciously flavored. The meat was so tender and cooked just right. The portions are perfect and will fill you up... though you might be in a food coma if you go on a work day like I did. Their red sauce is so good and you can ask for hot sauce if you need some. The service is very friendly and we were in and out in an hour. I highly recommend. This has been my favorite hibachi place in Charlotte so far!"}
{"text":"This is a LONG-TIME Japanese steak house in Charlotte , that seems to be in the midst of reinventing itself , while still holding onto it's original concept.  When you enter you have the option of sitting at a traditional Hibachi table or sitting at on the \"bistro\" side where you can enjoy sushi and more traditional Japanese fare.
I have done both and both are most pleasant- just depends on what kind of experience you are looking for.  
Friday is half-price Sushi night- you can't go wrong there.  They do a QUICK lunch service.  My only grip, and it's purely personal, is they don't serve mushrooms with their Hibachi- which I dearly love!  This won't keep me from going there but I will continue to request them, when I do.  
Definitely worth the trip for standard Japanese Hibachi."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service every time I have been here! Portions are huge! Love the filet hibachi meal!! And the yum yum sauce is YUMMY! Recommend this to all!"}
{"text":"The Sushi and food is ALWAYS excellent!!
Would certainly recommend if local or visiting! I come often and am never disappointed"}
{"text":"I visited Monida's Kabuto Japanese Steakhouse this past Tuesday night. The building is attractive; the parking lot a little rundown. It's located up a hill, off Tyvola Rd., in Charlotte's Westpark section. The sushi bar, behind the hostess station was pretty lively that night. I didn't do \"communal\"; I was a solo diner in conventional seating section. The Sapporo beer I ordered was refreshing. The main entree was the filet mignon-7 ounce. The meat was very tender. The rice was ok, if a little bland. The salad was very fresh, with a nice ginger dressing. The miso soup was ok. In all, a delightful, filling meal. Service was pleasant and unobtrusive. Pricing was fair at $31 and change. (I had the one Sapporo to drink.)
 As noted above, recommended at four stars. I'd go back, when back in Charlotte."}
{"text":"My experience this evening was basically flawless. I am a gluten free customer and eating Japanese is extremely difficult. The server went completely above and beyond to offer me options and he double checked everything to make sure it was safe. Often as a gluten free person you feel like a nuisance to servers because some people feel like its just a fad diet. They offered to take my gluten free soy sauce and prepare my food in the back. They gave me full portions and a great presentation. It's wonderful to know that even you can be accommodated even in a place with almost everything containing soy sauce. Our chef wasn't super personable but our server made up for it. I will definitely return to this restaurant and encourage others to try it. 

Note: Building sign says Kabuto, not what is listed on Yelp."}
{"text":"The deviled eggs and tofu were amazing and this is my second time here having the tofu.  But it shouldn't take 30 mins just order dinner and attempt... (I say attempt because she never came back to get a second drink order) to get another drink.  I ordered the tempura udon it tasted like it was out of the package actually I think the one for 2.50 tastes better.  They should write on the menu you get 1 soaked tempura battered onion ring that literally  falls apart when you try to eat it and two shrimps.  What a waste of $11."}
{"text":"Thank you Kabuto, for being next to the hotel that thought a vegetarian meal for me would mean taking off the chicken breast from the salad and serving me the salad. Yeah.

Also thank you for being present in a moment of need when some of us needed to get away from our terrible conference.

Service: pretty good.
Food: satisfying. We didn't expect much due to the location and the fact that were were demoralized and desperate.
Atmosphere: acceptable. It's in a shopping center in North Carolina.

They were fast and nice to us. That's what we needed. Thanks Kabuto."}
{"text":"This place was very good with large portions at the hibachi table. The spicy tuna roll was also very good. We would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Good food, typical of a \"flip your food\" Japanese steakhouse. Place was empty. Hibachi shrimp $23. Hibachi chicken $16. Exactly what you would expect but over priced for quality."}
{"text":"My fiancé and my favorite place for Friday night date nights! Such great sushi!! Try the dilworth roll! It's the best!"}
{"text":"Ate here while in town for Pride. It was very good, but all these Hibachi places taste the same to me, so while I was pleased it also wasn't anything special. The staff was super friendly and very accommodating. It felt like two restaurants in one, which was different! I am vegetarian and was VERY pleased our chef cooked my Hibachi vegetables first. I have had chefs at these places let the juice from the meat run all in my food. I was disappointed we weren't given sauces, like other Hibachi places though. We were only given white sauce, I had to ask for ginger, which is the only one I like. 

My friends ordered the Steak and Chicken, and the Ginger pork and they both raved over it. My friends said their drinks were very strong, too! Will be back next time I am in the QC!"}
{"text":"If you want sushi, the best day ever to go to this place is on a Friday.  Friday is half-priced sushi night, and you can get some of your favorite sushi, sashimi, and maki rolls for half the price.  Not all of theirs are on special that night, but the most popular ones are (most anything with tuna and salmon).  Pretty good sushi too, especially when you know it's half price.

I also love the hibachi part.  It's about the average price, and it's pretty much the same things you get at most Japanese steakhouses.  The best part of eating at any steakhouse like this is the show you get when they prepare your food.  The last time we went there, our chef created a two-foot tall flame - and I'm not exaggerating!  So fun, especially for kids!"}
{"text":"Bought this Obento Box at Bon Odori Festival today. It looked good, but didn't taste good. I hope I will not get sick later... $20 is too much for this. Low quality, high price meal."}
{"text":"This was my first hibachi experience, so I had no expectations. I actually got sushi, and my friend got hibachi, though we did share. 
Our chef was very entertaining, as well as making pretty good hibachi. The entertainment was fine, but here's what went wrong with the experience:

Sushi: Don't get me wrong, it was decent. However, EXTREMELY overpriced. I noticed that  they had normal prices for sashimi/nigiri, however it was just for one piece. $3.00 for one sweet shrimp? Seriously? Sweet shrimp are small! $2.50 for a piece of yellowtail? This is the most ridiculous pricing for sashimi/nigiri I've ever seen. I ended up getting a yellowtail roll and avocado roll (both very small for the price), and a spider roll. Though there was plenty of soft shell crab in it, it was extremely overcooked, which made it kind of unpleasant. Very disappointed on the sushi side of things.

Hibatchi: The salad and broth that came out before the meal were both very good. The person I went with was allergic to onions, and asked to just have white rice instead of fried. He was brought out a small cup of steamed white rice while everyone else at the table got a heaping portion of fried rice. The vegetables were fine, as was the steak. Like has been previously mentioned, cooked exactly to your specifications in front of you. The sauce that accompanied was also delicious. 

All in all, it was okay. Kind of lackluster for a first hibachi experience, and definitely when compared to the price. Also, their sushi is just ridiculous and not worth what they're charging. I suggest going elsewhere for both venues of food."}
{"text":"We went here once about a year ago and we were severely disappointed. However this week I was craving hibachi and this place is close by so I convinced my boyfriend to come back with me. 

We were promptly greeted and seated and did not have to wait too long to order. I ordered the hibachi chicken and the man ordered the ginger pork. The chef started with a standard show, but he was particularly friendly compared to other hibachi chefs. The show was standard with the usual display of the volcano onion and spinning egg. The only trick that was missing was the sake pouring into guest's mouths, but it is possible this was excluded because it was Monday and not a weekend night. They poured the sauces out of plastic bottles instead of trying to ladle out of a large container which kept the space nice and clean. I love when things are efficient like that. 

My chicken was pretty good but the ginger pork was the star of the night. I would never have ordered it myself but I definitely had some food envy! The portions were large enough that I had enough food to take to work the next day and the price was pretty standard for hibachi."}
{"text":"We waited 45 min for 3 people's orders of sushi, while the 4th person received their appetizer and entree of chicken and rice. There were also maybe 10 people in the entire restaurant"}
{"text":"At some point in the distant past (in a galaxy far, far away), I have to imagine that this Kabuto belonged in a hip and happening part of town.  I used to work not far away, however, and from 1998 until perhaps 2003, it wasn't.  It still isn't, in fact.  It has done nothing but go downhill.  It's amazing that they are still open.

If you want to go, I'd probably suggest lunch, because the dinner service is almost scary - it is scary if it's after dark.  The parking lot is a wasteland, and I live near Eastland Mall if that tells you anything.

In any case, the good news is that you don't have to wait long for a table at most times of the day, and you seem to get about the same amount of food at lunch or at dinner, though at dinner you get just a bit more food for a hefty increase in price.  If you visit regularly, give them an extra dollar and you can get a gold card where you get Kabuto Bucks that you can use to save money the next time you come back.

The food isn't authentic Japanese, but come on.  It's not like we have authentic Chinese or Italian or Mexican in most places in this country either.  It's just what we expect.  The show isn't really a show either - it's just a bunch of rattling around.  Usually you'll get a bit of spilled oil that is set aflame.  If you're lucky, you get a tossed egg cracked on a spatula.  Maybe a volcano made from an onion, and that's it.

What I find is that the food is pretty tasty - sure it's cooked in oil and a monstrous tub of butter.  But that's what makes it good.  The chicken is tasty, the steak is as well.  I'm not a sushi eater, but the California Rolls are good to my taste buds (better than you'll find on most buffets)."}
{"text":"We came here for a work party. The dual-table/grill in the back seats 15 very comfortably - I'm betting you could cram a few more in easily. They were definitely very accommodating to our large party.

Service was impeccable. These are definitely seasoned hibachi workers. The chefs were fun and friendly. The waitstaff were clearly very experienced with taking huge orders and maneuvering around tight spots between chairs and tables. No drink glasses went empty that I could see.

The food is the usual teppanyaki fare, nothing spectacular. It's rice and meat and veggies seasoned with a frightening amount of oil and salt and stuff. It's not bad at all. It never gets old watching them flip spatulas around and then toss flaming things into their hat or shrimps into their pockets. I think next time I'm in, I'll try the sushi. They also have red bean ice cream - YUMMM."}
{"text":"This place was known as \"Minoda's Kabuto at Tyvola\" but recently changed its name to \"Minoda's Japanese Steak House, Sushi Bar, and Izakaya\" in early July, 2012. I had been there before, years ago, but was very, pleasantly, surprised to see the new selections on their menu. I had never had, or heard of \"Izakaya\" before my latest trip over there. It's essentially a menu of small dishes, or kind of a Japanese Tapas menu. Very cool! Haven't seen anything else like it in the area. The sushi was great! I got a few \"off the menu\" pieces from the sushi chef, so that was pretty unique. All-in-all, I'd highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Do not go here for lunch!  I usually pack my murse with my lunch in it, but forget yesterday.  I decided to try this place out - I was extremely disappointed.

While I can't speak to their sushi, the lunch was weak.  First off, the rice was just cooked in soysauce and nothing else. It is like the $1 fried rice that you can buy from the places in LA - even there at least the rice has something in it.  The mixed veggies on the side were soggy from being steamed/cooked for way too long.  Also, the shrimp that I got (hibachi shrimp) was literally like a handful of the really small shrimps that come in a frozen bag.  I'd even say its worse because the frozen shrimp at least come without the outer casing.  Finally, the worst part is that the hibachi shrimp lunch special cost $13!  I don't mind paying that much if the portions are small but well-prepared.  Here, it was overpriced, meager portions, and the food was certainly lacking - I've had better at hospital cafeterias honestly.

I packed my lunch today, I'm not making the same mistake I made yesterday.

dmo out."}
{"text":"This was such a terrible dinner review for our family. We ordered the curry udon, shrimp fried rice, and fried udon. The fried udon was an absolute mess with some cabbage even uncooked. The curry udon was bland and plain and made with just some curry powder and udon noodles. It tasted terrible. The shrimp fried rice didn't even taste like a typical plate of fried rice. It tasted like a poorly cooked cheeseburger. I suspect that the cookware used to make the rice was contaminated with other food. The hostess also rushed us to make our decision, which we did not appreciate.

Overall, a terrible experience. We would NEVER recommend to anyone in our lifetime."}
{"text":"This location WAS the OTHER Kabuto's. I've found out by rubbing elbows at the sushi bar with the owner. The changed names to the current name. 

Nothing seems different as the prices look the same and the employee's as well. 

I ventured out yesterday (08/20) around 7ish for some sushi. 

I didn't want 2 order off the menu so I told the \"Sushi-Bartender\" to make me up something nice. Well well well.... he did. now what was it? I have no idea. But it had alot of fish and veggies. (see pix)

My girlfriend is new to sushi so she wanted something like a \"sushi for beginners\". He made her some kinda roll and it was pretty good as well. (no raw fish). Well by the time we tabbed out, the tab was running about 70 bucks so we had a good time. And left with our tummies filled.

They have  a nice bar as well."}
{"text":"5 Star reviews are hard to get out of me and a 5 star review for a sushi place means that everything was perfect.  I love sushi and my wife and I eat it regularly.  We had been to this place years ago when it was Kabuto and I remember it being really good.  On a whim I decided to stop in the other day for a quick lunch, and boy am I glad I did.

The name is a little confusing, but I get the impression that they are in the process of changing it to Minoda's although Kabuto is still on the sign and lots of other places inside.  The atmosphere is clean and Asian as expected.  The sushi bar is straight inside the door with the standard \"cook your food in front of you\" table/grills to the left.

The sushi was sublime.  We had a few different pieces of nigiri style sushi - yellowtail, white tuna, tuna, eel, and salmon.  We also had a rainbow roll which featured a number of different raw fishes as well as lots of cream cheese and draped with avacado.

The fish was so fresh, and perfectly cut that it literally melted in my mouth.  The chef here has some serious knife skills and it shows.  The rainbow roll was great as well, the rice was perfect, separate but sticky and seasoned just right, masterful preparation and attention to detail.

The star of the show was the eel.  I have had lots of eel and this was head and shoulders above all the rest.  meltingly tender, seasoned just right and grilled perfectly.  I will go back just for the eel, but of course, it will be impossible to resist all the other fare that Minoda's offers.

I am looking forward to trying Izakaya sometime in the future.  Do yourself a favor and drive to Minoda's tonight."}
{"text":"By far, the best hibachi I've ever had in terms of price, quality and quantity of food. I've been to some good places recently in Portland, ME, Charleston, SC and Urbandale, IA and Minodas beats everyone of them.

I go to Minodas everytime I'm in town (about every 6 weeks) and everytime I leave Minodas I leave satisfied. Their soup and salad is good (not hard to screw up but I've had others that have). Their gyoza is also very good but a little bit more doughy than what people may be accustomed to. But what really separates Minodas from everyone else is their main dinner. Their steak and chicken combo is amazing in both the quality of the food as well as the price you pay (about $22 I believe). The amount of food you get is the best value out there and yet the quality is top notch. I've told many work associates about Minodas and no one has left disappointed. The location is somewhat hidden and if it wasn't for being so close to work I probably would have never tried it.

There's lots of good places in Charlotte for hibachi but in my opinion Minodas is by far the best."}
{"text":"I would only give them a half star- I made reservations for a birthday. Upon arrival, I reminded them, and they informed me they were out of cake."}
{"text":"Your typical hibachi/sushi house, with very good if slightly overpriced food. Soup, salad and shrimp were great, NY strip hibachi seemed dry."}
{"text":"I had high expectations when we chose Minoda's for our Valentine's Day dinner. I called in to confirm the wait, the hostess insisted that there was no need for a reservation but I placed one anyways for 8p. We arrived at 8:10p and were seated right away. I was a little surprised to find such small hibachi grill stations which only seated about 7 people each, significantly smaller in relative to other places. What really irked me was the wait time for the chef to come out, about 45+ minutes AFTER being seated. We did the best we could distracting ourselves with eating soup and salad but we still were stuck waiting for a majority of the time. I was really disappointed that there was no fish/salmon option. 

Our server was not as good as I had hoped, he constantly got menu orders wrong which eventually lead to a setback with our grilled food. All of the people seated at our table requested specific vegetables included in their meal and extra meat, so I don't blame the server completely for the hold up. Apparently, the server had mixed up some orders which the chef had to fix while he was grilling the appetizer shrimp and friend rice. He actually had to leave the grill to get more veggies, this led to slightly burnt rice and shrimp. I must admit our chef was generous in portion size, but it really left with a crap ton of grilled onions and plain fried rice, was hoping for more protein. 

I'll probably be back once more just for good measure. Overall, this was just an ok experience, not what I was hoping for on Valentine's Day as it could have been a lot better."}
{"text":"This place isn't too bad, but I prefer the other one on Pineville Matthews (mainly cause they serve noodles) but I usually end up here, cause it's close to the hotel.  The typical meals will run you around 10-15 and it's a decent show, but it all depends on who your chef is.  I've definitely seen better, more interactive chefs at different hibachi places.

However, their 20+ king cut filet mignon is pretty amazing.  One great thing about these places is, you get the meat how you want it.  You can see how it is cooking and let him know when you want it.  The staff is friendly, but I agree that the lighting could use some work.  The lot is pretty dreary at night, so I wouldn't recommend leaving anything out in your car.

All in all, a decent place, if you are looking for a quick pseudo Japanese fix."}
