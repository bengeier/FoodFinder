{"text":"My wife and have been to jacks many times - big glasses of wine for the price. Beer prices are a good deal.  For some reason we keep coming back most of the time the food is very good. The wait staff and the hostess seem to be clueless.  Walked in and the hostess said we don't have anything available right now. I said can we put our name on the list. They looked at me like I had 2 heads. That night  My wife had the cheeseburger that came out raw. Waitress said I'll have them make another but they just microwaved the same one. The waitress seemed to get very  agitated and forgot that we were actually paying the check.  With a better trained waitstaff this would be a  very good establishment.  With all that said they do have many good things on the menu that would keep you coming back. I guess that is what brings us back as we overlook the waitstaff"}
{"text":"I went there a couple of Sundays ago and was astonished at the prices. It was $2 or $3 dollars for Mimosas ( I can't remember which) but cheap and good I do recall. Their fish tacos with spicy beans on the side were excellent too. We sat outside, it was warm and the patio was inviting. I highly recommend this place if your in the Cornelius area. It is more of a bar atmosphere then a restaurant but the food, prices and service were all top quality. This is a definite stop on my next .... \"Sunday morning coming down\" / had to much fun Saturday night / hangover cure quest. Very cool place!"}
{"text":"The food, the drinks, and the service all are good.  Everything I have tried from the menu, from appetizers to sandwiches and burgers to the entrees, have exceeded expectations.  Sometimes the music IMO is too loud, and often the selections are, well, unpleasant and out of sync with the diners.  But, it still is an enjoyable place to dine."}
{"text":"Some very good food (chili, fish sandwich, mashed potatoes, signature salad are great); comfortable, homey environment; really reasonable prices; good service; convenient location.   We've taken people there who liked it a lot.  Varied menu.

Flat screen t.v.'s throughout which can make it noisy and hectic when there's a game on.  Bar is adjacent to one area and separate from the other which is a good feature.

Reliable, local place with an open feeling.  Specials every day.

Overall very good restaurant."}
{"text":"We loved Heather's service! Food was great, too! We will definitely be going back. Great casual atmosphere. Burgers are to die for. Jack's signature salad YUM! Even oysters on the half shell. Fish tacos way good."}
{"text":"Over charging is still a problem, extra drinks are often added to the tab (rounds of drinks added when only 1 of 2 had a refill), I have tried to come back a few times over the years."}
{"text":"Third trip here...always just ho hum. Had a takeout Cuban for lunch today, pressed within an inch of it's life with only a millimeter of actual pork - if I wanted a ham sandwich, I'd have ordered one. Absolutely NO flavor, which is saying a lot for a sandwich with yellow mustard and pickles. The black beans and rice (the three grains that were in it) was decent, but nothing to rave about. 

Straight disappointment. This place is probably fine if you're drunk and don't care what you put in your mouth. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I was seriously craving a veggie sandwich (specifically, portobello mushroom), so I made the 20 minute drive to Jack's after finding them via Yelp. The sandwich was WELL worth the trip. The mushroom was a nice size, the spinach serving was generous, and the caramelized onions were cooked to perfection! The aioli sauce was just enough and the overall flavor was fantastic!  I will definitely make the drive again."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here last night with a group of friends. We're newer to the area and have heard mixed reviews about this place. When we came in the hostess standing at the front greeted us with a huge smile. They were full (Friday night) so the she put us outside. It had just finished raining so they went and got towels to clean the water off the chairs. In a hurried fashioned I might add. The waitress was out there immediately. 
After she got all of our drinks, she asked if we wanted an appetizer. She even told us her favorite one. All of our food was right. No one ever had an empty drink. The food was phenomenal and fast!! We were told about a \"yummy\" brownie for dessert but being my husband is a diabetic we declined. 
I most definitely would come back again! The only small complaint I have is that when I couldn't remember the waitress' name, I went to look at the receipt but the name on there wasn't hers.. More like a nick name. Seemed a little unprofessional BUT nevertheless, that's the only complaint I have. We will be coming back!"}
{"text":"So my husband and I were really hoping this would become our Wednesday night neighborhood spot. Half off draft beers yo, can't beat that, right?? We've come a few times and food is ok, service is slightly better than ok. However last Wednesday  was the death blow. We get our check and they've charged husband  full price on the 4 beers he had. We figured out why the bill was so high and when my husband pointed it out to the bartender-instead of just paying it like they hoped we would-she said, oh...so do you want me to get my manager to re open the bill and fix it? 
LOLOLOLOL NO!! Sorry, we actually do want to be overcharged. OUR BAD. 
Mmmm yes, sugar, we would actually like you to fix it. Thanks. So her manager did. I watched her do it, 15 minutes later, after ignoring us for a bit-the bartender brought the correct bill around.
Paid. Done. Never again. I'll leave that bar to the old LKN dudes trying to relive their youth."}
{"text":"We frequent this restaurant and bar. Have always had wonderful service and food is typically amazing. only negative experience we've had was on a Sunday at brunch. Manager was awesome though and took care of our issue quickly. Will definitely continue our patronage."}
{"text":"Not so good service at the bar, never sat at a table. 
They're food is pretty good (their claim is they're a gastropub, but really, I haven't had anything there you can't get at applebees) but the blonde highschol aged bartenders that just stare at you blankly when you ask questions seriously have to go.

The common crowd is the 35-55 married crowd. Which is funny, because on multiple occasions I've seen men getting caught by their wives for being out with another woman, getting dragged out of the bar in a fury of rage. So points for people watching for sure. 

My main peeve with this place is, also on multiple occasions, my bar tab is drastically over-rung. Both in quantity and price. If a beer is on special for $3, check your receipt, you're probably being charged full price, and seriously charged for more than you've had. When you ask the bartender about it, they either argue with you (even though that same bartender told you the specials an hour ago, along with them being posted) or pretend they had NO CLUE you were drinking the special beers all night. Drop your blonde act, you're purposely over ringing me.

Its fine, but this isn't a place I generally choose to to go to, mostly because I loathe bartenders that try to drive their tips up by doctoring up your bill, then claim they didnt understand and stick out their boobs. It probably usually works or it wouldn't happen to me so much.

ALWAYS REVIEW YOUR RECEIPT BEFORE PAYING."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting!!! We've been here twice. The first time I found a hair in my kale salad today we decided to give it another try and found a long brown hair today in my chicken Cobb salad? When we told the waitress she said she would take off the salad off the bill and didn't seem at all phased by it. They must get this complaint a lot. Done with this place. They need to invest in hairnets!!! Even if they did we're never going back!!!"}
{"text":"Customer service here is horrible!  The food is good, maybe have the kitchen staff work the front too!?!  I have talked to management several times with no change, time to try something new."}
{"text":"This place is located in a strip mall and has plenty of parking. It wasn't crowded at all when we got there so we got to sit in a nice comfy booth. I had the BBQ sandwich with sweet potato fries and it was really delicious!! It came with a side of sauce & a dipping sauce for the fries. It's a fun place that would be perfect to come with friends to grab some food and get some drinks."}
{"text":"Jack's Corner Tap is a new establishment in the Lake Norman neighborhood of Cornelius, I think they've been open less than 2 weeks at time of this review.

Wife and I visited for lunch yesterday, was surprisingly crowded.  Lot's of flat panel TV's line the ceiling line of the combined restaurant / bar area.  

Menu is simple but good, with the normal variety of bar food and snacks, as well as entrees and salads.

I had wings (Nuclear) and a wedge salad, Wife had a portabelo sandwich and sweet potato fries.  Wings were juicy and not totally slathered in sauce, sufficiently flavorful.  Wedge salad was basic, but fresh and crisp.  Wife's sandwich was good, as evidenced by it's disappearance.

Reasonable beer on tap selection, which is a nice addition to the neighborhood, reasonable prices and good service.  

Give them a try!!"}
{"text":"I really, really, really want to like this place as the location and actual structure is great. But...I just cant.
I have been here approx 10 times (which is my own fault) and the 'cons' of this place are very consistent.

Service: HORRIBLE! When you walk in you will note a gaggle of women chatting around the hostess station. If you are lucky they might follow you to a table with a menu. If you actually need a refill- then you must resort to aggressive tactics. I just don't think they hire qualified food industry servers. But they do wear low cut shirts to try and make up for skill level (at least it's something). The gals can  normally be found hanging at the hostess station, bar area or in the back service area. The bartenders from a skill point of view are laughable, but they will lean over the bar and laugh and talk loudly about themselves. So that leaves a lot of people amused. 

Food: *sigh*. Every now and then a nice soup special or something is delightful. However the staples of pub grub are really a bummer. Just yesterday we ordered nachos and collecting at the bottom was a soupy mixture of oil, water and nacho cheese. As a personal note, I think it is a crime against humanity to not use shredded cheese on nachos- but that is just me. The wings are slimy. Burgers and sandwiches can often be decent. I get the wedge salad from time to time, which is entirely too much lettuce for the amount of toppings/dressing. 

Honestly-  get a new chef and staff and I will REALLY love to try this place."}
{"text":"Great Food, Great Staff! Not only do I frequent there for lunch, I order food for our employees for Sat. lunch. Rad and his staff are the best."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to eat, decent burgers nice waitresses and the service is OK. It is a little loud in there but nice comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"Thank you.  I frequent all your other locations in Charlotte and never had an experience like this one.  I will give this location another opportunity in the near future."}
{"text":"Super, super mediocre. Good spot to watch the game as they have a lot of TV's to watch. The service is spotty. Wednesday is 50 cent wing night I believe, which is a good deal. They usually have decent drink specials, but outside of that, this place is not really worth it. Al's a few seconds away is a better option. Burgers are mediocre as is everything else. I got the Cuban sandwich on this trip which was very mediocre. I could make it just about the same with little effort. I also didn't appreciate the extra charge for fresh fruit, which really wasn't that fresh. I may come back for drink specials or wings, but that's probably about it. Go to Al's down the street instead."}
{"text":"Right from the second you walk in this place will piss you off.  I say this because you can't get the attention of the non friendly hostesses for one second because, they and the other girls are too busy talking to one another and looking at their phones.  Not to mention my girlfriend and I waited for an hour and a half for a two person table that we never got (gave up and stood at the bar).  The food is so so for the price, you get what you pay for. I overheard several people say that was the worst meal they ever ate.  The only reasons this place gets two stars at all are because of the very attentive bartender Stacy and the fact that there is not a single direction you  can look in that doesn't have a tv.  Other than that the owners need to get better cooks, ditch the tween hostesses and focus on quality staff like the bartender."}
{"text":"one of our favorite neighborhood spots.. The food is spot on and reasonably priced. Had the roast beef special last night .  Yum.."}
{"text":"Recent (last week) visit noticed most wait staff gone and new floor management.  Service horrible and attitudes to match.  Got our order wrong and didn't seem to care.

Someone made a bad management mistake. 

Will look for a new place now."}
{"text":"Great number of TV's for sports watching. Not a bad place. Food doesn't really stand out, but some good items worth a gander, Philly steak and cheese egg rolls!."}
{"text":"Good food, great service. Only problem I had was $8.00 for a mixed drink that is 95% mix and juice. Not very happy with that."}
{"text":"They redeemed themselves! Like night and day difference from the last time we where here. Our waitress, Emily, was excellent, polite and on top of things. Our food was cooked perfect and the staff was very accommodating. Great come back!!"}
{"text":"I keep trying to like this place because it's convenient and the bar staff is friendly and efficient.  However the food keeps bringing me down.  Tonight I tried the baby back ribs.  They were dry as a bone.  No pun intended.  The Cole slaw was totally devoid of flavor.  I guess after 5 or 6 attempts I'm ready to accept that Jack's is  a good place to get a beer and watch sports but I need to go elsewhere when chow is to be enjoyed.  I wish they'd raise their game as the potential is there."}
{"text":"It's been almost 2 years since our last visit here, see my last review of Jack's.  It seems that nothing has changed much since then. It was 1/2 priced wine night so we thought we'd give the place another go round and order a bottle of wine to go with the Lasagna special. My wife and I came with some neighbors this time in the hope that maybe things had gotten better. Our hopes were dashed. I didn't mention our last trip here to our friends so I wouldn't taint any perceptions. Jack's wait staff is still very nice but the same problem arose with their glasses again.  They were kind of busy and service was a bit slow. When the wine did arrive the waitress poured a sample to taste. Of course after the first visit I checked my glass. This time not only was there orange pulp, but lipstick! I brought this to her attention. She apologized profusely and brought us new glasses and more wine. NOPE, more pulp and more lipstick. I called the manager to the table and shows him. He had a hard time finding us 4 glasses that were clean enough to use.  Long night, this is for sure the last visit to Jack's. Oh, by the way, the Lasagna was adequate at best."}
{"text":"Not very good service tonight.  Been coming here for 6 years and love this place.  When Abby is not there the place goes downhill from a manager standpoint.  The guy  manager was sitting down while the waitress were busy. 

My order got screwed up and it took forever to get our food."}
{"text":"Stopped by on Sunday afternoon.  Four of us.  Three ordered hamburgers, two medium with chips and one medium rare with well done fries.  Fourth ordered Reuben.  Waitress comes out with Reuben and three burgers.  All have chips.  I ask how she knows which one is medium rare.  It was like I asked her to do long division in her head.  She says we all ordered well done.  Not close to true.  I point out I ordered well done fries.  She leaves two barely edible burgers, no condiments.  After a while, I decide to go into the restaurant and attempt to find condiments. Our waitress is nowhere to be seen.  The restaurant is a mess.  I ask another waitress if she can get some catsup and mayo for the burgers.  Eventually our waitress comes out with condiments.  Of course, the well done burgers are now ice cold and the chips are awful. Buns stale.  Should have sent the burgers back. Mine eventually comes out and it is good as are the fries although not remotely well done.  Everyone is done eating by the time my food arrived.  Last time for me."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Thought it was going to be hard to find something for me to eat because I'm vegan, but the mushroom sandwich was very good. The bread doesn't have dairy and I asked for no aioli. Very good!"}
{"text":"Great luck with this place. Service is as bad you could ever possibly imagine. I'm not speaking of only slow. I want to apologize to the bartender for having to take my beer order but I do appreciate you separating yourself from your personal conversation to do so. Cheers!!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch or to go after work, great prices on food and they are always changing the menu and offer daily specials.  Love the fish tacos!  Chili has a different twist- no beans.  Tomato Beefsteak Salad w/ Green Beans and Mozzarella will be coming into season- excellent!.
Not to mention all the sports on the monitors!"}
{"text":"I have NEVER had an unpleasant dining experience her. Every plate I've ordered is beyond excellent. So flavorful that I never touch the salt/pepper shaker. Today I had the chicken club sandwich which was juicy & tender. Plus  the greens was better than my momma's (shhhh, nobody tell her that) and *drool* the mashed potatoes. Obviously I can't finish a coherent thought...just YUM & kiss the cook!!!"}
{"text":"Loved this place at first, and went several times a week. After getting the fried okra still soaking in oil several times.... we're done. Service is hit or miss too."}
{"text":"We wanted cheap drinks and to enjoy the summer weather.

Cheap drinks were successfully received. $2 Mimosas on Sunday.

Enjoying the weather was difficult. With no fans, not ceiling nor standing, the patio was a humid prison of sunlight and heat. 

The patio speakers were not working, so it was like a library. Whomever spoke, everyone heard.

Alexis was a server worthy of accolades."}
{"text":"I definitely recommend this place. I've been there 4 times and been very satisfied. The service was very good, I'm very picky about service. The 4 stars is based on the venue. This is a sports bar, with waitresses wearing very short shorts. It is not a gourmet restaurant. The food is solid for this type of restaurant. You most certainly get your monies worth. 
My only complaint is the French fries. They use the fries processed with some kind of crunchy outer coating. I actually was kinda happy I don't like them. I'm trying to shed a few pounds. The natural fries are much better!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Upscale Bar Food

4th of July and we decided to grab a quick dinner before the fireworks.  My wife and I have been coming here since they opened a couple of years ago and this is one of her favorite places.  I like it too and with the exception of the Oyster Po Boy, the food is generally good. They have never mastered that one.

I had the Prime Rib which was one of their daily specials. It was excellent and great cut of meat.  Only downside was the salad that came with it.  Lettuce was limp and the balsamic dressing left much to be desired.  My wife had Philly Cheese Steak Wraps which she enjoyed and even brought the leftovers home for a midnight snack.

Service was excellent.  They just took over the space next door and expanded the restaurant and the remodel came across well.

Good casual place to go.  Plenty of wide screen TV's so it's a nice place to catch a game or in todays, case, NASCAR at Daytona.

Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I would love to write a nice review, but as I recently had my third bad experience in a row sitting in the bar area at a high top table. I like the atmosphere, great beer selection, pretty good food. The servers are clueless. Not the bartender, the waitress's"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by Jack's Corner Tap. My friend and I were just looking for a spot to grab some lunch and watch the UNC football game. We landed on Jack's and were expecting just some run of the mill Sports Bar food. Jack's ended up impressing us. 

I got the Bonsai Burger which had bacon, swiss cheese, pineapple, and was marinated in teriyaki sauce. The burger ended up being juicy and delicious. As my side, I got the homemade chips which were cooked just right and came with some delicious ranch. Also, Yelp has a check-in offer that gets you a free appetizer with the purchase of two meals. We went for it and got the Loaded Tater Tots. This wasn't just a little sampler that they brought out. They brought out a huge pile of tots topped with sour cream, guac, jalapeños, diced tomatoes, and more. Definitely take advantage of this. 

They have a good amount of options on the menu, considering it's a sports bar. This is the type of place that you could find something on the menu for just about anyone. This is also a great place to watch the game. They have TV's everywhere that the eye can see, and a number of large projectors. 

The service was great. Our waitress was attentive and very helpful when we wanted to turn on the UNC game on a TV that was closer to our table. I saw them accommodate several patrons who had a specific game that they wanted to watch. The beer selection isn't great, but they have a good number of local options, including some choices from NODA. 

If you are in the Lake Norman area and are looking for a place to watch the game and grab a bite to eat, Jack's Corner Tap is definitely the place."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Jack's since it opened. Love the tacos. Unfortunately lately the crowd seems to be meeting there to talk not eat or drink. We have had to wait 30 minutes or more to get seated while we see people that have finished their food and drinks just talking worse is when we see the manager have his friends taken to a table when they come in after us. The last visit a table was empty when we arrived but we were told there was a waiting line. We waited five minutes and them were seated in that same table. The next quests to arrive we're seated immediately.  We are going to find a new place for tacos"}
{"text":"Great food and decent prices. The Sangria was awesome. I really liked the crab cakes, they were more than just bread filling. Steak and cheese egg rolls were a hit too. Sat out on the patio and it was perfect....well except for all the smokers. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great new addition to the Lake Norman area!

What I liked:

Friendly staff
Great variety on the menu
Excellent decor
Lots of TVs
Impressive beer selection and specials

What I didn't like:

I had to leave and couldn't stay longer"}
{"text":"My wife and I were there for a late lunch today.  My wife ordered a salad with blackened chicken.  The first attempt came with uncooked chicken.  They did remove and replaced it with a properly cooked chicken.  By the time it arrived I had completed my burger.  Which was very good.  I was disappointed that we were not compensated at all for the inconvenience.  We won,t be coming back."}
{"text":"The wings are good, the TV's are on the wall, the waitress brings water often. I like this place. My ribeye was the least flavorful, leanest, most industrial grade of meat I've been served. It was simply not a steak. Alyssa, our waitress, was terrific. The bouncer is intimidating, psych. The mustard was hard to open. Thank you Jack."}
{"text":"I just realized that I have not Yelped this spot.   The food is above average sports bar food.   I have never had a bad meal there.........   Keep in mind, it is a quasi sports bar - combined with nightly food and drink specials, makes for a busy place.   They have done a good job remodeling, but even with the open side seating area, there is usually a wait.

My family and I have been doing Thursday night $5 burger night.   It's five bucks, build your own burger.   Choice of side.   Their fries rock, extra crispy and very good.    My family usually gets the burg with bacon, avocado, sautéed onions and cheddar cheese.  You cannot beat it!!!!!!  What has really frost my ass, they used to have $3.50 local draft on Thursday, that was a rocking deal, but no more...... sniff sniff.

So, other misc. comments.   Wings are decent, above average.  Nachos rock, I think they use real velvetta, its nice and creamy, yum yum.   HINT - they ran a Yelp Check In offer for a free app last year.   It came up last week when I checked in....... Saweet.   Seared Tuna app is small, but really great.

5 star for local craft beer, rotating taps.   Yum Yum.  Dilly dilly.  Cheers.

On a bad note, they get so busy, the servers have to work there ass off, every server my family has ever had, has never been friendly or even smiled.   By no means, was service bad, maybe slow at times, but their face would break if they smiled."}
{"text":"This place is okay. They have expanded their dining area and it's a nice atmosphere. The food is decent. The service was decent as well. I'd say this is a place I will come back to every now and then."}
{"text":"I WILL NEVER BE BACK! After seeing a cockroach on the floor. Bringing it to the managers attention and him saying \"there's nothing I can do\" what awful awful service!"}
{"text":"I'm in here weekly, and I have to say the Jacks Salad with Salmon is fabulous! My fav."}
{"text":"Bar is not my favorite. Food is pretty good sometimes. Management is sub-par."}
{"text":"If you don't expect much, and you have like a TON OF TIME...this is the place for you...not gonna say the food is terrible, b/c how really can you screw up BAR FOOD? ...and yes, wings are good here,make sure you say xtra crispy-well done...or you will be sorry...burgers are decent, it drives me crazy they have a $2 taco night for tacos that are worth $1, service is S    L     O    W...if you have a time frame to eat...skip it...they do the BAR thing really well, although I ordered a margharita once and it was something awful...none the less, a burger, a beer, and all the TV's anyone could want...makes this place great, as long as you have the time to spend..."}
{"text":"After a few sub-par visits in recent weeks that I would have rated 2 stars (\"new manager,\" we've been told), our group of four had a great experience tonight with Kate as our server. Everything came out correctly, on time, and was tasty. Hopefully they can iron out whatever they're working on and use Kate as an example of how to take care of patrons.

Thanks, Kate (and kitchen), for getting it right tonight!"}
{"text":"Ambiance is nice, but food just ok.  Waitress was very rude. She slammed drinks in the table and then double charged my card.  Disappointed. I won't be back."}
{"text":"This has been a place I've visited on a couple of Sundays and I just have to say they have $2 mimosas which in the greater area is one of...if not the best...deal around.

Fish tacos are ok and the dish comes with 2 and a nice big bowl of beans, so plenty of food.  Menu has very reasonably priced dishes.  Add in a nice patio for warmer months and plenty of TVs inside, it is a nice go to place for eating, drinking, and viewing games.

FYI:  Huntersville Police do run road blocks on the back road between this place and Macs Speed Shop at night sometimes...........beware!!!!"}
{"text":"Great selections and food.  Only place I have found a good cuban sandwich on real cuban brrad. Lots of sports screens. Salads great."}
{"text":"Always great service and great food! Never had a bad experience here. Fun bar to grab drinks at as well!"}
{"text":"Always fun and lively crowd. Live music on Friday nights @ 9:00pm. Lots of drink specials.  Portions are generous.  Waitstaff is well trained, friendly and attentive.
We enjoyed a free appetizer courtesy of checking in with Yelp and ordering 2 meals. Woo-hoo!  Had the tuna appetizer-yummy!  Burger perfectly medium-rare.  Veggies fresh a d cooked right without losing crispness.  A definite \"Yes!\""}
{"text":"On the way back from a panthers game, my family and I decided to stop here. Big mistake. As we walked in, we were barraged with noise. The speakers were on absolutely full blast, and thus conversation became next to impossible. I asked the hostess if we could move to the other section out of the way of the TVs blaring in our ears. She rudely simply said no. The service was slow, my dad's drink was forgotten, the staff was inattentive. The only redeeming quality was the food. It was actually pretty good. The only way I would ever recommend it is if you're too drunk to care about the noise, or you're a rude teenage girl looking for a job."}
{"text":"Phone keeps checking me in here when I'm at the grocery, figured I ought to at least stop in for a look.
For better or worse it's a neighborhood bar and eatery. Daytime barkeeps are friendly enough and seem to know just about everyone coming and going. TVs are everywhere as distractions but not competing with the piped-in music. Not sure what Jack intended but it has comfortably settled into this :-)
$2 tacos on Monday: choice of steak, chicken, fish, other fish... Went with the grilled fish and am pleased; real chunks of fish, tomato, and fresh crunchy cabbages on cool soft fresh tortillas. Doesn't really need it but 'Yea Tabasco!'
Guessing the bar and the restaurant use the same kitchen. So based on today's effort I would consider dining in."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good but the service was less than desirable. The waitress greeted us without a smile. As she walked away, we both said \"Thank you\" with no acknowledgement. The food came out relatively fast. I had to make a vegetarian taco because there wasn't one on the menu. The sautéed veggies were huge chunks of squash, broccoli and carrots.. But tasted really good. My husband had the shrimp taco (which he loved) and the fish taco (which he took one bite of and put to the side). By the end of the meal, the waitress was at least partially smiling but still cold and not very friendly. My husband and I work in the service industry so we understand that everyone has bad days and bad guests. We can over look most things. But the one thing we can't over look is a waitress who sits at a table in front of us chatting to a friend while we need things to enjoy our experience. We counted 5 separate times this happened and there wasn't a manager in sight. Needless to say, this will not be our first choice when we dine out."}
{"text":"I wasn't optimistic when I approached the front door and found a big mat with a decent-sized hole in the middle. I guess they don't care much about first impressions. Then again, this lowered my expectations. 

I was meeting a friend and arrived early, so I had a draft beer at the bar. The bartenders were friendly and on top of their game. The negative was some drunk guy (50-something) making rude comments to the female bartenders, spilling his drink, and chucking coasters across the bar at the bartenders. He was an ass. I mean, does the guy really think he's going to get a 20-something female when he's 50-something, drunk, immature, and sporting a bowling ball beer belly? Reality, man!

When my friend arrived, we talked for a while, then ordered pretzels and mild buffalo wings. Both were excellent. On the other hand, the menus were dirty and not in good shape. Very contradictory with the quality of the food. 

When we were leaving, a guitar player began playing on the patio. Perfect night for it. And he was talented. 

Overall, service and food were great, cleanliness was not. Your call."}
{"text":"I could not say enough good things about this place...I work close to here so its my lunch place..if I lived here it would be my dinner hang out spot too....the Manager down to the cooks are all outgoing and friendly and the food is always on point."}
{"text":"Came in here for a quick lunch (very quick, we managed to get in, eat, and get out within about 20 minutes. Eek!) and were seated quickly. I could imagine this place would get wild during a game with the amount of TVs on the wall, so I'll have to come back for that!
Our waitress was super nice, attentive, and communicated well with us. I ordered the korean chicken sandwich (I think...just checked their online menu and it's messed up - it lists something with brisket and sloppy joe sauce) and it was okay. I liked the flavors on it, but jeez guys, have you tried eating that? The pieces of kim chi on it are way too large to a) stay on the sandwich and b) it overpowers the chicken a lot. 
I definitely want to come back and try other things, and maybe even come here to watch a game, but that one sandwich didn't quite do it for me."}
{"text":"Excellent food, new/clean feel, great TVs for games. Solid waitstaff. Free Wi-Fi!  Solid support of Chicago teams ;)"}
{"text":"I thought the place was pretty nice. Daisy Duke waitresses (or a lest our was)  the soup was good, beer good. The wings did not really taste like buffalo wings but after were wondering if we got the wrong sauce. It was hot and red but more like peppery.  Loved the decor and shocked at how many TV's they have. It seemed pretty crowed for a Tuesday."}
{"text":"Terrible food I've ever had. Such a shame because it's a great place to hang out. Maybe some day they'll get a new chef."}
{"text":"As long as they have been open, I don't believe I've ever met anyone that has had something negative to say about Jacks.  These bad reviews are a joke and should be removed.  If you want your typical boring menu, than you should probably go somewhere else.  Jack's menu rocks.  The staff rocks.  The atmosphere rocks.  Cheers to Jacks!"}
{"text":"This used to be our favorite restaurant. We went several times a week. The food is good,  the atmosphere is good, the kitchen is constantly backed up, the hostesses do not manage seating well, and the service is horrible.  It takes forever to get your food.  They are often out of menu items.  They took Guiness and Miller Lite off tap.  On our last visit ($5 burger night) we sat outside, got there around 8pm.  Our waitress came quickly to the table to take our order,  however when we told her we were ready for drinks and food she said she needed an order pad and went back inside.  It took a very long time for her to return.  After taking our order (4 burgers & chix sandwich) we did not see her again for 45 minutes.   We went to the bar to order drinks and told the bartender that we hadn't seen our waitress then we went to the hostess stand and asked them to send someone to our table,  still no waitress.   Our food never came and we got no drink refills. After being there a full hour we decided to leave.  Our waitress found us then and told us our food would be right out. We told her to cancel it. When we asked to speak to a manager, she was one of many who had walked by our table several times.  The table next to us who sat at the same time,  ordered, ate and finished  their meal in this time. We won't be back.  This is the 3rd bad experience in a row.  Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"I've been several times. The staff is very friendly. The food is pretty good. The Bloody Mary bar on Saturday mornings is epic!!!! The brunch is tasty!!! Decent selection on the menu."}
{"text":"We were looking for a quick, last-minute bite to eat in the area and saw Jack's coming up. Since we hadn't been there yet we figured we would check it out and see what Jack's was all about.

We walked in and were greeted immediately. Since it was a nice day out we decided to sit outside, which was probably good because the interior seating looked pretty limited and cramped. The outdoor patio is nice and spacious, and I would recommend sitting out there if the weather is nice,.

The menu is your basic pub food, with sandwiches and salads and whatnot. I went with a plain cheeseburger ($8) which was ok. It was cooked to a medium well so it was a bit dry but still had a good beefy taste. For a side I paid the extra buck to upgrade to sweet potato fries, which were really tasty. They came with some kind of sugar glaze sauce to dip the fries in and it was pretty gross...I don't recommend using it.

The missus' got the fish sandwich ($9) which was just a grilled fish on bread. The fish tasted pretty fresh and had a nice seasoning on it. She also got the sweet potato fries and likewise enjoyed them.

Jack's isn't a culinary experience by any means, but it's a decent place to grab a beer and burger. Personally I don't see myself going back with Duckworth's in the area, but I wouldn't be against going back if someone really wanted to go."}
{"text":"Started coming for trivia, lots of fun, you win prizes like gift cards. Mozz sticks are great! Goat cheese salad was eh, burgers are good! Our new tues spot!  
...update... sad to see the trivia go :( will be heading to the new location on tues nights"}
{"text":"We've been interested in trying Jack's for a while now.  The Yelp reviews were mixed and our experience reflected that same mix with some good and some just average to below.  The atmosphere is like a darker version of most sports bars with lots of TVs all around.  The food ranged from not bad - Wedge salad with what appeared to be housemade blue cheese dressing - my wife's blackened fish tacos to below average - my cuban sandwich and the clearly frozen, out of a bag onion rings on the side.

Seems to be a hangout for an older crowd (I can say that as I'm part of that crowd). All in all, I might come back sometime to watch a football game or something but Jack's won't be on our regular rotation of LKN stops."}
