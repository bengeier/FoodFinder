{"text":"They serve sashimi for weekday lunch which is rare for most sub $15 sushi buffets.  Worth trying and judging for yourself."}

{"text":"One of my families favorite japanese restaurants . All you can eat lunch or evening buffets , the selection is great , we've never been disappointed  with the quality and taste , overall really great value for money."}
{"text":"I went to eat today as I was in the area. After carefully looking for different AYCE places I decided to go here. The main reasons why I gave it four stars only is a. Parking space is limited and you must pay for it which adds on the bill and b. Because the service is super slow and being in two floors take them forever to go up and down. 
Other than that the food was AMAZING and took advantage to eat a ton of yummy food as I was starving and quite impressed with the quality, variety and flavour. The only thing I was not impressed with was the Pad Thai as it tasted like it had ketchup sauce diluted as opposed to tamarind sauce how the authentic one is supposed to be. When I asked why it tasted so fake they added that it was a Japanese version, then why are they claiming to be a Thai restaurant too? If I was them I would stick to the Japanese because their food is EPIC! For only $14.95 for lunch you can't go wrong. 
Aside from that I love that the pop was only 50 cents and that they give you 5% discount for paying cash. I definitely encourage you to bring cash for more savings. Last but not least, the fact that sashimi is part of their buffet is AMAZING as not all AYCE restaurants include that for lunch; most do it for dinner only as of course serving that is more costly."}
{"text":"Great food and really nice service. I like how the cooks greet you when you arrive. 

The sushi is done really well. The lunch all you can eat is really really good value for money."}
{"text":"A great affordable lunch menu to those working and living in Oakville. 

The 2-3 Roll Combination is a great deal."}
{"text":"This is my favourite AYCE sushi restaurant. I love the ambiance. It has beautiful wooden carvings when you first walk in. You can either go down the stairs and eat while watching the chef make sushi or go upstairs. 

The sashimi is always fresh as is all their rolls. I really enjoy the spicy salmon and all of their specialty rolls. There's even an Oakville roll! I'm allergic to shrimp, so it was nice to find a sushi restaurant that had of rolls that didn't include shrimp. 

Their tampura is delicious and never soggy or too greasy. I also really enjoy their fusion menu - everything from lemon chicken to short ribs to pad Thai. It is all delicious! Most of the portions are quite large and can serve 2-4 people, so it's better to order in small amounts more frequently than have tons of food leftover. 

Initially it is slow to get your food and you may begin to wonder if they have forgot all about you upstairs, but once it starts coming, be prepared, it will all be there for you! 

More than once there has been a language barrier with the waitress. When I asked her to explain what was didn't understand what I was asking her or how to respond. A few times I have had to go search of her to get more water too, but not a big deal overall as the food is always so good. 

My family and I get  takeout frequently and it is always great - just as if we were in the restaurant. It takes no more than 20min before it is ready. 

Parking can be a little tricky during the day. There's paid meter parking and a parking garage close by. If you go after 6pm though, the metered parking is free. 

I will continue to go to this restaurant regularly!"}
{"text":"It is a sushi restaurant the food is really good but the service is absolute crap!! It is all you can eat and my boyfriend and I went there and didn't know that what is was and the lady yelled at us for not eating all of our food. They say seat yourself but then tell you where to sit. The dinner price is quit a lot ($30 per adult) if you aren't going to eat enough. You can also order in but it takes 2 hours for them to deliver."}
{"text":"\"Walking in, first thing we noticed was the hand-carved, wooden stair railing leading upstairs. With prolonged, continuous, organic shapes, it left a strong impression on both of us. We both were a bit distracted for a few moments as we entered and the open two story restaurant, with a trendy bar on the lower floor and a mezzanine-like second floor. \"
\"Yaki Udon had a slight burned grill smell and a bit of bland broth in the bottom. We didn't find it very flavorful, but the sesame seeds on top were a nice addition to the pile of noodles, veggies and chicken. Plus the portion was generous, considering the affordable price. \"

Just a taste of our short & sweet!"}
{"text":"Great location! Food is fresh! No tummy-aches!

One of my top picks in downtown Oakville's lakeshore region. For an all-you-can-eat, you get surprisingly good quality meats and fish. I didn't find this expensive, finishing up at $54 after tips. My girlfriend and I were very satisfied. 

The service was really quick, our finished vanished with an blink of an eye. Also everything was organized, food appeared almost instantly. Literally..... 

My only regret is not taking photos of all the plates we ordered. They dressed up every plate even if there was only 2 pieces of fish on it. 

Turn up that air conditioning please! You would have gotten 5 stars from us!!!

We will return again definitely!!!"}
