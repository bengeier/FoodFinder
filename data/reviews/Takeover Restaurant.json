{"text":"The customer service at this restaurant stinks.  If you want to have rude wait staff and bad service, please go to the establishment.  I asked for the owner or manager and the older lady at the counter said that she could not take a message and she didnt' know when the manager would be in.  I cannot say how the food is but I will say that the rude unprofessional staff will make me not frequent there again."}
{"text":"They have really good food and nice service. I ordered the Chicken philly and it was huge and it came with a lot of fries. My children love their whole wings and they are picky eaters. I also had a polish boy but didn't get to eat it. I was also quite large. They definitely give you your money's worth."}
{"text":"Great! Excellent customer service. Food was just like I asked them to fix it. I highly recommend them to everyone. And the portion Wow. Thanks takeover restaurant see you guys tomorrow. My new second home."}
{"text":"Good food good prices!! Had the chicken philly fries and they were very good great everyone was very friendly i will be back"}
