{"text":"I went to BarBurrito for lunch and got their burrito (bowl) of the day for $5.  
For $5, I didn't expect a whole lot of meat and there wasn't.  
AND... they didn't drain the meat or beans before putting it in the container so it has a lot of excess liquid.

I asked for the advertised Add2 Items for $2, I chose chips with salsa and a bottle of water.
Now, at this point, I'm expecting the cost to be $7+tax.

I was charged $7.60 for the burrito $2 for the extra two items. Came to $9.60+tax = $10.85.

I inquired why it's so much more...and the owner/cashier said that I couldn't apply the Add2 items promo onto the burrito of the day.  I didn't want to have a confrontation after a difficult morning already, so I didn't argue it.

But then... just doing quick math in my head...
If he charged me $5 for the burrito, $2 for the chips and $1.50 for the water, that's $8.50 and with tax it would be $9.60

Not saying that the cashier should have done the math for me, but considering he should know the prices, why would be not help the paying customer save a bit of money.  

The food was meh, have had way better burrito bowls else where Fat Bastards, Chipotle, Burrito Boys etc... all are better in my opinion. 

I will not be coming back to this place or any other Bar Burrito's out there."}

{"text":"Worst service , found a fly in my food , stay away! Management sucks ! They told me they were having money problems and didn't refund my order."}
{"text":"Got a reg sized burrito this thing was huge and it was soo yummy. It was a little expensive but huge."}
{"text":"Saw this place opening close to my house so I gave it a try. I ordered a chicken quesadilla and my friend ordered a burrito and both were delicious! They didn't hold back on toppings and more importantly meat. Everything is fresh as well. Stuff was very nice and friendly. Highly would recommend."}
