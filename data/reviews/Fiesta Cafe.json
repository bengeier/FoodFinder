{"text":"I'd give it 4 stars for the margaritas and the service. Our server was really nice and attentive. 

The food though, has much to be desired. Last night we went there and I got chicken tacos. They were so horrible that I only took one bite. My friend got the same thing and she also didn't eat more than one bite. They were that bad. The chicken tasted like it was canned. 

The chips are good and the salsa isn't too bad either. They're generous with the chips and keep them coming, good thing too since that's what I ate for dinner since my tacos stunk. 

Good place to go if you're just looking for 'ritas and chips."}
{"text":"Three stars for the food, and an extra for the great margaritas;

Food-wise, I left full but don't remember being too impressed based on the number on the receipt, but the service I had was good.

They've got a wide selection of tequilas to fit you budget or tastes, and the mix was pretty good, too."}
{"text":"I agree with many of the criticisms listed by other reviewers (chips not great, some dishes can be bland, etc), but Fiesta is still my favorite Mexican place in CU. I am a vegetarian, and I love that they have such a good variety of dishes available without meat. I particularly love the chimichangas. I also am not a fan of refried beans, so I love that Fiesta has the option of black beans for all their dishes.  It is definitely a \"comfort food\" type of restaurant for me, cheap and cozy and consistent."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat. My wife and I always enjoy coming here. Service is excellent. I wish I could get here and actually grab a drink here. They have the best eggs. Gotta love the cool retro deco design too. Hoping this place stays around for a long time."}
{"text":"Used to love this place but recently had the worst meal in memory.  Every single item ordered was stale, or not up to par and the service was horrible.  They are going to have to up their came with Maize (the best place in town for Mexican) opening a larger location nearby."}
{"text":"Worst experience of my life in a restaurant.  The burrito I had was 90% refried beans and when the owner, Ron came over to the table he insulted me by telling me \"welcome to the Fiesta\".  In other words, it is what it is.  He said he has been making burritos this way for 28 years and everyone loves them he said.  I said I have been eating them for the same amount of time and I have never had one like this before.  No apology, just basically very defensive like, too bad, this is the way it is.  The server was outstanding so an appropriate tip was left. Honestly, the owner should take lessons in customer service from his staff. So unprofessional.  Also, referred to my wife as \"Hun\" when she was trying to make a point.  I have never been so angry in a restaurant before.  When I said I was going to post a bad review on Yelp, he said \"go ahead\".  When I said he has lost a customer, he said \"that's fine\".  We had been here many times in the past but never again.  There are better owners out there that care about their customers.  This one obviously could care less."}
{"text":"Te amo, Fiesta Cafe!  Having grown up in C-U, I've heard my fair share of how great Dos Reales is supposed to be, but everytime I eat there, I feel like I am being rushed out the door.  Fiesta on the other hand....well, there are few places I'd rather sit on the patio and have margaritas.  That, and the staff always recognize my husband and I and remember what we like, right down to the extra sour cream (no longer in those little paper wedges) and Island Margaritas.  Oh, man.  I'm making myself want to go there right now just thinking about it."}
{"text":"Not very authentic, and my rice was severely undercooked. They used yellow cheese on my tacos. Much better choices for Mexican food in Champaign."}
{"text":"If you're thinking about eating here, there are almost certainly better places you could go. I ordered the chiles rellenos and was pretty disappointed. Ingredients seemed low-quality and overall preparation was subpar. Everything was drowned in a red sauce that tasted canned. I have made this dish better at home. The place also isn't kept up very well, and the view from the patio where we sat was a little depressing. However, our server was a really nice guy. Overall I'd give the place one star based solely on food and atmosphere, but I bumped it up to two for the service."}
{"text":"Always run into people I know at this great place.  Been going here since they first opened more than 25 years ago.  It's a very friendly place with great food and awesome margaritas!"}
{"text":"I find it so wonderful that I can live in CU for this many years and still find new stuff that has been around for quite a while. I stopped into Fiesta Cafe after a friend told me about his first visit a week earlier. What attracted me the most was their (HUGE) margarita menu. I'm a pretty big tequila head and not a huge fan of Wedge in downtown champaign so I was really excited to try something new.

First of all, the drank. It was delicious. The margaritas aren't the cheapest things in the world if you get a decent tequila in them but I came for the higher end stuff so I didn't mind. I think it was around $7-8 for a 16 oz margarita that was maybe the best one I've had at a restaurant ever. I was so happy to just sit there sipping on it and eating the bottomless chips and salsa that I forgot that there was dinner to be had as well until my waiter reminded me!

As for the food, it's not perfect. I ordered the (HUGE) fajita quesadilla from the appetizer menu and the person I was with ordered the Alex tacos. The food tasted great, but it wasn't exactly authentic. But to be honest I feel like some kind of jerkoff for even saying that. When it comes down to it this place serves pretty great TexMex, which I don't mind at all. If you're looking to reach for your authenticity measuring stick every time you go to an \"ethnic\" restaurant, first of all quit it, and second of all this is not the place for you. But if you dig tequila and (HUGE) quesadillas then boy are you in for a treat. Will be back again and again and again."}
{"text":"I picked 4 stars, which means, according to Yelp, \"yay! I'm a fan.\"  And I am, because this is one of my go-to restaurants. It doesn't close at 7:30 pm, like every other place in town, so I think it gets a lot of business because it can cater to the crowd that doesn't eat dinner at 5 and then get all tuckered out around 8.

I considered writing a long review, but it really boils down to this: this place will stuff you with food, mostly chips and salsa if you're at my table, and they won't stop refilling everything until you tell them you can't eat any more.  Which you will do in a kind of thick, goopy voice because you're actually so full of food your body is storing it in your chest and throat.  I secretly think that the staff likes the spectacle of gluttony, but I don't care. When I go there, it's because I want to get fat and happy and that's what happens."}
{"text":"It's always interesting how everyone has their go-to mexican restaurant...mine, hands down, is Fiesta Cafe. I've been going here since I was a little kid and it's difficult to find another restaurant that can compete. I love how their salsa is always fresh, service is AWESOME, their margaritas are great (get the don julio blanco and you won't be disappointed) My favorite dish is Tacos Mexicanos with chicken and a side of rice with white cheese sauce...mhmmm, delicioso!"}
{"text":"Fairly priced. Friendly service. The food is not bad but overall lacks seasoning. My favorites were the enchiladas verdes de pollo and the rice. Pork burrito had way too much refried beans in it (I'd get it again and ask them to leave out the beans) but the pork was good. Salsa is not hot and pretty bland but they have a lot of hot sauce options on the tables. Alex tacos were flavorful but way too oily (I suspect they don't drain the fat from the seasoned, ground pork). Will visit again, try more things, and tailor my order given this experience."}
{"text":"I came to Fiesta with my husband last weekend for a late lunch.

We were immediately greeted upon entering the restaurant and Amy was our server. She provided quick menu recommendations and great service throughout our time at the restaurant.

We ordered the Alex Tacos and they were delicious! My husband and I each ordered the platter of three tacos and we both had leftover. Great for lunch the next day! The double layer of tortillas were delicious, the ground pork was flavorful, and I loved the spicy green sauce and cilantro. Great flavor combinations!

The chips and salsa tasted fresh and were refilled before we could even ask.

Try a margarita, too. You won't regret it. I'm not a tequila expert so I just ordered a Passion Fruit margarita but there are a lot of tequila/mezcal offerings.

We'll be back! :)"}
{"text":"We had a great server named Alfredo. He was really nice and was always checking on us. The food was really good and came out super quick. I also had their frozen strawberry margaritas and those were delicious! Definitely going back. Prices are also great."}
{"text":"Excellent food, exceptional service, great margaritas. Had the combo fajitas, chicken and shrimp. If there's one thing that could be improved on... I'd recommend they step-up the size of the shrimp. The table chips and salsa was the best I've had locally."}
{"text":"4 stars =  \"yah! I\"m a fan\" I guess that sums it up. I dig the funky vibe of Fiesta. I use to come here in my early twenties and gorge out. Back in those days, I had not yet been to many authentic taquerias. So I thought Fiesta was amazing. But then again, I also thought Dos Res was awesome. Over the yearsI learned to not just look for cheese covered meats with runny beans and \"orange rice\", I wanted basic simple Mexican. I  became a bit of a Mexican restaurant snob.  I moved away, had many many amazing Mexican dishes during my travels. Moved back to CU a couple years ago. Kinda went to Fiesta expecting to not dig it, based on memory that is. Well... i love this spot. It's a long standing tradition of downtown Champaign. I'm a fan of the enchiladas, chicken/mole to be exact. But my real deal it the \"mexican tacos\", three of those and some great guacamole. boom! Done! Good!
  It's not the most comfy lookin spot, the booths are a bit stiff sometimes, but it's Fiesta, get over it. The staff is super as well. They are pretty  great."}
{"text":"Went here the other day with two friends and had a really great time. We sat outside in their shaded patio that brought the most amazing breeze throughout the whole meal. They brought out chips with 2 salsas while we spent about 20 minutes looking at their very extensive menu. 

After about 15 minutes we decided on margaritas. They had the largest list of margaritas I've ever seen. I decided on the pomegranate one on the rocks. I truly enjoyed it. We finally decided on food which was the most difficult part of our visit because they had so many options! Me and one of my friends got their veggie burritos with queso dip on the side. My boyfriend got steak fajitas. 

While waiting for our food we enjoyed our drinks, the breeze and the Mexican music that truly took me out of Champaign and to the beaches of Mexico. Our food came out looking incredible. My boyfriends steak fajitas came out on a burning hot skillet with the most amazing aromas coming from it. My burrito came out perfectly and I enjoyed it until I was too full to continue. We all split our checks which didn't bother them which was nice. We left full and completely satisfied. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I love Fiesta Cafe. The Alex tacos are always the right choice, because they're huge and delicious. The large guacamole is well worth the money and the wait staff is always very nice and attentive."}
{"text":"I had a craving for Mexican food tonight... which happens rarely enough that I should I should indulge. I had no idea where to get good Mexican food in Champaign, but a quick Yelp search brought up Fiesta Cafe, which is conveniently located just a few blocks from my apartment, and also stays open everyday until 12am (an oddity in Champaign where a lot of restaurants are closed by 10pm). 

So I decided to check it out: I didn't actually eat there, only got food to go, but the restaurant seems pleasant enough that I will probably go back soon. I ordered the chicken mole, and it turned out to be quite good... in fact, surprisingly good and quite better than most Mexican food I had while I was in NYC. It's also very reasonably priced, and the service was very friendly. Nice place!"}
{"text":"I went to Fiesta Café because they were the only Mexican establishment, at the time, serving pork tacos. I was disappointed. The pork tacos were made sweet with some sort of pineapple concoction, and the tortillas were store-bought. I much prefer tortillas that restaurants make themselves.

On the plus side, this is one of the Mexican restaurants that tends to offer coupons via the mail. When I dined on a Monday night, Fiesta Cafe had a lot of older couples taking advantage of the discount."}
{"text":"This is a cool place to get some Mexican grub and a Marg on the patio in the summertime. It has a nice attitude that feels very independent, spunky, and spontaneous. The menu is akin to a university neighborhood- very casual and slightly experimental without alot of fuss. Four stars is for the the overall vibe- Enjoy it for what it is!!"}
{"text":"Really good food, everything I try has been hot and tasty!  Did not like the first time I went many years ago, but they seem to have hit their stride these days and keep impressing me."}
{"text":"DO NOT GET THE NACHOS. I ordered the \"vegetarian nachos\" and the cheese and beans were BURNED (it looked microwaved) and it had a huge pile of shredded lettuce on top. I very politely told the waiter that I did not like the food because it was burned and he said \"okay I'll let them know\". Then came back with my check!!! So I had to pay for burned food that I didn't even eat!!!! Very dissatisfied and I will never return."}
{"text":"Amy is literally my favorite person ever. 
Whenever she's working I'm alway overjoyed to have her as my server. I've never had a bad experience with the food nor the service by any staff members. The margaritas (literally any one of them) and the veggie fajita are my go to's each time! 
Meat lovers and veggies will have no problem finding something to love!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place, but it seems the food isn't as good as it used to be. My beef burrito was mostly beans and almost  no beef. We were given menus outside and told to find our own seats inside - not the best for customer service - although our waiter was excellent. $2 Pacifico beer was a plus."}
{"text":"Chips and salsa - Bad had to sprinkle salt on em for flavor! The food, maaaaan!  Not again, EVER!!! I love Amy tho! LOL"}
{"text":"Very good greasy-spoon Mexican place.  My husband and I both had margaritas, and they were great- not too sweet, nice amount of salt.  Make sure you look at all of the options- we ordered \"fresh\" which uses fresh lime juice.  They have tons of tequila choices.  Nachos we shared were good, and the small order was more than enough for two of us.

My husband had the mixed fajitas, and enjoyed them.  Portion was huge, and we brought about half of it home. I had the pozole and Alex taco.  Both were flavorful.  Pozole had a nice amount of spice.  

We'll return."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in shampoo banana. Hands down.  Huge portions, standard Mexican food prices, generally not a wait (and if there is, it's not 2 hrs, like some places in Champaign)."}
{"text":"Ah, Fiesta Cafe.

You do not deserve all five stars on food alone, but there are so many additional factors.

First off, Fiesta Cafe is a flagrantly ridiculous adobe structure, looking as if it was transplanted straight from the American Southwest into the midst of First Street in Champaign.  Ridiculous.  Awesome.  Hilarious.

Next, the service is fast, friendly, and the food delicious.  I ordered the chilequiles, which I'm a bit particular about.  I also wanted them with scrambled eggs, which seemed odd and self-indulgent, but they did it PERFECTLY.  And I was delighted.  The food was great, and i was pleasantly surprised as I thought it'd suck or be midwesternly bland.

Finally, as I left the patio, full and happy, i stopped and looked about.  There are a plethora of flags, American, Mexican, Peace, LGBT Rainbow, a whole plethora of flagtasticness.  'Twas nice to see a cool, friendly environment.

So, in conclusion: Ridiculous pueblo, frighteningly good chilequiles, flagtasticness, wondrous service.  I was delighted."}
{"text":"I used to come here when Fiesta Cafe first opened up in the late 80s. I'm back at U of I for a year on a sabbatical leave and although the restaurant has changed a great deal the food is still great, and a great deal. The wait staff are very pleasant; the terrace is nice and the food keeps me coming back after all these years. 

The chorizo is my favourite burrito. Spicy but very flavourful and hugely filling!!

So happy that they're still around."}
{"text":"Love the cimichanga with a huge strawberry margarita at Fiesta! Fun place to eat out and the chips and salsa are good as well."}
{"text":"I came as part of a big group - we estimated 30 but came with 40, about half an hour earlier than expected, and we were still received very well by the staff. Our server was so knowledgeable about the menu and told us about their specialties and informed us about the vegetarian options. She was very nice and patient to all of us, continually making sure we were refilled with horchata (free refills on horchata whaaaat), salsa, or chips. I got the Alex Tacos and asked for no spicy salsa on them, and when I got my food she brought the salsa in a bowl on the side for me to try, and I ended up loving it! The tacos were also loaded up and overflowing and every plate was very hot to the touch, so no one got cold food or left hungry. The cebollitos on the tacos were so amazing! Finally, she brought each table boxes for leftovers and our checks before we asked for them."}
{"text":"Food was very bland. It didn't taste like anything. The guacamole was good though. Oh well"}
{"text":"The quesadilla was excellent and the rice was decent and our waiter was supper nice to us. We didn't have any problems with this place. We will be back again soon."}
{"text":"Visited the Fiesta as part of a large group.  Right off I discovered a friendly and fun atmosphere.  Complementary chips and salsa on each table started things off.  Our server was at tentative and professional.  All meals and drinks were served promptly and little delay between the members of our large group.  My chimichanga was perfect.  But the most amazing part of the meal was the incredible number of margaritas available-all at reasonable prices.  Overall the Fiesta Cafe is a first rate dining experience.  The only negative was a not so great band - but by then I had enjoyed 3 margaritas and the band was tolerable."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite sit down mexican restaurant in town.  When you walk in they hand you menus and you are able to pick wherever you want to sit which I love.  I usually order the Vegetarian Fajita's which are incredible and include tomatoes, red and green peppers, onions, zucchini and squash.  I hope I'm not forgetting anything in there.  You also get to choose corn or flour tortillas and black or refrained beans which is also a bonus.  
There is a nice patio area for those days or nights when we actually have nice weather.  Amy is the greatest server, but the rest are pretty good too!  For an appetizer I would suggest a side of guac if you don't want too much, but if you're in a group Guacamole Grande is the way to go!  Also white cheese sauce with chorizo is very good."}
{"text":"Champaign, IL is a place in which I've learned many tragic truths in this thing called life. One of the more prominent ones, specifically in relation to the central-Illinois locale, is that there is no good Mexican food here. You may recieve recommendations and you may choose to believe them, but remember this: it's all relative.

During my 3 year stay in this small midwestern town, I was duped into trying the fare at a variety of Mexican eateries. Always hoping to replicate my Pilsen, Clark Street or the lady that sells tamales out of a cooler experience I never turned down an invite. On a recent trip back in search of gainful employment (in the form of a university sponsored job fair) I was implored to try Fiesta Cafe. It was the straw that broke the camel's back.

Quantity over quality appears to be the motto here, as it is at many C-U establishments. I ordered tamales and was greeted with rubbery and unpleasant masa wrapped around a minimal amount of chicken. The sour cream did indeed come in a school lunch single serving container as mentioned in another review, and the rice and beans were sorely lacking in positive qualities. 

I gave two stars, however, because the service was good and they carried tamarind Jarritos. Tamarindo! The food was edible, but it just wasn't quite what I'd expected."}
{"text":"This place tastes like Mexican food made for people that don't really like Mexican food. It's not very spicy and the flavors feel muted compared to more authentic restaurants. Sincerely we've moved out here we've looked for good Mexican restaurants, and so far we are still looking for a good place.

The best thing this place has going for it is a fairly nice ambiance that I imagine is really awesome once it's hot out."}
{"text":"Fish tasted fake and bland. 
Chips were alright though. Service was aight too. But the fish was simply terrible."}
{"text":"The staff is amazing. I would go here just to hang out with these kind and engaged people.

The food is what I'm looking for when I go to a Mexican restaurant; and I spent 14 years in Arizona where there's lots of great Mexican food. One main drawback here tbough: the lack of spinach enchiladas or calabacitas. There needs to be a truly vegan option.

The margarita selection is almost intimidating, but the friendly staff is happy to make excellent recommendations. I had the Island Margarita and my husband had the Passion Fruit Margarita. Next time we go back we have a great idea of what to try next, thanks to Alfredo's insightful recommendations.

The salsa was a pretty standard pico, but there were great sauce add-ins to choose from and they enhanced the salsa perfectly. I feel like the chips might be from a bag (not made fresh in the kitchen? correct me if I'm wrong...) but they did the job.

I got the veggie fajitas (no sour cream) and my husband got the veggie fajita burrito (no cheese, no sour cream). The fajita platter was huge! I am always happy to see a heap of veggies on my plate, and this dish did not disappoint. The flavor was typically fajita, so that worked out just fine. The burrito was large and wrapped in a spinach tortilla. Nice. The red rice was pretty much bland (I'm REALLY picky about red rice), and the black beans were standard, but when I combined them with the fajita I was more than pleased with my meal.

I will be back to this place."}
{"text":"For my money, the best chicken fajitas in town.  I only wish the salsa was a little better.  But certainly not bad.

Amy is a great server, an institution here.

Love the atmosphere just off campus."}
{"text":"I have friends who swear by this place, but I just swear.
Why on earth would you go here when you can go to Maize?
Unless you're drinking Margaritas.
Then you'll come here and get smashed."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a negative 10. I spent 17 dollars for 4 steak tacos and small fries. Worst money spend on food EVER!! The food is horrible the steak is chewy, barely any flavor, and was undercooked. I had to add salt to the meat. I should've taken the food back but I was being lazy. If you want good tacos go to Fernando's or Maize. Fernando's is the best fyi and reasonable prices. Don't listen to these other reviews because this place is gross ."}
{"text":"This place is great. Gay night every Wednesday in the back room with Amy. Her margaritas are ON POINT and her attitude is perfect. She's fun to work with and always has a smile on her face. I love trying new things here (which is rare for me). Great atmosphere, great service, amazing margaritas - hope to see you Wednesday night!"}
{"text":"Laid back place. I had the best carnitas tacos (\"mexicano style\" soft corn tortillas, lime & cilantro) but honestly, some of the worse rice & beans I've ever had....skip those. And the sour cream comes in the little packages like you would get at Wendy's or something....The complimentary chips and salsa were great, and the staff friendly and attentive. Pretty decent food overall. We had a party of 8 for lunch and surprisingly they accommodated us immediately, but the place filled up quickly, and not all with just college students. FYI-The lunch specials are yummy and a great price-check them out."}
{"text":"I've been coming here sporadically for 2+ years. EXCELLENT food and the service is just as great, all the staff are friendly and polite. Tacos Mexicanos are phenomenal, the chicken chimichangas are great and the mole is DECADENT! Chips and salsa are also really tasty!"}
{"text":"I always enjoy the chipolte steak soft tacos and the black beans!"}
{"text":"I freaking love this place. I'm a foody and Mexican is my favorite. I just wish I found it earlier!!! More authentic than something super Americanized like Maize. I would recommend this place to everyone and anyone!"}
{"text":"Very casual, comfortable place, a little further off campus.  Laid back.  AWESOME vegetarian burritos and chimichangas, good guac, and I like them Margaritas man!  Huevos rancheros is another favorite of mine.  The vegetarian food there is truly so, you don't have to ask if it's made with clam sauce, chicken broth, lard, etc.  Small place with an expanded dining room in back, and sometimes gets rather busy, but some of the best Mexican in Champaign."}
{"text":"I just discovered this place recently after 5 years of living in Champaign and always wanted to give it a try.

Our server was very friendly. Service was 4~5 star. 
I'd give the food 3.5 stars. We ordered a horchata, a burrito dinner and the El Presidente. The horchata was SO GOOD! It's perfectly sweetened, very fragrant and smooth! 
I used to work in New Mexico and really enjoyed New Mexican food. The burrito and El Presidente we ordered at Fiesta were good but were slightly lack of flavor compared to the food I had in NM. I liked the chicken taco in the El Presidente. The chicken was very juicy. However, the steak in my enchilada was on the drier side. They do give a huge portions. Each dish could be two meals for an adult.

They also have a long margarita menu (ranges between $5.5 to $12+). Would love to try their margaritas in my next visit."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food in town! You can't go wrong with cheese or beef enchiladas here, truly amazing! Also they have excellent salsa and chips-fresh and homemade.  Amy is also a great waitress"}
{"text":"Always great food and service .......the drinks are amazing...................amy is the best server"}
{"text":"This was awful.  Base on the reviews from this site we decided to check it out.  I reallly wanted to like it, it's close to home, has awesome architecture, great outside seating and good atmosphere.  Howerver that's when the good times stopped.  The chips showed up and were so stale they had to have been out of the bag since early last week.  The salsa was not tasty at all and the sour cream came in cafeteria packets or \"in baked potato packets from Golden Corrall\" as Jessie says.

When the food showed up it was just as bland as the chips.  Jessie will eat just about any Mexican food on the planet but this was TERRIBLE.  I haven't a clue what other people enjoyed, maybe we managed t order the two things on the menu that are awful.

To top it all off there weren't any entertaining people in the whole place to pay attention to.  Just unacceptable.  

Needless to say we will not be visiting the Fiesta Cafe again, unless there is a Fiesta with lots of free booze."}
{"text":"Good service, very mediocre food.  Ordered a carnitas burrito with beans and rice."}
{"text":"Hands down the best service you'll get anywhere in CU. Fiesta is a really cute spot. It's family friendly but also a great environment for adults to meet up - I could see grabbing margaritas here in warmer weather.

The food is okay - the rice is super dry and tastes a bit stale, and while I appreciate the \"vegetarian\" options, essentially vegetarian here means stuffed with refried beans and nothing else. If Fiesta could supply inventive vegetarian dishes - for which Mexican cuisine provides so many interesting ingredients and options - I'd be a lot more excited."}
{"text":"Fiesta Cafe is a staple just northwest of the University of Illinois campus. The food is authentic, served fresh to order, and absolutely delicious. The prices are reasonable, and there are plenty of selections to choose from on their menu. However, you won't find a \"Speedy Gonzales\" or \"Lunch Special # (1-10)\" like every other El Toro, El Matador, Dos Toros, Dos Locos, or whatever other not-a-chain-but-all-the-same-menu restaurants in the midwest. I'm personally a fan of the El Popo Lunch with Alex Pork in my burrito and Chorizo in my taco. Great food, great service, and a great place to hang out for drinks too."}
{"text":"They have massively awesome margaritas, and are super vegetarian friendly. Had the vegetarian fajitas, and my wife had the chicken burrito.  We both had the black beans. The service was fast, and the staff made a point of making relevant suggestions, and letting us know things we didn't even think to ask. Food beats the hell out of the other Mexican places in town."}
{"text":"Great staff, comfortable booths, great for a group, family or couple, great prices, location next to new park great to walk off a full meal. One of the first restarants in town, they authentic."}
{"text":"Chips and salsa were freshly made. The entrees look better than they tasted. They were made fresh but just a little bland. Chimichanga and burrito ok. Chicken tacos were good. Tamale was good. Service was good."}
{"text":"As the saying goes:  I've got 99 problems.  Unfortunately the flavor and heat level at Fiesta ain't even close to being one.  FC was so crowded that ye olde boy friend and I  held out hope for a Mexican experience that would put the culinary and GI horror that was El Toro out of mind.  We're still waiting for the GI results, but at this point I think we're ready to call it:  unless you want to be depressed and wallow in milquetoast mexican food, don't go here.  The ambience was fine.  It was bright and kitschy in ways I find endearing.  

Getting the order wrong and forgetting a side?  Forgivable.  
Ruining tequila with a syrupy excuse of a marguerita? bad news.  
Swapping the meats on my BFs platter? worse news.  
Unflavorful and rubbery fish tacos smothered in soggy slaw and served on a plate where everything was white:  death.  
A soggy fry job on a cimichanga: death warmed over.  

I feel like mexican food is easy to get right:  it is my go-to for home meals when I have nothing on hand.  With beans, cheese, lime juice, salt, something in the pepper family, a tomato and a tortilla -- it is easy to be great.  If you start there and possible add cumin then there is nothing you can do wrong.  I'd be happy to assist FC if they would like to develop this concept.  Until then, I'll just be over here soaking some beans and making my delicious oyster mushroom fajitas."}
{"text":"This rating is inflated because of the location: I\"m coming from the Bay Area where there are tons of great Mexican joints and Fiesta doesn't really compete with them, but it's by far the best we have here in C-U. In fact, it may be my favorite restaurant in town.
They actually have carnitas, which is a godsend, and all their dishes are executed well. The burritos don't have rice, which is weird and makes them messy, but I actually enjoy the result; more beans and meat is not a bad thing. They give you free chips with two salsas, one spicy and one mild. All the meat I've had there has been top quality and the beef isn't stringy like at so many other places. Also the margarita menu is intense, they have like 20 types of tequila, which I appreciate though it's not really my style."}
{"text":"Great food every time and Amy is the best server! Very warming atmosphere, a great place to come and relax!"}
{"text":"This place has been very hit-or-miss with me.  The setting is always nice, especially with shady outdoor seating during the summer.

I have had a couple of the vegetarian combination plates that were pretty sub-par, even compared to Dos Reales or a similar American Mexican place.  Most of the meat dishes I've had, though, (burritos, tacos, nachos) were pretty good.  And they do chiles rellenos well."}
{"text":"Good authentic traditional Mexican food!
Service was good; timely cadence of order.
Wasn't too thrilled with the guacamole: way too much lime juice for me: I love avocado, and you couldn't really taste the flavor other than the lime.

Good variety of salsa's to try with chips.

Being picky; I love my beans smashed: they served my black beans whole - just a preference thing, however they still tasted great.

Chile Rellanos was good as was the chicken enchiladas."}
{"text":"Not very impressive when the host hands you the menus and tells you your booth is in the back???  Margarita good:). Fish tacos and chips not stellar;(. Would not return:("}
{"text":"As a taco superfan, Fiesta Cafe is absolutely in my rotation to get my fix. I love the Alex Tacos which is some delicious combination of pork, onion, cilantro and salsa verde. 

Before my tacos are brought to the table, the server brings a mild salsa, a hot salsa, and 3 bottles of mystery sauces that range from mild and smokey, to burn your face off. And I like them all. 

Their tequila selection rivals Wedge, and they also offer a hearty handful of mezcals. Beers are cheap too! $2 pints of Dos Equis, and sometimes $2 bottles of Modelo. 

My only criticism is the layout of the restaurant. The parking lot is not accommodating to the number of tables they have. I usually end up parking off the beaten path in a gravel alley.  The dining room you walk into from outside is really cramped, loud, and not comfortable to be in. If you keep walking to the back room (where the bar is), its much more spacious and pleasantly decorated. 

Overall, I will return. Just sit in the back!"}
{"text":"A top choice for Mexican food. My personal favorite are the Alex tacos. Seriously the best tacos. Great patio to sit out and enjoy a margarita on."}
{"text":"My family's favorite place in the Champaign area to get Mexican food. Much higher quality food and margaritas than any other place we have tried and we have tried them all many times! Fiesta is always awesome service and it's always a great meal"}
{"text":"Great service! Margaritas are fantastic! And our food was out within 7 minutes! Waiter was very friendly. I would recommend this restaurant who is trying to get away from the local standards like el toro. Awesome quality in food as well."}
{"text":"The typical Tex-Mex place.  Another spot in Champaign that seems like it has been open forever.  The building is made of adobe, with a great shaded outdoor seating area.  A few dinning areas inside with a bar in the back room as well.

Service is hit or miss, depending on how many people are here.  The food is very typical for this kind of joint.  Tacos, burritos, chimichanga, and various lunch specials and combinations.  Globs of refried beans and starchy rice.  A bunch of different margaritas, and a crap beer list.

That is it.  Good for a nostalgic trip when visiting the family.  Though nothing to go out of your way for."}
{"text":"Nice patio to sit outside and have margaritas! Amy was our server and was very nice, friendly and even shared her knowledge of the different tequilas and how they're made. Make sure you go inside to check out Elvis."}
{"text":"Waiting over 20 minutes to put in a take-out order is one thing; waiting over 20 minutes after people that showed up after you were all attended to individually, including by the restaurant's owner, is embarrassing. To then pawn off that customer service on condescending and dismissive staff is pathetic. And to have your staff explain it away by being \"busy\" is hilarious: if you can't handle \"busy,\" don't get into the restaurant business, either as owner or employee.

My previous experience with this restaurant's malignant approach to being a neighbor aside (their still-ongoing renovations have been done with as much consideration of their also-rent-paying neighbors as you'd expect from particularly rude landmines), this place has shown itself to be a clueless operation every time, but especially this last one. Get better value for your money: put it in a pile and burn it, but only after writing \"at least this money is not going to Fiesta Cafe\" on each bill in permanent marker."}
{"text":"Always wanted to try this place. I wish I had when I was a student.

Met friends here. 4 of us use wheelchairs and we all fit at a table, so it is accessible. Unsure about the restroom.

It was very loud during dinner on a Wednesday and the parking lot was very full. So minus a star for that.

Shared the asada relleno meal, chile relleno, and horchata. Loved their horchata; very milky.  It came with free refills. Liked the meat in the asada relleno. Never heard of asada relleno before; it was like stir fried veggies with juicy meat, beans, rice, and tortillas. The chile relleno was good, a bit sour.

Free chips and salsa for dine in."}
{"text":"Fiesta Cafe has the best Mexican in Champaign/Urbana. Everything isn't made with the same ground beef, there are choices. Ordered a beef taco and had 4 choices of beef from ground to a chipotle marinade. On a nice night, outdoor seating is fun. Great Mexican beer selection and drink specials occur."}
{"text":"I love coming here. There's a lot of margaritas to choose from and the staff is always friendly. The food and the drinks are great!"}
{"text":"I read a few reviews about this place before I went.  Unfortunately I should have followed the negative reviews. The Flank steak was just strips of greasy meat they probably put in the tacos.  The rice was drenched in grease.  It even smelled bad as the waiter put it in front of me.  I actually gasped.  Let me tell you I LOVE, LOVE mexican food, and I truly got better mexican food off a truck stop (which was amazing, I might add) in Los Angeles.  I mean wow they have great service, a great atmosphere, and I didn't have a margarita (which I love) but the list was extensive.  I bet they are good.   Now, on to the first indication that the food would be bad, the CHIPS! omg out out a bag, just horrible.  The salsas were good.  The contrast of all these good things with very bad ones made me give the place the 2 stars.  I promise you I will not be going back.  Too mad for them because, as I said, I love mexican food!  I could pay a servicer's  tips in a year with the amount of times I've hit Maize and Mas Amigos"}
{"text":"BUYER BEWARE!  Terrible food and horrible \"service\"!  Stephen's review below is exactly what happened to us. Cost-cutting on food is inexcusable and so is having a server and manager with a \"so what, too bad attitude\".  Cheap food preparation: Cans of refried bean mush in a chimichanga instead of beef, potatoes (I think) mixed in with chicken tamales (what the heck are potatoes doing in a tamale?), tiny holders of sour cream, rice definitely not freshly prepared. Even though the lunch menu clearly states one side with entree, I was charged for the rice. \"Sorry\", said the server and \"manager\", mistake on the menu.  Say what? You have an \"error\" on your menu and don't honor it? I needed a separate check for expenses. \"Sorry\", said the server, we no longer do this. Say what? The driest tamales I've ever had: unwrapped before brought to the table. Dry, dry, dry. Were these made several days ago and reheated in a microwave? Upon telling the \"manager\" of our dissatisfaction, he shrugged his shoulders and didn't care in the least. Mentioning a poor review on Yelp, he said \"OK\". Well, here it is. Just awful. If you are thinking of going--stay clear and be forewarned."}
{"text":"I love this place! As soon as I come back for a visit I'm going to get an Alex Taco! 
Also Amy is the best waitress!"}
{"text":"This place was poppin! We had to park in the Dallas and Co. Parking lot cause the Parking Lot was full. The entire structure is pretty cool- they've been pretty successful with an attempt to 'Go Adobe'. 

Overall, the food though wasn't that great. I guess I might just have really high expectations for mexican food because I love it. I ordered their 'Mexican Combo Dinner' and got a beef tamale, chile con queso, chorizo enchilada and the enchilada was my fave.."}
{"text":"This place reminded me of Burrito King. Tried the Fish Filet Dinner with rice/pinto beans. It was great, and way too much! Friend didn't like the black beans much though. Excellent service, they serve chips and salsa too."}
